1,Big diappointment,"Cry was good on the radio, so I bought the CD. What a waste. This might be an OK CD for a romantic dinner, but it will get on your nerves since most of the tracks sound the same.There is no catchy tunes on this CD. All the songs are really slow. There was nothing there that just grabs you. There weren't any tunes that were really upbeat, just constant droning. Breathe was tons better.Best description for this CD is sellout (and not in a good way)."
1,What happened?,"In accordance with some other reviews on this album, I would suggest buying just the CD single of Cry and saving the rest of your money. I am a huge Faith fan, and have been disappointed by this effort. Usually on her albums, especially the past two, the best part is that you can listen to every song on the album. Now, I am skipping almost all of the songs, especially the ones between Cry and Stronger. I hope she doesn't forget what kind of music got her to where she is now."
2,Disappointment for Faith Hill Fan,"Faith should not be trying to go ""POP"" and give the people what they want. Barbra Streisand tried this during the '70's and failed. I hope Faith learns from this CD and goes back to putting out CD's that reflect her real talent."
2,dissappointed fan,Save your money! I bought this cd for [X] and still feel it was a waste of 10 bucks! Cannot believe Faith released this album! She has such a beautiful voice but this cd does not do her justice at all!!!! Some decent songs but mostly to depressing sounding!!! I just hope this doesnt become a trend for her future recordings!!! Please Faith tell us you haven't lost your touch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,A CD to cry over,"Faith Hill's earlier CD featuring Breathe and other tracks is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. Truly romantic and sensual. Unfortunately, I took on 'faith' that her latest CD would be at least as good as that one. What a mistake! The songs all run together, little new or original and there is nothing to make me even want to hear even one track again. A real disappintment."
2,Cry,The worst album yet. I miss the country in her. She is trying to be something that she is not. Totally not worth buying.
5,"Different, but Great!","Faith Hill's new album is different from her past works but it does what music should do. The music on this album moves your soul. Not only is it filled with a soulful collection of songs but it contains a lot of rhythym that makes you want to get up and move. The songs are strong and so is her voice. As a long time fan, I think this is great addition to her collection!"
4,A NEW LEAP OF FAITH,"The long awaited release of Faith's new album, ""Cry"" is finally here! Being one of the first people to review her new album, I feel this a fresh, new start for her. Faith, having parting her country roots, has developed a new voice in diva-hood with 14 new songs including her #1 hit ""Cry"". To that end, a good portion of Cry consists of the best cuts -- ""Unsaveable,"" ""If You're Gonna Fly Away,"" ""Stronger"",and ""This Is Me"". Faith brings both of her gospel and diva sides together on this album. From one hit to another, this album is pretty damn impressive!"
4,Wow!!!,i really like this album... please listen to it because it will take a special meaning to your heart!!!
1,I'm losing faith in Faith,"I have loved Faith for quite a while. I love country and pop so I am not one of the people ""crying"" about how she sold out. Faith has a great voice. I like the song ""Cry"" but had a headache after listening to the album. I sounds like garbage. ""Breathe"" wasn't much better. I was hoping that her new album ""Cry"" would be a great album, especially after hearing the title track. Unfortunately, I was terribly mistaken."
2,"If you are a country fan, it is not worth it","The new album by Faith Hill, Cry, is very disapointing to this fan. This album is more pop than country. She is trying to please her new fans, but she is leaving her old ones in the cold. Please Faith, remember who brought you where you are today."
2,dissappointed fan,Cannot believe Faith released this album! She has such a beautiful voice but this cd does not do her justice at all!!!! Some decent songs but mostly to depressing sounding!!! I just hope this doesnt become a trend for her future recordings!!! Please Faith tell us you haven't lost your touch!!!
1,I REALLY CRY TO THIS...,"I don't understand what happen here, Faith's voice is impacable, but the songs are just missing something, the album is well produced, great photos, and everything, but the magic and easy feeling that caracterized Hill's album is somehow lost, ""Cry"" has a chorus line that don't hit big...""One"" is nice, but the rest of the album is just out of touch, I still believe Faith has talented and she will work it out just fine by the next album, but this is just not good."
3,Could you shout just a little?,"This was not one of Faith's best albums. Most of the time she's not singing, she's shouting. On some of her songs, it sounds like she's straining to hit some of the high notes. Like some pop rhythms on there, she's not giving her best effort. This is a must-have for Faith Hill fans, but not for others."
2,Boring,"I don't mind country singers trying to move away from their roots and trying something with more cross-over appeal, but at least make it interesting. This album is boring. I own all of Faith Hill's albums and was extremely disappointed by this one. One day soon the two best songs on this album (""Cry"" and ""When the Lights Go Down"") will appear on a Faith Hill's Greatest Hits collection and then I'll never have another reason to listen to this messy album."
2,Where did Faith Go?,"I bought Cry today. I have to admit I hated Cry when I first heard it, but then I grew to really like it. However, this album is not the Faith I know and love. I really liked Breathe. It had some great songs on it that could minimally pass for country ballads maybe. But this album. Not hardly! I have 2 maybe 3 songs on this CD that are good. Cry is okay. Stongest songs are definitely Stronger and When The Lights Go Down, which if given any airplay will probably be chart toppers for Faith. However, I sure feel that this album should not be played on country radio. It isnt fair to other artists who actually sing country music. She is far from country on this one. Probably a grammy winner, but should stay on AC where it belongs. Faith Hill please come back to country. You have a great voice and we need you. If this album can be played on country then pull out Chris Gaines too!!!"
5,FAITH IS AN AMAZING WOMAN!! UNBROKEN74 - I-SQUAD,"FAITH HILL HAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SOULFUL VOICES I'VE EVER HEARD! I THINK AMAZONS REVIEW WAS SO WRONG AND UNFAIR. IT'S GREAT MUSIC!AND TO ALL THE FAITH BASHERS WHO ""AREN'T HER FAN ANYMORE"" BECAUSE SHE ""DOESN'T SOUND COUNTRY ANMORE"", YOU WERE NEVER A FAN TO BEGIN WITH THEN. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WITH SO MUCH TALENT BE BOUND BY GENRE? IT'S RIDICULOUS, TO ME. HOW IS HER EXPANDING HER HORIZONS AND EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT MUSIC STYLES A SLAP IN ANYONES FACE? SHE'S AN AMAZING WOMAN WITH AMAZING TALENT, BEAUTY ETC... AND I APPLAUD HER FOR NOT CONFORMING TO ANYONES STANDARDS. GO FAITH!!!!NOT TO MENTION THAT SHE'S GOT AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY! WHICH REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER MUSIC, I JUST HAD TO SAY IT. LOL!!!!"
5,Awesome!!,Cry is Faith's best CD yet! It is amazing!! I could listen to it over and over again forever and not get tired of it! It is a great mix between cool uptempo songs and beautiful ballads! Way to go Faith!!
4,Faith's New Sound,I think this new cd is Faith's greatest accomplishment. Her new sound will appeal to people in many different genres. It deserves to be recognized and appreciated.
5,profiling this album,"faith hill has always brought us great music, and allthough she has crossed over to more of a pop sound she still continues to bring great music. people have complained about her not staying with her roots in country, but i have the feeling she will always keep her roots, and its always good for a singer to explore differnt things as long as the sound and lyrics remain great. this also give us a look at another side of faith. i will always remain a fan no matter what she writes and sings.profiler."
1,A Big Disapointment,"I am very disapointed in ""Cry"". It is not what I expected. There is absolutely no country in it. So if you are expecting country music here, you had better look elsewhere."
1,This Is What Is Ruining Country Music!,"Faith Hill is a no talent wannabe! After saying this let me explain that I don't think it was always this way. Back when Faith was actually singing country music I thought she was a very good singer with great songs. However, once she decided she wanted to make pop albums. I don't care if Faith wants to become a pop singer so long as she admits it instead of trying to label it as country and forcing those of us who want to listen to good country music listen to the imitation pop music she puts out."
2,Should have been titled YAWN,"Don't get me wrong--I think Faith is a talented vocalist, but I really believe she made some poor song choices on this album. After listening to it numerous times, I still come away feeling this is one of the most boring albums I've listened to in a while. After One, Cry, and Free, the CD loses its soulful groove and becomes a monontony of dull, sleepy songs that simply don't grab me. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I am seriously surprised at the number of good reviews this CD receives. I'm a Faith Hill fan but I can also admit she could have chosen a better mix of songs that would showcase her voice and give her a chance to spread her genre wings."
2,I Cried!,I have been a big Faith's and really still am. As much as I like her as a person I really didn't care for this cd. I became a fan of hers first because of the music she made. It was country music than turned me onto her music. On her cd's she had some uptempo and slower songs. This new cd is mostly slower tempo songs. The song 'Cry' is one of the faster songs on the cd. And the song in my opinion sounded too similar to 'There You'll Be'. Is that a fast song? The only uptempo song on this cd is the first one on the cd - 'Free'. And in my opinion it's not even a good song. I am sure by now most of you have heard 'When the Lights Go Down'. You basically get a cd of a bunch of songs that sound like 'When the Lights Go Down'. My favorites on the cd are 'Cry' and 'Beautiful' after that it is a very mediocre cd in my opinion. And for what used to be an automatic purchase (buying a Faith Hill cd) I will have to listen with caution in the future. If you like gospel music you may like this cd.
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews of this album. I am giving it 2 stars because there are only 2 good songs on this album, ""Cry"" and ""When The Lights Go Down."" The 2 main categories of music I listen to are Pop/Rock & Country, and she misses on both of these. There is too much noise on this CD, too much enhanced guitar, too much sythesizer. I applaud Faith Hill's attempt to move over to pop as that is how I would classify some of her best songs, but this CD just misses that mark entirely."
1,A missed chance,"Faith is obviusly looking to be recognised as a great singer not just a Country singer. The problem for me is very much as the first couple of reviews mentioned. This album is over produced and detracts from the great voice Faith has. She does not need all of that and I think that is why her earlier recordings allowed the voice to be centre stage.I would be very careful before I bought another of her albums if this is an example of where she is going, especially with the price of CDs in the UK"
1,Pop garbage marketed as Country,"I, for one, am completely over this Faith Hill mess (actually, I was never on board with it). This is pure garbage from the Nashville pop machine that has a really hard time marketing real Country music, thus their surprise at the success of O Brother, Where Art Thou?This CD is obviously marketed to young girls (she even looks like Britney Spears!?!?!).Avoid at all costs. For more like this garbage, see Shania Twain."
2,"One good track, a few decent ones, and lots of mediocrity","The ""Cry"" song is very good, but the problem with this album is that the rest of the content falls off quickly.There are not any terrible tracks on this album, but conversely there are very few good ones either. ""Cry"" was the only song I'd in fact worth listening to on this track for me.Most of the tracks range from mediocre to average.Faith's voice is good, that is not the problem. It just seems to me that most of the songs lack the feeling, catchy rythems, etc. of Faith Hill when she was at her best (which for me is by far her first two albums - ""Take Me as I Am"" and ""It Matters To Me"").There is too much hip hop sounds on this CD, and it is not clicking for me. While I don't mind hip hop on a hip hop album, this sound does not fit Faith Hill. I think she should stick with what she does best, country-pop with occasional full blown country."
5,Renewed fan!,"I've always liked Faith but haven't bought an album in a long time. I primarily bought this because I wanted more DVD-Audio discs for my car. The good reviews from those before me who purchased this disc convinced me to buy it and the Market Place seller had an amazing price. The good reviews were spot on. I knew ""Cry"" from the radio and like that song but I think the other songs are equally as great. I got more of an appreciation for her range and talent listening to this in 5.1 surround via my car system...really amazing.Would recommend to anyone to get this esp. for DVD-Audio purposes."
4,beautiful,"i love this album. faith's voice makes me wanna cry because it's so heartfelt and beautiful. ""when the lights go down"" is forever on my ipod...every time i hear it it reminds me that at the end of the day some things just arent what they seem to be, and you have to find happiness in things other than those things or you'll spennd your whole life wondering why you are evn here. great job to whoever wrote the song, but faith's voice definately brought the song to life. i love it!!"
1,"As much as I love faith hill, this album stunk...","As I was listening to this album, I really tried hard to listen for any country elements....the twang in the voice, the story-telling ballads, or the classic duets. As I continued to listen on, I realized that none of these elements existed. What a pity. I was looking so forward to Faith's new work but what i got was a remix of some R&B/gospel work. The producers did a horrible job in remixing this album such that each song blended into the previous one and the mood remained considerably somber while listening to the music. What happened to songs like ""It matters to me"" or ""The way you love me"". This is what works and has attracted your fans to concerts. Love your voice faith, but some things should stay status quo."
2,"If I'd wanted this type of music, I'd buy Celine......","I eagerly haved looked forward to each & every Faith Hill album. Her early work helped spur me to make major changes in my life!!! I continue to play her previous albums all the time.This album, although incredible if you like loud, pounding, strong music, is NOT my idea of Faith Hill at her best. She has slowly, but surely, moved from her roots & has put out a product that her original fans will not relate to. With this album, her producers seem to want to attract a new audience. Unfortunately, they'll lose the very fans who helped her get to where she is today.If her goal is to attract new fans with a new genre of music, please include some songs for us ""old timers"" along with the new ones. The last cut of the album is beautiful & is Faith at her best! At least we have that!"
3,Lame Background Music-NOT COUNTRY,"Faith Hill will always have a beautiful voice. This CD shows her vocal talents, but a lot of the songs stink! The rhythms are awkward with strange synthetic sounds, and weird choir backup singers in a few of the songs. The first single, Cry is great, but this CD is certainly not like her spunky country albums of the past. If This Is The End is similar to past song styles, a romantic ballad similar to her hit from Pearl Harbor. This Is Me is a cute song, but rather pointless. Most of the lyrics talk of heartbreak, which could be relatively depressing if you are in a good mood! The CD is about an hour long which is nice too, but if you're looking for a good country CD this isn't it and it's not really a good attempt at going pop either."
4,"Good CD...Pop sound, defintely not Country","I like Faith Hill's music and this CD is good for the most part. It is mostly ballads/slower songs but it is different than any other CD she has produced. If you are looking for country, this is certainly not it. I wouldn't even put it in a contemporary country category...it is very much pop/easy listening like Celine Dion. The title song that she just realeased, ""Cry"", is as close to country as it gets in relation to the whole CD. If you liked the album ""Breathe"" better than any of her earlier albums, then you will like this CD. There is no steel guitar, no fiddle, no twang. Some of the songs almost sound like a light jazz. So...if you are diehard country...forget it. But if you like her music over the past 3-4 years, then you will not be disappointed because this is a further step in that same direction. To put it in Loretta Lynn's words, ""They pushed her pop""."
4,"Beautiful, Mature Music","Faith Hill's newest album ""Cry"" demonstrates a major step forward. Faith Hill shows a new level of maturity both musically and personally. Each song may not be as country as some traditionalist would like. However, the Faith Hill we all know and have loved from the start is still alive and well in this CD. She has reached new heights vocally which are coupled with very beautiful lyrics and music. I highly recommend this album to the music lover who is looking for more than the cookie cutter stuff that has covered the airways of late. Two thumbs up!!!"
3,Faith performs amazing vocals on mostly average material,"The first four songs on this album are outstanding. However, if you are a devout country fan, you may not agree with this assessment. This is the least ""country"" of Faith's albums to date. If you can appreciate diverse forms of music, then you should be able to appreciate the wide range of influences that Faith brought to her latest project. Faith's vocals on all of these songs are nothing less than superb. Unfortunately, most of the material fails to reach out and grab you. If you are a fan of Faith, you should enjoy this album nonetheless. However, if you haven't purchased a Faith Hill CD before, I would recommend Breathe and Faith to begin with."
2,Unfaithfully disappointed,"I guess I am just too big a country fan..if I had listened to some clips of the songs on this CD before hand, I wouldn't have bought it. It is VERY adult, contemporary and with the exception of ""Cry"", all of the songs sound the same. I still love Faith...but I am already anticipating her next CD with hopefully less orchestra and extras and more Faith."
5,better than shania,I've been a fan of hers since wild one - each album sounded better - the vocals are strong and the songs rock - when compared to shania - faith has songs with meaning - where shania has 18 songs that all sound like a female def leppard.I had to listen to the album a few times to really appreciate it. The first time you listen you wonder - whats up with this - it aint country - but it gets better with each listen.
1,Just bad,"I love Faith. I will always love Faith. If not for her music for the person she is. I'm disappointed in her latest album. I don't know what less to say but it's just not good. The songs are strange. Where did she get these song writers from? They don't flow at all. And the producers basically shot the dying horse in the head with all the loud background singing and instruments. Faith's voice is beautiful but she just sounds bored on this album. She needs to take some time off and remember why she got in this business in the first place. And she also needs to admit that this is not a country album. This album is 110% NOT country. She needs to be very careful now. LeAnn Rimes went pop and nobody bought her album. Her fans and peers turned their backs on her. If Faith doesn't get her butt back in the cowboy boots she might find herself on VH1's ""Where Are They Now?"""
1,Disappointing,"This cd is a really big let down. It doesn't matter to me that it's not country...the problem is that it doesn't have any depth or feeling. The qualities that made Faith Hill Faith Hill are not in evidence. The emotion and realness have been replaced by slick production, questionable musical arrangements, embarrassing lyrics, and a plastic persona. I think Faith Hill is one of the most talented singers around and quite possibly one of the most beautiful women in the world but I think that what many people related to about her was how real, warm, talented, and beautiful she was and how real her songs were. There are songs on each of her first three albums that I have played repeatedly for years and they can still touch my emotions. I'm disappointed that Faith thinks that by branching out she has to completley change everything about herself and her music."
4,Faith Hill/ CRY,"Originally bought this CD because I heard ""One"" on the radio. Never really listened to her music before. I was pleasantly surprised. I particularly love ""Unsaveable"" and ""Free"", about marital breakups; as well as ""One"" and ""Cry"". But the whole CD offers thoughts on all stages of relationships with very personal lyrics that will strike a chord. Faith has a new fan!"
3,not the same faith hill,"Overall, it's average. I have been a fan ever since the beginning and this one is geared too much toward the MTV/VH1 groupies. The old Faith is reminiscent in ""When the lights go down,"" with it's soulful riffs. With everyone in the music industy selling out, this cd is not surprising."
3,The Original is MUCH BETTER!,"Nothing against Faith Hill, she is an excellent singer, but once again a truly talented singer songwriter is overshadowed by someone more famous doing a cover of their song. ""Cry"" was written by Angie Aparo (male) and can be found on ""The American"" You might recognize his song ""Spaceship"" If you like the F.Hill version please checkout the original artist. I'm still hoping for a follow up to The American. Just remember, in many cases Diva=Thief."
1,No Faith,"Faith, Faith, Faith - what are you doing?? I can't believe you are trying to do so much R&B. You are not an R&B singer, you are a country singer. I would not recommend this album. She needs to go back to her roots. I think she is trying too hard to sell albums, and it is very apparent by this mess of an album. Don't waste your money."
5,Remarkable,"I loved the disc! It was much better than her last one, and she's deffinitely gotten (even) better."
1,In a word - Disappointing,"I knew it would simply not matter what Faith Hill put out, some folks were going to sing her praises regardless of the result.But let's ""call a spade a spade"" - the CD is a disappointment and will not be well-received by the majority of her fans. It is simply an exercise in self-absorbtion.What was she doing when she recorded this, singing to herself in the mirror?Bottom line is I would have cancelled my pre-order with Amazon.com if I had known the CD was this bad."
5,worth the wait,"hey all-if you are debating whether to buy ""cry"" - don't. this is a wonderful album with a variey of music on it. who likes just one kind anyway? you can listen to it anytime - no matter what kind of mood you are in. sad - she does sad. empowering - that too. i sometimes even work out to it. the cd just puts me in a good mood. maybe that is because i am a huge fan and really like her as an artist. i'm not sure, but i'd give it a whirl.i honestly don't think you'll be disappointed!my favorite sone - #13 - ""i think i will"" (best one for the gym)"
3,"Good, but not as good....","While i do enjoy the new CD greatly, i was a bit disappointed in the fact that it focuses less on a country background and more on a soul kind of background. Cry is a new look for Faith, and while the CD is a success in terms of what she is trying to accomplish with it, i hope that future CD's tend to stay a little closer to the country roots that we're used to."
5,Gotta Love Faith from Hemet,Faith has come a long way. This is a fantastic CD. She tells it like it is. Real life stuff. She sings not only country buy rhythem and soul.
4,Fan of Faith's and Tim's,"I love the songs Cry and When The Lights Went down.Yes, the sound and music has changed. I can understand thechange. You have to see what your fans are hungry for . I stilllove the old sound the best. Im still hanging with you and Tim.Fans if you dont have this CD ""Cry"" and Tim's new one ""TimMcGraw and The DanceHall Doctors, What are you waitin for??Get on ur shoes , get in ur car and race to ... and get them.You will play them all the time. I do. Faith & Tim, what can Isay--I am a HUGE fan of yours, love you both alot. Admire yallKEEP IT GOIN ON !!!"
3,Faith's Album,Faith's latest albums isn't to bad. All though I couldn't get to download the enhanced video verison on it. I had someone else down load it for me and they even couldn't down load the enhanced video on it on the computer. I do agreee that it doesn't sound like coutnry though but I still like Faith Hill though. She is a nice person. She does put on a good concert though with her songs. Once you get to know Faith Hill from outside of her songs she is a really nice person.
2,Faith Hill- Cry,Sorry Faith not your best work. I particulary dont like this one.The cross-over was not for you. Keep it Country
2,More challenging songs than before; uninspired delivery,"I have followed Faith mostly out of curiosity that she has achieved such celebrity status; and looked forward to this CD to see where she would go next.Faith has created an large fan base by successfully singing accessible songs and projecting an loveable image that has won over a lot of hearts. With this album she attempts more challenging material, but doesn't bring to it the vocal skill, emotional depth, or inspired delivery to bring these songs to life.If you love Faith, the celebrity, you will revel in this next chapter in her career. If you are looking for artistry, you'd be best to look elsewhere."
2,Dissappointed,"Sadly, I was very dissappointed with Faith Hill's new cd. There is not an ounce of country on this album, and it's just nothing special. Not that I'm not a fan of hip hop, but her country style was just more original and the hip hop thing is just overdone. Personally, i think she was much better and more successful at the mainstream-but-still-country act, and now she's really ""crossed over,"" but her hip hop music isn't even that great or catchy. Compared to her past 2 cd's, this one is a real dissapointment."
2,One word sums up this album,"When i heard the lead of single ""Cry"" i was excited about buying this album.The songs on this cd sounds as if they were written by two year olds.Trust me its that bad.There are about three half way descent songs on here.Cry,When the Lights go Down,You Belong.The rest are horrid.I too cringed when i listened to this.I still dont know how she could actually listen to the finished tracks,and think these were the best."
1,What a disappointment,"I have very broad taste in music, however I have to say that I am very disappointed in Faith Hill's latest CD. Given the very mixed reviews, I thought I'd buy it and see for myself. Unfortunately, she and her producers seem to be focusing on maximizing CD sales and getting radio play on pop stations. ""Breathe"" was okay and had clever songs that felt accessible. ""Cry"" feels as if she has completely lost her unique qualities and joined the other pop divas, whose CD's I assiduously avoid. I don't like overwrought, over-produced music, and that's what ""Cry"" sounds like. Instead of being adventurous and gutsy as some other reviewers have stated, this CD comes across as blatantly commercial. Faith can't quite seem to figure out what style she's trying to assume on this CD and it's a major disappointment from a very talented woman. I recommend she fire her producers, be content with the money she already has and make some music that sounds at least vaguely sincere."
2,Faith Hill- CRY,This is definately not your best work Faith. Why did you cross over. Country music rules....
1,poor excuse for country,"I guess if this crap had been released as pop, it MAY have been worth listening to. As it is, it is terrible ""no man's land"" garbage that is an insult to country purists. I don't feel she has ANY talent, unless you just like looking at her. Her vocals are lousy and the songs are boooring (snooze, snooze). Good luck if you buy this one!"
2,NOT Country,"This CD should be in the Pop or Hip Hop catagory. If you like that type of music you will like it, but don't expect a country CD. I was very dissapointed in it."
1,nothing big,still cant believe this cd went to number one this cd sucks big timei got this cd in was so happy i hear it in it just sucks i only like the song ''cry'' and ''one'' but other songs suck plz dont get this cd just dont this cd just ant worth the money
1,The title is accurate at least,"Faith Hill does for music what Marlon Brando does for SLimFast......exactly. Faith Hill is a joke that has worn out it's welcome. Everyone claims she's gone from country to pop, rock, rap whatever. She has done none of this. How can you have a style when you have no entertainment value? Her songs are written for her; the production is over the top, trying to push a product that is nothing more than fluff, and the studio magic can still only make her nothing more than a mediocre singer who shouldn't be singing in the first place. Faith's voice would be much more suited for intercoms as she asks ""Would you like to supersize that?""Just another example of commercialized, pre-fabricated, fast-food music that will be forgotten as quickly as it took to make it in the first place."
2,Too biased to finish,"I felt this book had too much of a lean toward childbirth without anesthetic (among other biases) to bother finishing. However, I did feel the lists at the beginning of the book were helpful in deciding what things are necessities and when. As a new mom, we might get caught up in all the fancy products on the market we see in the magazines and it is nice to know there is a resource out there discussing what are needs and what are merely wants."
2,not really new,"I think that there are other books that are better guides to decorating. Mary Gilliat herself put together a better book than this one called Mary Gilliat's Interior Design Course.Pluses:There are some good descriptions of paint techniques and window treatments.Minuses:False advertising-The photos are outdated.Recommendation:Buy her other book or another decorating guide.Better Sources:1000 Practical Ideas for Home Decoration, Decorating your First Apartment, or the Art of Interior Design by Woloszynska"
2,Not that funny,"There are some gems in here, but not enough. The letter written by Groucho Marx is great, you can hear his voice in it. About two-thirds of the way through I got tired of wading through the muck to get to laugh-producing material, and gave up. I understand that this is not a joke book, but I just thought it would be funnier."
1,Not for me.,"Could not find a way to finish this. This was a book club selection, and just not my cup of hemlock."
3,Not what I expected,"This is the first Kathleen Norris book I've read, so my expectations were based on heresay from friends in Divinity school and other intelligent folk. But, based on the hype, I was expecting something revolutionary, inspiring, that would make me think. I forced myself to finish the book, and I'm glad that I did, because overall my impression improved. But I found the book very very slow (which is something I've heard many comment about others of her books). It would be best to read it a little at a time, don't plan to read it over the course of a week - take at least a month. There were some REALLY good chapters - I have them marked in mine, if you'd like a heads-up."
2,More spirit than geography,"When I read this book my expectations were high and remained on that level for the first 20 pages. After that I realized this book is less a realistic description of what life in the plains is like but appears to be the authors personal point of view on religion. She mixes up subjective opinions, religious terms and a pseudo-sophisticated, yet more symbolic language that destroys any kind of pleasure that one might find reading this. The description of harsh climate, life in lonesome, empty spaces is realistic but its nothing innovative that one wouldnt know about without reading this book. I think this opus might be interesting to read for everyone living in rural Dakota but to everyone else it is nothing but a mix of bible quotes, simple facts and personal experience as to be found in every issue of National Geographic (except the religious part...)."
5,"Dakota, a Spiritual Geography","The book did an amazing job of relating the people to the land in which they live. The harshness, lonliness and beauty of land shaping the people who spend years within the Plains were told with clarity and poetry in prose."
2,Missed for me,"While I thought the author had a nice handle on the English language her over-riding theme seemed to be a comparison of life on the Plains with Benedectine Monks. Knowing little about these monks, I felt like most of the book missed me."
5,A thoughtful meditation on living in rural America.,"A brilliant reflection on life in the Dakotas--must reading for anybody who romanticizes country living and wants the real scoop--the good, the bad, and the philosophical. Norris is one who finds her quiet, small-town, monklike existence conducive to the meditative labor of writing, and the quality of her book proves that she's hit on a lifestyle that clearly works for her. As one who's lived in a small town but found its cultural gene pool far too shallow, I throught Norris' analysis was exactly correct, and yet I could also understand how she could choose that life for herself, just as I decided it was not for me"
4,Understanding how the Northern Plains shaped a culture,"Read this book while planning a trip to N. Dakota. In a captivating and readable style Ms. Norris gives insight into how the climate, isolation, and topography of the northern plains created a unique culture. The essays are told from the perspective of a participant in the culture, removed by one generation. As she returns ""home"" she learns the assets and liabilities of her ancestors' neighborhood. This book really helped me to see ND as more than a cold, flat, empty space"
4,Spiritual in the mundane,Kathleen Norris finds the spiritual where one never looks. Very inspirational. Interested readers should also try the Cloister Walk by Ms. Norris
3,Love it or Leave It,"This book is a patchwork of writings, many previously published, inviting us to visit the plains of North America. Many of the pieces effectively transport you there -- to small towns set apart under the big sky, remote enough to challenge our cultural concepts. Others are more personal, taking you on the author's ""spiritual journey,"" and in these you meet Kathleen Norris the seeker. I'm not sure if it all came together as she intended. I learned things I didn't know about the sparsely settled plains states of our country. If you also want to explore some inner territory, you might like this book."
4,Recommended offline reading...,"Strange Horizons is recognized as a professional publication by the Science Fiction Writers of America. It has an extensive readership, and I'm a regular reader. It's nice to be able to read it on the web, but it's doubly nice to have a printed volume to lend to friends who don't read magazines online. I'd call this selection of stories from their pages uneven (I'm not much for sf poetry) but overall entertaining and a great insight into the very newest writing in short science fiction and fantasy. I woke this morning with this entire review in my head, so Strange Horizons must have made a good impression on me,"
1,Mediocre at best,"Mediocre writing at best, mostly in need of editing, or better writers. Not worth the price"
1,Bait and Switch,"The cover art is taken from work done by the late (At least I think he is dead.) and arguably the best of all the Superman artists, Curt Swan. Unless you count Murphy Anderson whom I understand inked Swan's work. The two were often refered to as, ""Swanderson"".At first blush. the cover art is almost enough to get you to buy it but then you think, ""Wait a minute, I have seen all the classic Superman cartoons"". Apparently this is just another attempt to package these classic cartoons with the up dated cover art.Don't get me wrong. The original Superman cartoons were absolutely great ! I watched them as a child on tv and loved them, I was beside myself when I was able to purchase them on VHS about ten tears ago.By all means get the original Superman cartoons. (All sixteen of them.) Just don't expect this particular offfering to be anything new or different.Course the cover art IS by Curt Swan,,,"
1,Highly disappointed,"Previously purchased this item & was excellent. This time, however, chocolate chips hard as a rock, therefore, must find a different product.Enjoy Life Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, Gluten, Dairy & Soy Free, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)"
4,A Master at Work,"Ranglin's roots are in reggae, and Gotcha! has much more of a reggae feel to it than does his recording Old Solutions, which features more of a an African/World Music sound. However, Gotcha! is not really a reggae recording, it is a jazz recording with reggae at its core. Ranglin is a master at weaving his guitar around a melody, never seeming to be trying to impress, but always impressing with his inventiveness and exquisite sense of timing. It goes without saying that the engineering is first-rate, making this a disk that is highly recommendable both musically and sonically."
5,Perfect,"We selected these for our wedding registry. My husband's nickname is monkey, so we had a whole theme going. These salt shakers are adorable in person. A cute little magnet sticks them together so they ""kiss."" We love these."
4,good,The best song is NOT by van morrison BUT by Little Steven. Time of your life is AWESOME and can't find anywhere other than this soundtrack!!!! He makes the whole soundtrack!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Save Your Money,This was a total waste of time and money. The song at the end of the movie wasn't on this CD so basically what you get is elevator music.
2,"I was Foolish to not read ""REVIEWS""","Had I known my most favorate song ""Van Morrison's wasn'tthere I never would have purchased this ""Just okay"" soundtrack. And three of the tracks all sound similar.I only have myself to blame."
5,Nine Months picture soundtrack,"Bought this cd for the song this is the time of your life by Little Steven, great song, great performer great in every way.Other songs are also okay!"
4,Good to see the old Randy Travis Back,"The lyrics in this album are a little preachy. I understand it is gospel. However, the whole album is almost trying to get you to find Jesus or else. However, I do have to say I have always like his music and I admire him for not writing and singing songs just because they are catchy or what people want to hear. I really liked the music. It was inventive and full of the kind of country tunes I like to hear. Randy Travis sticks to ""old country"" by reminding me of people like Hank Williams, George Jones, and Johnny Cash. Good for him."
1,Not For Everybody,"I'm glad that so many other people seem to have enjoyed this CD. I really liked the radio hit ""Three Wooden Crosses,"" and bought the CD because of that song. However, I was very put off by the album, which really grated against my religious sensibilities at some points.Speaking for myself, I much prefer to listen to Johnny Cash's religious songs, which seem to me to embody a much deeper understanding of Scripture.However, to be fair, we all experience the Holy Spirit in different ways, and what seems shallow to some may appear deep to others, and vice versa."
5,Randy hits Gospel Gold again,"This is another great album from Randy Travis. While I prefer the originality of his first Gospel album, this one has gems of its own to thrill you with.It features a mixture of heartfelt story songs with hard hitiing message songs. Another creative success from a supposedly ""washed up"" performer.This is the type of album people live for. Something different from the cookie-cutter nonsense that Nashville likes to shove around."
1,In a word...YUCK!,"Okay, I know it sugar free, but does that mean it also has to be flavor free? A gingerbread cake is the perfect place to load it up on great spices so it has lots of flavor. Needless to say, they didn't and this ended up being a rubbery flavor-free cake."
2,Not what I expected.,I ordered a 1m optical cable got a 2m. Really wanted only 1m. The cable itself was the thinnest I'd ever seen. Seemed to have almost no outer insulation and as a result seems fragile. Time will tell. It was cheap and was delivered on-time.
3,Not bad at all,"Like the reader from Dallas, I don't read romance, but a friend at work had a copy and I needed something to occupy my lunch hours.The story is classic formula romance, but I found myself enjoying it and rooting for the heroine and her fella.There were plenty of sub-plots to fill in the gaps and the love scenes are pretty spicy.All in all, not a bad way to spend a few lunch hours."
4,Great romance with non-traditional heroine,"This romance pleasantly surprised me. I found myself enjoying it much more than I expected. What I enjoyed the most were the different from typical romance hero and heroine. Jenny was not the usual beautiful innocent girl that you generally find in most romances. She was plain, disabled, emotionally and physically scared by her past. I felt this made her a deeper character; I felt a connection with her I don't normally feel towards romance heroines. You will really root for her on her path to happiness.Luke was not traditional either in the sense that he actually started the novel as a ""bad guy"". He and his brothers rob for the fun of it and keep the money for themselves; he wasn't the typical good guy in a bad guy disguise. It was interesting to watch his progress from somewhat bad guy to mostly good guy.The supporting characters are great as well. This is just a great overall romance with strong plot and a strong cast of characters. Highly Recommended!"
2,Wrong title on book,"2/3 of this book is a general introduction to .NET, including ADO.NET. The rest of the book is an introduction to SQL Server, Oracle, DB2 and MySQL. As such it's a fairly good book, you will learn the basics of how to use .NET together with the major databases, but where is the highly scalable database application I wanted to read about? I already know .NET and database so I expected an interesting book about the subject promised by the title but that part is completely missing. Strange, why choose a title that doesn't describe the book?"
2,The title of the book is very misleading!,"Most of the book is spent giving an over view of .NET and general methods of connecting to DB's. I would have thought anybody wanting to read a book on 'Building Highly Scalable DB's"" would already know this basic stuff.As a basic introduction to writing DB applications in .NET then it's okay, plain and simple.Glad I borrowed a colleagues copy!"
2,not sure about it,I don't think it did anything more thant just regular Vitamin E would do. It forms a film over the skin but I don't think it helps heal better/faster.
5,Scar is nearly gone,Been using this product for 6 weeks and my scar is barely noticable. Good stuff. It works! I highly recommend this product.
5,Be Patient,"I had surgery to lift my eyebrows with the incisions right above the eyebrow. I used this stuff for 90 days and saw fairly good results. However, a couple of months later, the improvement was significant and within a few months the scar was hardly noticeable. It does not work overnight but the end results are very good."
4,People Who Say It Is Sticky and Never Dries Are Using Too Much Product!,"It says clearly in the instructions to apply a very thin layer, and if it does not dry after 4 minutes, wipe off the excess. The instructions also note that treatment may take up to 3 months for fresh scars and longer for old scars (they say to continue treating old scars for up to 6 months if you notice improvement after 3 months). My surgeon gave me a sample of this and I swear by it. The scar from the incision is noticeably smoother, less red and less tight/itchy/uncomfortable after treating for only a week. After the Kelo Cote dries, it forms a flexible, waterproof skin over the scar and I can wash my hands, put lotion or compression wrap on it without the skin being damaged (when I used bandages and Neosporin, every time I washed my hands, the skin got wet and macerated and damaged, even with ""waterproof"" bandages)."
3,Kelo-cote scar gel @ Amazon,"I've have used it for about 2 weeks, not major improvements yet. I like it but think it's too expensive for what it does. I assume it has to be used for longer period of time. If you had surgery or any procedure, I'd recommend bigger size or scar guard instead."
4,scar formula,"I think it really does help reduce raised, red scars - if you use it regularly, which I have a hard time doing. Still even the way I use it, it has helped somewhat in making my scar softer and less red."
3,Jury Still Out,"Although I have been using this product for over a month, I have not noticed any visible differences. I am still waiting for some improvement."
3,Sticky,I REALLY don't like how it dries. It dries like a sticky adhesive. My shirts will get caught on it and collect fuzz and lint from my clothing.
2,No improvement noted.,No improvement noted. I used the entire tube as directed and didn't notice any change from my before pictures.
4,Works Great!!!,I used this product on a cut that I had due to surgery and their is barely a scar and it did not raise at all.I would recommend this to everyone that is trying to keep their scarring down to a minimum.
1,Not much help--incomplete instructions on full use and removal,This product came highly recommended. It does not come with any instructions on how to remove it gently so as to apply a new layer after it has been on the skin overnight. I did not notice that the scars were helped much either and I was using it at the early stage of scar formation so it should have been more effective. Be careful using it around skin that is around the nose or tending to have any acne as it will make it worse. I bought this after trying the Dermatix which also did not work well for me and caused inflammation.
5,Very Happy,. It is a wonderful product. It is just as picture! I am very very pleased with this purchase. Thanks !
1,not really working,"I have tried this product until I finished the whole tube, but i can't see a difference on my scar. not sure if its working."
4,good,I only had face surgery nine weeks ago and I have been using this product since I had the stitches taken out. I have to use it longer to give it a better review. Plastic surgeon was the one who recommended it. I also use vitamin E oil. Don't know if it was the scar cream or the vitamin E oil that is giving me good results.
1,no change in scar,"I tried this product on the advise of a doctor. I've used Kelo-cote for 2 months now and see no change in the several scars of different severity and age that I've used it on. Maybe it needs longer to work, but I received the results I expected ... nothing."
1,"LIARS, CHEATERS & THIEVES!!!","THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT, BUT, DO NOT ORDER IT FROM THIS COMPANY. THE PRODUCT PAGE SAID THE AMOUNT WAS FOR 2 TUBES. WHEN I FINALLY RECEIVED THE ONE TUBE AND CONTACTED THE COMPANY, THEY SAID ""THEY WOULD GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY...""...IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS AND MANY E-MAILS LATER AND STILL NO PRODUCT!!!"
1,"Oily, Messy and Can't See A Difference","I had a breast lift about 3 months ago. At the request of my Doc, I have been using Kelo-Cote since about 10 days after my surgery. Not only is it VERY oily (and yet still hard to spread) I don't notice any difference at all. In fact, we did Kelo-Cote shots as well, and I swear my scars look worse now. I developed red vein-y things immediatly after each set of shots (there were 2). I am continuing to use this simply because the Doc said so. I actually have way more luck with ScarZone - which is an immediate fix. The white cream of ScarZone (as opposed to kelo-Cote's clear/yellow-ish oil) masks the redness of the scars after it sinks in. I feel like this is only a temp fix, because the scar has absorbed the white cream, but at least it makes the scars look better for 2 days, whereas I cannot tell a difference (or possibly a worse effect) with Kelo-Cote yet."
4,Light weight,"I just bought this cd, had to have imported from england on a different website. I got the two cd set, and I like it, hence the reason for the 4 stars, but this is by far not anywhere as good as John B. can do. It does not have a lot of bass to it, and at times, lacks flow, and as for the ay caramba track, well the name sums it up perfectly. I thought that the vocals were forced, and that mixing on it could have been done better by a 12 year old. His music really is that good though on the rest of the tracks and I like a lot of his vocals, but not his best work and I do love this guy saw him live in houston, even though he ended his set early with red one, cant complain cause it was really good. Overall buy it, and skip ay caramba, very chill drum and bass with some really banging moments. Hope it helps. Up all night."
3,Average Manual,Nothing great. I've use better shop manual. OK for general knowledge and repairs. Look for a corvair restoration book that's more detailed
4,No fat between the ears,"I gotta admit, I put the book one the shelf for a month after I received it. After all, I'm not a fat woman and that's the target audience, right? Wrong! (about the target audience). This turned out to be a delightful book. It is a must read for anyone with a sense of humor no matter if you're fat, thin, male, female, whatever! Pepper has taken the time to encourage people to ""draw outside the lines"". She points out the often overlooked fact that it's style that counts, not what your scale says. I like the fact that she is so damn comfortable with herself and if and when she loses weight (which she is doing right now) it will be because SHE wants to and not because anyone else thinks she should. This book is a celebration, not of being fat, but of being valuable, eccentric, intelligent, and funny no matter what the package!"
3,Humor from the frozen north,"Very witty and incisive or insightful. Pepper was married to my brother-in-law Chuck. He's a guy who took an early out from the USAF and liked Alaska enough to stay up there (I think that monthly allotmt from the state's oil revenue enticed him to stay up there instead of returning to Levittown,NY his boyhood home).I hope Pepper writes other books. I was of course saddened when she divorced Chuck. He has as far as I'm aware remarried and hopefully has some sort of job security.Pepper had a step-daughter, Katie (Chuck's daughter from first wife). No one in the family really knows where Katie is these days but hopefully one day she too will enjoy this humorous little book."
1,Not a book - a pamphlet,"Unless you know absolutely nothing about this subject, do not buy this pamphlet. The authors repeat information that is widely available in other, more comprehensive sources. Waste of time and money."
5,Perfect Bathroom Book,"When I saw this, I said to myself, ""Just what the world needs...another 101 Things book. Is there any innovation and originality left in the publishing industry? Does anyone take risks or push the envelope anymore?""However, as these things go, this is a fun and well-written entry in the tired and lazy 101 Things genre. It has oddball facts/info and offbeat humor. I laughed aloud more than once at the writer's observations and turns of phrase.It's also the perfect bathroom book. The 101 points make for frequent breaks, and you can chuckle through as many as it takes for you to do your business.A cut above the usual man-hating, cat-loving 101 drivel out there. Take it into the john and have a big laugh."
4,Great Read but Flimsy Book,"This book is a great read. It has a lot of interesting information about the Mafia, and provides a good lense to look at other parts of history from the perspective of the mafia.I just wish they had put more into the construction of the book. This book has never left my home, and yet several pages began falling out soon after I bought it. Reading it soon became a balancing act."
3,May not be worth it.,"Personally, I've amassed a large collection of Mafia-related texts over the years and not much in this book was surprising. Of course, like anyone else, I didn't know everything in this book, but there are also a lot of word-for-word repeats. I'd say this is a beginners crash-course book."
3,Ain't Gregory Peck !,"Good interpretaion, but too bad only AMC seems to have access to the original restored widescreen version of ""Captain Horatio Hormblower"" with Peck, Virgina Mayo, and James Robertson Justice. Would be nice if amazonia allowed us a way to record those whom are seeking that WB cinemascope costume drama on DVD."
5,The best gets better,This follow on to the earlier efforts of A&E are actually an improvement where few thought that possible. The widescreen format and the quality of the filming are superb. Forrester's work is excellently adopted to the big screen. With a large screen televison and surround sound this ranks as an all time favorite.
4,arrived on time,"The dvd'd arrived on time and as advertised. Have not watched them yet, but I have seen some on tv. Great series."
3,"Great films, not a great collection","Unless these are the last two films in the series you haven't seen, you would really do better to buy one of the other Hornblower box sets, such as ""Horatio Hornblower - The Complete Adventures."" This box set was put out in 1998 and is fairly dated compared to the other ones."
2,Dissapointed,"A longtime Hornblower fan, I could not wait for the ""Adventure Continues."" But when I saw it I could not wait for the adventure to finish! This series is dull and lackluster by comparison to the first four episodes (The Duel, The Fireships, The Duchess and the Devil, The Wrong War.) ""The Adventure Continues"" dissapointed me so that I did not even bother to see the complete ""The New Adventures"" series. I will have to give ""The New Adventures"" another try."
5,Horatio never disappoints,Buy it and play it over and over again! They just do not make movies of this quality anymore!Three cheers for the lad!
2,Hornblower was not a defiant jerk....,"As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is ""cool"" or a ""big man"". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a ""Question Authority"" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, ""cool"" is the same as ""cute""). Perhaps the other ones with this Ioan Gruffud are better, but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others."
3,"Entertaining, Aye, But Disappointing","Perhaps I was distracted while watching this the first time 'round. Maybe I'll give it another go. That said, I wasn't enthusiastic about this second installment of ""Hornblower."" It seems a bit weak when compared to the first episodes. While all the characters were well cast, the plotline isn't as spry and doesn't move with the same quick tempo. A&E might have picked a better story from the treasure trove of C.S. Forester's series.Furthermore, there is little to suggest that our hero Horatio has developed as a character since we last saw him on the quarterdeck with Captain Pellew. And speaking of Pellew, A&E's scant use of him (portrayed brilliantly by Robert Lindsay) is woeful.Then again, any Hornblower installment these days is a breath of fresh air in the television void -- so enjoy it for what it is. Meanwhile, we shall all eagerly await the next installment, which we hope won't be too long in coming. Reef the mainsails, you rascals!"
1,Hate It,"I absolutely hate this textbook. It lacks color, so it's a very boring read, and the information is scattered. Also, a lot of the example problems do not relate to the problems at the end of the chapter. If your preferred method of learning is self-teaching through textbooks, you may want to avoid this one."
3,air pollution control eng.,"the book is in decent condition as described but i ordered it at the beginning of january and now its the middle of march and i just got it but it did day it could take ""up to 3 months"".. and it pretty much did"
2,You have to be a real fan to enjoy this.,"Don't get me wrong here, I'm one of the biggest Capstick fans there is but what I've seen from him is this: He either writes a nail biting account of personal or researched adventures or he rambles on about some boring life chronology spiced up by only a few tidbits of adventure or peril. Thats the way parts of Silent Places is and thats how this book is. If you are a fan of John Taylor or are interested in getting a history lesson of the everyday life of someone like him, then you'll probably enjoy this book.Me, I'm a fan of the man who writes about the true life (or not)near death experiences of Corbett, Patterson, and himself in exotic bush locations in a time long since forgotten.I knew what I was getting into when I bought this book but, hey, it's a Capstick book and I have to read 'em all. It's not a terrible book but it's definitely not Long Grass or Dark Continent."
2,A man called Lion,"I have enjoyed Capstick other stories in the past, but this one bored me to tears. It is nought but a rehash of ""Pondoro"" with some extra information from casual acquaintances of the Irish writer/hunter. The fact that Taylor was a homosexual didn't deserve chapter after chapter since, despite Capstick's analysis, his more serious failings were a total disregard for the Law and an inability to hold on to his pennies. That brought about his downfall, not his preference for the same sex. John Taylor deserved a better epitaph than this book."
3,Good Book about a Strange Man.,"AFTER YOU START READING THIS BOOK YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE DEEP DEVOTION THIS MAN HAS FOR AFRICA, THIS STORY IS VERY INTERESTING, SOMETIMES FUNNY AND IN THE END KINDA SAD. JOHN TAYLOR HAD A GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF GUNS AND CALIBURS AND WAS WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER IN TODAYS TIMES AN UNETHICAL HUNTER. THIS STORY IS FROM A DIFFIRENT TIME AND A DIFFIRENT AFRICA, A GOOD ADDITION TO YOUR CAPSTICK COLLECTION."
3,Not the best,"Not one of Capstick's best books. But really, I found I didn't particularly like the fellow the book was about, so may have kicked my negativity up concerning the book."
3,Front Wheel Did Not Fit Into Forks? Returned it!,"This bike is very similar to others in the price range available from Target and other retailers. The front wheel did not fit into the forks, so I had to return it. Forks opening was too narrow. Also, all these bike from PRC smell of rubber and chemicals for weeks and sometimes months after assembly."
1,Bike is defective,"We ordered this bike twice & both times it was impossible to assemble because the pedals can not be attached to the bike (they are the wrong size). Unless, this defect is fixed I recommend you do not purchase this bike. It was an attractive bike & appeared to be good value for the money- but if you can't pedal, what good is it?"
5,Nobel Prize Worthy For Sure,"I'm not going to go into great detail here since so many other gracious readers have already done so. What I will say is that this book has truly saved my life. Seriously. After 15 years of misdiagnoses,one great doctor suggested amalgam illness, I then found this gem of a book, and now I am finally on the road to recovering from this nightmare. This book is the be all and end all of mercury poisoning recovery and, at times, the author's razor sharp wit will give you a much needed laugh. Yes, this book is science heavy, but the tone is not. Andy has penned this in such a way that is very personal and very comforting. To call Andy Cutler a hero is not excessive in the least."
5,Excellent resource,"Even though his book could be more organized, I give Dr. Cutler five stars for his content. I have owned the book for over four years and keep referencing it over and over. It outlines a conservative and safe protocol for mercury/heavy metal detoxification."
1,Poorly written,"I have mercury poisoning and hoped this book would shed more light on this condition. While the book is packed with information, I was absolutely appalled by the author's immature, judgemental writing style. It makes me question the credibility of some of this information - which is a shame because there's no question that amalgam illness is real. I turned to this book duriing a very difficult time - the beginning of my detox treatment. And I was extremely disappointed with the professionalism of Cutler's approach. This book is in desparate need of a re-write and a re-price."
2,Better living through chemistry,"I bought this book because of the reviews but it has not been useful to me. Dr Cutler uses the chemical and doctor driven approach to detox. He derides natural agents like chlorella and cilantro and other methods like FIR saunas.The book is not easy to read or understand.I just bought Detoxify or Die by Sherry Rogers MD and it is way better written, clearer and much more pleasant to read. Now I think I will get some answers.Pam"
5,Floundering in the Dark,"I have found Andy's book ""Amalgam Illness"" invaluable, as I live in the Uk where there is no help available whatsoever. Andy's book is based on a myriad of people with this illness, the book has helped me on numerous ocassions make the right decisons rather than hurt myself further, also ensuring the right dental protocol is used, along with the importance of the right diet and supplements.My illness is ongoing at the moment, and Andy's advice is helping me every step of the way. I know the chelation section is the most important part to regain full health, I will be following this section very carefully.Thank-you Andy"
1,must have been written while still mercury toxic,"While I respect Dr. Cutler's opinion, this book is the most disorganized piece of writing I have ever seen, with many inconsistencies throughout the book. All of the information contained herein can readily be found free of charge, online, and in a much more organized, understandable fashion.I unfortunately purchased this book a few short years ago and felt it was overpriced at $30.00. Doubling the price of this haphazard, poorly bound book is highway robbery."
5,Scarecrow Pete,I read Scarecrow Pete by Mark Kimball Moulton. I liked it and I would recommend this book because the boy didn't find the scarecrow and that part was funny. In the book I read when the scarecrow said to come to him to meet him then the boy found the scarecrow and started to talk to him. This helped convince me that it was a good book.
3,"OK, but not a good tour book","I wanted a book for walking tours of NYC, but this book really didn't fit the bill. It doesn't have any pictures and the prose is hard to read and way too detailed."
4,Romance in Tasmania,"I truly love the way Candice Proctor writes historical romance. This book was very enjoyable, and realistic. It takes place in the 1840s in Tasmania in Australia. A wealthy English debutant (Jesmond aka ""Jessie"") and an Irish convict Lucas Gallgher who works as a groom and stable hand on her brother's estate where she resides with her family, fall for each other. He is serving out a life sentence with no way out. She is betrothed to a childhood friend. Can they find happily ever after?I do have to say however, after reading several Candice Proctor novels, I don't understand why she chooses most of her titles--they usually seem to have nothing to do with the storyline in mosts cases, but I rather have good plot and writing than catchy titles anyway.I would highly recommend this love story."
5,Another Masterpiece From Proctor,"This book is another brilliant and haunting romance from Candice Proctor.I'm an avid reader - from various genres, to literary fiction, to nonfiction. I can honestly say that I have rarely - outside of classic literature - encountered an author whose work stays with me the way Candice Proctor's does.After I finished this book, I immediately went back and re-read key passages. The characters stayed in my mind and in my heart.Much of Proctor's strength comes from the rich historical detail (she recreates a time and place so effectively that I almost feel as if I'm there). But even more important is her insight into the human condition. Her ability to explore the universal need for love and validation alongside of the brutalities of which man is capable makes her a real ""thinking"" person's romance author.She's a master of the genre."
3,Three Stars,"I've now come to the conclusion that CP is more of a general fiction writer than romance. I love a great love story that develops slowly, as it makes it more believable in the end, however, by three-quarters through, the leads did not share a kiss, an intimate touch, nothing.Even in their thoughts there was not much inner turmoil going on until the last half. In fact, I prferred Warrick's romance sub-plot over Lucas and Jesmond's.I gave the book three stars because of CP's excellent prose, the setting, and her creativity."
2,You get what you pay for,"It is true that these are very cushiony compared to other heal inserts, but at the same time, because they aren't just flat like Dr.Scholl's, the way the cushion comes to a more acute point on your heel can take some time to get used to. The main problems with these are that with me, they moved around a lot. I would have to re-adjust them throughout the day. And most importantly, within a day of using them, they had cracks in them and already started to wear down. I also bought two sets and they both wore down at exactly the same rate. More comfortable and more cushion than most, but if you intend to put them through their paces, they will break down on you."
1,good to junk,"Wow this heel went from awesome to junk the sad thing is the company doesn't care, don't bother with these."
2,Disappointed,I thought that I was getting an entire CD. This is only a single. The song is just OK. I could have done w/o it!
5,Size Does Not Matter,"What a wonderful book! Every day there is some fun excercise to help cure whatever spiritually ails you. Even though it is a small book, when you are through with the first 30 days, you can randomly pick a page every day after that and it never gets old. I cannot recommend this fun book enough."
5,Makes the best mocha latte ever!!!,I first bought a small bottle of syrup at a coffee shop in Germany that made an awesome mocha. I have an espresso machine at home and was looking for a way to make my own mocha latte. This syrup is great! It doesn't have that artificial flavor I find so unappealing in most flavorings I've found in the stores. It's not sickenly sweet either. Less than a teaspoonful will flavor a double shot latte. My friends think my Mocha latte's are better than Starbucks! You've got to try it!
5,Rapt attention,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Captivating Presence."" I am constantly behind in other reading I should do, but this book caught my rapt attention and held it. It touched me profoundly because it spoke simply and plainly of how all of life flows naturally and easily if and when our primary focus in on things of spirt rather than our attachments and blind spots."
2,Badly written,"My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys this book, and I'll admit that the illustrations are great, but I find the text of this book lacking. For example on page 40, the text reads: ""I'm supposed to be played with,"" he decided""--is this even correct grammar? The choppiness of the text, lack of flow, and overuse of exclamation points makes the story a disappointment to read."
2,Poorly written and incomplete,"The story is incomplete and confusing. There are considerable gaps without a parent, adult or smart kid adding additional explanations as the story goes along. If you haven't seen the film you would find yourself scratching your head. Shame on Pixar and Disney for allowing such a poorly written book to be published. If your kid doesn't read, the pictures, frames right out of the cartoon, are great. (The two stars are for the pictures.) But, where were the editors? Is the assumption that kids don't read anyway, so who's going to notice? Well anyway, here's to the illiterates: the one's who call themselves editors and the one's they are cultivating."
5,"Creepy, suspenseful score that is highly underrated","The score to Copycat blends so well with the movies themes(death, love, the connection between them) that I didn't think listening to it seprately would be as effective. I was wrong. This is one of the best of the 90's , a suspenseful, scary, chilling and moving score from Chris Young. He borrows a little from his earlier score in the year, Judical Consent, but what he does is expand his orginial ideas from that and create a newer, better work. There are some loud moments but these are genuinely scary and unexpected. If you like scores at all, you should check this one out."
4,Sound track of film COPYCAT.,"Item arrived in good condition. Although it's contents are not as I rememberd from the film, quite often the way with sound tracks. noddy"
3,romance as usual,"Other people's reviews gave me high hopes for this unfamiliar author. And I suppose she did better than many. If I'm going to read a Regency romance, I prefer some historical accuracy. I flinch when people immediately call each other by their first names. I call for hartshorn when ladies and gentlemen run around unchaperoned, even when, as in this case, the lady is a widow, not a maiden. Our heroine is interesting. Her family forced her at 17 into marriage with a rich merchant in his 60s, and she has just finished her year of mourning and gone to visit a childhood friend in London. The earl, on the other hand, is not so interesting. We are told he's a rake, and I am very very tired of heroes who are rakes. But he doesn't act like a rake--he acts like a man who lets his sisters boss him around. He never quite manages to have a personality, though we are assured that he is extremely good looking. I hope he doesn't bore the heroine to death. You can't just look at a guy forever."
1,Poorly put together,"The first one third of the short film is filled with senseless old WWII history, essentially filler to make up for the lack of Grenada footage. Not worth the purchase."
5,Strong and Delicate,"I love the WOLF-Garten Mini Rake. The tines are strong enough for me to rake around my plants, and flowers. They are also gentle enough to rake on my strubs to remove clippings. I was so worried the tines were going to be flimsy, but I opened my box and was very pleased."
5,Highly Reliable: marvelous tool; gets in small places a large rake cannot clean,This small hand rake is a great design at a reasonable price and is shipped promptly for immediate use; an instant joy.
1,Piece of JUNK,"6pk Golf Bag Cooler w/ 2 Free Ice PacksI used this item one time and the material tore apart, would like to get my money back if possible. Don't buy this, it should be labeled ""Disposable"""
1,Disappointing,"I love Kenny Loggins, but this was a mistake. Only one song I enjoyed, the rest were too commercial sounding...."
2,Somewhat Disappointed !!!,"This popcorn was not nearly as good as I expected. It was tough to chew, and loaded with significantly large sized hulls. I have tasted store bought popcorn superior to this product, and I would not purchase it again."
4,solid value for the price,"this hose reel was replacing a smaller (broken) plastic one in my shop so I was gratified for the heft of the steel case and reel. The hose was good quality rubber. No hose fittings were included and the assembly/ disassembly instructions are poor but for the price it is a good value (I looked at many before this purchase and unless you have a professional shop or vehicle with a need for a 2-500 dollar reel, this is a good choice)."
4,Not bad for a DIY,"I can't speak for the longevity of this (only been using it a week) but it seems decent. It has its minor issues (doesn't always latch and you have to pull/release it a few times to get it to catch) but it works great for home DIY'er like myself. I don't know that this would last long in a mechanic shop but for my needs it works great.Mounting was a pain, but if you are handy you will be able to find a way to do it. There is no hardware, so plan on picking up a few lags, depending on where you plan to mount it. And as others have stated, the hose to connect to your compressor is ridiculously short. I can't believe they though that was a reasonable length."
3,Well made but very hard to mount to wall,"The product seems to be solidly made and will probably serve me well for years. But, it's heavy and very hard to mount to a wall. The bolt holes on the mount are right behind the reel...makes it very hard to get a wrench on the lag screws. So, you have that dificulty while balancing a very heavy item that has a wheel that spins. If it weren't such a pain, it would be comical. So, my deduction in rating is only due to how you have to mount it to the wall. Otherwise, it seems to be an excellent product."
5,Great Book,My 3 year old grandson loves these Henry & Mudge books. He wants to read them over and over. He'll be getting more for Christmas.
4,It works!,"I bought this gum because it was so cute and funny, but it really works. After eating a couple handfuls of Shrimp Chips, and a few peices of dried squid my breath needed a little bit of help. This worked quick and with a punch, but not a punch that you taste, like with ice breakers, where it burns your nose while you're chewing. Infact you barely taste the mint, but wow can you smell it! Great product! Cute advertising!"
4,Outer Gateways: Worth Plowing Through,"This book reads like a mathematics text book. That being said, it is also an invaluable resource for Chaos magicians, practicioners of High Magick and followers of the left hand path. It delves into the numerology of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and it's relationship to Typhonian/Setian currents in history and religion. Grant uses Austin Osman Spare's books as a springboard for his ideas, and his admiration for both Spare and Crowley are obvious throughout. Although very difficult reading, the mind-blowing concepts and fascinating parallells drawn between fantasy and reality, magick and science and the past and the future make this book worth suffeing through for the serious and dedicated occultist."
1,Expecting a scary/suspensful story?? You WON'T find it here!,"Driving back and forth from Cleveland to Chicago, I use suspenseful Stephen King stories to pass the time and keep entertained. I purhased this CD thinking it was along those lines because that's how Amazon catagorized it....I was DEAD wrong. The stories in the collection were purely science fiction. There was no suspense or intrigue in any of the stories but merely strange tales of aliens and space ships all trying to give some deeper meaning that I couldn't begin to follow. I was extremely dissapointed. I kept thinking the stories would get better, but they only got worse. Eventually I gave up and threw the CD away. If boring science fiction stories aren't your thing...don't waste your money like I did."
3,Don't work as good without the caffine.,I have used Myrex for years with the caffine in them but they changed the formula and removed the caffine. They used to work much better than they do now. Might as well just buy Excedrin.
3,"Big and bulky, with tiny pockets","As you can tell, I was expecting something a little smaller than what arrived. This diaper bag is HUGE. The pockets are confusing and small, there is 1 larger pocket that I use to hold everything, but the tiny pockets all around I find confusing and they hold what? earrings?It does NOT fit below my double stroller easily and I have to use my feet to cram it in there. the stroller rings/links I find useless, but obviously needed since it won't fit in the compartment below.Pros about it are...um. The material seems well made, and it has a soft shoulder strap to minimize discomfort. The changing pad is a nice size too."
2,too bulky,"I was very excitted with the bag, but after few weeks it was a hassle to have this big bag. The colors are great. But the big compartment is not so well designed, my husband always have a hard time in opeing it.The Ipod compartment seems to be on a odd location too"
5,"Everything I need, and then some!","This diaper bag is wonderful! From the super easy to sanitize diaper changing pad, to the genius of ease of one-handed zipping over the entire product, it screams ""WINNER!"" It's made of an easy to wipe, easy to sanitize material that will NEVER look cheap! It's stylish, functional, and full on wonderful space! There's even a pocket that, though intended to hold a fresh bottle, is sized perfectly to hold my water bottle instead since I'm breastfeeding!!!The BEST part: Tons of space WITHOUT the bulkiness of traditional diaper bags.Nothing but PRAISE to JJ Cole!!!"
3,"Good looking, mostly well-functioning bag, BUT...","I've had this bag for about 3 months now. It's attractive, and I have received several compliments. The changing pad is quite large, and the nicest I've found. The side pockets hold bottles and sippy cups well. BUT after about 1 month of normal use, there is a huge tear in the fabric near the top of the bag. I'm so disappointed. I'm still using it, but I'll probably try to mend it. The bag wasn't cheap!"
1,Terrible Bag!!!!!,This bag is absoluteley horrid!!!! I bought it because it seamed like a nice bag but I was horribly wrong. The bag is expensive and barely holds anything. The zipers broke very easily and the company I bought it from will not replace the bag due to the fact that I no longer had the reciept. I didnt buy this off of amazon though so its not amazon that wont replace the bag its a different company. I will never buy JJ Cole products ever again and I will absolutely no recomend them to anyone.
2,Do Not Recommend,"When I first bought this bag, I was happy with it. I liked the different compartments it had to put things in, the changing pad it comes with is really handy when you're out and about, and I liked the fact that it was a messenger bag. I picked it because I liked the way it looked, and I thought the padding on the strap would be more comfortable than other diaper bags out there (although it did hurt my neck and back after carrying it for a while). My problem with the bag is that it didn't take long before it started becoming frayed and eventually it got so worn, that the main compartment of the zipper broke and it was no longer usable. I don't remember how long it took for it to break, but it was before I was ready to retire the diaper bag. I'm in the market for a new diaper bag for my second baby, but I will definitely not be buying this one again."
2,"Looks Great, Zipper's Not","We bought this because of the great design and the non-baby bag look. Pockets, changing pad, stroller hangers all work well. Unfortunately the zipper doesn't. We just had our second bag fail just like the first, and because it goes around the side they are instantly useless."
3,Too heavy,Great quality bag with nice hardware and great design. I loved it the 1st time I saw it. Only disappointed with its weight...it's heavy even without any contents (3.5 lbs). Wish the shoulder pad was removable also.
1,Not Impressive,We received this bag and the zipper brole in the fiurst week. Not very well made. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Bummer of a Bag,"J.J. Cole let me down with this one -- I loved the bag initially because of the thoughtful design - there is a pocket for nearly everything (especially keys which I tend to lose in the pit of every tote I've ever owned). Well, the bag ripped at the seams and fell apart in 2 and a half months of use! I am quite disappointed in the shoddy quality from an otherwise respected brand. And one of the few bags that both my husband and I could both wear without it looking like a diaper bag."
5,Love it!,"This is a great bag! It is well made and easy to use. There is plenty of usable space, but it doesn't feel too big. The front pouch holds my stuff (keys, cell phone etc), and I keep sunglasses and a water bottle in the side pockets. The front pouch easily lifts up to access more flat pockets. The main compartment is unzipped from the top, and there is lots of room for cloths, clothes, and the diaper pad pouch. There is also a side pouch for more storage (I put a blanket and cloths there too). It easily attaches to a stroller (I have a bugaboo), and the bag itself can hook and unhook with the 2 clasps easily, leaving the hooks on the stroller itself. The color is nice - not too bright, and my husband doesn't mind carrying the bag if he needs to. The shoulder strap is padded and adjustable, and comfy to carry over the shoulder."
2,looks nice but not terribly functional,"The title says it all really. It's cute, but doesn't hold much, especially considering how large it looks. I bought a big purse and keep a gallon sized freezer bag with diapers, etc in it. That is more convenient."
4,Great bag and price!!,"I do agree with everyone else. This bag is GREAT! The price is right. I had an Emily Stork Sak. I paid a little under $200 for it. The company wouldn't even replace the bag, I had to go to the store I bought it at. It has been a month with no word on the bag. I would have purchased this one over that one in a heartbeat, had I seen it first. I have 2 kids, a 2 1/2 year old and a 3 month old. Everything and more fits in the bag. I love how it attaches to the stroller. I am going to purchase the stroller attachment for the Petunia Picklebottom bag. They are made a little bit better. I only gave it 4 stars because mine seems to be falling apart already. I have only had it for 3 days. For as cheap as it was, if this one falls apart, I'll just buy a new one. GREAT PURCHASE!!"
1,Why should I have to rate this?,"Same here, didn't work. It's not region free as the back of the box says. My SONY BD player failed to read this after struggling for few seconds. So, basically it's a zero star, not one!"
1,it doesnt work,"ok so i was excited for this disc to arrive.. and it doesnt work.. its not region free. and that isnt good $35 down the drain.sometimes you really wish amazon did not sell dvds, blurays that arent from this region. its confusing, misleading.Fifa World Cup 2006: All the Goals [Blu-ray]"
3,Nice piece of Literature!,"Amado is one of my favorite writers, so it is no surprise that Jubiaba is a wonderful literary piece. This book truly gives a glimpse of Bahian culture and the role of Afro-Brazilian religious traditions in the average Bahiano's daily life. The book's cover and publishing is a bit dated, but like the old saying goes, ""don't judge this book by it's cover""!"
3,A hidden gem of Brazilian literature.,"Jubiaba was one of Jorge Amado's earliest novels. It's set in the Bahia region of Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s. It follows Antonio, an orphan who grows up to become a boxer, a circus fighter, and finally labor agiatator. Antonio isn't particularly heroic, in fact, he mainly tries to avoid responsiblity and live the high life, but when he becomes involved in fighting for the union to have decent wages, he finally realizes there was biggest things at work, and he finds a cause worth fighting for."
3,Less than anticipated,"3M brand has a good reputation, but I am disappointed in the small quanity (feet) of tape in this roll for the money. Just over 10 feet = 40.7 cents per foot for 3/4 inch wide plastic tape!"
1,Rip off,"Argh, we bought these expecting to get the multi-pack as pictured.Instead we were sent a loose roll from an open package!"
3,"The 1955 Shrine Concert, live, but not great","The gospel singers are in good form and deliver their songs with fervor, but not the fervor that comes from other live performances. All of the Clara Ward 'live' albums are infectious because the congregation or audience feels the music and the responds accordingly. This album was a disappointment to me."
4,Travel in time and meet Mary Queen of Scots,While some of the language and action in this book is a little dated it is a good read.Penelope is sent to her mother's Aunt and Uncle's farm to recover from an illness. While there she discovers she has the family ability to move through time. She travels back to an earlier time at the farm when the master is trying to save Mary Queen of Scots. Penelope knows the plan is in vain but tries to help all she can. The previous owners seem to accept her sudden appearances and mysterious absences but in her own time no one notices she's been gone.A good read for ages 9 - 12.
3,Sega CD,"The Sega CD was a very good add-on for the Genesis, but the major problem with it was all the crappy games that came out for it. They were a lot of FMV games which the whole game was just a horrible movie instead of a video game. Also they were a lot of Genesis cart to Sega CD convertions, or a lot of Genesis games get converted to the Sega CD format just for the redbook audio. They were some very good games for the Sega CD, here is a small list of some of the best games for the Sega CD:Sonic CDSnatcher (The rarest Sega CD game)AH3 ThunderhawkAndroid AssultAny Working Designs published gamesSilpheedRobo Aleste"
3,"Ahead of it's time, but shoddy library kills it","Released as an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega CD was a disc based console made in an attempt to give Nintendo a run for their money (which led to a botched deal with Sony, but that's a story for another day). The Sega CD managed to deliver games that featured full motion video in the games, so for some it was like playing an interactive movie. However, this really did nothing to enhance gameplay on the games (just give Night Trap or the Make Your Own Music Video series a look to see what I mean), a department which many of the games released for the Sega CD lacked. Ultimately, the Sega CD's shoddy library killed the system, but there were a few gems that could be found in the system's library, and they are listed below:Lunar: Silver Star StoryLunar 2: Eternal BlueShining Force CDSonic CDSnatcherMortal KombatEternal ChampionsAH3 ThunderhawkSilpheedGround Zero TexasPopful MailLethal Enforcers"
3,"well, cd vs cartridge....cartridge","as cool as it is, it plays cd's. it has a menu screen, it has space shooters, it weighs a few pounds, but I compared games for both systems, and I didnt see a difference. i do believe some games had cd quality music, it is a piece of history, the first cd system by sega. depending on your genre on games will depend if you like the games exclusive for this system. if you collect sonic games, get it, it has sonic cd, which is suppossed to be one of the best sonic games, ever."
2,another atempt from sega to improve the life span of the genesis,"Back in the early 90's Sega was releasing these consoles, the 32X and Sega CD. It's a rip off. The thing is huge and weighs a ton, also it's just too much. The thing sits next to the Genesis and makes it seem bigger, messier, and physicaly unpresentable. Best of all, it needs it's own power adapter. I don't recomend this model. If you own a model one Genesis you should get a model one CD add-on, it sits on the bottom so it doesn't take up as much space. The thing itself may be crap, but I never said the games weren't good."
3,Well Argued,"Highly recommended reading whether you agree with the author or not. A revealing quote from this book: ""I do not want to hear another word about drugs or crime without hearing in the same breath about decent jobs, adequate housing and egalitarian education."" Those are all addressed together, from the opposing point of view, in Heather MacDonald's ""The Burden of Bad Ideas."" Read them together and form your own opinion as to the cause of failure in urban America. Reed argues well but I think MacDonald wins in this debate."
4,The music was composed by,Harpo Marx's son Bill Marx ! and it's very nice and funky..... This movie is alot of fun if you love 70's schlock
3,"Scream,Blacula,Scream. only good thing is pam. pretty bad movie.","this is a cheezy flick, pam grier is the only reason to watch, other than that this movie and its sequel is better to watch on cable."
4,WILLIAM MARSHELL IS A GREAT ACTOR!,"This is a cool film!A must see for every-one!I also recommend,Blacula.William M.plays the dark prince,Manuwalde.This is much better than #1!A hip,bloody,cool,sexy,out of this world version of ""Dracula""only this time it's BLACULA!"
4,"I'm sorry, I haven't any ........ bread","Yeah right, two pimps gonna take out Blacula? Think again. Blacula is one cool cat with the ladies and is solid as a 70's soul vampire. Pam Grier as a voodoo princess is hot to trot, but no nude scenes in this one.Dynamite fashions galore in this one brother. I ain't jivin', dis be the flick to see on a dark night wit yo woman. If she don't look as sweet as Pam, then pretend."
3,Fun... but a bit hard to watch at times.,"Pam Grier was a goddess as always, and Marshall was again great as Blacula. Still, this movie needed a better script and better supporting actors/actresses."
3,Badula,"William Marshall should've been a big star. He was trained in one of England's acting schools. But as a man of color in the 70s, he had to take roles like this. The first Blacula was excellent. But this one wasn't. It was too predictable. The other shocking thing about this movie is the production value. After the first Blacula became a hit, you would think that the studios would have put more money into its sequels. But the studis didn't. And while Pam is one of my favorite 70s actress, this movie wasn't her best. Pass!!"
1,Don't Bother .. Bogus Timberline Offer,Don't bother ordering ... This item climbed to the top of the movers and shakers because Timberline ran a bogus offer and then canceled the orders. DK tools is most likely a front for Timberline to get orders from unsuspecting buyers. Buy anywhere else. Timberline has terrible feedback for good reason.
2,Doesn't fit Bosch 4000-07,"Just does not fit a Bosch 4000-07 without removing the plastic panel that makes up the dust collection housing.The wrench supplied was of very poor quality consiting of what looked like a piece of metal welded onto a hex shaped channel that was supposed to resemble a 22mm or 23mm socket. Also the case seemd to be very flimsy for the money. I've since returned the dial-a-dado and replaced it with the super dado and it also comes with a similar case.On a postive note, Changing the arbor from right to left to fit the Bosch 4000-07 was straight forward and had it worked on my saw I would have kept it and just replaced the wrench with a real socket. Great concept but seems to be limited in application."
1,"doesn't work with craftsman 10"" saw","Great reviews in magazines, but will not work with craftsman. nuts hit the arbor and the wrench will not fit the nut. I would have loved to use this dado but I guess the forgot not everyone ownes a unisaw. Very dissappointed."
1,Not for Craftman table saws,"Got this for Christmas, the case is cheap plastic, not what I would expect for the price. The back blade has lock nuts for the hub, I would expect tapped screws. On my 10in Sears Craftsman they hit the arbor casting so would have to be spaced out. The front blade has a recess in the hub for your arbor nut. In my case the recess is not large enough to get a wrench (socket) on the saw's nut ( the wrench that come with it is for a smaller nut); also, with all the blades on it's too wide for the arbor. I never cut anything with it as was too much trouble for the price."
2,Doesn't fit DeWalt 748 hybrid table saw,"Technically, I suppose it DOES fit the saw. However, the supplied arbor wrench does not, nor will any combination of ratchet and socket that I could come up with since the throat opening on the saw interferes with getting anything other than a wrench onto the arbor shaft with the stack set up for a normal 3/4"" dado cut. As popular as the DeWalt hybrid saw is, I can't imagine there aren't thousands of disgruntled woodworkers out there like me who are fuming over Freud's short-sighted designers."
2,DOESN'T WORK ON ALL SETTINGS!!,"I puchased this blade to replace an old wobble blade. I didn't mine the cheap case it came in as much as when ajusting it to it's full width,it was to wide to fit on my arbor with a nut. After paying this price I expect it to work in all widths. I have a Delta unisaw, so I do not know what saw you would have to have to meet it's full specifications? I returned it."
2,Doesn't fit RIDGID tablesaws!,"The Ridgid TS3650's blade-mounting arbor is too short for this dado set. The widest dado setting you can *safely* dial up to is about 1/2"". Also, the special wrench provided by Freud doesn't fit the arbor nut.C'mon, Freud, why no warnings in your sales literature?? As a regular user of your saw blades, you really let me down. So much for my brand loyalty."
3,Try to get it sharpened,"I run a small woodworking shop and I purchased the Dial-A-Width Dado. I think it is a great dado, but it has a -12 degree grind on it. Every sharpening shop in Denver cannot sharpen it without buying an expensive computer program for their machines and they will not buy it unless they can make enough off the sharpening to pay for it. I called Freud about having them sharpen it and they said they are not in the sharpening business. Buyer beware."
2,not bad,well this is not a bad idea...maybe that game will sell more on the Xbox...maybe this will help the franchise even more
1,cant play it,"We bought this game and the other one that is similar with the understanding that it would work on our 360, but either disc's wont play. Error codes that we do not have the right hard drive to play it...so we bought another hard drive and it still wont work. We are selling them when we have a yard sale...by the time I send it back i will end up losing more money than what I paid for it. Disappointing!"
5,fun times!,we bought this as a gift for our close friend. he brings it over all the time to play and it's given us HOURS of fun with our friends. love the game.
1,Doesn't Play,I bought this game together with 2 other games that I played for a couple weeks before I even started this one.It wont play.I would like to send it back and get another one as soon as I can. Hopefully I can return it.
4,Scarce Doo Wop On CD,Doo Wop 45's on CD Volume 9 is a nice compilation of scarce Doo Wop songs.The recordings are the originals and the sound quality is very good.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the complete lack of liner notes.
2,How to answer the telephone,I guess I'm not a member of the first reviewer's Timm fan club. The sense of humor is an acquired taste. The text might be best for a high school business class but I guess I expected more.
5,The expert scores again!,"Dr. Timm has done it again. This book covers all the basics of oral communication-- not just presentations. He talks about conversations, interviews, telephone calls-- things we all do every day. This is a ""must read"" for every young business person."
5,Great background or driving music!,"This CD was given to me as a gift, and I must admit, I was a little skeptical. Much to my surpirse and delight, it's a fabulous CD with a mix of world influences. I'm in the process of tracking down entire albums from some of the artists on Women of Spirit."
5,Women of Spirit,"I had purchased this CD several years ago and totally wore it out. I was missing the music and went looking for another. Unfortunately, it is not being released anymore. I was able to buy a new copy from a dealer on Amazon. I am once again a very happy listener. I had great service and I will try this again."
5,pure listening pleasure,"Although this cd stands well on its own as a collection, I think that all the artists who've contributed to this cd are wonderful. However, its best use is as a jumping-off point to find these incredible voices. I've since added several more cds to my collection because of it... I'll be adding more of these women to my collection as $ permits. I used to be so eager to play this cd, I'd pop it into my laptop, kept in my backpack, and listen to it (dancing only a little, so as to avoid being dragged away by men in white coats) on the subway. My interest in it has since mellowed, but it's still a great album, gaining a lot of time in the player. I have to admit, Ani DiFranco's song ""Done Wrong"" doesn't ""fit"" with the rest...but I think it still belongs here, among these other great works."
4,Introduction to Passport Books,Passport must have a dozen or so regional books covering all of France. This was the first one I read. It made me really want to explore the region rather than just hit the Autoroute off the ferry and drive pell mell to Paris. In fact that's just what I plan to do. Should have gone to Fecamp when I was a young 'un. Now is the time to visit some beaches plus view the Normandy invasion sights.
3,BLOODY CUT,"Filmed way down under in Southern Australia, this slasher flick has moments of suspense and surprise, but ultimately it fails to achieve what it probably wanted: to be an original, frightening slasher movie. Unfortunately, it's resolution of who the killer is far exceeds the bounds of credibility, even for a horror movie. Molly Ringwald chews up the scenery like a young Bette Davis or Tallulah Bankhead. While her performance is far less campy, she adds a kind of sophisticated stupidity to her role. Kylie Minogue has a brief part and like many pop singers should stick to singing. The direction is adequate, but doesn't fully approach the realm of terror it needs. The rest of the cast perform adequately, but as in most of the newer slasher flicks, the plot holes and ridiculous actions of the cast, prevent CUT from being more than just another entry in a dying genre."
1,Cut DOESN'T make the cut!,"I got this solely because I LOVE Molly Ringwald. Normally, she can pull off impossibly droll or stupid movies, just by lending her talent. But ""Cut"" is one of those that even Molly couldn't save and it just tortures you with its horror rip-offs and cliches. If given a choice between getting into a tank full of venemous snakes or watching this movie , even with my severe phobia, I would choose the snakes. This movie deserves 0- stars but they do not have a rating that low so I am forced to give it a 1."
4,CUT - the best australian horror movie ever,"as an aussie, i truely recommend you check out CUT, it is one of the first movies in its genre that has been made in over 10 years in Australia. I attended the world premier in Sydney i was in the the 5th row and Molly Ringwold was standing only 10 feet away form my seat. Anyway back to the film, i think it holds up to nearly anything that Hollywood can make, it borrows such great horror scenerios and themes that blend in from the ""Elm St."" series, and and all the Jason movies. On a highg note it is better than most american horror. Its a pity you americans are only now getting to see this film as it was released in Australia in March 2000, but really didnt make the cut with the aussie audience as as we are always brainwashed by american horror such a s the ""scream"" series. So dont be afraid to check out this little aussie gem with a little american flare."
3,Third Billing...,"Not a bad film at all. Actually, a bit better (and better acted)than any of the big studio slasher flicks that have recently been produced here on American soil. However, if you're thinking of making this purchase simply because it includes Kylie Minogue, think again. Her third billing status does not reflect her screen time: she's through before the first five minutes are. Molly Ringwald, on the other hand, has a meaty roll--if unchallenging (and not to infer anything maligning about Molly's acting ability)--and is quite winning as a self-absorbed and limited actress."
4,"A Return to the ""Stalk-n-Slash"" Flicks of the 80's.","This Aussie Entry into the Slasher Genre is one of the most Old Fashioned Slasher pics to come out of the ""Scream"" Generation. If I didn't know any better, I Swear that it was made in the 80's. It features Utterly Brutal Killings; Blatant nods to it Competition (especially ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legends - Final Cut"") and the Coolest Killers mask since the ""Scream"" Ghost face.The Blood runs Thick, the Victims run Quick and the Clichés run the Longest. If you were to play a Drinking game where you Drank every time you saw something in ""Cut"" that you've seen in Another horror movie, you'd be Drunk before the Opening Credits ended."
1,Awful Aussie Flick,"When I first heard about Cut, I was excited. For one, Australia was finally making a horror film of it's own. I couldn't wait to see it. I heard promising results. Then, after seeing it, I was VERY dissapointed. I allowed myself to buy the DVD before seeing it, and I instantly wished I had my money back. The acting is terrible. Molly Ringwald's character is the only one fit to watch. Don't waste your money on this one, folks. I regretted it."
1,Another Preteen Scream movie,"Cut is awful on all levels. It starts just like Scream and then we realize its a movie being filmed. Very unoriginal and be done before(He Knows Alone 1980)and then Scream 2 copied it of course and now Cut copys the same idea. These teens these days don't know good Horror. I will stick to the classics(1978/Halloween, 1984/A Nightmare On Elm Street, 1984/Silent Night,Deadly Night(92 min UNCUT),not the (85 min) Censored Double Feature DVD ,1981/The Burning Uncut by Dragon,not Vipco), 1977/Dawn Of The Dead."
2,Ewww... It's horrible,"I was at my local video store and i ran into CUT. The movie seemed interesting so i rented it. First of all the concept was interesting, a cursed movie, whomever tries to screen or finish the movie dies. The characers in the movie are very two-dimensional which translates into not caring who lives or dies. The killer eliminates them in very boring ways with very little imagination or even suspense. Molly Ringwald was ok her character(a washed-up actress,how appropriate) had only one setting (bitchy). The fabulous Kylie Minogue had a great cameo unfortunatly she was eliminated too soon. In conclusion i would not recommend this movie its very dull and uninteresting, a great concept that was poorly executed."
3,Funny,"The best thing this movie has going for it is the humor. Wheather it be intentional or not. The movie has some suspensful moments I especially liked the killers mask, but for some reason it was hard for me to be scared of a killer with an Australian accent. I kept expecting him to start wrestling an alligator or something. This movie also had one the funniest death scenes I have seen in a long time the killer starts melting and screaming and it just seems to go on forever hilarious."
4,Not bad Aussie horror flick,"I rented this movie about a month ago.I kept thinking I rented this horrid slasher film and it's gonna [stink],but I was really very wrong.I thought it was actually scary in parts of it.The acting wasn't bad at all.It was actually good to see Molly Ringwald back on film.My only complaint on this movie is that,they drug it out too long in the end.I recamend this to anyone who likes horror/slasher flicks.Give it a try!"
3,Not As Bad As I Thought It Would Be,"Okay, so this is not the best horror film out there. And so what if it copies the premise of the last Nightmare On Elm Street movie. The story is entertaining enough, the acting is okay, believe me there is much worse out there, and the production seems well done. Molly Ringwald is her usual self, the rest of the cast fits the movie. The gore is decent and overall it is not a bad film to rent with another movie to balance it out. Most horror movie fans will enjoy this I think, it is not great but certainly worth the time to watch it."
2,Outdated material,"My family was very disapointed to arrive in several U.S. cities(Sacramento, Los Angeles, Pasadena,and Northridge in California and Portland and Ashland, Oregon), armed with our veggie guide book, only to discover many of the restaurants were out of business. The latest printing says 1998 yet one restaurant in Sacramento, Ca. (Marline's Vegetable Patch), we were told, had been closed for four years. This book needs a serious update. We were let down numerous times and it really messed up our plans. The resource woud be great if it really had been revised in 1998. Also, there are some great Vegan and vegetarian restaurants that are left off the list completely. It makes me wonder who is doing the scouting for Vegetarian Journal."
2,Outdated,"I agree with the other reviewers that the material in this book is extremely outdated. Instead of just showing up at the establishment, I called ahead to inquire about hours, etc. I would estimate about 2/5 of the calls I made were disconnected numbers. I hope the VRG decides to revise and create another edition of this book, as the concept is fantastic. My advice is to hold off purchasing this book."
1,7-keto,I don't feel this product helped me at all. I have taken it for almost 60 days and still no change.
1,Don't buy this!,"After having travelled around Vietnam for a month recently, I bought this as I thought it would be great to show friends more about the country etc.This dvd is an absolute waste of money. It's extremely short - the main movie only goes for 45 mins. She shows you nothing in depth of Hanoi or other towns. She offers hardly any advice about where to stay etc. Her trip on the Reunification Express was pitiful. She didn't show any other options on this train - apart from sitting on a hard and cheap wooden seat for 24 hours. There are heaps of other options on this train (air conditioned sleepers etc).Do yourself a favour and don't waste your money buying this dvd."
3,Please read this......,"Here we go again. I enjoyed most of this DVD about Vietnam. The part that really rattled my cage about Ms. Shapiro was her venture into a one star hotel with non existent plumbing. At least she will have you believe that virtually all hotels have 4th class accommodations. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am an American and I visited Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An and Saigon in November 2009. All of my hotels were sparkling clean, had functioning plumbing and were well lit. My tour of Vietnam cost about $100 a day which is very economical by most standards. I suppose if you were searching for a very cheap hotel and wanted to spend about 10,000 Dong (about fifty cents) per night, this is what you would find. For those who saw this video, and for those contemplating a trip to this wonderful country, please go and have the experience of a lifetime. The people are friendly, the scenery is phenomenal and the cost will surprise you. Cheers!"
5,They're cables,"They're cables, they do their job well, There that's it, ha! i used all three theres!"
1,"A great book, worthy of a champion--NOT.","One expected (MUCH) more from a world champion who has written several top-notch advanced books on backgammon. On this one he tries--and fails miserably--to capture the style of the truly great 70's book on backgammon, Bruce Becker's Backgammon for Blood. That book, though seriously flawed on tactics and strategy, had a joie de vie about it which stimulated more than one beginner to carry on with the game. ""Winners"" is more a a damp, white bread, mayonaise sandwich. It's not clear that's it the same author who did the advanced books. Other in-print books must do the job better and several out-of-print ones far, far surpass this one."
4,Good beginner book,"This book is as good as any for the raw beginner. The great Robertie explains the rules of the game, basic objectives, and opening moves, and then takes you through three sample games. That's about it, and if you're an experienced player you won't learn anything from it you don't know already. On the plus side, Robertie's conversational style is more enjoyable than some of the older beginner books, and he tries to explain things that aren't obvious to the novice (for example, a 5-5 looks like a great roll here, here's why it's not). All in all, a short user-friendly guide for the novice."
3,I guess is great for beginners,"I've been playing backgammon tournaments for 2 months now, and while I read the book cover to cover, it left me wishing for something more. It does help a lot if you are REALLY new to the game. Don't get me wrong, you'll get some good tips from the book....just not enough from a world champion, at least not in this book."
3,Is it just me?,"I've only been playing backgammon about 6 months. Before reading this book, I won maybe 50% of the time against other beginners, and when I lost I usually didn't lose too badly. However, after reading the book and trying the ""aggressive"" style of play advised by Robertie, I find that I lose almost all the time and generally take a real beating in the process. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this game, and I'll certainly continue to try the aggressive style of play discussed in the book (the author is, after all, a champion player), but I'm surely frustrated by my results so far... Your mileage may vary, of course."
3,Good. Not much depth. But the price is right.,Not very much depth of coverage here. Very solid for a beginner. Some helpful tips for intermediate players. Good value. Robertie gives clear advice. I plan on studying his more advanced books now.
4,Arrrrrrrrrr Matey,"If you didn't look at the booklet, you could almost envision seeing this album made thirty years ago, somewhere around the end of the 60's. It has a real timeless feel to it. At times it sounds kind of like the Doors - mostly because of the prominent use of the organ in some songs. At times though, it sounds kind of campy and pirate-y (hence the Arrr matey), but I can live with those couple instances. Overall very impressive debut. Good stuff."
4,aboard the good ship 'coral',"drunken pirate jingles galore in this one. A rousing debut album from these 21st century psychedelica revivalists. There's plenty of early syd barret on 'simon diamond' a song about a man evolving into a tree/plant. 'Goodbye' however is an ode to perhaps more of the west coast late 60's psychedelica than the northern english variety while 'dreaming of you' has a foot stomping groove both pulsating and mournful.There's a bit of dub throwen in for good measure, a nursery rhyme with 'badman' and even some Lalo schfrin like guitars after final track 'calenders and clocks' concludes the album.An extremely competent debut that provides ample proof that their is still a pulse in British music. It is both populists and experimental - challenging and refreshing."
4,buckets of wierdness = fun,"Hmmm, musical journey ahoy!The Coral take us on a sonic trip to spliffsville and back, mixing many musical styles into one brew. Hard rock, Psychadellica, electronica all add flavour with guitars screaming on some tracks, played lovingly on others, some kick in with dark and dreary keyboards similar to something from The Adams Family.""Is it any good tho?"" You may ask, well.. Its different, with some tracks being beautiful electronica slips similar to what Gerling have been producing, others sound like a funeral procession on valium.after a listen or two i really got into it, it kinda reminded me of Morphine in a wierd removed way, maybe its just the darkness of it all. Its not for everyone, but you should at least give it a listen and make up your own mind."
2,What a load of hype!,"Though the music is not the same as ""Fishbone"", I cannot help but think this band sounds like a watered down version of that seminal '80's band. Go get the original and leave this copy on the shelf where it belongs."
1,More Hype,"Is it possible that The Coral are the biggest new hype in England? On the evidence of their eponymous debut, they may just be the most hyped band of all time. The Skelly brothers and their bandmates traffic in 60's rock, Nuggets-style. Though plenty of bands have brought an original stamp to faux psychedelia (Clinic comes to mind), these Liverpudlian dunderheads just create xeroxes of fakes. They open with a seafaring shanty called ""Spanish Main"" and go out with ""Calendar and Clocks"" about the perfidy of time. Time sure is fickle, boys, especially when you know that yours' passed thirty odd years ago."
2,Major Disappointment,"As is the case with most Pat Boone CDson sale here, these are re recordings.The only thing which prevents this purchasefrom being a total disaster is the inclusionof some halfway decent cover songs.I would not recommend buying this CD."
1,Not very happy,This book said that it is like new and it was far from being like new. It was not really damaged but it had stuff stuck to the cover and it was not taken care of very well.
1,a joke right?,These are pathetic. too thick and cheap. They peel off quickly and are definitely not professional in appearance at all. I was hoping to sell the c.d.'s i bought this for but now it looks like that won't be an option. Consider light scribe c.d.'s if you want an image on a c.d.
2,Only 30 actual CD labels!!,"I purchased the item for someone in my office and while I am sure it will work fine, be warned there are actually only 30 CD labels in this kit. The rest of the over 100 labels are for the jewel case which we really don't use in my office. Yes, there are front cover labels, spine labels... it's almost ridiculous that there aren't more actual CD labels. Had I know this, I would've just purchased an applicator and large package of labels for not much more."
4,it was just what i needed,because the one i had broke and needed to be replacedcan't label my dvd's effectively without itI am wouldn't use anything other than memorex
1,Out Dated,"The disk it comes with to install the program on your computer is out dated.... way out dated... try Windows 98, 2000 or XP, and the bad thing is it wont work with anything newer then that. I called Memorex and they sent me templates to use with Word and that doesnt work!!! Look for something with new software!!!"
3,"Great Labels, but...","Everything in the package is fine, absolutely nothing wrong with the labels or anything. I only wish the description had been a bit more clear.I was expecting 138 DISC labels total. But there are only 38 disc labels, and the rest are DVD labels, jewel case inserts, etc. And hey, these are cool things to have around and use, it's just not what I was expecting.So, just be sure you know what your purchasing (unlike me!)"
5,The Jinx by Larry Kahn,"Right up there with the ""number 1"" mystery/thriller writers (even the other lawyer/authors). Believable plot (enough researched facts to make it plausible) and multi-faceted characters. The story pulls the reader in and doesn't let go until the end - a real ""can't put it down"" read."
5,"The Jinx, by Larry Khan, is an absolute winner!","Move over John Grisham, Larry Khan deserves high praise for his thrilling and thought provoking masterpiece, The Jinx! Khan's initial effort is nothing short of fanstastic! Woven into its page turning suspense, Khan deals with the issue of racism in the United States. Rarely do novels entertain as well as enlighten readers to important issues affecting our society. Khan does both! Ben Kravner, a young trust-estates attorney, and all around nice guy, stumbles onto a 160 year old consiracy against the presidency to set in place action to begin ""the next civil war"" in America. With the help of the internet, collegues, and an old flame, these excitingly dynamic characters plot to stop the conspiracy, save the country from certain disaster, and at the same time challenge our views of race. The good guys are really good! The bad guys are really BAD! Together they are FANTASTIC! If you're not reading Larry Khan's The Jinx, you're missing the boat!"
2,"Coatng thin, comes off easily, food sticks","It is a thin, light pan, with a big wooden handle, so it's easy to lift and turn. Because its thin, it gets hot spots in the ""corner"" where the base meets the sides. Meat gets welded on, and does not soak off (lots and lots of scrubbing). Also the coating is thin, comes off easily and scratches grow. I recommend spending more money to get a heavier pan."
5,Great Organization,The best thing about this book is the way it is organized! It is set up in progressing levels of difficulty and is pretty much a trouble shooting guide! You go to the Canter section and find the problem you're having and it gives you many good tips for fixing your problems!!! It is by no means a replacement for a trainer but a very close second! I consult it many times when my trainer isn't around!
5,"Durable, comfortable, and functional","I've used leather work gloves for years, but these have become my favourite glove by a long, long margin. I've used them for woodworking, electrical, plumbing and general maintenance for the last year and a half, and I finally need to buy a new pair. These have just enough padding to protect your hands while having great flexibility and feel. You can peel duct tape with them on, change a blade on your chop saw, replace a wall outlet, or frame in a new room. They have just the right balance between protection and flexibility to easily cross over from delicate to rugged work. The only thing wrong with them? They're no good in the wet, they soak it right up. But that's a small price to pay for a great pair of work gloves."
2,Fem caps??,This is not what I thought it was. the manufacture changed the ingrediants it is no longer as affective as it use to be. You can buy other cheaper over the counter medicine like pamprin. It is not the sellers fault.
2,femcaps,"i ordered the product Femcaps but when i got them they had changed ingredients the box looked the same but when i opened and saw the packets were different i read the box for the ingredients and they had changed i called and was then told they had changed them, but i was not told that at the time of ordering, i sent them back they were billed to my visa and i hope they credit my visa . I called and talked to someone and i ordered a different product Mygrex i hope it will be as good as the old Femcaps."
1,Only for die-hard fans of Klaus Kinski,"The whole movie is boring. The only reason to buy it is the scene with Klaus Kinski, which you can - fortunately - access directly. A shame that great Maestro Kinski accepted to waste his talent in such a crappy film. For Kinski alone I give one star."
4,Yes and No,"I've had ""Afro-Latino"" for several years now. When it was new (to me), I played it over and over, as did all the other reviewers, even dancing around the room or on the steering wheel at times.However, playing it again today after a long break shocked me! The CD created a new listening experience. There's a sound machine in most of the tracks, too loud and way too annoying. I had to fast-forward on all tracks except the last two. I found most of the songs repetitive--the same beat, the same rhythm over and over.I gave the CD four stars because of my initial reaction, in gratitude for being introduced to a new music (to me). Putumayo does that: introduce listeners to new music, new experiences, ones that might not come across the table otherwise. I see this CD is no longer available. That's a shame.Even though I state my new dislike of the sound machine, I still recommend this CD."
3,So-So Salsa,"""Afro-Latino"" is a so-so salsa compilation from Putumayo. It's a decade old, but hasn't aged quite so well. There are highlights from Tam Tam 2000 and the 4 Etoiles. The songs do have a savory rhythm, but as noted before, it does get repetitive.When it comes to Afro-Latino music, I'd recommend the late Andy Palacio and the Garifuna Collective, as well as the Afro-Peruvian fusion group Nova Lima,and diva Susana Baca. ""Afro-Latino"" is a good introduction to this style of salsa, but it's still only an introduction."
4,Feel the Rhythms in Afro-Latino music,"Welcome to the sensational music of Putamayo Artists. This album is a wonderful introduction to Afro-Cuban sounds. Combinations of 'Cubanesque' rhythms and African folk rhythms create a irresistable sound that, as the CD claims, is ""Guaranteed to make you feel good!"" I used to live in Miami and this music reminds me of the Cuban passion for good music. If you are not familiar with this sound, this album would make a wonderful initiation into the world of 'musica Latina'. This CD includes a booklet which explains how Cuban sounds are introduced into African culture. It also details each artist featured, which instruments played (some you've never heard), and the background of the story being told. Be prepared to get up and dance!"
4,Rico Mammbo!,This CD has a lot of various Afro-Cuban cuts. Some have a faster beat for dancing and others are more suave. Definitely music that will make you warm when you feel the beat.
1,Wrong Item,They sent the wrong Items!I wasn't home to get them so now I don't have return info (wife cleaned up and it was garbage day)
1,Wrong title?,"The product name is ""Basswood""; the product description says ""balsa"". The two are very different. Please get it straight so that people know what they are buying."
1,"Too small, too flimsy",We decided to keep the totes because it's a hassle to return things but this product is not at all what I expected. First of all they are very small. The large tote looks like to could fit towels and such. NO WAY! It's about one square foot box maximum. The others are quite a bit smaller. They are also flimsy. I filled the large one with my son's medicines and the bag drops and doesn't stay upright. Definitely not worth it.
1,Believe the bad reviews,"This is by far the worst recorder I have ever used. It stops recording frequently in mid sentence. Unfortunately for me, I opened it too late to be able to return it to Amazon, as the 30 day window has expired. I couldn't recommend this if it were free. Stay away!"
1,Lousy,The sound and recording quality was terrible. RCA does not make a good recorder. Sony makes a good one. The RCA recording was nearly inaudible.
1,DOA,"Mine was DOA. The pkg showed it had previously been opened. I suspect someone bought it and didn't confess that the recorder didn't work when they returned it. The counter did not work in the record mode. The microphone didn't work. When I tried to count to 30 directly into the recorder microphone, what voice did record was so garbled that you couldn't understand it as a human voice. This is what you get when you order a ""used-like new"" and this is not the first time this has happened to me with Amazon.com products, unfortunately. I've learned my lesson."
1,Does Not Work,"I bought this RCA recorder and it worked twice. I wrote to the company because I no longer had the receipt, and after several weeks, got to the right person at RCA through their FB page. She acted as if she was doing me a favor and would do a one-time replacement of the item. I had to pay for shipping of the original lemon recorder back to RCA. I opened the replacement recorder and set it up, nothing happened! Another lemon! I even put in my own rechargeable batteries, switched the tapes back and forth, and there was barely movement even in the FF/Rewind options. I will not be buying RCA products any longer. RCA used to mean ""quality"" but those days are gone!"
4,Nice Recorder,"I'm a college student and have been using the, RCA PR3538R Micro-Cassette Recorder for the past year. It works great and the audio picks up well. I do sit in the first row. I would recommend this product."
4,Performance of recorder,I have had some trouble adjusting the volume to get a clear recording. I had to experiment before I received good clear reproduction without static.
1,Hate it,This is an awful cassette recorder. I rushed during Christmas to buy one and foolishly threw out the packaging and receipt so I am unable to return it. It is cheap plastic and their is no rewind or speed control.Do not buy this product!
2,You get what you pay for.,Was not completely satified with the quality of the recorder. As in the material made of. Also bulker than your hand. I would not order this one again.
3,Mini rec,I like the recorder but the description fails to mention that a ac/dc connection line can not be found. I even called the manufacture and was informed they did not have one. I went every where but no success. The wattage is not listed on the recorder so you can not but one from your local electronic store. Suggest you buy a AA battery charger as you are going to need it. I was irritated that after I complained to Amazon the price dropped $10.00.
2,Like slightly burnt popcorn,"This is a book for serious movie fans and those not easily offended. Basically this book is a collection of short essays he wrote as a movie critic. And while there were times I snorted out loud reading it, there were also boring times and a lot - I mean a lot - of swearing. I'm not enough of a movie fan to really get the full depth of this book, having not seen over 75% of the movies he talks about, but for a true movie connoisseur you will either love (if you agree with him) or hate (if you disagree with him) this book. It's also a book best read in small doses, and since they are just a collection of unrelated essays, that's easy enough to do. Reading it in one fell swoop gets tedious. True Believers was a far better book and a must-read for any sports fan."
3,For the contrarian cinemaphile.,"Look, Joe Quennan is a jerk. He thinks many, if not most movies, are just bad. He thinks many directors are overrated and most actors are shallow, preening nincompoops. And he hates Mickey Rourke. He may be right (especially about Rourke.) He is funny. Mean can be funny; look at the success of ""South Park"" or ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" In another of his books, Queenan is described as a hatchet man movie reviewer. Exactly. If you think most of the current product of Hollywood or foreign studios is tripe, this is the guy for you. This is a collection of pieces originally published elsewhere, so you will get some of the same jokes. That's okay. Just read them a day or two apart, especially where he talks about nun movies or the Blarney blather of movies made about the Irish."
4,"I disagreed quite often, but he was still very funny","I disagreed with many of Queenan's comments on various films. But, knowing that everyone is entitled to his own opinion, I found myself laughing quite often. I even found myself laughing at his rips on my favorite movies. Because he is right. Last Action Hero is an awful movie, but it is still one of my favorites. His movie heckling essay was very funny from the outside, and I found myself wishing more people would be ""Bad Movie Angels"" and refund my money after seeing the horrid stuff that passes itself off as film these days (Merchant and Ivory being a big one)."
2,"Just not very funny, that's the blunt fact of the matter...","I've got nothing against Joe Queenan's curmudgeon act--heck, that's been a staple among critics with attitude forever. But some indescrible something is lacking in his work. His jokes are all root and no tree, most of the time. I dunno, maybe it's something to do with his delivery. Mr. Cranky at mrcranky.com is good for a crude bellylaugh. P. J. O'Rourke, when he lampoons pop culture, usually puts a wicked twist in his observations. Queenan to me just seems more windy than pithy.You can add a star to this review if you are a knowledgeable movie lover, and you laugh when an actor's name serves as the punchline in a joke."
2,Repetitive Essays,"This is the first Joe Queenan book I have read (it was a gift), so I had no expectations one way or the other. I gave this book two stars only because most of the essays, taken individually, were clever and amusing if not overly funny. But read consecutively, they were very repetitive and were characterized by the same theme... that this guy seems to hate most films. He also has a somewhat pretentious writing style, which is also accentuated by the repetitive themes. He really doesn't have much to say that isn't basically mean spirited. But he is quite clever and occasionally amusing. If you buy this book, try reading an essay every month or so... but not over a short period of time."
5,The Truly Classic Set,"Not all the performances here are the best, as is usually the case for an integral set of anything. In the Vaughan Williams Fifth Symphony, for instance, I love Barbirolli's rendition on EMI and Previn's own redo on Telarc. For a complete set of these works, however, this is the one set I would choose above all others. As at least another reviewer noted, Adrian Boult has a special claim on the works of Vaughan Williams, and I have cobbled together a complete VW symphonic cycle from Boult's individual recordings of them, but Previn still takes the prize. No other set illuminates and elevates these works as this one does. By the time I write this, of course, the discs have vanished from the in-print catalog. As consolation, I'd recommend going with Boult's versions, but if you ever come across this set in decent condition, get it by all means. It's the best over the whole journey and, in some instances like the No. 7, there are no better individual recordings, period."
5,"Autres temps, autres prix.","Yes, this is a wonderful set, which I too bought when it really was at a ""rock bottom"" twenty or so dollars. Then of course Sony took over BMG/RCA. This and all those other wonderful White Box Complete Collection sets are deleted from the catalogue and acquire collectors' item status and the crazy price of $95! How very, very sad."
5,Vaughan William Nine Symphonies,I reported the CDs were not rec;d within 2 months' time. Then soon a new package was resent immnediately and I rec'd the goods within several days. This is quite different with the response from Import CDS when I was under the same circumstances. No further action was taken after reporting the lost of the delivery. I think this was irresponsible and seemed an act of cheating. Therefore I placed another new order to Amazon because Amazon gives me confidence.
5,the story of Billy Eckstine,"Unfortunately, I have not read this book. But based on this man's tremendous talent, and I have many of his recordings, and have read quite a bit about his career climb, I cannot for the life of me, figure out why this and all of the books written about him are not available through Amazon. At the peak of his career, he was regarded as the nation's top singer, or crooner. Even topping Frank Sinatra's record at the major concert halls and night clubs. Could it be that there is still so much envy regarding him by the lesser singer's that even after 12 years of his death, they still prefer to black ball his memor??J. W. Purnell"
1,broke within 3 weeks,used it for 3 weeks and the bass doesnt work anymore and after trying to get a refund for it or send it back for a defect they tell me i bought it a year ago and i had just bought it in june 2012 hasnt even been a year yet.......so yea i wouldnt buy these again
4,It is Logitech sound.,"Replaced my worn out Klipsch 5.1 system. Logitech has a sound... You either like it, or you don't. I like it, but know that it is far from audiofile sound. The system works great. the little dongle remote thing is odd, but puts volume where I need it. The speaks mout easily. I like the center mount front speak. The bass is woof woof, but nothing window shaking. It works and can easily overpower the speaks.I sit really close to all the speakers so I am immersed in Logitech sound... Hehe. It does the job. You can get used to it. I like that it is pretty loud where I am, but one room away, if the woof woof isn't turned too high, it isn't loud at all.I gave it 4 stars simply because of the Logitech sound. That's just me. I never hear anyone else talking about, ""Logitech sound""... Everything else about the system is 5 stars. I'm listening to some Black Uhuru right now pretty loud and it sounds good."
5,"Discontinued, but still the best for the money","Logitech has discontinued the and replaced them with another model, but these have way, way better reviews (on Amazon and elsewhere). I went ahead and got these to use with my HTPC for surround sound in my living room, and they are fantastic. I'm definitely glad I got these, and wish Logitech was still producing them!"
4,Great system for a computer,"PROS:-This is a great product, which follows the expectations of Logitech products in general.-I am an audiophile, and I would say these sound pretty decent for computer speakers.-The highs sound great, and the lows have good response, although aren't too strong, but that's to be expected since the subwoofer is small.-Uses analog connections, which integrates well with most sound cards (don't have to mess with S/PDIF connections)CONS:-The speaker wires aren't long enough. I have a reletively small room and the wires were far too short. If you want your speakers arranged properly for 5.1 you'll have to get some RCA cable extenders from somewhere like Radio Shack."
4,Great sound for the bucks!,"This is great for a surround computer system...I probably wouldn't get this if you are going to use it for home theater. For the price, you can't go wrong...I'm an audio nut and love this system...good bass response."
5,"Perfect for games, movies, music... ect.","I love these speakers, the only thing you have to have is the right adio slots for them, if you do then get them, I am going to buy more for friends, easy install, and sound so good, really deep bass. best speakers I have ever had. Get them."
2,Matrix Surround Sound???,"I have a Mac, in the instructions it said due to the fact I do not have the correct ports I would have to matrix the sounds to hear it in ""surround"". I didn't work the rear right and left speakers work but sound like your listening to FM radio in a tunnel! Good speakers for PC but not recommended to MAC users!"
2,It's OK but...,I got this speaker System at Circuit City (R.I.P) a couple years ago. They sound great but the Cords are just way to short and makes it so no matter what you possibly do you cannot set these speakers up CORRECTLY! just every Cord is too short even the control and it's Hardwired in like i said you cant really do anything to remedy it
3,"Terrible, Terrible quality","If you're planning to use these speakers for a computer, look somewhere else. I recommend the Klipsch ProMedia.Imagine the worst and cheapest sound quality possible, and you'll hear these speakers. I have a 5.1 audio input as well.For a TV, these might be a little better..Giving it three stars for the many speakers it comes w."
2,Refurbished surround sound system,"Item was recieved in a busted up, poorly taped box. When I took out everything a screen was busted off one of the speakers and there were scuff marks all over everything. Judging from what the box said, the user manual and at least one of the cords was missing. They responded quickly to my complaint offering to take it back, but I would have to wait a while to get my money back and at that point I didn't have time to find something else."
1,Only 5 Channels!,"These speakers are not 5.1 speakers, as they only support 5 channels. From what i can tell, these speakers ignore the LFE channel & use the center channel for the subwoofer. This is blatant false advertising on Logitech's part. If you are looking for 5.1 speakers, these are not acceptable."
3,What you would expect for the price,"This is a decent speaker system for a computer, unless you're REALLY into hard rock or listening to your music exceptionally loud. When pushed, this system WILL distort! If you're listening to a stereo source, the two surround speakers don't really kick-in(with the surround button on the control pod turned ""on"") until they're cranked up , and at that point you start hearing distortion. They work great for watching movies and other sources with encoded surround sound. And, you WILL need to buy extension cords(RCA connectors)for the surrounds, unless you're setting/mounting them on the same desk/area you're keyboard/monitor are located. I like the convenience of the control pod, which I have setting under my 20"" widescreen monitor.To be honest, I was hoping for something with a little more ""kick"", based on the pictures, but I think I got what I paid for."
4,Almost awesome.,"This product is very good, don't get me wrong. The sound out of these speakers is very good especially for its price. The only problem I have with the speakers is that I cannot get mid out of them. Only when I turn matrix on do I get the mid, but when I do it sounds very...dry. Without matrix the sound is very full and great. So my only complaint is that only with matrix do I get mid. Still this product is worth the buy. I am very satisfied with this product. Oh and the bass is not overpowering at all. You can set it to whatever level you like and it does not feel like it is the only thing you hear."
4,"Like them, love them... want some more of them",I was very plased to be able to order and receive these speakers from Amazon. The price was really quite good and far below what I could have bought them locally for. As for connection and hook up I was somewhat concerned to find out after I had ordered them that the connection options to my Mac were somewhat limted and not optimal to take full advantage of the 5.1 capabilities. I should have researched before ordering but did find some options such as USB devices to connect better with. However I went ahead and unpacked and hooked it up just to the single output connection and using the matrix option think it sounds terrific and certainly well worth the money. I have not tried movies etc. but really think for music these speakers are perfect. If when I try movies and find the sound lacking will proceed in ordering the USB digital sound adapers.
5,Great Value,"I purchased this speaker set for my PC a few months ago. Setup was quick and easy, everything is color coded and intuitive. Before I purchased this set, I read a few reviews that stated the rear speaker wires were too short. I am using this set in a 12X12 room, and the wires were long enough to reach the far back right and left corners of the room, but just barely. Quality and performance seem very high so far, although the set is not extremely loud. When watching dvd's I often have the system at 80% volume. Having said that, 5.1 surround for under $100 is amazing, and I am very satisfied with this set."
2,"Love it, *but* with Windows 7 there are big issues","I have had my Logitech 540 system for a couple of years now and have enjoyed it tremendously. But ever since going to Windows 7.1, with a Realtek onboard sound card, there are big problems and no driver updates to do anything about the issue. I have seen many other people are having the same problem on internet fora, but there seems to be a lot of 5.1 system troubles with Windows 7. I've been advised by tech guys to either get another 5.1 system by another company or to buy a new sound card - neither good options. Good luck if you want to take a chance with it."
5,"Superb 5.1 speakers, superior to the Z506","Why they call the Z506 a ""replacement"" or ""upgrade"" to these x-540 2006(first released) speakers is beyond me. These blow away the Z506 - they cost a little bit more but it is money well spent. No longer do I have to reach behind the base module to adjust the base or reach to the right speaker to adjust the volumn. The controls for both are now on the wired remote as well as a function designed to create 5.1 surround from a 2 channel source called ""matrix"" When pressed all the speakers put out sound even from a 2 channel stereo source like a mp3 file. That more than makes it worth 115.00 to me. The sounds is great, nice bass, good highs and adequate midrange. I have no complaints and should have bought this years ago."
4,Logitech X540,PLUS:System is just right for town house. Size of speakers is compact with clear sound. The ability to select the surround or stereo from the control is just great.Con: Wires are short.
3,was it just mine?,"my logitech systems came with a missing bass nobi popped open the box anxiously waiting to set it upand i noticed the controller didn't look right so i turn it on try to turn the bass higher and feel that there isn't a nob in placedisappointment,but im having fun with these speakers GREAT product its a must buy"
5,GREAT SPEAKERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!,"I think that this product is amazing. For only $75 you can get a great sounding 5.1 surround sound set-up. The sound is crisp, the bass is awesome, and everything about it is awesome! Matrix mode is cool for times when using an application that only allows 2.1 set ups. Logitech delivered a great product!"
4,A reasonably prices system for improved computer sounds.,"This is a reasonably good speaker system to upgrade the speakers that normally come with a new computer system. I had to replace this system purchased earlier due to an accident that disabled the remote on/off control. Since there apparently isn't any replacement available for a non-functioning control, be careful or you will have a system that is totally disabled."
3,Its worth for the deal,I just wanted to buy some good speaker for my notebook pc and I found this guy on deal with free shipping so I just grabbed..everything is nice with it but I can't use its 5.1 feature..Max i can go is 2.1 ..I donno why they make 5.1 digital surround system for laptops when there are not much provisions to plug to...or may be i'm missing some here...so i'm using 2 speakers and SubWoofer and packed remaining 3 speakers back to the box...
1,Annoying buzzing sound from all speakers,the metal mesh guard used to protect all these speakers makes a buzzing sound if you turn them up more than halfway. the speakers themselves are of good quality and sound.
1,Big dissapointment,"short wires, poor sound. Hard to control due to a useless matrix feature that defeats any PC adjustments. Don't buy this if you want to listen to music. Should be priced below $35 since I have $15 stereo speakers that produce better sound."
1,"Great product, buy it from someone else","The product itself is fine I know a number of people who own it. However, I strongly recommend that you do not purchase it from this vendor. I ordered it and they cancelled the order without even a courtesy email. I guess its considered good business practice to just let the customer figure it out. If you don't listen to my advice good luck but as for me I will NEVER buy anything from these people again."
2,seems like 5.1 but good at stereo,"I was looking for affordable home theather 5.1 to use with my lcd tv and ps3 also ipod touch.There is no connection option there is a convertor but you need to get another aux cable to hook up your thing.I didnt try the system with computer.The meterial quality is really awful,bass is huge and powerfull on the paper but nothing enjoyable.there is no way to use other speakers without 5.1 supported sound card on the pc.except 2 front speakers,rears and center were awful when playing song from ipod touch.(press the button on the wired remote 5.1 button)I checked reviews on amazon,review are high but i think,its good with pc.i do NOT recommend with any other things( ps3,lcd,plasma,i pod)"
4,Could be better,"They sound great,I love them other than the rear speakers should have a little longer wire for speakers"
4,only one problem,"the only thing I dont like about this system is that they dont include a splitter and extra cord,what i mean is I have to plug and swap from CPU to TV, just a small in convince,I can get the splitter at @#$ mart for around 15 bucks,other then that these rock, i live in a studio apt and its all i need, your not gonna shake the hood with the sub but it will do you well, sports sound great,and movies are 100% better do yourself a favor and get srs auido sand box software makes these into a whole diff system. I am very happy with purchase, and the shipping was right on point, was a day early actually. cant beat these for the price."
5,Astounding!,"The Speakers are incredible! It was a little annoying that there was no manual that came with it, but I'm not sure as to whether or not that's the seller or the companies fault. I would recommend theses speakers to anyone who loves music and the seller to anyone who wants the product delivered in a timely manner and in great condition."
4,"4 of 5, underwhelming for music","Luckily I bought this for gaming which it is phenomenal for. However for music they...well they almost suck. I am listening to some music right now and its like average at best. My Creative 2.1 speakers are better for music. Like I said I bought it for gaming, I use them for playing left 4 dead 2 and I almost feel like I am cheating because it works so well. I recommend for gamers!!"
5,Great Sound,Great clear sound using a 5.1 card. Love it in games and movies. The Sub is heavey which is a good size indicating it has a big speaker under its belt.
1,Started out great... Then down hill.,"Initially these speakers were terrific. When I first hooked them up it was incredible. But within about a week the center speaker shorted out and will kick in only occasionally. As frustrating as this was, I got over it. I use the speakers mostly to play music that I am writing on a MIDI program, and I started noticing that a certain note on the piano would make the speakers buzz. This got worse and worse, and gradually other notes near the original trouble note (D5) started making the speakers buzz. Within about two weeks since this problem started the speakers now buzz on every song, on every instrument. They sound like cheap phone's speakers now. My laptop itself has more defined sound at this point. What a waste of money. Very disappointed."
4,X-540 Review,"This speaker system is pretty awesome. It sounds great - the sub wolfer is awesome, and the Matrix button disperses the sound through the 5speakers very well. I definitely wouldn't compare it to a good pair of Bose speakers but I definitely think it's clear enough (play w/ the EQ if needed) and worth the money - easily."
4,5.1 are the best,I think you will enjoy the fact that these are surround sound and cost really cheap.
5,Best quality / price compromise,"If you have a limited budget, but you want good sound of course, just go with it! don't think about it twice!"
5,Fantastic product for the price.,"I was actually very pleased with these speakers. I don't consider myself an audiophile, so as for sound quality, I cannot be a great judge, but I can say that they don't sound bad at all. No cracking or hissing. They are capable of more then enough volume for my uses.They are solidly constructed and have the bonus of being convertible. Simply twisting the base will convert them to wall-mount. The center speaker being capable of mounting on a flat-screen monitor was also a plus.The small corded control box was also a nice feature so I no longer have to reach around to find controls. It also has a headphone jack built in which is a great feature to have at hand.All-in-all WELL worth the price.Shipping was a bit disappointing since it actually DOES fall under amazon's limit for weight for super saver shipping (as the actual weight on the shipping label suggested). But even with the 20-some-odd dollars shipping, it is still a value."
3,sufficient sound for computer system,"Though the x-540 system has sufficient sound for a small room environment, it lacks strength in the low end ranges. In spite of the sub-woofer and graphic equalizer enhancement controls, you will not be able achieve sharp booming bass from this system. The low end has tendency to be a little muddy. The EAX adjustment feature does provide some additional depth to the overall performance which is best utilized for gaming. However, as a music entertainment system attached to your computer, it will prove somewhat disappointing with it's low end limitations"
2,not much sound,"Not much power or sound with this system. Plus, it cost over 24 dollars to send back."
5,Simply Amazing,"I bought this system before 1 month and it has been playing quite well since I bought it. Installation was easy, just plug and play and sound is great. I think for the price, the product is really amazing. If you really love music like I do and don't want to spend too much on the system, this is the one for you. Not very hi-fi but enough to give you a kick while listening. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Decent sound for the price,"This system is not as powerful as I had expected (hence the 4 star rating), but it sounds good and clean. It is great for a small to medium sized room like an office or bedroom. Good overall buy for the money."
4,"Great little group of speakers. Not for the audiophile, but great for the rest of us.","Easy to install, not the loudest set of speakers, but they rock if you are close to them. I would suggest getting these if you need something that is a little better than 2.1 speakers or your headphones. Also, if you are looking for something to accommodate your movie watching on your computer this will work great. If you want to have your rear speakers far away I would get extensions for them. Have fun and enjoy a great cheap set of speakers."
5,Excellent,This is an amazing sound system for the price it is at. :) I enjoy it every day and I blast hard metal music and it sounds great.
4,Cheap Does Not Mean Bad!,"Logitech 970223-0403 X-540 5.1 Speaker System (Black)I bought this and was very surprised of the big sound bass and clarity this sound system has, it's cheap but don't hold that against this very good sound system it is Logitec and they take pride in what they make."
4,Good Buy,Sturdy and great sound appear to be durable. I really like the fact that the volume adjust is not on a speaker like other models but that it is a separate entity. Very please with the software and its many features. Overall this is a great buy for the price.
5,Awesome,"The product mentioned above has been an awesome upgrade to my prior 2.1 set-up. I live in an apartment & this speaker set rocks the entire place. I don't know how my neighbors feel, but I am very happy with this purchase and the quickness that it was delivered at the non-expedited shipping price. Great purchase I highly recommend it!"
4,"Great system, but the cords could be a little longer","I'm a college student and overall, I'd say this system is pretty great. The only problem is that the cords which extend to the rear speakers are a little short, so I either have to buy extensions to have cables going all over my floors. Overall, the sound quality is very good, and for the price I'd say it's a pretty good deal."
4,Computer Speakers,"These speakers are relatively modest in price, but seem to work quite well. Easy to install on my existing PCI sound card, and they have a good sound. I have been using them now for about 4 weeks."
5,Logitech,I purchased the Logitech X-540 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System with Subwoofer and was very please with how easy it is to set up.Also the matrix button makes it a good option for when you want or dont want the front and rear speakers to be on.Over all this productis really good for the price.
3,OK for the price,"This isn't an expensive surround system. The volume control has a switch to change between surround and stereo. Very handy because I use it for video editing. Some of my customers have surround and others don't so I can more or less hear what they'll hear - to a point. If you're an audiophile forget it however, the system, ""gets-er-done"" for day-to-day listening."
4,Good Product so far,I have had these speakers for about a month and they sound really good. I don't have a sound card that will play all of them...The center speaker doesn't work because my sound card only has a set up for 5 speakers; however the five that do play sound pretty good and the price was great. Guess I will be ordering a new sound card that has the 5.1 capabilty. I am sure Amazon will be competetive on price. I will have to check that out to see. Real good speakers...Great price when you take out the Amazon Chase card... you get thirty dollars off the sale price!!!
5,Still sounds great,These speakers still sound great after a year or more owning them. Wish it was more the 75 watts tho. /heh
2,"Umm, not so great.","Well, logitech is a very good company. But these speakers don't deliver te quality i am looking for. They look ""Old"". The sound is not that great. Think of it like this:-You are playing a movie in your room. You want the great, loud sound, but when you turn up the volume you get an unclear sound, kind of like in the old TV's.Not a good 5.1! Go for the G51, they will last longer and the quality is great!"
1,1 speaker system doesn't work. bad,there are 5 speaker systems.bue one of them doesn't work.i'm disappointed.
5,LOVE! LOVE!,"I have these speakers attached to my tv and the sound quality is simply awesome. Don't let the price fool you, they perform just as well if not better then most brands I have listen to in a higher price range. They also have these at Sams Club at a good price."
4,Good econo speaker set,"The X-540 is a good cheap speaker set for the computer. The biggest problem with the set is that it is under powered. The rear speakers are barely noticeable while the front is nice and loud. The speaker wires need to be longer as well, just little short for any distance. The looks are good and sounds great. Over all a good speaker set that gets basics done, but don't expect great things from it."
2,"Cheap price, cheap sound.","I am not a picky guy when it comes to audio, but these speakers are terrible. I boxed mine up & took them back to the store. The sound is fuzzy and static. They sound like they've been washed in a dishwasher. Completely unuseable! How on Earth they got such good reviews from others I don't understand. Avoid this junk product."
4,Logitech X-540 works fine.,"Not a bad system. Would like a bit more bass, but am happy with what it does for the money."
3,I had issues with one of the front speakers out put signal.,Decent looking and sounds great for my application. However one of the front speakers output stopped working after a week. I simply used a splitter to use the signal from the one that does work. The Subwoofer is nice for a PC system but not as a home theater pc set up as I am using mine. (So I added an addtional subwoofer). Thus after my modifications Im quite happy with the way my speakers sound. I can understand the subwoofer issue; but I hate the fact that front speaker out put stopped working for no reason.
4,Great sound for a great price,I purchased this speaker system as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is very happy with it and so far has no complaints. The sound is very clear and base is just right.
5,Awesome Speakers,"Sound quality is excellent. Lots of power at reasonable volumes. Center speaker ""clips"" on to your monitor. Remote, while wired, has a decently long cord (5') with all the right things on it - power, volume, bass, auto-bypass headphone jack, and matrix mode. Matrix mode is a nice one-touch solution for listening to music through all channels. Replaced a Dell 5.1 system that was junk. This was an excellent upgrade.Cons: This set definitely has a ""sweet spot"" - these are NOT meant to be maxed out and will distort at higher volumes. Leave the bass and volume knobs somewhere in the middle, and you'll get great sound. If you absolutely have to have your already-half-deaf ears blown out, buy a higher wattage."
3,Peach is bland and disppointing...........,"The peach pie filling was more disappointing than the cherry, the rhubarb and apple pie fillings. I used some apricot preserves (thin layer on bottom and top of the filling) to kick the turnovers up a notch. I cannot recommend the peach filling with the same 5-star review I gave the other fillings."
1,HATE IT,"YUCK!! I hate this popcorn!! The kernels are shriveled up and pitiful looking and it tastes like cardboard! Don't waste your money. I will never buy this again. However, 'Black Jewell Crimson', bought here at Amazon, is really good!!"
2,Sad and shallow,"I picked up this book hoping to find out something new about the world of prostitution. Unfortunately this book doesn't deliver. A sad broke woman, many sad sexually unfilled men who behave in controlling, sometimes agressive dangerous ways, and a madam who manipulatively calls the shots reveal nothing new about the topic. I was, however, repeatedly amazed at the author's minimizations of how this work was damaging and dangerous to her, not just physically and emotionally, but at a soul level. I didn't need for the author to experience redemption, but rather transformation of some sort beyond just changing the circumstances of her life from teaching & prostitution to marriage and kids. After I finished it, I was left feeling sad and depleted."
3,Slightly Disappointed...,"I purchased this book based on some reviews I had read on another site. The book itself, or at least the main point behind the book was well written, however the author seems to go off on these abstract tangents about the minds, thoughts, and behavior patterns of the other minor characters. It was kind of choppy to read about her life as a high dollar call girl and in the next chapter be bombarded with the woes of her drug addict 'acquaintance' with whom she occasionally did calls with.--who was just that, an acquaintance, who she trusted enough to loan money to and buy furniture for... Seemed a little far-fetched, almost farced at some points, and I usually will read a book cover to cover, but the choppiness made me skip past the droning lives of the minor characters. But this is just my opinion, I would recommend buying it used, and cheaper so if you don't like it, you aren't out that much money."
4,Not just a provocative account,"""Callgirl"" is more than titillating remembrances from a sordid past, but is instead a literate recollection of one woman's three-year foray into the oldest profession. Blunt and provocative, sometimes even funny, it can turn breathtakingly tender and often heartbreaking.Ms. Angell was more than just a ""hooker with a heart of gold,"" (a term the author disdains). Although the sex is recounted in graphic detail, clients benefited from her intelligence and warmth, as does the reader."
3,Verbose! Verbose! Verbose!,"The author uses too many fancy words in this book, may be to (over)compensate for the fact that she is not a native speaker of English. First half of the book is OK, but soon I realize she starts to flaunt/impose her own opinions and imaginations on her readers. The part about the Chinese girl is so far-fetched and behind the times. I stopped reading soon afterwards."
4,Worth a Read,"I have no idea how accurate are the details of the author's life, and I don't really care. Whether she teaches Social Anthropology in college or French in high school or whether or not she completed her Ph.D seems irrelevant after reading her story. I picked up this book for kicks--the sensational subject matter--and was surprised to find a brilliant, well written character study. How much of it is fiction and how much is nonfiction isn't much of an issue for me. The book reads well, the story is fascinating and the character that emerges seems full and real. Like the articles in Playboy, there's enough here to justify buying Callgirl. After skimming through the detailed sexy scenes, you'll enjoy a good read."
2,Was it wrong for me to think she'd be smarter?,"I'm an undergrad from a NON-Ivy League school who works in the sex industry, and I was shocked at the stupid decisions she made! Doing coke with customers, smoking crack, telling a male friend about her work and was shocked he tried to buy a service, unprotected oral, kissing all of her clients on the mouth, working for a pimp... It just goes to show a degree doesn't help in this business unless you plan on writing a self absorbed memoir. Her writing is so-so as well. A lot of it goes like this, ""I did this... and then I did that."" You get the feeling that she thinks she's very elegant and sharp, but really, she was only charged $200 and hour. For a classic book on sex work, read Xaviera Hollander's ""The Happy Hooker."" It's a little dated, but she actually has an interesting story to tell."
2,fascinating and forgettable,"This book was strange for me. I was fully engrossed while reading it. I liked it when I finished it, but a week later... I could not remember it at all. Only two things stand out:The narration, written in an offhand voice, can be wearing.There is a pervasive feeling of things not adding up. I didn't see any clear clues of lying/fiction. Then again, I didn't go back and look.I can't recommend this book, either to read or run away from.It is bland and forgettable, but does offer insight to a world most of us know little about. I read this before I had found out about the author's forced admission of ""doctoring the facts"". Had I know I may have read it differently."
3,Better than I expected......but not great,"When I perused this book in the library, I checked it out but didn't have high expectations. The format in which the book is written is a little bizarre (like an ongoing letter with chapters beginning and ending on the same page). Also, when telling a story she recalls too many details that simply aren't believable (what she was wearing, thinking, listening to on the radio). Anyhow, the stories of Jeanette's clients make the book interesting and keep you highly entertained. What she could have omitted were the frequent rants to justify why she was a prostitute. These continuously seem to pop up out of nowhere like she's trying to convince us that this lifestyle is moral and should be accepted. Also, she could've left out the all the information about the classes she taught. I believe anyone truly interested in this book just wants the juicy details and that's what she should have given us."
2,Widescreen????,"People are wondering why this movie is presented in Full-Screen format. The answer is simple...Widescreen movies weren't made until 1953. This movie was made in 1949. All movies made until 1953 were filmed in the 4:3 ratio. When TV came along, and used the same ratio for picture tubes, the movie execs came up with a wide format to lure back moviegoers.So, if you see a movie release on DVD, and it was made before 1953, don't look for it in wide screen..."
4,Wake of the Red Witch,1.It is a good movie.2.You have to like romance.3.You have to like this pair of actors.4.You need to like old movies.If all is true then buy this movie.
5,"Excellent, as advertised.","Given as gift, unable to document the actual performance of the product. The gift receiver did in fact like the product."
3,"Duke 1, Squid 0","WAKE OF THE RED WITCH has it all: An island full of half-naked Polynesian islanders, carved stone heads that stand twenty-feet high, a scuttled schooner laden with gold, the pearl god Tara-Tatu, breathless Euro chicks steaming it up beneath the vines and palm fronds on the RKO backlot, a succession of improbable flashbacks and John Wayne going mano-a-mano with a giant squid.This movie is a high seas, wooden-ships-and-iron-men costumer that spends most of its time tracking the tempest tossed romance `tween the Duke and Gail Russell, and the bitter rivalry between Wayne and the skullduggerous Luther Adler.WAKE OF THE RED WITCH is decently unmemorable in all respects, non-essential viewing for even the hardiest of John Wayne loyalists. It's filled with useless posturings and is based on a popular forgotten novel of the day. Others may find it riveting, but I spent most of my time trying to figure out how Wayne kept his toupee in place during the underwater scenes."
2,Flawed Period Piece,"Whoever was responsible for the screenplay in this movie did not know much about the law of the sea. There is a scene in which the ship is at sea and the owner is giving orders to the captain. Give me a break! When a ship is at sea, the captain is in absolute command and has absolutely responsibility for the conduct of all persons aboard the ship. All other persons who are on board are either crew or passenger, and both are under the control of the captain. No sensible owner would have it any other way. First of all, under the Harter Act, an owner who undertook to run the ship directly could incur severe legal liability for any misconduct that occurred, and secondly, such an action would undermine the captain in his dealings with the crew and the passengers. Any captain who would put up with such demeaning conduct is a wimp who should be deprived of his command."
3,Disappointing,I am a big Gatlin Brothers fan however I was a bit disappointed in this CD. 5 of the songs were already included on their other 2 Christmas CDs. The arrangements on some of the songs were very outdated and need updating. The Away in a Manager version was too childish. Their rendition of Sweet Baby Jesus is very heartwarming. I'd love it if they recorded a new CD with traditional Christmas songs.
2,"Classic, but dated, presentation","Chapters 1-7 of Stevenson's Elements, insofar as they went, were poetic descriptions of abstract power system principles. Nonetheless, Stevenson's masterpiece has been improved by the brilliant graphical explications in Grainger's recursion of it. Obviously, Grainger expands importantly on Stevenson with an additional 400 pages. Would that such an expensive text as Grainger simply include the CD with solutions to PROBLEMS, thus providing both equitable distribution of same in classrooms, and, outside the classroom, incentive and positive reinforcement to grapple with problems."
3,Essential Drumm & Bass 2,"Trax 4 (Soulcast - Jazzster)& 5 (Tyrone S - Night Shade) excellent, rest of album rather mediocre CD -1"
3,Very Average,"This book is good in many ways, giving a good overview of JSP's. It lets itself down by not providing enough information to get the ""in text"" examples working, and the downloadable examples simply don't work, without being tweaked, as often as they do.It is interesting to note that the book states that its examples run on Tomcat 4.1 (see page 2 Introduction), which does not support the JSP 2.0 or Servlet 2.4 specifications. (see http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html)It is a good beginning but I would not recommend it if you want the whole story in one place, or you need to work with examples to fully understand a topic."
4,A Non-dispensational View,This short work introduces the reader to another approach to the book of Revelation. It is refreshing because it is based upon a symbolic interpretation. Symbols from the Old Testatment appear in Revelation. Spilsbury uses them to present an interpretaion which views Revelation as not a book of detailed prophecy but one in which the symbols stand for the Church age and the struggle all Christians face. This short work does not fully cover all the questions it raises but opens up a new way of thinking. It is a fast read that left me wanting more.
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"...What can I say about Surf School? In the history of teen/twenty-something comedies, there may never before have been a movie as cliché as Surf School. Following the genre formula to a tee, there are a ton of cheesy jokes, ridiculous situations, and good looking people wearing very very little. Three guys, Three girls, a quirky old couple, a veteran comedy actor making a cameo, it has it all, and it's absolutely as cheesy as it gets. The movie isn't funny, the story isn't good, and the acting is very bland. It was pretty much everything I expected when I added it to my queue. Sometimes you add these comedies and you find a gem, like National Lampoon's Barely Legal. Other times you get a ""Surf School."" It really is just a waste of time."
2,Too much low humor ruined the movie.,"I like some of the actors in this so I checked it out. I gave it two stars but I would have given it more if they would have shot Harland Williams in the head in the first scene...I mean for real not for pretend. (okay, I'm not really advocating any physical harm to Mr. Williams, just that he never step in front of a camera again.) What a way to destroy a movie by including that type of very low humor."
2,"Good selection, but songs are in the short version","Good selection, some songs are quite good. But the best ones are even shorter than any 'radio version'. I didn't want or expect the chopped up version. I was dissapointed! I wnated songs at least full length, if not extended 12inch rmixes. Wait for a better selection. These Italo's are all a total hit or total miss. study before you decide. AN VA"
5,Italo heaven!,"Not to much to say really,only it is a totally awesome cd.A must have in your cd collection,one excellent song after another,BUY IT!."
4,Way Overpriced,"There's much duplication of material. Which figures, as this is a sequence of dates from the same tour.Each night, they played more or less the same songs, but would also spend about 30% of their time on ""improvs"", many of which are included here. The improvs tended to be loud as heck. Most of what this band played tended to be loud as heck. Wetton and Bruford were really going for the throat, as one can hear on the band's last two studio albums.The improvs aren't really very good musically. The music on here is such that big KC fans will want to hear it. But they did get their best moments and best ideas onto the studio albums, I must say."
5,This is one great Christmas CD,This is a great Christmas CD. A perfect addition to any christmas collection. The songs are a tradional mix with an up beat festive sound. Dolly rings in Holiday Cheer
5,Christmas with Dolly,This is a wonderful Christmas album. Dolly voice is so perfect for Christmas songs.
1,OK,"This is worth buying only if you've got spare cash. Otherwise you'd be better off buying any one of the other great albums Dolly has recorded. e.g. The Grass Is Blue It's too short and too Christmassy. Now, If Dolly were to write her own Christmas songs..."
5,"Breakwater, Where have you been??",Breakwater set the standard in the 70's. If you lived in the Tri State area and was in to music you knew Breakwater. I was a fan the first time I heard them live. Their energy was captivating and the music well before it's time. Amazon you have done it again. Thanks for putting this back out in CD form. If you love good music both CD's are a must!
5,Waited Forever for this!,"My best friend from high school introduced me to Breakwater's music back in the late 70's. She had the original album, and my uncle had the Splashdown 8-track tape. I've had both of these on CD for about 7 years now, but I had to order them from Japan. They were definitely worth the cost, and the wait. My favorites from both CDs are No Limits, Work it Out, You know I love you, Say you love me, Time, Love of My life.If you love true ""Old School"", you definitely need to add Breakwater's CDs to your collection."
1,Not worth it,"Just simply not worth it. A pain to install, and not any noticeable difference from standard plastic washers. Looks worse than regular plastic washers too."
5,Very Peaceful,"In an era when most artists seem to try to cram as many sampled sounds into a song as is possible, an artist who understands the beauty and power of a simple song is a rarity. These four tracks will stick in your head like nothing else. Best eight bucks you will spend on music, period.I saw Alexi at the Austin City Limits Festival and he was amazing."
5,Stunning stuff,"Alexi is at one with space in his songs. Some people try for a lifetime to write one single, honest song. Alexi has four of them on this EP. This is quite simply stunning. Buy this and keep it very safe."
4,I enjoyed it,"This album has only four songs, but I think it is rather well done. The songs are simple, but very well-composed and heartfelt.Orange Sky is by far the best song out of the four."
4,there's nothing wrong with space -- or this cd!,We were fortunate to hear Alexi Murdoch in San Francisco as a guest of Van Morrison. His voice has a timeless quality with the sound to cross many genres. We look forward to sharing his music for many years to come. The music on this CD is for anyone from 4 to 94. This CD has touched a chord that brought back many thoughts and memories and promised something new.
2,One song wonder...,"Orange Sky is a good song, but the rest of the album is forgettable. Other reviewers have commented about the similarity to Nick Drake -- not so, say I. Murdoch's lyrics lack the craft of Drake, and some of the lines where he has forced the lyric into a rhyme made me cringe. Very disappointing."
1,Stick with Nick Drake,"Don't waste your time with this. Yes, Murdoch bears a superficial resemblence to Nick Drake. But the mimicry rings false & hollow. Not to mention that the 4 songs in question aren't even close to the quality of Drake's leftovers."
5,Absolutely essential and USEFUL!,"This is one of the first things I bought when I found out I was pregnant. I had no idea then how incredibly well designed it was---it just felt right. It's the right combination of exactly what I'd be willing to cart around and at the same time be useful, simple, easy to clean, and on top of all that, LOOK GOOD! It works so well for small spaces and for those places that dont really have a changing area- it can slip in a bag, be tossed in the car or stroller----I love it and never go out without it. I would give it to any parent, it's outstanding."
3,Followed the Book to the Letter,"Actually this was a pretty good movie. It was based on the book of the same name. Ethel seems a lot less shrewish in the movie than in the book. Ethel seemed to always be in competition in the book with Jackie (although there is one part in the movie that Ethel does get nasty with Jackie)If you enjoyed the movie you would definitely like the book, much more detailed."
4,tear jerking,this movie is an excellent account of the kennedy family and is truly heart warming i totally recommend this movie unless your buying it to see what hollywood did to the assanation you do not see the assanation i would reccomend image of an assanation
4,It works great!,"It works great, but if you have a Chow-Chow or dog this size with this amount of hair, I would spend more money and a higher powered dryer."
3,PORTABLE BUT NOT POWERFUL,"I purchased this product because it was portable. This product is good for drying up your not-so-furry pals. Unfortunately, this product is not strong/powerful enough to dry my sheepdog. It took almost an hour to dry him up---quite tiring for both of us (even then he was still a little damp). I guess this product would be convenient to use if you want to get rid of excess water from your dog before coming in to the house. My other gripes about this product is that it is too noisey, however that might be the case for most air dryers."
5,best diaper creme ever!,"this creme smells nice, is not overly greasy and takes care of diaper rash lickety split! I have even used it on my own bug bites and it helps sooth the itch and redness, go figure!"
3,kindle review,"So far, this is the best book on mudras out there. I was happy to see it as an ebook so i could have it with me as a reference. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to use because it does not have page numbers or many links. My advice is to stay with the print copy until this is fixed."
1,Mudra numbers are lost in ebook version,"I returned the ebook version of this book. The mudras are referenced by number, but somehow the numbers are lost in the ebook version. There are chapters on ""Recharging Energy Reserves"", ""Solving Everyday Problems"" ,etc. but the recommended mudras are referenced by number. Since the numbers are not there I couldn't find the mudras I was interested in."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed reading the book, especially since I had started simultaneously on ""Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha"" by Swami Satyananda Saraswati. I would strongly recommend the latter if you want to learn aspects of Rajyoga/Hathyoga as they were intended to be.Gertrud's book barely touches the surface of this deep subject and at times deviates from the objective. Take, for example, this following para from page 96 as it relates to Kundalini Mudra and sexuality-""If a person feels no sexual desire, but feels good otherwise, then this is fine and normal. When the desire is there, it should be indulged, either with a partner or alone."" I suppose, that's not what you want to read in this book.That said, feel free to read a copy from the library, practise the mudras as you see fit, but understand that this is nowhere close to imbibing the essence of the subject."
4,Mudras for thought,"This books was reccommended to me by one of my Yoga teachers. She brought the book to class one day and proceded to read a section from it for our class. I am hard of hearing and told her that I would like to know the book's title so that I could get a copy. After the book arrived, I found that the many mudras discussed in it were overwhelming to me and so I asked my teacher if she could reccommend one or two that would be suitable for me to try. She asked me what my main areas of concern were. After telling her, she will now find certain ones that I can use. I am interested in what her ""assignment"" will be. This is the best method to follow as there are so many mudras described in this book, I did not know where to begin!"
3,Very little meat but a lot of potatoes.,Nothing earth shattering here. The mudras are well detailed and desribed but overall the book gave me the impression it was written for middle class women looking for something to do or be interested in. Worth having but don't expect any sort of advanced work here.
3,Good book with plenty of useful information,I received the book in good condition and have enjoyed the information presented there.
1,Garbage,"If I could give it half a star I would. I work at a store that plays this disc as background music and everytime this whiny biter starts to sing I immediatley push skip to save my customers the agony of his ""talent"". He even thinks he can rap! I dont like alot of typical pop music but please save yourself the trouble and know that this dude isnt expanding any musical horizons, he's just a surfboard on the ocean of great music....buy a Mos Def CD instead...."
1,Waiting for my turd to flush,"Jason Mraz has done nothing to me, unfortunately my secretary has; with her incessant need to hear this guy play his painfully simplistic accoustic songs from ""waiting for my rocket to come"" over and over and over again, every day at work. Jason Mraz lacks passion, aggression and creativity, plain and simple. Sadly I appear to be part of a dying few who care about such things; ""waiting for my rocket to come"" makes me wanna puke. I hold on to a frayed rope that tells me the new Fantomas will somehow enlighten people; I know I am kidding myself because people nowadays only care about what people look like, thus Jason Mraz."
4,Love it,"I recently discovered this guy, as to who he actually is. I didn't realize he was the one singing those songs I really liked on the radio when I saw a video of him and Colbie Colait (sp?). Then I started looking at his stuff on Amazon, listening to samples, and have now bought two of his CD's. This one has quite a few songs on it that I have heard on the radio not realizing who he was. The other songs I had never heard I like as well. His singing is so clear, and witty and fast at time, quite a talent."
5,Gets the Job Done Right!,"I ordered the CD, it arrived well within the allotted time frame, online it said great quality, and it was practically brand new. The seller description didn't exaggerate, and the price was fair. Good Deal!"
5,Great CD,"This is one of the best CD's I've bought in years. I bought because I was familiar with only one song but ended up liking all the songs. His music does not follow the current trends, so it was good 10 years ago, it's good now, and probably will remain good 10 years from now. He's got great vocals and the band is tight."
4,Great Debut Album,"This is a great debut album by Mraz, unfortunately for me, I had bought his live CD first. His live CD over-powers this CD. Albeit a great CD, there's another one that's better. Tonight, Not Again."
3,get the live songs man!,"Yeah, okay. Waiting for My Rocket to Come is OKAY. If you REALLY want Mraz go for his live stuff. MUCH BETTER. You really get a sense of what his style of music is. Reminds me of Ani Difranco and Howie Day. And his voice is so much better and realer live. His album sounds too fake and everythings all made ""perfect"" and too carefully produced. Honestly, if I heard this album w/o listening to his live stuff prior, I'd think he's nothing but another pop poser. And he definitely ISNT! He's amazing, with great music, great style, and great sounds. So, in short, GET HIS LIVE MUSIC!!!"
4,Has Become one of my favorites of the year!,"Like others, I too bought this album on the basis of the single ""The Remedy"". I was at the beach with a bunch of friends from high school at the time, and needed something I could listen to on the beach. I was thoroughly surprised when I listened to the whole cd, that every single song appealed to me (I expected to be pressing repeat on The Remedy the whole time). Whether enjoying a sunset or cruising down the road with your friends, this cd is definetly one to have. What's the sound like? John Mayer with some funk, some jazz, witty lyrics, a little bit of Dave Matthews, and quick delivery of the lyrics (kind of like Red Hot Chili Peppers)."
5,Jason's Rocket Has Come In!!,What a great album!! My favorite song is You and I. Great lyrics! And the Remedy is my second favorite. I would have to agree that I love is live performances better but I'm not complaining. Great voice!!! Can't wait for him to come to the Gorge again!!
2,What happened in the studio,After listening to a couple of tracks I can't beleive what I heard. Is this really the Jason Mraz I have come to love. This cd does not do him justice. I would suggest going jasonmraz.com and buying live at Java Joe's. I agree with Jesse Langham review. I am left wondering what did the industry do with Jason.
5,All-round stunning album!!,"To put it concisely: Jason Mraz has the most heart-warming and 'human' of voices - an album definitely worth buying!! Endorsed by singer/song-writer, Jewel, you can instantly tell that this guy must ooze talent. Boy does he do that. Despite being compared to John Mayer, his music still conveys a unique and refreshing style, in particular 'You And I Both' is song which demonstrates that fresh sound, an instant hook.If you like the acoustic sound of John Mayer, you're going to love the sound of Jason Mraz. The sheer effort that's put into his music compells me to come back to this album. His voice perpetuates its own vibe - it creates its own rhythms and sticks in ones mind for a long time. A must get."
5,Pretty darned addictive,"I have to admit, I was not impressed with his first single,""The Remedy."" It screamed pop phenom. But then I heard ""You and I Both"" and absolutely had to get this album. It's full of self deprecating songs that make fun of Mraz's ""hick"" roots and are just all around fun. At times, he sounds as though he should be on Broadway with his lyrical music that it's just astounding.I highly recommend this album if you liked the first three singles. They pretty much give you the perfect idea of how the whole album sounds."
5,The voice of a million smiles,"This kid is one of the finest singer songwriters of the new generation. Mraz's style is one that melds the greats together then adds his own miracle; his voice. His voice is so crystal and perfectly pitched, it's really like butter. The music itself is simple and beautifully poetic. This kid is fantastic. Check out this album and go see him live."
3,Unusual collection on songs...,"I guess I'm going against the majority by giving this disc three stars. After listening to it twice, I am still having trouble determining where Jason Mraz got his influences from. The songs on the disc are all over the place, not that variety is a bad thing, but there is definitely not a theme. I bought the disc on the merit of ""Remedy"" alone. The best songs on the disc are ""Remedy"", ""Tonight, Not Again"" and ""Too Much Food"", which was actually my favorite. The rest of the songs are not bad, but they don't shine.Since is the debut disc by Jason Mraz, Elektra/Asylum records have priced it [accordingly], definitely worth the money. Any more and I would have to reconsider. As for Grammys, I do not see any in the future."
5,Amazing.,"I've been a fan of Mraz for a couple years now and I've had the privilege of hearing his music evolve... Just when I thought he could never sound more perfect, he'd do something else to amaze me. If you've never heard his angelic voice and haunting tunes, I'm tellin' ya, you're missing out BIGTIME! We old-school fans were a bit nervous that a major-label recording would take away from the improv/comedy feel that makes a Mraz live show or album so special, but they did good. Just keep in mind, this is like a tiny little morsel they tossed out to the general public. You won't reach the cream filling until you see the live show. Now, what are you waiting for? Buy it!"
5,"right now, my favourite.","this man is amazing. unfortunately, some of his best songs are NOT on this album and i'm eagerly awaiting another release. however, many good songs are included, such as ""on love, in sadness"" and ""curbside prophet"". his voice is unique, and strangely melodic. combine this with a grasp of immensely poetic lyrics, and a range of style from melancholic to downright toe-tapping, this album can be enjoyed by ... nearly everyone. i recommend it most heartily. i also recommend ""the dream life of rand mcnally"", ""0% interest"", and ""sleeping to dream"" by the same artist. i think you can find them at his website - www.jasonmraz.com."
4,A Cut Above Average,"If you listen to Top 40 radio, you've probably heard the Remedy by now, but the reason to buy this album is for the songs that won't make it to Top 40 radio, but leave you thinking about them for a while. A couple that got me: Track #7 -- ""hold still for the analytical knife/you're about to get cut up, cut down..."" great line. Track #11: the Boy's Gone Home's got this great Brazilian vibe -- very sexy...Curbside Prophet's strong, and so are many of the other tracks on this album.I only give 5 stars to classics, but this is a really strong album, better than John Mayer (I have both), and kind of in the tradition of Paul Simon rather than McCartney I'd say.Besides, Mraz is a homeboy Virginian transplanted to California -- you know he's got to have an eclectic and interesting mix going on inside that lyrical head of his.This is a very good album to own. Get it."
2,over produced,I heard Mraz on a sunday morning tv program with a stand up bass and percussionist. I was quite impressed with his vocal talents and the raw power of the songs. This CD is not that musican I heard. I can't believe the praise on this CD and the high ratings. It is over produced pop and not very good at that. The young man should find himself another producer and cut loose any advise to clean up his sound. I don't know what the folks that are rating this CD are getting excited about as I read and disagreed with most of the reviews.I will say that this young man has talent and I would most likely buy his next attempt. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't bought this one do the same.
2,Jason Mraz review,"I loved the remedy, and I thought the the c.d. would be fabulous based on it. Turns out the c.d. was not that good. The remedy was the best song and the others were slow and boring. I was extremely disappointed. I expected much better. I would save my money or listen to all the songs on the c.d. before buying. Humph! Signed Ashley!"
2,John Mayer has nothing to worry about!!,"I love John Mayer's ""Room For Squares"", so I thought I'd give this a try as well. While John's debut has a ""Dave Matthews but better"" sound, Jason's debut is sort of a folk-type album. Now, why they get compared to each other a lot is beyond me. But the fact of the matter is that they do get compared. Now Jason's folk sound would be good if most of the songs weren't either sleep inducing (The Boy's Gone, Absolutely Zero), or just straight up silly (Too Much Food, Curbside Prophet). Sorry to all you die hard fans, but this just isn't cutting it for me. Sure, I admit that I like ""The Remedy"", ""Sleep All Day"", and ""On Love, In Sadness"", but the rest is just a waste! Like the review title says, John Mayer shouldn't really worry about any competition with this guy! Save your hard earned dollars for John Mayer's album instead!! When are more of these so-called ""real"" artists going to realize that ""real"" doesn't always have to equal painfully dull?!"
2,"shippy bopdopdadippitydo, this is what he sounds like","This is one of the most disappointing cd's i can remember in awhile. I heard so many rave reviews about this artist, even heard that damn remedy song on the radio and wasn't impressed. I figured that the hype on him must be good and they just chose the worst song on the album for the single, which is so often the case. Man, was i wrong, this album did nothing for me, from the stupid freestyle vocals, to the simple guitars. The only reason i give it two stars is because unfortunately this is better than 80% of the music out there right now, like justin timberlake, staind, and the god awful group simple plan aka TRL. At least this guy writes and plays his own music, he has some talent, i just think he sounds annoying!"
2,A Message to Jason,"The one time my friend and I caught his live show, we were put through hours or boring chat from Mr. Mraz. People come to hear you sing Jason, not jabber on muchadoaboutnothing. I'm not sure if he was drunk, or other, but his sets were boring and it made me realize so is his music. Good voice, but learn to take it more seriously."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting this album to be along the lines of John Mayer (I love John Mayer), but I was rather disappointed when I began to skip songs on the CD. The singles and a few other songs are good, but the rest of the CD is awful. Unfortunately I ended up buying the CD for a couple songs, I can't listen to the entire CD (because I skip the awful songs), and this is a prime example of why people began downloading music online. I would not recommend buying this album."
1,Yuck,"This cd is horrible and overrated. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Don't waste your money."
1,"Oh look, something to click 'NO' at!!","Haha. Yes I've heard this album. It's not bad, and the guy's original. I just thought I'd make my own comparison. Everybody else stated their opinion, which is a good thing to do (most of the time), so I'll state mine. There is no conceivable way Mraz is superior to Mayer, vocally or instrumentally, period. That's all I wanted to do with this ""review"". This album in and of itself is definitley not bad whatsoever. But if I put five stars, would you have read?? Don't think so. One star makes it juicy =) Now lets see how many times we can click the 'no' button before mama calls us in for supper."
1,it's Open Mic night at the Student Lounge!,"uh-oh, here's comes another psuedo-talented fratboy from his college's open mic ""makin' it big""...who's this guy, the next Chester J. Mayer or whatever his name is?...this music is just awful, how could this not make anyone wretch? so much cheese it'll make you lactose intolerent from one listen...no wonder i hate college so much, groan..."
3,"I'm waiting, too.","The lead single -- ""The Remedy (I Won't Worry)"" -- is what hooked me and is unfortunately the album's highest peak. It has a Simply Red, late-80s VH1 pop feel to it that I dig. I liked ""Too Much Food,"" but I found the rest of the album to be too pedestrian and middle-of-the-road to give much more merit. Many of the tunes sound like re-workings of the lead in different veins and lyrical flourishes. The ballads didn't do it for me. They didn't feel genuine to me. The songs' titles are cute and semi-clever, but under the facade there isn't much substance. Knowing the record industry, there'll probably be a re-release of this with some extra material. Overall, he's promising, but I don't feel that he has a distinguishable artistic voice on this debut -- maybe sophmore year."
4,How did I miss this?!,"This album came out late 2002 and I just heard ""You & I Both"" late '03/early '04. Finally bought it Saturday and can't believe how I missed it. This is a very good suprise of an album. Though it does get a tad bit repetitive, it doesn't distract from Mraz's obvious amount of talent. Like Tweet's ""Southern Hummingbird"", this is another 2002 album that obviously got very little attention for no reason."
1,This is NOT Jason Mraz,"I was introduced to Jason Mraz through his ""Live @ Java Joes"" album and I haven't stopped listening since. He is an electric, mad-scatting vocal and musical prodigy and I knew he was going to be big.I eagerly awaited his Electra release and when I listened to it the first time, I thought I must have the wrong album.This CD is remarkably slow paced, low energy. His signature vocal styles have been cut out. His lovable and talented percussionist, Toca was inaudible and drowned in cheesy synth sounds and horrible drum machines. The only thing that sounded like Mraz was the title track. The rest were a big let down.I love Mraz's music and want other people to hear it; But not this. This is obviously the offspring of an overbearing producer trying to put out radio tracks for the yuppie pop music crowd. If you want to hear Mraz, go to his website and Order ""Live @ Java Joes."" ... You will not be disappointed, unless you buy this album."
4,"Suggest you buy the ""Live"" CD","""Rocket"" is pretty good, but I would suggest you go to his website and buy the ""live"" CD, it is 100% better!! As I found out on ""sleep all day"" he gives homage to the great Etta James' ""At Last"" I hate to say it Etta, but he gives ya a run for your money here. It's DELICIOUS!!"
3,nothing like it could have been,"I fell in love with Jason's music a few months ago when I accidently stumbled upon his website. There I 'd downloaded ""So Unusual"" I believe. This guy was amazing! His voice, the guitar, the percussion all blended into an excelent musical, yet amazingly fun, experience. When I read he was going to put out a full length studio album I ordered it the moment I could. I HAD to have it. What a bummer. This was nothing like the songs I'd heard. I'm not saying it's a bad album, but if you have heard this man live with Toca the percussionist (""The 6th member of the Jackson Five"") you'll be dissapointed in the talent wasted."
4,What's up with M-R-A-Z?!,"I found this CD and recognized the name Jason Mraz as the opening act for Chantal Kreviazuk's Canadian Tour. I was vaguely familiar with 'The Remedy' so I decided to go ahead and pick up the CD. Much to my surprise, and a couple listens, it turned out to be a great CD! The opening song 'You And I Both' caught my ear right away followed by the reggae tinged 'I'll Do Anything'. Listen for the ending for 'Curbside Prophet'. My favourite part of the song ""Hey Hey! Something's different in my world today. They changed my traffic signs to a bright yellow."" Pay close attention to Track 9, 'On Love, In Sadness', an upbeat amazing song that will attach itself to you and make you wanna listen to that one song on repeat over and over. Great CD!"
5,I'll take my music with a side of Mraz.,"Great artist. catchy songs, espically sleep all day and curbside prophet. Any Dave or John Mayer fans will absolutly love this CD."
3,wasn't as good as i expected,this is a good cd but i thought it be much better with songs like the remedy i figured this cd would be great but the rest of the cd sounded the same but not as good as the remedy
5,Jason Mraz is my fave singer/song-writer,"I had every Jason Mraz CD except this one. When I saw that I could buy it for $.99 plus shipping, I just had to try it. I wish I had bought it sooner. Shipping was fast and condition of used CD was near perfect."
5,Wow,"I listened to this kid because we used to live in the same neighborhood - ..., I should support him, right?? He's AMAZING. No suckage here. This CD has a song for every mood on it, it makes me laugh and cry and grin from ear to ear - and it's GREAT for road trips! I drive a lot, if I can't listen to a CD on 95, I don't listen to it again. This one hasn't left my CD player since I got it, it even comes in to work with me! His lyrics are infectious and fun - his skatting is great - and while I do enjoy his live stuff better, you can't blame Elektra for wanting him to be *barely* poppy and safe in his first album. I can't wait for the second one - I know it will blow this one away (and all those who think John Mayer is better :-D)."
4,Excellent,"This CD is worth every cent of your money. Songs 1,2,3,5,6,and 7 are my favorite songs. Songs 3 and 5 sound a lot alike but their both good songs. Clever lyrics, and a nice attitude. It's nice to know that people with hit songs like Jason Mraz, John Mayer,Vanessa Carlton,and Dave Matthews are musicians that not only sing but can play instruments are still around. People like Justin Timberlake scare me.So Buy this CD! I highly recommend it."
1,Waiting for a rocket to come...and blow his ass away!,"Okay. I love the song 'The Remedy (I Won't Worry)'. The song 'You and I Both' is alright. It just goes downhill after that. I mean...STRAIGHT down. I bought this CD, listened to it ONE TIME, most of the songs I couldn't even get half-way through without skipping to the next, and sold it in the Amazon.com Marketplace the same day, for fear of it's wretchedness infecting my good CDs by being in the same collection. lol...The melodies are pretty much non-existent, the songs are very boring. The Remedy and You & I Both sound SO out of place it's hysterical. Bottom Line: If you're curious, buy it on Amazon.com used first, instead of blowing the full 15 bux at a record store"
3,Keep on waiting...,"This is a very average CD. Moreover, to compare Jason Mraz to the likes of Dave Matthews, Neil Finn or John Mayer is a real stretch of the truth. Mraz has a very poppy, sugar coated sound and he really fails to deliver the sort of meaningful, intelligent musical talent that you'd expect from the likes of the other musicians he has been banded with. 'Waiting for my Rocket to Come' has a very disjointed feel, and you really get the impression that Mraz is trying too hard, too early in his musical career to be too many musicians at once. His blend of reggae, funk, pop and rock really does not leave you satisfied and unfortunately Jason Mraz really has failed lyrically to find anything interesting to sing about. There are a few nice tracks to listen to, but altogether a disappointing effort."
5,One of my favorites,"Jason Mraz is talented and this is an excellent. If you like Howie Day, Maroon 5, Duncan Sheik, etc. you will love this CD."
4,i thought it was gonna be.......OMG IT ROCKS!,"When i saw Jason Mraz's music video for his first single ""The Remedy"" i was like. ""ok...this is cool"" but as i saw it more and more i started to like it even more and more...so i got the CD, i listened to it, and like the video, i was like ""this is ok..."" but i listened to it more and more, and i started to like it a lot more. its not my favorite CD, but its a cool cd. i recommend it..."
4,Jason Mraz-waiting for my rocket,"I got Jason's cd when I kept hearing his first single on the radio (the remedy). It sounded awsome so I got it, I listen to the cd, and wow it is awomse! my god if you dont have it yet get it now! ok well jason sings about all this cool stuff. like being a kinda like a bum. and all about his life. his music is differnet from anything i have heard before. there is pop, jazz, rap, hip hop, flok, country, but i dont know where this cd, falls into. it is its own caterogry. there is probally no way of difining it really....it is defintly a new kind of music.SO IF YOU DONT HAVE IT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!"
1,Doesnt Cut It,"With so-called 'witty' lyrics, it just doesn't cut it, his first single 'the remedy' which is obviously a crowd pleaser, and possibly the only song on his debut album that makes you want to buy the cd isnt worth it. although he does have talent i dont think you should buy this cd, maybe wait for the second."
1,One man... two songs...,"... and I only like one of them. This album is a boring and derivative waste of time. It would have put me to sleep if it didn't annoy me so much. I bought it because I thought ""The Remedy"" was clever. It doesn't seem so clever now that I know half the songs on the album are almost exactly the same - stream-of-consciousness words pulled from commercials and the media, and a warbly up-and-down melody that gets old really fast. The other half consists of whiny, twangy navel-gazing that I find unlistenable. When Mraz' rocket comes, I hope for his sake and mine that it brings some new ideas."
2,I wanna know where it started from,"Considering Mraz' unmatched voice, songwriting depth, incredible taste and unique style, it's disappointing to hear something so average. Tracks 2 and 9 are standouts, as I expect his follow-up to be. This is just kinda average, though."
3,"strong start, with overall mixed results......","Most of you probably know Jason Mraz best for his song, ""The Remedy (I Won't Worry),"" which got considerable airplay, upon the debut of this, his first album, back in 2003. There is good reason for that, in my estimation. It is an undeniably catchy tune, blends quirky lyrics with upbeat guitar riffs and a Mraz's peppy vocals. ""You and I Both"" (track #1) is an example of when this pattern works well, and it is, both, melodious and quite beautiful, actually.Unfortunately, the charm of the music that follows the pattern of songs, on this album, wears off MIGHTY fast. Mraz just can't coast through the depth of his CD on his easy-going frat boy charm, and, ultimately, each cut sounds the same as its predecessor. But, to Mraz's credit, his sound is accessible, radio friendly and surprisingly optimistic, in contrast to more desparaging and depressing rock, frequently heard in rotation, on Top 40 charts today."
5,Huge Fan,"I like this CD... it is, in and of itself, a work of art. Having said that, I am very much looking forward to the next CD due out in July in hopes that more of jason's onstage presence will be revealed in digital format. My husband gave me tickets to Alanis M's unplugged accustic concert in Phily and we went. We were about to decide that running late was no big deal, andI am VERY glad that we decided not to be rude to the openning act and skip it. We sat down, saw Mr.A-Z in lifesize letters on the stage, settled in for what we figured would be mediocre at betst performace from a local song and dance man. I was taken aback by this young man and his partner Dennis Toca. I dont take the following statement lightly, but this kid outsang Ms. M by a long shot. Alanis was great, but Jason made our night. Give me Jason and Dennis with a guitar a symbol and a drum anyday... they are simply amazing....You wont regret buying this one Jason is phenominal... keep your eyes out for the next one too."
5,The rocket they call Mraz,"Everyone listen up, The album waiting for my rocket to come is a vessel that is filled with heartache, love, growth, dreams, and all around talent that is heading no where but up the charts. When you buy this album you will automatically lose yourself in his voice, wit, and power that can only be described as Mraz. You can choose from a palette of tracks such as ""Curbside Prophet"" which gives off an aroma of quick wit somewhat similar to the Barenaked Ladies. Or you could be struck in the chest with a bat engraved by Mraz and listen to ""You and I both"", which is a song about growth and space from that someone, who used to be, someone you shared secrets and cigarettes with. I would like to write a review on all the songs but how about you just pick it up and see for yourself. Overall this album is a sign of hope in the shape of a rocket."
5,"*Witty, Moving, Ingenious, and Relaxing*","The handsome Jason Mraz does it for me in more than one way on Waiting for My Rocket to Come! His nostalgic, comedic, and innovative beats not only have me singing and smiling but it sends me to a place of relaxation and euphoria. This CD's West Coast, casual style, makes it perfect for the car, reading, or lazing around on the sand. Don't just pick up this CD, be sure to get all of Mraz's recordings and catch the stud in person! You will surely be moved by his melodic, body swaying, and swoons if not by his quirky, yet captivating, unconventional, good looks!"
5,Waiting for my rocket to come no more!!!,"hey mista mraz and mista toca (and everybody else reading this),have to say that i am completely impressed by the cd! had my doubts about ""produced"" versions of the songs ive heard live so many times, but i guess i was taught a lesson ;)excellent, love every song, love the new parts of songs i already knew, love the pace and the vibes of the cd, hard to not move around to it.played the cd to a number of people already and they all wanna buy it, meet you guys, bear your kids etc.whoever is used to jason and toca's shows @ javajoes, SD - go and buy the CD! everybody else: buy it even more!"
4,Can't get Mraz out of my head....,"As a typical Dave Matthews/John Mayer/ Howie Day fan, I thought Jason Mraz would just be another wanna-be. But after purchasing his live album, and ""Waiting for My Rocket to Come,"" I find myself so taken with his beats, unique rhythms, lyrics, and sound that I can't seem to get his songs out of my head. I definitely recommend this CD, and check out his first ""Live"" album as well."
3,tai chi chair VIDEO/DVD,"there is another tai chi chair, which isvideo... both VHS and DVD on AMAZON by cindy MASON,but its hard to find forsome reason. it is ASIN B0002TJHBW (DVD)and ASIN B0002TSJHC6 (VHS)... it is beingused at stanford health library, mass general,and several companies have now gotten it fortheir employees... its just been released.and that may be why amazon doesn't have a lotof links yet, although it is in their stock...i think this bookis good in that it helps fill in knowledge,but if you are visual like i am, you mightwant to add the video by Mason."
5,Excellent resource for excercising at home,"Out Of Balance? Be a Bounce Back Person""I loved Cynthia's book on Healing T'ai Chi. In the way of most coincidences, my physical therapist had suggested I start doing T'ai Chi to gain flexibility and endurance. Looking locally, I could not find a class that was convenient and then I found the exact book that taught how to do the moves. Cynthia explains every move and meaning so that the average person can readily understand and do the exercises. If you are looking for a manual and motivation to learn this life-extending skill, this is it. You will be so glad you bought the book and followed the instructions.""Judy H. Wright, Empowerment Coach[...]"
4,Work for typical size screwdriver - wish Gladiator had a mixed size set or alternative options,"Pros:Works as expected for most screwdriversEasy to install/move as neededPriced rightCons:As the title says - they are one size only. Unless I'm missing it, these are the only hook options from Gladiator. I wish they had some more options. That is probably the biggest negative of the Gladiator system - you are stuck with whatever they think is the right option."
1,"Not a good size loop, if I only knew in advance.","The loop hooks are not large enough for chisels, coated plier/cutter handles, nut drivers. Basically anything larger than standard a screwdriver's shaft does NOT fit in the hanger.Very limited usage for a pricey item."
4,"Lots of beauty, a few beasts","I got this one solely for Dalene Kurtis and was surprised by the other beautiful models including, Heather Spytek (absolutely breathtaking face), Shanna Moakler, Christi Shake, Stephanie Heinrich, Lindsey Voulo, and Jennifer Walcott (except for her phony funbags). There were only two girls I felt had no right to call themselves playmates, Tina Jordan (yuck, looks like a tired-eyed pornstar) and Heather Carolin (redheads scare me sometimes). The others that I haven't mentioned were good looking but as good as the few at the beginning. Dalene Kurtis' sequence was kind of lame but she is still pretty. And while I would have liked to have seen Heather Spytek from further away she was still nice to look at, most of the shots in her intro sequence are very close-up so you don't to see the whole package. Apart from those few gripes this is a definate addition to any collection."
1,All filler and no action from Playboy... imagine that.,"Sure, the Playboy 2003 Video Calendar is a slick production but fails to please this veiwer. As is the problem with Playboy's videos the company just doesn't want to let fans see ""all"" of their favorite playmates. Now, I'm not talking about sleazy spread shots, but the lack of detailed ""kitty"" shots that show what each centerfold has is very frustrating. If you like breast shots, then pick it up. However, if you wish to see what the playmates have under[neath] keep dreaming. If you want to see decent centerfold videos try DreamGirls or CandyGirl Video, not this [weak] music video art wanna-be tripe."
3,Good show,"This video is full of some of the hottest women in the world (Tina Jordan, Dalene Kurtis, Christi Shake, etc). Tina Jordan in particular needs her own video. This does lack quality butt shots and some of the spreads are decent at best. Overall, Playboy has done better but this is still a good buy."
4,Worthy,"If you enjoyed these stunning Playmates in their centerfolds then without a thought you will as well also enjoy this Playmate Video Calendar very much. Heather Spytek is memorizing, if you weren't already a fan, you will become one! This Video includes 12 Playboy Centerfolds which are Heather Spytek,Tina Jordan,Shanna Moakler,Christi Shake,Dalene Kurtis,Lauren Anderson,Stephanie Heinrich,Lindsey Vuolo,Nicole Narain,Kimberly Stanfield,Jennifer Walcott,Heather Carolin. Sure enough if you are a fan of these mentioned Playmates than you shall enjoy it."
4,An average CD with a few shining stars,"This is by far Julie's weakest effort. Overall, the song selection is good, but the arrangements just don't mesh well with Julie's singing.What makes this CD worth the money are the few gems on here, expecially 'What are you doing the rest of your life?, which itself is worth buying this CD for. No one who has recorded this song can touch her version(although Sinatra's is a close second)."
3,It's okay,"Quite drying for my hair although it says it's a conditioning shampoo. However, the only issue I had was in shipping that the lid was not secure and there was a small part of product that had escaped. Not sufficient to return, and I'm sure a one-off shipping error."
2,messy,Did not care for this product. Came opened and spilled all over package.Tryed a little of left over. Did not enhance highlights. Just made hair color run together.
5,Silver & Proud!,"I am an african american female and i too have decided to go gray. After I finally decided to give up coloring and relaxing my hair I have gone ""au natural"". I went to a professional and had a sharp cut done. My stylist recommended Clairol Shimmering Lights Shampoo, because I too was experiencing yellow in my hair. The shampoo worked wonders! My silver hair is shiny and striking, I'm sticking with it."
2,Does what it says but...,"Let me start by saying I have never colored my hair. My first white hairs started appearing when I was 16 and I didn't want to become a slave to the salon.White hair, and mine is snow white, has no pigment so it shows everything it absorbs. When mine started turning yellow at the top I had to do something so I tried this shampoo.It did remove the yellow (or color-neutralize?, I'm not sure it actually removed it) in just a couple of shampoos. So it does what it says but the smell is very strong. I have allergic asthma and the smell literally takes my breath away. It also lingers in your hair for days.I will probably use it once a week or so for maintenance but not as an every time shampoo. The smell is really off-putting. Also, be sure to rinse both your hair and your tub well. I do have some purple staining in my tub."
5,gets rid of brassiness!,"I had noticed that my highlights had started to take on a brassiness, so I asked my hairdresser what we could do about it, and she recommended this shampoo. It worked really well! I used it once or twice a week and it kept my highlights looking the way they should and got rid of the brassiness. It didn't stain my hands, but it did leave a slight tint around my cuticles. If you rinse it out all the way it won't harm your towels, and make sure you rinse it from the sides of your shower while you let it set for a minute, or it will leave a lavender streak. She told me not to use it too much because it can give your hair a purplish cast, so I didn't-and I was very pleased with the results!"
3,not a dramatic difference at all,"this shampoo will help give your blonde a bit more grey with its purple base color but it is nothing very dramatic or complete noticeable however it will do the job better than a normal shampoo. my product came unscrewed in the box so there was a purple mess inside and when i contacted the seller they basically said it wasnt their problem and to contact amazon, so not a great company and i will be leaving a seller review as well. luckily amazon did give me a refund."
5,great shampoo,"I really like this shampoo. Most conditioning shampoos leave my hair oily. This one is just the right amount ofconditioning, and leaves my hair very shiny and managable."
4,Clairol Shimmer Lights,Product received as advertised and at the correct price. Service is good and would purchase again from the same source.
1,WARNING: DO NOT USE! Turned my blonde hair purple :(,"My hairdresser suggested I use this product on my bleach blonde hair to eliminate some of the brassy yellow tones. I went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner w/o even thinking about reading some reviews first. Well, I washed and conditioned my hair with it, and I ended up with purple highlights! So not only did I spend $20 on the shampoo and conditioner, I now also have to spend money to have my hair recolored. What I don't understand is that it says right on the label ""will not leave residue, no patch test required"". All I have to say to that is yeah, ok. Thanks Clairol!"
5,"Fragrant, and it works!","I bought this on the recommendation of a friend of mine with beautiful, shiny, gray hair, and it's working very well for me, because I too now have shiny gray hair! I am on well water, which was making my hair turn yellow, but now new hair growing in stays gray or white and does not turn yellow."
1,Skip this product,"The product came in the mail with the top loose and purple shampoo everywhere. It would have been a good idea to tape the top. It also smells like ""old lady"" shampoo. It really is a gross smell that stays with your hair for days. The instructions also say to wash, rinse and repeat, so you end up using twice as much product. This turned my platinum hair grey in several areas. I bought the biggest size, because this is a staple for blondes, and ended up throwing it out after just 5 uses. I would highly recommend investing in the Unite Blonda Shampoo instead. It smells amazing, you only leave it on for 45 seconds and it is less drying than this product- truly the Unite is worth the money. Skip the Shimmer Lights completely."
1,Followed directions but it does not work at all,I have used this 6 times and have followed all the directions and advice. I have tried leaving it on my hair longer but it is not taking the brassiness away at all. I have dark brown hair with blond highlights and it has not improved at all. It was a huge waste of money.
1,horrible smell!,"I thought the smell would fade, but after suffering a day through it, I washed my hair that night because the smell would've kept me awake. It also made my scalp itch.Threw away a full bottle."
1,Yucky product,"My hairstylist recommended this after I decided to go gray. I have beautiful white hair. After quite a search, I finally bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has a dark purple color and very thick, gloppy texture. Both shampoo and conditioner have an annoying, cheap fragrance. Using the product left my hair dry and kind of dull gray.It's very pricey. Definitely NOT recommended."
3,its okay.,"this certainly does have a lot of purple dye in it, so it is more purple than other toning products I've used. It seems to work okay but to be honest I hate how it smells. I wont buy this again solely for that reason. I tried to dye my hair white, and part of it got white but part of it stayed a light yellowy blonde. I hoped this would take the yellow out, but it didn't do much for the yellow, but it did manage to tint the lighter parts purple. I finally purchased an ""anti brass"" hair dye, which finally did the trick. oh right and the bottle was smaller than I Was expecting.. so read the description carefully so you dont end up surprised by what your ordering. I used this in conjunction with the conditioner which also has the same terrible smell, and unfortunately it didn't go away after I rinsed it out. I actually received comments from others that my shampoo was very strong smelling."
1,Blue Hair,"This product will remove the yellow; problem is gray hair takes on the blue properties. If you want white hair, don't use this one it turns the hair blue."
4,This does work,"I highlighted my hair with bleach and didn't leave it on long enough, my hair was orange. After using this it takes out the brassiness, not making my hair that much more blond but much less orange. I maybe not as good if your hair is white blonde but good for a regular warm blonde. Def worth the try and cheap!"
4,Good product - packaging issues.,"When i received this, some of the shampoo had leaked but luckily it was in a sealed bag. Still somewhat annoying to clean up. The product works nicely though."
1,Dried out my hair,"This shampoo is horrible. I have medium blond hair and thought I would try this to take out the brassiness. It left my hair feeling very dry and brittle and the smell is also very bad. Also, it did not seem to take out any of the brassiness. I would not recommend."
3,"Works well on platinum hair, but..","Worked great for the platinum streaks in my hair and helped to maintain color, but the majority of my blond hair (which has a brassy tone to it) actually became more brassy and dark with each use!! I was hoping this product would remove the brass from my hair, but it didn't do that, quite the opposite in fact. If the day ever comes where I go completely platinum, I would definitely use this shampoo.Until then, I wouldn't recommend this shampoo to people trying to fix their brassy tone."
1,HORRIBLE!! DO NOT USE!!!,I just used this shampoo and conditioner and my hair is BLUE!!! I am mortified!! I will call my hairdresser in the morning. Just tried to shampoo it out with another regular shampoo but it is STILL BLUE. Be extremely careful because this stuff dyes your hair blue.. Yikes!!
3,Not what I thought,Bought for my 73 yr old mom and she was hoping was 2 in 1 however it wasn't. I won't buy again
2,Inadequate Information,"This product does not have adequate product directions. I used the product and it turned my hair purple. When I called Clairol, I was told that you should only use it every two weeks. The product does not indicate that on the bottle. The representative indicatd that it is only intended for professional use.I was very disappointed in the attitude of the representative."
3,Good for Highlights/Not for Yellow!,"This product does brighten the white in my hair, but the yellow stubbornly remains resistant. Still searching for the product that WORKS!"
5,"Just what ive been searching for, for years!!!!","I just came across this product a few days ago and began reading reviews, it seemed like the magic solution I been searching for years for my bleach blonde style. I dont want anyone else to find it so they dont look as good as I do HAHHAHAHAHA. LOVE IT!!! And all Blondes will love this purple stuff. PS. it hardly smells at all."
3,"This shampoo is ok, not great!","I bought this shampoo since I could not find any Pantene Silver shampoo after they stopped making it. I know Clairol is a good brand, so I ordered it. It leaves my hair somewhat greasy and it is impossible for me to go the next day without shampooing. My hair is extremely greasy then! I am disappointed!"
1,Foul smelling product,"I have mid brown hair with ashy blonde highlights that tend towards brassy and I purchased this after reading all the reviews here on Amazon. I have to say that after using it my hair was dry and smelt so bad that I couldn't wait to wash my hair again to rid myself of the odor. Yes, it worked a little but the smell was so unpleasant for me that I will not use this again. I was avoiding people all day so that they wouldn't smell me! I would consider using this again only if they improved the smell - yes it was that bad! I will continue looking for a better product.Clairol Shimmer Lights - Blonde & Silver Shampoo - 16 Fl. Oz., 16 Fl Oz"
3,Overly Stiff,"These bungees seem well made and they work, but they're so stiff that I haven't really used them. Honestly when I need something held that tight I just tie it with a rope. A bungee to me is half spring and should be easy to stretch and attach.I got them for camera work (Strobist), but I'm afraid to use them on any of my gear other than a tripod because I'm afraid it will crack the plastic."
4,good classic wok,"Carbon steel for good heat transfer, no nonstick coating so it can be used at stir-frying (high) temperature without concern about chemical contamination. Out of the box I gave it a good cleaning and seasoning with peanut oil. After use all it needs is light cleaning and wiping with a little oil before putting away. The flat bottom keeps it steady on any cooktop, the medium gauge and uniform thickness mean it heats quickly and evenly. For best results in high temp cooking like most stir-frying or flash-frying, use peanut oil to avoid smoking the oil. 4 star not 5 because the longer handle has a slight wobble; the cutout where it fits over the metal tab on the pan is slightly too wide, not a hazard, but an occasional annoyance."
3,Good buy,This is a wok and it does everything expected from it. My wife loves it and its been a hit with her. Of course the only drawback i find is that cleaning this thing takes quite an effort. The stains dont leave so easily and also there is this residue-ish like stain which sticks around even after cleaning the hell out of it. But it dosent cause hte food to taste any different or funky. Very sturdy item. I would recommend it.
1,Terrible Wok,"I wish I could give it a minus five star rating.It's apparently a mistake to buy this piece of junk because I think I should give it a try since its rating is not bad. I followed the simple instruction, and tried to be very careful for each step. Still, I got blackend pan bottom with burned smell all over the house.I'd recommend you buy a non-stick one for peace of mind. I can't imagine you have to spend 4*15 minutes=1 hour for the seasoning and so easily have a mess. Even after that, after each use, you still have to apply cooking oil to avoid rust. If I still bother to spend so much time and care for a wok, why wouldn't I just get a $10 wok. This Shi* doesn't differ itself from a $10 one you can easily find in any Chinese super market.Don't waste your money. The junk is not worth it."
4,Partial history lesson,Very interesting as far as the plot and the history - enjoyed reading this book. I would commend this book to everyone.
3,bookgram,I liked this story and thought it contained correct historical and societal detail. We tend over time to forget the differences in Hawaiian cultures and of that time period. It was also a quick read and enjoyable. The author-detective was more of a real person caught up in the Pearl Harbor disaster while figuring out the mystery. I think Max Collins afterword is very good in establishing his sources and presenting E R Burroughs as a real person. You can't fault Collin's research on his topics.
5,Good read,I visited Hawaii this year and throughly enjoyed reading about the area with a mystery murder that kept me reading.I would recomend this book as a good read.
3,Fanciful spin on history,"Like the other murder mysteries in the historical series, this one tells a nifty little Who-Dunit...but somehow the fact that it occurs amid the tragedy of Pearl Harbor makes it all distasteful. Perhaps in another 20 years enough time will have passed to separate the reader from the humanity of the actual events. Then again, I hope not."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!,"This cable may show as being beige in the product photo, but as my title implies IT IS NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!! I wanted a beige cable, to match my classic beige PC monitor, but I received a BLACK cable instead!! UGH!!! When will Amazon ever realize that they're not always selling what they're actually advertising??!!I gave this item only two stars, because of what I wrote above, and that I can still use it. I'll just keep it as a backup cable for the one I have already in use on the same screen. The cable might also come in handy if I ever decide to add another monitor to my terminal, since I am also running dual PCI Express 2.0 video cards, both of which are equipped with one or more DVI terminals. Well, one is dual-DVI and the other is DVI with HDMI."
1,Won't turn on.,I am out of ideas.I can't find the manual online.When i insert it nothing happens.And my gameboy works with batteries just fine.
1,Shrinks are responsible for sexual revolution,"Even this is an older book, but whatever Rogers suggest are horrible. No wonder families are broken, marriage dissolved.Shrinks are responsible!!!"
3,Poor selection of letters,"Although I love books of letters, I found this anthology uninspiring and a poorly chosen group of contributors. The letters rely mostly upon the interest of the reader in the author, not the content of the letter itself. For example: Arlo Guthrie is a neat character, but in his letter to his son, when he tells him to be thankful to God -- why? Sure, It's good advice, and any half-wit can relay it, but the real intellect and insight comes in explaining why someone ought to be thankful to God when they or someone else is suffering. I think a much, much better anthology of letters can be found in Lisa Grunwald and Stephen Adler's ""Letters of the Century"". It collects hundreds of letters from authors famous and anonymous, and each is tremendously insightful about the emotions of the author, and often makes prescient remarks about the era."
4,Great for practicing at home,"Granted I went from a 10 year old squire amp to this behringer amp, but the sound quality is much better. This is a very basic practice amp, but I like the sound options that is has. I would recommend this for people practicing at their home, but definitely not if you plan to play out anywhere."
3,OK,This amp is small and not very powerful. Works ok just w/o a mic because there is no built in preamp. Good for guitar if you don't need to be too loud
5,A father comes to grips with his own beliefs,"This series is very good. You really need to read the first book which I believe is ""The Covenant"" and then proceed to the rest. All five are very good. You begin to ""feel at home"" when you read about these people and grow to love them. I am at the end of the last book and hate to finish it! The story line starts with the two oldest of Abram's daughters and weaves much of their lives throughout all of the books but this book in particualr focus's a lot on the things that having been brewing in Abram's life and brings some of his issues to a head. I have enjoyed all of them immensely but I as I already stated I do believe you have to read them from the beginning to benefit from the real story. Keep with them, becasue at some point you may be disappointed at how the story is going but you will see a wonderful story unfold if you continue on."
4,Linda,Love the fourth book. Can not wait to finish up the series with the fifth book. I will tell my friends to read this series.
5,WARNING...she is going to suck you in again.,"I cannot put this series down. These books would make great Hallmark movies just like Love Comes Softly! Now, on to the final book of the series."
5,Another can't put it down book,"I preordered this book, reading two thirds the first night I received it. This series is the best of Beverly Lewis's adult books. Via her website I contacted her and there is one more book to be available next summer (2005). The Ebersol family have become friends of mine. Another reviewer is correct, there are secrets revealed but just as many left uncovered. The characterizations are so rich and deep. Beverly Lewis is quite knowledgeable of the Amish and you will learn a lot about them as you read this book. The downside to reading this book in two nights is that I have to wait a year to learn more about the Ebersols and their community."
5,Well worth your time and money,"I have now read all four books in the Abram's Daughters series and can't wait for the next one in the summer of 2005. I really didn't expect to enjoy these books because they're so different from what I usually read. I'm a fan of true crime and thrillers almost exclusively and, of course, Lewis' books couldn't be more different. But I found that when I finished one, I couldn't wait to start the next one and the next one until I had finished all of them. Besides the enjoyment of reading them, I learned a lot about the Amish culture which has always fascinated me. They are wonderful stories and I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Beverly Lewis did it again,I never read books like this I have read every book that beverly lewis wrote and this is another Great read. I start them and I can't put them down. I would recomnend this and all of her others .
1,The Prodigal from Carrie213,I never received this book from Carrie213 and I re-ordered it from your_online_book_store. That one has already been sent but I haven't received it yet.
4,Prodigal,This was a good book but did not hold my interest as the first three books in the series did.
3,Was not a hardback as described,"Received book quickly, was a more worn than described. Book also has a softcover not hardback as described. Giving it as a present and like to give hardbacks"
1,Unacceptable Typographical Errors,"Even though this is the TENTH EDITION of this book, it has several inexcuseable typographical errors! For example, on page 85, the equation for the mean has the wrong denominator. On page 88, the equation for the variance has a missing denominator. This is sloppiness of the highest order. I would never recommend this book to anyone and I would be embarassed if I were either of the authors."
2,Didn't like it!,"I did not like this book. It is called ""Elementary"" statistics but does not provide elementary(SIMPLE) examples or steps to problems for those students who have never had statistics before. I personally think its a hard read. The definitions provided are fine but the math steps could be simpler. The student suite that came with it did not work in my computer( don't know why). I just wish I would have had a chance to see it Before purchasing. I still love Amazon though!Thanks."
3,An OK book for a kid to start with,"This book rates just ok with me because I have seen and read better books to get a kid started in chess.This book needs some serious updating in graphics (it reads and looks like it was written long ago and the explanations could be made more clear). When I was smaller I learned how the pieces moved with ""YOU CAN PLAY CHESS"" which had fun pictures for me. When I got older I found that ""CHESS FOR JUNIORS"" was great and had a lot of detail in not just rules but the strategy you need to get started and then some!I hope they update and upgrade this book. It would be a really good book then."
2,OK at best and certainly not the best beginners book,"I have this and ""Chess For Juniors"" (Random House). This book is just ok. It doesn't build on the lessons and does not come accross nearly as clearly as ""Chess For Juniors""."
4,Rydberg and non-competitiveness,"My only complaint is that the activities mention do not really fit in with specific scripture passages. This is hard for me since I like to start with the scripture and work backward to activities. The activities themselves are great, though."
5,One of the Most Important Books of Our Time,"The Fixer is one of the most important books of our time and is a literary masterpiece. It should be required reading for all high school and college students. This story shows how one ordinary man can reach into the depths of his soul to find the courage, dignity, strength and humanity to remain steadfast in his embrace of truth and internal freedom. The hero of the story rises above his captors, persecutors, self-appointed judges and corrupt, superstitious and prejudiced society itself in his struggle for justice. The reader comes away from the story with a strenthened faith in the ability of one man to make a difference, to stand up and be heard and to uphold the truth. Melamud teaches us that justice cannot be denied when even one man refuses to give up his pursuit and refuses to fall into despair. I recommend it to all readers."
2,Slow,"What is fascinating is that this story is actualy based on that of Mendel Beilis, a Jewish fixer, arrested in 1911 for the alleged murder of a 12 year old. The story, though moving in its portrayal of suffering and helplessness amid what is obviously a false charge, is still excessively slow. None the less, it reveals the superstitiousness, gullibility and anti-semitic feeling prevalent in Kiev, and indeed all Russia, at the time."
4,Another dark chapter in Russia's history,"Bernard Malamud's The Fixer is a brutal examination of one man's attempt to deny his faith and then suffer purely because of it. While there are elements of Kafka in this book (The Trial); Malamud focuses on the historical reality of a Jew being blamed for a ""ritualistic"" murder despite all evidence to the contrary. Occasionally, the description of the tedium of Yakov's stay in jail, mixed with the horror of it, can wear on the reader; but it is by demonstrating this that Malamud succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the times. The combination of history lesson and one man's struggle to hold onto what is really important makes this book an important one."
1,Condition of used book purchased The Fixer by Bernard Malamud,"The Fixer--The book I ordered was listed as used in good condition. The pages were yellowed and had a strong musty smell. They were unmarked and not torn, but the book was not very appealing to hold. Fortunately, the novel is excellent so I forged ahead even though the physical characteristics of the book were not very appealing."
5,One of the best books of all time!,"Do not hesitate, read this one. This is a true classic, read it pass it on, and enjoy! Malamud at his best!"
4,the book is about injustice&religious persecution in russia.,"I found this book extremely well written but painful to read. the premise appears that it can always get ""worse"" no matter how bad it is. there is flagrant anti-semitism in every aspect of Russian society, yet the protagonist is condemned to survive, or destined to survive no matter what."
3,"i did not read this book, yet the title seems cool!","yet I did not open the book cover, the cover is painted with many pretty colors and flickering lights. I cannot wait to understand the meaning of the word ""the."" I hope you guys out there go get this book, just for the sheer cover."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!,"Who told Malamud that he could write? Based on a factual murder or not, this book is definitely full of pointless details that don't move the story (if it can even be called that) along, but only impede it. The writing and phrasing are flat and lifeless. Nothing can be felt for the characters because there isn't any kind of ""life"" vibe from them. That said, the book should be re-titled ""Yakov Calls His Wife Horrible Names And Disrespects God"". I had to read this pathetic trash of a novel for my English class, and nothing irritates me more. I can barely stay awake when my teacher talks about it. If you want real authors that actually have talent, check out books by Grimson, Bloch, or Blatty. Don't waste your time with The Fixer. The book was a waste of paper and ink."
2,Harsh.,"I continued reading because it was a book club selection. Otherwise, I would not have finished it. It was so depressing! Not a fun read, but informative."
1,Horrible will not recommend it for anyone.!!,"I bought this phone for my dad who is a 57 year old man and as you can imagine he doesn't like smartphones. He has been in love with this phone since it first came out to the market. This version says to be the international version saw I bought because he lives in Honduras. H e says the first 2 weeks worked just fine but after that the phone would turn off, people would call him and the phone wouldnt ring not even a notification and on top of all of that the signal was not good."
3,It works but I need a smart phone,"Product was as described, delivered promptly, and in good condition. It didn't take me very long to realize that although I thought I wanted a non-smart phone, I changed my mind after struggling with text messages for 3 days. Still going to keep the phone for use when traveling abroad (since it's unlocked), but opted to go ahead and get a smart phone. They are simply so much easier to use, virtually the same size, and have infinitely more capabilities."
1,Steve E,Disappointed. Phone randomly shut itself off. Great features when it worked. Returned RAZR V3XX and exchanged for another Motorola phone.30 Days and I still don't have a phone. Poor turn around time.
4,TOP TEN is almost top,"Bought these shoes just because I liked their look...I love old-school basketball shoes, and these in my opinion are among the best ever! I didn't wear them, just tried them for a few minutes, so I can't be very helpful to those who want to know how these shoes act with normal using. My first impression is that it's a very comfortable shoe. The walk is very good because the foot is not loose inside it.Leather is not really top quality, is a bit thin and wrinkly...it's very soft, and this is good for comfort, but I have some doubts about how long they can last...I have other Adidas shoes with much better leather (like Pro Model Vintage, Nastase and my favourite: Adidas Rom!!!).Anyway it's a very good shoe, with a great style and character, like almost all old-school sneakers have...and this is one of the best!!!"
1,Over-Priced Pricing Book,"The irony about this book is that, this is a very Over-priced Book, that just got priced out by other reasonably priced Books."
4,Great movie and very entertaining,Son loved getting this movie for his birthday. He has watched it several times and really enjoys it each time.
2,Not sure what the appeal is,"This is a heavy handed techno track that borrows heavily on the synth riff from Duran Duran's Save a Prayer. Now I really love that synth riff, but the way they use it makes it immensely redundant. Most of these tracks are just repetitive beats and grooves with no variation or dynamic pacing. They even stick with the same chord progression. Every track has a pounding bead, but a droning feel to it except for The Viper Remix. That one actually put some interesting variation to the song and is the only track I can recommend.Looks like this is a rare CD and fetches a premium price. Why is beyond me. You're better off just looking for the Viper Remix on some download service and be done with the mediocre mixes."
3,Pretty good Christmas CD,"Some of the selections on this CD are just lovely - I Saw Three Ships by James Galway, Sleigh Ride, etc., but a few are too ""heavy"" for my taste. I may be getting fussy about Christmas music in my old age, but I practically run out of stores that feature ""dead guys singing"" Christmas pop or depressing, somber ""Christmas music to slash your wrists to."" Give me upbeat Christmas music any day."
3,big ommission...,"...this album is missing the movies biggest hit, which makes it dissapointingly incomplete-apple pie without the ice-cream-how insensitive...:)"
4,Just a little disappointed,"I LOVED the movie Bed of Roses and had to have the soundtrack. I'm just a little disappointed. Although I love the song Independent Love Song, how come The Right Place by Eddi Reader is not on the soundtrack? It is one of the best songs in the movie - when he takes her with him delivering flowers for the first time. I love those scenes. I was hoping that song was on the CD and it's not, but I still enjoy the CD. Every time I play it I can picture the whole movie, it's great."
5,Absolutley Enchanting,"I have not heard the CD yet, but am dieing to own it! Every time I watch the movie, it reminds me of the song ""What the World Needs Now Is Love"" from the soundtrack ""My Best Friend's Wedding. I always feel that all that girl needed was love! I also love the funny lines in it like, her best friend's answering message. ""HI. You can leave a message if you want to. But if you don't, I'll understand. Everybody should see the movie and buy the CD!"
1,worse than cardboard,"looks and smells great, but has no taste... not a repeat purchase. calorie count is same as sugar free pilsbury"
4,Not the same as the original,"This movie was really good and Jack Palance plays his usual snotty self. But if you a looking for the movie to be the same as the original, you are mistaken. Still worth watching, but with a different story line."
1,Not a good movie,"Why do you need to invert the characters make good characters bad and the vilest (but very bright) John Silver good?The book is about a few good people, because of their discipline, faith and sense of duty, prevailing over many criminals.The movie is about moral equivalence. It can be compared to a movie about 9/11 making bin-Ladin a good guy and president Bush a bad one."
1,"Too Little, Too High","Won't repeat what all of you have said, but could not agree more. I will not be buying this one unless I get it used. I bought Vol. I of Rawhide and felt cheated for how little I got for my money so I will not be buying the 2nd half of that either. Give us the whole season or just stop producing the DVDs."
1,destroying a fantastic western!!!,"i think it's a damn shame that these studios think that the money we have grows on trees!! you put out the COMPLETE 1st SEASON, and then you take the rest of the series and divide them up. well i for one, WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE! MOST OF THE ONES BUYING THEM ARE ON A LIMITED INCOME. I STOPPED BUYING TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL, FOR THE SAME REASON. THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO ALL THE LOYAL FANS!!! LARRY W."
1,Brilliant!!!!,"I can see it now. A meeting in Paramount's boardroom. One stuffed shirt says ""I have an idea. Let's sell the first complete season of Gunsmoke for a fair price. Then, when we have them hooked we'll release a half season for the same price. They'll never notice the difference."" Then some lower echelon brown noser hollers ""Brilliant!!!!!"" Not so brilliant. We noticed! What shabby treatment for your customers. I enjoyed the first season and was looking forward to the second season. Will not purchase the second season now. Shame on you. When they don't sell maybe you can sell them for frisbees. Will stick with Wanted Dead Or Alive, Have Gun Will Travel, Cheyenne, and Guns of Will Sonnett. Again, shame on you."
5,Got to have it.,If you have Vol. 2 - you got to have Vol. 1. You just can't have one without the other.
3,"Gunsmoke The Second Season, Vol. 1","I love the Gunsmoke Series because I am 72 years old and I watched Gunsmoke for the 20 years that it was on TV. The reason I am buying the series now is because I have a 10 year old grandson and I want him to know how my childhood was when I was young. He showe an interest in the show So I am hopefully going to purchase the enire 20 years of the series for him and I to watch together. I tried unsucessfully to find Gunsmoke Season 1 Vol 2 so I am unsure how to go about finding it and I really wish I coul find the entire series to purchase everything. I have great memories of my TV shows when I was young. I alsi watched Bonanza, Rawhide, Wellsfargo,the virginian, Big Valley, and all the others. I have ourchased approximately 150 Weasterns from your Company already. I love the John Wayne, Clint Easstwood movies as I have most of thm too.Glenn Boyd5018 Woodlane Drive Woodbury, Minn. 55129-5005 Cell Phone 651-387-8476eagleonte @msn.com"
2,Viacom/Columbia House Blow It Again!,"Ditto all the previous reviews that take issue with the manner in which the GUNSMOKE DVDs are being released. Someone in charge needs to get a clue. Release seasons in complete format, not split, and let's keep in mind that those early seasons have many more episodes than series today, but they are half hour episodes. Release the sets on a faster timeline. No one will keep buying them for 11 years. Those who are interested are interested NOW. As another said, they are pushing me hard toward those who are providing the entire series. One further rant - no way can I believe they do not have the original, uncut versions, the versions originally aired. Why do we have to settle for 'possibly cut' versions? Major business decision errors going on up the line."
1,More Corporate rip-offs,"Bought the first season and loved it. I have been looking **so** forward to the next release but I will not play Paramount's rip-off game!Instead, I will do the same thing I did with all the Star Trek series...buy them all used. That is the best way I can think of to stick-it right back to Paramount just as they are trying to stick-it to us."
1,smoke from gunsmoke,"I could have accepted half a season for half a price, but at this cost. Forget it..I think it`s time to get out of Dodge...."
1,GREEDY BLOOD SUCKING STUDIO MORONS !,"Again greed shakes it UGLY HEAD in the form of the Blood Sucking money grabbing studio morons. This is one of the greatest television shows of all time that ran for 20 years. So in their infinite wisdom the studio is now releasing one half of the season at a time. Maybe within the next 20 years the series will be complete. I own season one and thought finally we can get this one full season at a time.....BUT NO !!!! It is time to send a message to these LEECHES and boycott this purchase. I am also boycotting the future release of any series that will be offered in this format...It is time to kick them where it hurts...In their big, over stuffed wallets!"
3,Shameful!!!,"I am pretty mixed as to my rating for this series. I give 3 stars because the series was and is one of the all time best. BUT, the way this series is coming out on DVD is less than 1 star. It is preposterous that to think that I may be dead before the complete series is ever produced. If the company is just looking to make the big bucks producing the series this way, they may just actually lose in the long run. Who wants to buy portions of the series at the company's whim? Not me! I will actually go to another source where I will be able to get the whole series in combine! I am totally upset with this studio idea of portioning and it should be against everyones grain to even think about purchasing this series in this manner."
5,Gunsmoke The Second Season Vol. 1,"I know how upset everyone seems to be because only volume 1 of season 2 was released. I'm upset as well but I just could not pass up this wonderful show. The print is wonderful, the sound excellent, and I hope we can get at least the second part of season 2 before the studio stops releasing the other volumes due to non support. I recommend this set to any fan of this wonderful show."
5,MATT DILLION US MARSHALL,"RETURN TO THE OLD DAYES OF GREAT CLASSIC WESTERNS ,IF YOU LOVED THE OLD RADIO SHOW OR THE TV SERIES ,SOME ON TV LAND RERUNS, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN FOR YERS EXCEPT FOR A SHORT TIME IN 02 IT WAS PARTIALY RUNBUT NOT IN THE CLEAR ORDERING WAY THE BOXED SET HAS ! I OWN BOTH AND LOVE IT ,THIS MORE OF A CLEAN BUT DARKER WESTERN SERIES BUT STILL FIT FOR FAMILY VIEWING, THE WRITERS ARE STILL ON STRIKE SO THIS CAN NOT ONLY FILL THE GAP IN BUT HIGHTEN YOUR LOVE FOR OLD TV WESTERNS!"
1,5 Stars for Gunsmoke 0 Stars for Greedy Paramont,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of the second season, but like most fans was disappointed at the level of greed at Paramont. They did the same with Rawhide season 2. Though I desperately want season 2 (and all future seasons) of both Gunsmoke and Rawhide, I will never buy them until Paramont stops being so greedy. I hope when they see sales plummet, the person responsible will be fired and fans will be able to get full seasons at a reasonable price."
5,Fond Memories,"I was about 10-12years of age when I first began to watch Gunsmoke on TVand have been watching episodes every since. Born 1946, I'm 62 now andproud to have a collection of my childhood western hero showing betternow on CD's than that old B/W set in the 1950's. I intend to get allvolumes until the collection is completed."
3,"Great Content, A Marketing Decision Only Paramount Could Make","There is another reason to complain: the original CBS VHS tapes (which, to make a comparison, were sold at $25 for 4 episodes)had the original airdate at the start of the episode, which added to the value I found in this great series (where was I? what were my family and I doing? that kind of thing)But the first release of the DVDs did not have that and should.When I watch these amazing, groundbreaking series, I want to know not only when I was seeing it but when America was seeing it for the first time.You would have thought Paramount would have learned their lessons from Star Trek."
1,They have to be nuts!,"I bought the first season, but there is no way I'm going to buy half seasons of a 20 year show. I'll rent the DVD when I want to watch it."
5,Review of Gunsmoke Season 2 - Volume 1 DVD,"I am a great fan of Gunsmoke and when I saw that most of the reviews for season 2, volume 1 were negative, I was quite surprized. However, after reading them I realized that their complaint was not with the DVD, but with CBS/Paramount for splitting up the seasons into 2 parts - for what appears to be either greed, or an opportinuty to end production of a series that they do not expect to make money on (i.e. ""The series just didn't sell or there was not enough interest"". In reality, season 2, volume 1 has the same high quality and standards as all Gunsmoke seasons and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates great western classics! I do hope however; that consumers will complain to CBS/Paramount to put these seasons into one DVD each. After all, this IS a 20 season series!"
1,Overpriced,"Buying half a season at a full season price is not sensible. I would rather throw away my antenna and splurge on Cable or Satellite like all the other morons out there who should just disconnect. If everybody stopped paying, the advertisers would see to it that we all got free cable or satellite but there is a sucker born every minute. Not me, I bought the first fantastic season of Gunsmoke and I can re-watch it along with my other 800 sensibly priced DVDs instead of wasting gas money on a DVD where Ms Kittty goes from 25 to 36 in a single year."
1,Half Season!!! Matt Dillon doesn' deserve this!,"Absurd! Outrageous! Now this stupid way of releasing TV series in two halves for each season has reached Gunsmoke! Fox and Paramount are becoming very greedy and insulting the people who buy this sort of DVDs. It is really disappointing to acquire half season of these classic TV series (Gunsmoke, The Big Valley, Rawhide, The Streets of San francisco, The Untouchables and others) and wait months and months, or a whole year, to get the other half. I will never buy half seasons any longer...this is a clear message to Paramount and Fox."
1,disappointed,"I'm going to make this brief. I never thought I would write something like this but I have decided not to order Gunsmoke, season 2, vol. 1 because of the multi-volume per season nonsense. If they want to charge, go ahead, most of us will pay but we want to see the entire collection before we are dead!!! I'm sure the folks making Gunsmoke available want to get their end now also, don't they? Come on, wake up folks!"
1,I agree with movieman,"I agree with Movieman. This is absurd. Personally, I buy these shows for nostalgic reasons. I grew up on Gunsmoke & and want the entire series and want it now. At this rate, I'll be dead before the entire series is released, if indeed it ever is ! A look at the past may be a look into the future. This has been released before in the same ""volume"" manner and was abandoned less than half way through the series. It will likely be abandoned again.The entire bootlegged series can be bought for $250. I do not condone bootlegging nor have I purchased bootlegged copies of anything in the past but it appears, if I want the entire Gunsmoke series while I am still alive to enjoy it and at an affordable price, I am left with no other choice.I will not buy season 2 volume 1. I will wait and see what happens, then I will make my decision whether to purchase or buy bootlegged."
1,All 20 seasons in 67 Volumes At $30 Each Is $2010.,"At 2 volumes per each of the half-hour seasons 2-6, and 4 volumes per each of the hour-long seasons 7-20, plus the already released first season, that's a fortune, and how many decades until the whole series of 635 episodes is released?"
1,One & Done For Me,"Let's see if I have this straight. I buy all of the first season episodes, a total of 1,051 minutes of viewing time for $29.49. Then I have the opportunity to purchase half of the second season, a total of 526 minutes viewing time for $30.99 - $1.50 more than the full season one? I don't theenk so, Lucy!When Amazon first listed this Season 2, Volume 1 set a few weeks ago, the price was $25.49. Now it's gone up $5.50 to $30.99 and it is still only half a season. I guess Paramount has ""heard our pleas"" and raised the price to make up for all of us who have said we're not buying this one.As for Gunsmoke - it's ""One and Done"" for me unless they make some changes."
2,Waiting for the sale.,"I just picked up Gunsmoke - Season Three, Volumes 1 & 2 on sale at Best Buy for the amazing price of $12.99 each!!! I'll be sitting back and waiting for a sale deal on Season Two as well. I can understand splitting seasons for the one hour classics, such as ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Untouchables"", which had per episode running times of 47-50 minutes each, but splitting seasons for a half hour show is unconscionable. As much as I love this show, I'll pass on it unless I can find it at a deep discount, or used at Newbury Comics (A GREAT New England DVD retailer."
3,"less intensity, more melancholy","If you thought Dose was too intense, then maybe you'll like this one better. But for me, Dose would be hard to top, and LBI doesn't come close. It's a fine album, but not in the same ballpark. LBI has a slicker sound than its predecessors, and there is less soloing, but the main difference seems to be summed up in the lyrics to the title track -- ""Yesterday's anger is the sadness of today."" The highlights are the cuts that break this dominant mournful mood. The opening riff of ""Wandering Child"" gets things off to a good start, ""Bad Little Doggie"" is an upbeat toe-tapper, and ""I Think You Know What I Mean"" has a wry sense of humor, getting in digs at politicians including Reagan. ""In My Life"" is the best song on the album, a beautiful acoustic number. The hidden track, ""If I Had Possession of Judgement Day,"" is an all-out blues shuffle with slide guitar and electric piano. And kudos for the clever conceptual artwork!"
3,Gov't Mule,"The third studio album from Gov't Mule, does not dissappoint. This time out the band have enlisted several artists to help round out their sound, including Ben Harper who appears on ""Lay Your Burden Down."" The album features alot of what you would expect, but also contains a few suprises. For instance, there are alot of guitar overdubs, so that the guitar does not 'drop out' during the solos. This is rare for the mule, because they usually prefer to record more or less 'live.' Overall, it's not quite as strong as their last effort ""Dose"" but it's still a great album. If your already a Gov't Mule fan, or if you like blues-based southern rock, then I definately recommend this album."
3,sold out,The CD sounds like Gov't Mule has been bought by the industry. Just look inside the CD. The little man driving the head. What is that all about? Thanks Mule for the Hidden track that's what the Mule is all about.
2,Disappointing,"I cannot begin to express my disappointment with this album. Warren Hayne's talent belies the product of this work. You can tell this is a search for something lost, but never found. ""Bad Little Doggie"" is about as close as they get to anything that even resembles the talent of an indiviual that can compare with the legendary Duane Allman. Out of respect for Warren Hayne's talent, and ONLY out of respect for Warren Hayne's talent will I give this album one or two more chances...sometimes, as we all know, music can grow on you, but honestly...this album is awful. I'd love to get my money back."
5,Outstanding,"This is an album that seems to get better with every listen. I think it is better than Dose, but still can't compare with their live albums. Every song here is excellent, although the overall sound is somewhat darker than previous material. Warren Haynes is a great singer/guitarist, and the guests Ben Harper and Hook Herrera really add to the album."
4,Another Good Album,"This is a good band. I own all of their CD's. On this one, Johnny Neel's keyboards adds just the right touch and feel to a number of songs. My favorite song by far: No Need to Suffer. Great guitar, tremendous bass line, good vocal. Kind of wierd lyrics, though. Just what is this song about?"
5,LOVE!! my innotek,"We bought this training system almost 3 years ago. We had a VERY unruly lab/bloodhound mix that always ran off. After just a month of using the collar she hardly ever ran off again. After a few months of using it we'd put it on her but never even ""turn it on"" and she was a great dog. Eventually we didn't have to use it anymore. We never had any problems with it at all. You just have to remember to charge it up. The only thing is that the collar was long on her and we never cut it down to size so she chewed off the excess, HAHA. But other than that it was a GREAT investment!"
5,AWESOME!!,"I heard ""Masquerade"" on Sunny 99.1 at 11:45 Saturday night and it was AWESOME! I happened to be listening in on the way home and it was awesome!! I just wanted you to know. I bought the CD as soon as I got home. It is so good to hear great contemporary jazz!!"
2,Blander isn't better,"I certainly agree with majority of reviewers that this is an impeccably played & delivered product. The problem?-it's quite, quite boring. While not without its charms (Coco la Mer moves pretty well & Clouds is a tuneful number), smoothness runs into blandness pretty quickly & this definitely lacks the spirit & groove of ""Identity"".Siva has a bucketload of talent & hopefully will stretch out more on upcoming product(s)"
1,Forget Singer and Get Jean Scott!,"This book is a ridiculous exercise in disputing the indisputable. Video poker is a game based on math and not luck. In the long run you will win or lose based on the strategy you use and the type of machine you play. That is a fact.Singer really is an amateur in this area. I recommend you read Jean Scott's ""Frugal Gambler"" and leave Singer's book in the warehouse collecting dust where it deserves.I play video poker at least three times a week and I can tell you that if I applied Singer's ideas I'd be broke now."
1,Absolute crap,"He essentially espouses a progression system and has constantly and consistently slammed knowledgeable and respected gambling professionals in many realms. If you want to get better at video poker, this book isn't the book for you. But if you want to feel better about yourself playing video poker, all the while losing your shirt, by all means, this is the book for you."
1,A Waste of Money,"Jean Scott is right about this book, it is a waste of time and money. The only way to win at video poker is to play the mathematically correct way on the right machines. Singer is selling snake oil."
4,Undeniable Truth Is Undeniably Right On,"I purchased this book seeking a definition of how and why I play. That is exactly what I got. I was glad to finally see that others if only one Mr. Singer have the boldness to step forward and tell everyone he has lost, why he has lost, and most importantly to me why I have lost and still do. It was good to see another say he was addicted to the game. I think all players are addicted in one way or another. All the books I've read in the past from Mr. Singer's guru friends were nothing but attempts to get me and all the others to buy more of their wares. I don't say I'm perfect, but I don't believe anyone else can defeat the video poker computers either, and that is the message Mr. Singer continually dictates. How very true. If only someone else had the guts to come out with the truth years ago, I and probably many many others would not have lost as much to the casinos as we have. This author should receive an award."
3,Book Lacks Broad Perspective Needed to Appeal to Non-Jews,"At the risk of being labeled anti-semitic, this American WWII veteran and member of the Boston Latin School Class of 1946 must observe that the Holocaust was much more than a Jewish event: It was genocide in its fullest form involving persons and groups adjudged by Nazis as undesirable -- gypsies, undesirable Aryans, almost anyone who offended almost any German citizen. Dwelling on the destruction of Jews in Europe, who comprised the bulk of the murdered citizenry tells a large part of the story of the Holocaust, but it borders on the offensive to suggest that Jewish suffering is the whole story. I would find the Holocaust Museum, just four blocks from my home a much more acceptable place if it had been named The Genocide Mueum."
5,WOLFGARTEN,Wolfgarten makes good attachments but awful long handles. The short handles are ok. The long ones will fatigue and break at the button hole. Then you have to make a handle to use the attachment.That being said I use this rake in my garden a lot. It's just the right width. Not so wide as to bea pain to use but wide enough to be efficient.Your mileage may vary. Heads up on the long handles.
5,Love it!,"Again, love the versatility and sturdiness of the WOLF-Garten utensils. This rake is TOUGH. Have been cleaning up a garbage pile of broken glass, cans, etc. and the tines are perfect for getting the chunks while leaving behind the sand."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"Look twice, this purchase is for the rake head only. I bought this as a gift for my father, I couldn't believethe pole didn't come with it. I had to turn right and spend more money for the pole than the rake cost. Very embarrassing. Contract law requires a meeting of the minds. This is a very misleading, unprofessional ad. It should be removed."
3,"Quality product, but...",This Wolf product is high-end and seems like it will last for years. But...you need to buy the handle in addition to buying the rake portion -- which can be costly.
2,Misleading Picture,"As a huge fan of this movie, I ordered this DVD assuming that it was a 2 disc deluxe edition, as the featured pictures would lead one to believe. However the copy that I received from MovieMars was a basic 1 disc copy in a regular case. Seeing as I already own that particular version, I basically wasted 20 bucks. I'm not sure if any of the other sellers have the 2 disc version, but I was very disappointed with what I received from MovieMars. As for the movie itself, its freaking fantastic in any packaging and I highly recommend it!"
3,PUNK?,"I have just finished watching this film for the 1st time. I was a little concerned when i saw the 2 long haired ""punks"" in the fictional band on the cover. After watching the film i am disappointed. Joe Dick and Billy Talent pull off the punk attitude convincingly enough, but the other two members of the band are a schizophrenic hippie and an 80's era hair metal drummer. At one point in the film the band members all drop LSD, and in some satanic/hippie orgy slaughter a goat with a chainsaw, and drink its blood. Pointless... I bought this film expecting an accurate portrayal of punk rock history. Other than very brief appearances by Joey Ramone (R.I.P.) and D.O.A., there was nothing punk rock about this film... If you aren't a punk purest, and want to see a decent rock and roll road trip film, this is for you. If you want to see a film about punk rock, don't waste your time on this."
2,A special two stars here,"An evil movie about evil peoplewho make a mockery of music...by it appears another set of evil peoplewith the motivation of putting down the other guys?!""Who do they think they are?""to paraphrase one of the ""hit"" songsof this imaginary punk rock group.If there is either wisdom or entertainmentin nasty guys putting down nasty guys,it escapes me. This movie is really not much...in dialog, acting, music production orinspiration. Dirty business made plainas dirt?"
4,A very good book,"I really appreciate Steve Jenkins' books, which combine very creative paper illustrations with compelling facts about animals. They're creative, fun, and educational. The only reason I give this book a 4 instead of 5 is that while very good, it doesn't have the same ""wow"" factor as several other books he's done."
4,Nature in a book,"My kid of 3 loves this book. Yes it is a short read, but it teaches body parts, animal names, and facts. We have a great time compairing our hands and feet to those in the book. Read to grow."
1,This is a Kohl's book!,"This book can be bought at Kohl's department store for $5.00. The seller fails to mention this fact. I srnt mine back. If I want a Kohl's book, I'll buy it at Kohl's and let the proceeds go to The Children's foundation."
3,Not for kids past the second grade,This book is lovely for kindergarten and first grade kids but past that grade it would be boring. Most kids past the age of 6 or 7 have made several tripe to the zoo so you'd be wasting your money on this book for the older child.
4,And so it goes,This book provides an extensive overview of the treatment options for prostate cancer. It cleared up a number of misunderstandings which I had.
3,Not a bad Techno Trax release (as of late).,Particularly good was Junk Project's Disciple (2nd track). The other compiled tracks included after that make it worth the $20. If you are going to get one of the newer Techno Trax albums this is the one (not 19 or <so I hear> 21).
3,"Extensive and wide reaching, but not specific enough","I took a class with Prof Ruck at Boston University, and found it absolutely amazing. In fact a lot of what I learned in his class I later applied to my novel PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES (especially the story of Medusa). I use this book as a sort of encyclopedia, and it IS impressive how expansive it is, but some figures are just mentioned/glazed over. The book would really benefit by having a glossary/index of figures. That said, as a companion book for Prof Ruck's class, it's perfect as you can directly ask him to expand on anything, but as a stand-alone book, this isn't quite the end-all encyclopedia of mythology."
1,Terrible,The picture quality on this disc is unbelievably poor. It becomes apparent that these were recorded directly from the television using a VCR. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD.
3,The Classics...again...,"If you are a Popeye fan, chances are you already own these cartoons, probably more than one version. As with most Popeye releases, this DVD has no particular restoration or special features.If you don't already own these cartoons, the ""Arabian Nights Trio"" are some of the best Popeye cartoons ever made, and this version is as good as most.On this DVD are.""Popeye The Sailor Meets Sinbad The Sailor""""Popeye The Sailor Meets Ali Baba's forty Thieves""""Aladdin And His Wonderful Lamp""""Greek Mirthology""""Parlez Vous Woo""""A Haul In One""""I Don't Scare"" & ""Insect To Injury"""
5,Great book,a must have for your classroom if you are studying farms! my students chose to read this book over and over again during SSR. You will be impressed - buy it today!
3,"Great for Science... But No Way It's for Beginning Readers - a review of 'A Day at Greenhill Farm""","This is another good book from Scholastic. It deals with the many animals one might find on a farm. Cows, ducks, pigs, chickens, horses, geese, sheep and more, are all here and presented with eye pleasing photos.We see babies with their mothers, and have a chance to see what types of food they eat. (Baby animals nurse, of course.) We also get to see what a sheep looks like before, during, and after it is shorn.That said, there is no way that this is a book for just beginning readers. First there are too many words on some of the pages and some of the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated. Words like : orange, goslings, milking, through, webbed, oily, and noise.Three Stars. Good book with attractive pictures of farm animals. Should be of interest to older babies thru 1st Graders. I wouldn't purchase it as a beginning reader though"
5,The Best,"This is the best book on Witchcraft I have ever read. Instead of presenting the beliefs and practices, it presents the history and substance of the religion. Because it is not a ""Wicca for beginners"" book, but rather a ""Wicca for outsiders,"" the information within is completely free of fluff. It is also highly critical of Christianity, which is refreshing in this age of selling short your beliefs in order to avoid sounding offensive. This is the best book I have seen as far as asserting that Wicca actually HAS a historical basis."
2,Witchcraft is not a religion,"This book was terrible. The author engages in witch wars and bias opinions. Witch craft is not the Old Religion, because witch craft is not a religion, it is a craft. Wicca is a religion, but the author seems not willing to recognize that there is a difference between the two. Plus the fact that he constantly name-calls is simply irritating."
2,Not a useful reference,"Dr. Martello's vitriolic asides concerning those he dislikes are occasionally amusing, and the memoir dimension of some of the chapters is quaint. A reference work, however, this is not. The sprinkling of factoids one finds are overwhelmed by undisciplined, apparently unplanned, highly biased writing. There has to be a better book out there."
5,An extremely silly book!,"What is wonderful about this book is that it is extremely silly - I imagine it would appeal strongly to fans of Monty Python - it has very similar humour. On a more serious side I feel you would need to have more than a passing knowledge of English history (as it really was) to appreciate the blistering satire offered here.It is certainly very, very funny, but I guess you need to know what you're laughing at!"
3,May not be for everyone,"I ""rewarded"" myself with this book after finishing some more serious books on English history. But I found that it doesn't translate that well across the decades and the Atlantic. Surely there are many things I didn't get that others would, but other jokes struck me as labored and just not that funny. (""King Williamanmary"" is a good example.)I have no doubt that people who grew up in England would find this book terrific, but those of us who've read the histories rather than lived them may be at a loss."
5,1066 and All That,"Quite possibly the easiest History of Great Britain to read, and more importantly, understand.A great introduction into British history."
2,Not as good as I remembered it,"I read it many years ago and thought it was wonderful. Today, at 79 I cannot see the humor in it that I once did. I would not recommend it."
1,1066 and all that,"Unfortunately, the spine of the book was breaking and it was not in good condition."
1,Great disappointment,"I'd looked forward to receiving this ""cult classic"" little book, knowing that it had delighted generations of mischievous English public-school types. I guess it is what one ought to have supposed: a book full of silly upper-class-twit jokes. (Haw-haw! What will Master think!)Anyway, for us who are more prosaically born and raised, this book offers no reward other than insight into the childhood of a frivolous (if oxonian) class of recently and soon to be dead English aristocracy."
4,The Marx Brothers meet English History,"1066 and All That may not be classic literature, but the world is a better place, nonetheless, for its existence. It is a side-splitting and ground-breaking satire of the English history every English and American school child once had to learn. This is how I imagine Bertie Wooster would recall his history lessons. The authors have had many imitators, but their slim volume still stands among the best in its class. (On a personal note, my discovery at age 17 of this book was one of the pieces that brought me back to school after dropping out in 9th grade. The authors ability to cheerfully and publicly play with language and knowledge and be secure in doing so started me on a path that led to a graduate degree at Harvard and a doctorate at UCBerkeley.)"
4,Hardcover edition is way firmer than paperback!,"Ok I got this because its a classic. And its the 75th Anniversary Edition! I must say its probably the quickest hardcover read I've ever accomplished. Not one day. One EVENING - and I still have time for baseball!! AND a review!! About the book - well its just plain silly. But we historians can appreciate that its HISTORICALLY SILLY! That said, you need to know some British history to enjoy much of the silliness, some of which I do, but not really enough. However, if you read fast, imagine a British narrator - its pretty darn funny. You can also spot the influences on future humor of Monty Python and even Shrek. If you care! But you don't really need the hardcover, other than it's nice and firm. . ."
4,Still Funny,"It was funny when I read it as a child and it remains delightful. It helps to know the background, but one can still enjoy clean humor with a degree of sophistication. It's great for Anglophiles, but probably anyone younger than 50 who hasn't studied the history will put it down after the first page. Too bad."
4,Still entertaining and educational,Bought for my 17 year old as I remember loving it...still a classic? He is loving it. A classic investment.
3,"For me the value of ""1066 and all that"" was that it stimulated my interest in British history",The Illustrations were entertaining and informative. The listing of related lineage helped relate events. Looked at as entertainment it was a success. I have seen the Bayeux Tapestry and enjoyed seeing part of it included. What is great about it is how much history is covered in such a concise manner.
5,The Way History Should Be Taught!,"As a student of history, with the aspiration of eventually becoming a teacher of the same, I find that 1066 And All That is a laudable work. In a captivating, easy-to-read manner it connects various dates in English history in such a way as to make sense out of the otherwise useless jumble of facts so often presented by teachers. I highly recommend that anyone planning on teaching history read this book for inspiration!"
5,Two -album wonder,"I have FOND memories of these guys. They broke out with their debut album with the ""lips on a waterhose"" album cover, the same time I was coming into my dating ages. Although they only put out two albums, these were comparably the best albums of their era. (Tie between Breakwater and Heatwave) I notice mainly people from Philly, as I am originally, have knowledge of ""Breakwater"". WDAS radio had a great ear back then for great music. These LP's are timeless. I still pump these on the regular, and never get tired of hearing it. If you have never heard of these guys, take time to listen. You'll be glad you did. It was groups like Breakwater that laid the foundation for the Funk/Neo-Soul sound we enjoy today. All you youngbucks!! Take Note!!"
3,my favorite song f've found it,"As a child I can remember every pool and beach party in south florida given in the early 1980's somewhere during these parties someone would request the song ""SLPASH DOWN TIME"" . So naturaly when I got old enough to have a party I looked for this song but could not find it until I looked on this sight. Now my parties will be complete ."
4,DON'T YOU KNOW,"This is quite a group. More legend than anything else. People today will request Breakwater, but when you ask them for specific songs, they don't know. So let's take a lesson. If you want this disc, you want Splashdown Time or Release The Beast. If you're in a swing mood, you want Say You Love Me Girl. Don't you know."
2,Hummmm?,"They got some phat beats on here, but ya gotta be drunk to really get into it. I mean them lyrics. I can only see myself mad drunk late nite'n wit this one. But I'm thinking about swoopin it just for the......never mind. Amazon can keep this one."
1,so boring!bad excuse for a wrestlemania!,"there is no way this is even a contender for the best wrestlemania.this stunk.hogan vs. andre was so sad and slow. steamboat vs. savage was bad too. all of the other matches on the card were just as bad and maybe even wore. wrestlemania 3 is a real real bad wrestlemania. plus this has the world indoor attendance record with 93,000 fans. how could anybody even want to waste there time to go see 14 horrible matches. if you want some classic ppvs check out summerslam2002,and wrestlemania 17 and 18.there is no way hogan vs. andre is classic compared to the unsanctioned brawl between HBK and HHH at summerslam 2002. dont buy wrestlemania 3.please!!!"
3,Alright,"This pay-per-view was okay. the hogan-andre match was anticiapted greatly, and everyone couldn't wait to see the match. it went 12 minutes which is to short for a main event, and andre has no wrestling ability because he is to big. when hogan slamed him, it was weak. this main event was terrible and the wwf should have tried to make it better. the macho steamboat match was the greatest match of all time in my opion. it was just great. you have to see it."
5,This Is 1 Of The Best Wrestlemanias I Have Ever Seen.,"This Is A Classic Tape. It Had Many Classic Matches Like The Main Event Hulk Hogan Vs. Andre The Giant. The Best Match Was Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat Vs. Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage For The I.C. Belt."
4,It's the ppv that showcased the WWF to mainstream America.,"Greetings Wrestling fans. The main event was probably one of the top 5 or so in sports entertainment I have seen from the WWF. However, as with other Titan releases in the Wrestlemania series, it's evident some video editing was done in between matches that they could have left in."
2,This Book Would Make a Good First Chapter...,"I found this slight little book to be a tasty appetizer that leaves you starving for the main course. In other words, this book will help you identify yourself as the adult survivor of abuse, but when it comes to suggesting a course of treatment, the author's suggestions amount to little more than ""try taking small risks"", ""try trusting people who are trustworthy"", and ""good luck."" Well, as someone who has already spent 15 years and more than $150,000 in therapy trying to solve the problem, I found this book virtually useless. It's also very short, at about 100 pages of large type, half-empty pages, and some mediocre cartoons. I recommend instead Steven Farmer's book, Adult Children of Abusive Parents, which includes a detailed program of treatment."
5,a helpful beginning,"I'm a family therapist and have found this book helpful for several of my clients. I think that the fact that it doesn't have very many pages, has simple drawings, and is formatted in a non-threatening, non-academic way are some of the things that make it helpful. Many clients are overwhelmed by ""regular"" sized books. This little book is not overwhelming and has brought relief to the clients I've shared it with by helping them recognize that their reactions are normal given their experiences and that they are not alone. It is a good tool for beginning the healing process."
2,Disappointingly small,"I was hoping for a book of more substance - this book is like getting a brief synopsis of what things a person who has been abused may be dealing with. It doesn't do enough to help a person work through these emotions, or start to overcome them. I think that a person who is looking into self-help books in these situations is already aware enough of what is going on with them - they don't need a list! They need a book with tools to help them. This book does not provide that."
5,Extremely Helpful,I am an MFT and I use this book nearly every day in my practice. It is the most useful book about surviving childhood abuse that I have found.
3,Right cover - wrong book,"The cover says Outgrowing the Pain, but the book is Outgrowing the Pain Together. I'm keeping it because it will be helpful too, but really wanted the cover book."
3,A good read--but a bit short,"This is a simple read to get a survivor physical, emotional, or sexual abuse started. I found it a bit lacking in depth--perhaps because it is so short--and I did not care for the illustrations. Again, recommended as a good starting point. For a more in-depth examination of this subject, I found Miss America By Day by Marilyn VanDerber to be extremely compelling."
2,Outgrowing But Up-growing,"I thought it was a little immature. Not for older readers. It's for young teens to sit around and read to understand their ""so-called"" feelings about what they have experienced in the recent past. Or a older teen that just remember about a past experienced about at the ages of 4-6. Not for prelonged abuse survivors."
5,Essential resource,"This book presents a simple, friendly clinical resource that is helpful to therapists and as bibliotherapy for clients who are dealing with abuse."
1,Astonishingly Terrible,"This book was, as my title suggests, astonishingly terrible. Honestly, it's fit for children only. At BEST. I bought the kindle edition so I didn't realize how short it was until I got it, but it's extremely short, with lots of (terribly drawn) cartoons. Also, and more importantly, it is shallow. It contains advice that is essentially useless like ""take small risks"" ""take it slow"" ""think positively!"" etc. Bleck. A much better book is Toxic Parents by Susan Forward."
5,A great introduction to understanding why we act as we do,"The emotions of child abuse run so deep that this is a perfect book for beginning to explore how that abuse affected us and why we act as we do as adults. With knowledge, we can change our lives for the better. I have given this book to several family members who are equally thrilled."
4,For beginners,"After reading this small volume, I bought several copies for both clients and family members. It is a good introduction to abuse, especially for those who have been emotionally or mentally abused and are having a hard time acknowledging that abuse."
4,A great book for survivors,"This is a great book to help surviors u/s thier pain and heal. Good as homework, but need to make sure you are helping your cleitn deal w/ any issues it brings up. Would not suggest someone who has suffered from chioldhood sexual abuse read it on their own. Make sure you have a therapist or person you can trust tot alk to about all the emotions etc this will birng up."
2,Lacks empathy,"This book might have as well been called ""Sexual abuse guide for dummies"". Author's intention might have been good, providing the basics for ""beginners"" but how can one simplify such horrors as child sexual abuse? There is no deeper understanding in this book of what this experience can do to a person. A title of one chapter reads ""Ok, I believe it, now what?"". I cannot imagine anyone adopting such tone, whether having gone through it or knowing someone who did.Even though I don't like it, I am glad to see that it did help many people. But if you feel repelled by the style of this book as me, check the Secret survivors by E. Sue Blume. Amazingly intelligent and empathicly written."
2,Not Worth the Price,This book offered very little in terms of outgrowing the pain. It was too brief and had very little useful information.
3,semi-helpful book,"on the advice of a friend, i ordered and read this book. i am a survivor and only found it to be partially helpful. it covers a lot of material and would be far more appropriate for spouses/partners of survivors than actual survivors themselves,imo."
2,Not my first choice,"Very short and while the information is valid, it would have been the same had I just done a little research on the internet. Not worth the price."
3,Hmmmm,"I must admit I bought this cd for two reasons, it had a song I liked and it was cheap. There were a couple other wonderful songs on it, but for the most part, collected here is just so much noise. I highly recommend track Seven."
3,Fashion Mall,"My daughter received this HUGE toy Christmas from her Aunt. I finally got things just how I liked them and then I moved them around and then we re-arranged the stored. A couple hours later we changed it up a bit... We keep going back to this toy maybed because it's so big and catches our eye. Maybe because it's so much fun. My daughter is 5, my son is 4, and I am 27. All three of us are enjoying shopping and dining in the mall."
4,WOW!,Wow this is so cool I got this when it was $30.00and its great you can put the the shoe stand the manicanor the doll stand in the right spot and it lights upand plays music and even spins oh and you can alsoget cash at the atm you put the card inand the money pops out
4,Good read; good history,"I really enjoyed this book. What you've really got here is a well paced page-turner of a mystery (a good beach read if it weren't September) wrapped with themetic elements that raise it above your typical quick-read whodunit. Catskill is set in the 1930s, but it tells a story as old as America: the conflict between ever-changing groups of old timers and newcomers. Indians lose out to frontiersmen; old, local families are suspicious of 19th century Catholic newcomers, who in turn are compelled to ""scarify"" Jewish immigrants fleeing Hitler. Look at today's headlines and you can see just how enduring the story is. This is good history and good storytelling. I lean a whole lot closer to Kirkus' review than PW's: ""Impeccable plotting . . . heroes worth rooting for . . . A debut of rare accomplishment."""
5,Great mirror!,"Unlike most of these mirrors, which are plastic... this thing is heavy duty. There's definitely some heft to it, you can feel the weight in your hand. Reflection is nice and clear, great all purpose portable mirror. Wish I could say more, but it's just a good simple product. At $6 it's sort of hard to beat."
2,This is not a mirror.,"Mirrors (2) both arrived scratched and barely able to give a reflective image. It should be made clear in description of item that these are not mirrors but only reflective surfaces. They can reflect a light and project it a few feet away but would be impossible to use for shaving or other purposes for which one would want a camping mirror. If you are looking for a short range signaling device, the item succeeds (barely) and won't break like glass. If you are looking for a mirror to take into the wilderness, look elsewhere."
2,Too dull to be reflective,In was very disappointed with how dull the finish on this signal mirror was. Ive used signal ing mirrors before and they were much more clear and reflective then this product. I'm disappointed with this mirror!
5,It works,"I use this thing for almost everything, I use it under my pocket flap when ironing my work uniform so that the buttons do not push through the pocket. I use it as an emergency signal device, a travel shaving mirror, to look into places I would not or could not stick my head such as the wood stove to check for creosote. Its stainless steel so its extremely durable unlike the plastic chinese communist child labor sweatshop made junk. Unfortunately its not made in the US, its made in Canada, but I would much rather give my money to the Canadians than the communists."
2,CAUTION: SHARP,"When I opened this package, I noticed that the edges are extremely sharp. Luckily I was able to avoid personal injury due to my experience working with sharp metals.I contacted Coghlan's directly and they told me that they hoped this was an isolated incident, and was part of their process to sand the edges of the mirror before packaging.Due to the cost of this mirror, it's not worth it to ship it back to Amazon for a refund. If I bought this at a local brick & mortar store, it definately would have gone back.Otherwise it's a good mirror, not as good of a reflection as a glass mirror, but at least you don't have to worry about it breaking in your pack!I would have given this 5 stars, but due to the fact that this one missed the belt sander at Coghlan's, I couldn't."
2,"Dull, scratchy, and oversized","I can't recommend this product.About 3 1/4"" wide by 4 1/4"" long, it's too big to comfortably carry in a pocket.One side of the mirror, the ""back"" side I hope, has deep parallel scratches or machining marks. Not suitable as a mirror at all.The other side of the mirror looks dull and all scratched up as it comes out of the box, but this side has a layer of protective plastic on it. After removing the plastic, the mirror brightened some, but its finish is dull and scratchy. It has easily visible scratches from being polished with a too-coarse abrasive. They stopped short of the fine polishing step that might have given the ""mirror"" a mirror-quality finish.Better than nothing, I guess.I bought this mirror to replace an older, slightly smaller stainless mirror I'd had for years. That one (about 3"" x 4"" and pocket friendly) had a bright, mirror quality finish despite being traveled with considerably.They don't make them like they used to."
4,The Other Side of My Life,"An interesting auto biog....Deatherage provides suspence while he uncovers the secrets of his life...Joan Crawford and the Italian Mofia figured in his past. Adopted folks would find his ""roots search"" compelling."
4,James Buchanan,Another of the American Presidency Series and another factual but somewhat shallow look at an American President.
4,Good Service - but no product,"For whatever reason, my book wasn't delivered; however the seller was quick to refund my purchase, so I'd likely but from them again."
5,Very useful text!,"This book is an extremely useful resource, and I am an osteopathy student! I wouldn't restrict it to just chiropractors, anyone who works in manual therapy or even orthopedics could find this book very helpful! It's very black and white, which isn't always the case with the body, but it helps to pull you out of the grey zone of endless possibility :)"
2,Not sure if the author ever understood how a textbook should be formated,"For some terrible reason the NBCE decided that this book is the BEST book for diagnosis. I have no background at all in formal writing; however, even I find typo's and grammatical errors in every single chapter. There is no outline for each chapter. The material skips around continuously and you have to read the chapters 2 or 3 times each just to mentally reformat them into a logical order. Intro, body conclusion. It works for paragraphs, chapters and entire books. I wish the author would find a co-writer who could help him. Maybe Resnick is available.Update:I hate finding a problem without giving a solution so here is a better answer for RehabRehabilitation of the Spine: A Practitioner's Manual."
1,This book is very fake,"After reading ms youngs book A teen's guide to living drug free, I would think that she would have named it a teens guide to being a drug-e, this book realy had good points but I dont think a book can do the work to keeping teens sober they need more drug education class's in schools."
4,Interesting Approach,"In this book, Hale analyzes the reasons for the ethnic conflict between the Miskitu Indians and the Sandinistas. His approach is interesting in that he was constantly traveling between two very different sites on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. In all, it's a fantastic work that provides a history and insight of a population in Latin American that is not often given center stage in academia. I would highly recommend it to anyone studying the social sciences as related to indigenous populations, government/politics in Latin America, Latin American studies. As great as it is for content, it's also fantastic to read as a student because it really demonstrates the importance and role of methodology in conducting research. So whether you intend to go to grad school or simply are simply wanting to learn more about this, it's really a great work."
4,"A quick, fun read...","I loved Gingerbread by Rachel Cohn and Pop Princess was just as cute! For those rainy, boring days, this book is definitely something fun to read.Wonder is a small town, former child star who is just trying to find where she fits in. Her encounters with the different guys can be related to and it was amusing to see how she felt about each one. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Great Teen Novel,"Pop princess was an okay book.On every single page I was anxious to see what would happen next.I think I would have liked the book better if it had a different ending. The whole book was really good but I was disappointed by the ending. It almost seemed like I knew Wonder (the main character), from the way Rachel wrote the book. I enjoyed Rachel Cohn's other book but this one was a lot different but I don't think it was as good.Overall most of the book was great."
5,Great!,Bought this for a Christmas Present for my dad and he loved it!! I payed for standard shipping and it came in three days! It came exactly as it was described
3,tastes sugar free !,"i bought this cake mix along with the sugar free chocolate frosting mix and it's got a funny taste to it ,it could use some vanilla exract or something to make it taste better my suggestion to ya, dont eat it without adding anything to it , it taste terrible."
2,Slow and slower,"I picked this up because I listened to the Heep way back and thought this would be a pretty cool cd to own. Not much going on here. Very slow and this cd just didn't impress me all that much. I actually burned a copy for the me and now it's in the pile to be sold at the used cd store. This cd is for true Uriah Heep fans, not the occasional listener."
5,TRUE BEAUTY,"What can I say? This album is a proof, that Hans Zimmer is a living Genius! He is a Bach of our time! Beyon Rangoon is so beautyfull. I have never seen that movie, but I just love the score. It's one of the best albums ever!"
1,Inadequate Range,This product won't receive signals over 25' no matter what you do. Needs the new DECT 6.0 technology to work. Wrong frequency to try this with.
4,Wireless Speakers,I am satisfied with the wireless speakers. They work perfectly fine and as advertised. Not expensive and are a value for the money. They are portable and I can use them in our sunroomor the recreation room.
2,"Eh...Ok, with some really irritating issues","I just wanted a set of wireless speakers that I could hook to my PC and install in my living room so I could listen to the music on my PC without having to be in my office. These work ok - they're not stereo speakers, but they sound ok. You have to adjust the volume on each one seperately which is no big deal except that you have to re-adjust every time you turn them on. The on/off control on the remote doesn't work, so I have to turn each one on manually which is a pain in the neck. The volume control on the remote works fine, but again - you have to adjust each speaker seperately. The most annoying thing is that every 5 minutes or so, one of the speakers pops. The other one seems to work ok. Overall, I think my money could have been better spent."
3,Good value for price.,One of the speakers was not working out of the box on the first shipment. This was quickly rectified by Amazon. The second set worked flawlessly at various distances from the transmitter in and out of my home. The sound is a little on the tinny side but for a party they are wonderful.
5,Better tha anticipated,"I had a party for my co-workers at Christmas. I bought the speakers so I could have the music playing in one room and heard on the other side of the house. The second room was three rooms away from the source. It was easy to set up the speakers, and the sound was great! I was amazed because some of the reviews complained about the sound not being good with too many walls between the source and the speakers. I have been very impressed with the performance and highly recommend these for your entertaining!"
1,Very disappointing sound quality,I replaced a little wired $65 JBL speaker with these based on the positive reviews. What a let down. What a downgrade.The sound is all treble to the point you hear high end distortion or fuzz. I'm playing digital music to these babies and they like like a $5 tweeter.They won't even cut it outside.
1,Returned it,Reception was very bad. Could not get a clear signal. Music kept breaking up. I returned the product
1,Stereo?,"Bought these with the hope of extending sound to outside the house. Sound was plenty loud but the speakers are only delivering sound from one channel! In other words, left side only comes to both speakers, so if you listen to music with intruments mixed to the right side, you WON'T HEAR THEM. Very frustrating."
3,could be better,these speakers work well as long as they are close to the source. They do not work well through walls. But it's nice to have the wireless option.
5,This is our second order for these speakers,"Our original order lasted us over two years of very hard use.We take them traveling with us in our RV are able to move them outside and even to the beach. Last year we spent five months in Mexico with lots of humidity and sand. One remote controller does work for both speakers, just hit the Auto Tune at each speaker and adjust on/off or volume. We suggest you turn off the main transmitter when not in use, we didn't and might be the cause having to replace after two years.Enjoy"
5,Great quality for reasonable price!,"These speakers definitely exceed the speakers I have used in the past. Our tv speakers blast into the other living space. With these we can have peace in our household by repositioning the speakers. These are the best I've had as far as reception, volume and I so appreciate the remote control. Well made!"
5,Great Speakers for the price,"I was very happy with these speakers, just what I wanted, good sound quality and truly portable. Beats trying to wire up the house. A couple of things to keep in mind; If you buy these be sure to round up 12 C-cell batteries (yes, 12) this is how many it takes to power both speakers. They do come with a power cord if you want to use that instead. It is too bad that the tranmitter has to be plugged in, no batteries here so you can't use it dirctly on an ipod or the like. Speakers are plenty loud, my only complaint is the blue LED on the front, it is way too bright. You actually have to face the speakers away from you to keep from getting blinded, kind of like someone shining a lazor pointer in your face. All-in-all a very nice product"
3,Audio Unlimited Wireless Speakers,"I purchased this product for an outdoor children's party that I had recently and I was pleasantly surprised with the performance. They received rave reviews from many of the parents for of the the quality, distance, and price of the units. The one thing that we all agreed on was that it would be great to have stereo capability and bass/treble control. They are best suited for back ground ambience as opposed to upfront partying. Even if audio is pushed from a source with an equalizer the audio can be tinny or rumbly with bass enhancement. All in all however, they were a hit and we'll continue to use them happily all over the house--inside and out."
3,Almost got it right!,"The speakers work good. Sound quality is OK. Some static at 35+ feet. The remote can't initially turn on the speakers...you have to manually push the on/off bottom on the speaker...then the remote can control the speaker. Doesn't make sense. Love not having to mess with speaker wires though. Hopefully the next generation of the speakers will have better remote controls, less interference, and interface with the ones I bought."
3,Wireless interference,"I live in a downtown area and have a love hate relationship with these speakers. On one side, they have great sound, portability, and ease of use.On the other hand, they make loud buzzing noises when I mute my player. When working, I will get a call and turn on the mute from my computer, then the speakers will start buzzing very loudly for 1-2 second periods.Just an FYI, that if you plan on using these like computer speakers, realize that you have to turn them off in between each use or they will buzz at you. Also, you can't use the remote to turn the speakers on which sucks!"
4,Very Nice,"My children purchased these speakers for my husband for Father's Day...he loves them! They have great sound, great range and were easy to set up."
1,"Stopped working, manuf. won't repair or return",These speakers were pretty good while they lasted. They stopped working after 2 years with minimal use. After 2 years I did not expect a refund or exchange but was willing to pay for repairing them. Unfortunately I have to throw them in the trash. Don't waste your money.
1,Very poor sound quality!!!,Price is right. Setup is easy. Sound quality is the worst possible. I wanted to use these speakers indoor to carry the music from the computer in one room to the living room -- 35 feet away. I tried 3 different locations in the living room... The sound was horrible at each location. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
5,Sound where you need it.,This is my second set of speakers. Used the first in the Motorcoach. Tv was above the Dash and the volume was to be set loud to hear well in the living area of coach. These speakers gave me the chance to lower the volume or turn it off on the TV and hear a great stereo sound at a reasonable level where you needed the sound. The second set was purchased for the same reason. The entertainment center was 20 feet from the seating and viewing area. These speakers gave an alternative to the surround system in the room. A speaker on the end table instead of earphones. The option to adjust the volume with the seperate remote from the TV's volume control. So good the neighbors followed suit. Great buy to put the sound where ever you need to have sound. Take it outside great for the patio or deck.
2,Interference,"These speakers will not operate noise free. They are prone to unknown interference. I don't have any 900mhz devices in my home, but these speakers constantly pop while audio is playing. If the speakers are in very close proximity to the transmitter, the popping is minimized."
4,Not bad once you know what you're doing,"At first I thought there was something wrong with the transmitter but after I realized that the volume needed to be cranked up on the originating device - pc, stereo etc, the speakers worked wonderfully. I love being able to use them on multiple devices thru out the house."
3,Nod bad but mixed feelings on audio unlimited spk-velo-001,"I am truly torn on how to rate this system because it is complicated. We have found that we have to turn each one on manually which is a pain in the neck. The volume control on the remote works fine, but again - you have to adjust each speaker seperately. The most annoying thing is that every 5 minutes or so, one of the speakers pops. The other one seems to work ok. In the big picture, I think our money could have been better spent on a bose system. I just wanted a set of wireless speakers that I could hook to my PC and install in my living room so I could listen to the music on my PC without having to be in my office. These work fairly well - they're not stereo speakers, but they sound ok. You have to adjust the volume on each one seperately which is no big deal except that you have to re-adjust every time you turn them on. The on/off control on the remote doesn't work, so"
2,Less than I'd hoped for,"First of all, they do work. In fact they received a decent signal upstairs, through several walls. I didn't expect a lot of bass and didn't get it. And as mentioned in other reviews, the blue light they use on it is annoyingly bright. You have to turn it away from you and then it still lights up the whole room if there are no other lights. A little black electrical tape does wonders. However, what I didn't expect is sometimes when no music was playing and the speaker was on, it would squawk loudly, possibly due to wireless interference."
4,excellent product,"Setup was very simple. Pick the right plug for your music source, plug in the speakers and hit the buttons. Works very well when speakers are plugged in. We used for an outdoor party, so speakers ran on batteries. Location of the transceiver and speakers was more important in this setting, otherwise there was static through the speakers. Speaker volume excellent for an outdoor party. I would highly recommend these speakers."
2,"Fine for talk, tinny sounding for music","I use these mostly to listen to podcasts, so they work great for that. But if you are an audiophile, you will be as sorely dissapointed as I was in the sound. Very tinny and poor bass response. I have a pair of Advent wireless speakers that sound MUCH better with music; however, I haven't tried them with my computer as the transmitter accepts only analog input. The Audio Unlimited speakers were easy to set up with the computer and worked right out of the box. And yes, the remote won't work after ten minutes even if the units are on AC power. Dumb design if you are putting them out of reach. If they had named them Audio Limited, that would have been more accurate."
3,meh.,"Sure they work, but they sound like cheap plastic speakers. Talk radio sounds fine, music sounds like a bad car radio. Lower volume works best, too. Anything cranked sounds bad. I also agree with other reviews who say it makes no sense to mount these speakers too high, unless they're plugged into a power source with an on/off switch. Otherwise, using just the remote puts them in standby mode which still draws power."
4,Not bad for the price,I recieved this product before christmas and have been using it since. It has great reception anywhere in the house. I haven'thad a chance to use them outside yet. They are not extremely high quality sound but not bad for the price. Overall a good product for the money.
5,First Wireless Speakers to Work,"Excellent Product. Works as advertised. This is the third set I have owned and each were from a different manufacturer. Previous speakers would either drop signal and would loose signal frequently. They also did not have much range. These audio unlimited speakers hold the signal anywhere in our home, back yard and basement. They have excellent sound quality at all volumes. I purchased the optional third speaker but it is another speaker identical to these but without the transmitter. Although it adds nothing to sound quality in the same room it is good to use in another room. These do not operate as right and left stereo speakers. So one speaker can provide the same sound quality as two or three. You only need multiples of these speakers for balanced coverage of larger rooms."
4,Great Performance with Sonos,"Over a month and very pleased: I connected this to a non-amplified Sonos unit. We've dragged them all over the house and into the yard. Everywhere it's not practical to have perminent speakers. Haven't used them on bettery yet. I had read elsewhere that they were quite, but I don't buy it. For their size, they give excellent sound & performance."
5,Great for simulating surround sound!,"I originally bought these speakers to listen to music on the patio and throughout the house. I tested them with the LCD TV in the living room, placing one to the side and one several feet behind the seating area.The TV has good sound on its own, but when I got the wireless speakers levels balanced with the speakers on the TV, the overall sound was terrific! It really simulates surround sound well and we enjoyed the movie we were watching that much more.The remote is only active when the speakers are turned on manually - someone at Audio Unlimited really missed the mark on that one - but I consider this a good purchase and I'm thinking about buying a third speaker for the set."
5,Great system!,I bought my wireless speakers for a party im planning in August. I tried them out while I was doing some yard work. I plugged the transmitter into my computer in the house with all of my favorite songs running on windows media player and it worked great. It's going to be a good party.
2,Poor Sound - ok for light listening,"If you like any music with bass, these will not work. If you like to listen to music a little bit louder sometimes, these will not work. There is a lot of crackling if you do either. They're great for light listening while doing housework or sitting outside. I returned these because they won't work for what I was trying to do."
2,audio speech only,"Bought these as a present. After hooking them up, I do have to say that I was disappointed. These have a hollow sound to them. I would say that you could buy them for voice audio only . I would not buy these for playing music. I myself own a older pair of i think they are a research or ar something speakers which are much better, problem is they now longer make them."
2,Didn't work out for us.,"Works great when they are not squelching or cracking with interference. Like another reviewer said, it's not a little background static or interference, it is loud painful, disturbing squelching. Maybe we have too much wireless stuff operating around here (Internet, garage doors, mouse, keyboard, alarm system, phones). Who knows, but i can't get it to operate cleanly.Haven't been able to try it in a location with no other wireless disturbance, but overall they're not working out for my intended purpose."
3,Increase the sound,The speakers are easy to install and use but there is some noise when the volume is up. My wife didn't know they were there at first but heard the noise first and then noticed that sound from the TV was behind her. It can be adjusted and minimized but doesn't seem to be removeable.
3,Good speaker. Not well thought out powering up.,"The speakers are good quality. They are well built and sounds good for wireless. I can play music from a source anywhere in the room. The signal is very strong. I've never lose the signal before. The speakers are mounted about 10 feet high on the wall in front of my room. The transmitter is always in the back of the room. My classroom is 28 feel deep, so these speakers work very well for me.However, in order to turn the speakers on, I must manually go to each speaker and press the power button. I cannot use my remote to power on the speakers once they are turned off. In order to have them on, I have to either keep them on 24/7 or climb up a stool and use a stick to turn the power on. That is very poor design considering they are supposed to be wireless and should be able to be turned on using a remote, not physically push a button."
4,Wireless Speakers,The speakers are used in Legion bingo hall and work as advertised. I bought two sets and use four speakers and one transmitter. So far I am pleased with battery life and performance. Two speakers are within 25 ft and two are within 50 ft. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that one of the speakers has upside down wall mounting plate and I am not changing it.
5,Velosity Audio Speakers,The speakers arrived on time and were well packaged by the Amazon provider. This purchase added to an existing set of Velosity speakers covering additional rooms. We have been pleased with their performance for the price.
4,Good product,"I bought these for my old parents who have a hard time hearing the TV. I put these on their chair side-tables to give them ability to control the volume and on/off settings. These are NOT stereo, but for them it makes no difference. Sound is clear with no noticeable buzz or interference from other electrical sources in the room. I find the auto tuning feature to be much better than an old pair of Recotons they had where one had to manually tune, which was a royal pain. These also come in black, but these white ones blend into the decor better. Good product with no complaints so far."
1,Keeps making hissing sound,I'm very disappointed. These speakers are a good size. But for wireless... there are still wires everywhere unless you want to keep pumping sets of 12 batteries into these babies.I could live with that part. But the real bummer is that they make a loud hissing sound every several minutes. Even when they're not plugged into my computer at all. I guess I have to return them.
4,Very good solution for wireless outdoor speakers,"I bought these for a friend of mine who needed to quickly add outdoor speakers for some upcoming parties. Everything worked perfectly. The sound quality is better than I expected and improved even more when I mounted the speakers on a wall, which really helped the bass. Range was excellent and battery life is good as well. The only downside I ran into is that the IR remote has to be aimed pretty much directly at each speaker individually as I had them fairly well seperated and couldn't control them both at the same time. Not really a bid deal at all."
4,Great Speakers,I wanted some speakers for my pool deck without running wires. I researched many different brands and modelsof wireless speakers. Many didnt seem like they would have the range I needed. I took a chance on these and got what I was looking for. I have the receiver located in my basement and the signal comes in loud and clear by my pool a good 100ft. With great sound and awsome looks I am glad I chose these speakers.
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews and it seemed there were more pros than cons, so I decided to order these speakers. I was disappointed because they had a lot of static. I liked the design, but returned these speakers."
3,"good speakers, weak transmitter","Got these for a Christmas gift for my wife. Tried them right out of the box and they worked great for about 20 minutes then cut out for no reason. I adjusted the position and changed the channel settings like suggested, which then got them going again; for about 20 minutes. I am currently talking to Amazon and Audio-unlimited about an exchange for the defective transmitter; will update as soon as its resolved."
1,dont last,"They sound good, but stopped working after 1 year. Sent back for replacement, and the second set did the same thing. Now the company wont talk to me anymore!"
3,Wireless Speakers,"My dad is in a nursing home and is hard of hearing, he was bothering the man next door with the noise on the TV, we got these now the man next door and my dad are very happy!"
2,A series of disappointments,Just a note ...Switching between battery and powered requires that batteries be removed.The transmitter turns itself off during quiet sections of music.Power off returns the volume of full off requiring that you set the volume again.Susceptible to interference.In explicable audio drop outs (in addition to interference problems).I shopping for remote speakers...
2,Wireless speakers not in stereo,"I bought two sets of 2 speakers so I could add them to my patio and am disappointed. I have 2 of the four that have crackling going on in background after just a few weeks of use. These speakers cannot do stereo sound. Considering you receive 2 in a package you would think that they can be mono/stereo as a choice but no. The remote is nice and either remote works on all four speakers I bought so they are interchangable. The unit cannot be turned on by the remote, it can only be controlled by remote after manual power on button has been pressed which is annoying. If I had a choice now I would have chosen different outside speakers. They do have good sound as long as you do not turn the volumn up very high since they will start bust speaker easily."
4,"Nice Sound, Look Great!","I would certainly recommend these speakers as the sound is surprisingly crisp and clear. The bass is a bit weak but adequate. If they lose a strong signal from the transmitter and the sound becomes distorted, the "" Auto Tune"" feature remedies this with a push of a button on the remote. A terrific buy for the money!"
3,good,"These speakers are great for out door grilling or just listening to music in the kitchen. One thing though: the remote doesn't ""read"" the system as well as i would like, It doesnt bother me to the point that i want to get rid of it though. If i were looking again for a system in this price range I would still purchase this particular one."
3,"Good construction quality and looks, no deep sound","I am satisfied with these speakers. With the price that I paid for them, it was money well spent. The installation from out of the box was so simple ""...even a caveman can do it"". I installed one speaker on the deck and one on the patio below. With a bunch of guests at both places, the party was festive with music being streamed wirelessly from my daughter's iPod inside the house. Needless to say, they were the party savers.The construction of these speakers were very well crafted nice looking. The only issue that I have with them is the lack of the ""base"" sound , like some other wireless speakers. I would say that the sound was nice as to fill the air and made the mood of the party more festive but it was not good enough to dance to. They were smaller than I had thought from looking at the picture (one of the more reason why they lacked the base sound), but because of their size, they did not look out of place when hanged outdoor."
1,Seriously not waterproof,We bought these speakers to use on our brick patio. They lasted about 6 weeks. We don't think they are really waterproof.
2,Underperforming,"I tried using these from my basement stereo with the speakers placed on my back patio (about 80 feet away) and they get no signal. I've also tried these in my kitchen, directly above my stereo but they still have trouble getting a signal and you can hear static when music is playing.These might be fine if they were in the same room as the receiver but the stated capabilities of 150 feet and zero line of site limitations are an exaggeration"
5,Everything we hoped for,"We can definately recommend these speakers! They sound good, the reception is excellent, they are everything we were hoping they would be. The remote is very handy. One note: In the manual it says the speaker and the transmitter should be at least 7 meters apart. I emailed Cables Unlimited and they said that was a mistake in the manual. I can attest that it's not a problem. I have one speaker about two feet from the transmitter and it works perfectly."
2,good and not so good,"Though I was impressed by the basic function of these speakers, the sound quality and speaker quality was disappointing. It was Mother's day, I was strapped for cash and I saw these on sale so they fit the bill. I thought the range was o.k. I didn't expect the world from these as I only needed the signal to carry about 30 feet. The biggest downside was sound quality. Basically, the sound wasn't too bad until the night time came. When the air got heavy and damp, the speaker bass became muffled and distorted to the point where we had to turn them off. I did bring them with camping and plugged them into the laptop in the camper, that was kind of nice, but I didn't need a cordless application for that situation. I'm kind of a quality guy and if I had to do it again, I would spend the money to get something that is a lot more versatile."
2,Not quite what previous reviews built up.,I needed to spread music around my house for an upcoming party and found these mentioned here on Amazon. They were stated to be clear and wonderful sounding up to 200 feet away. Let me tell you they sounded shotty at <50 feet. Much static and often no music for periods of time. Big disappointment and waste of money!
1,Works as advertised but worthless,"I just hooked these up. They work as advertised (wireless, outdoor, etc). However, the speakers are very weak. The max volume is so low that the crickets outside chirp louder than the music produced through these speakers. They are useless in anything but the quietest of environments. Why bother. You would have better luck just turning up the volume on your speakers in the house. Since they were not sold directly by Amazon, I don't know what my return / refund options are. Hopefully I can get my money back for these pieces of trash."
3,I wanted better sound & simpler operation,"These speakers worked fine. The reception was good through two walls and about 40 feet away from transmitter. Very infrequent crackling static. But they are not stereo, they need to be turned individually on each time you use them, and as far as I could tell, you had to set the volume on each one individually each time you turned them on. Not bad for an outdoor speaker, but I wanted a higher quality stereo sound and simpler operation for my screen porch. I sent em back and ended up running speaker wire to my porch. Quite happy now with hard wired yamaha speakers."
4,"nice speakers, good sound, glaring blue led is only problem","I got these speakers after reading the good reviews. They work very well. I put one outside and one in my dining room to stream my favorite Pandora channels. The only issue is the incredibly bright blue light on each speaker. It's like the old Kmart blue light special. Why does it have to be so bright? Guess I can tape something over it. Small thing, because otherwise the speakers are great. Easy to set up too."
4,"Easy to Install, Sound Quality OK","I've been searching for some wireless speakers for my home stereo which is at one end of the house, and the living room is at the other end (over 20 feet away, through 2 walls) and I don't have a basement to run wires through to hook up ""real"" speakers. The speakers arrived in great condition and in a timely fashion. I got it all set up and turned on the power buttons, and all worked well. I'm not sure the remote is operational, though. I've read other reviews that said it wasn't. If you're an audiophile, you will not like these speakers, and I advise you to pay more for a higher grade. They are adequate for my needs, and I might even hook up the transmitter to my tv to get more of a surround-sound environment."
4,Does what they should do,"Works fine, like they should. It's unfortunate that changing the volume has to be done on each speaker at a time, but that's the way it goes. The box should include a quarter-inch jack splitter."
2,Dencent sound for the price,The speakers are okay for what you pay for. Overall I think the quality is okay. I did have a speaker blow out with in the first few weeks of having it but the other 2 have held up. I would maybe next time research more and spend the extra $$ for a better quality and customer service.
2,perry kenny,"works great until they cut out and lose the sound and the listener has to find the control and adjust the control until the sound returns. I have used a replacement device and experienced the same problem with both. Fortunately, when I explained the problem Amazon accepted a return on these items, speakers and sending unit with refund."
4,good product,I bought these for a friend at christmas. I ended up getting a set 6 months later to put on my xbox. Black tape over the blue led's works wonders. These speakers are great.
2,Disappointing sound,"I should preface my review by saying I got these off a clearance table at Lowes, so that may explain my dismay. I mounted these up high on an inclosed patio. The speakers are about 25 feet from the power source. Simply put, the the sound quality is bad. I have tried adjusting the channels, moving the transmitter, moving the speakers and the sound is marginal at best. I have noticed with reviews of wireless speakers that either you get a decent set or a pair of dogs, so it probably is advisable to buy them where you know you can return them. Adding to the other reviewer's comment concerning the remote; mine will not turn on with the remote, just turn off in the same stand by mode as the other reviewer. This means I have to get up on my tiptoes and turn them on, negating the 50% of the remote functionality. Overall I will be replacing these."
1,"Wireless, remote speakers","One of the speakers makes static noises when the transmitter is not activated i.e. not plugged into the audio output of the TV. Also, by design, the Remote Control does not turn the speakers on. They must be turned on at each individual speaker. Speakers are very sensitive to interference."
3,But I really do like them,"I bought these to replace my KLH wireless speakers. The KLH's definately had better sound and volume but the signal would never 'lock on'. Now these speakers are tall (in profile) therefore tend to be alittle unstable. If you have large hands, it's not too bad to try and hold the speaker to use the panel switches. If you have girlie hands, watch out! You'll have to give it a bear hug to use the panel buttons. The rubber feet are ok but there is not enough weight to keep them from sliding across the surface or tipping over. (minus 1 star) The frequency lock works great with an unobtrusive transmitter. The sound is not great but adequate & very omni-directional. I find the volume very non-linear. So be careful late at night. I contacted Cables Unlimited to purchase a second remote (best way to handle volume) and was told the remote is not available for purchase. (minus 1 star)I hope this helps."
2,Too Much Interference,"Sound quality is OK, but no matter what I did, the speakers had crackles and sound dropouts while listening. I bought these for my back porch, but after messing around with them for 4 or 5 hours, I decided I had to send them back. I am now going to go through the hassle of connecting wired ceiling speakers."
5,Good product,"It's a funny story... my mother likes to listen to the radio while she cooks. My brother and I were home for thanksgiving and couldn't believe the poor reception she was getting. ""I know, but this is what I want to listen to."" They had recently purchased a new radio, but it didn't help. My brother's an engineer, and tried everything he could think of to improve the reception. No luck. He and I brainstormed and eventually decided that wireless speakers to play the audio stream from the Internet was the ticket. We bought these, and we are all living happily ever after.I just turned 40 and my mother is old enough to be my mother. :) She's very competent with her computer, but she's far from a gadget-o-phile. She set these up with a bit of phone help from my brother. I gather it was perfectly painless. I saw the speakers in action at xmas time, and they sounded great and seemed 100% intuitive to use. In short, just what we were hoping that they'd be."
4,Wireless Speakers working great...,"The speakers were easy to install and the quality of sound is great. We have them in the kitchen, making it easier to hear what's on the TV without blaring the volume on the TV. It is also nice to be able to move the speakers around as the kithcen is rearranged."
5,Does the job,"If you are looking for some high quality high sound fancy schmancy speakers then you are so in the wrong price range. :-)However, if you are looking for something easy to set up/operate and puts out a good quality sound then I suggest these. When setting them up make sure you don't set them up near any cordless phones as that tends to run interference and of course the further you get away from the base the more reception issues you will have. But if you keep them within 100-125 Feet of the base they work great. I set my dad & stepmom up with these on their 5 disc cd changer and they love them. They have music all over the house and only have to have it on in the rooms they want to listen to it.You do have to manually power on/off the speakers which can be a tad bit annoying but for what you are paying it's not much to complain about. :-)If you are looking for something fancier I suggest the Wireless System Cisco has out."
4,Good for the price,"I have my laptop in the downstairs office with the wireless transmitter attached to it. The two wireless speakers are on the next floor, and the usually work great, but I do occasionally have problems with them fading in and out while a song is playing. Overall, great buy, simple hookup, great sound quality!"
2,Inadequate Volume + Monaural + Beeping,"Just got these speakers, unpacked them and tested. Now I am returning them. They work fine as per the other reviews - clear sound, no cracking or hissing. They even work all the way up on the third floor. However, the volume at its max is totally insufficient, the music is not in stereo, and as I walk around, the speakers emit a high pitched beep when I pass through specific areas of the room. Recommendation: if you buy these, buy them as a fill for the bathroom or hallway, not for general listening in a family room, porch or bedroom.** EDIT: In User Manual under Technical Specifications: ""Output Power: 2 x 5W"". This is also in the product description somewhat cryptically as ""(10H x 5W)"""
1,Horrible clicking noises and not in stereo!,"I purchased these in the hope they would work as a good speaker system for my outdoor theater. Upon opening the box I was a little surprised to see how cheaply the speakers, transmitter, and remote were made. Never the less I proceeded to set them up using AC power instead of batteries ( I didn't have 12 C-cells) and test them out. The first problem is that the transmitter doesn't sent out a stereo signal! Beyond that problem I was getting a intermittent screeching, clicking noise that would not go away by hitting the ""auto tune"" button. So I have packed this speaker system back up and have returned it."
1,Don't Waste you money or time!,"I purchased these speakers for my garage which is about 20 foot from the radio that the base to speakers were plugged into, however it could not keep the signal or it had a poor signal. I returned them to amazon."
2,Beware,Purchased to use with TV. Quickly found out that the volumn on the TV needed to be above 50% full volumn before the transmitter would stay activated and transmit to the speakers. Even when transmitter was active the range of the volumn control for the speakers is very limited.
3,Nice Speakers,These speakers work very well at a low volume. Nice for outside and areas like the bathroom and kitchen. Easy to set up.
5,Great,"I had a set of these speakers, and my son admired them, so I was able to find them on Amazon and ordered them for him, and we're both happy!"
1,"Damaged product, poor customer service","When my speakers arrived, one worked and one did not. I went through the trouble-shooting steps, trying to make the speaker work every which way. No go. The company does not provide a phone number to address these issues. You have to correspond by email. In response, they asked me to send back the damaged speaker and so on and so on. It became easier to just send the whole thing back to Amazon, which is what I did."
5,grerat buy and surprising sound for size,This was a great buy both for the price and the sound quality is great also especaly for the size of the speakers.
2,Great Product just didn't work for what we wanted,This product didn't work for us because we wanted to have the ability to have the television muted at its location and move the sound to another part of the room. The sound from the speakers was fine.
2,waste of time and money,"These speakers sound good when they work. There is an input thresh hold problem with the transmitter. I had these hooked to a TV for an elderly person to be able to hear their programs with out having the TV so loud it blasted everyone in the next room basically they were sitting on either side of the viewer within 25 ft of the transmitter. The signal light on the transmitter would blink on stay on for 20 to 30 minutes then go off for 1 to 3 hrs. I could unplug the transmitter, the sound on the TV would come back to full.There fix was to max the volume on the TV but it made no difference. They even stated that the transmitter needed to be plugged into the Headphone jack on the TV not the Audio out on the back of the set which was ridiculous. There tech support was threw e-mail only no quick fixes there on any solution. Thank you Amazon for your return policy that is one of the many reasons I shop with you."
1,Look elsewhere,I bought this thinking it was the solution to my wireless surround sound answers. It isn't and the connections are for plug in to TV R & L and won't mute when you mute your receiver. The auto adjust for volume and sound sometimes works and when using the remote to turn them on only works some of the time. I have hooked them up to another TV without using a receiver and found them to be good for direct connection.I recommend this product: Rocketfish(tm) - Universal Wireless Rear Speaker KitModel: RF-WHTIB
1,"Poor sound, crackle heard even from 2 feet away",I was very disappointed by these speakers and had to return them. There was a steady crackle heard unless the speaker was right next to the transmitter. It sounded like a radio station that didn't quite come in... What a waste of money that I had to pay on shipping!!!! I'm surprised because of how many good reviews there are. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone based on my experience.
4,I agree,"I read a few reviews before making my purchase. Yes, these speakers are not fabulous, but for $99, they are great! One thing to add, when they are on and transmitting, there is a very bright blue light. It's too bright. I put a sticker over them. But again, for the price, I'm happy."
2,Not a well built product,"I have bought two of these audio systems. The first one worked for awhile and then a loud tapping noise started coming from one of the speakers. I tried everything - pressing the auto tune button both on the speaker and on the remote, changing the location of the speaker, switching from batteries to power cord... nothing worked. I threw the system out and bought another one thinking I would have better luck. No so. The second one keeps losing the signal and the music shuts off. I have it connected to my computer to play Pandora and to listen in another room.I didn't give this system 1 star because as I am writing this the signal is on after fiddling with the connection cord to the computer. This is going to be constant work to keep the music flowing - not a well made product - it is made in China - need I say more.... It is a great idea to have cordless speakers, just wish it worked as advertised."
1,don't buy these speakers,"My friend had a set of these speakers and loved them; she bought me a set and I paid her back. At first, they seemed to work, but within a few months the transmitter device simply would not turn on when plugged in. I didn't know where the speakers were purchased and didn't have any receipt, so in the trash they went.FYI: if this is an issue for some, these speakers were manufactured in China, and in the user manual it states, ""this product may contain chemicals listed in Proposition 65 that may be known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm""."
1,Just another piece of just made in China,The transmitter just simply stopped working after only a few weeks. These same speakers are sold under a few different brand names...good luck trying to get in touch with the manufacturer. Complete waste of money.
2,Static makes these useless,"I want to like these and I hate to have to deal with not liking them, but at least one of them crackles and pops incessantly to the point where you have to turn it off. I use them in our shop to create a pleasant atmosphere and nothing is more grating than crackling speakers! I love the idea of them, but if the sound isn't clear, I can't use them."
2,Leevegas,Every thing was good except one of them last only 10 months. Very disappointed. I only use themonce a week.
1,cannot use these speakers outside powered by electricity,"I returned the speakers. The instructions said that they cannot be used outside with the charger, i.e when you used them outside the power has to come from the batteries. I wanted to use in my porch and did not want to have to change the batteries constantly."
2,not consistent,when it worked it worked great. but then all of a sudden the blue light would not go on to keep the signal. had to return.
2,Disappointed in the VOLUME :-(,"Bought these speakers as a Father's Day gift a month ago...(I have some just like them and LOVE them!)However, once my dad got them hooked upthe VOLUME only goes so loud and then the TV also has tobe on a higher volume too. Kinda defeats the purposeI was needing them for. The gift was opened and hooked upAFTER the 30 day return policy - so guess I'm stuck with them ???:-("
4,Wish it had USB and was powered by USB antenna...,Else this thing is GREAT for the price. I have my little station set up for my computer when I am ready to rock out. Perfect for desktop. Put your speakers around your house and its great. No fuzz... Only gets interference if you leave the speaker on without a signal going to it. Great product!
5,wireless speakers,These were easy to set up and do exactly what we wanted them to do.. using them in a camper.. when the air conditioner runs it is very hard to hear the tv 15 ft away.. and we had to turn it up very loud.. so we have them mounted close to the space we are sitting at.. one near the computer.. and one near the couch.. the sound on the tv is turned down.. and we just use them. They are perfect. Also after looking around amazon had the best price.
4,Wireless Speakers,"Speakers are easy to connect and they work good in transfering audio signals without static or loss of signal. One item not mentioned in any advertisement is that the audio frequency goes up to 12,000 Hz. Also, the base is a little weak. Other than that they work fine and eliminates the need to run wires in the house."
5,I love these speakers,"I bought 3 sets.. My neighbors bought some as well. One afternoon, we heard our music AND their talk show at the same time. I changed the channel on my transmitter and all is just fine.Some friends came over to play games at New Years, 2 of them asked for the link so they can buy them as well."
2,Tired of sub-par Popeye DVDs?,"Me too! Well, here is another one. Sigh...If you are a Popeye fan, chances are you already own these cartoons, probably more than one version. As with most Popeye releases, this DVD has no particular restoration or special features.None of these are particularly standout Popeye cartoons, coming from Famous Studios' ""cheap gag"" era. The ""& Friends"" part is from the inclusion of a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon and a Foghorn Leghorn cartoon. These are not ""Popeye meets..."" cartoons, but entirely separate.On this DVD are.Spooky SwabsPatriotic PopeyeSpree LunchNearlywedsAncient FistoryTaxi-TurvyPopeye For PresidentAssault and FlatteryFright to the FinishBride and GloomGopher SpinachGrowing Pains (starring Foghorn Leghorn)Fright From Wrong (starring Casper the Friendly Ghost)"
3,Cheap plastic box,"The bell is a standard school bell. Works great. The box is not made of hard plastic. It is made out of cheap, flimsy plastic that file folders are made of. Kind of a disappointment for the price."
1,Not a book- one big advertisement pamphlet,"I bought this book on clearance at a bookstore thinking I could use the pictures in it for decorating inspiration. It has a lot of beautiful pictures of renovated and decorated homes, but none of the ideas carry over to a person living in an apartment or with a small income. Also the fact that the pages are not very wide but the binding is very thick makes it difficult to view. It is more of a photographic ""phone book"", a weighty and awkward business card file - a great reference tool if you happen to be one of those people with large budgets wishing to redecorate and don't know where to start. Everyone else, don't waste your money."
5,Help for Daily Prayer,"This is an excellent aid for daily prayer published by the Irish Jesuits, whose web site, sacredspace.ie has a similar aid on line."
3,"Good Overview, Short on Archeology",I will say that like most of Ballard's books this is nicely laid out; good sized and with excellent photographs & drawings.Most of the book is taken up by short histories of the various battles that make up the 'Guadalcanal Campaign.' This didn't leave much room for the exploration of the wrecks themselves which gives you a rather rushed feeling despite the good background history.Perhaps this would have been even better as an expanded two volume set.
5,Just the kind of book I like.,"It's like the old Time-Life books, lotsa pictures to go with well written text. I had not appreciated the naval difficulties associated with the Guadalcanal battles. Wow! It must have been quite a thrill to find all those sunken ships. Ballard is definitely one of a kind."
5,Bang on Target,"When I heard of this video, it was at the last minute to get a video for a show at church. I had not heard anything of the content, except that it was good. When I viewed it surpassed good, it just hit the spot. It ministered to me as a single young male, it brought tears to my eyes. I was thrilled by the Annointing on the Sista and how real her presentation was. It truly is a must see video, those at church who really need to hear that message was not there, but it will be showed again and again until those person view it. Thanks to Prophetess Juanita for allowing God to use her in such a powerful way. It is what the churches need today."
4,cool flick,This movie was cool I liked it. I'll give it 4 stars because I didn't fall alseep on it like I do most low budget films
3,"Good ""B"" Movie","This was an interesting movie. The plot wasnt original, but the storyline unfolded gradually with a few good twist, ie Sticky Fingaz actually being an undercover cop.Movie kept my interest and was defintely worth the purchase."
3,goombata,not the best book i have read but not the worst.despite the book being flawed because it finishes before the final prossecution. it does offer a few good chapters and also throws down some opinions that s contradicted by other sources.like who did whack his body gaurd near the end of the book.some good photos but not exactly a work of art. if only he good have waited to find out what happened at the final prossecution then he could have definately called the rise and fall of john gottis crew .there are definatelly better mob books on the market but if you do want a different veiw then it may be worth checking out.
3,Goombata book review,"John Gotti( Dapper Don), I feel is the cause for the downfall of the Gambino crime family. In ""Goombata"", it shows how Gotti loved the attention from the Press and Media. He alone made the FBI and RICO chase after him. John Gotti wanted a flamboyant life-style, which is why he was number one target among organized crime leaders. John Gotti broke the number one rule in La Cosa Nostra, the secret life.I like the tone the author set. Chapter after chapter I wanted to know what John Gotti was going to do to become a known man within the Gambino family. ""Goombata"" is a fast and terse biography. This novel would've been the perfect biography but the author, John Cummings, did'nt make the novel long enough. He could've coverd more about his coming up among the ranks years. Also, there was no clear resolution because when this book was published, John Gotti was on trial for racketereering charges that he later was found guilty for. Overall rating, three stars."
3,ok,"goombata is not a great mob book.it tends to explore too much of john gottis childhood.the book is about the rise and fall of gotti but it didnt really float my boat.it has a couple of good chapters but the rest are average.on one occasion it tells how gotti,i guess you can say killed the man who accidentally ran over his son.the man pleaded with gotti but john didnt have mercy for the man.he just dissapeared but we all know that gotti got him."
1,Crap,"This is awful stuff - it goes way too fast, and the amount of facts that are wrong is unbelievable from two so-called mob experts. Among the wrong facts - the circumstances surrounding the Frank Costello shooting, the McBratney murder, the Westies alliance, and much much more. For the real Gotti story, try Gotti: The rise and fall."
5,A clairvoyant in dangerous times,"Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a great performance as a soldier that discovers his psychic powers after a headinjury. Hanussen's career is on the right path until he starts predicting that Hitler will be the next German chancellor and until he ridicules a Nazi party member during one of his shows. Although fascinating, since this is a real-life story, the movie isn't long enough and I found the ending too abrupt. I wish there would have been more to watch."
5,Great price for hours of fun!,"This is hands down the most played with toy in our home! I bought this along with two sets of people and my kids have built castles, barns, boats, trains... you name it they can build it! Great variety of blocks. I would buy these again and again."
5,More is better,Contains a really nice quantity of bricks. Enough bricks to make houses or for two kids to build their own little creations. I would not buy this alone becuause it does not come with any larger flat pieces... so it is a great addition to significantly boost up other sets.
5,This is the best deal for Duplos that you'll find anywhere!,"I searched at several local stores and online for the best deal on Duplos and this set is by far the most value for the buck. These are the basic building blocks. I find that my kids play with these more than the fancy sets that have people and cars and cartoon characters. This basic set helps them use their imaginations more than other sets in my opinion. 144 blocks is a TON. Such a great deal and of course, they are LEGO so they're going to be around for my kids and my grandkids!"
5,great product,Exactly like explained. Quality item too! Very happy with our purchase and we will purchase again in the future for a gift.
4,Better than megabloks,"I got these after having bought 2 big bags of megabloks. The issue with Megabloks is that they are unable to stay together in stacks for children who are strong toddlers. So I would recommend duplos for either strong children, or for kids who are devloping strength too. because it is hard to get the large base blocks separated from some of the smaller duplo blocks, the child may get frustrated with that aspect. but its easy to distract them. kids love these toys.i kept a couple of the duplos for visitors and donated the rest.we like duplos a lot. i also got the car-plane kit which is so cute. it is a lot of fun to add to a tower which also has eyes (from this kit). lots of smaller pieces. lots of options. nice. i think i will get a few other smaller kits tho for variety in my sons duplo play."
5,Love it!,We really love this book. It is casual and easy going. No insincere talk or boring chapters. Each chapter is well thought out and has a great point to make. Also it is based in the real world that I live in. The authors understand the issues that normal people deal with in a daily grind because they too have done it. My boyfriend and I read a chapter to each other every night or so before we go to sleep. It has become a very nice bonding and laugh time for us. We love it!
4,Wonderful Book!,I bought this for my husband. We are new parents. I'm reading it now. It's wonderful. I learned so many great & useful tips from this little book. It is succinct & very well written; it's even humorous at times. I would recommend this book to new moms & dads.
5,tips for all dads,I saw this book at an airport book store and bought it for my son in-law who was soon to be a new dad. I read it and saw what a great purchase I made. He read it and loved it too. Helps dads be great husbands and fathers. It's written by a man who really understands the guys needs. Guys this is a must read.
2,25 Things. It's a good thing the Sears brothers have day jobs.,"25 Things was a trite little book, composed mostly of filler. I bought a whole book, but all I really nedded was a pamphlet to get this information. It was not funny or entertaining, like the authors claim. A funny baby preperation book is ""Be Prepared; A Practical Handbook for New Dads."" It has all of the same techniques as 25 Things but is less biased and easier to read."
2,Runs both hot and cold,"The Syndicate book is rather good, attempting to show that not all Syndies are evil, and giving a fairly decent explanation of the Bottom Line. The history is good. This book seems to say that the Syndies are even less ""magickal"" than the rest of the Technocracy. It's not a bad book, but it's not as good as the NWO book.Then there's the book that brings this rating down. This is not the Void Engineer book; it is the Void Engineer Barabbi book. The narrator is a barabbi, and the entire book is tinged with her Nephandic taint. I hardly think that a barabbi is the best narrator for an overview of a Convention, unless one is assuming that over half the Convention is barabbi. (I do not.) I think this is a miserable book, completely lacking in useful information.I do not recommend this book, unless you're like me and want everything WW puts out for the Technocracy. If you aren't, go buy _Guide to the Technocracy_ and Neil Postman's _Technopoly_ instead."
3,Strange Format,"I am a big Ernie fan, so that helps, but overall I was disappointed with this book. Basically you read three pages and then at a point where there really isn't a logical conclusion, you stop and turn the book over and start reading (three pages) from the back. The cover says it is ""two books in one."" My son, who is one, seems confused by it, since he is just now learning about turning each page and looking at them. I just find the format awkward. The story and the pictures are cute enough, but of all the books out there, I probably would have gotten a different one."
5,Must have if you have to replace the old duct,"This is a great product. It makes the replacement of dryer duct easy. I spent several hours but could not fit the new rigid aluminum duct to fit with the fitting. I scratched my forearms in several places because it was in a tight space. I gave up but decided to search the internet to find an advice. Then I found this thing and ordered it immediately. After I got it, the rest was easy. It took me only 15 mins, may be less, and its done!!! And I am not a handyman. Recommend those who has to replace dryer duct to get this before you start. It will save you time.The only con is I found it on the web and had to pay shipping etc. and wait for more than 1 week while I could have gotten it at the home depot near-by."
2,"Nice Idea, docking tabs broke","Great idea, didn't work though. I had one tab break on me the first time that I attempted to dock the 2 pieces together. The appliance installer broke off the other 2. Since the dock was already installed to the wall we ended up screwing the 2 pieces together. Not what I was looking for."
3,Pedifix bandages,"The Pedifix bandage works well with one exception, it does not remain in the same spot. The bandage moves out of place as I walk, which is very annoying."
1,dont waste your money,Provided very little if any support for me. honestly i think a tight sock would have been as effective. Was hoping this would provide a solution to my problem and it never did.
1,didn't work for me. low circulation,nerve damage/flat foot - did nothing unless it was high on my foot and then completely cut off the circulation.
1,This Musak Stinks!,"I have some of Lorie's other music and have really enjoyed her lyrical playing and phrasing. However, this CD is tripe! It all sounds canned, the arrangements are shallow, and the other instrumentalists just aren't that good. Everything else just distracts from what she's good at--playing the piano beautifully. Only buy this CD if you have no musical taste or if you're Lorie's mom!"
2,Birder,"The product wasn't what I was expecting. The wire leading to the battery pack is only 3-4 inches, so ends up dangling from the vase. The lights are not very bright and aren't noticeable unless the room is dark. The fiber optic threads are somewhat stiff and won't separate easily so virtually impossible to get a fan shaped design, they cluster together."
2,Silly,Silly . Silly. Silly. I do not know why i ordered this . Waste of moo la. So it was a crazypurchase.
3,IT IS A NICE TOY BUT THE MUSIC IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE,MUSIC IS NOT WORKING. WHEN PURCHSED WAS WORKING GOOD. PASS TWO WEEK AND THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC WAS BAD SO I CHANGE BATTERIES BUT STILL DIDNOT WORK .
3,OK TOY,THIS IS FUN AT FIRST BUT GETS BORING FAST. THE MUSIC IS ALSO ANNOYING AND THE COINS ALWAYS DONT REGISTER. DONT WASTE YOUR MONE ON THIS AND BUY SOMETHING COOLER.
1,Don't waste your money,This was bought as a gift and when the package was opened the plastic was cracked. When the new batteries were installed the game did not operate at all.
3,uuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh......,"WEll i got this product for christmas and my dad got this once too. BUT my dad doesn't have it any more because it broke. I thought we could give it another chance because i have young siblings who used this roughly. when i got it, it was fun for about two minutes! The left and right stick didn't work at ALL! I usually give VERY possitive reveiws but i don't really know about this one. i'd like it better if the left and right sticks actually worked:( What i do actually like about this is that you can really win candy from it and it's not like the machines you find in stores. overall i gave this a three."
4,I Almost Didn't Buy This Because of Negative Nancy Reviews,"I was very concerned about ordering this based on the negative reviews posted here however my son has been dying for one of these.I opened it up as soon as it arrived to test it out, expecting it to be broken, but it was packaged very well with the buttons cushioned and after I inserted the batteries, it worked just fine. The claw moves back and forth, goes up and down and opens and closes as it should.The music that plays with it is very loud and maybe I'm just getting old, but I find it kind of annoying, but I am sure my son will love it and will be the favorite birthday gift."
4,Good product,"The claw was something my son has been asking for since early this year. I got it for him for Christmas and he loves it. It does not give him somthing every time he tries. It makes him work for it and be patient...just like the ones in the stores. It even came with play money to insert into the machine. I suggest lighter items inside for easier grabbing, but I like this item and so does he."
1,"Poor, Poor Quality!!!","My daughter wanted The Sweet Machine she saw in Linens-n-Things, so when I found The Claw at Target for $12 less I scooped it up. When I got it home, it appeared to have been used. The coins were loose inside and there was some sticker residue on the top. When I turned it upside down to get the coins out, a small plastic gear and a screw came out. Needless to say it did not work. I returned it to Target and got another one that I made sure was still in all of its original packaging. Well, this one worked for 30 whole minutes before it started malfunctioning! Everytime you'd push the up lever, the game would stop. I changed the batteries just in case, but no luck. I called customer service at Target and she said that this was the 4th Claw machine she had personally refunded and I could bring it back for a refund. This is a poorly made product. Don't waste your money!"
1,Broken,Righ out of the box the up/down lever did not work. It's like it is not hooked up at all. The other two levers work fine. Kind of sad because it does seem like a fun toy . The rest of the toy seems pretty sturdy. Since I am never home for UPS to make a pick up my 17 year old is trying to repair. Probaby a mistake but at least he is enjoying himself.
1,No grabber for fun,"Worked wonderfully for the first few coins. Then the main switch broke inward and nothing worked anymore.Made several attempts to repair it, but to no avail. POOR MANUFACTURING!!!!"
4,Arcade Crane,Nice toy for a child. Came on time and in working order. The candy that was recommended was too hard to pick with the crane claw.
1,arrived broken,"My son saved his own money for ""the claw"" and was counting the days for this to arrive. When we got it, the amazon box was is great condition. The ""claw"" box inside, however, was smashed and had a large hole through the middle like the fork of a forklift went through it. The plexiglass was broken into shards on the front and back of the machine. Even on the outside, this product was obviously damaged, yet still shipped it out in this condition. Frustrating. I read other similar reviews and would have thought Amazon would have stepped in to get this problem fixed."
4,Loved this toy!,"Bought as a gift for a little boy for Christmas. He loved it!! It works great, no problems at all."
2,Pretty much junk,Not durable. Didnt work that good. Cheap made. Overpriced and it was pretty much junk. Would not reccomend buying this toy
4,So far so good,"Got this as a joke/for fun for my boyfriend. He loves it and we have had almost no issues with the claw not working properly. The chain got stuck once and we couldn't get it to pull up for a minute, but we tilted it around a little to get it unstuck and that seemed to work fine. All in all I feel that I got a good deal."
2,What you see in the image is not what you get!,"The item I was shipped appears to be a generic and not the actual ""The Claw"". The toy itself has no branding on it and the box says, ""Candy Grabber"". It also did not come with any toy tokens. Some of the local retailers sell the real ""The Claw"" game for less than $20. I'm sending this one back."
3,"Not bad, but needs to be bigger","Many aspects of ""The Claw"" are good -- the controls work well enough to meet the price point expectation.This toy would be great if it were about 2 to 6 inches taller. As it is now, very few toys can be placed in the bin to allow the claw to move over the top freely."
2,Cheaply Made,The Claw does not work very well. The gears seem to slip preventing the claw from raising. When it does work it's very difficult to grab items. I would not recommend this item.
1,Doesn't work...at all.,"My daughter was SUPER excited to get this toy. Too bad, it doesn't work. I tried 2 brand-new sets of batteries and still nothing. She tried and tried to get it to work. Sat there, putting in coin after coin and nothing. Broke her heart, and mine."
2,Didn't work out of the box,"My 7-yr-old son requested this The Claw as his major gift from Santa. Right out of the box on Christmas morning it didn't work properly. The left/right switch worked only to the left. Trying a new set of fresh batteries didn't make a difference. This was very disappointing, especially on Christmas morning. We'll try to have it replaced, and see how that goes..."
2,Looks nice but didn't work,This product didn't work when we opened it. We aren't able to do an exchange but I will reorder to give this company another chance. I will upgrade my star rating if I feel the new one is worth the purchase. I am able to return it for a refund so that is good.
3,gift for a friend,"Loved this thing. A little platic-y, aned my friend said the music cannot be turned off and drove him crazy. that was the hilarious part!"
5,The Claw,"Bought the Claw for my grandchildren at Christmas. It was a HUGE hit. They all loved it! I was a little leary because of some of the bad reviews, but so far we have had no problems. The only negative thing I can say is the parents have complained about the loud music because the kids are playing the game ALL the time. I ended up purchasing four games. Two for one household. Turned out to be a wise choice as the 4 year old and the 7 year old wanted to have their own. I would recommend this product. Lots of fun!"
1,Horrible Quality,"It was totally fun...for a week! First, one of the knobs came off. I kept playing using my finger to push the lever inside. Then, it stopped going down every time. I kept playing by pulling it down. Then, it stopped closing. (It didn't close all the way anyways.) I couldn't play with it anymore. I went to get rid of it but I couldn't get the candy out because the opening was too small to get my hand in. I am never buying that again."
1,Disappointing Christmas morning,"My daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas. She was really disappointed that it didn't work at all. We put batteries in, turned it on and nothing. We tried for an hour to get it to work and it wouldn't."
1,Don't buy,I purchased on Amazon and it was used buy my 3 kids over the age of 10 for about 30 minutes before the chain became separated from the claw. Impossible to fix with out unscrewing many screws and taking it completely apart. So it was packed back up and sent back to Amazon. NOT WELL MADE at all. Don't waste your time like we did. Just a junk toy.
4,kids love it!,We bought this for our 7 year olds birthday. All of our kids love it and it has been surprisingly durable! Fun toy just a little loud!!
4,This toy is so fun!,"I have had this claw game for one day. I really wanted it. I put small candy and small toys in there like Hershey's kisses and Reeses pieces. This toy is so fun because I win most of the time. The claw works fine when I move it forward and backward and up and down. The only thing it can't pick up is rubber balls because they're too round and other stuff gets in the way. The only problems are that the claw makes strange noises when I move the claw left and right, sometimes the sensor doesn't register when I win, it plays loud music all the time, and it uses batteries up quickly. To make it work better, don't over fill it, and uee fresh batteries. I would recommend this game."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"My son has been asking for a candy claw machine for nearly three years now! I just couldnt see spending the money on something with such poor reviews; however, I was pleasantly surprised this evening. We filled the machine with trinkets that we had around the house and a few suckers. It worked! The claw picked up small cars, suckers, bouncy balls and even a patch that needed to be sewn on his badge jacket. The machine is definitely a game of dexterity and he and his sister had a blast. The music that plays for each round is a bit annoying, but, so are most kid's toys."
1,"Bad company sells defective, repackaged toy","After the first Claw arrived broken, we ordered a second Claw just in time for our 7 y/o's birthday. It arrived in a tampered looking box. And BROKEN. I'm sure another angered customer returned this machine just to have them repackage it and mail it out again. This company does not care who it disappoints. Apparently they hope no one will go to the trouble of returning their machines and so they can make a profit. We are outraged."
3,"You get what you pay for, but not bad if you can fix stuff","I didn't expect a ""real"" carnival claw machine, I knew it would be plastic and maybe not perfect AND I wasn't disappointed with that expectation. It came with the left to right action not working. Usually this kind of thing is a matter of a short or a pinched wire - so I took all those little screws out and and tested each wire. yep, one was pinched off - I repositioned, tested it again, hot glued it down and put it back together. It works Ok for what we bought it for - a Carnival themed site at a music festival. The music is annoying but hey, it's a game and stops when it runs out of time or you win, whichever first so it's livable. Not bad for the $, but if I didn't know how to fix it, I would have been really ticked off - they need to quality check the items before packaging and shipping. REALLY, how hard is that????"
1,Poor Quality,The concept was great and the kids loved it but one of the controls broke within the first half hour of use so unfortunately it went into the trash.
1,So Disappointed!,I was excited to buy a crane game for my son for his birthday since he is really into them these days--even if it's just a small game. I knew he'd love it! I just received this in the mail today. It doesn't even work. The crane won't go up or down. The gears must be off. I'm so disappointed! I'm sending it back tomorrow. Don't waste your time or money on this thing.
4,Claw machine,"I love it! I bought it with Christmas money, so at first I wasn't sure if I would risk it for something with a three star average. It worked fine. I found that I can use up to one small stuffed animal(2 or three inches). The candies that work best are tootsie rolls, jawbreaker, wonka gobstoppers, or jolly ranchers. I also put in two toy balls which worked well."
4,My son insists on posting a review as he loves this!,"My kids think this claw game is awesome. I was extremely hesistant to purchase because of the bad reviews but am glad we did. We do treat it carefully, we never fully pull the chain that moves the claw. It is still working after a month - and we selectively choose the small toys that go inside the machine. The music is also not as loud as we thought it would be - we do put the game over carpet to help dampen the music. But for someone like me - who hates loud toys - I did not find this one offensive at all. I would recommend this toy!"
3,It's fun the first day!,My son loved it the first day. It is very hard because the claw doesn't grab things well. My 11 year old got frustrated and hasn't played with it since. I think a younger child would give it up a lot quicker! But it is what he wanted and if he hadn't gotten it he'd still want it really bad. So I guess it made him happy!! That is what counts!!
1,Waste of Money,"My son wanted this toy for Christmas, but he was very disappointed when it broke on Christmas morning. He only got to play with it for about a half hour. The gears are very cheaply made and most of the outside is plastic, not very durable for kids. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
2,Review from an 8-year-old,My son Gabe asked me to post this:I got this for my birthday a few years ago. It worked for a week then stopped going forward. And the music is so annoying you'll hear it in your sleep. I don't think you should spend the money.
3,Broke after a few weeks,"My son got it for Christmas. He played with it on Christmas Day then put it on the side. A couple of weeks later, he went to play with it again and said that the chain that holds the claw just broke. He doesn't play roughly with it. He uses it the way it should be played with. All he has in there right now is small pieces of candy. He is very disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This would be a cute novelty item that is never actually used, just used as a show piece, it is cheap piece of material that won't work like you half way think it will. buy it if you just want to give the kids something to tear up quickly."
5,Kids love this toy!!,"I was reluctant to purchase this for my daughter because we had seen some unfavorable reviews, but she was insistent! She and her friends love this toy. They set up a carnival with other toys, but this one is the main attraction. They are able to get prizes from it, but it does take time and patience, just as the real game does. The hole that the prizes are released into is small, so pencils, pixie stix, and things that are long are not good prizes to use. One thing to note is that Jolly Ranchers and other sweets do attract ants!! We did have a small issue with that. Lesson learned!! Overall I am glad that we purchased this toy. It is used daily in our house and generates lots of excitement!!"
1,michmom,DO NOT BUY!!! I read the reviews on this product and decided to get it for a xmas gift for a 9 year old. They played with it for over 2 hours and didn't get ONE piece of candy out of it. We put really light candy in it and filled it up so the claw could reach the candy and it never even worked! Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!
2,Listen to what people are saying!,"I decided to ignore the reviews on here claiming that this item broke after hardly much use and purchased this as a gift. After roughly 30 minutes of use, the machine would not turn on. We changed the batteries, still no response. What a waste of a great idea for a gift."
3,5 BAD THINGS,"This claw machine has 5 bad things. First, the music is so loud it gets on peoples nervs sometimes. When you can not turn it off. Second, the plastic is so cheep it has a discusting smell, it brakes off so easly. Third,the claws chain can get stuck and it is hard to fix. Sometimes the claw turns it self ff then you have to turn it off and back on. Fifth, the claw is so stupid, the coin slot you can put the edge of a piece of candy and the claw will still work. Over all the claw is still a great game to play. If you are going to give this as a gift you will not be disipointed."
4,The Claw,Got 2 of these for my nieces for Christmas and they just loved them. As long as you dont overstuff the machine and keep the toys light it works great.
3,The Claw,"Bought this for my 8 year old neice and she loves it! We undid the packaging & loaded batteries before we gift wrapped. We also added the ""prizes"". Can't fit too much and the prizes need to be small enough for the claw to grab. Seems to be rather delicate so not recommended for anyone who plays too rough."
4,The Claw,"This was a last-minute request from my grandaughter. The item arrived in advance of the estimated arrival date. Didn't realize it did not come with toys/candy, but had fun filling it. Also thought it was like a piggy bank and that she would use real coins. These things didn't matter to her at all and she and her siblings are really enjoying this game. Her mom said she ""squirrels"" it away until she is ready to share it with her siblings."
5,Braves Windshield Shade,This is the only site I could find where you could get a Braves windshield shade. When I received the sunshade I loved it.
5,Truly Inspired Music,"We have had this recording since it first appeared nearly 15 years ago. It contains some of the most inspired music ever written and performed. We have used it for meditation, prayer, and going-to-sleep music which really promotes a peaceful night's sleep! Our only disappointment is that there were no further recordings by the Carmelite Nun. She is a superb musician and composer and her talents should be more available through recordings."
5,FLASHBACK CITY!!!,"This is got to be the best CD ever! Out of 20 songs, 18 were some of my favorites back in the day. If your an ex-disco babe like me,(and now a suburban housewife) you'll be hussling in your living room with or without a partner! Gosh, some of these songs were out when I was still in highschool (yes, that long ago!) and this CD made me feel like it was just yesterday that I hussled the night away!"
4,Fun Stuff,"This music brought back great memories .. especially cut 17. Girls... it was never on the radio, but we danced all night to it at the clubs. Same with #5, 18 and 17.Worth it."
4,non-scary Disco soul,"Soul music lovers; don't let the dreaded word ""Disco"" scare you off getting this very solid compilation. This CD contains some supremely soulful tracks, some with a subtle disco beat, and some that are even more in a dance groove. But to my ears, it's all soul and all pretty darn good. I mean, look at some of the names in this lineup: Jimmy Ruffin, The Tymes, Lyn Collins, Eddie Kendricks, the Jimmy Castor Bunch (and thankfully it's not one of their silly novelty hits), First Choice, BT Express, and the Trammps. Some solid soul to be sure. Even if you weren't burning up the dance floor in the mid 70s (the material on here spans the years 1972-76), you'll still enjoy the grooves ... and more importantly the tunes. I really think this era of ""disco"" was more focused on songwriting craft and it shows. Some great stuff on here."
4,Not so rare disco,"The songs were very good. I notice that a lot of 7"" singles are on this and its companion ""Super Rare Disco Vol 2"". This appears to be a very common problem with these disco series. I feel that it's because the labels are trying to cram too many songs onto one disc. This genre is more suited for more discs than for more songs per disc."
4,No Complaints,"These cables do what they are supposed to do. Overall great value for the money, arrived 2 days after ordered, and very solid for such long cables, I do recommend."
4,You people dead?,"Does nobody watch Renoir these days? A gentle, yet dangerous epic about farming life in America that reveals the bone reality of man and his relation to nature and his family."
3,The Southener,"This is a movie that would not appeal to anybody under the age of 60. It was a time during the great depression.and unlike the ""Grapes of Wrath"" it didnt have the actors nor the story that seperates the two.It was back when there was no welfare. Nature was the only thing that provided for your needs and if it was a bad season you were just plain out of luck.I lived during those times in Alabama and I can tell you it was a bitch. Hunger and misery everywhere. You didnt go to a doctor you just lived thru it or died as so many people did back then. Every winter, pneumonia took out one or more of a family. People got up at 400 to feed the livestock and went to bed at 8P.M. The only heat in the dead of winter was from the fireplace or the wood stove in the kitchen.The most exaciting thing was the arrival of a Sear Roebuck catalog for the changing seasons, you could turn the pages and look and want and then look and want again."
2,The American South As Seen by a French Director,"If you loved Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game, this movie is probably not for you. Directing in a language and culture not his own, Jean Renoir drifts toward the corny and stereotypical in this melodrama about a desperate Southern farmer and his beautiful wife. The dialog is especially artificial, spoken by handsome, well-groomed actors out of central casting. If you're interested in the authentic southern or Appalachian poor, see Walker Evans's 1930s photographs. Stick with the Renoir movies shot in France."
2,Pull handle separated from bag in less than 2 months,"Purchased this bag in mid-November of 08' for my daughter in 5th grade. A week ago (less than 2 months) the aluminum handle pulled right out of the backpack. The bag has only been used for 6 weeks, as Christmas break was 2 weeks of non-use.The bag seems very high-quality. The bag itself is well made. However, I will definitely not purchase another.Kudos to Amazon for issuing a replacement bag immediately. If the bag were not replaced I would have purchased another brand."
2,Wheeled Backpack Handle Broken Already!?!,"I just purchased on 7/24/2007 for the 2007-2008 school year and already the handle on the bag is broken. I like the material and the straps, but this shouldn't be happening already."
3,very good bag,"I bought this bag for my last two semesters in college. After I bought my laptop, and put heavy textbooks in a regular backpack, carrying the backpack around was really taking a toll on my back. So after i purchased this bag, my back pain was relieved because its on wheels.The only thing I would improve about this bag is make it out of waterproof material for when it rains."
2,Disapointed with arrangement.,"When I purchased this music book, I had high hopes that the arrangement would be the one that Vanessa would use if she was perfoming. Just flipping through the book, you can automatically tell that she had NO involvement at all in arranging these songs. They all suck.I love Vanessa, she's a wonderfull musician with a talent that the rest lack. But this book isn't the best. If you're looking for a good arrangement, look elsewhere."
1,"Misleading, tsk, tsk.....","While I do not own this CD, I have seen what is on it. What the maker of this disk does is go to a DoD website, download (for free) all the publications there, then segregate them according to subject header.If you purchase this, all you will get is Service and Technical Bulletins, with an occasional Technical or Field manual. While they may help you to identify some US ordnance, and might help you to understand the EOD mission, there is nothing on here applicable to EOD Technical Operations. It's mostly Ammunition Servicablilty Procedures and white papers.The actual publications that reference the identification and rendering safe of ordnance, US and foreign, called the 60 series, are Classified Confidential Publications, and (hopefully) will never be for public sale.....PS - It's spelled ORDNANCE, not ordinance."
1,WORST EOD MANUALS ON CD-ROM,"A few Army FMs , but nothing of importance to an EOD Tech. The Title is misleading!!!A waste of money"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,It is obvious that the publisher has no idea what they are doing or talking about on this particular subject matter. Mis-spelled title. -Marine Corps EOD Tech.
1,Waste of space,This is hardley applicable to EOD operations. Very general basic ordanance information
4,Glabal Trekker/Scotland,"The DCD is a good one; well mapped out and shows many of the top regions of Scotland along with a some local flavor here and there. The hostess is a wee bit of a twit, and as the program progresses, there is a little too much emphasis on her, but if you ignore this, you will certainly enjoy the scenic beauty of Scotland."
1,TOUR SCOTLAND WITH A SIMPLETON,"Globe Trekker: ScotlandWonderful subject...breathtaking scenery...and a completely daft host! You will watch this DVD primarily to decide if the host,Megan Mccormick,is really as silly and immature as she seems.She has the ability to make even the most interesting segment ""cringeworthy"" by her antics and inane commentary.A hopeless travel DVD."
2,Superficial travelogue of Scotland,"This program is a very superficial view of Scotland's people and its sights and sounds. It's very ""touristy,"" touching on the standard cliches, such as haggis and what folks wear under their kilts. The program sadly offers little depth on Scotland's history. For example, William Wallace is mentioned but depicted only as the Braveheart film character. The accompanying music is by no means rousing; non-descript filler type that doesn't scratch the surface of Scotland's musical depths. As mentioned by others, the female host is annoying, and she even mispronounces some of the Scottish place names. If you are looking for a good travelogue of Scotland, I would recommend looking at other options."
3,Killerspin Nitrx-4z Table Tennis Rubber,Thanks very .I am really very impress with your article.Its very good and is very easy to use. I like it
3,Interesting.,Frankly speaking I did not finish this book.It stipulates clearly from the very outset that it is giving all the basics ; i guess that even the basics are not easy for everyone...
2,I Wouldn't Go Here If I Were You,"When I got this Cd I Thought this album would have the total club feel. Man, I was wrong. The best song on here is the Motiv8 remix to Jellyhead and basically the rest of the songs are crap. There is no soul, the lyrics make no sense whatsoever, and the music is mediocre at best. The vocalist of the group put no feeling into the music and didn't really add much of anything to the music. They should've auditioned for the spie girls. All in all I wouldn't spend 50 cents on this album let alone anything over $10."
4,Very good book for all ages really.,I listened to this book on audiotape and it was nice. I suggest everyone pick it up.
1,Won't stick to window,I like others found this hygrometer would not stick to my window either. So I don't recommend it unless you're willing to tape it to your window. I don't live in Canada but live in Southern California--so cold weather isn't the problem.
4,Not bad,"For such a cheap hygrometer, it is pretty accurate and is adjustable so that it can be calibrated. Good buy!"
1,Doesn't work,The first one I received was stuck at 60%. The replacement I received wouldn't go below 65% but went up to 90% when I tested it on a wet towel.Amazon refused to send me a third as they have had a high number of quality issues on this.
2,hygrometer will not stick,"Item will not stick to window :( Price good, but can't use it if it doesn't stick. Would not recommend."
1,What an INFERNAL product!,"Don't ever buy this item, or else you'll regret. I first bought this from Amazon.com with confidence, which I thought that it would work as expected. But when I received this item, I was definitely dissapointed with the cheapy built quality and unusable at all. Luckily Amazon.com's best customer service had granted me with full refund for this infernal item. Million thanks to Amazon.com for their best customer service."
2,Cheap and inaccurate,"My one quarrel with this hygrometer is that it isn't very accurate; it sometimes has a 5% difference from the actual humidity. That could be because the face of the dial is just a sticker.The suction cup doesn't suck very well, either. I ended up having to put some glue on it to get it to stay up."
1,It doesn't stick to the window at all,"This has a suction cup that is supposed to stick to the window, but I have never been able to get it to stay on the window for more than a few hours at a time. Don't buy this piece of junk!"
2,Hygrometer,"this item would not stick to the glass as it was intended to do and I really don't think it is measuring the humidity in my basement at all, as the dial has barely changed since I started using it."
2,Did not stick,"The whole point of this product is to easily view the relative outdoor humidity by ""sticking"" this thing on the outside of a window of your home or office or where ever. After cleaning the window and dampening the suction cup of the gauge, this thing would only stay on the window for maybe an hour before falling off. Tried different methods, areas with no success. Skip it."
4,Confused at First,I didn't read the title carefully because I thought this was a cardio video. It is a strength training video. I'm OK with that. It wasn't too too challenging but it was pretty good.
3,Good News / Bad News,"The good news is the Vibration Reduction and Dorsal Protection (what is a dorsal anyway?) work as advertised. The bad news is the pads are so thick it makes griping any power tool I've ever used problematic - so you end up making a trade off - less vibration but your hands have to exert additional pressure because your grip gets more awkward.I still plan to use them when I knock out a section of brick, but other wise they stay with my hammer drill. Maybe if I had XL hands instead of L hands the comfort level would be different. Please note by the same token, I doubt these gloves are usable by anyone with M or S sized hands."
4,I'm under influence!,"The second album from french group Cassius is even better then the first one, once again this electro dance group proves they are among the best groups of their kind out there. A mix of Electro/Synth and Funk/Soul, lots of guest artists this time but most of them are doing it well. Hi-Water and Sound of Violence are both funky with cool beats, Room tone and Telephone Love also goes in the same spirit of fresh original electro music. Jocelyn Brown appears on ""Im a woman"" a more soulish song and rapper Ghostface Killa on ""Thrilla"", interesting to mix rap and dance, a good result from my point of view. ""Protection"" is a relax song, like Royksopp, it's slow but good. In the end of the day this album is a hit a good mix of diffrent styles and one of the best elctro albums of last year! let's hope for more."
3,"fairly mediocre, lacks the energy of 1999","this is a pretty lackluster effort, but it still has sparks of the wicked funkiness of 1999. Sound of violence is a standout, but not many others are."
4,It really helped,"This book really helped me to centre more on my relationship with Jesus and less on the duty side.It refocused me on the love relationship that He died to establish with each of us individually.God wants lovers, for He IS love.Thanks Tommy for this inspirational book."
5,finding favor with the King,I received this book in a matter of days in perfect condition. It is an incredible book and would recommend it to those interested in learning how to approach God.
5,"An Excellent, Handy Resource",It's too bad that this excellent resource is out of print. I bought my copy when it was first published in the early '90s and have consulted it regularly ever since. Each article is clearly written and is nicely balanced -- neither too advanced nor vacuous. Editor David Henderson deserves loud applause for assembling such a stellar collection of essays.
5,Beautifully clear and concise,"This book is perfect for anyone age 14 and up trying to understand economics.Too many economics books muddy up the waters with dry bones statistics and other irrelevancies.This book presents the Big Picture of what REALLY matters...money flows,monetary policy,interest rates,wealth confiscation by inflation,free trade,right of contract,riskless society, etc..all of it in short little,to the point essays..like bullet point articles,explaining everything in language designed to impart knowledge..not to impress the reader with how smart the writer thinks he is.No wonder that Book Whatever in the review took issue with it's exposing of the failures of Marxism..they don't like to be reminded of them and of the misery their policies have perpetuated on mankind."
2,The Booker Prize (Upper Class Novels Only Please),"Dull. Dissapointing. Snobbery is evident within the narrative - i.e. from the writer not the characters, - ranks below officer are as a seperate species. Some of the images created within the trilogy are worthwhile and memorable. Strange to see the author obviously relishing the deliberately crude language of the extremely graphic sex scenes, and yet shy away from the more extreme graphics of trench-warfare, but perhaps this is intentional; showing we are more disgusted by descriptions of sexual extremities than by the extreme violence of war. Billy Prior suddenly becomes a Poet in his diary. -This fluency does not fit with his earlier appearances. Generally, I thought, a very average book. Can't understand why she felt the need to make a trilogy of this story - it may have made one good book. Still, glad everyone else found it so brilliant. Maybe I'm just thick."
4,I've Met Several South Africans On My Travels,"And they were all arrogant and predictably wrong about their views on life. This dude must feel really embarrassed about his review (which has gone worldwide) so let's give him a break. After all, he's human too and just in need of a little tlc. This book rocks, dude."
5,A wonderful but shattering culmination to the trilogy,"This book shouldn't be read without its two predecessor volumes, which introduce and develop the two central characters, one based on fact (Rivers), one totally fictional (Prior). The sense of impending doom grows inexorably as the plot unfolds, but the ending nevertheless has power to shock."
5,Great war literature -- great book,"Everyone living in the 21st century who cares about the future of humanity -- not to mention fine literature -- should read this extremely skillfully written, emotionally powerful novel of The Great War. Pat Barker has perfect control over her material, and manages to write with power but never goes over the top or gets melodramatic -- a tough thing to do when you're writing about any war. Starting gently, subtly, even humorously, the book builds quietly until it reaches its final, wrenching chapters. It's a touching, compelling, beautifully told tale that deserves a worldwide audience. I can't wait to read more by Pat Barker!"
1,should not have been filmed,i dont know how this made to the shelf. if i had been at the show wouold have walked out! save your money.i would have been ashamed to let this get out if i was adam hunter.i would have given it no rating but they wont let me.
5,Mary's flowers,Beautiful illustrations. I used information to design a Mary Garden in memory of my mother Margaret McGill. I also gave a copy to an Irish Catholic friend named Mary.
5,wonderful book,"anyone planing a Mary Garden, this book is a must! everything you need to know. it dosen't overwhelm you with too much information. i am a backyard gardener, not a botanist. it is enjoyable and informative at the same time. i purchased one for myself and love to give it as a gift."
4,Great garden club program!,"A friend sent me this book. She has a lovely Mary's Garden. I used it to prepare a garden club program on Mary's Gardens and meditation gardens in general, which included several plant legends. The program was a BIG hit! I also presented this book as a gift to our garden club president. It's a beautiful, informative book. I love it! The daily meditations are a bonus."
2,You can do better,"In comparing this with the Random House Unabridged Dictionary, the Random House wins hands down. In terms of ease of use, ability to copy and paste the definitions, features such as anagrams, etc., this product is lacking. I recommend that you buy the Random House edition."
2,One of the worst dictionaries on the market,"This has to be one the worst dictionaries on the market. The definitions are outdated and often offensive, the art work is not informatrive and is not of good quality. Don't waste your money. Pick up the new American Heritage College Dictionary, fourth edition -- thats a dictionary worth its wieght in gold!"
1,lacking raison d'etre,"in today's environment with easy access to giga hard disks and the Internet, there is no reason to exist for traditional dictionaries, especially such a bleak compendium.if forced to choose among printed materials, i would take American Heritage eye-candy for entertainment, and Oxford American Dictionary And Thesaurus for everyday use.i simply have no idea how to do with huge resources and splendid lexicographers in Webster's.at least for me, this is not an expected mentor."
2,permissive,"Perhaps I am a bit old-fashioned in my lingual tastes, but I find this new edition way too permissive. As as example of this permissiveness, I cite its pronunciation of the word forte, a person strong point. Traditionally, the word is pronounced as the word meaning a military stronghold, fort, would be. But, for some reason, some haughty idiots pronounce the word as fort-AY. This pronunciation applies to an entirely different word meaning a musical direction. To confirm the fallacy of these dolts, I consulted with this dictionary, only to find that you could pronounce it EITHER way. Oh, how William Strunk and Noah Webster must be rolling in their graves"
1,Do not buy this lemon!,"As a dictionary? It's a dictionary. But, it offers a little ""convenience"" thig-a-ma-jig that turns out to be very difficult to understand and impossible to employ. I'm referring to its ""M-W Link"". And, it is exactly this facility that is needed most when using a word processor. My wife, who is a virtual whiz with our computer is really confused. There's nothing good I can tell you about the ""M-W Link"". My advice is to stay away from this one. Go to another source."
2,BROADWAY CAST SURPASSES THIS,"Now, I know all thses songs are on the Broadway cast but B'way cast has so much more to offer. You get to understand the story much better plus it has a whole lot more songs. This concept CD is good but not as great as B'way cast. Though if you are a die hard RAGTIME fan this should be in your collection."
3,A really good recording for a nice show.,"Ragtime is not then best show on earth. Far from it. It has its moments, its beauties and its flaws like any show. It also has a nice main title that is weaved throughout the show to make it catchy (hmm... does this sound like Andrew Lloyd Webber to anyone?). Most of the ballads (I have Wheels of a Dream in mind) are unmemorable and don't have any particular point to them. The best of the ballads is Back To Before because of its meaning: it shows Mother suddenly changing her old opinions of submission- in fact, becoming a feminist of a kind. Wheels of a Dream, while constantly toted as the ""big"" song, has no meaning to it- in fact, it's about a car for God's sake. And doesn't He Wanted To Say remind one of Les Mis? The whole show is full of symbolism and motifs that can easily escape the normal viewer and it takes a few listens to get them all. It isn't quite as emotionally drenching as some would have you think, I know I wasn't crying at the end."
5,[Darn] the Lion King!,"Stolen, thats what it was Stolen! The Lion King over Ragtime, it was supposed to be a no-brainer. Ragtime is the greatest musical that has shown itself in the past 10 years. It ranks with The Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables. The story is brilliant, the music is phenomenal, the lyrics are fantastic. You can't get any better than Ragtime! ""It was the music, of something beginning, an Era exploding, a century spinning, in riches and rags, and in rhythm and rhyme! The people called it Ragtime!"" Breathtaking.Highlights:The PrologueCoalhouses SoliloquoyJourney OnHenry FordYour Daddy's SonOh forget it they are all geniusWith powerhouse performances by Brian Stokes Mitchell, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald, Mark Jacoby, and others, this is a sure hit for anybody!"
5,"Broadway has been waiting over a 100 years for ""Ragtime!""","Wow! Perfect! Amazing ! Heartbreaking ! Inspiring!...just some of the words to describe a perfectly recorded score from the best B'way musical in years! I fell in love with the show when I saw it on B'way in April. Shortly after that, I purchased the OCR and haven't listened to anything else since! How can any other ""American"" musical possibly compare to this show? It's perfect from beginning to end. The voices in the original cast are beyond comparison. If you can't feel anything when you hear Marin Mazzie sing ""Back to Before"" or BSM sing ""Make Them Hear You"", you should have the pulse checked. These songs will be listened to and honored by muscial fans fifty years from now, and the Lion will be a distant memory."
5,Ragtime - The Musical (1998 Original Broadway Cast),This is exactly what I was looking for!I'm not disappointed in the slightest. Well worth listening to.
3,Singers amazing...Sound quality poor,"The singers and actors are amazing!!! However, there were some songs that were muffled, or you can only hear one singer clearly and the others sounded far away. I would think there would have been better microphones when they recorded, especially for a Broadway cast. But...Ragtime itself is so fantastic that I was thrilled with what I did hear. The CD is worth buying if you are willing to overlook a few songs that were not up to par."
4,"Some standout songs, but skip the others","There are some great and moving songs on this CD. I love the catchy ragtime numbers like the title song. The three song sequence of ""Your Daddy's Son,"" ""The Courtship,"" and ""New Music"" brings me to tears. Alas! This emotional climax comes far too early in the musical, making much of what follows a letdown. There are plenty of forgettable numbers I program my CD player to skip (especially the corny ones the immigrant sings (e.g., ""Success,"" a knockoff of Miss Saigon's ""The American Dream,"" and ""Gliding"")) -- these songs may work well in the context of the musical, but they don't stand on their own. But when this CD soars, as it does often enough, you'll want to be along for the ride to enjoy the excellent performances. The bonus track, ""The Ragtime Symphonic Suite,"" may be a bit pretentious, and sometimes sounds like outtakes from Copland or ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" but it still is a catchy medley and wisely focuses mostly on the best songs from the musical."
3,PHAT SHOW,IF YOU LIKED LES MISERABLES YOULL LIKE THIS ONE . ITS EVEN BETTER THEN CATS OR TITANIC I HOPE YOU GO SEE IT SOON
3,it's ok......,"i guess the music on this cd is alright, but hardly the best. Some of the songs are good but others aren't. I think that the whole plot in general is just plain boring. The music adds a litte, but not much. If you want a really great BROADWAY Mucial that wikll completely blow you away, go see RENT! RENT is the best ever"
4,Original Toronto cast,"RAGTIME had its world premiere in Toronto in December 1996. The Toronto critics (myself included) were the first to sing the praises of this fine musical.This recording was made by the Toronto cast (most of whom traveled with the show to Broadway in 1998) while the show was still in rehearsal. The producers wanted the album in stores before the opening night. Even at this early stage it is quite polished and professional sounding though if you are familiar with the 2 CD Broadway recording you will note some changes in the lyrics and song line-up.I agree with most of the others, get the complete recording if you can as it will give you a better sense of the whole show. But as a recording of highlights (and to hear the cut song ""The Show Biz"") this is a very worthwhile Cd."
5,Wow,"It seems that everyone is always fawning over Audra McDonald, but the voice that impresses me most is that of Marin Mazzie: it's clear, powerful, and expressive. That said, this is a remarkably intense and complete 2-disc set. The orchestra is flawless, the other performers are amazing as well. This is what a Broadway soundtrack should be: it's got the Broadway sound with elements of jazz and rag thrown in. If you like the musical, this is an impressive cast recording. And if you like this type of musical - big and proud - then this soundtrack is for you."
2,Wonderful Score...but Aweful Recording,"A few songs in this recording were cut as well as several changed lines etc. The other recording which is a double cd is SOOOOO much better! Although the cast alter very little, the performers do so much better on the b-way cast version. Judy Kaye, who isn't featured on the above recording, is featured on the bway cast recording and her wonderful interpretation of Emma Goldman will move anyone who listens! Please get the other version! It is well worth the money!"
5,It's always time for RAGTIME!,"Miraculous! Never has a story (on stage or in any other form) been so heartwarming! Non-stop brilliance is showcased throughout its entire length with glorious melodic power. Sometimes humorous, often tear-jerking, ""Ragtime,"" which was somehow beaten by the ""publicity king"" at the Tony's, deserves to be honored as being the best musical ever made! This show is in a quality class all its own! A+"
1,Uhhh. Were the Best-Original-Score voters on CRACK in 1998?,"I particularly can't see why this show won ANY awards, when the Best Original Score definately deserves in the hands of The Lion King. This show was drab, boring, and I could find better things to do at home like watch a tree outside die, or maybe watch the wallpaper peel.TLKoB 4 Life!"
1,Ruined a perfectly good novel.,"If EL Doctrow were dead, I would assume he'd be rolling in his grave. The music, a pop-happy score written by the same pasty white schmucks responsible for such CRAP as ""Seussical"" and ""Once on this Island"" (THEY'RE NOT BLACK), WON A TONY? And not just one, but four? This is an awful mess of bland and meaningless power ballads. Ahrens and Flaherty should be shot. I hate this show. I hate it. It is awful."
5,Fantastic,"I am currently in this show, up on study of the script and listening to this cd I have come to learn a great deal about the real characters and the fictional characters. I was moved to tears by the emotional intensity of the voices. I love Audra's voice, she really brings Sarah's voice to the show, and Your daddy's son is just a brilliant song period. This show has the power to change lives, I encourage anyone and everyone to see this, or just hear it."
2,PLEASE!! GET THE OTHER VERSION!,The other version of ragtime may be more expensive but you get a Better emma Goldman (JUDY KAYE!) and more dialogue and more songs! It is SOOO much more heartfelt! Please buy the other version!
4,A charming collection of designs,"Most of Elena Thomas cross stitch designs are suited for beninning skill levels, a bay tree topiary is more challenging. All projects have color photos and charts are black and white. The designs range in size, with 3 Assisi charts (background is stitched) that may be made larger by increasing the stitching area. A lavender design is used for a sachet bag and trinket box, and is suited to be used in many projects. Basic skills are explained and a page of suppliers is provided. The designs are simple, attractive, and inspiring for uses in a variety of handcrafted objects. Colors of embroidery cotton are listed in DMC, Anchor and Madeira threads."
5,well made stool,"well made stool, this is a sturdy and well made product, the storage area is very handy for me and im very pleased with ot;;"
4,"wow, cool shoes and fast too","thanks for ""flying"" these shoes to my door. I'm playing better than ever and I think it's the shoes that are just too cool. Feel great, look great."
2,I miss the appeal,"I purchased this SACD based upon the two glowing reviews that preceded me. To each his own, I guess. Instead of finding the charm mentioned by the other two, I found a recording a bit too innovative and pretentious for my taste. Though I enjoy both Jazz and chamber music,I did not enjoy the hybrid musical form presented in this offering. You might feel differently, just make sure that you hear some cuts prior to purchasing."
1,Waste of Money,"This book only touches the important subjects on the surface. This book is not good for someone who seriously wants to learn tomcat. It does not discuss most important parts in detail except for the installation.For me, it was a waste of money and I had to buy a another book called Mastering Tomcat Development, which is a great book for beginners and experienced tomcat users."
5,Great book!,"The Tomcat Kick Start text is a wonderful book when one wants to setup and run a J2EE server. The text goes over Servlets, JSP, Tomcat Administration, database connectivity, etc. Everything is bundled precisely into one nice book. It's a great purchase for anyone running or interested in running Tomcat."
3,Too ambitious; too generic,"Rowh sets out to provide ""detailed descriptions of a range of interesting careers"" and ""expert advice on finding the best jobs in the field."" Unfortunately for his readers, the task ultimately proves all too ambitious. While a great breadth of areas are presented (brokerage, appraising, development, planning, counseling, law, loan processing, building inspection, etc), most are given only the most superficial of treatments. If you're looking for an in-depth guide on careers in real estate, turn instead to the Urban Land Institute's ""The Inside Track to Careers in Real Estate"" by Stan Ross."
5,Perfect as an Equine First Aid Kit,"Serves perfectly as an Equine First Aid Kit.Also can be used as a Home First Aid Kit (stock it yourself).Can be thrown in your car in case of emergency evacuation!Well made and durable. Easy to organize. Doesn't take up a lot of space, but organizes lots of items.Makes a great gift.Buy TWO!!"
1,DISSAPOINTED,IVE HAD THE BOTTLE FOR ONE YEAR AND BARELY USE IT. WAY TOO STRONG. Smells like cheap perfume and gives me a headache.
5,Girlfriends favorite Scent,"Hard to find in stores now, Bought it during xmas time, There are a lot of newer fragrances by gucci which stores are trying to push. My girlfriend is addicted to this scent and couldn't find it. Made a great gift. It is sweet smell, which a hint of rose. Great Purchase."
5,smells delicious,"I didn't buy the perfume from here, but I recieved it as a gift and fell in love w/ it.At first the scent might seem a little strong but after a little bit it smells REALLY GOOD.I've gotten many compliments on the smell and I can't stop sniffing my wrist every now and then.The only thing I don't really like is the smell seems to leave quickly. Or maybe I'm smelling it too much.:)definitely recommend"
4,Fresh Scent,"I love this fragrance! And the bottle is simply pretty. However, the scent doesn't last that long."
5,needle in a haystack,"I bought this for my mom because she absolutely loves this fragrance. This product has been discontinued & so it was hard for us to find it at retailers. Even at the Perfumania we use to buy it from. Good thing I found it here & for a reasonable price! Will be buying more for sure. This perfume is a young, fresh, sweet & playful kind of smell. Hopefully that helps."
4,This thing rocks!,This brush cleaned my son's kiddie pool and my patio furnature in 30 minutes-- combined. It's great.
3,The wisdom of the past can guide our footsteps in the future,"Slow down Mr. Kelly, nobody is talking about bringing back archaic practices, but rather a book that can shed light on a number of subjects confronting this Nation. I for one am intrigued when anyone balks at what a book may contain, this heightens my curiosity and interest in reading this book. What could the ACLU be wanting to supress? isn't this operating contrary to their very own charter? I want to know what the founding fathers intended and thought, what worked, and what didn't, we have the benefit of retrospect. In my opinion all sides of an issue need to be exposed to those with enough brains to study them, and make their own decisions... so I am for bringing this book by Benjamin Morris to publication, AND exploration"
2,Not the disco I remember!,"I grew up in the 70's and love the music. That is why I bought this CD for my kids. The first comment I have is that I have never even heard of 3 of the songs: ""Oops Up Side Your Head"", ""Best Disco in Town"" and I.O.U. I thought they would come back to me when I heard them, but they didn't! The second comment I have is that I was disappointed that Y.M.C.A was not sung by the original singers and neither was Brand New Key. The people who did sing them did not do them well. On a positive note, I enjoyed Disco Duck by Rick Dees and That's the Way I Like it by KC & the Sunshine Band. I'm still not sure what KC meant by that, though, so maybe it's not the greatest for kids?? I think for the money this CD cost, maybe just an adult CD of disco music would have been just fine."
4,Disco Plus,"This has many of the best disco songs including Car Wash, That's The Way I Like It, Le Freak, & Celebration. My friend's favorite-Disco Duck is also on there. The sound is clear and disc is in very good condition. Great seller. Karen"
5,Great Movie to get kids interested in Opera,"LOVE THIS MOVIE, great animation and wonderful singing! My kids love it and has peeked their interest in the world of Opera."
1,Total Incompetence,"In all my fifty five years I have never dealt with such an incompetent company. We have had 5 Tracfones and trying to get them to work is difficult, which is putting it mildly. No-one at their company understands English and even speaking very slowly doesn't work, so much so that you go round and round in a continual loop. We needed a new sim card last year, three times they said they'd sent it and three times it never arrived. Bought a new phone and need a sim card but this time they tell me my cousin's address doesn't exist - funny she's been there a while and we've visited her. (We live in England but spend many weeks in the States each year). They won't send cards to England, fair enough, but why can't they deliver them to addresses in the States, or at least not lie and say they have when they obviously haven't. Avoid this company like the plague."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I was excited to get this CD but unfortunately the songs are too short- a fact I overlooked as I like to 'get on in' to my classic grooves, and I don't play it much at all."
2,"THESE ARE ALL THE SHORT ""45 RPM"" VERSIONS!!","Why take the time to put together a compilation like this, and then put the short (edited) versions on it? WHAT A WASTE!Furthermore, the selections aren't that good. There was far better (and much funkier!) disco music made during this era.Not for me at all."
3,Disappointed,"Having very carefully chosen this CD based on my own memory of the tunes, the music sampler available and, most importantly, comments from other reviewers, it transpires that only 3/20 tracks are more than 4 minutes long. Majority of the tracks are between 3-4 minutes long. Not what I would term as 'Super Rare Disco' at all. Rare Disco is surely the full length 12 inch mixes that would have been played in the clubs, as opposed to radio edits!!! Yes, I realised there were 20 tracks in total on this CD...but not one of the previous reviwers stated all 20 tracks were on just ONE CD, nor the fact that majority of the tracks were radio edits. Shame, as majority of the tracks themselves are very good. Disappointed."
5,"SUPER RARE DISCO, Vol. 1 & 2","One of the best collections of 1970's hustle music. As a former New Yorker, I still own hundreds of hustle 45's and 12-inch dance records from the 70's and wanted to get the same songs on CDs. This collection of 40 hard-to-find disco songs (on Volume 1 & 2) is great. I liked Volume 2 slightly better than Volume 1, but both are excellent. Even the liner notes are incredibly well-written by a New Yorker who really appreciates classic disco music and who lived through the NY dance club scene in the 70's."
5,Buy It. Just Buy It.,"This is an incredible meld of classical and metal music. I doubt that anyone else could do this as well as Wolf Hoffmann, who has nourished his love of classical music throughout his career as guitarist for the metal band Accept.If you love classical music, treat yourself to a wrenching, gripping new take on it. If you love metal music, treat yourself to the classics in a way you've never heard before; a way that will win you over to classical music at last.I give copies of this CD as presents to people I love a lot."
1,Edgar Allen NO,"Actually ZERO stars.This was one of the most dreadfull movies I have ever seen. I used a free rental credit for this and I still paid too much. This ""movie"" was undoubtedly shot by a group of people over a booze & drug weekend. The acting was just that - acting. Completely unbelievable characters & plot (not that there was much of one). You cannot get lost in this movie because the movie itself is lost. Aside from these problems, the sound is so uneven. You must have your remote at the ready when watching this. At times there is low sound with near whispers. Next (for effect, I assume) the sound blasts in an attempt to scare. The only thing scary about this movie is the screenwriter's complete lack of understanding (or respect) of Edgar Allen Poe's, ""The Raven.""Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe"
3,Thought there would be more...,"Having seen Brackett's website, I bought this book thinking it was going to have floor plans (which is what I really wanted) for actual traditional Japanese style houses as well as more pictures and information detailing his Traditional, Westernized and Hybrid Japanese house designs, but the book was mostly just about building a guesthouse and only has one floor plan for the said guesthouse.The information about the technical stuff (heating, etc), construction process and building materials was very good though."
4,For those who are tired of electronica and clubbing,"For those who are tired of electronica and clubbing, why don't you listen to some old nice tunes?Cores do Brasil series is the great introductory compilation of Brasilian music.Lots of sweet melodies, compiled by British. Got to be good and truly worth listening.Make yourself a nice cup of coffee, light up your favorite cigarette, if you smoke, and listen to it.You will be in heaven for the next 60 minutes, I'm sure."
3,Ok product,"Received quickly however not too sure how well it works. I have not noticed much, if any, of a difference."
2,Not for everyone,"This dvd is for people who want to see what a German nudist beach is like, drinking at the Octoberfest and where to find your backpack should you drink too much and loose it. We looked at a mud field where Hitler's house once was and found out about recycling in the country and ended up watching some rock climbing. Not what I had in mind exactly."
1,Uninteresting,"This DVD must be the worst travel DVD I've ever watched. Justine Shapiro, if you don't want to go to regular/popular tourist places, fine! But at least go somewhere interesting and worth travelling half the globe; other than seeing wrinkled buttocks on nudist beach located at the very North of Germany or abandoned Nazi place where the amateur skateboarders hang out, or where to experience sleeping on the hay. Really??!!On the case cover it has Hamburg as one of destination points (which was one of the reasons why I wanted to watch it). But she did not even go to Hamburg!!! So i would say that is deceiving. Oh by the way, if i want to know how the Germans are doing with energy saving or environmental efforts, I would not watch travel DVD to start with!My only positive review: If you live in Germany, you might want to watch it when you run out of place to go to."
4,Not your regular travel DVD,"The Lonely Planet travel series is different from many of the other travel series such as Rick Steves, Samantha Brown and so on. Each episode is a little quirky. It seeks to express a feeling more than landmarks. Most of the Germany DVD is hosted by Justine Shapiro, one of the best of all the travel series hosts. She brings alive the sights she sees with her own energy and sensitivity. Always worthwhile seeing. As an example of quirk, she visits the oldest nudist beach in Germany. If I want to see landmarks and the standard travel DVDs I purchase Rick Steves and Samantha Brown. When I want something a little different, I purchase Lonely Planet's Globe Trekker series. Enjoy!"
4,Attractive calendar,"This lovely birthday perpetual calendar has nice images and good reproduction. The calendar is made to hang up: I wish that the hanging device was of a better design. The spaces to write names beside each date are adequate, I wish that there was more vertical space for dates. That being said, the calendar is easy to use and nice looking."
3,Birthday Calendar,"Although the calendar was designated for birthdays as described, the picture did not give an adequate understanding of what the calendar looked like, how big it was, or where the binding was. There was no description either. The end result was my surprise at how large it was, and that it was a wall hanging calendar. Still, does the job."
1,ungly and no good,"I really did not like this item. The colors are ugly and it is not really a book, it is more like a calender. I do not recommend it at all."
5,QB VII,"This is an excellent Mimi Series. I loaned my old copy out and never got it back so I am so glad that I could order another one. A very, very good movie and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys Jewish history."
5,One of the best TV movies ever made!,"With some differences from the plot of Leon Uris's book, this movie nevertheless captured the essence of the book. The acting was superb! The courtroom scene between Anthony Quayle and Anthony Hopkins (who also deserved an Emmy) was so incredible that the movie is worth viewing just to see these two acting icons demonstrate their skills. I only wish that this movie were priced in a range that the average person could buy it. I also have not seen it for rent anywhere."
2,Has not aged well,"I had high hopes for this after having read the other reviews, but this is very cheesy. I realize it was an early mini-series, but wow. Perhaps if I had seen it when it first came on I would feel differently, but as it stands I can't recommend this at all."
5,Great Story,"A somewhat dated and stilted movie, but well worth the time. Gazzara is very good; Hopkins not so much. Love to see this re-made. It was one of - if not the - first ""mini-series"", and the blank screens every few minutes (obvioulsly for commercial breaks) are a bit annoying."
5,VERY ENJOYABLE!,"A super way to travel from my couch!! I was very pleased with the entire trip and the commentary on this video. Learned some interesting facts, and had fun doing it! I will play this video anytime I feel the need to take a great trip!!"
2,For litle people,"I wanted some magnification to read small print on my TV when surfing the net. These Binocs are small form for kids and require some alignment when looking thru them. You can't just pick them up, you have to do a little moving around to find objects. I need something like a magnifying glass for short distances of 10 to 15 feet. They would probably entertain a child for hours."
4,wonderful,I ordered the Rhubarb strawberry pie filling and it was great and very well packed no damage even though it was glass containers
3,I'll Be Waiting - Full Intention presents Shena,"UK CD Single Track Listing for -""I'LL BE WAITING"" - FULL INTENTION presents SHENA1) Radio Edit2) Gray & Pearn Club Mix3) The Lux Sunset Editalso includes the video.2001"
3,Jazzy Neo-Nor Has Its Moments,"Here's another film that one might label a neo-noir. It's film noir in story, attitude and camera-work but it's color and it's a 1992 film, not one from the late 1940s or early '50s.The story is set in England and is a good mixture of suspense, action and romance. It's nicely filmed with a lot of night shots featuring some cool neon signs of London streets and pubs. Looks-wise, this film reminded me a lot of ""Stormy Monday.""There is some good jazz in here, too. The action picks up much more in the second half of the film, capped off by a unique huge transformer-like vehicle chasing Michael Caine. The ending was a bit weak and hokey but overall, the film was entertaining and good stuff if you're a noir buff.At the cheap price, don't look for a sharp DVD transfer, or one with extras. You get what you pay for."
3,FUN MOVIE,I like most of the things in this movie. Wish they got M.Caine to lose some weight before the film started. It has a unique plot. The chemistry is all fine. Russell Mulcahy is a good action film director given the correct resources. Even better is the familiar Brit cast. I doubt they will ever make fun films like this again.
4,The Amazing Book of Emily Windsnap,"This book is one of the unique book about the tales of the under water creatures like mermaids, mermans, sharks, dolphins etc. The book explains alot abot how an ordinary girl figures out her FANTASTIC secret! She is a mermaid. I've only read about one book written about Liz Kessler, and I say it is the most amazing thing I've read about the mermaids and their tail (tale). But in other words this book was out standing, no doubt about it! And I can't wait to read the next book of Emily Windsnap. The book has shown be that you discover new things while you are living. That is just like Emily. And hopefully I discover a great secret about me and not like I discover my brother messing up my room everyday."
1,Very poorly written book,"As a teacher, I read several hundred children's and young adult books every year. This book was a huge disappointment. Poorly written with ridiculous situations that don't make sense (reading a paper book under the water? Not being able to scale an underwater wall? Has the author not heard of being able to SWIM over it?) and flat characters. There are some wonderful children's books out there about magical creatures. This is not one of them. :(Actually, I should have known the book was bad. On the back cover, the only reviews are for the ARTWORK! The writing isn't even mentioned."
4,Perfectly Timed,"*First things first, anyone who loves Harry Potter and thinks this book will be like it, is wrong. I found it completely different. (I myself don't care for HP). It was written differently and was about a totally different fantasy.*I read this book with total fascination. I felt like I was going through the hardships with Emily Windsnap. The author could not have described the underwater terrain more clearly and I could really picture what was going on in my head. The feelings characters felt and expressions they made came naturallly to me when I read the descriptions. The author timed all of the dillemas, miracles, sad scenes, and action scenes just right. Even the feeling of suspense was there when you needed it! The tale is dramatic and encasing, I never doubted that what I was reading could actually happen. A perfectly timed, real, fun novel I hope you pick up."
2,Under the Sea! and under rated,"I liked this book , but i did get bored at some parts, i'll admit. The Tail of Emily Winsnap is a good read but don't get ur hopes up 4 an ah-mazing book. The story is worn and tiresome. It was worth the buy but if u dont have 2, don't bother reading it."
4,Great Book!,I bought this kindle version for my nine year old daughter's book report. She loved it. It kept her attention and made it a easy book report project.
4,lynne,"Was an entertaining story. Did not know what to expect. More for younger readers, but I would read more if the price was right. Good story for mother and daughter."
4,"Hey, its chalk.",Good stuff. A little hard to see on some materials or in bright sunlight; I mix 50/50 with blue for optimal visibility and unique color.
5,Unique Chalk,"When we go on job sites, this is the chalk we use. No one else uses it, so it is easy to determine which chalk lines are ours. It also does not stain the concrete (like red chalk can), so it is safe for stained concrete flooring. It is also easy to pour, and costs no more than other colors."
3,I'm confused--was I supposed to buy a separate handle?,"I bought this because the last two garden forks I bought broke as soon as I started using them to weed, and this one looked unbreakable. What I didn't realize is that it isn't really usable without a handle to cover the end of the handle (hurts my hand with any real pressure). I'm going to look and see if I need to buy something else. I'm still giving this three stars, because it's a good start, but I wish it was clearer how this was supposed to work."
5,awesome cd player,"My gosh, so happy the cd player doesn't skip, you wouldn't expect this from a new product but as the last couple were complete junk and after all the time installing and then removing, this is a major issue with marine head units which almost caused me to skip the cd feature all together. 3rd times the charm, i should have picked Pyle in the first place. Marine environments are rough on equipment and moister has no effect on the player....smooth play constantly!!!"
3,waterproof for the topless truck,"Works well, but with 25W per channel a little weak in volume output. But for the price a good deal."
3,HALF GREAT AND HALF NOT SO HOT,"A FEW OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT, BUT I WAS TURNED OFF WITH SO MANY RAP TYPE SOUNDS THAT SOUND THE SAME, OVER AND OVER. THE WORST WAS THE HEAVY BREATHING AND MOANING SONG--WOULDN'T HE RATHER HEAR YOU? WE DON'T NEED THREE OF US. THE MOANING IS A DISTRACTION FROM THE MUSIC--HOW DO YOU DANCE TO MOANING?"
5,very xantharific!,"I love xanth! It is a world i would love to live in. I got hooked on these books at a very young age and would recommend them to all who love to read! The books just keep getting better as you go along through the series. My favorite parts are when xanthians travel to mundania.. it is always a hoot! Buy the series, you wont be disappointed!"
4,A Book for Boys - And others.,"Heaven Cent was my favorite Xanth novel when I read it some twenty plus years ago. It is unabashedly an adventure for boys, and it delivers well. When a 9 year old shape-shifter sets out on a quest to find a lost magician, and see the world, he encounters endless adventure, significant dangers, dreadful puns, and manages to fall in love with a beautiful girl who is many years older. Personally, his love for this girl, who is also a naga (half-human/half-snake who can take either form) was my favorite part of the book. People under-estimate a young person's ability to feel love, but not here.With the endless adventure, the magnificent artistry of the land of Xanth, and the emotional depth of this novel, it is an adventure for everyone. But any young man or boy could easily see themselves as the young main character."
3,It was okay,"I like Piers Anthony, I like his writing style, I like the Xanth series, I just realy don't like Dolph. I realy just didn't find the book particurly interesting."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read in my life.,"Stupid puns. Superficial, boring characters. Rampant sexism. Memorably dreadful."
5,From Sea to Shining Sea,This CD has about 5 tracks on it that really stand out. Songs that you typically don't find but of great quality.Summon the Heroes the Theme from JFK were my personal favorites. It also has all the traditional favorites for the Fourth of July celebrations.
5,Must Have,"For those of you who love music that soothes, transports, and just makes you feel good, this disc is a blend that you shouldn't miss. Bill Douglas is versatile and satisfying as a composer, as his long career attests to, and Richard Stoltzman's clarinet playing made a clarinet convert out of this no-woodwinds fan! Great stuff."
4,Great late night listening ................,"I am amazed that all the criticism of this album is largely because this is not new material. So what!This is a well crafted album of songs that are interpreted in Lyle's unique style.Enjoy the album for what it is and not what it isn't. The material is wonderful. This is a mellow jazz album that is full of surprises.Grab yourself a good scotch, turn down the lights and turn up the music."
4,Moritat repays your CD investment,"This is a compilation of Lyle's music from movie soundtracks. Some songs worked well in the movie, but may not set your toe to tapping as part of this collection. That's OK. One song on here will make up for any problems you may have with vocals here or arrangements there. Lyle's version of 'Moritat' (From Weil's Threepenny Opera, better known as 'Mac the Knife' ) is knock-you-down good. This songs been recorded too often as a happy, swingin' fingerpoppin' little number, ala Bobby Darrin. Nicht vahr, mein freund. It's really grim as grim can be, and Lyle gives you a peek at that side of it. Great arrangement.His duet with Keb Mo' on Shine is another high point, and the closing number 'I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)' is a personal favorite. But the song that makes me hit 'replay' is Moritat. It's that good. I've said it before I'll say it again, Julia Roberts screwed up."
2,average at best,Lyle Lovett has a fairly decent tone but this set doesn't add anything to His range.it seems like a safe outlet at releasing a Album.covering Movie songs is a risky choice because unless you have the proper outlook it can be complicated&seem like a poor lounge version which happens to be the case with much of the material here.
1,More Corporate Country,"Lyle Lovett is just the latest corporately manufactured top 40 country singer to come down the line. It totally sounds like they overdubbed his voice in the studio and used background singers to bolster his thin, quavering voice. Most of the backing tracks were also obviously programmed on a cheap synthesizer, Casio mayber? 3-minute ditties that sound like they were designed with the top-40 in mind, banal subject matter, and a real lack of conviction on lovett's part all add up to an album that will be in the cut-out bin within the month."
2,Disappointing,"As a loyal Lyle fan from many years back I was ecstatic to hear that he had a new album, and when I saw the song list I was even more excited. The excitement ended when I played the CD the first time, and hasn't been rekindled with subsequent replays. For the first time ever I'm hearing Lyle with absolutely no soul - it's like he was walking through the recording sessions, without ever getting really involved with the music. The only track I like is the Toy Story theme with Randy Newman, and that's because Randy comes across so well on it. To me the CD is a huge disappointment - if you find it in a used CD bin at a greatly reduced price, you may want to check it out for yourself. My advice: Save your CD dollars for another time, and maybe even another artist."
2,What was he thinking,I didn't think Lyle Lovett could make a bad album. I have bought all of them as soon as they came out. However this one is a real disappointment. It is not what he does best and he doesn't have the voice to make this stinker work. It seems most singers have to try a standards album and most of them don't work-this is one of them. Let's hope that this is Lyle's only attempt.
4,Lyle sings standards (and a little bit of soul),"This disc gathers tunes Lyle has sung in various films from 1992-2002, mainly of the pop standards variety (""Straighten Up And Fly Right,"" ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You,"" and the like). Fans who dig Lovett's love of jazz and non-country formats will appreciate this collection, which only gets twangy on a couple of tunes. Mostly it's a Sinatra-esque ballad collection, although his version of Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"" is a perky number for sure!"
1,TOO KIND,"The last reviewer was too kind. This CD is awful. In fact it plain [stinks]. On some tracks it is hard to even tell that it is Lyle at all, particularly Blue Skies. I like the song Blue Skies, if Lyle was going for a Chet Baker sound, that may explain why it is so bad. Much as I liked Baker as a trumpet player, I could never stand more than a few seconds of his ""singing"".Only the last two tracks come close to his best material, which is to be found on most any of the releases through the ""Joshua Judges Ruth"" release. All of those early releases are solid efforts, since then Lyle has been a mixed bag at best. With this the worst effort of the lot, BY FAR. TOO BAD.Don't waste the money on it. Save it and see him in concert should he come to your area. If that is not an option, go for those earlier releases, if you haven't had the pleasure already."
2,Another disappointment,"Lyle Lovett has always been one of my favorite ""singer-songwriters,"" but I'm starting to wonder whether the label still fits. It's been seven long years since Lyle released an album of original material, and with the exception of 1998's brilliant Step Inside This House, his releases during that time have all been repackaged ""filler."" Lyle's loyal fans deserve better.This album is a collection of songs previously released on movie soundtracks, and while it's nice to have them all together in one place, most of the performances are forgettable. ""Summer Wind"" and ""I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord"" are probably the best of the bunch; the remainder are pleasant but uninspired. I'll wait for the comeback album, and sincerely hope Lyle's writer's block will end soon."
2,What was he thinking,I didn't think Lyle Lovett could make a bad album. I have bought all of them as soon as they came out. However this one is a real disappointment. It is not what he does best and he doesn't have the voice to make this stinker work. Does everyone have to try a standards album?
2,Not Hulless-Poor Flavor,"Bought this as I needed something with no hulls.This had the same amount of hulls as any popcorn I've ever had. And to boot, the flavor was very bland.I pop my corn in a high-temperature cooker and buy only premium quality popcorn.I am very disappointed to say the least."
2,Too Simple,"COSMO is reggae music? This is like...I want to cash in some money off of reggae music type of music. Who books these type of bands anyways? Lets get the real reggae bands like Israel Vibes and Mighty Diamonds back on track. Seen? Cosmo is not bad, he's just not excellent. He falls right in line with the rest of the boring reggae pack. Not much of a standout, in a time when we need a standout. Bring JAH music back somebody!"
2,Well researched but didn't help me,"This book was written in an easy, friendly style and the author had obviously done her homework. I had to laugh at her suggestion that everyone can find a little time every ady for their nails - that wonderful premise of every self-improvement guru.Despite persistant and devoted effort to her suggestions, I was disappointed to find that none of her offerings could help protect my nails against the rigors of real life. I wish other readers better luck."
5,Nice,This is a nice item if you use baby food jars. Unfortunately a lot of baby food now comes in plastic rectangular containers so I don't use it as much as I could.
4,"Cara-Woodbridge, CT","I would have loved this baby food holder if the baby food all came in jars. Times have changed a little. Most baby food comes in square containers so, they don't fit in the holder."
2,Not Original Music,"It's almost ludicrous to see all the praise being heaped on Richard Rogers for his score to Victory at Sea since very little of the score is original music. I remember seeing an interview with Rogers sometime ago when he laughed at the idea that he could possibly have composed so much original music in such a short amount of time. He borrowed most liberally from Richard Wagner, with some of the themes for which he receives so much praise from other reviews at this site being lifted directly, note for note, from some of Wagner's Operas. Rogers main contribution was reshaping previously composed music to fit the various episodes and perhaps composing a few notes to transcend from one theme to another.What's so sad about undeserved praise is that Rogers was a truly great composer, perhaps the greatest ever on Broadway. But this time I think he'd be embarrassed to receive praise if he were in the company of other composers familiar with the classics."
3,Not The Original Music,"This album is fine for individuals who may want to savor their actual days at sea, which is why I went ahead and gave it three stars. But what I really wanted it for was to be THE actual recorded music of the TV series, not a re-recording. While this is a very nice set of recordings, it is probably done with a larger orchestra, and for some reason it is all played a lot slower than the score of the original TV series. I was really hoping for the EXACT recording and this is not it."
3,Victory at Sea - Revisited,"Well, they certainly DO get ""Better than This"" (in response to a previous reviewer). I grew up listening to the original score and soundtrack from the 1952 TV series.This re-arrangement for the movie fall short of the depth, excitement, and vision of R. Roger's original composition.Athough the music on this CD is still wonderful to listen to, it doesn't capture the same feeling for someone like myself who expected to hear the fine nuances in the spectacular music I grew up with nearly 50 years ago.Unfortunately, I don't think the original soundtrack is available on CD, only on the upcoming original TV series to be released on DVD this fall."
3,Disappointing,"I grew up with an LP recording of the Boston Pops playing most of the tracks found on this CD. While this particular recording may be closer to the original, I found the tempos plodding and lacking in energy. The strings sound muddy and weak and at times the general sound reminded me of a good high school orchestra. This recording is just not doing justice to the music. I find it disappointing."
1,Big Disappointment,"Having been a fan of the original ""Victory At Sea"" series on the TV documentary version, and having owned the original LP versions of both Victory At Sea, Volume I and Volume II, as well as the cassette versions, I have to say that this CD version is, at best, mediocre. Somehow in the process of ""remixing"" this CD with Dolby Sound, the quality of the music is much less satisfying than the original versions. I realize that the listening public today wants to hear their music via CD and in stereo format, but the original mono versions of Victory At Sea as released by RCA Victor many years ago had a power and crispness that this version sorely lacks. Even the order of the tracks is different than the original. Bottom line, to me, is that this CD was a ""good try, but no cigar""."
3,FYI,"Original lp was released in 1956; performance by members of the NBC symphony orchestra. Vol.2 of V at S was released in 1959 and Vol.3 in the early1960's and performance is by the RCA symphony orchestra. Note: ArturoToscanini was conductor of the NBC symphony from 1937 until 1954. Under his direction, NBC was considered to be one of the finestsymphony orchestras in the world. When Maestro Toscanini died in 1957, theorchestra disbanded 5 years later."
5,Wonderful and soooooo relevant today,"A WONDERFUL commentary on the book of Jude (second to the last book in the Bible). Coder offers some great insights into what Christians should be on the watch for in the last days. I have the 1958 version of this book (green cover), but I presume it has the same text."
4,Worth it for unreleased footage,"Zany collection of concert footage, interviews, music videos and film shorts and, I don't know what the hell that hidden bonus thing was, but it was disturbing. A must have for Lisa Carver fans and an interesting curiosity to have for fans of the 80's and 90's underground scene."
2,waste of money,"Most of their performances just involve miming sex and violence or just writhing around and/or wailing incoherently, which I guess is basically what I expected, but I expected the concepts to be a lot more thought out. It's weird but it isn't funny or clever. Frankly Courtney Love's antics on Celebrities Uncensored and her various other tv appearances have been more entertaining and creative than this. The recent interview clips with Lisa were vaguely enlightening but made me think of that Everclear song ""...they all become volvo driving soccer moms""."
3,Another Hitman game that is about average...,"Another Hitman game that is about average... Hitman Contracts is fun to play,though seems a bit outdated compared to other Hitman games (Except the originalHitman and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. Those two games are timeless classics in mybook).I don't have that much to add to the other reviews, suffice to say thatthis game is somewhat short, at least for me but as always, fun and challenging.I can play it multiple times and have fun though other Hitman games (such as theones that came after this one) seem to offer more replay value, better graphics,sound and more fun in general as well as maybe more weapons options and ways tocomplete a mission."
5,Hitman or Mass Murderer,"I am glad I rented this game. I loved the 2nd one and this follows in the the same path, but is shorter in the overall package. I wonder when #4 will come out. I guess in short if you liked the second Hitman, then play the third. The controls are a little bit different, but I think you will like it."
3,An average game at most,"I was really excited win Hitman:contracts came out but when i played it the results of the game were dissapionting.Through almost the entire game all you do is play levels from previos Hitman games,and agent 47 never walks he glides across the floor.Eidos always prided itself on how fluid the walking motion was so what happened to that fluid walking motion?The people at Eidos and lo interactive thought that blood and gore and the very sick tone of the game was what people wanted but most just want a good game but Eidos only gave the people an average one"
3,what i think of hitman contracts,"I dont think this is one of their ""good"" games.the graphics is really bad and its hard to see the words on the screen.it takes a while to seat there and read before you know your mission.The keys changed form the second game so you had to learn all over again.the missions are kind of boring in a way.I which i did not buy this game"
2,Hitman misses.......,"I loved Hitman 2 but I was a bit dissapointed in Hitman Contracts for all the same reasons most of the people here said.... same missions repeated, no new improvments. The music and story line were way better in Hitman 2. Other then that the graphics are a little more tweeked and the AI is a little better this time around, it's just a rehash of the previous Hitman games and deffinetly not as fun to play as the others were. I'd like to see EIDOS take a risk and do something different with the next Hitman."
2,Disappoints,"I found CONTRACTS a let down after playing Hitman 2. Hitman 2 is better in every catagory. The violence depicted in CONTRACTS is over the top even for an assassin game, the scenes and locations are cluttered, and the picture is clouded and blurry like an episode of Moonlighting. Rent it or better yet borrow it before you buy it."
3,its an ok movie,"well, first of all, ignore the first reviewer. obviously that guy gets entirely to deep into his movies. that being said, i thought this movie was ok, i mean ive seen better but ive also seen far worse. The reason i saw it was because jason behr was in it, and he freakin gorgeous! If youre just looking to watch something a little entertaining, go for it. This is not a movie, however, for those of you who need to constantly overthink everything in the film, lol, its just pure cheesy entertainment really. i give it 3 stars because as ive said, ive seen better but also seen far worse. want to see a really good werewolf movie? check out The Howling. a little old school but still pretty good."
4,Don't knock it till you try it,"I know with the Twilight thing, and vampires being the 'sexy' ones, and werewolves as being kind of dirty and not sexy. I didn't watch it for that reason. I love horror, I love gore. and though this movie is not like Underworld, it has it's charm. I read a lot of the reviews on this movie, and honestly I had my doubts on buying it, but I'm glad I did. It was interesting, the acting was pretty good, the story line was decent. It wasn't perfect, but very enteraining as least for me. I always try to watch something for myself, because the general opinion is not always my opinion."
1,Skinhobblers,"It's a great idea, but it just doesn't follow through. Very little is explained about the skinwalkers origins or the prophecy of the boy. Jason Behr's pumped up muscles are really the only redeeming features. And that's not a good enough reason to rent it."
4,"Skinwalkers, native american shape-shifters...","I bought this movie because the title and description. I did't know what exactly I'd find into that. Despite there are some errors about production, I think this is a non-boring movie and it has good scenes, good special effects and good performance and it's a good story. In general, I liked it."
1,For the love of God don't buy this movie!,"I bought this movie on impulse, expecting a decent sci-fi/horror flick. What I got was one of the worst films I've watched in a long time. Not since Blair Witch 2 has a movie numbed my mind the way this one did. If you feel the need to spend 18 bucks on a movie, buy Super Bad. You'll feel better about yourself and at least get some laughs."
1,skinwalkers,this movie was not to my likeing the makeup was not to my likeing also i wish i good of ben better
2,Maybe Ok for Werewolf Fanatics,"Basically it's a run of the mill werewolf flick that keeps a steady pace, has some ok action sequences and a twist at the end that saves it from being awful. But on the whole I wasn't really impressed.Maybe good for werewolf junkies who need their next fix, but not for me.Skip it and watch Dog Soldiers, Ginger Snaps or even Cursed"
4,"Rhona Mitra - Yes, you've seen her before","I bought this movie for one reason: Rhona Mitra. She's going to replace Kate in the next Underworld movie and I wanted to see this movie despite the mixed reviews. The movie is your basic good werewolves vs. bad werewolves with a kid who gets this special power to cure werewolves on his 13th birthday -- kind of like ""the cure"" in X-Men III. As a solid ""B"" movie, I didn't expect much and therefore I wasn't disappointed. This movie was pretty much just what I expected. BTW: Check out Rhona in Doomsday -- That was way better then this movie."
