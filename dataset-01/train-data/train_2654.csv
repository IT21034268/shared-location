1,Something went wrong...,"I should of listen to the other reviewers, but I have a Troy-Bilt lawn mower and I just love it. This baby, on the other hand, lasted 5 minutes before going up. Go figure. Started making this awful noise and vibrating like crazy. My ears could not take the noise and it was vibrating to the point where I could not hold it. It's going back for a refund."
4,Powerful,This is great for picking up leaves and other small yard debris. The only bad thing is the bag is rather small and if you are doing a lot of leaves it becomes a pain to have to keep emptying it.
3,"Decent product, doesn't live upto expectations","I was expecting more from this then I got with my last $49 blower, but I'd almost say it's not even as good. This unit seems to suffer from vibration and extra weight in comparison. As many have said almost all brands provide a mulch bag that is too small. Also, I thought the blower function wasn't as efficient as the cheaper brand due to the large opening, it should include something to funnel the air more direct...which is more useful on driveways."
2,a hassle to use,"going from vac to blower requires changing funnels. NOT easy poor design, bag also a hassle on shoulder, power cord in the way"
1,Works great until it breaks,"I used this twice. It worked great. I loved it... until it broke. All of a sudden one of the impeller blades broke off, causing the machine to make a lot more noise and vibrate. Of course, the impeller is made of plastic instead of metal like it should be."
2,Bag tore after only 1 season Expensive to replace!,I used this blower/vac for 1 season and it worked OK. It seemed to have adequate power although it was very loud...however the bag tore by the neck (flimsily built) and when i tried to replace it I found it costs more than half of what i paid for the whole blower itself! No thanks...as I don't have any confidence the replacement will last any longer. I'll look for another model and pass on Troy Bilt in the future.
3,Easy to use & inexpensive,"I purchased this product because I needed something to blow leaves & debris off the patio. I wanted something lightweight. And I didn't have a lot of money to spend on the product or shipping. This fit all my needs. I don't think I've ever used the vacuum, so I can't comment on that. But it blows leaves and all that off the patio. It's been durable. But for me personally, with the noise and vibration, I'd rather just sweep."
1,Up in smoke,"This seemed like a fantastic item but when I received it, it began sparking and when I turned it off it smoked and smoked. I tried to start it up repeatedly with the same outcome. Pretty disappointed with this purchase and returned for a refund.Instead of refunding, they sent me another which after a few weeks burned up as well. Will be returning for a refund."
1,DISAPPOINTING AT BEST,"THE FIRST TROY BUILT BLOWER/VACUUM I BOUGHT HAD AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM IN THE SWITCH THAT WOULD GIVE ME A MILD SHOCK WHEN TURNING THE UNIT ON. AFTER THE FOURTH OR FIFTH USE, THE UNIT BEGAN SMOKING. I HAD PURCHASED THE UNIT IN DECEMBER, AND IT WAS NOW MAY. I CONTACTED AMAZON AND WITHOUT ANY HASSEL THEY AGREED TO REPLACE IT. WHEN MY SECOND ONE ARRIVED, I OPEN THE BOX TO TEST THE MOTOR/SWITCH TO SEE IF I'D GET SHOCKED. THE SHOCK CAME WHEN AFTER 20 SECONDS, THE IMPELLER CAME LOOSE OR WAS BROKEN. I PUT THE MOTOR BACK IN THE BACK AND IMMEDIATELY RETURNED IT. AMAZON IS REFUNDING MY ORIGINAL PURCHASE. I'VE SINCE BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND.Troy-Bilt Mulchinator 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #TB125QS"
1,Broke within an hour,"After 2 1/3 bag fulls(not actually full) this thing started shaking so I switched it to blowing real quick it was worse so I shut it off. There was no mulch where I was working, just leaves. When my husband took it apart he found 3 fins had broke off inside causing it to be off balance & unusable. The broke off pieces were in the bag but nothing else that would have broken them. I wished I would have gone with the gas one as it was more power & more metal inside. Yeah, warranty will fix this but I will still have to use it, wish I could send it back for a refund."
1,Motor Burned Up,After several uses the motor started smoking and slowed down. I'm sure it would have burned up if I continued. I use a 20' 16 guage extension cord.The closest service avaliable is 40 miles away so I'll discard it a buy another brand. I live in the SF bay Area.
1,Stay Away from this Model!,"After reading the positive and negative reviews on this item, I reluctantly bought this model since it had the features I needed (blow & vac). First of all, the bag zipper split after a few uses. The new bag costs half of what the entire model cost!!! Then the motor smoked. The unit was still on warranty and I took it in for warranty work. The repairman stated that he has had the same problem with like-models and the manufacturer won't cover the repair. It cost me big bucks for something that should have been covered under warranty. The repairman stated I might have persurvered, but it would have taken time and cost more money. He didn't want to hassle with the manufacturer. My recommewndation: Buy another brand and save you grief."
4,Highly recommended,When my B&D; BV2500 died I wanted to try another brand. I've been more than satisfied.Pros: Fairly light (to me) and the shoulder strap makes it even easier to handle; excellent vacuum (I vacuum and bag all my clippings along with leaves); really like not having to switch tubes between the blower and vac; nice placement of the vac bag (the B&D; was very awkward to use); adequate blower power for my purposes.Con: Some people may want a little more power from the blower.
3,Does what is says and does a fair job of it,"This is a replacement for the same item only rebranded. My other one lasted for several years.This little guy works best on leaves. You can use the low setting to blow the leaves into a pile then the high vacuum setting to suck them into the bag.The machine is light weight and the shoulder strap helps reduce fatigue on your arms.I only have one complaint. The bag is not dense enough. If you have a lot of fine dirt and dust when using the vacuum, then you will be covered with dust from head to toe. Otherwise, it works fairly well."
5,A World of Difference,"I've always HATED stopping to switch out the tubes for mulching leaves or blowing leaves. Now I no longer have to. I've read all the reviews about burnt out motors etc in this product and for me, that's just not the case. I make regular use of the ""Mulchinator"" (funny name) around the lawn and garden of my home twice a week or so till the leaves stop falling and I've experienced ZERO problems. The price was right, it's easy to use and no tubes to change. I'd buy it again. LD Staten Island, NY"
4,"A lot of great, rare monologues","I actually don't own this book, but I was looking through it in the book store and initially noticed all of the great playwrights with work in the book. This is probably one of the best books I have found for age appropriate monologues for teens. They're not your usual, melodramatic ""I'm a teen drug addict"" monologues. They come from great plays and each monologue contains a brief synopsis. I would definitely recommend this book if you're looking for monologues from college that are rarely seen but still great pieces."
2,Good idea but horrible quality,"Imagine my disappointment when my little boy brought me his tree frog on Christmas morning saying ""help, help"" because the frog's leg had broken off. We bought several of these sets, and immediately parts started falling off the minute we took them out of the box. I felt really sorry for my little guy, having this happen on Christmas morning! I felt so bad for him because he loves animals and had been so excited when he first unwrapped these toys.I'd like to give it only one star, but the idea behind the toys really was good. Also I was happy to see animals made out of hard plastic, which kids don't want to chew on like they do the rubber ones. Other than that, though, these toys are terrible. Don't buy them unless you enjoy gluing things together and keeping them in a curio cabinet."
1,Shop around first...,"While the idea behind these products from Wild Republic is a good one, unfortunately the construction and quality are extremely poor. We'd had these items for less than a few hours before arms and limbs began breaking off. If you can find them, Animal Planet makes a series of similar playsets that are of much higher quality and that our son enjoys more. Otherwise, better to do without entirely than waste money on these cheap, flimsy toys."
2,Something seems different about this....,"I've just read five books in the series. I love the author's style of writing, love the characters and can even solve the mysteries. :)However...the writing in this book doesn't flow as well compared to the previous books. I'm glad I read some of the reviews regarding violence. I'm not into gory descriptions that's why I liked the other books."
2,Pedestrian story,"I have enjoyed several of Simon Brett's ""Mrs. Pargeter"" and ""Charles Paris"" books, so I thought I'd give a book from this other series a try. I found it slow and repetitive. The amateur detectives were one-note characters (different notes) that I had a hard time caring about. I felt as if I was reading a weak episode of a mediocre TV series.I was annoyed by Brett's fixation with what women wear as proof of their mental state, philosophy of life, and social class.Maybe Brett couldn't win with this one, though: One subconsciously compares any book about the English horse-trainer business with Dick Francis, and Brett doesn't have the same storytelling skills."
4,Awesome,"I'm not much of a vanilla guy -- I hate it, in fact, but I can tolerate this vanilla taste. This protein mixes amazing, has top notch ingredients, no artificial sweeteners, no chemicals.... this is truly a great formula, at a great price. I'm pissed I didn't find out about this product when it first came out! I've been using Jay Robb protein, which is almost double the cost. This is probably going to be my new go-to protein.I highly recommend this for anyone who's currently using Whey protein. Change it up, get natural.**Update 3/5/12** - Went to go re-order this product, and I see that the price increased since my last order. Still a good value, but not as amazing as it once was."
2,taste not good,i've had tried many different protein powders but this is the worse one out of all. it taste blend with 1 scoop and i can taste the artificial flavor quite a bit.
5,Love it,I like this protein powder because it doesn't use an artificial sweetner. They use stevia which is so much better for you.
5,whey,"Bought as a Christmas request. Arrived quickly, well packaged. This brand is recommended by receiver as the only good tasting choice of whey."
2,Lots of pros & cons,"I bought this on a recommendation for Jamie Eason's LiveFit Trainer and I will not be re-ordering. It's rather low cal. for the amount of protein (87 cals. for 16g) but I didn't find the taste to be as great as other reviewers stated. I used this in my oatmeal and it really over sweetened it for me and when mixed with cold water for post-workout, well I managed to get it down.Great for clean eaters and those looking for low calorie protein but not great on the pallet in my opinion. I'm sticking with my ON Gold Standard whey protein powders."
4,blast from the past,"this was a blast from past really popular in the 1990s. Still sounds good still rocking it, bought it on accident because didn't realize that already had it in my library. Not their fault though. Love the album"
2,Barking Dog,"Very cute dogs, but a couple of problems... the little dog pulls off of the big dog very easily. They rarely stay attached when my 15-month old pulls them around. Of course, we had to add on a longer string for pulling them around. There was no way our toddler could bend over and successfully pull a dog with a 4-inch leash! Plus, the little dog tends to flop over on its side whenever you turn a corner. Of course, then, it ends up pulling off of the big dog... it can't take much resistance. If I had the opportunity to buy a different pull-toy, I probably would..."
2,She got bored with it after 2 days.,"My bunny loved it for a couple days.And then she got bored with it, and doesn't play with it now at all.I have 2 of these balls just hanging around.I would not buy a lot of these.See if your rabbit really does like this toy."
4,GP's Love it,We have two guinea pigs and they both love this toy. Cheap and chearful. Definately worth the price. It lasts quite a long time as well.
5,Our Bunny Loves It...,"Our Bunny Josep Loves His Ball... I Read Another Review And Thought There Was A Bell In It But There Is Not, Buts Its Ok. You Can Always Put On In Yourself. The Shipping Was Also Very Fast!"
3,Rabbit is not interested,"I think this is due to my rabbit's personality, but my rabbit just ignores it. As for the product itself, it is just as pictured and if a rabbit happens to like it, I think it'll be a great ball to chew and play with."
3,Well I is ok,Well my dwarf rabbit loved it but he started eating it so there isn't any left If your rabbit is a chewer I would not remmend this to anyone because it won't last long My lasted a week ish so it is up to you if you want to buy it
5,Keeps my bunny very entertained,"I needed a ball that my bunny could play with and not chew through in a night, and this has worked out really well so far. It's very amusing watching him roll it around on the floor."
2,Rabbit toy chewed too fast!,"Well, bought my rabbit the Woven Grass Play Ball. It is pretty big so I thought for sure it would last her a couple of days. Oops! Lasted only 6 hours before it was totally torn apart. After she tore it up, she ignored it. Seems the fun is in distroying, not much into eating. I ended up throwing out the grass mess. I wouldn't buy this again because, for me, there are less expensive 6-hour toys for rabbits out there...like toilet paper rolls or eatable branches from the yard."
1,My guineas won't touch this,"I got this as a treat for my guineas. Although they normally love grass, they won't touch this thing. It's basically sat in their cage. Waste of money."
3,not bad,It's not a bad product but Chinchillas do not like it at all. they might nimble on it but 99% of the time they would just ignore it. It might be a good product for other pets.
5,Grass Ball,"Both of my rabbits LOVED this chew toy!!!! They don't just chew on it, they also eat the grass, and it doesn't bother their tummies. This is a very good toy for them to chew on since their teeth constantly grow....."
3,He didn't dislike it...exactly,"It's hard shopping for bunnies because they are not a one size fits all kinda pet. Some love certain toys while others, not so much. For Sir Hops-a-lot, he liked picking it up and moving it but didn't really do anything else with it. I was worried that it was collecting dust in his toy basket after several months so I put it in his ""castle"" and that was the end of the ball, all chewed up, just like his mats he goes through so often. So, it didn't go completely unused but at the same time I don't think I'll buy him another one."
5,Bunny Lovesssssssssss,My bunny LOVESSSSSSSSSSSSS this toy as soon as she sees it she runs towards it! I don't know why people keep saying that this comes with a bell inside because it doesn't.
3,No bell inside,"I purchased this based upon another buyer's review. There is no bell in the Peter's Woven Grass Play Ball that I received. I know the bunnies probably do not care, but I purchased it because I enjoy hearing the sound of the bell from the other room when they toss it around. I have two other types of balls with bells, and wanted to add this to the mix. I was disappointed. I wasn't going to return it based upon that alone, though. It is quite messy as they chew on it, but sweeps up well. Just wish it had a bell..."
4,"No bell inside, but a good toy for rabbits.","Like many reviewers here, my Peters Woven Grass Play Ball arrived without a bell inside. One star off for that. Fortunately, I had an extra bell from a cat collar lying around, and just pushed it through the spaces between the weaving - now the ball has a bell.The rabbits showed no interest in this for nearly 3 months. Then one day they ""discovered"" it, and now they have fun tossing it around and chewing on it.If your rabbits don't go for this at first, don't give up. My buns will focus on one toy for awhile and ignore all the others, then suddenly shift their attention to another toy.They also love the Peter's Grass Mat. THAT gets demolished in days. But the Woven Grass Play Ball has lasted for a long time."
5,Fun Toy,"I purchased this play ball for my 6 year old long haired guinea pig, and she tried to tackle it when I placed it in her cage. I started to laugh, because she has never had a toy this big before. I thought it would be great to buy this because the ratings were really good. I do like it when she is happy, and have different toys to give her good opportunity for moving around. At her age it's always wise that they continue to get good exercise, but she like to sit, and eat her timothy hay, and fresh vegetables. I do like the toy, and will continue to watch to see if she like pushing it, or just biting. Maybe even both, but the main point is that she is happy. She's one of my pets that I've had since she was a baby, my other is a cockatiel bird."
3,Okay product,"First I'd like to say that, like a few other reviews I saw, mine did not come with a bell inside. Which was a bit disappointing as I know my guinea pig would have been more interested in it if there was a bell. This might be fun for some small pets, but my piggy just doesn't seem too interested. He chews on it sometimes, and occasionally will push it around the cage with his nose. But for the most part it just sits in the cage untouched. From what some reviewers have said, I'd say its worth a try, but unfortunately it just isn't something my piggy likes too much."
4,My Picky Bun,"i bought this grass ball for my picky picky bun. She rarely plays with any of the toys i made her or any store bought toys such as wood kabobs, but she LOVES to eat. I really wanted to my bun to like this ball, since she can nibble on it, but unfortunately, she did not play with it. She didn't like the grass. I guess she prefers her timothy or oat hay. From the reviews, I'm sure this is a wonderful product. Too bad my picky spoiled bun didn't like it."
4,I love the gazelle,I find the gazelle really easy and a great work out--However the elite computer will not change the mileage back to zero. Don't if this is true for all machines. However for $200 dollars mileage should reset.
1,Quality problem,Quality is somewhat bad. The iron pipe is blocked by iron debris and could not be assemble. I think this company need to improve the quality otherwise it is heavy to send back and forth.
2,not for anyone wanting a serious workout,"The gazelle is very quiet and easy to use, and would be a good piece of equipment for older people or someone with some injuries to knees or other joint problems. But if you want a serious cardio workout this wont deliver without taking a lot of time and using it at the different angels wich become more of a arm workout than anything else. You will not do much for your legs at all."
1,No resistance,Basically the gazelle is a waste of money. There is little to no resistance on the swinging motion so it feels like i am just kicking my legs. I threw this product away after just two weeks because it was so easy i decided to just go on walks instead. Seriously i am overweight and getting off of my ass can get me more winded than this machine. I recommend that you just get a treadmill for an indoor workout.
3,Not as great as it seems,"Easy to put together but this is definitely not a movable item. The Gazelle folds up but is pretty heavy to move about. I work out about three times a week and it is difficult to get a real cardio workout with just the Gazelle so I mix it in with some regular cardio strides etc. The walker is realy easy on the knees which is an added benefit. Great for the price, so far no loose parts but NOT a serious cardio machine."
2,It needs resistance options and i regret buying it.,"It's pretty easy to put together, i had help. The bars do start to squeek not long after using it. The CD it comes with does make you sweat, but i wish it had resistance options, cause like the name ""Free-style"" it just glides along too easily. I do regret purchasing it, but the kids enjoy playing on it, cause it's like a swing. :-)"
1,Disappointing,"In the two months I've had it we've taken it apart and reassembled it twice because of the squeaking. Maximum user weight is supposedly 350lbs. I weigh 156. It affords great range of motion, and is easy on my injured ankle BUT the squeaking is a big turn off."
4,4 Stars,"Easy to assemble, fun to use and quiet. My complaints are that it is not super portable - it is possible to move / store it, just not as easy as you would think from the description. I wish there were some way to increase resistance, but if you use a big stride, you can really get your heart rate going on this. Also, there are some great exercises for muscle toning in your thighs / butt specifically that work much better than weights for me. I often get on it just for fun when I pass, not intending to stay on for longer than a few seconds, and end up doing 12 or 15 minutes because it is actually fun."
4,Assembly process,This product receives four stars because the accompanying dvd did not have assembly instructions on it as indicated in the written instructions which said to watch the video first. I learn best visually so it took a while longer to put together than it would have had I had the dvd. Written instructions were adequate although they contain some assumptions. The product comes with partial assembly. I suggest you clear out a wide space for assembly. There were some spare screws and bolts which is very thoughtful. It would probably go together better with two people but I'm 62 years old and put it together by myself in the middle of my great room while watching an awards on TV. It worked perfectly. Just got it 3 days ago so I haven't used it long enough to write overall function. The dvd is very helpful as a tool for learning how to use the Gazelle.
4,Affordable Workout Machine,"I love this thing! I have no problem working up a sweat with the provided video. Also got it on sale at about $100 off. Far better than buying a gym membership for two. My only complaint is the low QA at the factory. One of the 'feet' is not parallel with the other, off by a few degrees. Otherwise this would have been a 5 star review."
4,Quality of Gazelle Freestyle,"We have the original Gazelle Freestyle introduced a few years back. We purchased this one for our son who recently moved to his own place. The size of the newly purchased Gazelle has been reduced by about 25% and he doesn't feel it is as well made as our original.Aside from all of that, he is enjoying his workouts."
1,DONT BUY IT,"If I could have given this thing no stars I would have. Unstable,doesn't give a good workout, difficult to fold away or move without the feet bashing into you, takes up too much room when set up (the feet need room to do there thing) and just plain sucks. I am 26 and it did not feel safe enough to me to get in a groove (unstable). I certainly would recommend either an electric (pay more for an electric one that you can adjust incline and speed) treadmill or elliptical before this hunk of metal."
1,former supra now an edge,"i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance. well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears(where i bought the junkpiece) says,""Ew,man too bad""!!Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage. Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital!!"
1,Piece of trash,"I used to work for the company that took the phone orders for these. They are complete overpriced, overhyped TRASH. Have fun trying to get your heart rate up on this thing--it ain't gonna happen! You're basically just swinging around with no resistance whatsoever. What a joke! Shame that trash like this makes Tony Little wealthy."
2,"Great at 1st, turns out to be a piece of crap","At 1st it seemed great. It was a fun workout. I didn't lose much weight though which was my goal. It just seemed to tone my legs. at 1st its padded piece came off, but no big deal. Then the entire foot piece broke off where it has been glued. So my dad used bolts to put it on there. Two months later the cable on the side snapped. It is just going to end up falling apart on you."
5,Gazelle Freestyle glider,I have a bad knee and have been told by my doctor that using a treadmill was not a good option for me. The Gazelle allows me to get my heart rate elevated without causing any irritation to my knee. The price was reasonable so it was enough to prompt me to give it a try.I haven't had it for very long but I find that my stamina is building easily. It is true that there is no resistance but I find that I do get a good workout anyway. I watched the workout video and try to incorporate all the different moves into my own workout. I found a couple of the moves a little awkward for me so I just use the ones that I find easy for now. As I build my strength and stamina I plan to try to incorporate the rest of the moves into my workout.With my own music I have found that this workout is the funnest thing to do. Who would have thought that working out could be so fun! I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for options.
3,gazelle freestyle,"The product was shipped in a timely fashion, and received in fine condition. I was somewhat dissapointed with the lack of resistance and ability to adjust resistance in the pedals. The various exercises which can increase strenuousness aren't quite as challenging as I was looking for. However, for a light, fold-up, elliptical model it's very sturdy and economical."
3,Pretty OK Machine... except for some techincal things.,"I purchased the Gazelle Freestyle about 3 weeks ago and I really enjoy it. It is a pretty fun exercise that one can do just watching tv. My mother has really bad joints and she enjoyed the Gazelle and said that it actually makes her joints feel better.However, after using the machine for about 4-5 days, the squeak began (as many other reviewers have mentioned) and it can get very loud. Also, I noticed that the mechanism holding up the cord that sways the pedals back in forth was not moving like it should be and was very tight. Then my mother got on and it suddenly snapped and she nearly fell! It often gets very loose, and if I dont keep tightening it, it will pop again! So just beware of that happening!Other than that, its a fun machine and does give cardio and leg workouts."
5,Finally - Exercise I actually ENJOY!,"We bought our Gazelle in March of 2004 and my husband and I each use it every day - 2 to 3 miles each! It has had it's squeaky problems, but my husband says it just needs some routine maintenance. I have very bad knees and am still able to use this - since it is very low impact. I've lost 60 pounds and my husband has lost 69 pounds! (We are also eating right!)I've never found any exercise that I enjoy - until now! The key is also to use music - Tony Little Fit Trax or Curves Freedom Music are both excellent! The music keeps you going, keeps you motivated and makes it more fun! We love it!"
2,Garbage,"I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money."
1,MFGR is OUT OF BUSINESS - NO WARRANTY or PARTS,"You must reduce the price a great deal. The manufacturer, Fitness Quest is out of business, no longer makes them, no longer makes parts, no longer warrants your machine. You are selling a Pig in a Poke."
1,Not sattisfied,Not satisfied w. item simply because the item was scratched and the computer did not work and because one of the legs was looser than the other one.
1,Huge waste of money!,"I really thought that this machine would get me sweating, but after weeks of trying............nothing. There is no resistance, your just gliding through the air for no reason what so ever. I got absolutely no feeling of accomplishment of finishing a great workout with this machine. After following Tony through the video he provided, I was really suprised when it was over. I was waiting for ""the burn,"" thatburn that lets you know you have actually done something to better your body. This did not do it for me."
2,Booooooring Device,It is great to hung clothes in the bedroom but this machine doesn't help too much with the workout since is not hard and will bore you quickly. The two handles for the hands are really nice to hang your clothes when you get tired after a couple weeks.
1,Noise is killing any advantage of this machine.,"I don't have anything to add to the guys who had this experience with squeaking noise of this Gazelle. Just wanted to say that I had the same problem, and wanted to add my bad rate star in order to help future customers to know, that Gazelle is good only when you watch it on TV commercial. Maybe they used the best machine for demonstration, but my machine was cheap assembled. After I assembled this machine, it was not stable on one of the sides. I added washers (which were already prepared for this known issue), but nothing changed. The second day, the squeaking noise appeared. Next day it came louder...After a week of usage, I am packing it back for return. I did my research beforehand and bought it in my local Walmart, so I don't expect any problems to return it back. Hope it will help others to make their choice."
4,Gazelle Freestyle,"I've only used it for a couple of weeks. It seems to work as advertised, is quiet and gives a pretty good workout. If it holds together as long as my old nordic track, it will prove to be a great value."
2,Gazelle Training Tool,Good price - Fast delivery - Electronics part broken before or during shipping - DVD doesn't include promissed assembly instructions - Work days and can't call their help line. Seems to be a neat unit - quiet to run and easy to assemble.
3,Gazelle,I use it twice a day. Its not designed as well as the original gazelle and makes funny sounds.
3,Sqeaky and Unhappy,"This thing after only about 12 times of use is already making noise,it sqeaks with every movement.It is scary thinking what's it going to be like in 6 months."
3,okay for beginners,"My family has had this for about ayear and a half. While it is good for people that have problems with other forms of exercise because of their knees, backs etc., it isn't good for an advanced athlete. You have to remember that Tony Little was on camera under bright lights. A lot of men sweat when under those lights even if they aren't exercising. Anyway, for an advanced athlete, it really takes a long time to get a really good workout on this machine. But what they say about low impact on knees is true so if you can't do most of the other workouts, this will work for you. It would also be good for a beginner or somebody with a low to moderate fitness level."
4,I LOVE THIS MACHINE,"If you are a parent and can't get to the gym, I would suggest you get the Gazelle. I got mine for only $25 and what a bargin. I really love this machine. I usually watch TV or listen to music while working out. When I am on the Gazelle time goes by sooo fast. Before you know it, it's time for me to head to work. HOWEVER, like many reviewers my Gazelle did make noise (that's why I gave it four stars). I brought WD40 and the squeaking did stop. Hope this was helpful."
4,very satisfied,"Was not hard to asemble(for my husband)a very satisfactory work out,really kind of fun.Very pleased.Quiet operation, I can watch TV."
3,something odd going on,"Vladar's Sony Diabelli Vars may be very fine, but I have what I consider the finest recording, by Stephen Kovacevich, from the early 1970s, out of print on the Philips Virtuoso label (422 969-2). Or so I believe it to be. Got it from Amazon UK, the last one, or one of them. Why mention this here? Because when you play this CD on a PC or CDP that shows the metadata, all of the information says it is the Stefan Vladar recording! It even shows the right Sony label number and the photo shown here for the Vladar CD. Hmm. Very strange manufacturing error. Unless, of course, it really is the Vladar version, and he plays it exactly like Kovacevich (Bishop at the time of the recording), and I just got it in a Philips Virtuoso box with a Philips Virtuoso label and nomenclature! Anyone ever heard of such a mixup??"
4,Truly Enjoyable for Cat Lovers,"A well written book going into some of the most commen problems facing cats today. Nicholas Dodman cares very deeply about the animals he writes about and is very concerned with quality of life issues for cats. His annecdotal style was fun to read, and he always let you know about the outcomes of his treatments and how the animals fared. As a cat owner and lover, it was truly a pleasure to read, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about their pets and trying to give them the best life possible."
1,disapointment,"Dr. Dodman seems to rely on medications for cats, and this book is basically stories of his patients, there behavior problems, and why medication worked. This book was written in 1997 and has an outdated feel. He lost me with his letter about indoor and outdoor cats in reply to someone who wrote him. I don't think id want him as a vet and i wish i didn't order his book."
2,BuSpar Feline Nation; Listening to Buspirone,"Dodson writes well and describes cats with affection. In virtually every case, however, the afflicted cat ends up being treated with buspirone. (Dodson does not mention any tips on how to get cats to take the pills.)I STOPPED reading on page 115--about half-way through the book when yet another cat was medicated. At the bottom of page 115 Dodson reveals that he has a patent on buspirone. Dodson has, according to the back jacket of the book ""four patents for the pharmacological control of behavior problems"".While behavior problems can and should be humanely addressed, I wonder if forcing pills on cats cannot end up being counter-productive. Certainly it can help some of the time, especially if your cat likes to take pills. But the book ends up reading like one long advertisement for feline SSRI's."
2,disappointed,"This book was entertaining, but... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of ""inappropriate elimination"" (peeing/pooping in the wrong place), even though the author himself describes it as ""the number one behavior problem"". He says ""No other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia"". I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic??? The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them). Throughout the book, I wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions."
4,"Great for Cat Owners with ""Crazy"" Cats.","I have a cat that acts insane sometimes and this book helped me understand what he was doing, why he was doing it, and what to do to fix the problem.What I didn't like is his answer for most behaviors is medication...which I don't agree with.He's also anti-declawing and goes on about that for way too long. Otherwise, informative book."
3,"Not the best out there, but passable","Dian Dincin Buchman is well revered by some aspiring herbalists in the natural medicine crowd, and while I enjoyed her ""Herbal Medicine"", this sadly doesn't help many who are looking for much assistance in 'natural beauty.'There are of course saving graces. Facial exercises, herbs that are good for skin cleansing, natural deodorants and tooth powders come in handy, but there are many recipes out there just as effective, simple, and safe - just a bit better. I would have preferred more advancement here, something a bit more complex and indepth, but if you're in the mood for a light, informative enough text that doesn't delve that far, this ones for you."
2,The detailed illustrations are useless!,"While this may be a serious study of moulding theory, the detailed drawing and illustrations provided are of little or no use. The 6"" X 9"" format is partly to blame and less than full page views for what were surely at least 18"" X 24"" drawings originally. Illustrations and drawings are essential for me to benefit from a book of this nature. I was very disappointed."
2,Home Study,Be forewarned that this is a textbook for serious students interested in the historic use of moldings. If not willing to hunker down and learn you will be bored. If however earnest in pursuit of essential knowledge on the subject the tome will be enlightening. For the professional this is an invaluable research library addition.
4,"Important, well made, focused on personalities.","This is from the perspective of someone who hasn't seen ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" First, ""Revenge"" works well as a standalone film. You don't have to see the first to see the second. Plenty of celebrities and personalities (Lutz, Musk) if you're into that kind of thing. Even Tom Friedman makes an appearance. I would have liked more of you and me.Anyway, it covers an important issue, with high production values. All in all, a well made documentary worthy of your time."
4,Cool & clever,"I liked it, it tells a lot about the continuing history of electric car evolution. For those of you that have seen ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" it revisits some of the key pundits from that movie and their evolution as well. worth the watch."
3,It's Okay,"I enjoyed this documentary but I will say that if you are expecting the exciting conspiracy nature of ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" you won't find it here. This is a good but not knuckle-clutching documentary that brings you somewhat up to date with regard to the Electric Car. However, if you are expecting some vindicating revenge for the fate of the Electric Car in the first documentary, you will not feel fulfilled. Like so many sequels, I found this to be anticlimactic."
1,Tivo Rental Missing Audio Tracks,"I rented ""Revenge of the Electric Car"" on my Tivo.When I tried to play it the audio had only the narrator and the background music. I couldn't hear any of the speakers. The movie was worthless to me.I do not see a way to contact Amazon Customer Service about this."
4,Interesting history of an industry,"This is very much a documentary, but the title is a bit misleading. The electric car is still alive and kicking, but is far from having gotten revenge. This tells the story of the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt, Tesla Motors, and several smaller electric car ventures. The filmmakers have gotten unbelievable access to the movers and shakers in this industry like Elon Musk, Bob Lutz, and Carlos Ghosn. Most of the people I wasn't familiar with. The story of the development of this industry was also largely unknown to me. They not only covered the major automakers, though. There is also apparently a large underground movement of private individuals out there building or retrofitting their own cars to be electric. The in and outs of this movement were surprisingly dramatic to me. If you're at all interested in this topic, the movie will give you a great overview of how we've gotten where we are now and where we may be going."
2,Great Sound Qualiy - Horrible Durability,"I was given these headphones as a gift and while the sound quality was fantastic, the build quality was almost the exact opposite.Everything about these headphones is cheap and flimsy. Several months into their use I started to hear rattling plastic where the earpieces connect to the headband. Several months after that the piece broke clean off and revealed that it was only held together with three tiny screws.These headphones have an extremely high retail price but are about as durable as a $20 off-brand set of headphones."
2,incredible sound with cheap plastic head band,I bought 2 of these in about a year and a half. Mind blowing sound and bass is unreal but they fall apart. I still have them and they sound great if you hold them up to your ears.
2,"There always must be a ""but . . . ""","The performance of these are second to none, especially in their price class. BUT they are cheaply made and easily damaged. Mine have only been used when attached to a computer and they are being held together with epoxy and plastic ties. What can you expect from a Chinese export?"
3,"Good, yes. Great, no.","I bought these headphones a few weeks ago.IMO, they make the highs too high and don't make bass as deep as they should ... for the most part.I wear glasses and don't find them overly comfortable, but suspect that has more to do with my glasses than the headphones themselves.They're solid, but unspectacular, peformers on my iPod ... and a tad disappointing on my home PC.They desperately need better bass, in my opinion.That said, there are times when they sound spectacular. They're just not consistent enough."
2,"Great sound, weak construction","These headphones offer great sound and comfort, but they will probably spontaneously break in about a year. The wire near the L-shaped jack that goes into my playing device wore out for me twice, each lasting about a year. Note that I wrapped the area around the jack with electrical tape, which extended the life of my second pair, but nevertheless, it eventually wore out. You may think that a year is a decent amount of time to get out of a pair of headphones, but I believe that if you pay $140 for headphones you should be able to hand them down to your children, and they hand it down to theirs!"
3,"Great sound, cheap build","I adored these phones with all my heart, and then something went awry in the jack's wiring, and now must be twisted into submission to get both sides of the stereo through. So it's probably best never to move them from your home, which is sad thing."
3,NOT worth the money I paid,BUT they are good head phones.. wish they put out a lil more bass.. but crystal clear sounds fill your ear with these babies on your head.Cons (you look sorta goofy wearing them)(not worth 150$ Plus)
1,disappointment,"I purchased my around-the-ear headphones at an Apple store in 2009 or 2010. I liked the comfort but I soon found that the sound was inferior to aPlantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume. A couple of months ago the earpieces fell out of their snapped in positions at the ends of the piece that goes around your head. I thought I could snap those pieces back in but, after several failed attempts I decided that I couldn't. So ... into the trash."
1,Good Sound Poor Quality,These headphones sound good and are light weight but ..... The quality of the ear cushions are really poor. For what you pay for these headphones you would think the cushions would not rot out as mine did. The worst part is they are NOT REPLACEABLE like the Shure brand of head phones in the same price range. Don't waste your money on BOSE buy the Shure SRH440 or SRH480 Headphones.
5,Bose around-ear headphones,"This product was a gift, but I also was able to use it. It is very comfortable around my ears and the adjustable headband makes the fit better since I have a small head. The headphones are easy to use and as the box and description say it is NOT noise canceling, so you can hear surrounding sounds if your volume is low enough. You kind of are just paying for the name, personally I would have went with a different brand but as I said it was a gift and the recipient was very happy with it :) When the product shipped it did come in a another box but there was a handle opening in the box or something and it would be possible to look into the hole and see what was inside since the earphone factory box wasn't concealed in any way. There also wasn't much protective wrapping or insulation surrounding the earphones which I would think it should have came with. The main use that we have used it for was for music, movies are next. Happy shopping~"
2,Sounds good but man are these things fragile,When I bought these phones I thought they were awesome. The sound was rich and crisp. The problem is that they broke with very normal wear/tear in about two months. I wear headphones almost every day at work taking them on/off 4-5 times a day. Within two months I had snapped the cheap plastic band. I called Bose and talked to them about a design flaw and they told me it was my fault for being too rough with them. Now I don't have an extremely large head and I definitely was not rough with them (My 5 year old Sony pair held up fine). I would say pass and get anything else.The get two stars because man when they weren't broken they sounded so good.
2,Durable in terms of structure but pads are destroyed in 1 year,"I must admit these headphones are one of the most comfortable and durable I ever had. What I am disappointed about are the pads. They are not a giniune leather or a solid tissue, they are made of a sponge painted with a black color, which is now peeling off in small black pieces revealing the gray synthetic sponge of the pads. All my ears and neck are full of those remains of the black paint. So I had to dispose these earphones eventhough they were fully functioning. What a disappointment about Bose, never thought they would be producing such low quality pads for their earphones. Lessons learnt, will not be buying this brand anymore."
2,"A rip off, don't buy!","The sound quality on these 'phones is maybe just barely acceptable for the price, but the extremely flimsy construction is just pathetic. The plastic material on the bands near the cups is really weak and will break eventually, probably sooner then later. I've had to preform surgery with tape a number of times and they're still falling apart and I know other people who bought them and ended up in the same position.It seems like you're paying for the cost of the name Bose. But if you want something that's not going to fall apart in 6-8 months, look elsewhere."
1,Break apart very easily,"I have owned two of these headphones (got one as a present) and they both broke on me. They also broke at the same place, the plastic that keeps the ear cup attached just snaps in half. I take GREAT care of my expensive stuff and still had both of them fall apart on me.Stay away. They sound good but the build quality needs a lot of improvement."
3,Not as good as Sony MDR-V6 for sound,"I have a pair of Sony MDR-V6 phones that sound incredible. I'm talking Superb sound. They are only about $65, too. However, I had to sacrifice sound for comfort. The Sony's are way too heavy and pinch my ears if I use them longer than 20 minutes. I'm constantly pulling them away from my ears for relief. I tried for a few weeks to tolerate them because of the exceptional sound, but I had to return and get the Triports for comfort. I have tested these Bose side by side with my Sony's, and the bass on these is way less than the rich sound of my Sony's. I'm disappointed that I paid more than double for these. And....I'm afraid the Bose are going to break if I don't be super careful. Definitely won't let my kids use these. But the comfort is 100x better than my Sony's. I do like the Bose, just not worth $140 after i've already heard the sound out of the $65 Sony's."
4,Item was found for lower price at Sams,"Unfortunately,I found the item for $20 less at Sams Club but product is fine. Can you match the price? please respond"
3,Not the highest quality,"This is the first and probably the last Bose product I have ever owned.(it was a gift) I had read the reviews on how easy these were to break, so I took extra caution. It took about a year before mine snapped. The plastic is very thin where the fork holds the can and thats where it broke. I managed to repair them myself by building up JB Weld (I know thats harsh but it was all I had) in the groove on the back side and shot it with black paint. You have to get pretty close to see the repair and it is strong enough now that it should not break in the same spot again. I may go ahead and fix up the other side before it breaks! The bad stuff aside, these are pretty comfortable and the sound quality is very good but not exceptional in my opinion. Unless you have your heart set on Bose, I would think you could find better headphones in this price range."
1,"Expensive, low quality and unreliable components",I bought these headphones looking for a high quality set. I have been greatly disapointed by the now 5th break of the too long cord which I had to superglue on the base of each ear and on the jack angle... The leather is just average and the component inside is not exactly top of the range which I find very disapointed at 150$ a piece. I should have bought 3 at 50$ each. I would have received the same sound quality and not wasted my time fixing and looking on how to fix them...
3,"Good sound, lousy craftsmanship","I won't deny that the sound quality of the Bose around ear headphones is superior to many other brands. My peeve with this product concerns the plastic headband which is just plain lousy. I had my headphones stored in the carry bag. They dropped from perhaps knee height. Upon opening the bag I discovered that one of the earpieces had broken off.Apparently the Bose definition of ""Light and Portable"" is shabby construction with cheap parts.For the amount I paid for these headphones I expected a little more quality. I've owned many other brands that weren't even half as expensive and have lasted through many years of use. My ultimate word of warning is this: unless you treat these things like a ming vase they are eventually going to break. For something bearing the ""Bose"" name, I expected a little more than this."
2,"Good audio, bad quality","These headphones have better quality than I'd expect for the price. That's at the expense of quality, though. I've never so much as taken them from my room, but the plastic pieces connecting the actual ear phones to the head band just gave way (while I was listening to them, not even in taking them off or putting them on!). Bad quality, don't expect them to last more than a year at most."
4,"Light weight, VERY comfortable, and best of all...","they sound incredible. Based on those three factors I have to say its been worth every penny. You get the benefits typical of around-ear headphones but not the bulk that comes with it. With these headphones I'm enjoying my music in a way that I haven't done in a long time. With that said, I would not recommend them for working out or dj'ing. The weight may a factor but they do strike me as somewhat fragile. I have read reports of them breaking easily but so far I have not had a problem. I use them strictly for casual listening and at that they shine.Enjoy!"
3,poor build quality,"I liked these headphones so much I bought a second pair after my first broke. (plastic holding ear pad broke) The headphone jack broke on the second pair broke. Yes, they are comfortable, light weight, good bass, but gotta mark it down given the poor build quality. Also, at this price range they are bested by other products such as Audio Technica ATH-A700 Headphones."
2,Do not purchase,"I've had two pairs of these. When I bought the first pair, I didn't know much about headphones. I am still learning, but what I've come to realize is that these are not very much better than an inexpensively priced pair of Koss headphones I own. Also, the frames on these broke (first one earphone, then the other after I taped it up) and even under the manufacturer warranty, they wanted $80+shipping just to fix it. Big ripoff. They are not manufactured well and are marketed specifically to the type of people who would immediately think ""oh wow, bose headphones, they must be good so i'll buy them without doing research."" If you're looking at these, instead consider something in the $50-100 range from sennheiser."
4,a little over priced!,"These head phones were a present.They were very comfortable.They block some of the external sound but not totaly. The sound quality was not worth the cost at all. I have standard Ipod earbuds that came with my Ipod and they sound 20 percent better.The length of cord is nice but it did not have a volume control on the wire like the ipod one does.I would buy one for a child but I feel the price should be more like 39.95 for the sound quality.The volume was also not as loud as the ipod ear buds with the same player same song side by side comparing.One great thing I discovered is the wire comes unplugged from the headset at the base of the ear muff, if you get caught on something.This shurely saved me ruining another headset when on the treadmill!"
4,Not worth the money,I bought a pair of these at Best Buy a couple years ago. They broke within a year of use. The cable covering came off next to the earphone.. They sound really good but are not nearly as good as they should be for the price. I bought some Sony MDR-7506's a few weeks ago for only $84 and they sound WAY better and built far better in terms of durability. Save your money.
2,"Good sound, comfortable, but poor quality","The sound from these headphones is good, and they are very comfortable to wear. However, even though I am very careful when handling the headphones, shortly after the warranty expired, the plastic connecting the earpiece to the headband broke on one side, and it was only a few months later that the other side broke as well. Considering the price we paid for these, I was determined to keep them usable. With the help of some floral wire and duct tape (super glue didn't work), I was able to reattach the earpieces, although the noticeable repair is a constant reminder of Bose's poor quality and/or design. As these were a gift from my husband, I was not able to read the reviews prior to purchasing. Had I known about the defects, I probably would have chosen another brand. Now I guess I can look forward to the earpads deteriorating!"
1,"Poor design, good sound","The sound is great, the construction is poor. The plastic head piece broke within a very short period of time where the metal slides in from the ear cover. This is the exact location it has broken for everyone I know who owns this headphone. I find it hard to believe that Bose doesn't know about this and has chosen to ignore the problem."
1,Similar problems with earphone breakage...,"I've had the exact same problem many others have mentioned. The plastic circle piece that holds the earphone on just breaks.I also have a large head, and have found that the thin bar digs into your head when wearing the phones for long periods."
3,"Great sound, terrible quality.","Length:: 1:35 MinsBose headphones sound great, but they are cheaply made and fall apart in under two years. So, if you're only interested in using them for a year, go ahead, they sound wonderful. But, if you are looking for a more long term investment, shop around, because these are not worth the price."
1,Shockingly poor quality,Stay away from Bose Triport (Over the Ear) headphones. I keep mine next to my computer desk and only use them with my computer. a very stable environment. within the first year the ear pads began to deteriorate. The fake leather began to flack off and sticks to my ears! Then the material started to come apart revealing the cheap foam underneath. They soon became unwearable! I know of others experiencing the same problem. I sent an e-mail to Bose complaining of their quality. Their only response is they will sell you the same defective replacement cushions for only $35 plus $7 shipping! What a deal!
1,Horrible Design...,"I have purchased one pair of headphones and another was given to me as a gift, and both broke in a span of 6 months. You fork out 140 for a pair of great sounding headphones that have the built of a cheap 10 dollar plastic frame. Bose basically suckers people into buying these horrendously made headphones. Unless you want to pay 200 for the ones that are more reinforced."
2,"Built poorly, way over-priced for what it is.","Only Bose can fool you with its name and be able to sell crap headphones for over $100. The sound quality is better than that of a cheap radio shack or walmart pair, but nowhere near of what it SHOULD be for the price range that it's in. My Bose headphones broke after not even a year of having them. The 3 tiny screws holding the speaker cup onto the bracket finally let loose once the cheapo plastic piece that they actually screw into cracked. Bose will not fix it. Almost every audiophile nowadays will tell you that Bose is overprice junk.If you want some advice on what to actually buy, I suggest looking at what Grado Labs, Inc. makes. For $99 you can get some headphones that will blow these Bose set's audio quality right out of the water. Every audiophile swears by Grado Labs, so I bought their SR80i and it makes me not want to touch any other brand ever again."
3,"High Price Sound, Lousy Build Quality","Pros:- Very nice sound with all types of music- Very Comfortable- Great Noise CancelingCons:- Very thin, long cord, not durable, gets caught on EVERYTHING- Stitching on ear pads can come undone, able to see foam inside- Able to see the guts just by looking inside the cansI ultimately had these for 2 years before they were of no use anymore."
2,breaks easy,"the speaker connection is poorly engineered and breaks easy, had to use super glue to make work also the pads cracked and ripped after 1 & 1/2 years, poor quality. sound is good but for price, poorly made, cheap."
1,Dissappointing,"The announcement states that the item is in ""acceptable condition"". But when I got it from the mail and opened the package, I was shocked to see a badly fixed up Bose earphones with electric and medical bandages that made the earphones unidentifiable and generally ""unaccaeptable"". I wish I could attach a photo of the item... I decided to just return the item and get refunded due to the bad shape of the item's appearance which I described with the seller as a ""War Veteran Bose Earphones"" that needed to retire from it's purpose. It's just so dissapointing how details of the for sale items not totally being disclosed on the website's announcements and I hope that Amazon can screen these better in the future. Though I'd like to mention that the vendor was propmt enough in responding to my emails and the refund on this transaction which I'm still currently monitoring on my accounts. Maybe it's a matter of a gamble each time you make a transaction online especially if it's used items..."
4,Excellent Value,This product is great. It gives you a lot for its value. You can clean practically every part of your camera (binoculars) with it.
2,Not really a lipstick,"This wild white lipstick is really a lip gloss and is fine for that purpose. I was looking for a base color to mix with other lipstick colors as I like to create my own shades. This ""lipstick"" does not work for that purpose and I was disappointed with my purchase."
3,"Tasty, may try it again","Made the entire pouch with water heated in the microwave, stirred, removed most of air and zipped pouch shut. Took out about half, added some shredded cheese and a few crackers. First bite left a taste I couldn't quite place, eventually found the red onions that I try to avoid. Onions retain a slightly off texture. Over all, not bad - may consider taking on next India run, travel delays and dramatic time zone shifts do rearrange your eating patterns. Need to figure out how to split a pouch and get and maintain an even mix of contents.Had the remainder rewarmed, was better the first time, less oniony.Product arrived on time and as described."
2,Save Your Money -- Borrow It,"A book about scrapbooking must have pictures; at least, that's how I feel. One can learn about supplies, paper quality, etc. from a knowledgeable shop-person. Layouts on the other hand requite creativity, and sometimes you need to see a few to get an idea. Further, there aren't enough pictures of the techniques that the author tries to explain. In scrapbooking, a picture is worth 1000 words. I would recommend going to your library and looking through whatever they might have before choosing one or two scrapbooking books to buy."
4,Perfect for new scrapbookers,"This book provided the help I needed to get started with scrapbooking. Ms. Barr takes you step by step through the process and offers ideas that are simple, but look great! Even the most unartistic person can create scrapbook pages they can't wait to share. I've recommended this book to several friends, and we refer to it often when we get together to work on our books. I don't even need to order doubles of my pictures anymore. If I mess up, Ms. Barr offers ideas on how to get around it and make my pages still look amazing. Very helpful!"
2,Really outdated,This book was written before digital photography was the norm. There have been so many tools and techniques introduced in the past ten years that it's just not that helpful. An updated version would be very welcome!
3,back to cars... ?,"Encouraging a new generation to be hooked on gasolineis not my idea of entertainment to enlighten kids.Sponsored my sugar covered coco sugar balls tomake your couch potatoes future high blood pressuredlow metabolic diabetics...Slick Japanese style game boy animation and villains ofthe old school too.I say let the past of racing stay dead.We have a poster here in Lakeside of Barney Oldfield At Lakeside Track, April 1907, on the coffee shop external wall."
4,Real life situations piled and filed humerously :-),"Finally someone who takes a real life approach to the complex world of household management...or at the very least taming it!!! I could relate to so many of the situations and the help Karen offers is so real! I am not a misfit...I just have bent chromosomes and that is OK! Filled with funny stories too, can't wait for the other books to hit the market! Keep up the GREAT work Karen."
4,The American Orient Express,"Very good DVD, disapponted it was more about the trip, and less about the equipment. All in all, very very nice. A shame it no longer is in operation."
2,Very frustrating,"I hate this Superman set and returned it. I buyALL the Justice League action figures, etc. for my son, but the bricks on this one don't stay up - very frustrating. Buy it just for the action figure, but don't get excited about the bricks."
2,Love it but,Love the bird feeder but the package was bad packaging did not havethe bobbl wrap the box was badand did not stay together there was a crake in the glass I didnotsend back because it cost more to send back and it was to much money for the bird feeder so was not happy
2,Disappointed,"The feeder is very pretty, but it leaks. We put the hummingbird food inside and it leaked out. Very disappointing!"
1,Useless,"Received this feeder as a gift. Pretty enough to look at. However, when I filled it, it leaked all over. Tried several ways to stop the leakage but no luck. After closer inspection I discovered the bottom did not fit properly and had been damaged in shipping, thus sugary food dripped out. None of the packaging could be recovered so can't send it back. Into the trash bin it goes."
2,"Beautiful, but not sturdy","this is a beautifu hummingbird feeder, but when I got it , it quickly fell apart. I wasn't able to use it. Too bad, because it is really eye catching."
2,Not very Pretty,This feeder is not very pretty. I can not give a rating based on how well it works as I did not use it.
4,Metal Detector,"I bought 2 of these for our grandsons for their 11th birthday and they work fine. So far they haven't found any treasures, but have had fun with them. One word of advice, the boys are small for their age so the length fits them fine, but the detectors don't extend out too far so I am not so sure they would work very well for a bigger/taller child."
5,fine little detector,"this little thing works great! my 8 year old son wanted a metal detector for xmas, so i thought for the price i would try this one. i took him to the park and we had a blast! would recommend for starting out with."
4,"i liked it, and our grandson seemed to like it also.","It seems to work very well. We tried it indoors. Our grandchildren are looking forward to summer, when they can try it at the beach."
3,Cheap but works moderately well,"I purchased this model metal detector because it is cheap and I figured it would be adequate for the job I had in mind - finding locations of pipes that indicated property lines. It did that just fine. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is serious about finding things. It would be OK for kids, which is who it is designed/advertised for."
5,Great Family Fun!,"This is a great little gift to give your young daughter or son! I gave this dectector to my 6 year old daughter for Christmas, so she could hunt for treasure just like daddy does with his metal detector. Kids love treasure hunting and this product proved to be just the right size for little ones. It also functioned well and was easy for her to learn how it worked. I'd recommend it for anyone seeking to find a great gift that will provide years of outdoor activity and fun. It's educational, fun, and is a product they can use alone or as a family/group activity. I give the Bounty Hunter Junior Size Metal Detector 5 stars!"
5,Great value for Price,"We purchased this metal detector because my husband lost his wedding ring in the back yard while doing yard work. We found his ring along with other metal objects like a wood burning stove door, box cars, and other metal objects buried in the dirt. It was cheap and most importantly found his wedding ring."
4,Great Detector for the Price,I bought this for the beach. It was able to find many bottle caps buried 3-4 inches beneath the sand. Tried it on coins buried 2-3 inches down and it found all of them. Back at home it found two AL beer cans buried 6-7 inches beneath the surface. I think it's a great detector for the money.
1,"Arrived defective; exchange not offered, return only.","Well, bought this for Christmas, so I didn't open it until today. Problem? It arrived defective. One of the battery connections was not assembled properly, so it is not usable. I will return it to Amazon; WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS EXCHANGE IT FOR ONE THAT WORKS, THOUGH. No, that's not an option. Thanks for nothing, Amazon, especially now that it's more costly now than when I bought it. I'll go to Big Lots and get one and see it up close before I bother with Amazon again.BUT AT YOUR OWN RISK.NOTE: After further reflection, I contacted the company that made the thing. I'll let you know what happens, especially as this bad boy is supposed to have a five-year warranty.NOTE 2: After repeatedly contacting the company, I heard nothing, so I'm returning it to Amazon for a credit.Sorry, folks."
1,This is a toy,"I bought this for my son's 10 yr birthday, as he is fascinated with finding things. I liked the advertised size/weight, and the reviews on Amazon were really good. After receiving it and trying it, I wonder exactly what the people who bought this are doing with it! Detection requires the object to be within inches - as in 2-3 inches. The advertised ""up to 5 inches underground"" is unattainable.I still believe my son would like a REAL metal detector, so I am boxing this up to return it and we'll review some real ones online that are appropriate for kids. I strongly suggest looking at other products, even for smaller kids, as this detector is just a little beeping (bleeping?) toy ... if you get the objects close enough."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I bought this product for my daughter a month and I must say it was a complete disappointment. It ran out of battery within the first 10mintues of using it and all it did was make a soft ticking noise and never actually detected any metal. After a week of turning nobs and replacing batteries, we decided to put a quarter underneath it to test if it really was a piece of junk. This metal detector didn't detect the quarter, of course. We turned the nobs accordingly and did everything to try and make it work. We read the instructions and did several tests but now it just hangs in our garage, dusty and unused. This thing is a waste of your money. If looking for a cool gadget for your child, please splurge just a little bit more and get something that isn't a total disappointment."
3,Bounty Hunter,"Bought this for my 7yr old to go explore.....It looks good and did not break the bank. It picks up well- stuff that is on the surface, but I doubt you would ever find anything ""BURIED""..take it for what it is-A Toy.."
1,missing part,"The Junior metal detector arrived promptly. Before wrapping the birthday gift for our grandson, I decided to put batteries in it so hecould start to use it after unwrapping the surprise gift. BAD NEWS........the battery cover is missing, I double checked the box as didmy husband, but its totally missing. What a disappointment!!Hopefully someone will read this review and get a cover in the mail. Thank you,"
2,ok,Works as good as $50.00 dollars buys anyone. Could work much better if you ask me. Bought this for my daughter and she liked it at first and then said it stopped working after 2 weeks.
5,Great product for the price,I really think this is a great product for the price and will at getting me one for use on the beach
3,works ok,not that great it only beeps and the needles goes all the way up no matter how big the metal item is. It found a small piece of aluminum foil in yard. it works ok
2,Bounty Hunter BHjS Junmior Metal Detector,"It was possibly defective. In any event, it failed to operate properly. After putting in the battery, and holding it near metal, it sometimes indicated with the signal and sometimes it did not. Even holding it near the same metal object."
5,works great for my application,"i bought it to find the lot line stakes in my yard. it found them no problem. one was 3 inches below the surface. also found some pennies and some other junk that i didn't really want to find. then i read the directions and learned how to turn the sensitivity down so i didn't find those small objects. i noticed it finds the re-bar inside my concrete driveway too. that wasn't particularly usefull, but it was fun to play with for a few seconds."
3,Good for starters but don't get your hopes up,"I bought this for my 7-year old because he was begging for a metal detector for his birthday. We received the BH Junior Metal Detector, slapped in the batteries, and went prospecting in our backyard. The sensitivity knob is not linear at all. It's either extremely sensitive or doesn't pick up much of anything. We were able to dig up a buried strand of barbed wire and a few nails, but I think it was more luck than a direct result of the device helping us.I would say this is good as a novelty but if you want something serious, consider a better detector."
3,pretty good for the price,"I bought this for my 8 yr old son who wanted a ""real"" metal detector for Christmas. After reading a lot of reviews I settled on this one. We live on a few acres so we weren't sure what would happen. We did plant a few coins which he found right away and then he started to find other items! Even buried 3-5 inches deep! This was very cool and pretty soon the other ""boys"" wanted to join in (my husband and Dad too). We found old nails, cans, some kind of tool part, etc. For the price, this is a very fun and easy to use toy/tool. I would recommend it for the amateur-out-for-fun person, not a serious, I-am-looking-for-treasure person."
4,40north,"Seems to work fine for the price. Trying to find an underground tank, then learned that not likely any rebar in the tank! Glad I did not buy a more expensive one."
4,Seems to work well,Purchased it for my 10 year old daughter. There is currently too much snow to test it outdoors but it locates all of the nails below our wooden (hard wood) floors. We are looking forward to using it on our camping trips.
3,it works,"Pros: cheap price, fast chippingCon: doesn't really find gold but will find metalThe only reason i bought this was to find a $3,000 dollar earing i lost.I waived it over the one i had left and didnt even pick it up."
4,Grandson was pleased so I'm happy.,I was pleased that it extends to a longer length for older kids. Seems to work ok but we haven't had a lot of time to play with it yet.
4,dector,"This was ordered as a gift for one of my grandson's, so I can not comment of how well it works until after he receives it as a Christmas gift."
3,Will do for now...,"Im a little disappointed in this item. However, we are not talking about an outright, full functioning detector. This is a childs detector to start them in the field of metal detecting. Its not very strong in its function. You have to literally be right up on a piece of metal for it to beep. The other reviews state this and some others dont. Unless the metal is on the surface, I dont think it will do much good. But, Ill keep this so my son can learn the basics. I would suggest to save up ur money and buy one a little better than this cheap model. You get what you pay for."
2,Bounty Hunter BHJS Jr. Metal Detector,"The Bounty Hunter arrived before my grandson got home from school. Prior to him coming home I ""salted"" the ground including grass and dirt with quarters. When he arrived we fine tuned the detector as the instructions required then headed outside. Well I should have marked all the areas buried the ""treasure"". We were unable to locate about $1.50 and the ones we did locate took quite a bit of time. Even the coins in the short grass we had to actually make contact with the grass before any signal would eminate.I was more disappointed than my grandson. We both knew this was a ""toy"" but I was expecting more. More being that the coil of the detector shouldn't have to be nearly touching the object(s) you scan for."
3,"Kid size, but doesnt really work",My son has yet to find anything...seems to only pick up pipes under the ground. NOt to happy with it...would not buy again.
5,Great,"My 7 yr asked for this for his birthday, looked at the cheaper one Fromm toy r us but because of the reviews went with this oneHe plays for hours outside in our yard. It works very well !!!Only issue is my son digs up the yard!!!!"
2,Kind of chinsy,If your in the market for a Metal Detector...spend more. There is a reason why brands like Whites cost more.This one here...well it will find an obvious coin on the surface if you know where it is.It did ship promptly and well packaged.
3,OK metal detector,"Item seems to be only marginally useful. It does detect metal, but I'm not sure it would find anything underneath the sand. Fun toy for kids, but not sure you can actually discover much with it."
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas 2012. She was able to use it that day to find a few coins I hid in the snow. It seemed to work as expected. The next time it was nice enough to use it outside, it did not work. The signal needle was stuck and the eliminator knob did not adjust the signal. Of course we had missed the return date. $50 dollars down the drain. Don't buy this unit."
4,Good little Detector,"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter, This weekend I will see how she likes it. The price was good and it seems to detect well. I have used it a little just to test it's operation and it detects well enough and the discrimination seems pretty good for a detector in this low of a price range. I will update after this weekend, I Buried $3.00 worth of pocket change in the backyard so she really gets to test it out!"
1,Does not work at the beach,I was very disappointed with this product. I purchased it for my daughter to use at the beach. It did not work at all. I even placed my own quarter in the sand and it would only detect it if it was sitting right on top. It would not pick it up if a tiny bit of sand was on top of it. My brother in law had the same metal detector for his son and they had the exact same results as we did. It was a big let down. We used it in the backyard and found nails. Not very exciting!
1,Over priced,I can't find in store so I bought it via web site.It's over priced with same product only if I can find in regular storeMaybe that's why is so expense- doubled price than Chollocate one you can find in store
2,Doesn't taste good...,It had a horrible chalky taste and I could not find a way to make it taste better even when I added frozen fruit. It was still intolerable.
5,All you need is a sharp sword,"Although I didn't buy my Sting sword from Amazon, it is the sword made by the same manufacturer described here. My dad, who is a bit of an expert when it comes to knives, says that it is of good quality and it even has a very good balance and heft to it. It's not a toy, by any means, and is quite sharp. I had wanted to get Strider's ranger sword but it was much too long to fit in my check-in luggage! Sting in itelf is not a small weapon. I can just imagine going off with it to kill some orcs. It came with its own wooden mount and now hangs proudly in our movie den."
4,This gal should be better known.,"One of the best of the white Thirties ""girl singers."" A bit like the early Kay Starr. Best is the blues material, with small band accompaniment by Jack Teagrden, Charlie Shavers, Dave Barbour etc."
2,Read if you must,"This was a very strange tale of a woman who went from being someone, an individual, to being a means of procreation. The story takes you through the strange rituals of sexual intercourse and leaves you wondering if a society could ever really reduce itself to such means to ensure the survival of mankind. The main character must suffer the loss of not only her daughter and husband, but also her own identity and self-esteem. A very degrading tale of how women are sometimes viewed as an object to be used and discarded as men and people in power see fit. On the last page of this book one question came to mind. ""That's it?"". The ending was very disappointing. I really wish there could have been a little more information imparted as to the character's past. A name would heve been nice. But then again that may have spoiled the mystery. Overall, I found the book interesting but it left me unsatisfied. So what's the use?"
4,"Simple, basic software","Not a bad product, especially considering the price. I would recommend this for any home office needs. The spreads and database software are especially useful to me. It doesn't have Word, but does have Notepad. That's a very simple word processor and certainly would be enough for a high school student or someone working out of the home."
4,Word,"the only reason i bought this was because i didn't have microsoft word and i wanted it but the problem is trying to find it without having to buy the entire office program of works. i wish they would just sell it by itself. so instead of the Word program you get a word processor that only has a few small differences with the actual Word program like it is missing a built in Thesaraus. there are a few other small differences but the program is completely compatible with the Word program. you can save and edit Word documents. that was all i really wanted to begin with. so if you want a cheeper way to get Microsoft Word or something really similar to it, this is the way to go."
2,Not a bad product but there are better for product for free,I have been using Works for years as I had used Microsoft Office but I never used anything more than Works offered for a tenth of the price. The new version 8 is a good step up until I tried Sun Open Office which is free. This product is a full blown office suite and it is free. I doubt this will get posted but try both work and open office and see yourself
2,works8,"The software is very slick and easy to use but for one thingIT WILL NOT LET YOU DISABLE THE WORKS PORTFOLLIO FROM STARTING UP EACH TIME THE PC REBOOTS. there is no way to turn it off ,I am going to throw it out and revert to a previous version"
4,Michael's Works review,"This is a great program with everything I was looking for except, I was hoping for some fonts I needed. I had to buy them elsewhere."
5,Work perfectly with window 7 64 bits,I bought this program so I could open up tje work I had save on CD using an older computer. Had no problems with the program and found what I need on my CD. This was priced so that I felt it was reasonable to by this to solve my problem.
4,It is what it is.,"This is not MS Office. It is a smaller easier program to master and use. There are indeed free office programs out there that I have, and use, but when you get right down to it, MS Works can do 100% of what I need. And it does it faster. I am now using MS Works for a small business. I've found that this program will do that task, including job and accounting spreadsheets, just fine. For the cost of this group of programs, you just can't beat it."
4,Microsost Works,Computer crashed..Rebuilt from scratch. I have Microsoft Office 2010. but still liked certain things in Works..Item shipped quickly. All is well..4 stars
1,Illegal software is what I received.....,"FYI: Item was a CD that came with a previously owned PC, labeled NOT FOR RESALE. This was NOT software that the seller purchased himself but a CD that came free as part of a PC purchase. This was sold illegally. I'm just glad that my new laptop and Microsoft doesn't know this. While I am happy to have MS Works on my new laptop, I think it's wrong to sell something like this (although I won't have a problem since I have the proper key). (I had this happen before with an OS disc (Windows XP) I ordered (not knowing it was a mass production disc for a college) which ended up being useless on my work PC when MS Windows upgraded and discovered it. It put a big red flag on my PC which could not be removed until I had to re-buy the program with a proper key.) Buyers need to beware of sellers such as the one I bought from. See photo above for documentation!"
4,MS Works 8.0,"8.0 is an improvement over 7.0 in every category except the spreadsheet function. It doesn't have enough features, making it necessary to use Excel. Then again, one probably shouldn't expect it to be a full-featured spreadsheet since Works was apparently not intended to be business software. Well-designed program, though, and great for home applications."
3,"Warning: Incompatability with MSN 9, You lose spellcheck",MSN support AND Microsoft Works support have both told me that Works 8 has an incompatability with MSN 9 in that the spellcheck function does not work when writing an email using MSN. My understanding is that no fix is being worked on and none is expected.
1,Not worth it,"Don't even bother, unless you can get it free. Just download Open Office instead, http://www.openoffice.org/ and get all the functionality of a word processor, as well as a spreadsheet, presentation software (Power Point equivalent), and more, for free. I've used Works, Word (bundled with MS Office), and Open Office, and the only one that has any real benefits over the others is MS Office Professional and only if you need MS Access."
4,Microsoft Works,"This is a great substitute for ""Office"" if you don't want to pay that freight and costs a lot less. For all practical purposes, it has all the features of Office. It works for us as a small, new business."
4,Works that don't Work,There was a bug in the program where you could not copy and paste from Outlook Express. MicroSoft's help is out-sourced to some country like India and I never could get those people to understand what was wrong so I finally gave up.
4,hatchbob,"I've used the 'Works' program for many years, but the most recent computer that I bought form DELL had a hoky Word-Perfect program that I dislike.I'm very comfortable with the Works programs.I'm a retired senior citizen."
2,Is this MS works 8.0 software an upgrade?,My new Dell computer does not have word processor or office software installed on it. Is this product a stand alone program or just an upgrade?i need to know this before I order it. thank you.
4,rating of product,Very happy with this version of Microsoft Works. Works real well as good as other versions Of Microsoft Works and cost only $15.
1,Inadequate,"Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics. Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with ""page x of y"" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a ""feature"", you might as well simply use Wordpad.I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this.Recommendation: Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE."
3,Filler,"I used this until I got my new version of MS Word. For those who use Works over the MS word, its fine. But, for those who use Word, its just filler."
2,A Disappointment,Gene Griffin produced this r&b album with a heavy dose of hip/hop. I found this CD to be boring. It is no where near the quality of Griffin's best efforts of Today and Guy's first albums.(when he worked with Teddy Riley) It's not even as good as Griffin's post-Teddy Riley efforts of Mind & Basic Black. The whole album is amateurish and I regret buying this. I want to rate this higher as I own it & know it's hard to get and may even appreciate in value. But there's a very good reason why there haven't been many copies of this pressed and that's because it's a dog of a record and 2 stars might even be generous. Avoid.
2,Stop squirrels - not so much,"This is my second Homestead squirrel stop bird feeder. The old one was several years old, but a bear finally did it in. So, I quickly ordered the replacement, but was just as quickly disappointed. The first day, I saw that squirrels had figured out how to get into it. They get onto the feeding platform, then hook their rear claws between the glass and the top, then push lightly (like a bird) to get all the seed they want. Homestead must have changed the design because previously there wasn't enough room for the squirrels to get their grimy claws over the top of the glass. You can't caulk the space or anything, either, because it would prevent one from lifting the top and filling the feeder.At least it's summer and the birds can fend for themselves while I keep looking."
2,squirrels are too smart and agile for this product,"Despite there already being a review that said squirrel's could still access seed , I ordered one anyway.Well,my squirrels learned in a few hours how to hike their butts UP the plexiglass face,hook their toenails over a gap between the hood and front.They then, more or less, balance their front paws on a stationery part,stick their nose into the seed slots and proceed to feast away.I think the the ""storm hood"" extends a wee too far out allowing this balancing act.Slight design flaw has rendered a potentially great feeder into a buffett for squirrels."
3,Duncraft is Less Expensive,"I have not tried this bird feeder, but it is available for $10 less on the Duncraft website."
2,Major Design Flaw,"I Purchsed one of these,to replaced an older model one.I thought it was a good idea,because they put baffles in the feeder tray to help keep the seeds in it.Well a bad design,because they made the feed tray bigger than on the old one,so the bigger birds,crows,& blackbirds have found a way to bypass the feeder bar spring feature designed to keep bigger birds off of it,by standing sideways right on the feed tray.This is especially annoying,since my purpose is to feed cardinals and other smaller birds.They went through 2 pounds of feed in 1or 2 days!I just had to take it down and will put my other one up as soon as I replace the cracked plexiglass on it. I'm going to call the company to try and get a refund."
2,any squirrel feeder,"I purchased this bird feeder last fall and we were amazed how easy it was for all the neighborhood squirrels, red tail & black squirrels get to the bird feed. Within half a day they had every bid of the seed gone. I am very disappointed because we were thrilled to find a feeder that might just work. Now we do not have very many squirrels in our yard, but they sure have extended families!Sorry I must give this a 2 star only."
5,We've conquered the squirrels!!,"The sqirrels jump on the top of the feeders and at first they are puzzeled about it, can't get to the sides or back and then when they attempt to access the front they slide right off! Lot's of good entertainment!We now have 2 of these feeders and love them after spending a small fortune trying all the so called ""squirrel proof feeders"" costing $80-some odd dollars. These are a bargain at any price."
3,Difficult to hang from a hook!,"This is a very sturdy bird feeder, but it is very heavy when it is full, and I found it impossible to hang from a hook because I had to hold it from the bottom and it would not stay together when I tried to hang it from the hook. I guess I'll wait until next year and put up a pole to put it on."
5,Nearly a decade of use and still performing well.,"I've had mine for nearly a decade and though the paint is peeling, it still is stellar in performance. I use it as a hanging feeder, using long hanging wires so the squirrels cannot access it at all from the small branches. It is as near squirrel proof a feeder I've ever used. The squirrels don't hang around to harass the birds either, which is great. If the birds drop seeds below, the squirrels seem content to consume from the ground or move on to other feed stations that are less squirrel-proof. As others have said, I like that it is easy to clean and the over-hang of the roof seems to protect the seed from mild rain storms here in Florida."
3,No squirrels but few birds,"My resident gray and red squirrels have yet to figure out how to get food out of this (after a couple months). However, it is not a favorite with the birds either. I have the occasional titmouse, chickadee, cardinal eat from it but only once or twice a day. It is filled with black oil sunflower and spanish peanuts."
4,Great squirrel proof feeder,This is a great bird feeder if your look for a way to keep squirrels (and even deers!)away from your feeders. The only drawback (and it's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars) is it's weight and limit to the number of birds that have access to the seeds (usually only one bird at a time).
3,"Stops the squirrels, but the birds aren't crazy about it","We live in the woods and there are no shortage of tree rats around, so we were going through 20 lbs of feed every week or so feeding the squirrels. Tired of that I went in search of a reasonably priced feeder that would cut down our feed bills. Settled on this feeder after much research based on price, reviews and features.Pros:The squirrels quickly lost interest and moved onMetal construction seems solid and paint quality seems goodPost mount on T-post is solidHolds plenty of feedFeed bucket is easy to remove and reattach for fillingAlmost no waste from bird ""kicking"" seed out or water damageBird feed now lasts for monthsCons:Not prettyBirds aren't crazy about it. They liked the open feeders and tube feeders much better (so did the squirrels)Larger birds don't seem to use it even at the highest spring load setting (an extended perch would probably solve both issues)"
3,Test Jar,I ordered this product and I guess it was broken during shipping. The seller sent me a new one free of charge which I noticed a crack in during my first use. I am not happy at all with this product. However I am very happy with the way the seller tried and is still trying to help me take care of this issue. As for the seller I give five stars. As for the product I give one star. I am not sure that this would be a shipping issue since I have gotten two in a row that had the same types of cracks.
4,Works great.,"I needed a new tube for my hydrometer so picked up this guy. I like that the base unscrews for easy cleaning. It's much more durable than my last tube. However, it's rather wide (diameter). I used to have 2-3 ounces in my satellite fermenter; now I need at least 5 ounces."
3,Broke after one use,"This jar is bigger than it has to be for most hydrometers, so it wastes too much beer when making a test--not a huge amount, but enough. After I used it the first time, I rinsed it out and dropped the hydrometer in it. The impact knocked a hole in the bottom of the glass jar."
3,Not for high proof alcohol!,"I bought this test jar for taking readings of high proof alcohol. The plastic cracked after the first use. The plastic works well with low proof beer and wine, but isn't suitable for spirits and fuel grade alcohol."
1,Not suitable for high proof alcohol,I purchased this for proof testing high proof ethanol. The entire tube developed cracks after the second use. It apparently is not suitable for this use.
1,Is it suppsoed to be broke?,"The tube was cracked all around the base , and the first time I used it it snapped in half. The shipping was very secure, no way for it to move around in the box, so this had to have happened in warehouse. Severely disappointed, would not recommend."
3,Overpriced for its quality.,"If you are looking for an easy way to read your hydrometer, this would be a viable option. I will caution that this is plastic and it is prone to warping at the base which makes it wobbly. It's not a bad product as it works as advertised, but considering its construction, I don't think it is worth the $8 I paid for it."
5,test jar good,"Well the first one I recieved broke during its first use. It snapped at the base and the base was not flat and the whole thing wobbled. A quick e-mail to the seller resulted in a new one arriving within the week, free of charge and was of much better quality. I must have just gotten a defective one the first go round. Anyway, very satisfied with the seller and the product."
3,It' okey,Careful use is recommended. It is plastic and base is little narrow. Very light and easy to brake. If the base was wider and heavier it would be much better.
4,Very Well Made,"Bought this after breaking a glass one....this one is very sturdy, and very well made. Being plastic I don't have to worry about breaking this one either!"
1,Cheap Plastic Does Not Work For High Proof Alcohol,"This product is not good for high proof alcohol. I used it one time, washed it, and when I used it a second time it was cracked and leaking. The tube is made of plastic. If you are going to use it for proofing alcohol with a higher proof do not buy. Spend the extra dollars for glass."
3,Ok,"Item is a little bigger around than other test jars. Plastic is cheap and brittle. Overall OK, just doesn't look like the picture."
2,Was chipped on the top,"Item had a chip on the top of the clear tube. Otherwise it was OK. I can tell it was chipped before sending because there was no debris in the package. Not cool of the vendor to send bad item, but its still usable"
5,"The ""Bible"" of Discus Health","I have had this book since it was published and it is a complete guide to the health and well being of not only discus but other cichlids as well. If I have ever had a problem, a question or a need...this book has had the answer for me! It is, quite simply, the BEST there is...it is that simple."
3,Packed with info but not user friendly,"This book was obviousely written by an expert but it is really not useful as an everyday guide to keeping Discus healthly. There is a multitude of info on parasites, diseases, diagnosing with the use of a microscope. Huh? How many people in the aquarium hobby dissect their fish or own a microscope? The biggest oversight in this book is the lack of any quick diagnostic charts or clues of where to look for certain symptoms and what they mean. Even reading the book cover to cover did not answer all the questions that come up when a fish is sick. Descriptions of behaviors that indicate illness are buried in paragraphs or missing altogether. Discus Forum online is a much better resourse."
2,"Great story, Terrible art","I love almost everything Grant Morrison has done. And this was no exception. While he does an amazing job of giving the X-men a kick into modern times, the art almost hurts to look at. I've never been SO DISTRACTED by the poor quality of the art that I've wanted to stop reading a great story. It also doesn't help the fact the there are 3 different artists. I know that there was nothing that Grant could do about that, but I eventually just goes from bad, to worse."
4,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!,"WOW!!!!! I've been getting into X-Men lately after a very, very, very long time and this series is absolutely brilliant. Morrison has completely out done himself with some of the craziest and coolest situations the X-Men has ever encountered. Professor X's Sister is an amazing villain and truly evil. I would have given this book five stars for sure but some of the art is really, really, really, really terrible. Frank Quitely, Ethan Van Sciver, and Leinil Francis Yu all do an outstanding job. The images are truly amazing(especially Quitely) and completely compliment Morrison's tales but Igor Kordey and Tom Derenick are BAD!!!!!!! Their work was really hard to follow and most of their pages don't even look done to me. It seems as if they both had a gun pointed at their head and if they didn't finish the entire issue in 20 minutes they would die.Other then that this book is a must have for X-Men and Morrison fans!!!!"
4,"good, but inconsistent","I thought this was a pretty good story, the only thing I didn't like was how the artist changed from issue to issue. Not just for vol. 1 but almost all volumes. For me, the art has almost as much to do with the story as the writting. When new artists would step in it's almost as if I had to re-familiar myself with the characters. Still a good story, starts off strong and keeps you going."
3,New X-Men,"Overall, these books are very good, from Volume 1-6...The only thing that affect dramatically these books is the art, when It's drawm by Igor Kordey.For me, on a comic-book, the art is as important as the story and definitely, the decision of choosing Mr. Kordey for the art on Morrison stories was a disaster. Because Mr. Kordey's art obviously is not for these comic books. (His style probably applies to other kind of works, but for a comic-book, to me, is just horrible.)If you don't mind the art on these books, go ahead and buy them all because the stories are really good.But if you are like me, that I enjoy the art as well, I suggest you to take a look first before buying the volumes with Mr. Kordey's work.Jose Carlos VázquezMadrid, Spain"
2,Almost tolerable comic fare,"I got these three volumes of the Xmen by Morrison just to delve into a complete corpus of work. I realise that there are multiple versions of the Xmen and different writers will take it in subtly different directions. But this writer is no page turner.The first few issues setting up the Cassandra Nova character and situation were not bad. Even the sub-plot on identifying new mutants wasn't too bad. It went downhill from there. Every mutant was doing telekinesis on each other, mind-raping etc. Throwing in the Shiar Empire and lots of Imperial Guard is no different from any other mindless slugfest. The artwork was perfunctory and bad at times."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this portable CD & FM radio player for listening to classical music at work, and was quickly disappointed. There is quite substantial background hiss emitted through the headphones. This occurs even before the CD has started playing, and it exists regardless of volume. Trying to tune local FM stations was very problematic. With of dozens of regional stations I could only receive two with acceptable clarity, and most could not be found at all."
4,Dark Knight with all the trimmings.,"This is another one of mattel's repaints and hence Batman variations. But unlike several of the other figures, this one actually works for me. It shows Batman as a futuristic knight with a bunch of techno accessories. The color scheme also works great. One downside about the accessories, as with all mattel figures ther doesn't seem to be any instructions on how to place them on the figure save for the picture on the back of the box. And since, this one has by far the most accessories it gets a little confusing for kids (some adults also). All in all, the good outweighs the confusing therefore it's a good buy."
1,Too introductory. Not worth spending money for it,This is one of those books that content is way too introductory for any serious IT prfessionals that it is not even useful to be used as a reference for any real-world work we do. It is probably for those who wants to learn very basic of the product. Not worth spending money for.
3,Helpful,I agree with other reviewers. It doesn't come close to the usefulness of Step 1. It contains too little information considered high yield in the exam. Definitely not to be used by itself.
3,Quite a dissapointement compared to First Aid for Step I,"I agree with the first reviewer that this book was a dissapointment, but I disagree that there are better books out there. The USMLE step II review books are all terrible. They all fall in the shadow of First Aid for Step I and nothing can even come close to being as useful as that was. Again, this book had a lot to say about nothing. It's too basic to really be of use for the exam. The USMLE exams test a deep understanding of the material, and you'd better know the stuff in this book at the VERY LEAST. I'd still like a lot more detail."
2,not comprehensive,"This book has a lot of nice pictures, but it doesn't cover the bases. It touches on far too few topics to be a 'must have' book. I loved First Aid for Step 1, but this was a let down and a waste of money."
2,Disappointing. Nowhere near as good as First Aid Step 1,"Save your money and read something else. Although this review book is designed to be high yield, the information contained is TOO BASIC to be helpful. I learned almost nothing new from reading this book. The USMLE will test a deeper level of experience and knowledge than is contained in this book. Anyone who has had an adequate medical education will find the information in this book almost trivial. There are few decent Step 2 review books out there; this isn't one of them. BIG disappointment compared to First Aid for Step 1."
4,Nice Review,Nice quick review of VERY good information. Great to read a couple of days before the exam to help put it all together.
3,didnt help,"It is only good 4 step 1 . this isnt so high yield 4 me.there were better things, mayb they have upped their game now, but wont buy again"
3,not as good as the step 1 fa,another extra book I purchased when studying for the ck that i didnt really need or use. Doesnt compare to the step 1 fa.
3,Simply okay,"Its an okay book, it hasn't hit the sweet spot like First Aid Step 1 did. Still loyal to the brand though."
3,Good for cramming not to seriously study,"This book has all the information completely squashed-in. Altought it apparently has everything that one must know for the exam, it presents the information to packed or visually contaminating! This book is great for cramming not to seriously study what you haven't mastered in previous study years or even during the usual time alotted (weeks, months) to know the material prior to examination date. It has tough great mnemonics."
3,Not as good as Step 1 First Aid,"I think the style in general of Step 2 makes it more difficult to use a book in this format. I was EXTREMELY pleased with Step 1 first aid, so stuck with the series. This offers a decent outline to start out with, but leaves a little to be desired when it comes to more specifics required in CK. I would recommend it as an additional resource, but not the primary or sole study tool for step 2 ck."
1,Not yet ready for Kindle,"Don't get me wrong; I love the paperback, but I bought this for my kindle,and was sorely disappointed. The tables (that make up the majority of the book) were not properly formatted for the e-book, and the arrows used to signify increases and decreases show up as question marks instead, as the kindle's text does not recognize those icons."
2,There are better books out there.,"Though First Aid for Step 1 was a great book that helped a lot of medical students through the first two years and boards, this book just doesn't match up. The content is fairly flimsy and the information on the computerized exam is lacking."
3,good for review,"this is a good book to review the existing knowledge.... do not use this book to gain new knowledge.... excellent mnemonic help, thats good...i think this book need some more articles,,,,specially in paediatrics surgery and psychiatry...thank you"
2,"Not recommended to study, just a bathroom read.","I have not taken step 1 exam yet, but this book is not a good source. It contains too little information considered high yield in the exam. Definetly not to be used by itself. Good pictures to look at, but i definetly recommend another review book for the actual exam, while this one can be skimmed through."
4,It a good book,"I thought it helps out to sort through all the material, will not recomend this is your only book."
3,Could be better.,"This book comprises the pretty comprehensive chapters of Dermatology, Neurology and Statistics. Obg is okay there. Surgery amd IM are weak. However, It is still worth to be considered."
2,Giggled for a few days,"The best giggler type ball I've found so far has been at a Ross store in town. This ball is very durable, good for tough chewers but the giggle noise quit after the first day. Might as well spend your money on a regular ball."
3,It's ok,"This is a very durable dog ball. But it doesn't ""laugh"" consistently. It's pretty random and my dog was bored w it after 20 mins. For just a ball, it's great and will last! But, I searched for interactive dog toys and this came up. I will have to disagree with the interactive part."
1,Didn't Last Long,"This toy arrived last night with 3 other toys in the same delivery and was an instant favorite. Unfortunately, my Springer basically killed it within an hour of unpacking it. It didn't take him long to manage to pull the speaker out of the ball and it was just lucky I happened to notice him chewing something black (ball was yellow) and got it away from him before he could swallow any parts (I hope). So, although he had a lot of fun with it in the brief time he had it, I had to take the ball away. Not a good value for the short time it took him to kill it. Pretty disappointing for me -- he doesn't care, he had a great time while it lasted!"
1,dont buy this,"it does not giggle, it will make a little noise only when you shake it or drop it. maby i got a bad one????"
4,Very Funny,"Dogs were a little weirded out by the noises, but after awhile, started to have fun with it. Would recommend."
3,giggler ball,I like the concept of this dog toy...but it was bought for a miniature schnauzer and is too big for her to handle.
3,"Fun concept, but not practical","I got this thinking it would make lots of noises, but it really only makes one type of noise. You really have to shake the ball hard in order for it to make noise, so it's a toy you can shake to get your dog excited, but then when you set it down for them to play with it, it goes silent. If you're looking for a noisy toy to keep them entertained, this wouldn't be my choice.Pros:JW Toy (which are always innovative)very durableit's a ball (not sure what more I can say)Cons:it doesn't do much unless a person shakes itonly makes one noisenot super exciting"
3,No biggie,It's good because you can throw it but it doesn't make much noise. Other than that my girls have no interest in it.
3,tough ball,"This ball seems very durable. The sound it makes is like a kid's toy that goes zjhewww when you flip it over. Kind of a light saber sound! And the ball is hard rubber, it doesnt squish at all. My dog doesn't really like it, but it will last a long time!"
1,"Too big and sound is pathetic (does NOT ""giggle""!!)",This would have been a perfect product if they fix/improve the following:* The size should be smaller or they should at least offer a small size* The sound mechanism should be replaced by something electronic that DOES sound like giggles (or change the product name!)
3,"Good product, bad packaging","Item is genuine Hitachi staples. Product was received in a few days but there was minimal packaging and the staple box broke inside the cardboard box and I recieved 5000 staples, of which about 30 were broken, covering the bottom of the larger shipping box. They need to tape the Hitachi box, minimum. It's going back."
3,Recommendations not always as kid friendly as I had hoped,"I took my family to NYC and we had a great time. Our great time was not because of this book, but in spite of it. We had multiple occasions when a recommended restaurant was not very kid friendly, or a place to get dessert was just not that good. The guide did help with mapping out the main tourist sites we wanted to go to. Would look for another family guide to NYC if I was returning. There must be a better one."
3,Ok but some mistakes and not well organised,"The book is ok but I bought it because I was going to NYC and when I actually went I found that one restaurant, which was supposedly near my hotel, did not exist, another one was closed forever, so in the end I could not rely on the restaurant information. Also the information was put very sparsely, I would have arranged it more by area, given the fact that if you travel with kids the main problem is moving around and you are therefore more restricted in your movements. Overall it's 3 stars, I don't know if there are better guides, looking back I would not buy it again."
4,It is worthy!,I am satisfied with my travel guide purchase.We can feel it has been written by someone who really experienced NYC with kids. A lot of tips that can help a great deal.I hope not to get disappointed when I get to NYC.
2,A lot of wrong info.,"We recently planned a trip to NYC with our 6 and 1 year old. I picked up this book, seeing as we have never been to NYC. The hotel we chose out of this book was in a neighborhood I would not consider safe for children. We ended up changing hotels because of it. The book said there was a children's playroom in our new hotel...there was not. We went to the Children's Museum of Manhattan, which the book says is good for kids 8 and under...our 6 year old was bored!! Also, the museum does not allow strollers, which I think is important info that should have been mentioned, but was not. There were other little bits of info that the book mentioned that were incorrect.Needless to say, the book was packed away by the middle of the trip...it just wasn't reliable."
3,Not a Great Guidebook,"This book covers a lot of information, but lacks details on key traveller needs. The maps are very poor and the information on the subway system is not enough to help first-time users get where they are going. We always wished we had more information. The only way I would recommend this book is if it was used in conjunction with another guidebook."
1,CHUCK TEETH CRUMBLING AND BIT WON'T CENTER,I am having the same problem that others reported. The chuck will not keep the bit centered because the teeth are crumbling. Of all the things to go wrong with a drill I guess I am amazed that is the problem. HItachi really should be providing warranty support to fix this problem. Once again major companies get away with ridiculous customer service and there is no recourse for consumers.
4,corded handy drill,"It feels more than 3.1 pounds to me. I think because of the weight distribution of the drill. The tip of the drill is a lot heavier than the handle part. It would have been a lot better if the other way around were true.Craftsman has a 3.1 pound drill also, but much shorter; I like this one a lot better, but Sears sells it for $135.00, so I ended up buying this one.I am happy with it so far. Lots of power, 5 years warranty.Vu"
1,"Beware, absolute junk","I bought it in local Lowe's and replaced two already with the same problem. One or more chuck's teeth got broken inside and a bit can not be centered afterwords. Both times chuck failed at the very first job. I am just doing some work here and there around the house, not a pro contractor. Don't even think about buying one."
2,D10VH has defective keyless chuck,"Lowes has been discounting these for the last 8 weeks. The keyless chuck fails after about 1 hour of use. After returning the 1st one,I called Hitachi, They want you to ""bring it is for an evaluation"" Who has the time for this?"
3,Wish it had an electric brake,"I bought this over a year ago for use during deck construction. As some other reviewers have noted, the drill does tend to strip the screw when it cams out, due to the lack of an electric brake. This tool is great for drilling holes, and OK for putting in screws. Keyless chuck is a nice addition."
4,"Hitachi D10VH 3/8"" corded drill","This drill is strong and powerful enough for my purposes. The one problem with it is that it is too top heavy. This could be a problem if using it for any long length of time. Over all it's a good product for small home projects. I'll keep it, but in the future I will buy a new one from a brick and mortor store, where I can actually hold the drill before buying it."
2,Could be an OK 3rd or 4th drill,I bought this as a lightweight powerful complement to a cordless and an older Sears drill. It is OK for drilling but not for screws : the trigger is nearly all or nothing and usually strips heads ; in that regards the old Sears is way superior. The chuck works well but is a bit small for tightening by hand. Also the cord is too short and the usual lousy quality plastic - the trigger problems is such that I hesitate putting in the time to replace the cord with quality rubber.
4,Comfy and good to ease the arc,"I had extreme arc pain, had a hard time walking. I had the pain during the first few months when I moved here to NY, when you're not used to walking an average of 4-5 miles a day. I wore this Lumiscope Arch Easer complemented with a Dr Scholl's support underneath and they worked like a charm. Even without Dr Scholl's, this arch easer is great. It helped me recover from my pain and I still wear it every now and then when I know that I'll be doing long walks. This is also good when jogging. I recommend this product and it's worth the money."
3,very useful if you know how to use them,"I bought several of these... I used them for a while until my foot got better.Now, I only use them every once in a while, to bring my bottom tendon back in place.The big problem is that if you do not wrap a sticky bandage under it, it will slip to the front of the foot. It does not stay in place by itself.Prices can vary by 3 times... so wait until the price is reasonable... above $10 for a couple of simple elastic straps (there are two pieces in the box) its beyond my understanding."
2,Lumiscope Arch Easer Pair,I have a nerve problem in my foot and this product squeezed my foot and caused pain. Had it not been for the sensitive nerves in my foot I feel that it would be good support. It didn't work for me.
4,Heartwarming Journey,"With ""None But The Dead And Dying"" Ellen Behrens weaves and wonderful tale about the ongoings of a small village, and the wonderfully eccentric and well drawn characters that live there add a lovely touch. Often her words read like poetry, and her only drawback is a tendancy to over-emphasize a moment. The book is not incredibly long, and really, if you love tender, sweet and often humerous stories in the vein of something Nicholas Sparks might write, and as visually and emotionally stirring as ""The Bridges Of Madison County"" you have to give this a read. It's well worth the time and money, as I believe this is quite possibly a sadly overlooked and underestimated treasure."
3,How boring the brilliant can be,"I bought this book because I saw a chapter in which great classics of world- literature, the Bible, Homer, Quixote, Divine Comedy etc. are , as it were , critiqued by a reader at a publishing house who rejects them. I thought this might be interesting and amusing. There are some insights, but once one has the idea of the piece it is predictable and dull. Other pieces give the same kind of feeling. The Lolita parody in which the love- object is an old woman should have been confined to one- sentence.Perhaps I am not being fair to Eco, but the kind of humor through parody and pastiche which makes up this book simply does not much appeal to me.All of his great learning and knowledge seem to me here to be engaged in an exercise of 'playing with himself' which gives the reader little indeed."
4,Solid knife,"Pros: Knife is nicely balanced, the handle is comfortable and ergonomic, and it holds an edge very well.Cons: it is heavy, the handle has no texture so it is slippery when wet and the blade has no flex at all so it's not well suited for boning.It is a solid, pretty knife, but you can't do anything with it that you can't do with a $25 Victorinox Fibrox - and the Victorinox handle is much easier to grip when wet."
3,I Expected More than Just Watching Chris,"While I really love Chris' virtuosity, I was not entirely satisfied with what I received in this DVD. 75% of the DVD was just watching Chris when I was expecting to get a more educational lesson. Forgetful, but entertaining none the less. Good chops, Chris!"
2,Not for ours,"We got these thinking that our rabbit misty would love them, she did not. She gets more enjoyment from the cardboard cup holders."
1,As durable as my flabby butt!!,Got this remote yesterday. Was not hard to setup worked my tv vcr dvd and dvr. (Did not work my Roku Box) Unforchantly I am a couch deweller and a cluts. Well Long story short I dropped the remote last night when i fell asleep the two foot or less drop from the couch to the floor caused the remote to break. The housing on the back cacked and broke off remote still works but.... You get what you pay for!!
2,ok product,This product does not really do much during cravings. Plus the taste is terrible so its hard to take. I had hoped it would actually really help alot but it did not.
4,Well worth the money!!,My wife and I find this to be one of the best products for the money. It is well made and a great piece of equipment. It comes almost fully assembled. It is not light (because it is well made). The only bad feature is the way the cables are attached. For some exercies you don't need the handles and the cable is in an awkward place to unhook it. I would also reccommend it to be used where it does not have to be folded up to store away (especially by someone who is not in somewhat good shape. Its better if you can keep it open. I would definitly recommend it.
4,This Machine is Great!,"Does everything as advertised and more. My only complaint is a quality issue and this is why I have not given this Total Gym puechase five stars. During the first work out, one of the plastic wheels chipped and already looks that it may need replacing faily soon especially if it is used everyday, which it is. Also, the foam on the wings immediately started to tear away as I put my tennis shoes on there to exercise. Now only after a few weeks it's already almost worn down to the metal and I don't think I am that rough with it! Other than that, it's terrific. I would definitely buy again."
4,Really good workout,"Having little space and time for exercise, I am very happy with my Total Gym 1500. The manual is clear and easy to understand; set up is a bit awkward but with practice it is getting easier. Storing it under the bed takes less than 2 minutes - again, awkward to do at first but getting better. The different height adjustments make for a good range of resistance."
1,WORTHLESS,The Total Gym is worthless. You might as well do push-ups since you are only balancing or lifting your own body weight. You can do everything this tool does by laying on the floor working your body or standing up twisting on your own. SAVE YOUR MONEY. This gadget is a rippoff!
4,Good piece!,"I really appreciated the fact that it was already set up. It is very durable and stable enough for me, who is 5'11"" and weighs about 205. There are some really nice exercises to do on this machine. It is extremely good for the shoulders, back and triceps, but somewhat limited in other areas. The handle and rope attachment get in the way when doing chest exercises, and arm curls. Some of the exercises are too easy and don't really work the muscles enough. I use it strictly for shoulders and triceps, a little for chest, and do the rest of my workout on a bowflex. It is nice and worth the price compared to other workout machines, but tough to get a complete good workout on. I do recommend the machine and am happy with it, and consider it a good buy."
3,"Great machine, difficult to adjust!","The problems started from the beginning. It was very hard to even get this machine in the position to start working out. It is very hard to adjust the machine to different levels. The glide board is always coming off the railing and there are more then enough attachments. I find myself not doing the leg exercises because it is just so frustrating to even connect the leg attachments. The machine also does not move easily to store. However, when you get used to it, the machine itself gives a great exercise."
3,Not for heavy bags...,"This is more related to the overall combination of the rack and the side-frame for beam racks. If you carry close to the 20lb limit or if you don't have both sides equally balanced, unless you are doing mild riding with no standing while climbing hills, the rack will move. I have had to shift back to my normal rack for my daily commute with laptop in tow..."
3,Seems to work well so far BUT....,"...BUT my inner thigh rubs against the seat-post-clamp part of the rack which is VERY annoying. Hard to believe no one experienced this during testing... wait, maybe they barely tested it. Lame."
1,Unclear,I am disappointed to realize I need to purchase the main rack as these are just the side frames that attach to the main frame that you need to purchase seperately. Not clearly stated in the description. The gray of the side frame blends with the rest of the picture misleading the purchaser to think it is one piece.
1,Not exactly what you expect,"I bought this thing thinking I could remove it when ever I wanted. So if i wanted to go on a long ride, and I didn't want to transport anything, I would be unencumbered. However, this is not the case. If you put anything over 5 lbs on the rack then it will move around and really mess up your ride.So to compensate for the swaying you have to screw it on so tight that you have to use tools to remove it. This works a little, but doesn't completely stop it from moving if you got more than 10 lbs on it. So now i am stuck with this thing and since I bought the bag that clips onto it I am forced to buy a stationary rack.They system is a great idea, but I think the Topeak MTX BeamRack needs more refining. I recommend just getting a topeak stationary rack with the MTX bag system."
5,Great Rack!,"Quick to intall and provides correct position for my Fuji Crosstown with 21"" frame. Bag does not sit above top of seat and hit my butt."
4,Good buy,"So far so good. Works well with other topeak accessories. i ride a road bike to work, about 15 miles. Little sway, lock to seat well. So far its a smart purchase. Quick release rubs leg just a little."
2,Looks nice but....,"A great idea but lacks refinement. This rack is ideal if you live in a low crime area and don't hall much very often. I don't hall much but this rack screams take me. I would have loved to see a bolt on connection at least that would make the thief do some work. If you can get it tight enough to your post this rack will work well. I felt the quick release is wasted because I want the rack on most of the time. Good: functions well, and looks nice. Bad: Price a bit high for this price you could get a more sturdy 4 point connection rack, hard to get the perfect fit, easily stolen."
4,Very handy,Great rack system. But it does move around a bit if you cannot lock it tight enough. It will usually only move when I have the frame and pannier pack on.
2,Mediocre at best,"While this rack looks good, and appears well constructed, it's mounting system leaves something to be desired. While attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around, I managed to bend the locking lever. Now don't get me wrong, this is mounted on my wife's bike (a cruiser) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on. But having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying. I suppose I will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation. By the way, I have a Delta rear rack on my ATB that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp. Much sturdier, and it was much less expensive, as well."
2,Quick release clamp may cause you problems,"This is a very high quality rack that is fairly light weight and is definitely not cheaply made. My problem is with the quick release clamp. It makes the product unusable, for me. The clamp is so large that my inner thighs rub the clamp as I ride, which is very annoying. As another reviewer stated, this would be the perfect rack if Topeak ditched the QR clamp and instead just went with a clamp that bolted onto the seat post. I really hate to return this rack, but I just can't ride with it."
4,Good Beam Rack,"Great high quality construction. Light yet strong. I use it to carry a full DXP trunk bag (i don't fold out the paniers). It solved the problem of not having a place to hook up a panier rack to my road bike- no connection points. Great thing about it is that you can take it off easily for weekend rides. Although not recommended, i use it on my carbon fiber seat post with no issues. Just be careful and get the right version. The selection of a downward, straight or upward angle version depends on the size of your bike and setup. Biggest thing to watch out for is that the CLAMP MIGHT RUB THE INNER THIGHS! Check the location in relation to the saddle. If your saddle if offset quite far back off the seat post (i.e. a lower more streamlined position) the clamp will touch your inner thigh when your leg is fully extended (particularly on the right hand side)."
5,First pneumatic nailer- success!,"I usually do my homework before a purchase this being no exception. This Hitachi is esay to use, light weight, versatile- it shoots from 1 1/4 to 2 1/2 inch nails. I was able to find the nails at both Lowes and Home Depot.I was way up on a ladder installing specialty moulding and also doing baseboard at ground level. I have been doing it for years with finishing nails and a nail punch- afraid I am now hooked on these pneumatic air nailers- about time :)Chuck Berschinski - Mahomet, Il."
5,AWESOME,"I use this gun for DIY projects since 2007. Probably the most useful application was installation of 400 ft sq of red oak flooring (3/4"" thick). The depth control excelled for this task. The flooring stapler cant reach close to walls or in tight spots so the Hitachi finish nailer was used to either face nail (were space was cramped) or angle nail through the tongue at 45 degrees. This is a powerful gun that can deeply counter sink nails in every situation I encountered (especially the 45 degree nailing in the tongue). Tough, powerful, and flawless performance."
5,Great nailer,Bought Hitachi based on reviews and it has lived up to the hype. Over 2000 nails in the first 2 days and not one problem. If I ever run into any sort of problem I'll update but it seems unlikely; there isn't one thing about this nailer to pick at.I would like to add that I really like the case as well. I think all nailers should come with a case.
5,Stop searching. This is the gun you want.,"I bought two of these nailers a few years ago and could not be more impressed. They are flawless performers and incredibly reliable. The only repair job I've needed was after one fell from a 12 foot ladder onto a concrete slab and cracked the plastic sliding nail-feeder piece.One of them was stolen recently and I did not hesitate to buy an identical gun to replace it, they are just that reliable. They have been dropped, dragged, used as ""persuaders"" to tap moldings into place, plus they've fired countless thousands of nails, I've hit many screwheads/metal straps/nail guards/etc, but they have yet to misfire a shot.Not one misfire or malfunction in over 3 years of hard use! They have plenty of power, an easily adjustable depth setting dial, and the built-in blower has come in handy more times than I can count."
5,A great product.,This nailer performs as it should day in and day out. Very reliable and excellent in overall quality. Would recommend highly to anyone.
4,good tool--bad customer service,excellent tool--but no free shipping as advertised--but bought the tool anyway! don't know if this is indicative of amazon policy--used car salesmen!
4,Good gun w/ lots of power - I'd buy it again,"Bought this as a second finish gun as my 10-year old Senco SFN40 was losing power (seems to be an issue with oil-less guns). The Hitachi has the power to sink 2 1/2"" nails in the hardest wood - in fact, in softer wood you cannot always dial it back enough so that the nail heads are flush. I cannot remember this gun ever jamming, where the Senco would jam occasionally near the end of a clip. The Hitachi is louder than the Senco, but it does more work! The rubber nose piece leaves marks that don't come off (but there is a storage boss for it on the magazine). As mentioned in other reviews, the adjustable exhaust and blower are nice features, as is the switch for bump firing vs. single firing (although I doubt many people bump-fire a finish gun). This would be the perfect gun if: it were quieter; the rubber nose didn't mark; and it had the lockout feature to prevent blank firing when you're out of nails."
5,great nailer,"I love this thing!! I have pushed through at least 1000 nails without a hitch. There are three nailing modes, but the single shot trigger mode allows precise alignment without having to worry about the nailer going off on you. Having to include an oil lubricator in the line is kind of a pain, but not too much. The unit also has a button for blowing air through it to allow you to clear the work area of debris, and I have accidentally pushed it a few times and it scared the bejesus out of me, but it is very useful. You get used to it."
5,cs3,CS3 is a vast improvement over CS2. Bridge alone is worth the price.What would a digital photographer do without Photoshop?
1,wait until Adobe fixes installation complaints,"Do NOT get this program YET. There are numerous issues with the installation process which Adobe has yet to address. I am not alone with serious installation issues. The Internet is full of complaints about aborted installation of all Adobe CS3 products. Some people need to do a complete reinstall of their XP operating system (after a hard drive reformat) just to install the latest Adobe products. Others have had to uninstall all of their Adobe products just to install the trial version of Photoshop CS3. Adobe does offer one fix, but before you use it they warn you that use of their script coult result in erasing of your entire hard drive. Adobe has really screwed up with the new product line. Beware!!!!!!!"
4,"Good upgrade, still photoshop","Photoshop CS3 is an awesome program. Is it a worthwhile upgrade from CS2? No. From CS and lower, most definately. I haven't really taken advantage of CS3's new features as of yet with acception of the new camera raw, I'm just set in my ways. I haven't experienced any bugs as of yet, the program starts up super fast and installation was problem free. I did install it on a vista machine so that could be why. I really love the new interface, it took some getting used to, but I love how its the same throughout adobe's applications (except dreamweaver). All in all, CS3 doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just adds little things to make your workflow a bit more streamlined."
3,CS3 Upgrade Review (Windows Vista),"A good upgrade if it weren't for the unforgettable ""printer driver"" bug under Vista.Unless you want to suffer from horribly slow performance, you will need to install a ""default printer"" driver (there are links to more info on this in the Adobe support forums).Why Adobe has not made a patch available for this is hard to understand.Until they do, I cannot give more than three stars to this, otherwise fine, upgrade."
1,Don't upgrade to CS3,I moved up from Elements to Photoshop CS2 a couple of years ago and was very pleased. I saw all the hype about all the new features in CS3 and bought the upgrade. Huge mistake. There is a major problem with printing on window computers. I uninstalled CS3 and went back to CS2 . Google CS3 printing problems and you'll find all sorts of info. Adobe is aware of the problem and says they are going to fix it. They don't say when. I would recommend not buying this upgrade until they have fixed the printing problem
4,Photoshop CS3,"As a prior user of PCS2 find the new products improvements to be very useful, and have help me to improve my work flow greatly."
1,BEWARE,"Although I recieved my money back from the seller it was a fraudulent copy...I then purchased a ""real"" version and love it. I ordered it through[..]. They were the only place left that I found sold ligit copies of the older version. Just be careful. Adobe says they recieve several calls a day about ""fake"" copies..."
3,Not clear,It was not clear to me from the ads that Adobe will not allow individual parts of their suites to be upgraded like Microsoft office does. CS2 would not allow me to upgrade just the Photoshop portion of CS2 Design Premium so I had to purchase the entire suite package and sell off what I bought for Photoshop alone.
3,"Ok, But Just That","It is an Upgrade, and to keep current would be the only reason to purchase it. Now that CS4 is out, why bother?"
3,Konked out after 6 months,"My husband loved this grinder-quick, one-handed use and he dug the light. But it was a pain to fill, held only about a week of pepper and then died in about 6 months. I am going to try another brand for less money. I didn't expect it to last forever but I can buy another brand for half the cost."
2,Disappointing,"This is an OK book, but could have been better. There are few actual stories. A lot of good information and background on Pele and the volcanoes of Hawaii written in a forgettable style. The art is not so great, either. The Ancient Hawaii book by the same author is much better over all."
4,great product (Wix) @ a great price,"Wix still makes a decent product so it's never worth going to a cheaper brand. Besides the quality, the pricing here is aggressive (lower than many other retailers)"
4,todos mis exitos VHS,"This video is pretty cool. Actually, it's really cool. The only thing that sucks is the picture. It looks like a copy made in someone's house. The sound quality is decent but no surround sound exists."
1,I know why he's not that into you.....,LAME!!!!!!!!! Even with a good collection of stars for the cast this movie was boring!!! I'm just glad that I didn't spend the money at the theater to see it....
2,I'm Just Not That into This Movie,"I wondered how movie makers would turn a relationship guide into a successful hit movie...and I never found out...because this movie was lacking. I'm just not that into it. A couple of years ago, I bought Greg Behrendt's book (""He's Just Not That into You"") and absolutely LOVED it! It offered good advice and was funny as well.Unfortunately, none of that transferred to the big screen. Everybody got the story line; so, it became boring watching so many of the same examples of women simply not understanding when a man is just not that into them. When a person doesn't (1) call, (2) return calls, (3) act interested, 4) make time to see you, etc., it's because he/she is not interested. Period.After a while, the movie seemed to drag on endlessly. So, as much as I loved the book, I did not enjoy the movie enough to buy the DVD. I may watch it when it comes on cable...unless I have laundry to do. LOL!"
3,It surprised me...,"I watched this movie almost reluctantly. I actually ended up enjoying it a lot more than I expected. Nicely-done and believable performances from the whole cast, particularly Jennifer Connolly and Jennifer Aniston. Without giving too much away, I'll say that a couple of scenes with Aniston actually got me a little misty-eyed... but then again, I've been known to cry at life insurance commercials. The thing that nearly spoiled this movie for me was the fact that the main ""playa"" guy in the movie ends up falling in love with the clueless, grasping, hopelessly romantic girl. We all know that smooth guys never go for that girl. The clingy girl will ALWAYS be left high and dry and wondering ""What the F just happened?"" when Mr. Wonderful turns into Mr. Emotionally Unavailable and fades away after a couple of dates, or after she sleeps with him.Ah well, may be this unlikely happy ending will appeal to you hopeless romantics out there. If so, ""knock yourself out."""
5,great chick flick,Its a great chick flick. i wouldn't recomend for a guy but great girls night out movieits cute
2,Disappointing,"This is not a chick flick. It is not much of a romantic comedy, either, since it's not very romantic and it's certainly not very funny. It is more excrutiating than anything else, and also not very believable. I disliked almost all of the characters, with the exception of Jennifer Aniston's. I could not believe how virtually all the women were portrayed as gullible, stupid, pathetically yearning for a guy, and, in Jennifer Connelly's case, irritatingly whiny and nagging. And the men, of course, were equally unattractive--lying, philandering, acting like complete boors and slobs. What a delightful movie. Skip it."
4,"Sweet, Fun, and Charming with modern romantic reality!","I loved this movie the second time I viewed it! The first time I thought it was going to be a hilarious laugh out loud comedy which gave me a wrong impression of what the movie was really like. There are funny parts, but there is also plenty of real modern romantic reality- drama.This movie has great cast including Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston, and Ben Affleck, and a great plot that make this a romantic film to be seen by both women and men. This movie is about modern day relationships which include endless use of modern technology, clueless men and clingy women. Not only is this film enjoyable, but there is alot to be learned about the dos and donts in love and relationships. This film has it all! If you love a great chick flick and you want to laugh and cry, this movie is definitely worth your time!"
5,lots of fun,"If you want a fun movie to watch with the girls this is the one! It is brutal, sweet and romantic all in one !"
5,Great romantic comedy with a good variety of stories -,"Definitely worth watching - good fare for a Friday night and a glass of wine. Some well-realized characters and tight writing. Wish we had seen a little more of the Ben A./Jennifer A. characters and their back story, but it wasn't necessary to the story. Need to go research what else this director has done!"
5,cute movie,"I'll watch anything Jennifer Aniston is in. One of my favorite actresses, but the entire movie was great. Several different storylines intertwined. I would recommend the movie."
4,Good RomCom,I'm a sucker for romantic comedies - this one has the romantic comedy draw and the drama aspect. Star-studded cast. Good for a girl's night in.
2,NOT WORTH IT!!,"What the hell is Jennifer Conelly doing in this movie, her great acting skills are put to rest in this piece of junk. The only decent acting was done by Ginifer Goodwin. I actually felt sorry for her character, the girl was so desperate and pathetic to get a guy to like her. I wasted my time and money renting this movie, it only proves to me how further downhill Hollywood has gone."
2,I'm just not that into this movie.,"Watched it once. Wanted my hour and a half back. Watched it a second time. Hated myself for my stupidity. You might laugh a little bit, but really it's just an annoying girl, a crappy guy, and a cute story about a couple that end up transcending social mores and agree to just love each other once the woman stops worrying about tradition too much. Oh but wait, the guy eventually caves. Nevermind, nothing redeeming about this movie."
2,PG-13--I don't think so!,"This movie is currently on my 17-year-old daughter's top 5 list and she begged me to watch it with her the other day. I would like to say first of all that I am not a prude...however, I was appalled that this movie was rated PG-13 as I would have died a slow death had I watched it with her when she was 5 years younger. The language (the F word is used more than once along with other ""colorful metaphors""), the fairly graphic office sex scene with two of the characters, the one character saying how she'd like to ""dry hump"" one of the male characters, partial nudity, etc., make this movie totally inappropriate for anyone under 17 and should have been rated R. In addition, it's boring and I had to fight to stay awake."
5,Classic Movie,Great film - cool extras and deleted scenes. Highly recommend - not your average check flick AT ALL.
1,Not worth buying,"It is not worth buying but it is worth seeing once and only once. But seriously, don't pay to buy it."
3,A light-hearted time,"This is a light-hearted movie about five women and four men, who try to sort out the signals that the sexes exchange. These kinds of topics - ""What do men and women really want"", will always do fine with the romantic comedy crowd. Although not really my kind of movie, I appreciated it and liked the story, the cast and direction.Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein wrote the charming screenplay, which was based on the book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo.Ken Kwapis directed with a sure hand."
1,Really Disappointing,"I bought this movie without having seen it, on the strength of the cast and a general descriptive sense of the premise. Generally speaking, I enjoy Jennifer Aniston movies. Unfortunately, this is a movie which looks like it was knocked out because, hey, with a cast like this, how can it not make money? It's a real stinker, folks. BOOOOOORING!"
3,"Funny, better then I expected!",Watched with my 16 year old son and 18 year old daughter. We enjoyed it! Too true sometimes!
2,In a word: boring,"Given the cast (apart from Ben Affleck), I was very hopeful for this film. Alas, it was mediocre at best. I was disinterested to the point of actually turning it off with probably 10min to go. It was, in a word, boring. And setting aside the numerous clichés about love and relationships in the digital age, the plotlines and chemistry between characters were dismal. (Ben Allfeck as good guy? Sorry, but he can't pull that off).This was a struggle to watch. The actors were obviously not at their best (e.g., Scarlett's scene at Handy Mart where she wins an ice box). Boring boring boring."
4,"If you loved this movie, you will want to own it!",Fun movie to just enjoy over and over again without having to THINK alot. Sometimes you just need a fun movie on those rainy days/nights or just when you need a break. Great casting and fun storyline.
5,So fun,"A terrific movie; great cast of characters, funny plot...and not altogether unhelpful if you are in the midst of the dating circuit, ladies..."
4,Fun Chick Flick,"As a fan of chick flicks, I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of good actors, and fun punch lines, and some cute guys to boot."
5,Love this movie,This is one of my favorite movies and is like new. I love how it had not one scratch on it.
1,Just Don't Rent It,"Ok, any femanist who watches this movie would rather scratch their eyes out then watch this movie. Women begging for dates, suspecting their husbands of making bad choices or settling for guys who won't commit.....what an exciting concept for a movie. Ahh, I think NOT! I am shocked so many high profile actors agreed to take these characters on. I was completely disappointed by this movie. It wasn't worth the $3.99 I paid for the rental."
2,Dreary,"Could it be that men don't enjoy saying no anymore than we enjoy hearing it? Or perhaps the idea was that insanely good looking people have the same difficulties you and I have. Sure. If Ben Affleck had ended up with Drew Barrymore, we might have the makings of an interesting story. But to see this guy, who is like the male Sharon Tate, begging someone to take him back and to marry him was a bit much. By contrast, the Scarlet Johannsen ""why can't we just be friends"" story seemed about right but so sad, typical and well, just a drag."
1,What a shame.,"What a shame. The book was *so* informative and got me through some of the worst breakups imaginable. This movie had everything going for it- big budget, glossy cast, and a great idea. But it was executed extremely poorly and ended up being a lie. This is supposed to be about the reality and the harshness of relationships, and it isn't. It's just another romantic comedy that doesn't seem to have any underlying message to the audience. And I couldn't stand the characters, especially Scarlett Johansson, who I usually can't get enough of. I didn't relate to this film at all. Bottom line, get the book, ignore the movie."
1,He's Just Not That Into You,"He's Just Not That Into You is the latest in a long line of romantic comedies that attempt to navigate the complexities of modern relationships. The movie's problem, is that by juggling so many plot threads it ends up giving a short shrift to characterization and insight. An embarrassment of talented actors play Baltimore residents who are attempting to find the perfect match, but are regularly stymied by self-questioning and unreturned phone calls. The film is bogged down by the fact that there's too much going on for the characters to emerge as three-dimensional personalities, thus reducing its talented thespians to playing stereotypes."
2,Surely I was not the target audience.,"Ever since I was a child, my parents have always watched movies & series I've hated & never given me a say oe downvoted me on what we'd watch, even as an adult today. So as I was eating dinner with my parents today, I was basically forced to watch this.There are too many characters & all of the women have (to me) the same personality, but with different needs & wants. Characters range from ""desperate clueless naive whore"" to ""paranoid naive henpecker with mixed up priorities."" I don't actually know any women who ever felt like a man was a mandatory necessity in life, nor do I know any women this ""girly,"" so these women are strange & unrealistic to me.I will give it points for the ending though; it's not really fairytale-romance-contrived & some of the women decide they want to be alone."
3,Just not that into it,Just ok for me. It was somewhat entertaining but I am glad I didn't pay big bucks to see it in the theater.
2,JUST NOT INTO IT,I didnt enjoy this movie even alittle in fact i turned it off half way threw wasted my money and my time i would rather watch paint dry i thought since it had a good cast movie would be awesome dont let that fool u
3,RINGS TRUE,"THIS MOVIE, THOUGH A BIT CONTRIVED, RINGS TRUE. HOWEVER, THIS SAID,WITH JUST A STELLAR CAST, IT'S DISAPPOINTING."
3,a little too expected,"i liked the book better, here the girls get the guy at the end, and the book is more about how we read all the signals wrong..."
3,ok,"an ok chick flick movie, Good Cast, Hollywood Model of Falling in Love, Couldn't watch it the second time :P"
3,Just Not That Into You,"I'm a HUGE fan of films with multiple plot lines and stories.All were well acted, but its not entirely satisfying.Definitely a few honest and cute moments that make it worth seeing."
2,I just couldn't get into this...movie,"Very slow moving, had its high points, but overall a movie I'd not recommend to anyone over 18 years old."
3,An easy to watch female-centric film,"An easy to digest film that tries to over simplify the complications of dating. However, it's not offensive or stupid, a nice watch for a Sunday afternoon."
2,confusing movie,this movie was confusing. too many different people. it was really boring too.i wouldn't recommend it to anyone really.
3,Okay,"This is one of those stories that just isn't all that memorable. It's the same old same old, as far as the plot goes. Not bad, but not great, either."
1,Just not that good....,"This movie was pretty boring and not funny. Not to mention it really portrays women as being very desperate and stupid, and men as dogs. The ending was alright but pretty predictable. Great cast, but not worth watching...."
5,One of my fav movies !,"Ladies, this is a great choice. It's a fun movie. Watch it !! I have seen it so many times."
4,Very good movie!,"Wasn't really expecting too much from this movie, but I found it to be very good. The characters were likable and the situations were very true to life."
4,Own to Watch Again & Again,"Very cute romantic comedy. I wanted to own this DVD, rather than rent it, so that my teenage daughters and I can watch it again and again. Great for ""Chick Flick Night""!"
3,"Typical, pleasant chick flick","Reminding me of the American version of ""Love, Actually"", this film is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It is a montage of a number of well-known, good actors playing out romantic entanglements that don't even begin to challenge their talent. But never mind that - it's a sweet little film."
3,"SHOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS MOVIE, NOT A FAN OF CHEATERS! SCARLOTTE JOHANSSEN'S CHARACTER WAS A REAL SLUT!","However, I did appreciate Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck and Ginnifer Goodwin's performance. Which is the real reason I purchased the movie. However, Jennifer Connolly was a damn wreck! SAVE YOUR MONEY! GET THE CLIPS YOU NEED/WANT ON YOUTUBE!"
1,Disgusting & Pathetic Waste of Film (not even worthy of a star),"I sat there with my wife trying to find some redeeming value to this flick, but there was none. If you want agendas, this one is full of em'. I am embarassed to have wasted $3.99 on this moral-less movie. So much for a good romantic comedy. Don't be fooled by the preview, there is nothing but all kinds of rhetoric in this pathetic film. Disgusted."
1,flop,Just really cheesy lackluster movie. I could hear these ideas from people on the street. Not impressed with the acting or the direction of the movie. Expected more. Husband fell asleep after first ten minutes. I did not watch 'til end.
4,Nice ensemble romance,I enjoyed watching this ensemble romantic comedy. I liked the way it was put together with the question/answer parts as well. I would have enjoyed seeing an older couple in it as well.
4,Really Funny Movie,Really Funny Movie. I love how the characters evolve throughout the movie and seeing the true comedy that comes from it.
1,"tedious, predictable, too long","Half way through I really wished it was over already. Misanthropic, misogynistic and generally dull, dull, dull."
2,Missable,"I wasn't drawn to this movie by its own charms, I just wanted to see how they translated the advice book to the screen. Given that one of the book's central theses is that life is not a rom-com, my expectations were fairly low.It's a competent effort, but for me the casting was a bit dull, the writing fell short, and I wasn't engaged by any of the relationships explored. It felt like a quick knock-off of ""Love Actually""."
4,Funny Movie,"""He's Just Not That Into You""; is a movie about communication. It sounds simple, but the movie is funny and hits the nail on the head. It has many actors that are intertwined by work, family or friends.I found this film as entertaining and funny. I did not see awards, but something to laugh at."
3,"EXCELLENT CAST IN THIS BETTER THAN AVERAGE ""CHICK FLICK""! 3 1/2 STARS!","One of the longest predictable ""chick flicks"" I have ever seen, 'He's Just Not That Into You' is pretty easy to watch because of a great cast. Even though you know where it's going, the ride is entertaining. It's not nearly as cleaver as it thinks it is, but it doesn't feel as long as its two hour running length either. I'm sure this will appeal to women more than men(duh!), but with a cast that includes Scarlet Johansson, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck,Jennifer Connelly and many more, this film is hard to dislike."
5,A Mighty Challenge To Men,"Sam Laing writes a timely challenge to men to rise up and be men of God. He takes his text from 1 Chronicles 24 where David numbers his mighty men. Laing builds off each of the mighty men to show biblically how men should live lives of purity, honesty, integrity, holiness, and committment to Jesus as their Lord.While I am not part of the International Churches of Christ, I found Laing's book to be doctrinally sound (Titus 2:1) and not focused on any one group. Laing's heart is for true disciples (Luke 14:25-35) and Laing has been part of the reformation taking place within the International Churches of Christ. The book does not teach mind control of any kind nor does Laing push for his readers to join ICC churches."
3,I liked the first one better,"This was my second Sisterchicks book, and after finishing it I can definitely say the first one is alot better. I really cannot pin point why I was not as intrigued with this story as I was the first one. Maybe as one reviewer said, it was just too perfect.I think it started slow, but it did pick up toward the middle. What I found to be the most interesting was all the information on Hawaiian history and words.Perhaps, I was looking for something that would take me in my mind to the islands, and I personally did not feel that. I saw that one reviewer actually listened on CD to this book, and maybe that would have helped my imagination.All in all, I cannot say that I dont totally recommend this book, but I do think the first one was much better. I am currently reading the third in the series and cannot wait to review it because it has a great start so far."
1,a sisterchick letdown,"I was really disappointed with this book. It was syrup-y sweet and too perfect, as another review said. I was really looking forward to reading this one after finishing the first one, which was GREAT. I hope Sisterchicks in Mexico is better!"
5,A Classic Robin Gunn story,Robin Jones Gunn has done it again! Her works continue to keep me alive and i love the plot of this new story in Hawaii. Robin is such a talented author and i loved this book and cannot wait till the next one!
4,Fairly good,"This was a fun, easy read. I thought several scenes were set up for a funny, wacky, mishap, and then nothing happened, so that was kind of a let down. It was set-up as Lucy and Ethel, but those scenes didn't really deliver.Overall, really liked it. I love Robin's other works, though so I figured I'd like this. One thing I do have a big problem with is her using The Message and calling it a version. It is not a version of the Bible - it is one man's paraphrase. A version (usually) goes back to the original languages, and always has a huge group of translators checking and double checking and triple checking the work. The Message is not a version, it is a paraphrase, and should be treated as such."
5,A must-have for every teacher and parent,"As a teacher and parent I found this book invaluable. It should be given to each teacher upon graduation.It is helpful to parents too. This book is witty, easy to read and full of common sense advice on how to achieve the desired results in any situation (except potty training, which this book does not address). The most valuable element to this book is it teaches the adult how to achieve positive results while building up the child's self-esteem. It teaches the adult how to create a consistant, positive, loving environment that children naturally thrive in. With a few consistant steps on the adult's part, the children and the adult will gain peace within their environment and it teaches adults how to respect children without caving into them. I teach 2 1/2 - 6 year olds, mainstream to mildly special needs children and the stratagies in this book work beautifully."
4,Finally....the NCV on CD!,"I liked the narration of the NCV Bible New Testament, and the stories were also memorable. This is a great idea, such a great idea that I thought to myself, ""Why don't they have the COMPLETE NCV Bible on CD for EVERYONE, not just the ladies?"". Thomas Nelson Publishers....that was for you.....(ahem...ahem)!!I love hearing the Bible on audio, and I think the HEARING of it is just as compelling and memorable as READING the Word on a page. Another great audio Bible!"
3,"Not the Airborne With Jack Black, Shane McDermott, and Seth Green",For those who were looking for the movie Airborne with the previously listed people...I took a chance on this one and ordered it as I was looking for it too. Nope this is not it.Hope this helps!
3,O K ......,I saw the movie and it was okay but it could have been better. The plot is Guttenburg is in a special forces type group and his team is tring to find a stolen disease. It's a good movie to watch once or twice!
3,Virtual Skipper 3,The game is ok but it came without any instructions for using the game and what controls are needed on my keyboard to use the game.
1,"I played it twice, then got board","I bought this game because I loved virtual skipper 1. I have not taken anywhere near the enjoyment out of this game. I have a fast computer with a gig of ram and still have performance issues with the graphics.The thing that makes me the angriest about this game is the disk copy protection. It starts up and goes into a disk protection check. This security feature means it takes the game 5 min+ to start up. By the time that it finally starts up I have normally found something more interesting to do with my time.Finally, I question the rules they use and the very little feedback I have gotten from penalties. I have been involved in collisions when the starboard tack boat has gotten a penalty. I don't know what is up with that.Anyhow, I don't play this game much. I still do play virtual skipper 1. I hope this helps someone else not to feel ripped off."
3,Learn how to sail without going through much of the work!,"This game is a great on value and good otherwise. The graphics paint quickly and the realism of the experience - changing sails, direction, etc - really can teach you some of the basics of sailing without actually being out on the open water. Overall, a good game."
1,"Graphics are misleading, simulation is so so","This wasn't as great as the reviews lead you to believe. The games graphics bog down my 2.8Ghz processor with 512Mb, so I have to run it on low graphics settings to get a smooth game. I have played virtual sailor 2 for over a year now and it is better.I think that this software has potentials, but wait until they clean up the main menu. Download the demo and you'll see what I mean.Until then just stick with virtual sailor 2.Version 3 is no big upgrade."
1,Does not work in Windows 7,"I didn't want to spend 50 dollars for the up-to-date version of this game, Virtual Skipper 5. So I ordered this $5 disc of an old version. I cannot make it work on windows 7. Save your money!"
1,Very thin and cheaply made,After ordering these and using them to ship i realized just how cheaply they are made. I had to double bag several orders i shipped to keep them secure. I would not recommend these particular bags. I have ordered others and the inside lining is very thick and no see through. You can see through this batch i received. Hopefully the next ones i order will have the silver linig. thank you
2,"Poor quality, Received returned item?","We were pretty excited to get this bed for our almost 2 year old son. I was disappointed to find it was pretty scuffed on a few edges with surface scratches throughout, and a 3 inch puncture wound on the inner car. After ordering (Amazon almost ALWAYS has the lowest price therefore shopping around is rarely needed) I was also extremely sad to find this bed on Little Tikes website for $100 less, $249. Now although the bed was previously damaged, it shipped freight and there is NO way I'm going to try and send it back. If those hindrances hadn't happened, I was still a little disappointed by the quality of the plastic, once a bolt ripped right through the plastic while tightening. I bought a twin mattress and there are 3 inch gaps on 3 sides of the bed, so it does not fit like in the product picture, but my son still loves it despite all these flaws, so I guess that's all that matters."
4,great bed!,my kids love their beds i have got this blue one for my 15 month old son and a pink one for my 3 year old daughter they love love them and I don't have to worry about them falling off. by the way for the space on the sides i put a bed cover before putting in the mattress and that simply filled the space without any fear that the kid will pull it out since its base is under the mattress so my little one is safe ! Ohh the only thing wrong with both of my beds was in setting them up the left side of the upper screws did not fit but i can live with that
4,Great first bed!,"I bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib. He moves around A LOT in his sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him. He absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before. The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now. Eventually we'll put the box spring back in."
3,This bed is great,"One of our friends gave my son this bed when he was 2. He's 4 now and he loves it; so do all the kids that stay over someone always wants to sleep in the ""car bed"""
2,A few problems to note,"We bought this bed for our 4 year old who loves cars. This is the most expensive Little Tikes purchase we have made. The hardware that came with the bed did not match what was listed on the instruction sheet and took 4 days to be sent after the bed arrived. Anyone with a 4 year old knows that 4 days is an eternity to them. Also, the assembly was VERY difficult. It took us 2 hours of trying to insert 1 of the 4 long screws. Even now it isn't completely inserted. I normally love Little Tikes toys but this one did not seem up to par."
3,Very misleading dimension size for mattress,"We bought two of these beds, and the dimensions are terribly misleading from Little Tikes manufacturer as there is a 4"" gap leaving 2"" on each side for young children to get thier arms, legs stuck in. The plywood dimensions are also off, so there is alot of disappointment with the price tag!The actual true dimensions are 41"" x 75"" for the mattress and its almost impossible to find one that fits."
1,Would not buy again,"The bed showed up early, missing all the hardware and the wheel kit for the it. I had to call amazon which lead to nowhere and then had to call little tikes which was not too bad to deal with, The Customer service lady said that oh this happens all the time Nice!!!! After 4 days the hardware showed up Easy to put together but there is a lot of space on both sides of the mattress and at the top we filled it in with some heavily blankets and seems to work just fine. I wish I would have just brought the Step Two Bed it looks like its better quality!!!!!"
2,sharp edges,"CONS: The perimeter edges are very sharp, stiff pieces of the hard clear plastic. About every 3 feet in the center of roll there was a 3 inch broken hole in the plastic mesh, this also added to the sharp puncture nature of the plastic mesh. Quality control was lacking when it shipped to miss this defect.PROS: Very strong mesh, lots of attachment zip ties and eye screws. Clear so it can't be seen from a distance."
4,Keeps the baby from leaning over the edge,"We bought two of these to cover our deck. We did all around it and down the one side of the stairs where there was nothing blocking him from going over. He liked to lean out over the middle beam and I worried about him falling over. We ended up having to staple it to the top of the deck and zip-tie the middle. We did use the hooks they provided on the lower part where we zip-tied it on through the loops. The directions they gave would not work well with our deck, so we improvised.The plastic netting is very sturdy and we secured it so well that there is very little give on it. Now, if I could just talk my inlaws into putting up on their back deck where he actually did fall off, luckily on the edge on the slope and not the end!"
1,Sent it back,"I really didn't like this. The whole thing has sharp edges and it is just not safe to use for your baby, in my opinion. I sent it back."
4,Easy and safe,This was easy to put up and keeps my toddler from throwing things off the deck. It's clear also so it doesn't look like I'm barricading us into the apartment.
5,Nice child safety product,"I ordered two of these for our two story terrace in order to keep my 1 and 3 year olds out of harms way. I've read some negative things about the edges, but I seriously do not see a problem. The netting is made out of a very strong transparent material. You can not see the netting from a distance, and the product is quality in my opinion. We are very pleaseed with this product."
1,"Fail for me, great for my pooch!","I saw none of the benefits listed on the bottle with my use. It left my hair dry and brittle. I used this on my poodle'shair and it's great!Leave him shiny and clean, no irritation."
2,I gave it to my sister,"I have thick hair, but I have a problem with breakage and frizz. This did not help me at all...in fact it made it worse! My hair became very coarse and broke off even more than before use.My sister on the other hand and very thin soft hair. She likes it.If you want fullness but don't care about softness this shampoo is for you."
4,"A wonderful, rhyming book that's great at bedtime or anytime","This book really sparked the interest of my preschooler (age three). He enjoys rhyming books and was very interested at the different activities of this baby (who is actually an older toddler). Pretty, soft pictures made it enjoyable to read aloud each night. I recommend for any new baby gift, as the rhyming words would make a soothing story for an infant and the child will grow with the book."
5,"Great ""snuggle time"" book !","My 3 year old granddaughter loves this book ! It holds her attention as she snuggles in my lap and smiles and tries to answer the on-going question, ""Where's the baby ?"" It's becoming a fast favorite, and I love the calming effect it has on her. It's a perfect bed time book."
5,Tragic,"the group never got off the studio floor with this album, from start to finish this cd was great. you rarly find a cd that good from start to finish... my personal thought is the cover, if you wanted to hipe these bros, you should have put them in tim's or nike's or northface jacket's to bring an appeal to the masses at the time this album was released. they looked like some candy shop singer's from the sixty's.. beside that this album should be a collector's item..."
4,mellow!!,"i just recently came across these new guys on a motown various artists page,i will say they have a nice mellow sound,n sound a tab like boys II men n brian mcknight,but not enough that you become bored with them!!maybe the more i listen to them i might even like them more, but for now they are ok!!i always love the ballads if they are done right,not over done if you know what i mean!!the motown sound!!joey hoffman of dover pa.united states!!!!"
1,Not worth a penny,"I bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use, making them completely unusable."
4,Makes the game more comfy,"Comfy ...yes! Easy to use...Yes! The hot pack is a one time deal. You have to buy a new hot pack every time you want to use one. Cold packs are not included but can be reused.These seats are not super durable. We bought 5. By the end of our first football game the support for one of them had poked through the plastic. It is still good and usuable and I would buy them again...but, just so you know."
1,PolarHeat Soft Shell Stadium Seat review,I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. One of the seats was broken when I received it. The ribs on the sides of the seat back seem to be made of light weight plastic and were broken. It seemed as though it would not take much to break one if you sat back in this chair. The whole point of a stadium seat is to give back support where there typically is none. This chair did not provide adequate support.
1,Disappointing Stadium Seat,"We were disappointed in the stadium seats. They provided no back support, even though there is a ""back"" to the chair. The seat portion is too deep to fit on the bench seats of the grand stands, so it was difficult to keep it centered so that it would not collapse or fall when we leaned forward or backward. All-in-all, I found it to be a bit better than sitting directly on the grand stand bench seat, not nearly as nice as the old-fashioned stadium seats with a shallow seat portion and true back support, and about equal to sitting on a cusion seat with no back attached.On the positive side, they were easy to carry back and forth to the game; and, when folded closed, formed a little pocket in which to carry our other game gear. They were also less expensive than traditional stadium seats."
1,Stay away from Money 2005,"I purchased MSM 2005 about 6 months ago. The program has crashed on me numerous times, corrupting my master file. It has taken hours to reconstruct the data, and to get my back-up data back into the software. Downloading information from my bank and investment companies is hit and miss. Some days it works, others it doesn't.Reports are much harder to customize than previously, and even the disk back-up is ""broken"" IMHO. (Rather than just re-using floppies as in past versions, now you must delete the old copy of the backup file first).This is without doubt the worst software purchase I've made in years."
1,Terrible product,"I read the other reviews that were posted and I didn't believe them. I have always loved Microsoft products for their ease of use and simplicity. However, it is as if Microsoft Money was not design by Microsoft. The software is quite difficult to use and their is also no interoperability. I currently have Microsoft Outlook 2003, and one would assume that the address book in Microsoft Money would be interoperable with Outlook. However, there is not such link. You are forced to use Microsoft Money's sub-standard address book. Even though Money does allow the user to import the address book from Outlook, there should be an option that allows me to change my default address to Outlook. The installation of the software also looked nothing like Microsoft Office's setup and again it looked sub-standard.If you are looking for a solution to track financial information, I would highly recommend using Microsoft Excel instead - it's cheaper and much more flexible."
1,"Everything was going fine, until...","My computer had a hard crash while MS Money was open (the crash may not have been MS Money's fault). Upon rebooting, I was unable to open the MS Money data file. Additionally, ALL of the MS Money backup files were corrupt. I had to rebuild everything from scratch. What good is the software if it can't recover from a crash?Also, I was able to import my old quicken files into MS Money, but found that MS Money will not allow you to change the original amount of an existing loan after the loan had been set up. I would have thought that you could change values like that."
1,I wish I had bought something else,"I bought Money 2005 Small Business Edition to create some basic financial accounting for my small business. The product came with no guide, neither on paper, nor on screen - for anything you need, you need to go online. The product constant encourages you to go online - but do you want to go online with all your financials open? Could a user have Microsoft or anyone else start browsing through his finances? Unfortunately, basic functions, such as decreasing a balance on a client invoice due to a credit, seem impossible to find. I wish I had bought something else."
1,Do Not Upgrade!!,"I currently have the 2004 which I upgraded from 2002. Everything was fine, therefore I would only expect 2005 to be better than 2004. It was awful, I returned the product within hours!! 2005 is made up entirely of advertisements displayed all over the place, it isn't user friendly and the features that I liked in the previous versions are gone. I am extremely disappointed and highly recommended not getting the 2005 version!"
1,Do not buy,"I have same issues as first poster.I have 3.2GHz Pentium 4 Dell with 1Gb ram and you would think it's my old good pentium 75MHz.I had to get rid of all the elements from front page just so i can start using it under 2 minutes. Othervise, if you put couple of graphs you'd better go make fresh coffee, take a walk and if you are lucky... well you got the point.Also, It always crashes when I click on bills and deposits, or budget.Anly remedy after 2 weeks of frustrations...uninstall and go back to 2004.Cheers"
2,Unacceptable file imports/ upgrade behavior,"While I felt the software was useful, I thought it occasionally was unintuitive and difficult to use. The invoice designer did not work very well, and the general interface was somewhat complicated and unintuitive. My greatest complaint is with the way the system opens files. I can't go into detail, but opening an existing file on a new system is a nighmare. I cannot say what the reason for this is except maybe related to online updates prior to the opening of the file on a new system. However, after updating the new system, problems still abounded. I would not recommend this software to anyone at this price. Maybe at, say, $39.95?"
4,Excel 2003 PPVBA,"Book was helpful in the setup of various 'maintenance' routines. It gave me a fresh look at the use of properties, allowing me to streamline the coding. Unfortunately, company directives have us converting the work to 'active server pages' with a SQL 2005 database server. Since the source data is Oracle, I have been working on DB to DB utilities."
2,OK - If you know what you are looking for,"I bought this book based on the review of others. If this is really the best out there, somebody new needs to get started writing Excel books.IF you already know some programming concepts and IF you are willing to spend alot of time combing through the book, you might find what you are looking for. I found just enough to put my old programming experience together with Excel's built-ins and alot of trial and error to get what I needed.The index is pathetic, clearly put together by a computer rather than a knowledgeable human being. The examples are all focused on the formatting of cells or cutesy message boxes. Message boxes can be useful, but if I only needed Excel to format data, I wouldn't need to write code."
5,Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA (Excel Power Programming With Vba),A great resource for any one who compiles a plethora of spreadsheets for their company.
4,Good Book - but not for beginners,This is a very good book but not for beginners. This book for people who intermediate level Excel/VBA programmers and wish to go further. The organization of this book is poor but it is all there if you look. Excel/VBA topics are well treated. However if you are looking for ADO or working with databases this is not the book. With these caveats I give this book high marks.
2,"Overall, disappointed","Like some previous reviewers, I was disappointed with some of the dated material presented in this book. If you have the Excel 2000 book by Walkenbach, then you basically have this book. My purchase was returned for refund. A very good book to contrast this with would be Steve Roman's book (O'Reilly). I take offense to the over the top comments of reviewers such as ""intelligent-but-not-so-wise."" A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably isn't."
3,VBA Programming,"Most of the examples in this book will not work unless you load the accompanying CD. I did not load the CD and most of the examples that I typed did not work. I am a novice and this book is very hard to understand, especially if the examples will not work on their own. I am trying to Excel programming with VBA for work and this is really not helping me."
5,Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA,"The book was brand new as said in the description. Had a CD which was nice to find certain things in the book easier. The book itself though has very easy examples, so if you plan to do complicated programming, you might want to consider something else (if there is anything better available)."
4,Excel 2003 Personal Review,"I read through the work while looking at my own Excel programs and have improved some greatly. The book obviously is not for beginners -- too many assumptions on general usages. Overall, a good guide to use."
1,Not really for power programmers,"I'm a reasonably experienced excel vba programmer, so when I resort to a reference guide for Power Programmers, I expect to find authoritative and well-organized information. The organization of this book makes me crazy. Firstly the index is a joke. There is no excuse for this, given the wide availability of good index-building software. This is not for power programmers, it's for beginners that need had-holding. That's fie, but too much of this book's real value is in it's CD --- except the coy I got wouldn't mount on a Mac drive, and (of course) there no good way to grep the contents of the CD. Save your money.PS I first wrote this review after the book first came out in 2004 --- I don't know why it's no longer on Amazon. I've repeated it at this late date because the book is still available for sale."
1,not worth.,"This not shows correct salt level and temp, wast of money. so i will not recommend this product.we will get same price other product."
3,Moderately Helpful,What I needed was a really better guide to helpful eating plans. This is a very helpful as far as how you view the eating process and how you can change that to help you establish a better eating program. There are many helpful suggestions on how to change your attitudes on eating.
1,Lots of talking but not much use,"This is the lowest rating I've given a product. It goes on and on. I was expecting diet plans, receipes, etc to plan a yoga diet - nothing here. I gave up reading it after the first few pages."
1,Pitiful,You would assume anything marked as 2X Large would fit someone larger than your average munchkin. But not this garment. If this is a 2XL then . . . Couldn't even get the thing over both my shoulders. Let alone actually put it on to wear somewhere.Totally worthless.
2,Very Mediocre Reproductions,"I'm a native of Chicago, where the Art Institute has the largest collection of French Impressionism outside of Paris. So I've seen many of the originals of the works in this book. I'm also a photographer, so I have a critical eye, and I know how hard it is to get a good reproduction in a book of a work of art. Nonetheless, this book contains some of the worst prints I've seen. The colors are flat and lifeless and the shadows are clipped, which has blocked up the blacks and therefore ruined the contrast.There's lot of in-depth information on the history of the art form. But visually it's a stinker. If you've never seen the magnificent work of the impressionists, this book will NOT ignite your interest in this genre, it's just too poorly printed."
3,book on impressionism,"too many black and white photos. would not buy this book again, as impressionism is about color."
4,race car rocks,"My husband (and son) love this bed. It made transition from crib to big boy bed very easy. The only negative is the toy box is not hooked on in any way and the lid falls off constantly. Other than that, he would eat, sleep and live in it (my husband:)Really it rocks!"
2,Not a very enjoyable trip!,"I really wanted to enjoy this DVD, but the narration and the pace of this particular train journey is slightly dry and boring. There is more of documentary and talk, than actual shooting of the train trip. In the narration, there is reference to stunning surroundings, beautiful scenes and all that, but there really is nothing that's actually been shot as part of this journey except for the interiors! This always made me feel that something good is coming up on the way, but it never does!"
1,Avoid the Northern Belle video,"The Luxury Trains of the World series is a wonderful train series, but this video, ""The Northern Belle"", is a major disappointment. It is certainly the worst of the series, hands down. There is an incredibly lengthy talking head, telling you about the other trains that this company runs. Very very little of the scenery is shown and where it is, it is mostly with train tracks superimposed on the scenery. Even at its low price this is one video that is vastly overpriced and best to be avoided."
1,Pet Owners Use Caution,"I used this edging in my backyard and it was easy to install and looked great. Within 30 days my dog slashed his rear leg badly which required surgery - $550. We had no idea what could have done such damage and we were very worried about our children in the yard, but we could never find any obvious dangers. At Christmas my dog came in the house, and again had a deep cut on his front leg. Another trip to the vet, another surgery - $550. This time the vet asked the specific question, 'Do you have lawn edging?' Well, yes, but it is fiberglass, not aluminum or anything dangerous. Well, lesson learned - the fiberglass is just as dangerous as aluminum. I ripped all of the edging out of the back yard. For $1100 I could have edged the yard with some really nice landscaping brick. Buyer beware."
4,Great resource for your lighthouse travels,"I recently took a trip to California and visited a few of the lighthouses in the book. I purchased this book in advance and brought it with me on my travels. As I approached each lighthouse visited, I read from the book to my ""travel-mates"". We learned the directions and a brief history of each lighthouse. The information was condensed, easy-to-read and informative. Best of all, the directions for finding each lighthouse were accurate. This book was a great resource for planning my trip and I hope to use it again in the future as a reference when I return to the area to see a few more California lighthouses. A great travel resource and also a great book to just read and learn more."
1,Please Please don't buy this book,This book is horrible. I was very very disappointed. This book does not live up to the title at all. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Very pretty girl with a very pretty name; unfortunately her music cannot be similarly described,"She tried her best and she had a bunch of producers behind her, but this album of standard beats and less than extraordinary singing is definitely for Lateasha lovers only."
1,"""Just Enough"" is more than enough.....","""Just Enough"" is more than enough: A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work. Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature. At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages! Better to read ""Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood,"" by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day."
3,I've had enough,"I don't know. I want to like this book. But it is just so long-winded! The brief stories about how others have found balance are inspiring, but are few and far between. Their concept is good, compelling, even motivating, yet it is overwhelmed by gads of unnecessary and distracting jabs at people who base their success on the ""wrong"" things (aren't these folks their audience?), as well as at the media for touting these people as successes. Skim it at the bookstore -- you'll get the overall (good) idea without wading through hours of self-grandizing text."
3,Good framework / weak on existing social science,"Authors have an excellent framework for considering these issues.They seem to address the book to the ""power and money mad"" reader.They ignore considerable research demonstrating that those who value intrinsic motivators live longer, are happier, and are more healthy.This is THE book for the power and money hungry who need to see the world in more balanced terms."
3,Great for the family of 4,"We've gone out almost everyday since I've purchased 2 of the tandem trailers! My daughters, 6 and 4 years, love it. It's great excercise for us, especially with the extra pounds on the back.I, like one of the other reviewers, have had problems with my seat turning and staying there whenever I make a turn. The pivot point on the tandem looks like it's built to pivot up and down, left to right. However, it is just to tight. I suggested that my husband loosen the bolt but that causes the trailer to wobble to much. I've learned to not make that many 90 degree turns! I hope to contact the manufacturer and try to resolve the problem. It looks like the washers might be on the wrong side of the connection.All that said, it is a great thing to be able to go bike riding with the kids and not have to worry about them riding their own bike and all the waiting for them to catch up."
2,Adult's seat twists when turning,"As another reviewer described, the design of this product has a problem. On making turns, this bike often twists the adult's seat post, leaving the seat crooked. It's really a pain to stop riding and twist the seat back. I don't know how to fix this unit, or if it's possible to fix. We hardly ever use it because of this problem."
4,Now kids can ride with mom and dad,"We bought two of the trailers since two of our kids have a tough time keeping up with mom, dad and big sister on bike rides. We ride on bike trails or around the neighborhood and they enjoy riding. They even think they are pedaling for us if we stop pedaling! I would recommend this product."
4,1-2-3-let's go,"What a difference, before I had been waiting for my 5 year old to catch up and at times that took the fun out of biking.He was scared of the cars would turn to the site and stop until they passed, unfortunately in Texas there are not so many biking trails!Now with the Hitchhicker he is peddling like a pro and we both have a great time.WE LOVE THE HITCHHICKER !!!"
4,Great Idea!,"This looks great and I want to get it for my son who will be 4 yrs old, but my daughter needs to sit in a seat behind my seat in a child seat since she'll be 1 yr. I wonder if these 2 accessories will both fit on my bike at once??"
4,Great collection of Motown rarities,"This CD contains unreleased Christmas songs from Motown's major hit makers. My favorites are Marvin's Purple Snowflakes and the Supremes' Silent Night, with Florence on lead. Diana does a solo act on This Christmas, and there's a great instrumental from the Funk Brothers on Winter Wonderland as well. It's out of print, but you're into the Motown sound, get this CD to add to your collection."
4,Christmas in Motor City,"This CD features Motown Christmas rarities. Lots of fine stuff here. My personal favorite is ""I Just Want To Come Home For Christmas"", by Marvin Gaye. It's a moving song about being away from your family on Christmas, and it gets me choked up. Your Motown Christmas collection isn't complete without this CD."
3,"Nice unit, useless pouch","The unit itself works quite well. It does its job without fuss, and it has a lot more memory locations than you need - 60.One issue: you cannot really really store the unit in its pouch without pressing the on/off button while you are zipping it or carying it around. (One solution: take the batteries off before storing it.)As the pouch was an important part of my buying decision, I can only give it three stars."
1,Junky!,"I found this product to be a waste of money. I purchased it last Tuesday and found the systolic readings to be irregularly - and therefore unreliably - between 2 and 20 mmHg different from a human measurement. I was frustrated with the inaccuracy of the product and thought perhaps it was just a faulty machine. I considered sending it back for replacement when yesterday the plug that connects the cuff to the computer snapped off. Why would I want to spend $15 and a trip to the post office for another junky, inaccurate tool?"
2,disappointment,While the unit read blood pressure it was not properly calibrated and read pressure 20-30 points off which scared the daylights out of me until I figured out the problem
4,Very cute but runs small,These shoes are super cute but I had to return my 7's because they were too small. I can wear a dress show from a 6.5 - 7.5 depending on the brand but these were too small because of the elastic. The leather is very thin - that was the other reason I returned them. It's really really soft and the gold is really pretty but there is no way these shoes would take any kind of slight abuse and survive.
4,Comfortable after stretching.,When I first got these shoes I thought I had made a mistake. The elastic was so tight that I felt like my heals were bruised. I went to the store and bought some shoe stretch devices to hold the shoes in a elongated position. Now I leave them in the shoes when I'm not wearing them and they feel fine.
2,Nine West Women's Luvmyflats,These shoes was good only for an indoor activity. I returned them to the seller because I bought them as a summer shoes.
5,Really enjoyed the music,I don't know any French but this CD is mixed with English and French and it's a great mix. I really enjoyed 11 of the 14 songs.
4,Sunrise and Takahashi selected a great song for Inu-Yasha,"a very good J-alt.rock band. This song fits Inu-Yasha well, and it's a good song otherwise. hitomi is one of my favorite bands."
1,Sunset across Bosnia more like,"Does anything remotely like the events that transpire in this ridiculous novel ever happen in real life? aside from being sappy and extremely sentimental this novel is also guilty of being outrageously unrealistic. How often in those days did girls begin their lives in abusive relationships in india and end up utah mormons. honestly, this is a perfectly revolting piece of work!"
3,Illustrator CS3 -Buy something cheaper if it works for you,"I was forced to buy Adobe Illustrator CS3. Adobe gets way too much money for their software. Yes, it is the best, and it is the industry leader, but CorelDraw X3 Graphics Suite is an excellent performer for a fraction of the cost. X3 includes CorelDraw (competes with Illustrator)Adobe Creative Suite CS3 Design Premium Upgrade [Mac]Adobe Creative Suite CS3 Design Premium Upgradeand PhotoPaint (competes with Adobe PhotoShop). The only reason I had to buy Illustrator CS3 is because CorelDraw could not open some of the Illustrator CS2 and CS3 files I received and I needed them for my business. So if you don't need to open the latest version of Illustrator files, look into Corel and save yourself a bundle! You can download Corel trial software for free to try before you buy."
5,Happiness on Seven Dollars a Week: A Formula for Living,"Happiness on Seven Dolllars a Week is a great read. It is very insightful on how to create a formula for living. At the same time, it is very heartwarming, since it involves the relationships of a family as they struggle through a very difficult time in their lives. Through these relationships, we experience the formula for living in a very personal and real way.I highly recommend this book! You won't be able to put it down once you start reading it.Reader in Maine"
5,Warmly motivating and highly recommended reading,"Happiness On 7 Dollars A Week: A Formula For Living is an inspirational collection of writings by Harley B. Bernstein, couched in the format of a series of walks, father and son. Following the adjustment of Harley's father to the illness and death of his beloved wife, and revealing an inspirational formula to understanding happiness and the incalculable wealth of a life well-lived, Happiness On 7 Dollars A Week is warmly motivating and highly recommended reading -- especially for anyone seeking to live a life of appreciation and quiet personal accomplishment during hard times."
5,What every child wishes they could do.,"To help retatin the memory of their father, most of us would be pleased to be able to share their teachings with friends and family. Harley Bernstein gets to share his father's words with all of us.ALthough this sounds sticky sweet, I found this a heartwarming read. It's an easy read, although I went back to passages to think on them over and over. Share it with your own father."
2,"Kibble and bits, no real meat.","With so many unclear and shallow explanations and very little effort in actually teaching, and instead packaging a scrambled mess of facts and information; this book has left me disappointed and unsatisfied.I am far from a novice when it comes to computers, but I struggled many times trying to make mental connections; basically putting all the puzzle pieces together in this scattered and incomplete jigsaw puzzle. As far as being prepared for the MCSE/MCSA test after reading this book, I'm no more confident than I was before.Being that there were no reviews for this book here on Amazon, along with the low popularity shown by the sales rank and the high price, I would never have boughten this book had one of my classes not required it.Anyone considering this book, my suggestion to you would be to look for a tried and true, better quality book, that's actually worth the money."
1,Not worth your time,"After being very disappointed with ""Total Eclips"", I was hoping ""Summertime"" would turn out to be a better thriller, but it didn't deliver either.No more Liz Rigbey for me.If you want to read thrillers that are compelling from the first page on, I recommend anything by Carlene Thompson, Patricia Highsmith, Peter Robinson and Val McDermid to name a few."
2,Very Dry and a difficult read,"to be honest - this book was impossible to read. director is an exciting program and this book was impossible to read, i felt like i was trying to make it through mobey dick, and everyone knows, its hard to learn when you aren't engaged. I bought this from borders, and im planning on bringing it back there. I bought director MX 2004 Bible instead, and within reading 2 pages i bought it knowing i'd love it. This is a manual, a very dry manual."
2,A Book Written by Dummies,"This book should have been entitled how to sell your song writing professionally. This book has little to do with creating or writing music. The title is very misleading and I feel like I just flushed a wad of hard earned money down the toilet. About the only thing useful in this book is some of the information on how to get your music noticed and circulated, which doesn't interest me since I have no ambition to become a professional musician."
5,"Songwriting for Dummies, would-bes and something for pros",You don't expect to get this much from a teach-yourself book; I can't say how much I learned from it. Worth it's weight in gold. Could be worth more if you start writing hit songs.
3,Easy reading,I bought this book cause I needed some information no other music books has and I recieved it. Thank so very much Amazon.
4,Great used book purchase!,Just got my book today. Other than a few smudges on the cover (nothing a paper towel couldn't fix) it looks just like it would have if I had bought it new for so much more! Got it right on the first day it could be delivered. Great purchase.
3,Solid information and useful,"This was the first songwriting book I ever read so ALL of it was useful. I figured I was a dummy at writing songs so this was a good place to start! The basic information is here with examples I was able to find and listen to. There are good tips on making your songs better. I thought it could be organized better though, and there could have been more on melody and chords. It seems like there's more about writing lyrics in most of the songwriting books i read."
5,simply the best,This book is simply the best book on songwriting...and i think i've read them all - believe me! It had a way of simplifying and demystifying the whole process of creating songs. Great for 'ol pros and also great for newcomers too. This book is top on my list.
5,songwriting for dummies,This is my favorite songwriting book so far! From writing a hit song to getting it in the public eye all topics are covered. i intend on reading this book cover to cover. Thank you to the people who i bought it from!
4,The real deal,"I found the book extremely helpful in providing insights into what really makes eBay work. Community, feedback, trusted third-party, and a business that believes in the inherent good of its members."
4,"Good look at ebay, both the company & community","The Perfect Store is an interesting internet startup story because it spends almost as much time discussing the company's customers (""the community"") as the company itself. Ebay may turn out to be the greatest success story of the early internet companies and hence its story merits special attention. I found the book to be well written and an easy read."
4,A great tale - well written,"This is a captivating book. A well written account of one of the only true internet successes, and a great antidote to the many stories of the internet's spectacular failures. The story that emerges, that so much of eBay's growth is due to Omidyar's world-view - less about greed and more about people and community - show that sometimes nice guys do finish first."
2,Can this author kiss anymore a**?,"OK... I like ebay- I've actually know quite a few people that work there, and I've been lucky enough to see the organization from some pretty unqiue perspectives. But of all the go-Ebay fans I've met, I don't think any of them match the uncensored bliss that Adam Cohen seems to hold for this marketplace. If I wanted a puff piece that blew sunshine up Meg WHitman's ""dressed-down Ebayasian khakis"", I would turn to USAtoday or some other weak-kneed publication. Cohen defintely adds some unique tidbits of history, but the endless anqecdotes of ebay lust become sickening. After reading Cohen's text, one would wonder if ebay has found the cure for cancer yet..."
2,A waste of time,"The world doesn't need another book on the overrated website ebay.com. This book is a dull read and includes nothing new. The author regurgitated old news articles from time, newsweek and the tv."
3,"An illustrative story of eBay, good historical facts but lacks in-depth analysis and insight","Focusing on the early days of eBay, this book presents good historical facts from eBay and the merchants point of view. It needs a deeper analysis and insight for reader to relate more. And the content is outdated, no story behind Paypal & Skype acquisition."
1,A passion for eBay,"As an eBay user since 1997, both as buyer and seller, I found this book curiously bland and totally lacking in passion for a subject of which the users are quite passionate. Frankly, I was bored to death while reading it, waiting and waiting for one of the stories to show some excitement and it never did. Forget the book, just go to eBay community instead."
4,Extraordinary View Inside the Greatest Site of the .Com Era,"Cohen's book really hits the mark. I'm not usually a big fan of business books, but this one flows and rolls along. It reads easily and with an honest eye (something those folks at the NY Times, Cohen's paper, sometimes have trouble with). Anyway, I enjoyed the story of the company and the smaller stories about sellers. These people are a little nuts, but fascinating. Who knew people collected irons? Anyway, I'm an avid Ebayer and this book got me more interested. If only I had the money to buy the stock...Overall, fair and balanced protrait of a site that has quickly become a part of American history."
3,Silver really cool Purple boring to tears,"Well just how the title says the purple video has the slow part you know boring songs like AVALON, FFH, CAEDMON'S CALL, LARUE, CHRIS RICE, the only bands that are stands out are DCTALK, STEVE CURTIS CHAPMAN, SMALTOWN POETS, but the rest are a waste of video.On the other hand we have the SILVER VIDEO that is awesome. The cool bands are DELIRIOUS, NEWSBOYS (live), AUDIO ADRENALINE, RAZE, SWITCHFOOT, SUPERTONES, BLEACH the rest are kinda slow and sick like THIRD DAY (Yuck) and, PLANKEYE... CHASING FURIES is the best of all =)I missed the interviews and they could of done better selecting videos, well that's my opinio anyway..."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I bought 2 of these, one for each of my girls. Worked the first few times, then both broke. Would not play. I changed the batteries.Still not working. This was very frustrating for both my girls and I. They were very dissapointed because they love music and love the princesses."
5,Disney Princess Personal CD Player,"My 6 year old daughter got this for her birthday and absolutly loves it. this is a great first cd player for little girls easy to use, although the pictures can be canged it is hard to remove the top to change the picture(it comes with 2 other pictures besides the one already on the front cover).Overall this is an excellent cd player for your daughter."
3,Thoughtful,"I like this story of a man, and a minister, coming out gay in the UMC. It's a thoughtful and interesting tale of how a man learns to know his own sexuality and how his church cope with that. But inbetween this story we get mr. Rush's own poetry and lyrics and I could frankly do without it. I did not find it good. I chosed to skip over it."
2,boring,Just added Transylmania to my list of movies to skip. Looked boring and I do not plan on watching. Simply a matter of taste.
2,Dull and Lumbering,"The title of my review says it all. I liked all the pieces recorded here just not these interpretations.I know the tempo markings on most of the peaces indicate a slow and solemn speed, but not this slow to the point of being laboriously dull! Just my thoughts"
1,Junk!,Total junk! The cards are good for about 1 use. The dome thing the numbers go into doesn't stay together at all. Total waste of money. Luckily it wasn't that much.
3,Not for 512MB Memory Stick,This Works for SD at 512MB.But for the Sony Duo (Memory Stick) it only goes up to 128MB...Other than the MB limitations it works just fine.
1,Not for Visual Learners,"If any aspect of biomedical science calls for ample illustration, it is anatomy. While this was one of the first anatomy texts I purchased at the onset of my Gross Anatomy course at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine (where the Oklahoma Notes series is understandably popular), it was the book I used the least because of the lack of illustrations. Even at the end of the course, when I had covered everything in the course, I still couldn't use this book to review for my final exam without having a copy of Netter's Atlas open--and I usually just ended up studying the atlas and ditching the Oklahoma Notes book. As for the subsections covering embryology, neuroanatomy and microanatomy (histology), there are much better textbooks and review books out there with adequate illustrations--my favorites, respectively, were Moore and Persaud's ""The Developing Human,"" Young and Young's ""Basic Clinical Neuroanatomy,"" and Burkitt's ""Wheater's Functional Histology."""
3,"Anatomy: Embryology, Neuroanatomy, Gross Anatomy, Microanatomy",The material is very good and very simple but only shortage of even single diagram related to the topic. I did not understand the authors criteria by excluding diagrams.
5,Luxurious Sound!,"People complain about Karajan's perfection. Is that insane or what? Here is a great recording of Karajan, a conductor whose engineering background translates into superior orchestral timbres and precision. All this, mixed with DG's immaculate sound quality make this one of the most satisfying compilations ever. This is the type of CD I'd recommend for somebody who dislikes classical music... or just hasn't had the proper introduction. This is just such an introducion."
2,Blade cracked!,"I received this knife for Christmas last year and I absolutely loved it. However, after a year of normal use (and gentle cleaning, handling, etc...it was expensive so naturally I took good care of it) it began to show rust spots on the blade. Shortly after I noticed a crack running half way up the blade. I cannot use it anymore, due to the crack. It seems like for the price the blade should be more durable. I am very dissappointed, as I always heard great things about this brand."
5,Absolutely the best!,"I've been cooking for more than 40 years (I trained under a Cordon Bleu chef in the late 1960s but have never cooked professionally), and this is, without a doubt the finest knife I have ever owned. Does that mean there may not be a better knife out there? No, but if there is it is going to be some custom made knife that I would be unwilling to sell my house for in order to be able to afford! My wife says the handle is to large for her to use comfortably but it fits my hand perfectly. She also says it is a bit heavy for her, yet I have found her using it on many occasions. With its great balance and ergonomic handle it is really a joy to use. And, of course, there is the fact that with appropriate care you will be able to pass it on to your kids. I just can't say enough good about this knife!! If you can afford it, this is SO the knife to buy."
3,get a handle!,"love the blade. the handle, not so much. got the 2 knife set about a year ago (this one w/ the paring knife.) the blades are great, super sharp and cut well. however the handles on both knives cracked in several places after only a few months of TLC care. (hand washing only, handled carefully). I love henkel knives and have used them for years, I will just get them with a different kind of handle in the future. also with this particular model it took me a few weeks to get used to the handle-heavy balance."
5,Very nice knife!,"I bought this as a birthday present and have to say it is an amazing knife. I've always been a huge fan of hollow-edge santoku knifes, I use them for pretty much everything. This one is made in Germany (I believe all of the Zwilling knifes are, but the regular J.A. Henckels are made in China... which I have used a few of the nicer ones and they are not bad knifes either, just not quite as balanced as the Twin line).I really like the ergonomics and balance of the Twin Cuisine line, and I like the stamped end on it. I also like the Twin Star II line, it's a toss up really. You can cut effortlessly with these knives (between how sharp they are (and stay!), the balance and the 'hollow' channels prevent what you are cutting from sticking to the knife)."
5,The Knife we fight over,"My husband, a french-culinary school graduate, and I, his culinary-challenged spouse, both love this knife. We have a drawer full of knives, but this is the one we both reach for. Just be careful. It is really, really sharp."
4,One of the originals,"Vampire lovers every where have to read this book, just because it was one of the first vampire books that is still recognized. It is true that Rymer isn't the world's geatest writter, and I think I kind of understand why they were called penny dreadfuls, but still read this book. It's good, considering, and it's an excellent book to refer to. Bram Stoker is thought to be influnced by Varney. Fang fanatics, expecially ones of the classic nature, should read this book."
4,A tough slog,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is what is known as a ""penny dreadful"". Ryder was paid by the WORD, which becomes quite apparent after reading a few pages of endless dialogue. However, the importance of this tale's influence on other vampire writers cannot be overlooked. Many familar themes are here- the vampire has a ghastly pallour, lustreless eyes and sharp teeth, he can be revived by moonlight, and what's interesting to any Dark Shadows fan is the plotline where hanging in Bannerworth Hall is a painting of a long dead nobleman who looks just like the suspected vampire (which perhaps also influenced LeFanu in ""Carmilla""). You'll probably find yourself skimming through pages- a few sentences and you'll get the gist of what's happening. But this is a volume that any vampire literary collector should have in their library."
2,you should know...,"i ordered this t-shirt as a gift for someone... appears that it would come in white to me. The fact is that the combi doesnt guarantee color, and just sends out random ones... i was mailed a bright red t-shirt which unfortunately isnt going to workout. be warned. i called the company and they were apologetic, but nothing they can do.. if i take the time to return it, i will follow-up with commentary on how that goes,"
1,LAME.,"This album is such a bore. BOTH OF THEIR ALBUMS ARE HORRIBLE. I don't know how they even got this onto the album without the computer breaking. I got this album because I mistakenly thought it was the OTHER band Antimatter (Mick Moss) which is musical genius. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. If you thought this was the same Antimatter that did ""Planetary Confinement,"" ""Leaving Eden,"" ""Savior,"" or ""Lights Out"" you're mistaken. Run as fast as you can. This is horrible. It sounds like somebody pushed the record button and played on the keyboard while drunk for a few hours. LAME."
3,fun but helmet too small,"My almost 4 year old has fun with these skates. They are not fast enough to be dangerous or scary. Only problem is that the helmet is very small. It doesn't even fit my 10 month old, much less the 4 year old it is intended to fit. Beware if your child's head is larger than average!"
3,fun to get dressed up for skating,"My son got this for his 3rd birthday, and since then I think he's tried the skating maybe 4 times in the past 8 months. He likes wearing the helmet, knee and wrist guards, but the skates are hard to put on. He's pretty agile, but I think this might be more appropriate for a 4 year old or older child. Also, the helmet is not approved for bike riding, which is something to keep in mind."
4,Only Two Years Old and Blading already!!!,"I got these for my 28 month old daughter for Valentines Day as she is fascinated by skating. They are a pain to put on, but she doesn't mind. They have ""beginner"" settings, which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the ""expert"" setting! What I like is all the safety gear come with them, so she knows that she has to wear it ""all or nothing"". These are great and seem to be safe and sturdy...with supervision, of course!"
5,"A no-nonsense, easy to read eference","I really enjoyed this book. Contrary to many other ""manuals"", this one has nothing that's unneeded or unimportant - no watery phrases, no stupid stories - just up to the point, precise information on subjects such as sources of the mortgage money, reading the fine print, ARMs, FHA and VA loans. It even includes Ammortization and Loan Progress Tables..And it's very easy to read and understand!"
1,Nice CD but only a few songs,"I got this CD for only one song, but decided to listen to the rest of the album. I was sort of dissappointed to find out that only 2 or 3 songs on the CD played. I didn't make a big issue out of it because the song I purchased the CD for played and I was satisfied with this. The CD is hard to find so I didn't fuss too much. But I do think out of good business practice that a CD should be inspected to its fullest before selling it and if it has problems, then the consumers should be forwarned."
5,Faulty,"The product looks good when it arrived but before i could adjust the timing, its seems to have died and now i have to file for return...That i only rate a 2 stars. However, the customer service was prompt and efficient and i have no choice to give a 5 stars!"
3,Not very loud,"It's a jumbo size display, battery backup & a nice Regular clock but , it's no louder than any regular alarm clock that you'd buy anywhere. I was really disappointed. I put it on the dresser draws across the bedroom so i could see just how late I over slept. It has two volume settings, Hi & Lo. On low I can barely hear it even holding it in my hands. Now, the dog hates it so, maybe it'll wake him & he'll wake me trying to get to it.If your hearing imparted or a heavy sleeper, I advise you to go with one of the Sonic Boom clocks & not give this one a second thought. I gave it 3 stars for one...battery backup, one for large display & one for having a flip switch to shut off the alarm. Buttons are too easy to hit by mistake thinking you just hit the snooze button by itself & not both."
1,"Not datisfied, gun not what I needed",When I ordered the gun I was led to believe it would take the nails that I normally used in my old gun. To my surprise the nails would not load. Sent the gun back I have several boxes of good nails to use up. In today economy can no afford to discard the nails.
2,out of date and ...,these books look good but they are out of date and there is no website for support.
2,Pretty much crap.,"I bought this game thinking it would be kind of like a 3D version of Sid Meier's game. Little did I know this game would have ZERO replay value, little or no instruction, and crap graphics. Stay away. Far away."
4,Most Enjoyable,"Emma Lange has fast become one of my favorite Regency authors. Her research is always good (her degree is in European studies) and her characters never fail to captivate. This book is about Susannah, the daughtor of a duke, and Connor O'Neill, her grandmother's horse trainer who happens to be an earl going incognito for reasons of his own that have nothing to do with Susannah. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this book (and most of Lange's efforts) is that although there is some friction between the characters neither the hero or the heroine languish about saying to themselves ""I hate him/her!"" when they actually realize they feel quite the opposite. The tale is very sweet and the subplot involving Irish rebels is also quite well done. A good choice for any Regency fan."
1,Busted a year and half in with NO fix and NO support,I had this unit for about a year and a half before one of the ballasts went bad. Contacted the manufacturer and was told the ballast was discontinued. They gave me a link to a replacement so I ordered it and when it arrived it was a totally different size with a different wiring configuration. So now I'm out 200 plus the 40 dollar ballast. I contacted them again after this and was brushed off. Terrible product and equally terrible customer support!!!!!
2,I don't get it,"I've read enough of Sleator to be excited to find this book, but what a disappointment. If you've not read the first & great book, Interstellar Pig, or if you read it so long ago that it's not fresh, then the new book Parasite Pig just doesn't cut it. There are many references to the first book (something I find annoying: when a new title can't stand on its own as a full story). The writing is simple--I felt like Sleator was taking shortcuts, using fairly unimaginative adjectives to quickly advance a plot rather than to thicken the atmosphere. Yeah, if you're a sci fi buff you'll enjoy his techno speak and his creative story. But it's not a book to enjoy for the language; his writing feels like a means to the end."
3,"Average, illustrations ok, idea ok, text ok, Would have expected better","This is a simple story and would suit 4-8 year olds. It is picture book, the text is limited on each page but it is not easy to read, the font used is sans serif and it is a slim type so it is not easy for early readers.This is obviously meant to be an attempt to ingloriously represent the Queen, fine by me, but I just don't think it is done well. It has its funny moments, the knickers decorated with real holly, the jewel encrusted knickers, but it falls short of being genuinely funny by trying to be too clever.I didn't like the illustrations much, they are too naive and child-like. I love Helen Oxenbury style illustrations, or Maurice Sendak - those rich full pictures. The whole book feels thin and slightly inadequate.Its not that bad, but its just not that good either."
4,Perfect for the Administrator!,"I think this was related to an earlier APress book: Managing Enterprise Systems with the Windows Script Host, which I have. I was relieved to find it 'updated' with Exchange Server 2003 and Windows 2003 Server which is what I am working on now.I would recommend this to anyone who is an adminstrator. You can actually use it in your day-to-day tasks. I especially liked automating events like a reminder for the user to change their password after XX number of days."
1,not for apple powermac G5,This thing doesnt work with my powermac G5. will return to best buy and have to order another genuine apple adapter from here on amazon...
3,More fun than useful - dubious assumptions abound,"Jerry Lucky's approach to this complex subject is to give his opinion without backing it with facts, examples, or offering counterpoints. Some of his assertions are downright wrong and embarrasing, i.e. that contrived, pretentious, and self-indulgent are good things to be. Doesn't Lucky own a dictionary? Or does he choose it ignore it? A reader won't get any good information from this book. Compared to other writers on the subject, this fan's outporing is sophomoric, inessential, and unenlightening.I'm sorry to give a bad review to one of the few books on Prog, but this one is at the bottom of the heap. Read Stump, Macan, or even Martin for an intelligent assesment of the genre and its meanings."
5,Terrific read,"I have come to appreciate Niel De Grasse Tyson's clear writing in Natural History magazine. And I also had enjoyed Donald Goldsmith's Runaway Universe. They did not disappoint me with Origins.It is clearly written and provides a great summary of what we know about the Universe now. It also clarified for me a lot of topics which I had read about before but never really ""got"". An example is the curvature of space and how it relates to the expansion of the Universe.An easy read but with enough substance to make it worthwhile."
4,Origins a through non-technical review,Origins is a clear non-technical review of current knowledge presented in a clear concise format. It's content will be easily understood by all persons with enough education to be mildly curious about the Cosmic evolution.It contains all of the information presented in the Nova television series with supplemental exposition on key points the video did not have time to explore throughly.Origins: Fourteen Billion years of Cosmic Evolution serves as an excellent primer or review for more complicated and technicaly precise readings in the physics of Cosmic Develoment. No math is required nor any prior knowlege of physics to enjoy the content of this excellent work.
4,"Technical, but approachable--perfect for the curious hobbyist","Tyson proves that he is a great nonfiction writer yet again with this deep foray into the history of the universe. He breaks subjects down into logical chunks and only gets technical when it's called for. Still, any high school graduate with sufficient interest will have no trouble reading this book.I recommend the book to anyone who is more than passively interested in the history of the universe, the formation of the solar system, the planets, moons, etc. His treatment of these subjects is thorough enough for the layman, but not overwhelming.Tyson is probably the best writer and communicator in his field and this book is no exception."
3,A pretty good popularization,I've been getting so tired of Cambridge scientists and Harvard scientists talking down the nose about string or brane theory.This gives a good overview without a lot of strain .
2,Not very scientific,"The material presented is substantial, but something as simple as the phrase ""degrees Kelvin"" (which any science person knows is wrong since there are no ""degrees"" Kelvin) makes me wonder whether or not there are other mistakes like this one that I didn't catch due to unfamiliarity."
2,"2 1/2 stars, HYPERSPACE blows this away, and re-holsters","I love a good cosmic documentary, but this is a little dry. Didn't really get anything out of it. I watched Hyperspace again just to see if I had remembered incorrectly, but alas, it's still the best. I really hope someone is showing that doc to our kids in schools somewhere."
3,"Not great, but worth hearing at least once","Underrated 90s Motown singer combines tastefully restrained physical appearance of Patti LaBelle with energetic but never suggestive dance-pop of Janet Jackson. No-hit album ""Sweet As It Comes"" has well-produced if not terribly distinctive material. Best song (in my opinion): ""Watch Me Walk."""
3,2.5 Stars. Janet Jackson Lite,"Sounds a lot like Janet Jackson, with slightly weaker material, not quite as much attitude, and none of the promotion that Janet has had. If you like Janet, give it a try. Desperate Marketplace sellers make it easy and cheap."
5,Great Value. Great Fun,"Bought this ramp for my 11 and 13 year old boys. They love it and it is an essential to any teen age skateboarders ""home skate park"""
4,PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS,"GOT THIS FOR MY RC CAR & IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE. HIGH IMPACT PLASTIC SHOULD HOLD UP WELL FOR WHAT I'M USING IT FOR, BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL IT WOULD HOLD UP TO REPEATED POUNDING BY A SKATEBOARDER OF BICYCLIST SINCE IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF FLEX IN THE CENTER..."
5,Sweet!,"I use this with my Revo 3.3, hit this at full speed & get huge air! Arrived on time, solid ramp, takes a beating. Definitely will be getting another, don't need to, but for the price & quality of this ramp, two is better then one!"
2,It works for biking but not for skateboards,"the ramp works for bikes and if you have a platform connected to it scooters scrape it but if your looking to skateboard I suggest you invest in a stronger, larger but portable, MUCH MORE STURDIER, heavier but VERY MUCH worth it you should try a LANDWAVE or FRESHPARK ramp which is slightly more expensive but extremely worth itLandwave Single Skateboard RampFreshpark Mike V. Signature Pro Launch Ramp"
3,Good,"I've been using Alan Dworsky's ""Hip Grooves"" book for conga, djembe and cajon with good results, but the rhythms are quite limited (because the book comprehends djembe-style and conga-style drums/technique). I found out that djembe and cajon techniques are very similar (and that both instruments have 3 basic sounds), so any written material for one of them could be easily applied to the other. The material is very basic and simple and the explanations are very understandable. Successful results are almost inevitable."
5,Hip Grooves for Hand Drums,Great information with just the facts. Lots of single and poly rhythms without all the editorial opinion.
2,Not as helpful as you might think from the title,"My title summarizes my main disappointment with this book. It sounds great but when you get it, it seems to give relatively little in all those pages. Lots of filler, not enough content.I was especially disappointed with the notation. Although conga players use this chessboard notation, it's not standard in music generally, which means you can't show it to a drummer or the songwriter in your band and expect them to know what it means. Music notation exists for very good reasons -- it communicates rhythms with great accuracy. Letters in little boxes just don't."
4,Works as Intended,"I bought this to cut down an overgrown area of our lake lot. It works very good for stems about the size of my thumb and smaller. Small trees, wild grape vines, fountain grass, etc. didn't stand a chance. I tried to use it on diameters larger than an inch and it didn't really do a good job. But then, that's why they make loppers.One has to replace the string trimmers handle with a J-handle and it included a shoulder strap, both needed additions. They also include a hanger for what ever attachment isn't being used.Overall, I am glad I bought it."
2,Not very pleased,It took a long time and in the end it is weak and not sharp. That is what I don't understand at all about it it doesn't cut
3,"ok,not as good as without choc.","these are good, but stick together in the summer, not sure how you would receive in winter. I think I like them better without the choc."
3,Who Needs More Social Context?,"While a hefty and well-researched tome, F-F spends far too many words on what any half-literate student of American History in general, and the Civil War in specific, already knows. Volumes of individual soldier letters and diaries abound. The subject has been beaten to death--along with the home front. Likewise, the Emancipation Proclamation is its own cottage industry. So just tell me about the battle. Maybe 30 or 40 pages to set it up, then get on with the menauvers--the more detailed the better. Bottom line: Buy O'Reilley's"
4,"""IT'S NOT HERE!!!'","THE ORCHESTRA THAT PLAYS,""SEPTEMBER SONG"" IS NOT HERE! THEY HAVEPUT IN HARRY JAMES' VERSIONON THE CD. THIS IS BOGUS. THE MUSIC (26 TRACKS) ARE FROM 1927 TO 1949. IT'S GREAT OLD TIMECLASSIC AMERICAN MUSIC FROM SOME OF HIS MOVIES. I WOULD HAVE GIVENTHIS CD 5 STARS, BUT, THE ORCHESTRA THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR, ISNOT HERE ... I SHOULD SAY, THE MYSTERY ORCHESTRA. JOE BUSHKIN PLAYS IN THE LOWER REGISTEROF THE PIANO. BUT,""SEPTEMBER SONG"" FROM;""THE JOE BUSHKIN STORY"" CD IS NOT THE VERSION FROM THIS MOVIE.P.S. The search go's on . . . By the way,VIVA' UPPER-CASE LETTERS ! ! !"
3,Not too bad,I purchased this case for my Magellan Roadmate 2200 series GPS. And while the case does hold all of the components it is a little large and oversized. But heck I'm not complaining it gets the job done.
1,Wayyy overpriced,As of this date you can buy all the individual seasons for almostfifty dollars less than this 'collection' (which is just all the separateseason boxes).Always bugs me when they package a group of items and charge MOREthan it would cost to simply buy them separately
1,"Good DVDs, terrible deal","The show is great, and the sets are good packages. But I bought all 7 sets plus the movie for $85, or about $65 cheaper than this deal. Buy them separately."
3,"Maybe for an engineer, pictures suck",To get the most out of this book I think you would need some engineering background. I think the book works on that level. The pictures are absolutely worthless black and white with zero contrast. This would not be my first choice book on the subject...but I have to admit that I have not been able to find any good books on the subject.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this shoe in copper hoping that it would be a sassy addition to my wedding dress. Instead, the shoe turns out to look cheaply made. The metallic shimmer looks like spray paint on faux suede, and although the color does look similar to what's shown online, the spray paint is what throws off the shoe's appeal. It looks like the paint will start chipping off at first nick or scratch. Definitely not worth $80!"
3,Stackable Rings,Made in China. Base too small and tips too easily. Paint chips and comes off on adjacent rings. Bright blue ring is a dull dark blue.
1,A little quality control please!,"Wow, this arrived with TWO green rings -- the same size! -- and no yellow ring! Where is the quality control? Didn't the packager at Amazon notice this glaring mistake? What a disappointment. Feels cheap and smells bad, pass on this one."
5,Excellent,Got this for an 18-month old who absolutely loves it. Much more attractive than the plastic versions.
4,Nice stacker.,"This is a nice looking wooden stacker. The things you should know before buying are: The holes in the rings are all the same size and that the paint does chip a little. However, I still like it and my daughter has enjoyed it as much as any other learning toys we have. I really love wooden toys, but I'm not sure I would recommend this over one of the cheap plastic ones."
4,Great continuation of a story...,"While ""Dark Water's Embrace"" dwelled upon sexual preference and identity in a new and harsh world, ""Speaking Stones"" deals more with the issues that arise when two sentient species with wildly varying histories and cultures try to coexist. It didn't grab me quite as much as ""Dark Water's Embrace,"" the characters didn't tug at me *quite* as much, but it is still an outstanding book. Highly recommended, ecspecially to anyone who has read the first book and craves more of this ever-changing planet and society created so masterfully by Stephen Leigh."
4,Works Good! Right Price!,"So I got this seatpost rack today from Amazon... it's great, but I was ordering the one that was all aluminum, this one is plastic. But, anyhow, the quality is really good for a $30 seatpost rack. I was very impressed! I comes with some rubber spacers for the seatpost clamp, which I thought was pretty nice that they included them."
5,For those longer trips...,"I have a full suspension mountain bike and will go biking all day. This does great for securing my bag that is easy to just slide into the track and clip. When I don't go on a full days ride, I just unclip the bag and I am set to go. Its just easier then a lot of the other products out there that bungees around. All in all, I am very satisfied with this product. They also give you different sized rubber grips for different sized bikes. Works great."
4,Five O,"This is just what I needed, and it came just as advertised. Fits easily on the seat post, carries what I need, and serves as a mud-guard/fender as well. I especially like the way it compensates for hiding hide the seat-post mounted reflectors by providing a reflective back and a tail light mount too."
3,Plastic Bar Broke After a Month - Customer Service Very Good,"I love the concept of this bike rack since it allows one click fastening of Topeak bike bags. However, the plastic bar that the bag clicks onto broke after a couple months of regular use. Customer service sent me the replacement plastic piece immediately. The other racks in collection have metal fastening bars that will not crack like my plastic one did. They are more expensive, but you don't to risk failure of the part of the rack keeps your valuables from spilling on the road, don't buy this rack.Note: The plastic bar did break while installing the bag, not riding. But I don't want to have to worry about it breaking while riding on rough terrain. Normally, I would not buy any bar rack, but had no choice since I have rear suspension.Topeak makes great racks. This is not one of them."
1,Not good for sensitive skin...,I would consider my skin slightly sensitive. This product made my face SO DRY and I have the oiliest skin of anyone I know. I cannot imagine anyone wanting it for dry skin. It was awful...Made my skin look ten years older than I am.
5,Great for dry skin!,My skin is so dry but I also have blackheads on my nose- this takes care of both! My skin glowed after just one use and it smells amazing. I feel like I'm getting a spa treatment every day. I love the Dermalogica line but this is by far my favorite product so far.
4,"Effective, but not a quick fix","Seems to be working so far, but I haven't been using it long enough to make an informed review. Satisfied overall."
4,Used it for years,Dermologica is a quality product. THIS CLEANSER IS ONE OF THE FEW KAOLIN-BASED I've found. It has always been very effective.
4,Cooling and clearing,"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at a local retailer. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is not one of my main facial cleansers BUT I do like this one and would recommend it. I find that it's very good for the summer and has a cooling effect, which does a good job of cleansing and clearing impurities."
4,Wake up!!,"I like this dermalogica dermal clay cleanser, especially in the morning. It has a cool feel to it after you've washed your face. It makes me feel awake. I would definitely recommend trying this. Oh yeah, and it actually made my face feel smoother. It doesn't have any micro-beads or anything, but works great!"
1,Lousy Cane,"This thing might work for incredible short people. Not long at all, not made of wood, and the stick isn't even straight. Pretty much worthless. Don't waste your money."
1,Very cheap and flimsy,"Ok, i wasn't expecting a supurb product here but this is cheap beoyond belief. Flimsy plastic and balsa wood. I get that this is a ""prop"" but it is honestly something you'd buy at a dollar store. *AVOID*"
2,A little misleading,"I purchased this cane for my 16 yr old son to attend a theme wedding. I did note the measurements on the listing, but as the cane wasn't listed as a 'children's cane' I thought it would be ok. It wasn't, when they said 29', that's from tip to tip, this is definitely for a child, not a teen or adult. Also, the paint on the cane itself was very spotty, you could see the brown wood showing through. Don't waste your money."
4,Great Buy,"The cd that i purchased was, as listed, in great shape. The case had a very small crack, but the cd itself is perfect.I'm very pleased, and will order from this seller again."
3,not enough Scooby,"This is a cute movie but there is not enough Scooby in it to keep my two year olds attention. There is more ""Yogie Bear"" in this one than ""Scooby Doo"". We are die hard Scooby fans!"
1,XBOX Live Bundle fails to meet expectations,"The 3 months of XBOX Live is definitely a must have, though the headset is most definitely sub-par. I ended up throwing it away after a few days as the volume level was unresponsive and the mute button remained constantly engaged, even when it was supposed to leave an open channel. I would probably recommend biting the bullet and getting the wireless headset and getting a 1 year XBOX Live Gold separately for $49.99, that is a much better deal than this bundle.The only real bonus is the 400 points that comes with the package, I enjoyed being able to purchase some new downloads for Rock Band 2 without spending too much."
3,Xbox Live- Headset does not work,"The 3 three moth subscription worked well as did the 400 Microsoft points, but my headset echoes whatever the person I am talking to is saying. This gets very annoying and I cannot concentrate on the game."
2,You might not get what you ordered.,"I ordered this as hardcover used from Got Books Inc through Amazon's website (and have paper and emailed receipts to prove I ordered hardcover). They sent me paperback. Not cool. Pretty cheap, so not worth sending back. But I'm pretty annoyed right now. Just ordered a ""new"" copy hardcover from a different amazon seller. If this doesn't turn out right, this will be the last time. So not happy right now."
3,for windows 7 64bit users,"I've installed it on my laptop which runs on Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit.I got 1 problem. Everything works fine excepts ""END"" button.Everytime I have to click on ""END"" button on SKYPE application, not on this product.Whenever I click on ""END"" button on this product itself, I have to unplug and plug it in again.It is silly. I guess the driver doesn't support 64bit OS."
3,pretty decent,"It is a shame that the computer has to stay on. the voice quality is good on my end an OK on the other. But you can't really surf the web while talking or you will get bad connection. Cute and efficient design. Sometimes it freezes on the my Mac and I have to replug the USB line.For what it is, its good. I would have given it a four star but MYGEARSTORE annoyed me a bit. the first phone was defective and it is impossible to get in touch with them (feels like a one man operation). Must email them and be patient!"
3,Console activity (Mac OS X 10.4.7),"Love the phone but am finding that while it is plugged into the computer, the console is logging messages at the rate of around 10 a second (2 shown below):2006-07-02 16:18:53.433 free-1 USB Phone[89] AUDIO_IN AppleUSBAudioEngine::Free-1 USB Phone:3d100000:22006-07-02 16:18:53.533 free-1 USB Phone[89] AUDIO_OUT AppleUSBAudioEngine::Free-1 USB Phone:3d100000:1That's around 60kB per minute..."
1,NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"I bought this phone which has a lot of problems, including the fact that no one can hear me when I talk on it. Repeated attempts to contact customer service for a replacement have gone unanswered. I would not recommend."
3,Out of function during the call sometimes,"The design of this phone is very good, handset user interface and software driver are both easy to use and functional rich.After using it for a week. I found several annoying problems:- It has been very often that it malfunctions during call. Sometimes mic went dead, other times speaker went dead. So I had to drop the call, secure the cable, or replug, or give up and use an alternative. This bug is critical and annoying.- Its driver has functions to set the output device for skype and windows default. However, it seems have conflicts with windows own setting and other audio application. So sometimes I cannot let my music comming from notebook's speak, it goes to the handset no matter what I set.I bought it to use it as the only handset, but end-up with carrying an alternative all the time.Not recommended."
1,awful~~it is not made by IPEVO,"awful! I think that I was defrauded. From the photos and explaination of this product, it seems to ber made by IPEVO.Actually it isn't."
1,Wish I'd never ordered,All the pictures are black & White. Paper is not white making them very hard to see and captions are not funny.
3,Workman tries,"The original author does not seem to have been consulted much via these captions. I wonder why the editors seem to think they are so much funnier than Jim Edgar. Most of these captions remind me more of Bad Dog, which he did not work on at all. I hope in the future they consult the original author more."
5,"Sometimes, I laugh so hard I cry (and pee a little).",If you have a deep love for cats and have a warped sense of humor you will LOVE this calendar.
1,The World's Worst Calendar,"I love cats, which is why I bought this calendar, but I am going back to the regular Workman Publishing Page-a-Day. You cannot believe the poor quality of the paper and pictures. You have to strain your eyes to look at it. Keep away from this calendar and don't waste your money. Also, it's not particularly clever."
1,Bad Cat = Bad Humor,"I have had cats myself for over 15 years, and right now have three very amusing ones at home. That said, this is one of the least funny calendars I have ever seen, and you'll get more entertainment staying at home and letting your cats OD on catnip, believe me. I do have the book, and thought it was cute, although mostly for the pictures rather than the banter. I did expect this to be in B & W because one-a-days rarely come in color, but many of the pictures are not particular funny, regular cat shots (i.e. a head shot of a basic cat), of terrible print quality, and the quotes are awful. Very stale and lacking any sort of wit. The people saying this is hilarious are probably the types that think that ""Blue Collar TV"" and fart jokes are the epitome of high humor. So if you like basic, straight-forward comedy, by all means, get this calendar. I like more substance to my humor, and if you do too, pass on this. Even ""Cathy"" cartoons are funnier than this. *Gasp*"
1,Disappointing.,"Another reviewer had expressed disappointment that the pictures (unlike the cover) are in black and white. I didn't think this would be a problem until I got my own Bad Cat calendar. The day pages are of such poor quality paper that the resolution on the B&W photos is poor. There are captions (not particularly funny) with each picture that cover most of the rest of the page, so there is no space to make notes on the calendar, if that's what you want it for. Color me disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I am a regular buyer of the Cat Page a Day calendar. Don't buy this version. Really. Blurry pictures of cats in not too interesting poses. Comments below the pictures are not clever. Black and white. I am too lazy to return, but I hope to make a contribution by encouraging you to not waste your money. I used to regularly ""share"" the pictures of the cats in page a day, whether my coworkers wanted them or not, but I will not bother them with this em stuff.Who wrote this comment with astericks below mine in blue? I didn't. I am not sure what they mean."
1,Bad Calendar,"This calendar is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.The pictures are in black and white instead of color and some are very fuzzy with aweful captions that are far from funny. The rip off from this item is that it's not worth the postage to send it back. I thought of using it myself instead of giving it as a Xmas gift as intended. I decided I couldn't look at this thing every day. It would start my day off wrong. It's ashame that there isn't a lower rating like 0 and below. It surely woulld have gotten one from me.Don't be fooled don't buy this. You will be sorrier than me. After all,you were warned.Ann in Pa."
3,Ghan Train Trip Review,"While the DVD was quite informative, I considered that it lacked adequate content of the scenery during the train trip.It is also somewhat outdated as it does not address the extension of the route between Alice Springs and Darwin.DVDs of the updated Ghan train trip are available in the PAL format.An updated version of this DVD that would include additional scenery as well as the expanded trip to Darwin would be a useful tool to persons who planned to take to trip as well as a keepsake for persons who have taken the trip."
5,Great little product for that first-time sleepover,"This was a wonderful little DVD. We used almost all of the ideas on the DVD for my daughter's first sleepover. It was a huge hit with all of the tweens at her party. It's really not something I would use over and over, but for a first-time party idea, it was great, worth every penny I paid for it!!"
5,Storage Rack,The storage rack was smaller than I expected but very sturdy and ended up being the right size for the space I placed it in. It is very easy to put together. One person can do it and no tools needed. It is a great item and would buy it again if I need another one.
1,Like the rest. Defective. Buyer beware...,"I was really looking forward to this unit. In fact, waited for a few weeks for the unit to come into stock. The claimed features, price, capacity, and noise were the most competitive. Unfortunately, never worked as the bucket full detection always is on. Therefore, the compressor never turns on. Fan runs, but does not dehumidify even a drop. The manufacturing and design quality is very poor on the unit I received. Soleusair does not answer the phone nor return calls left on the ""customer support"" voice mail. Sorry Soleus, I bought a $183 65Pint Haier at Walmart that works and is designed much more solid."
1,Soleus Air CFM-65 65-Pint Low Temperature Portable Dehumidifier,"Did not even last one year. Leaked all over my carpeted basement floor. I understand the need to ship the unit back for warranty work, but the shipping costs are nearly the cost of a less expensive replacement. Customer service did not respond in a timely manner to my emails. I would not recommend this brand to others based upon my experience. This experience also reminds me of the perils of doing business over the internet versus local ""brick and mortar"" stores. With a local store, consumers have a better opportunity for service."
5,Excellent quick guide,"If you are looking for a comprehensive guide, this is not it. However if you are looking for quick concise answers on such topics as reflection, interfaces, inner classes, localization, you might be happy to learn that this book won't leave you high and dry. It depicts each topic with just enough theory and examples to get you on your way. The section on localization is very good if you wish to get a quick intro to localization. Reflection is also very nicely highlighted in this book. I wish I had used this book before I used reflection like maniac throughout my projects.Another cool thing about this book is the price. Under [priced]for a good Java book is something I really like given the fact that I buy books at an astronomical rate.Enjoy,Will"
4,Loosens up the old silicone caulk for easier removal. Biodegradable.,"I bought this to remove my old silicone caulking in the bathtub and floor. It is labeled biodegradable and much more less toxic than others on the market. It does have a warning to be careful when you use it next to a painted wall as you may want to test it colorfastness first.In regards to its effectiveness, I would say it does work somewhat that it helped me loosen up the silicone caulks around the tub and between the tiles. It will not dissolve the existing silicone caulk. What it does is it makes it easier to scrub off old one with the help of a caulk remover tool. Also, using a silicone glove, I felt that the remover penetrates the gloves into my fingers. Some of the leftover fragments silicone that were still sticking on the tiles, were also much easier to remove on the second pass."
3,Motsenbocker 411-45 doesn't remove silicone caulk very well,"With the packaging on this product reading ""Silicone Latex Caulk Remover"" I had higher expectations that it would do a good job, but I was disappointed. I removed the silicone caulking from my shower and had some difficulty removing the final thin film so that I could put on new caulking. I used this product as described, but found that it only did a mediocre job at helping to remove the remaining caulking. It did help remove about half of the remaining caulking, but it was still difficult to do so. It was better than not using the product at all, but didn't meet my expectations."
1,Not as Advertised,I bought this to loosen the thin film of silicone caulk that remained after I removed as much as I could with a razor blade. I left it on for 5 minutes and wiped it with a paper towel. No silicone removal noted. I reapplied and left it on for 30 minutes. Again no silicone removal noted. Tried for a third time leaving it on longer yet. This product did not work for me. It did not loosen the razor thin strip of silicone caulk that remained on the metal shower door frame or the thin strip on the fiberglass shower stall walls.
3,A winner if...,"If you like the Fabulous Wailers, The Sonics, Paul Revere and the Raiders and things like that, this will be a welcome addition to your collection. It is a crummy home-made recording and the skill of the musicians varies quite a lot. The songs are at times inventive, at other times boring. The energy however is high, and the ridiculous commentary (it is a live performance)brings a smile to the face of the ""right"" person. This cd reminds me especially of the newly released EARLY live Paul Revere and the raiders double cd called ""Mojo Workout"". I think that would be a much wiser expendeture of cd money."
5,best old school anime ever,nothing beats the classics... this old school one i Remember back in my jr high days. A show that keeps coming back with even better tales and story lines and not to mention the songs and the lovely animation. I am looking forward to the next one that comes out. And the comics as well
5,SLIM IS THE BEST!,"Sir William Slim is, in our opinion, the best general of WWII. He is also one of the very few military men to have a genuine sense of humor, and this book is the one of the most hilarious we have ever read. I believe that 'Unofficial History' may have, in fact, saved my life. I had had our first copy mailed to us in England when I came down with one of those horrid British upper respiratory things. My husband read excerpts from this to me as I lay suffering one night, and I laughed so hard and long that I immediately began to improve and thrive once again. Highly recommended...a warning, however, we continue to try to buy every copy available for gifts for all our friends!"
2,slow read,"I was looking for a more forensic view from this book. It is a repiticious tale of the fire was announced, we showed up fire and smoke was visible from the windows etc. It should have delved more into the actual documentation and description of evidence that was saved from the fire in my opinion. Also too much description of engine XX and truck XX Batalion XX for each call. Too much detail. I dont mean to demean the authors work but it was just a very slow read, like a story that never got off of the ground."
5,By far one of the best books I've ever read.,I've bought this book ten years ago and still now is my bible in fluid mechanics. The authors' writing is one of the best I've seen in engineering books generally. Congratulations.
1,how long has this been in someones basement ???,So I ordered this for s friend ..once recieved she told me the paint in the box expired in 1997 !??! Holy cow .she ended up throwing it all away bc they paint she has to go out and BUY didn't work
5,Rossi Black Olive Linguini,"This pasta is THE best! Our family wouldn't have our homegrown, homemade pesto with anything else. It is just spicy enough and doesn't overwhelm the pesto, but does add an additional ""zing"". It is strong enough to hold up for any topping. It's also excellent cut up and in a cold pasta salad. Use it anytime that you want pasta with some flavor of its own."
1,not trustworthy,"I bought this device for convenience, but it is erratic and not trustworthy. To get a proper reading one must be extremely careful in the least. Even then you can not be sure of the reading.If I did not know my normal BP from my doctor visits and using my arm cuff and sphygmomanometer, I would be very distressed by the wild readings it displays, even when carefully following the detailed conditions required for proper use. I do not recommend it."
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this 4-pack as a Mother's Day gift. Every year she needs new gardening gloves, but I don't think she'll need them next year. The part that is colored is fabric, and the white part is a thin, rubbery material which helps with weeding. She seems to like them, although I haven't used them myself."
5,Only the best cat book ever written! :-),Never mind the rants of people who think it's necessary to pick apart a simple book for children. Tibs is certainly more clever than they! Take a tip from the cat and lighten up!If you or your child love cats and suspect they know something you don't this book just might reveal a few secrets. Simply a MUST READ!
5,Clever Cat is Clever Indeed!,"Peter Collington has been our family's favorite children's author for many years. We always look forward to his next book and are never disappointed. CLEVER CAT is one of his best.Peter Collington's beautiful drawings and his tender stories make the world a nicer place. Please keep the book's coming, Peter. We love them all!"
5,Kids are smart. Lighten up!,"This is the funniest picture book I've ever read. This book is hilarious, and anybody who has ever owned a cat should be able to relate.I am amazed at the negative reviews. I think this book is perfectly find for children. Kids aren't stupid. They understand that in certain stories, characters are mean, stupid, or lazy for comedic effect, and are not meant to be imitated. Ever read The Stupids? A Series of Unfortunate Events? James and the Giant Peach? Not every children's book has to end with a lesson or a moral. How boring would that be?Give kids some credit.P.S. If you must have a moral, how about ""the grass is always greener""? I believe that could apply to this story."
1,Cute Book - Bad Morals,"The moral lesson behind this book it horrible. It basically teaches children that true cleverness comes when you figure out how to do the least amount of work as possible and that showing your true potential will just create hassles for you. And the worst part is that it delivers this message in a cute story about a cute cat with great illustrations.Also, the family treats the cats very badly, calling him stupid and dumb - words my 4 year old is not allowed to say. That is no way to treat an animal that you purposefully adopted into your home!I understand that some proponents of this book say that it is a look into the minds of cats but that is not how children's books work. All stories, no matter what creature or person is portrayed, is ""relate-able"" to the child. And I don't like the lesson this book is teaching to my daughter.I strongly recommend against this book! There are plenty of other cute cat book that teach much better lessons."
5,bloodsuckers rock!,"This 19th century novel is an absolute must have for any vampire fan, as well as academics interested in what our vampires say about us."
1,Gauze pads,A very poor product. Gauze pads are extremely thin and non-absorbent. It's easy to understand why the price is so low. However the product is not worth the cost no matter how low.
2,OK...,"They're ok I guess,but they're really coarse Chinese made gauze.I'm just using them to wipe off alcohol before a glucose stick so they work for that but are really cheap feeling."
3,"OK, but too thin","The product is OK, but much thinner than store bought 12 ply pads. With this product I need two to obtain the same absorbency as with a store bought product. This takes much of the price advantage away"
5,I'M A FAN IF GERALDS,THIS WAS ONE OF GERALD'S BIGGEST HIT OF HIS CD'S WELL!!!! I CAN ONLY SAY I HAVE ALL OF HIS CD'S AND FOR SURE I HAVE ALL THE MANHATTANS MUSIC .SUCH GREAT BALLADS SIMPLY GREAT HARMONIZING AND LEAD SINGINGAlways in the Mood
1,I've had my fun.,"Picked one of these up last week at a bingo parlor. It was fun for the first few days, but don't be fooled these so called beanie babys don't do anything. They don't make noise. they don't move at all. Now it just sets in the trunk of my car. I wish I could sell it for what I payed, but I doubt it's worth much."
4,Quality company and product,"Crescent has been in business for over 100 years and quality has not slipped even when ownership has changed. They use good quality materials and fair prices. This screwdriver has an ergonomic handle with cushion that really lets you apply torque when you need itto back out screws driven in by power equipment. Conversely, you can apply just the right amount of torque without breaking the screw when tightening. The square drive means the screw will hang on the screwdriver without needing to be magnetized. Good design and works as needed."
2,Unintentionally funny,"A snowboarding video that concentrates on carving technique. It's kind of funny in an unintentional way. The instructor reminds you of Rick Moranis who is ""instructing"" a largely wordless and expressionless blond woman named Shawna in dark sunglasses who is at least a foot taller than he is (Ok she's probably his wife or sister, but. . .). The film cuts away several times probably because Shawna is about to fall on her head. You keep expecting him to ask Shawna for a date, or for Shawna to whop him upside the head, but alas, most of the video is just watching them talk and Shawna carve. Not bad, but not very detailed or instructive."
1,pathetic,"These dorks waste 8 pages reassuring each other that they are cooler for never having dropped acid, focussing instead on record collecting and self-assigned reading programs to carry them through their late-60s adolescence.Then they go on to diss Silver Apples and Amon Duul. So very wrong."
2,Define Strength,"Define Strength is a good debut album for the band Unfisted, who had an album before that but its unreleased. The band has hardcore metal riffs with punk-like vocals. There are real good hardcore songs like ""Dawn Patrol"" and softer, more emotional songs like ""Who I was meant to."" The band is Christian but that doesn't stop them from making kick-... music. If you like bands like Helmet or Quicksand you'll love these guys."
4,Way cooler then Hunter: the Reckoning,For starters I would like to say I love Demon Hunter X and Kindred of the East. The only thing that keeps me from giving DHX 5 stars is the fact that and i've always felt the Shih warriors were too restricted as far as their starting Qiaos. Don't get me wrong they are very powerful but if you have a gaming group of Shih (for some reason) they are basically all going to be cookie cutter cut outs.I've always loved the focus on martial arts and fighting styles in DHX. Now SF0 is great it has it's own unique beliefs and execution methods for dealing with the Shen. On top of that it is the only Demon hunter type that openly makes itself into a group template which is ideal for most gaming groups.
4,Works for Me,I am not technically savvy but this works and was easy for me to hook up. I had an HD ready receiver so I needed this with antenna.
5,Use with onkyo sr705,i use this tuner with my Onkyo receiver. Its easier than attaching a inno though RCA.
3,Works but issues getting it to work,"The Mini Tunner couldn't be refreshed over the internet.Had to call and stay on hold with XM for about twenty minutesOnce it was on, it worked fine"
3,Accurate measure; Sharp edges.,"The measure I received is indeed equal to 1/8 cup (2 Tablespoons). I verified it against my standard 1/4 cup measure. But it is made of the thinnest steel I have ever seen. As a result,the edge of the cup (which is not rolled or smoothed in any way) and the edges of the handle seem sharper than I like; it also feels like the thin metal could bend out of shape with very little effort.Interesting fact: this measure has two little pour spouts on the sides of the cup.I purchased it as a 1/8 cup measure for baking, not for coffee. It is very lightweight. I don't really like it, but I'm questioning if it is worth the postage to send it back to Amazon."
1,Inaccurate measurement,"This cup is closer to 1 tablespoon than 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup). I am surprised the retailer continues to sell it, as they have already been notified of the inaccuracy of the product's measurement."
3,Coffee Measurer,This measurer does the job but is a little flimsy. I wanted stainless for my old fashioned jars. This works but would prefer something that held up better.
3,Perlman and Zukerman Grand Duo,"This program is from a set that includes a number of films done by Christoper Nupen and Allegro Films in the UK in the late 60's and Early 70's tracing the early careers of Perlman, Zukerman, Baremboim and Du Pre.Unfortunately this program seems to be out of print everywhere, though I have seen it only from an airing on cable tv.This Film focuses on a performance given by Perlman and Zukerman in London and is a film documentary of the concert with a short introduction narrated by Christopher Nupen.In the way of criticism, I felt the camera angles in this one weren't always great which detracted from a good presentation of repertoire not often heard or seen on video. Far too many close up shots of the performer's faces are not very revealing to those wanting to see the performers playing.It's worth having for your ""Zukerman/Perlman"" collection, but not the greatest example of these two in performance."
4,We all have bad habits,Mine is that i'm a sucker for good lyrics! This collection of sounds is one of the few things that could make a person nostalgic for the 80's. Glam rock combined with sensitive writing. If you were a fan of music such as Toto and Styx then Its worth digging up a copy of this album!
1,One of the worst books I've ever read...,I seriously think I must have read a different book than all of the other people who rated this. The only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I never leave a book unfinished. I did end up flipping through it pretty quickly though so that I could move on the something more interesting. The story seemed to be at a stand still the whole time; it went NOWHERE. It was totally boring and a complete waste of time!
5,"great book, a must read.","I was in 4th grade when this book was read to me by my esl teacher, I was stunned by the story to say the least. I didn't know if it was fact or fiction but does it really matter? There was no good reason to drop that bomb, the Japanese goverment was going to surrender, and they did because Russia decleared war on Japan, not because of the bomb."
1,Over priced -,To be forced to buy a proprietary SD card for a Garman is ridiculous. Any SD card should work. I feel cheated to have to spend twice as much for a nearly identical product.
1,Lousy,"A more accurate title for this book would probably have been ""A small fraction of one version of the Rite of Memphis"". Even as a rehash of documents available elsewhere this book is vastly incomplete. What is even more angering than the editor's consummate lack of skill as a researcher or writer is the audacity he has to charge so much for a thin paperback book which verges on being a pamphlet. This is unforgiveably bad, and does not deserve even a single star but you can't give reviews lower than that."
5,Great Photos,"Although this book contains ""only"" 224 pages, it seems to be much larger. Some of it may be due to the larger format (9""x11""). Most of it may be due to the excellent large (full-page and two-page) photographs. The accompanying text is concise, easy-to-read yet very informative. The photographs cover many aspects of vineyards and workers. The books does a good job covering the various areas of the U.S. and provides a surprising amount of detail about history and current status of each."
5,Gulistan Rug,Excellent choice on my part. The rug is very well made. the wool from New Zealand appears to be of a high quality. Looks good on the floor and is wearing well.
5,Very pleased,"I just recieved my rug today. The colors are beautiful and the quality is much better than I expected. It is also much thicker/plusher than what I expected and the texture is quite soft when you walk on it barefoot. I am very pleased. I commend Amazon because UPS initially lost my order in transit and when I called Amazon, they immediately responded by sending me a replacement rug. I recieved my replacement within 2 days. Kudos to Amazon! They responded in an extremely professional manner and I was quite impressed with the quality of their customer service..Bravo!!"
2,Looks great ... But...,"I purchased this few days and was delivered on-time. It looks slightly different from picture but for better. Colors are sharp and design is beautiful. Picture does not do justice.However, it loses lot of woolen fibres/hair on daily basis. Everytime I vaccumm it, my vaccum bag would have a bunch. I do not know if its normal for wool carpet but it worries about the fact what is going to happen to this in next few months?"
2,lacking important features,"I bought this system 10 months ago, and initially I was pleased... simply because it was a big step up from what I had before. That's not saying much, though. I would strongly advise others to purchase a different system. I can't comment intelligently on sound quality, but this home theater in a box lacks some basic and important features:No random, which is bad if you are just listening to music.No zoom.You also can't continue to play a disc while changing others. You also will lose your spot if you attempt this.Oh, and mine stopped working... that's the main one.Guess I was naive and expected more from sony."
2,Average System,"Average system. I was happy when I brought it, especially because of ease of setup and also as I own a Sony TV, I can operate with one remote.Points to consider before you buy1. Not very many inputs and outputs. (If you want to route audio of multiple system like TV, computer, audio systems you have to keep switching wires same with video if you have a TV and a projector).2. The DVD changer is a bit on the slow side.3. No zoom, which is annoying some times4. The sound is OK not very great."
4,Simple but strong,"This is a good simple system. Sound and volume are excellent. FF and REW functions are very weak. Main problems are in design: the remote is difficult to use, the unit's display is unreadable.Overall, an excellent value."
3,good sound / poor features,"Well, I just hooked up my system. The sound is great, but I was really disappointed with the lack of audio inputs (there is only one stereo input). I mostly wanted the system for SRS for my Xbox, but I can't hook that up.So, if you only want to use these speakers with the DVD player that came with the system, then go for it -- good speakers, great price! If you were hoping to hook up other components, though, forget it."
2,didn't work for me,"the movie had the right ingredients, but didn't quite make it home. of course tomei is pretty and and is a good actress. o'reilly doesn't have the looks, but is a fair actor and has the common guy personality and mannerism that's easy to relate to. the movie length may have something to do with my dislike--i really thought the movie was onto something, and when the credits started rolling at the end, i was thinking, ""oh... THAT was the movie?"" it really could have been up to a 4 star movie. the irony was that although it was short in length, it felt very slow, which i wouldn't have minded had the movie taken off from there. nice plot, but i don't know these people giving 5 stars."
3,"Bizarre, but good!","While the film was bizarre and at times, too awkward to watch. It was overall a good movie. A good renter if your looking for something to watch."
4,Great Awkward Moments,"This is such strange material that all the actors have to be at the top of their game to pull off. Man meets woman. Man begins to obsess over woman. But her 21 year old son already has a lock on that role. Some wildly inappropriate mutual sabotage is bound to follow. The funny thing is, you instantly sympathize with all 3 of these characters and simply want them to yell at each other to air it all out."
4,Bizarrely entertaining,"Except for the somewaht unexpected feel-good ending, this darkly bizarre study of a dysfunctional mother-son relationship was quite funny, though not in a laugh-out-loud way. The human facial expressions, the silences, the glances, the puzzled looks, the halting conversations, all make for the subtle humor we see here. And, of course, the many unflattering closeups of all three stars are also very funny, in their own way. This is not a typical Hollywood comedy, and many may not even get it. Well worth watching, though."
2,"Not worth seeing,, I suggest passing on this one","I just watched this movie and thought I would take a second to post that it is not a great movie, do not waste your time. It is not awful or anything but it is not that funny and it is one of those movies that you keep waiting for something to happen but it never really goes far. There is good actors and acting in this but they did not use them to the fullest by any means. It is flat and a bit slow. Anyways, for anyone who is not sure to buy or watch I would say pass if your anticipating serious humor or a fast acting movie."
3,Somewhat disappointing dark comedy,"One shouldn't be misled by the trailers the marketing people pushed out there to get people into the theaters. This isn't a funny movie even with John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill. They play rivals for the affection of Molly played by Marisa Tomei. The problem is one is the suitor (Reilly) and the other is the son (yep, Hill). Frankly, I didn't have a big problem just because there weren't any laugh-out-loud jokes or antics. What I did have a problem with is that a dark comedy should have a few chuckles or at least whimsical smiles in there somewhere. The story feels real for the most part but its brooding tone just didn't entertain me much. It's only 90 minutes long so I can't totally dismiss it, but it was a disappointment."
2,Not a comedy,"This movie has the set up of a classic sitcom. Divorce guy meets attractive woman who takes care of almost 30 year old, son, who acts like a teenager. A classic recipe for comedy. The trailer of the movie shows the movie to be a fun comedy like Step brothers. If you think that this is the case: You are wrong. The movie actually tries to be a drama with some funny scenes in it. The work of every actor in it, is actually pretty good but the story is weak. The choice to make this a drama really hurts the movie. If this movie was a 100% comedy I think it would've work. But unfortunately the p.r. people prefer to entrap the audience with a deceitful trailer. My recommendation is to rent and not buy, unless you are a hardcore fan of any of the people involve in the movie."
2,big let down,B-O-R-I-N-G!Rented this On demand b/c of the high ratings. It wasn't good. Very boring and uneventful movie. Wouldn't recommend
1,waste of time,"What a weird movie! I thought it would be funny because of the cast, but it was just a waste of time and money."
2,not what you expect,Not a funny movie. Still hit the mark because it wasn't intended to be... Acting was good.. gave 2 stars b/c it was marketed as a funny movie and I think that's BS.. If you're expecting something similar to anything you've seen from John. C or Jonah you will be disappointed.
1,worst movie i have seen in a long time,"absolutely terrible , simply the worst movie in a while.it proves that you may have the comedic talent but without good direction / writing it is worthless.camera work as i see it is supposed to enhance a movie this was distracting and off putting.in a nut shell strong comedic cast very poor direction / writing. I for one will steer clear of anything the duplass brothers do in the future."
1,Nothing humorous in this movie. Avoid it.,"This was like Psych 101 in enmeshed families. Not one likeable, mature or interesting character of the 3 main people."
1,Not Funny,"This movie was not funny at all. I laughed maybe twice in the beginning, then it was a struggle to get through to the end. Very disappointed. Only reason I finished the movie was because I paid to rent it. I am surprised at how many good reviews this movie received. I do not recommend at all."
1,Horrible,"I'm a big fan of all the cast members, but there was nothing funny about this movie, nor was there anything interesting or entertaining."
4,Serious issues,"John C Reilly got all the attention, but it's Jonah Hill who kicks butt as the ""mama's boy from hell"". It's certainly a low-budget Indie effort, but I applaud all involved; Marisa Tomei plays a woman at wit's end, Reilly plays a loveable schlub, and Catherine Keener watches it all from afar as if nothing could be more fun.It's a new take on an old story, except the ""kid"" is in his 20's. I enjoyed the film; some clever banter.Reilly got some award recognition, but it's Jonah Hill who makes it all interesting.I'm glad I rented it, but wouldn't buy it for future viewings."
4,Amusing,"Good acting by John C. Reily. Jonah Hill also makes a good appearance. If you like quirky comedies, this will be right up your alley."
3,Comic fans might like this,Tame stories with some decent artwork and few stories that actually entertain. Really a disappointment.I prefer Not Brand Echh or reprints of EC Mad stories.
2,101 Zen stories,"nice little book but the typo is appauling its from an old type writer, makes the reading not so pleasant."
5,great photos/ good calendar,"As always, Browntrout has come out with fine photographs and I always buy this planner about this time of year..and have been very pleased for about the last 5 or 6 years."
5,Enjoying The Week With Westies,This calendar brings joy to me everyday. I look at the pictures of the Westies and smile.
2,Batman has lost it.,"Beause that's the only way he's going to leave the batcave dressed in that. I don't understand why Mattel keeps force-feeding its consumers these ridiculous variant repaints. And even if you are going to present a variant, at least adhere to the stasndards of the Dark Knight. The other variants such as the night patrol Batman are actually quiet good. Don't buy this for yourself or for you kid. No matter, how young they still know Batman is not gonna dress like that. It's gonna wind up on the bottom of the toy bin."
1,Crud,Batman doesn't wear purple. A metallic shiny logo won't help him blend into the shadows. Horrible. F
2,Not good quality,"The Good:*Starts easily*anti-vibration handle*plenty of power for around the yardThe Bad:*This saw worked great for about 1 hour, then it started to have problems. It would not start, and I had to bring it in for a warranty repair. The shop had to replace a major engine part. They had some choice words for the McCulloch brand since they have been taken over by MTD. They said they now get numerous problems with these saws.*The Bar oil also leaks out of its tank unless you vent it after every use by opening the cap and closing it again.*Now the bar is not getting oiled properly, and yes I have the adjuster screw set properly.Overall, I would never buy another MC saw again. Maybe I just got a defective unit, but my 1 year warranty is now up, and I am stuck with a problem ridden piece of junk. Total hours of use: maybe 2"
3,NOT ANY BETTER THAN OTHERS,"I have had three other chain saws, a craftsman, a poulan and another unnamed. I thought by the reviews that this would be much better than the ones I have had in the past as I was looking to step up to a much better saw. Iwas very disappointed as this is no better than the previous ones I have had. I am also not happy because it keeps throwing the chain, a problem I have never had before. Not worth the extra money."
2,Not the quality I was hoping for,"I have owned these knives for almost four years, and frankly wasn't overly impressed with them from day one. They are triple riveted as one would expect from a blade bearing the Wusthof seal. Unfortunately though, the Wusthof bloodline is only skin deep. The Wusthof emblem itself is only a sticker affixed to the handle as opposed to having it embedded as in their other product lines. The steel is very soft and is very easily bent, particularly the steak knives. I've since replaced the majority of these knives with Forschner knives, which are more affordable and some of the best knives I've encountered."
5,Richard is the best!!!!!!!!!,"Richard's workouts are very awesome, he is very incouraging and helpful. Just like most of his videos, he always has the everyday kinda person in them, all shapes and sizes, and thats a big incouragement. This video I think out of all the sweatin to the oldies, is the best, it's very energetic and makes you really sweat, but yet you feel really good after the workout, not like most that make you feel exasted! Richard is just the best! I know he is helping me through a tough time with my weight and i'm slimmin down wonderfully! Good luck to everyone and don't feel hopeless, keep it up and you'll get where you need to be!!! GODDESS BLESS!!!!!!!!"
4,Blast from past,I used to work out to this all of the time when I was a kid. I bought it to lose some weight. Love it.
4,Best Sweatin video,"While I've decided dvd is much better than VHS - can easily skip songs to fit schedule - this is one of the best of the several ""Sweatin"" exercise routines that Richard Simmons has done. The moves are easy to learn and I like most of the songs."
4,Wonderful music and a great workout!,"Usually I'm not that incllined to do exercise. In fact I despise it. But I absolutely love this tape! Not only is Richard Simmons and inspiration to all of us that need to lose a few pounds, he really can get his groove thang on! The music is totally contagious and the workout is great. It isn't too hard but it also isn't too easy. You really do get your heart pumping with this tape. Plus you get to sing along with the music. The only ting Richard doesn't explain is the heart rate and what your target should be. Perhaps it is in the other tapes, but if you only own this one, check into what your target heart rate should be. Otherwise start sweatin to the oldies!"
3,Saved by glucose syrup,"The flavor is partially saved by the added sugar, but adds more proclivity to get stuck in your teeth. Got these at a steep discount & still wouldn't buy again at that price point."
1,Dry and tasteless...,"This bar is from a company in the UK, which is interesting because this is pretty much how I remember all their food tasting when I last visited. A chunky, crunchy texture with an odd amount of soft pockets as you bite through is completely ruined by the strange sweetness that arises from whichever ingredient is holding the bar together. Too dry, too many strange textures that just seem the result of sitting on a shelf too long, probably won't please most people unless you've completely given up on fat, sweet or savory flavors in your diet."
1,Pure fake,"Driven by the shipload of 5 stars I bought this CD (actualy I bought 2 taking ""advantage"" of a combined offer) hoping to get something that could compete with This Mortal Coil, say Cocteau Twins or Dead Can Dance. It doesn't compete at all: it's a pretentious insult to the whole movement!As one said, pure cliché. On ""Mesmerized by the Sirens"" some lyrics are in French - I guess because it's a ""chique"" language - and, living near France, I can assure you that your Spanish is better than this.I used to wonder why this ""frozen beauty"" wasn't available in Europe... That seems pretty obvious now."
1,Remnants of Dignity in Question,"I, too have read so many glowing reviews of this band Black Tape For A Blue Girl. I was so very excited to find American Gothic bands supposedly in the vein of 4AD. This band sounds like what Circe Nightshade and Azrael might come up with after a weekend on Ex-Lax and near-beer. Maybe not that exciting. If you like drivel, buy it."
4,A Low-Key Masterpiece,"I first saw clips from this film as part of a documentary on Olivier, and have been waiting for it ever since. I was by no means disappointed. It is definitely low-key and character-driven. Its bravura performances (especially those of Olivier and Bates) lie in the details and conviction. It's a great last teaming for Olivier and Bates, who also played a highly memorable father and son in the film of ""The Entertainer"". A must for connoisseurs of fine acting."
5,Great workable info ..,"I have played lotteries for more than 18 years, learning a lot along the way. This book is one of the best I have read. It is no-nonsense, direct, easy-to-read info...without marketing and sales deceptions."
1,Question for the readers above,"Before buying this book ask yourself this, did the reviewers above actually win the lottery after buying the book and why isn't every PHd in Mathematics and statistics doing the same thing. Please buy a book on basic statistics before buying this book. there are no secrets no clustering just randomness. You will lose 50 cents on average for every dollar spent.Save you money instead of buying what is a piece of garbage."
1,Save Your Money,"This book does not help you win the lottery. While there are strategies that can help improve your odds of winning, this book does not do a good job explaining them. In fact, you can get better tips and strategies on lottery information website, for FREE. This book was a huge waste of money. Save your money and check out lottery information websites like [...]. At least if you aren't happy with the information provided, you didn't waste any money!"
4,Smart solutions and easy to analyze,"Professor Jones writes an easy to follow book that can increase your odds of winning. His positional analysis and sum total strategies are excellent tools, and tha fact that he has a degree in statistics give him more clout."
5,LIVE AT THE TALK OF THE TOWN,"I believe I have purchased 5 of this album, having worn them out. Finally, I have it on CD!! It is timeless, from 1969. You feel like you are there!! It is one of their best Live albums/cd's. Obviously I am one of their fans!! It is worth purchasing.ENJOY!!Vince"
5,the toast of london,how fantastic finally i got hold of a copy of' live at londons talk of the town' this proberbly diana ross in her best vocal ever i was tranported back to the 1960/s. Faboulous show the same show is avalable on dvd titled live in amsterdam keep them coming.
4,Really good,Really useful for those who are already starting learnig greek (like me). You won't miss it.
4,Jonathan Edwards at his Finest,This book is clearly written so that anyone can distinguish between the work of the Holy Spirit and the spirit of this world
4,Good for you toaster tart.,We have tried several of the flavors of the Health Valley Low-Fat Tarts. We love the strawberry and blueberry so we thought apple would be a winner too. The flavor is great and my kids love them. The only complaint I have with them is that they are even more fragile then the other flavors we have tried. I have had to do surgery on my toaster a couple of times with these apple tarts.
4,"Great Book, Great General","A well written, balanced biography of George Thomas one of the most underrated tactical generals of the American Civil War. Because of his Virginia birth he was shunned by his family for his ""treachery"" in remaining with the union but for the same reason was considered as of suspect loyalty by some northerners, most especially politicians. Solid describes his physique and his character. He his stand on Snodgrass Hill saved the Union army at Chickamauga. Although he was idolized by his men, he was often treated shamefully by U.S. Grant who always tried to make his favorites (Sherman and Sheridan for example) appear in the spotlight but the man never wavered in his support of the union."
4,Good Biography of George Thomas,"I have always been a big fan of George Thomas. His great stand at Chickamauga obviously established his reputation as a great defense general, but what his troops did at Chattanooga and his obliteration of Hood's army at Nashville on the offensive are equally impressive.Cleaves does a great job of describing Thomas' early years. He also makes a good case for Thomas' progressive views about slavery and African-American soldiers. Cleaves describes Thomas as a humble, diligent, modest soldier.My one criticism of the book is how Cleaves portrays the relationship between Thomas and Sherman as slightly strained. I have not seen this documented in other places."
2,series of anecdotes,"There were some amusing anecdotes and observations of some of the crazy nightlife in Manhattan. It was misogynistic at times, particularly with using ""pickled clam"" as an anatomical description. The book did not seem to be edited and was sprinkled with baffling words."
5,Gimme a drink!,"I really liked this book a lot. The author has a great eye and a sharp pen. After reading it, all I wanted to do was go get a drink -- at his bar. You know that this guy is a seriously great bartender. He just has so much integrity. It comes out in the book. It's a very fun read. And it'll make you want to order a Negroni or Manhattan next time you're out. It gives you a whole new perspective on socializing at the bar."
2,CRANKY & DROLL,"Cecchini should have gotten out of the business years before writing this book. Yes, he has a knack for using big words in hopes of bringing this book to a more literary level, but he should have stuck to finding better stories instead. As a regular at two bars in Los Angeles, I have personally seen funnier and more interesting moments than Cecchini. He's so hard-boiled and tired that he barely seems interested in his own anecdotes. I don't mind bitterness, in fact the more the better, but without a sense of humor in telling the story, he doesn't make this a fun read. My fantasies of bartending are shattered forever. Fun as a concept, not so fun (or interesting) to read."
2,Not for the girls,"This book was a huge disappointment for me. I found his macho take on bar culture non-observant, but too critical. Anthony Bourdain wrote a rave about a book that discourages smoking in bars??? The guy is never shown without a Marlboro hanging out of his lips. I found this book pretentious and at times monotonous. The cover is fun, but it is not representational of the work."
2,Trying too hard but gets an E for Effort,"I love memoirs and when I had heard some buzz on this book I went ahead and picked it up. I read it fairly quickly and when it was over I felt down and unsatisfied. Cecchini's writing tries too hard to be literary and isn't straightforward enough. A lot of big words that seem out of place for a book about nightlife and booze. The cover made me think it would have been a lot more fun about a business that seems glossy and glamorous. Unfortunatly, Cecchini seems to think it was a drag one time too many - it wouldn't be an understatement to say that he's a little hard-boiled in the way he tells his story.Definitely a great atmosphere book, in that the place seems real but the customers act like jerks and who wants to hang out with jerks? Just wish it was more fun, is all."
2,pretentious moi ?,"I bought this book thinking it would be as great as ""kitchen confidential"" by anthony burdainWhat pretentious language ! Cecchini never uses a small word where an obscure one will do which makes for an annoying read ... ""heavily bibilous"" for example I guess he means drunk ...when I read windy sentences like ""I was relieved of my obligation of politesse of any kind"" I think ""hey Buddy get over yourself ! ""this book needed the heavy blue pencil of an editor"
3,Force armor?,"Force armor? in my opinion it more closely matches Gaea Armor.I'd say this one is fairly good but could a lot better. the helmet and shoulders look a bit ugly. also it doesnt take much to pop the leg off as with many other megaman toys. you can just stick it on again however, the detail is incredible from the heavy duty plates to his eyes.the shin gaurds match the game perfectly.good articulation. the bigget problem was really the leg wich kept me from giving it 4 stars"
4,50's at their best,These songs are a must of a rock and roll person. I have listened to these for years and you must.Rap and other music follow this pattern but fail to match up. To put this in your album collection will make you a trul listener. The roots of Rock are found here.This might be a little to Pop for some but a solid base to rock must have a start. These cuts are some of the best.Start your Rock and Roll with a big bang. If you don't have these cuts get this one.
1,Bell Rack Did Not Ring My Bell,"This product was very difficult to install (and we are both very handy people). My husband and I gave up and are shipping it back. The instructions were no help at all, not were the accompanying pictures. In addition, there are supposed to be 3 sets straps and hooks. There were 3 sets of straps but the middle set had no hooks! When we called customer service, we got an outgoing message saying they are only in on Monday through Friday. I have my first triathlon coming up, I can't be futzing around with this thing. My advice? Don't buy this product if you are looking for something easy to install and responsive customer service."
2,Sturdy on car but bike fasteners broke,"I bought this specific rack at Walmart, and the straps work excellent and the rack to car mounting was very sturdy on my 2007 Honda Civic with spoiler. However I had to return the rack because one of the rubber loops that the straps pull through broke while I was tightening the strap that holds the bike down. Very poor construction on the bike to rack straps. Should have been made with metal and have rubber only for cushioning, not entirely rubber."
2,Nice idea/bad design,"This 3 bike trunk-mount rack from Bell Sports is well constructed and stable when on the car (or mini-van as I did also) but the separation of the 2 bars on which the bikes mount are too far apart. It was virtually impossible to mount smaller road bikes (adult bikes, not kids bikes) in the conventional manner - through the main triangle. The bikes I was carrying where sized from medium to small and had aero carbon tubing making the space within the triangle but still, 2 inches narrower and it would have worked."
4,Good value; Very handy,For the price this is a great buy. Easy to install once you figure it out the first time. Folds up in a stap to toss in the runk when not in use and seems pretty sturdy. We do use a couple of bungy cords to further secure the bikes as there is some movement without them. We use for two bikes instead of three and I would probably upgrade if we wanted to carry three bikes.
3,Strong Rack but tough to setup,This bike rack is strong and feels secure when it's set up but the actual setup is tricky. I have a sedan and the side straps don't work on the side of the trunk (they'll just slip off) I put both the side and lower straps on the lower part of the trunk and pulled them tight- this seems to work well. I drove a couple thousand miles with the rack and had no problem. It folds for storage- which is nice.
4,Worth the money,"I have a volkswagen beetle, and this truck rack fits well on my car. We used it for a 4 hour car ride with two adult bikes and didn't have a single problem. Well worth the money."
5,"This is ""The Batman""","Well, everything has been said, this is the best Batman action figure, it looks just like in the comic book and the cape is cloth, not plastic, you can trow away the stupid weapon that comes with it and just have Batman by himself. The details and paintjob are preety good too. Worth every penny :DCool!"
4,Full of magic and superstition,"Once I got used to the magic and superstitions in this book, I really enjoyed it. The writing is discriptive and beautiful, and often more than a little funny. Although at times sequences were a little hard to follow,especially in the beginning it is well worth reading on. One of my favourite scenes in the story is the birth of Ruthie, the unwanted child. Her reluctant exit from her mother's womb is both funny and poignant. I laughed out loud at Marina the maid and Dorothy, Flora's unflappable friend. But lest it sounds like this book is only comical, I should add that it is full of life in all it's forms."
1,Dull,"If you are into lots of empty flowery words with no strong story or interesting characters then perhaps you will enjoy this book, otherwise stay clear. Overall impression, this book is merely colorful waffle. Very disappointing."
1,"Nice, but not the best quality","The idea for the product is pretty nice. Just poorly executed. For one, it's advertised as being able to be used with up to 3 transmitters. It comes with one extra transmitter, but no one sells the other transmitters. I spent almost two months in contact with the manufacturer trying to get an extra transmitter.In addition, the original product I received would not recognize the transmitter that came with it. I had to return it. The second one worked great. However, the batteries only seem to last about a month in both the transmitter and the receiver. The instructions say you should change the batteries once a year, but it only lasts about a month.I finally received a second transmitter from the manufacturer, but the receiver will not recognize it.It's a great idea. But just doesn't work well. And trying to get extra transmitters is almost impossible."
2,Poor Outdoor Performance,"This works well for indoors but I do not recommend its use for outdoors. We even placed the sensor in a sheltered area outdoors but no good. After about 2 months, the outdoor reading stayed at 130 degrees F."
2,Poor quality,"Got for Christmas, already the outdoor unit has went bad.For service, you must mail the company, wait for an RMA#,then send the unit back for replacement.Yea, thats timely... :(spend alittle more for a better unit."
3,Good product,"Although it does show you the temperature inside and out and the humidity, the first set of batteries I put in drained instantly, I am hoping they were just poor batteries, we will see. Also the accuracy in the book says plus or minus 4 degrees, that is quite a bit so don't count on it being totally accurate but it will give you a general idea."
3,Very difficult to set up without the manual,"Somewhat better than the cheeper version because of the weather forecast, however it is frequently inaccurate.Temperature does not match other thermometers I own, and always shows 1.5 C degrees higher than others.Not possible to set up the gizmo after battery change without the manual - DO NOT LOOSE IT!!!!Frequency used by this is the most popular in the world of wireless home products which means it will interfere with wireless chimes, alarms etc.Short range - does not reach the remote if placed on the other side of the house (approx 12 meters).Humidity level does not show at low temperatures: 4C and below.At temperatures 4C and below weather forcast shows snow only, all thoughout the winter, even if the sky's been sunny for weeks on end."
4,good but nothing new,I love Chynna's work and am addicted to blue monday but this title is actually a prequal to inbetween days and just furthers the tension between clover and victor. Its not essential but still a good read.
5,Introduce your kids to Jimmy Buffett's imagination,I haven't read this myself but I've read all of Jimmy's novels and his autobiography. I figured his children's books would inspire the same imagination for kids that his other books have done for me.The twins' mom tells me that the girls love it.
2,"Story can't figure out its audience, or whether it is realistic or fantasy","What a mess! This story has identity problems all over the place. It is produced in picture-book format but is too advanced and too long for a picture book, but too short and not developed enough for a chapter book. It is written in realistic style, but dolls are alive and birds speak and everyone can hear them; the housekeeper just picks up the girl's pillow and there's village of dolls. The housekeeper also lets the 9-year-old girl go out in her skiff to search for her missing father even though there is a big storm coming, ""because the trouble dolls would guide her well and keep her safe."" Why didn't the dad take them, then?? Magic isn't taken far enough to make an alternate world, and the dolls and talking animals are simply incongruous in ours. I enjoyed that the Guatemalan trouble dolls slipped in and out of Lizzy's map, but in general this was a mish-mash story."
1,Sad,"Though the book is a well written account of an African immigrant's experience, I was dismayed to find that the author bought into a lot of the stereotypes of African Americans and Africans. Check out Morehouse and Howard universities!! Had it not been for the efforts of African Americans, African immigrants would not be able to enjoy the opportunites that the author has.signedAn African immigrant"
4,Excellent Source,"Very helpful explaining Statistical concepts. As a returning grad student, I found my subject text too general and complicated. ""Statistics for Dummies"" was an excellent second source. It is very well-written and easy to understand. I highly recommend this text for students and more importantly, returning students."
3,"its OK, not a good second sourse for a stat class","I was a little disappointed in this book. I usually find the dummies books very helpful in bridging the gap, when I am having trouble understanding a subject. I am currently taking an elementary stat class and bought this to compliment my text. It was not very helpful. Does not explain any of the more complex concepts. This is more for people who want to understand the odds in Vegas."
4,Very Readable,"A interesting, even entertaining, treatment of what could be a dry and/or complex subject.If you have even a passing interest in the subject, this book is well worth your time and money."
2,"""Consumer"" should be in Title","While the book is useful, it should be made clear that this book is aimed at the consumer who has to interpret statistics that he/she reads about. This will be useful for the general public who are baffled by stuff that that is thrown at them, but I was hoping for something to help me get started with my own research problems. Only about 10% of the book does that."
2,Lots of missing information,"I bought this text as a refresher before going back to school and was very disappointed. I had to google more than half of what I was looking for (matched pairs, independent samples) and borrow other people's texts. Do not recommend."
1,Worthless - No Math in this book,This is a book of words and ideas there is no math taught! Worthless if you are studying for a test.
3,A good reference book.,I bought it to review some of the formulae I had forgotten. And it is fairly easy to search it for the topic of interest.
3,Statisics for Dummies,"This was just an ok book. It doesn't cover the basic, basic elements of statistics like variables - what are they and how to differentiate between Nominal, Ordinal and Interval-Ratio variables."
5,Response to Statistics for Dummies,"With more than 55 years since my last math class, even Statistics for Dummies got beyond me. But I will persevere. I'm reading it for myself, so I don't have to pass a class. I find the writing down to earth and sometimes humorous. The first third of the book went well, then I hit a chapter over my head. Perhaps I should skip that and move on and see how it goes. But I do feel that I have more understanding of statistics than before I read the book. I would not hesitate to recommend it."
3,Just ok,"I took a Stats class, and inking I would need this book....it wasn't that helpful, and I think I used it twice."
3,questionable,"Taking masters level statistics. I was suffering in my class and thought this book would help with my studies. It did, but it was not as good as I expected."
3,Not what I expected,Purchased this to help me with Stats but it really didn't help me the way I expected. Too few examples and step by step instructions which led to more frustration trying to complete a course.Not really recommend to a friend.
3,Need examples,The explanations are very easy to read and understand. But I wish they had examples worked out that illustrate how you use the concepts.
2,More of a professional level,Deborah Rumsey has obviously written this book for the professional because there are no examples of any kind to be found in the book. If your looking for a book that shows examples of how to work the formulas for statistics then I highly recommend Shaum's Statistics third edition. Statistics for Dummies is a real disappointment to the dummies series of books.
2,It's just okay,"A reasonable overview of the subject. Go down to your local community college, buy a $15 Texas Instrument ti-30x-II calculator, go on line and pull down a ti-30x-II pdf file for free and REALLY learn what you're looking at. Plus you get college credit for passing. ""Stats for dummies"" reminds me of a MBA in 12 hours course I once took. Oh yeah, you might have to invest some time using excel spreadsheets if the stats course is business related."
2,Not what I wanted...,"I bought this thinking that I would be familiar with statistical principles in experimentation. Given the fact that I was taking an advanced statistics course in the graduate level at that time, and using a more technical book, I thought that this book would provide me a shallower access to the material, a sort of primer. But in some ways it does not. The formulae are there, but somehow, I feel like there are things missing that should be there."
5,Bulova Women's Diamond Accented Watch,"I was very pleased with this purchase. Not only were the savings great but the watch is very attractive and is solidly made. The shipping was speedy and professionally handled. This watch was what my girlfriend wanted and she, being difficult to please, was satisfied. Her only disappointment was that the watch face looked larger in the photo on the web. Other than that minor quibble she was very pleased!"
2,"A good ending, but weird way of getting there","I read it only two days ago and I am forgetting it already.Considering the little girl was the reason for Dot to be in Japan she seemed...pretty under-present, like where was she when the nanny and her father were having all of that hot springs time? I didn't find Calum's confession of love beleivable either, possibly because there was nothing from his point of view and nothing from Dot's to indicate that at all. Never mind how quickly Dot's prim and properness flew out the window. I rather wished that the friend she had been with in the first chapter had made more of an appearance to round her out a bit more, as the supporting characters were dominated by those of his world.I did enjoy the epilogue however, by that time Dot and Calum seemed to have ironed out their relationship to one I would have enjoyed reading more about."
2,Size issues,"I've played tennis all my life, with Adidas shoes, and it's always been size 9 - or 41 1/3. This shoe is a bit long and way too wide at size 9; I exchanged for size 8 1/2 (40 2/3), which was a bit short. Very disappointing, I am still looking for a new shoe."
3,Getting a little more time out of your filter,"I've noticed that if I take a teaspoon of bleach and put it into a full resevior of water after about 3 or 4 weeks into a new filter, that I get almost 2 months out of a filter instead of the usual month. There is a little bleach smell the first day or two but it goes away quickly."
4,Works,I purchased this for my humidifier and it fits. It was well priced as well and I didn't have to go looking for it at the stores.
2,Hate these filters,Have had a few of these now. Company that sells them is great but the filters just don't hold up. They fall apart if you try to clean them. So you just toss them when they go to pot.
3,Cheap filter,First of all I love the machine...BUT the company's have downgraded all filters to junk. Do not want to throw out the machine so after much much looking I found these to be as good as the expensive filters. So I bought several of these filters for the season. They last a couple of weeks and then I throw it away and replace with a new filter
3,HWF65PDQ-U vs. HWF-65 filters,Can someone please tell me what is the difference between the HWF-65 and the HWF65PDQ-U? I have several HWF-65's laying around from my Holmes HM2060W humidifier that recently died and I am trying to find a replacement humidifier that uses the same wick filters. I am seeing a model (HM1865-U) listed on Amazon that says it uses the HWF65PDQ-U replacement filter but no one (not even Holmes) will answer my question of WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO replacement filters?!!?!?!?!? I just need this burning question answered...
1,Not satisified.,"The trouble I have is that it does not absord the water except for the bottom 2 inches, therefore there's not much moisture put in the air."
2,Moldy Moldy Moldy,Yuck. I have bought these in the past and have had no problems. This time they got moldy quickly. Will not buy again.
3,Just like any other filter,"What I didn't like was the shipping wasn't very speedy. Not bad, but if you're used to getting things quickly (as most things come that I order through Amazon whether it comes directly from Amazon or the company) this one doesn't."
3,Great when brand new only...,"This product is great when it is brand new, but after two weeks, it starts to smell because it starts getting moldy. Putting bleach on it makes the whole room smells like bleach. Ick!! Takes two days to get rid of the bleach smell, then have to turn on the air cleaner. What a pain to get a little humidity into the air!! Only purchase if you can keep buying them over and over, again."
1,Which filter is this?,Could someone who bought this please post which filter/humidifier model this is for? I can't believe they don't include the info in the description. Thanks!
3,ok,I like the way the grill cooks but cleaning the thing is a major project and keeps me from grilling more often.
4,Great grill for camping,This is a great grill for camping. It cooks burgers and ribs like a full sized gas grill. It could use a few more BTU's though. Took a long time to bring water to a boil. The other thing to watch for is the quick connect on the back if it is not just right the gas doesn't come out right but all in all I love the compactness of the grill.
3,Get what you pay for,"I just finished assembling my ""Grill 2 Go"". No problem, however, some parts are secured in plastic - DON'T OVER TORQUE. The igniter on one side doesn't work, not sure yet why. May just be too far from the burner surface to arc. There is a chip on the lid under the glaze. Packaging good so must just be QC. Grill material is CHEAP!!! Hope there's an upgrade. Lot's and lot's and lot's of plastic. Not too sure about lonegevity. All that said, the design is great [a wanted a portable I could use day-to-day as well] and I feel I got a lot for under $200. The griddle is neat and offers one a lot of flexibility. Grease tray sticks going in and out. Don't recommend using it while grease is still hot liquid.If I was just starting my search, think I'd spend a few more dollars on something beter."
3,disapointed,"The grill came with a broken part. We could not take the grill with us on the trip that we bought it for b/c the heating unit in the grill that controls the temperature did not work. When we tried to order the peice that was broken it was on back order for a month. We were very disapointed that the item was shipped to us ""new"" and was not useable."
2,disappointed in Charbroil,I am still waiting for Charbroil to honor the warranty on the light bar that arrived broken.
3,Disappointed again...,Bought new in June. Second time we used it the ignition button won't work. Third time we used it the 2 plastic knobs reamed out and now we have to adjust the temp using a pair of pliers. Doubt it will last more than a year so really glad we got a great deal on it but still...Not sure if any others are any better because it seems like everything made today is made cheaply no matter what you pay.
2,Ok. No substitute for a real grill.,"I have had this since July. Assembly was easy enough. Quality is just OK. It has only been used 3 times, but already has chipped porcelin and rust getting started. The plastic parts are rapidly dis-coloring from the sun. (I also bought the cover - so it has probably only seen 15 days of sun since I bought it). My biggest concern is that it doesnt put out enough heat. I am still using the small disposable cylinders of propane, but this really isn't that great a grill. You really cant do anything but grill -no roasts or anything big. I would not purchase again."
1,Major problem,We received 2 grills the orginal one had a huge dent in it so we returned it and asked for a replacement. The second one was even worse and had a cracked hinged shelf. Amazon was great and said they had so many complaints they didn't want to replace it and sent a refund.
2,Not everything you'd hope.,"First and foremost, this grill isn't as portable as the description would lead one to believe. In order to fold it down and use the neat little wheels, one must first remove the unit from the stand (albeit a great workout for your abs), fold up the legs, reinsert the grill unit, do the hokey-pokey, THEN you're ready to go.Secondly, the electronic ignitors worked flawlessly...ONCE. Since then I've had to light the right burner by hand; however, I don't have to worry about all that unsightly arm-hair anymore. Propane works better than a waxjob."
4,Inspect it first!,"The grill I received was mired with pock marks on the lid where the finish popped. It looked like it was shot with a BB machine gun. I didn't return it because I needed to use it and I don't expect to use it very often. I bought it to take to tailgates, car camping, and the beach. The features sold me...nice size for larger groups, paper towel rack...place for a trash bag (albeit grocery size only). The plastic legs aren't really designed for strength so be careful when opening and locking out (lockouts are metal so legs will bend first!). First use was tuna steaks and veggies at the beach. I wasn't sure if it would get hot enough but it charred my veggies and bronzed the tuna nicely. If it can do that, burgers and brats should be a breeze!"
4,Review of Lumiscope 1131,Seems to work easily and well. Took a bit of getting used to doing it correctly but now that we have the hang of it we are pleased to have it. We like the memory function.
5,Awesome Guide Everyone Should Onw,"I bought this book because it was recommended by another site. I did not really know what to expect since I had never heard of root cellaring. This book is a great tool and I could not put it down. I only wish that I had this book at the beginning of summer and not after I finished cleaning out my garden for the winter! I am already starting to redesign my garden for 2013 based on the information contained within this book. I really like how they advise when to PLANT in addition to when to HARVEST! For long term storage, this type of information can make a difference. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in prepping, saving food, time, and money!"
4,More information on the subject than I will ever need...,More information on the subject than I will ever need. Well worth the price if you are interested in this long-established method of keeping food...
4,Why pay so much at the grocers? Learn to store your food.,"I feel this book is extremly helpful if you want to install a root celler.Many how to answers. And in this day with so many moving back to rural area's why wouldnt you want to be less dependent, while providing home grown-healthier food for yourself and those you love?Thank URhonda"
3,Haven't read enough,"I just started this book. So far I like it, but I'm wondering if it will give all the detail I'm hoping for. We'll see."
5,Very Informative,"I found this book to be very informative. We are in the process of planning a root cellar and this tells you everything you need to know on how to do it, how big you need, to what kind of vegetables store the best and when to plant them. I have learned alot!"
5,Everything Old is New Again,This book details many long forgotten skills which may become vital in these uncertain social and economic times. It is listed in my Catholic Rural Solutions Yahoo Group as a must read item.Richard of Danbury
3,Basic and a bit wordy,"I am happy I bought the book, but it is a bit wordy. Good lists, but no good cellers that can be build from the book. Just lots of examples. A good starter to make you think hard if Root Cellering is for you."
3,wordy and redundant,"read thru half the book and yeah I'd like to root cellar but lost interest when all i found was,how much good it would do but not how to do it."
3,Looks great,"Can't seem to get the interest to actually read it. Seems like a good overview, just not a very enticing presentation."
2,The ends of these bend!,"Yeah, these are not exactly top-notch. They work for a few minutes before bending (although, I guess it's good that they bend back, too).I purchased these to pick old paint out of tiny areas not reachable by Xacto blade (yes, I am a home-restoration kook). The curved picks, in particular, are soft and bend easily, even when used gently. The straight narrow sharp tools also bend a bit. The spear-shaped implements--well, I haven't found a use for them yet (the sides aren't sharp and the tip isn't particularly sharp, either). Skip 'em."
5,Beautiful Voice - Great CD,"I've known Wendy for over 20 years after first seeing her singing in NYC's Grand Central Station. She has the most beautiful, most crystal clear pristine voice I've ever heard. I own most of her CDs and this one (""Silky"") is one of my favorites. The track ""Go and Catch a Falling Star"" is especially haunting & beautiful. Every person for whom I've played her music has reacted the same way: ""Wow!!!"""
5,A Roller-coaster Ride of Emotion,"""The Hornet's NestBy Patricia Cornwell9 - 1.5 hour audio cassettesRead by Kate ReadingIn this first title of a new mystery series,Cornwell introduces us to a dynamic trio of crime-solvers in Charlotte.North Carolina:Andy Brazil,an eager young reporter:Judy Hammer,the city's police chief;and Virginia West,Hammer's deputy and a genuine head-turner.They're after a serial killer who pulls male out-of-towners from their rental cars,then mutilates,spray paints and shoots them,in that order.What the trio uncovers jolts them like the sting of the hornet --- Charlotte's symbol.""A ROLLER-COASTER RIDE OF EMOTION.""- Publishers Weekly[from the back cover of case]"
5,Very nice setup,This is a great product and was simple to install. Anyone could do it. Very nice to have the control to air up each bag seperately.
5,One of my favorite albums,"Is this available on CD?I have this album on vinyl, and if you like Motown, the Wonder man, and Syreeta's amazing voice, then you need to own this classic."
4,"Classic, but a little disappointed","This is a classic toy for kids and my two year old son enjoys his daily. My only complaint though, is that the stickers on it started coming off after only a couple of months. Still a good toy, just not as cute now. :-)"
5,"Move over, Fred Flintstone!",My husband ordered this car because our daughter never gets a chance to try it out at playgroup. When she saw it her eyes lit up like Christmas trees & she couldn't wait for us to put it together. It was relatively simple to do & didn't require a lot of tools. She was 12 months when she started playing with it & she's 18 months now & still going strong. It moves nicely on carpet as well as the wood floors. She moves it herself or recruits us or her teenage brother to push her around fast.
5,A classic wonderful toy!,"I wish I had given in and bought this when our first of 3 sons was a toddler - I did for #2, and now it's on son #3. Little Tikes toys are VERY durable; this one is no exception. Kids really get a big charge out of ""their own car"" and it lends itself very well to lots of creative play. It's had LOTS of hard play - e.g. on its back as a rocket ship - and still looks brand new at age 6."
4,Parents can easily push this car,"This car is great and it helps my back when the kids want that extra parent power, I don't have to lean far over (about the same as a stroller) to give them a thrill by pushing them. Mostly they're happy to self-propell."
4,Great Buy!,"I bought this for my daughter who just turned 1 and I must say, the assembly was a bit much! It took myself, my mother AND her mother to get the top onto the car! My daughter wasn't sure of this ""new thing"" in the living room @ first but she's getting used to climbing in and out of it. She can only go backwards right now b/c she hasn't learned how to use her legs to go forwards, that's what I'm used for when she's playing with it! She tends to slip down into the opening where their feet go while I'm ""driving"" her around. Once she gets the hang of driving herself I'm sure she'll have tons of fun!"
5,Cozy Coupe,This was a gift for my nephews second birthday! It is his absolute favorite toy. I will be purchasing another Cozy Coupe for a younger nephew for Christmas this year! I would recommend this product to anyone. Entertainment for your little one for hours! Thank you!
3,A pain to assemble,"The car is great fun and my twenty month old daughter is very excited about it. She calls the little storage bin a ""car seat"" and puts her baby dolls there and is having a great time being ""Mommy"" and driving her babies to see Grampa. As a toy, I give it 5 stars.But, it was a major pain to assemble. The instructions were clear, but many of the holes had extra plastic which had to be scraped out. Some were not drilled out at all. The roof did not go on at all (half the neighborhood tried) and then suddenly went on. It seems fairly sturdy now and we're looking forward to having lots of fun. But, I'm wary of buying more Little Tikes items in the future."
3,Maybe Better for 2+ years,"My son received this toy as a hand-me-down and it's in great shape (hence the 5 stars for durability). The problem is that at 18 months (or younger) my son can't make it move forward with his feet, only backward which is frustrating for him. I have tried to push him around in it but his legs are too long and get all tangled up underneath the car which was frustrating for us both. He's pushed it around from behind but would rather ride in it. He loves it and wants to play with it but I've hidden it in the far reaches of the garage until he's a little older. Perhaps manufacturer's age should be 2 years and up instead of 18 mos."
3,"Good toy, Terrible instructions","The toy once its together is a good toy but good luck with understanding some of the instructions, there is no text, all pictures, and nothing goes together or fits like it should, I had to modify and trim a lot of plastic to make it work."
4,Also disappointed,"Our Cozy Coupe II also has a manufacturing defect. They did not make the hole big enough for the front of the top to fit in place. Right now it is frustrating for our son as the door keeps falling off. Once we can get it fixed properly I know he will enjoy it much more. Otherwise, I think it is a very durable toy that will last our son for many years."
5,Cozy Coupe scores big hit!,"Fourteen month old nephew loved his first new car. Enjoyed driving as well as pushing his 18 month old friend around. Great both inside and out in the yard. Purchased two cars - first required about 20 minutes to assemble, second - learning curve was steep and took about 10 minutes."
5,Little Tikes Cozy Coupe,The cozy coupe is the best product to buy. My children had the most fun with it. It is durable as well. I bought one for a neighbors grand daughter. It is well made. I grade it an A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5,I had one....,"I had one as a child and loved it so I bought one for my son for his first birthday, even though manufacture says for 18 months and over. But I thought it would be fine and it's so far. He can move backswards for now but he does like to crawl in it, besides when summer comes around he will be 18 months and I'm sure he will be able to run in it."
5,Great toy for imagination,"We purchased this toy for our 16 month old grandson. We showed him the box on Xmas day and he was very interested in the car. He and Grandpa put it together the next day with minimal problems. When it was finished he spent a long time getting in and out, steering and making car noises. It is a virtual babysitter for my daughter and keeps him occupied for a long while for a child this age. I think he will grow into it and use it for even more imaginative play. It seems very study and durable."
5,Cool Car,My 2 year old daughter received this as a gift for her birthday. She used to ride in the neighbor's Cozy Coupe every time she would play outside. Now she has her own car. She loves it! She piles her stuff in the back and off she goes.The newer one comes with a key/remote which makes her feel like a grown up. Her keys are just like Mom's (i.e. turns on/off the alarm; opens the door; even starts the ignition). The door is a little bit tough to open/close so she climbs in from the windows.
5,I'm Buying It!,"We went to a friends house and my son fell in love with this car! It was just the right size for him to drive. He loved turning the key in the ignition. He enjoyed putting gas in the car (pretend of course) where the gas tank hole is. Considering my friends little boy put hers through hard play and it still looks new, I think this is a very sturdy and durable toy.If you look for toys that are fun and versatile and easy to use, this is a good toy. If you look for toys that will grow with the child this looks like it'll last a long time for my two year old to grow out of. If you look for toys that do encourage the child to explore his/her world and will do more than just let him/her push a button, this is the toy to get."
4,Worth it after assembly,"Never did I imagined it would take me longer to put this car together than it did anything else we have for our daughter. It took us 4 hours of assembly. The 1st hour was spent clearing the holes to get the bottom assembled, the next 2 1/2 were spent using full body force to try and get the top on. A suggestion from my boss to blow dry the plastic, to make it more plyable, is the only this car now has a top.Now that it is togeter, and my daughter has been playing happily for hours, it is worth it. But a toy that is this popular, and has been around since I was a kid, should not be so hard to assemble."
5,Ranks high with my toddler,"My two year old son fell in love with this car while we were visiting his cousins. Of course, we had to get him one right away. He plays with it every day. He's always been fascinated with our car, from everything to the keys and the trunk. It's great that he can have something like this for his very own. He even likes to watch TV in it and he follows me around the house in his little car. I've bought so many toys for him that he never picked up twice, so I'm thrilled that he loves this so much. He's tough on toys sometimes, but I think this car will carry us through more children, but I'm not sure how he'll feel about another kid taking over his pride and joy!"
3,Grandaughters most loved toy,"My grandaughter wanted a ""go car"", she's 23 months old. Amazon had the best price, and the delivery was great! She loves it, and wants to go outside constantly to ""go car""."
5,Great Toy but NIGHTMARE to put together,"We bought this for our 16 month old daughter because she loved playing with this at her friends house. When my husband went to put this together he found that none of the holes had been ""pre-drilled"" from the factory. He had to cut out the hole for the steering wheel, gas cap, and drill the holes to attatch the roof. It was not easy! I am sure she will love the toy, but her Dad did not love putting it together."
5,Great buy!!!,This toy has to be the best purchase I have made for my child so far. She absolutley loves this car and plays with it constantly. I don't think she played with anything else the first two days she had it! Extremely durable and fairly simple to assemble!
3,hard to put together; door won't stay on,"We bought this for our almost 2 year old. He loves it, which is why I was hoping it would be more durable. My husband had to drill some of the parts to make them fit together and the door will NOT stay on no matter what we do. It's fallen off probably no less than 30 times and he just got it this morning. The workmanship could be better, but other than that, it is a fun toy."
4,Grandkids Love It,I purchased 2 of these for my 2 grandkids and they both really like them. I from my own childrens experience have high expectations of the Little Tikes products and as with this purchase they stand up to what I expect.The only issue is that the kids try to peel off the stickers on the front and that makes me crazy. They should have been painted on or embossed like the Little Tikes emblem. The over all I love the quality and would have given it a 5 but feel there is always room for improvments.
1,This toy is impossible to assemble,"My mother purchased this toy for my son on his second birthday. The pieces did not fit together correctly! We assumed that it was just a manufacturing error, and returned it to the store for a replacement. The replacement did not assemble correctly, either! We had such an awful time trying to put the thing together that we didn't enjoy the birthday party."
2,Disappointed with the product,"We purchased the Cozy Coupe for our daughter for Christmas. We discovered that the moldings and holes didn't align at all. We ended up using a utility knife to cut the holes and make them bigger. It still didn't fit because our daughter still can't close/open the door. We went as far as to call the company and they told us that it is a tight fit and we should try to lube the parts. This will not help since the door doesn't fit and my husband and I have a hard time opening and closing the door. My recommendation would be to find a toy that is comparable and steer clear of the Little Tikes. (We had a similar problem with the Little Tikes Gourmet Kitchen set, also a Christmas gift)"
3,Gas cap woe's,"My son removes gas tank cap and puts items to the inside of the body of this. There is no way other than to drill a large whole into the bottom side to get items out. All the neighbors have the same problem also. If left outside the car fades and collects water in the back open ""trunk"" area. If the water is not emptied before use; my son's backside gets wet. I suggest drilling a small drainage hole in the trunk. My son is of average height for a 3 year old and is just about too tall for this."
4,playtime,"Keeps my girll busy, she loves her lil coupe my neighbor ended up getting her son one also!"
5,Worth the money day after day,Out of all the toys we bought our 3 year old and 2 year old. The Coupe is worth the money. At the moment we own two. Every time i pass a yard sale i always look for another. When friends come over they all want to play with the car. So much in fact that i am looking to get two more to keep everyone happy for the summer. In fact as i write this note they are playing with them right now until it's time to come in.
3,From the Manufacturer,"The classic kid-powered car has a whole new look! Updated styling includes a high seat back and storage in the rear. This version includes lots of special features like a vanity license plate, an ""ignition switch,"" and a key. It also features rugged, durable tires, plus an open-and-close gas cap. It's the Cozy Coupe Car for the next 20 years! Batteries included. Replace with 2 lithium batteries (not included)."
5,"Forget The Kids, I Love This Toy!","Let's face it, the Cozy Coupe has been around for years. I have been playing with these coupes ever since I was a spring chicken. Now that I'm older and have dumplings of my own, I literally fight with my 2 year old to ride inside this thing! Forget sibling rivalry, this coupe is so fun and exciting...I'm the one throwing the temper tantrums over this sporty red car! If you don't already own one for yourself, buy one for your child, and when no ones looking, take this beauty out for a spin!"
5,FREAKIN FANTASTICAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHEN I WAZ LIL A HAD AN AWSOSME COUPLE SOW DURASLE FUN EDU AND SO MUCH MORE.......................BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
3,A good read,It was a fun read I just love his books especially when am not reading them as a literature requirement for school.
2,ok I guess...,"I really didn't enjoy ""The Nose"". It was confusing, and seemed to be moving in a pointless circle."
5,Excellent choral music...,"Purchased this in 2001 during a visit to Salisbury Cathedral. My favorite by far is Richard Shepard's arrangement of ""The old order changeth,"" the famous deathbed speech of Arthur by Tennyson. The entire CD is worth having."
5,This one grows on you! Outstanding effort.,"The Bathers music contains some of the most goregous meoldies you will ever hear. The vocal style takes a while to get used to if Tom Waits isn't in your regular music rotation. I have a few of the Bathers CD, and this is the only one that gets 5 stars. This is the perfect album for that rainy night with that special someone. Soothing and always moving, a must have for any music fan of the soft drum brushes, light guitar washed with piano. It looks like this reissue has a different track numbering than the Marina records pressing, although the tracks look the same. The album art is different as well. The Marina records album art looks much softer and nicer. But the music is what counts here."
4,Secret Treasure,"This was the fifth album from Glasgows secret treasure.Not enough people have heard of this band which is a damn shame because ,trust me,they are superb.I'd recommend this album to anyone, i love it to death,especially classy songs like East Of East Delier,Girl From The Polders and the magnificent title track.For me it evokes the early Van Morrison classic ""Astral Weeks"" or maybe Bowies slower stuff (especially the glorious Lady Grinning Soul).Don't take my word for it,buy this and be swept off your feet!!!!"
3,"Needs a bit more ""oomph""","It isn't bad but neither is it great. It is very easy to prepare - boiling water added, stirred and a 15 minute wait time. Kids will love it.As an adult though....it needs more veggies added (freeze dried bell peppers, dried onions, sun dried tomatoes) and some Italian herbs. And a lot of Parmesan cheese!With a bit of added items it could become a good meal. But as noted, if you like bland with a lot of sauce then this one would work well."
3,Fascinating But Shallow,"This book was rich in details of what life was like in Venice in the 15th Century and I found it to be very insightful in many ways. I also enjoyed the fact that it was multi-layered and moved between numerous plot lines. I was, however, disappointed that it was ultimately too much of a ""bodice ripper"" to keep me reading all the way to the end. I didn't like the characters enough to care how it turned out. I give it three stars for the depth of research that the author obviously employed."
3,15th Century Venice Brought to Life,"It took me quite a while to get into this book but once I did I enjoyed it throughly. This is a book you can become engrossed in, and time passes all too quickly.It takes place in 15th century Venice and this period is obviously very well researched. The plots and counter plots are so numerous that it would be impossible to try to put them down in this short synopsis. There are many emotions and events to think about within the book: Medicine, the effects of plague, prostitution, witchcraft, betrayal, loyalty. Within all this there is the momentous event of the setting up of the first printing press in Venice and the effects this has on the people of Venice.My only criticism of the book and this happens with many books, there are too many characters for the reader to keep an accurate account of and I found myself back tracking frequently."
2,"I Was Looking For 15thC Venice, But Got Lost Along the Way","I had such high hopes for this book. Fantastic settings in Venice, Germany and the Alps. A bit of non-fiction mixed with historical fiction covering the beginnings of moveable printed press. A glimpse at our past. Unfortunately, the book just didn't move along. It didn't seem to have anywhere to go."
4,I really liked this one!,"If you like historical fiction, here is a book to take you to another place and another time...and one that will keep you reading the hours away. The characters are well defined and the plot is woven together in such a nicely intricate way that you'll feel like you're watching a drama unfold. I'd gladly recommend this one!"
2,"Pretentious, but trashy","That about sums it up. Overheaded prose, flimsy characters, sordid situations and a veneer of historical ""class"" characterize this. Beneath its literary pretentions, it's not much more than a particularly lurid Harlequin."
4,A lost gem,"I actually found this in the used bin for $1, and I had read some mixed reviews about it, but it turns out to be pretty great. Not perfect, not the excellent album that was Phillip's first solo cd, but definietly a lovely snapshot of a guy who cannot stop making music, paired up with the likes of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger around the time of the Exile on Mainstreet sessions. Definitely a lost gem. Get it and keep it."
2,Eeeh...not so much,"It is a period piece, made interesting by the famous faces more than the content. Phillips didn't have a lot to offer by this time, and there just isn't much to recommend this, other than pure curiosity."
5,hopefully more to come,what a great suprise at last the album we have been waiting for. now is the time to release the many mamas and papas album. along with a concert dvd. this cd is brill i love zulu warrior
1,Don't waste your money,I at a loss to understand the praise for this release. It should have remained lost...
4,Papa was a rolling stone,"The John Phillips/Keith Richards ""collaboration"" is finally here. I thought it would be more how shall we say skagged out but we're dealing with Papa John here; his songwriting talent, production, singing and playing are all in order. Keith too, and Jagger in the background, and all else who dropped in to play. Kind of a mixed bag; bluesy songs, an MOR song or two, but they're all first rate. Weird to hear Keith solo on songs not in the Stones style. Phillips's vocals sometimes sound like Keith of ""You Got the Silver."" Old-timers like me will probably treasure this CD. Reminiscent of ""Exile"" and ""Sticky Fingers."" I highly recommend this more than a curiosity. 4.5 stars. Thanks, Papa John, and rest in peace."
5,A great wake-up call,"Incredibly relevant at this time. Being from Louisiana, I felt it was important for me to read this. And I recommend this as essential reading for anyone affected by Hurricane Katrina. The chapter specifically about New Orleans was so creepy that I re-read it once I was done. The book is written very matter-of-factly and uses so many agency names and acronyms that it sometimes gets bogged down in itself. But it still reads well, and is so well researched, that this is more than compensation. Would love to read a follow-up."
3,Don't lose the manual,"Once you have this set up, it works pretty well. It's not dead accurate but as always you get what you pat for and it is fairly close.Now setting it up without the manual is damn near impossible. Well, I lost my manual ... after searching the internet I finally found the answer. So for everyone else that lost their manual ... here ya go.To set the time and change from C to F (or vice versa)Press and hold mode until time flashes.max button increases hourmin button increases minuteremote button changes from C to F"
3,Don't lose the manual...,"The thermometer was affordable and displays lots of information. You can also program min and max temps for both indoor and outdoor sensors, and change the temp reading between C and F. However, keep your manual handy...the programming is not intuitive. Setting the clock each time you change the batteries (which is about every 6 months) can be a task without it. Also, if you fumble with the buttons because you do not know how to program the thermometer, you might inadvertently set the min/max alarms, and then you would have a tough time disabling this feature. I have my manual handy, so it's not so bad, but each time I change the batteries, I've got to look at it again--even after having this product for about two years."
2,Not impressed with the Royal WS22,The unit doesn't meet my expectations. The numbers are small and the batteries don't last. There is also a problem with the transmission range it is not as advertised. All in all I would not recommend this item.
4,If you lose the manual,"Some of the features if the WS22 are not intuitive to reset, and you will have to reset everything after changing the batteries in the base station. That's why I always install lithium-ion batteries in both pieces. But even those batteries need changing sometime. I lost my manual years ago, and I've been relying on these reviews to help me reset the station the way I want it. And now, I found a copy of the manual online! It's been scanned in as a PDF and was a bit tricky to get a good print of, but it's here: [...] . Enjoy!"
3,cheepo,"Temperature does not match other thermometers I own, and always shows 1.5 C degrees higher than others.Not possible to set up the gizmo after battery change without the manual - DO NOT LOOSE IT!!!!Frequency used by this is the most popular in the world of wireless home products which means it will interfere with wireless chimes, alarms etc.Short range - does not reach the remote if placed on the other side of the house (approx 12 meters).Humidity level does not show at low temperatures: 4C and below.At temperatures 4C and below weather forcast shows snow only, all thoughout the winter, even if the sky's been sunny for weeks on end."
1,What the....?,"What happened to the dark in the Dark Knight? This figure certainly doesn't seem to uphold the Dark Knight Persona. Mattel has seriously dropped the ball with their new-line of Bat toys. Instead of giving us classic Batman action figures, they've been bombarding us with clowish toys such as these. The color scheme is all wrong and since when does Batman wear all these different outfits. Trust me on this, no kid or adult in their right mind is gonna go for this. It's too laughable. My recommendation would be to get the Batman Zip-line figure...that is if you can get one."
4,Great Addition to Messenger Case,This case adds some extra storage for Wii games when the Messenger Bag runs out of room. It is also great for transporting a selection of games when leaving your system at home. Nice sturdy construction.
3,A little Big,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and they definitely do not run small for the size, actually believe they run a bit larger. My wife is a is a petite size 4, these bibs were unusable and way to large for her. We're guessing they would have been perfect for cold weather activities, just won't be able to find out."
3,Would have loved to understand the sizing,I bought this item for a gift. It would have been nice to have some moreInformation about the sizing on the description. I selected the medium size because anything I have bought her in the past was a medium or large. I figured if these snow pants only came in three sizes that the medium was to cover medium large and their large would cover bigger than that. When I gave the gift they were too small by just enough to make them not practical for their intended use. They are apparently nice otherwise but buyer beware: they are sized like fashion pants.
4,Wrong Color,"I bibs fit great. And they look good too. I haven't worn them outside yet. The picture shows the bibs as gray, the ones that came in the mail were black. I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds, I ordered the medium size and the fit is really comfortable."
4,"Great, inexpensive snow bibs","I purchased these for skiing. The day we went the temperature was around 7 degrees, and closer to 17 below with wind chill. I had REI's Polartec long underwear underneath, a good ski jacket, and (of course) hats/gloves/etc. but I was very comfortable. I used the size chart provided on the product page and was pleased with how well the bibs fit. My only complaint is the placing (or maybe the style) of the plastic clasps that allowed you to adjust the length of the shoulder straps. They were a little bulky and, initially, a bit uncomfortable - but I adjusted quickly and didn't notice them after I got to the mountain. If you are looking to be the most fashionable woman on the slopes, then I would suggest you skip these. But if you want to be comfortable, without spending a ton of money, then these are a great option."
4,Great,Just used these on a weekend ski trip at Camelback and they worked perfectly; they kept me dry and warm. I would have loved if they had side pockets like the one my sis bought but otherwise these do the job. And there is one zip pocket on the right thigh. Overall these were inexpensive and keep you dry and warm.
3,Just ok,"These pants are nicely maid, a bit too wide, but I guess are fine for the slops. I bought it to walk outside with my kids during rainy days, so these pants are definitely waterproof."
4,"Very warm, comfortable","Bought these for my wife so we can go sledding and do more outdoor winter activities.She has been impressed with the quality and the warmth.Her only complaint is fit, she thinks they are a bit tight, and we did go up a size to allow for warm base layers.Still she says that she would recommend these, especially for the price."
5,"Great ""Old School"" Ski Bib","I'm 55 years old, have been skiing for decades, and I prefer ski bibs over ski pants. I have been searching for a good bib, which has been harder and harder to find these days. These bibs are made well, fit perfectly (I wear a size 14 jean and ordered an XL Bib), and look good! Elastic on the sides make it have a ""fitted"" look. Right thigh zipper pocket also has a lift ticket loop inside. Very comfortable ski bib! Very happy with this purchase at a good price!"
4,nice,"Perfect fit and I am very happy with this. Also like the bib feature as it keeps me warmer. Good price, too."
4,Thier Own Special Way,"A good overview of the whole career of this great band, ""From Genesis To Revelation"" all the way to ""Genesis Archive 2"". Although a relatively short book the author provides lots of information on each album and subsequent tour. One of the best aspects of the book are the numerous quotes from most of the band members, as well as some of the band's managers and producers. One of the books few shortcomings is in the coverage of the many solo releases from the band. Solo releases by Anthony Philips, Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford and Peter Gabriel are mentioned and briefly discussed. I would have like to have read more on all of the solo releases. As a big fan of Genesis reading about the creative process behind each album made me run to my CD collection to listen to the wonderful music created by this band. I also learned many things about the band that I was not aware of. I would highly recommend this book to Genesis fans."
5,VERY IMPRESSIVE,For the low $$s spent on this beautifully constructed shelf - I was half expecting something for my shop - however this piece is so beautiful - it is displayed in an area that all can see. Well worth the money. Just wish I would have purchased several more.
5,A walk through Bruder's work,"When I came across this CD, I was quite hesitant about buying it because, I felt more comfortable investing my money on a book rather than unfamiliar CD, not knowing what kind of content it would have. Luckily for me I couldn't find any books about Will Bruder, that I urgently needed. So I decided to try planet architecture. I was quiet impressed with what I found. Besides really valuable information, such as drawings, photos, panoramas, and interviews; the design and layout of the CD is very clear making it very easy to gain valuable knowledge and understanding of Bruder's work. For example, most of the drawings have points of reference that you can click on to view a picture of that exact point. The panorama option works kind of the same, but instead of just getting one view (picture) front a reference point, this feature lets you rotate around the point so you can better appreciate the architecture, like if you were physically in these buildings."
2,Bogus Advertising! Not the complete Mass.,"I do not recommend you purchase this ""album"". Advertised as ""the Mass in G"" and the Haydn Mass, it is only the first selection from each, NOT the entire Mass. I don't believe Amazon gurus understand what it means to advertise a MASS. It should be all or none. I was completely disappointed, not in the performance but in the false advertising."
4,Don't be fooled!,"This is a great recording--it's hard to beat St.Paul's for choral music of this type. But, I was dismayed to find that for $7.99, my MP3 download was only two pieces: the opening movement of each of the two masses."
1,Not worth the time & money,"The book isn't really about life lessons learned in kindergarten...it's more random thoughts that anyone has. Most aren't that ""deep""...just silly random thoughts. If you have a lot of time to waste on reading a book that is full of scatterbrained thoughts about the simple things in life, go ahead an purchase this. Otherwise, get a book that is organized and actually has a point."
3,A good turn on,I agree this is not the greatest collection but it's still 2 disc worth of material that has been remastered fairly well with a deluxe booklet &photos that's very informative.The product is manufactured by Universal/Motown so it does'nt have that el'cheapo look to it. For the price it's offered at it's a steal.
3,I think it's ok...,"This item was ordered as a gift--I had no trouble with the order or shipping whatsoever, however I did not listen to the CD as I shipped it to the recipient right away, so do not have an opinion about the quality of the CD itself."
3,Very repetitive but great concepts for building equity,I enjoyed the book even though it is very repetitive. I agree with the concepts and firmly agree that the outside appearance warrants the time and spending of cash as this gets you the greatest return on your investment. Renters and the Bank make up their mind on a property as soon as they get out of the car. This book will form the basis for future development/investment for me.
4,Tasty,"I am quite fond of these bars. They aren't full of nasty ingredients like most commercial cereal bars. The only downside is that they don't fill me up at all. They are good as a snack, but I can't eat these for breakfast without being hungry soon afterwards."
4,Did the job!,"I bought the book - I passed the exam with flying colors! Need I say more? It covers every aspect of Flash, except the more advanced Actionscript stuff, and gives you a good idea what the exam questions are like. The only problem with the book is that it must have been put together in a hurry, because it's loaded with misprints! (spelling, grammar, and at least one of the answers to the sample questions was wrong.) But all in all, a great book!"
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"I'll make this review short and simple:This guide is way too basic and cursory to justify the $30 retail asking price. If you are serious about passing the certification exam, I suggest that you have given a lot of time towards practicing actual Flash while also investing 4-5 days in your local Borders/Barnes & Noble to outline the Designer test material(available at Macromedia.com) from as many resources that you can get your hands on. I'd also recommend the book's multiple choice testt that are available on Forta.com, as they come straight from the book. I'm sitting for the exam in July and I will let everyone know how I did. This book was a breeze and I'm hoping that the exam will be more difficult."
3,College Reading,I purchased this book for my reading class in college and it came with the answers to the all the exercises in the book so I could check my work or not even worry about having the work completed!
3,Finished!,"All books are wonderful because they give you information you did not have, so I found this book to be full of knowledge."
3,"Okay, but not sticky enough","The product and idea is great, but you have to work on the adhesive portion of the product. My 10 month-old daughter pulls these off way too easily with the double-sided tape that you provide. But, if you use some more robust double-sided tape, you may ruin your furniture."
3,don't stay on well,"I like these, they blend better w/ the furniture than other colors, but they don't stay on very well. My daughter (13 months) is able to rip them right off."
1,"Good cushions, but you better buy separate tape to attach...",It's near impossible to get the backing off the tape. Get your own doublestick tape - like 3M one. Sometimes you could find it local $1 store. The supplied tape will make you to angry birds - simply waste of my time and money. Cushions looks fine and decent quality. I will try cushions and update review - just installed while my baby girl is sleeping.
3,A lot smaller than the picture!,"The cushions that are pictured look to be about 3"" long on each side; roughly the size of your hand. They are 1/3rd that size. They are very small! The quality of them is fine and they will cover the corner of the table, but that's it. They cover the CORNER, exactly. They aren't big and poofy like the picture shows, either. Bottom line: They will protect your baby's eyes and head from going into the corner of the table, and that's what's really important. Just be aware of what you're getting here. As always, if the price seems too low..."
5,works great for me,i read some reviews that said it wont stick..but i didnt have that problem. i just cleaned the corners before i applied the cushions..my son tries to bite it off but still it hasnt come off as of yet and ive had it for months now.
2,Adhesive sucks,"Cushions are fine except I wish they covered further into the table because if you have a table with and edge that's anything but straight (without groves) then these won't stick well. The adhesive is horrible, my complaint is that it took about 3 minutes to peel the double sided tape for one piece and I have nails. There's nothing to help you peel off the other side of the tape once it's on the cushion. There are 3 pieces of tape per cushion."
2,the tape doesn't work,The cushions come with a section of 2 sided tape cut into 1 inch squares. I could not get the backing from both sides without having the tape sticking everywhere but the corner I wished to cusion. I still needed the corner cushions so I sprayed a little adhesive on them. The cushion does a nice job of padding a sharp corner but time will tell if this will work when a 4 year crashes into it on his bike.
2,save your money,"The idea is good, but unless you want to put super glue on your table, these things will not survive a curious child. Save your money, because it wont work."
1,even baby can take the sticky rubber off,"the kushions itself is ok, but the sticky part is too too too weak. my 11 months old son took the rubber off the table right after I put the kushions on the table edge. The product is basically useless if the sticky part doesn't work. I dumped it in my storage room.I just don't understand why people give this product 5 stars....."
1,Better product suggested,"This product is useless. Babies are very curious. My table was safer without her seeing these things on it. Go to Babies R Us and get the Especially for Baby Corner Cushions. They're clear and do not draw her attention. While you're there get the crib rail version of this. If your little one begins to think her rail is a teether, get this. It's safe and bpa free. Both stick very well. Babies R Us used to be an Amazon partner, but since they're not, the link to the products can't be in this review."
2,Needs more tape!,My daughter can easily pull these off the table due to not enough tape being provided. You would think that the tape would be cheap enough to add some extra. Oh and she was doing this at 8 months old... I can't wait until she is stronger... they will all be gone.
3,you get what you pay for,"These corner cushions are cheap, so don't expect much. They'll do the job for now, but I'm sure I'll be replacing them soon enough. The 2 sided tape that comes with is a major PAIN [..]to peel apart, and the foam corner is actually two pieces glued together, with glue smeared all over the inside. Not worth the hassle, I recommend a better product."
1,Poor product,I would not purchase this product. The kushions do not stick on the table. They continue to fall off daily.
3,"Good material, adhesive is garbage.","I purchased these for a 3 platform, 12 corner table in our living room. The table is wood with metal edging so the corners are very sharp and dangerous.. definetly a hazard to my 7 month old baby.The actual foam like protector peices are good, they really cushion the many blows my baby has already taken to the head. Unfortunately, the tape is worthless. They give you hardly any, and it is easily pulled off (or falls off) by little baby fingers. Not one of the 12 on our table has lasted more than a week. We are going to take a trip to the hardware store to see if we can find something a little stronger before our kid bashes his face into the bare corners."
3,Ok-adhesive needs improvement-small,"These cushions are ok. They are a lot smaller than I expected. I had previously bought the Lionheart cushions and they are double the size of the Kidkusion ones. But these were cheaper and now I know why. They do the job and add safety to the room but as most have said, the sticker adhesives are not good. The cushions constantly get knocked off with a touch of them and when he learns, I am sure he will pull them right off. We are going to get some better stickers to secure them."
2,Won't Stick,"I have a toddler and thought these would be a great item to have to keep her from bumping into the corners of stuff. They started to come off the same day we got them. I have even tried hot glue to keep them on with no avail. The only ones that have stayed in place (with the help of hot glue are the ones on our wooden cabinets. Don't waste your money, especial if you are sticking them on a super smooth surface such as corian or glass. If I could I would rate this item 0 stars."
1,"Nice cushions, but the tape supplied is useless","The doublesided tape that comes with these cushions is absolutely useless. It's near impossible to get the backing off the tape. I don't know if it holds the cushions onto the corners or not, because I just threw mine away and bought my own doublestick tape. I think the cushions work fine, but if you're planning on buying these, plan on buying your own doublestick tape. If I hadn't thrown away the package they came in already, I'd be sending these back. It was a waste of my time and money."
2,Toddler table corners,"The corners did not stick well to my table and when they came off it was hard to get the sticky stuff off my table. Within 2 weeks, all 8 were off my table."
1,Worthless on stone table corners,"These Corner Kushins do cushion...when they actually stay on which is near impossible on the stone top on which they were placed. I don't know if they stick better to smoother surfaces. Initially, the adhesive seems adequate but fails shortly thereafter."
1,cheap,Our 13 month old pulled these off the corner of the crib and table within seconds. They became dangerous chew toys in a matter of seconds.
4,Works but the tape is short,"First, the double side tape is not applied on it, and you have to do it yourself.And, there are 8 protectors, and there are only 24 slices of tape in total - please bear in mind that there are 4 contact faces for a pad!So I have to buy extra tapes to have a secure fix."
1,Useless for toddlers,My 18 month old daughter can pull these off with no problem. She has one in her mouth right now. Beware if you are buying these for your toddler.
1,Wooden Rolling Pin!,"This wooden rolling pin does not roll as other rolling pins I am use to. Whenever I use it, it just does not roll and spin. I will not puchase my next rolling pin from Amazon because I might be presented with the same problem which will call for me to pay another shipping and handling fee."
2,the life of the spirit by gordon wakefield,"Not a book for amateurs, but well written, well thought out, although I disagree with some conclusions and arguments. However, delivery was fast, and product was decent. Purchased from Amazon."
1,oops,By changing the cell reference scheme this book requires the reader to completely re-orient in order to understandSome of the principles might be good ideas but it seems as of each one had to be translated into the row-column appraoch to be appreciated
5,Brilliant!,"Excellent book. Refreshing ideas in an easy to follow sequence. Written in a friendly manner. This book doesn't contain wreaths of information about e-learning, but instead focusses on a few key concepts that are illustrated extremely well with practical examples. Definitely not an e-learning Bible, but absolutely vital for anyone who wants a few ideas to kick-start their flailing e-learning courses. Most of the concepts presented are also applicable to regular classroom learning as well."
1,too bad!,"James Fleming seems less like Poirot than Captain Hastings, less like Holmes than Dr Watson. A book in which the moral culprit goes unpunished and most cf the characters live sad, mean lives."
5,beauty & violence,"I found this book to be nothing like i expected, and i thought it was fantastic.For people who didn't like it they must have been thinking it would be different but for me it was great.I havent followed comics or x-men at all really but recently started reading them and books like this let you forget that they are comics and feel like great stories.the setting is nothing like the average marvel comic its a step back to a different life and i believe a great peice of work by people who wanted to try something challenging.if you dont know what i mean the last 50 something pages will clear up any questions about the authors or their intentions with the wolverine origins saga. this is my only problem with this book,it is not a 200 page story, sometimes extras really bug me, and i didn't read more than a few lines of what i consider crap."
3,Not a bad read,"Nice artwork, ok storyline, nothing remarkable.If you're a die hard Wolverine fan you'll want this to complete your collection.Don't expect anthing more than moderately entertaining pulp and you won't be disappointed."
5,Beauty!,"Wolverine has always been my favorite superhero and so this story was anticipated in many ways, and while parts of the actual story could have played out a little differently the entire package is a can't miss. First off Wolverine has always been the quintissential mystery man, and so some people may not want to know his origin in fear that the knowledge will ruin his mystique, after reading this however readers will have even more unanswered questions about the clawed one. The art is groundbreaking with the use of digital painting over Andy Kubert's greatest work. The script by Paul Jenkins is heart wrenching, nobody else in the comic book medium can capture genuine human emotions as well as Jenkins can, nobody. This is a truly classic story, the kind of tale that stays with you. This isn't a superhero story, this is the origin of Logan the man, not Wolverine the super mutant, and it's one of the greatest comics I've ever read."
1,Should have been called the Anti-climax.,"One of the most speculated secrets in Marvel comic's pantheon, the origin of Wolverine, is finally revealed.Was not worth the wait? No. Maybe there was a reason it was a secret, or maybe another author may have done better. The art was ok, but predictable and an ordinary comic style."
5,Excellent!,"This book is SWEET. I read it once, and was so blown away I had to read it again. The plot is solid and does a great job of explaining some things while leaving other things rather ambiguous. The art is excellent- much better than a lot of the art out there right now. EXCELLENT."
2,How can you call this Literature?,"The Wolverine's Origin issues are among the best american superheroes comics I have ""seen"" lately, I wouldn't say ""read"" lately.I would recommend it if there would be a little more depht in the story: the arts are excellent, but sometimes I just feel the words in this comic (as in most american superheroes comics) are senseless, uninspired and very weak.If you are an X-Men diehard fan, don't waste your time and get it as soon as possible; otherwise, don't waste your time reading it. Shop through amazon and get some real books instead. And if you NEED to read comics, look for more mature european comics or japanese manga (you know, those comic books where you can see real people, real problems, and real fun, not mere superzeroes wearing tighs and red visible underwear)...Finally, maybe the fact that Wolverine is not wearing your typical and ridiculous american superhero custome makes this book more readable."
3,What is a paper back?,"I ordered this item because I thought is was a novel, but instead it was a fat comic book I wish they wouldn't have described it as a paper back. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew what it was. I did know someone who wanted it so it was given as a gift. I don't think I will use amazon anymore."
2,"Great art, weak story.","Wow, was I disappointed in the writing on this book. The unique art could not save it for me. After all the hype, I felt a bit cheated by the weak anti-climactic plot. Answered very few questions about the character's history, and only served to generate more."
2,Another Marvel Release with no story just for money,"There is barely a story through out the course of the books. IF I didn't know that Marvel was going to scrap this ""origin"" on a whim at a future date I'd have been happier with it. The artwork is ok and the first book is actually not bad. There isn't enough of a story to support the whole series though."
1,Definitely not worth the wait.,"The appeal of this character was always the Mystery. We didn't know Wolverine's story, and neither did he. For years, Marvel was smart enough to realize this was a big part of the appeal of the character; they also, hopefully, realized that whatever they came up with would fall short of whatever readers imagined. This book is proof of that. His origin has been told, and it is found wanting! I can only pray that Marvel will, in the future, pull a double fakeout and say it was a false memory meant to screw with him. Please!"
2,Not so Good.,"So, there was a grudge and a girl and a murder and a bad childhood (but rich). So what. It took a long time to tell very little and the pretty pictures didn't make the journey much more enjoyable."
4,Finally the origins of Wolverine,You know this book is worth buying just by reading the history of how long it took for Marvel to write the origin of Wolverine.A great buy for fans of Wolverine and the Marvel universe.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"While this book works well as either a paper weight, a sleeping pill, or fly swatter, it doesn't function very well as a story. When this storyline debuted, it was surrounded by a media storm, the excitement was palatable, but I haven't been this disappointed since Godfather III.For all of the fans that have been with Wolverine since the very beginning (like myself) this story doesn't answer many of our questions. It just answers who Logan's parents are and what his real name is, but in a round about way, like the writers were trying to be cool, but not quite getting there. The brightest point in this black hole is the Andy Kubert pencils. For those alone, the books worth thumbing through, but do just that. Go to your local bookstore and look at the artwork, then put the book down and save your money! Spend it on a comic that deserves it! I recommend the Essential Wolverine (volume 1, 2, or 3) or Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, ISBN 087135277X."
2,Disappointing,"If you expected to learn how Wolverine got his admantium skeleton, his true relation to Sabretooth, the peculiarities of his mutated healing powers, his affinity for the Orient, and other pivotal pieces of Wolverine lore, don't look for it in this slow-paced dismal book. Wolvie's just another hero who is - gasp!! - brooding over his daddy's unfortunate demise. Hint to Marvel writers: Freud did write more than one paragraph in his life, maybe you should try doing the same. Equally disappointing was the notion that so healthy and robust an adult started life as a sickly teenager, as if his homestead or uncaring mother were to blame (none of which is made clear by the book). I quit reading X-Men titles around 1985, at number 189 of ""The Uncanny X-Men"" series. Friends tell me that I've missed a lot of revelations in the intervening years and titles. Nevertheless, to call this the definitive origin of Wolverine seems misleading."
3,A fine read but far from awesome,"Overly melodramatic and pushed, industry-wise, through 6 issues without telling much. Even thou the story seemed dragged to me, the ending however felt rushed and leaving the story somewhat incomplete. I don't know if there's continuity to this story (in the Origins titles perhaps?) or if it's a standalone?The art looks like illustrations from a children's story (and why is all the blood gray?) with pale pencils and colored-pencil colors. While i love art done in a painterly fashion like Alex Ross, Ribic, Hampton, McKean and so on (i actually grew up with European comics where this kind of art is normal) this particular work didn't appeal that much to me. Feels rushed, something like a storyboard if compared to the works of above mentioned artists.Kind of a letdown, but worthwhile."
5,A Masterpiece of comic book literature,"Origin blew my mind. I cannot express just how good this book is, but I will try. The art is fantastic, utilizing a sort of ""painted"" style which gives it an effect unique to this book, and it is beautiful. The story as well is simply, forgive the pun, marvelous. Now, I'm not a huge Wolverine fan, so this book didn't hold me captivated over just the fact that the origin of one of the most mysterious characters in comics was being told. This story would have been fabulous even if it were different, new characters not related to Wolverine.To put it simply, if you like Wolverine at all, you need this book."
2,"a BIG ""meh""","I pretty much liked the whole book up until about the last 5 very rushed pages. Spoilers: I assume Logan is really victor creed...but doesnt explain how he gets the name, nor does it explain how his scar across his face heals, nor does it explain why he's even angrey. Because James killed the father he hated? or because James ratted him out? OK...whatever...that is certainly not enough to justify the raging war these two carry on for a lifetime. The book really doesnt reveal anything and it kinda gives lame reasons for why certain things are the way they are. I'm gonna have to pretend I didnt read it."
2,Disappointing...,"The coolest part of the entire book is the back cover art, which raises some interesting questions, and does, in fact, shed light on Wolverine's Origins. The rest of the book...the story, the characters...I was not impressed, and choose to disregard its existance in the legend of Wolverine. Bottom line, I regret spending full price for it."
3,Nice read.,"This was my first book by Allison Lane and I found it very enjoyable. Although it is the second instalment in a trilogy, I feel it can be read as a stand-alone story.The main characters Gray and Mary are very likeable, though a little different to the usual leads found in Regency stories, which made a nice change. The author has also included a lot of period detail.Overall, a nice read."
2,Reads like a 5th grader wrote it.,"This book is full of typos and grammatical errors. Parts of the book are just plain missing. There are only 8 of the 10 sales commandments. One of the scripts it advertises is not there. Sentences just stop. On the plus side it does have some useful information, but there are better books out there."
4,Community Organizing and Social Activism Essentials,"This book is particularly good for understanding the relationships between the organizer/facilitator and the grass roots community activists, for understanding what can be done during down times when social movements are least active, and for understanding the role of education in the transformation of society."
2,One Tough Read,"This book was required for one of my master's level courses. In theory, the book was a great idea and the authors had some good points. The downside is that it was merely a transcription of a conversation, not the garden variety book that I had expected. It was hard to read and keep up with, as my interest was waned when they only talked about writing a book in the first chapter. It would have been a much better reference book had there been more organization."
5,Solid Theory Combined With Practical Application,"This book is essential reading for anyone needing to implement and manage corporate strategy in a rapidly changing economy. The authors provide a well-informed and interesting perspective on how to navigate government relations while maintaining a competitive advantage. This is an important contribution to current management theory that provides ample food for thought, as well as solid recommendations for practical application. Interesting, focused, well written and useful!"
2,Not the Susan Sloan I Love,"Having read all of Susan Sloan's previous novels, I was looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. The book is depressing and the main character unbelievable. With the author's previous novels, I couldn't hardly wait till the next chapter. This book is boring. I found myself skimming over pages just to get through it. If you've never read Susan Sloan, skip this one and read one of her others."
3,Behind Closed Doors,"This book meanders - from an abusive husband, wife and children, into the dark world of drugs, prison, and was quite unbelievable that a woman would be stupid enough to stay with that sort of abusive man!! And, keep having children until she had five. This is the same author as ""Guilt by Association"", which is very clever, and I've read several times. She didn't even report the abuse to anyone, so didn't quite have a leg to stand on when it came time for her murder trial. I felt very little sympathy for this woman, and was greatly disappointed in all the drug details, as well as her use of that objectionable F word a few times."
3,"OK BOOK, NOTHING SPECTACULAR","I felt like this book started off pretty good, but then after several years of abuse and just continuing to have baby after baby I started to get a little bored and just wanted to finish the book."
3,Don't bother,"I am a big fan of Susan Sloan - I have read all her other novels and passed them on to all my friends. This book is a huge disappointment. Abused women is not a new topic and this is even medicore in that arena. There is very little suspense and the characters are not well developed. The main character's life as a mother with five children is totally unbelievable. They leave home and she doesn't attempt to locate them! If you haven't read her other books - run, don't walk to nearest bookstore or library to get them. Don't bother with this one."
1,Oh please,"First of all, the teacher's relationship with the kid was completely overblown and unrealistic. Second, her reaction to the kid's stress was overblown and unrealistic. She's supposed to be some authority on emotional abuse of children, but Brian's parents problems weren't emotional abuse, they were family problems (okay, illegal, expensive and dangerous family problems, but the kid wasn't in on all that, he just knew dad wasn't coming home on time and mom and dad were fighting a lot.) There were interesting elements in the plot, but they just didn't logically intersect in the ways Kane tried to make them do. This if my first Kane, I doubt there'll be another."
2,"Same Old Story Line, One of Kane's Worse","Julia Talbot is a child psycholoist and second grade teacher who is very attuned to her students. She senses something is bothering her favorite student and friend, Brian Stratford. His father is mayor of the town and is running for the State Senate. The Stratfords are millionaires and exude a great deal of power. Julia and Brian's uncle, Connor, meet and sparks fly. There is political intrigue, family problems, but nothing even remotely dealing with child abuse which this book's back page leads you to believe. Same old stuff. I've read all of Andrea Kane's books and especially loved her historicals. This is not one of her best."
4,Just skip the epilogue,"This is the story of a child who perceives the problem of his parents an that keep him down, is a different kind of story because of course that could be real, but in the other hand, as it says in the book ""Marriage is not an eternal romance in a path full of roses."" Anyone who is married knows that this is true, the problem is that when your children just see the problems, is when they have serious problems.In the other hand, who wasn't in love with his/her teacher in second grade?The book will keep you reading and it won't be out of the story at any time. but don't read the epilogue, don't worth it."
1,If you want romance don't pick this one!,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this book! I absolutely LOVE Kane's work but I found nothing of merit here. The characters were shallow, the plot contrived and other than an extreme case of lust there was NOTHING to draw the couple together. Once they fell into bed together their story was over. Not only that but the storyline didn't really have anything to do with them at all. Does writing contemporaries mean no romance or tenderness or does it just mean falling into bed at the most convenient opportunity? PLEASE Andrea go back to writing historicals!"
2,It was okay but ...,"... several unnecessary errors caught my attention. Two-week-old babies can't smile, even at special uncles. Seven-year-old boys aren't old enough to play in Little League, and are not coordinated enough to throw curve balls well enough to win game after game. And any seven-year-old who had gone through what Brian did would be a basket case, totally unable to turn on a dime and be his old self within minutes of being reunited with his parents. Then there was the sentence, ""Conner frankly admitted how much he'd agonized during the hours she'd remained unconscious and his INEXPLICABLE relief when she opened her eyes."" (Capitalization mine.) What's inexplicable about that? Where was the editor while this wrong word got by?And yes, the epilogue was dopey."
4,If you follow the directions it works,"I was nervous about buying this automatic litter box because of of all the negative reviews. Mine works wonderfully. My only problem was that it would run continuously until I reduced the amount of litter and used the good clumping litter. You have to read the directions! And then its great, and my cats love watching it run. Now I have two."
1,"LitterMaid Self-Cleaning Automatic Litter Box, Sage and Cream","Unless your an idiot & like wasting your money & the frustration of their so called tech support which advises you to get out tools & then they tell you how to dissemble this or that part to try & fix what is broke right out of the box, avoid at all cost,,,oh yea, did i mention what an extremely poor job it does?"
1,Worst Product EVER Made,"I have one cat and she nothing out of the ordinary. After using a regular litter box for about 2 years, I thought that I would try the self-cleaning one. Big Mistake! First of all, the batteries wont stay in the holder. Then the machine is super loud. It scrapes through one time then circles back and does it again. It woke me up everytime it went off. The litter pours everywhere and after about one week of use, the rake ran out of power and slowed down to the point where it wasnt picking anything up. I was soo excited about this product and when I showed my friend it, she said ""I give you one week, thats how long we lasted"". Boy how she was right! I ended up throwing the whole machine away and going back to my old way of doing things. Definitly not worth your money and I wish that I didnt waste mine!"
1,Broke within two weeks.,This thing constantly got stuck where intervention was need to 'unstuck' it from the cat mess. That kinda defeats the purpose of 'automatic'. One day it got stuck while I was a work. The poor thing was grinding for who knows how many hours. Stripped the gears and it was the moved to the trash.
2,Litter Maid made poorly,"I had this and had 1 cat to start with and she used it fine and we adopted a kitten to be part of our family and she used it as well. But the containers never fit properly and it would overflow on to the floor as a result or it would get jammed. The first weeks we had it, it was wonderful and I did do the non stick spray and it didn't help much with the sticking. The thing jammed and made a horrid squeal. Also we had a power outage and when the power came back on it blew the litter maid so it is now in the garbage...I am glad it was this instead of the computer to be honest."
2,read if more than 1 cat,"I had one kitty and she did pretty good-she is a fairly neat cat. I needed to empty about once a week-don't let the receptacle get too full because if you do and try to get it out...you will be slinging poo all over. So everything is going fine until Frank joined the family. Frank was a beautiful Siamese baby who showed up at my office. Sweet and with a hernia. Frank has single handidly broken two boxes and I swear I had to empty almost everyday. I think he loved the thing so much he went all the time. I also bought one for my brother. Patch was able to break his first one overnight. The second one broke in a week. My brother would like to offer Patch as a test cat to litter-maid. I have never seen anything like it. So, I think it depends on the unit you get and the cat you have. I have gone back to the original litter in a plain box. Good Luck."
5,LitterMaid LM700 Self Cleaning Automatic Litter Box,Prior to purchasing this litter box have been using an earlier Model for many years with great success. Since my cat population has increased to three decided another was needed. All three cats adapted to the new box well and it is much easier to clean than having to clean the old type box which was used along with my 1st LitterMaid as new cats arrived!! Also less litter is tracked out onto the floor.
4,Happy with auto litter box,This litter box has proven very handy. On the whole it works fine.There are two small issues I have. It occasionally gets obstructed slightly and cycles back and forth repeatedly till the problem is cleared. An auto cutoff after a few repeated sweeps in a short time would be nice.The other is that litter drops through to accumulate under the bin. This is pretty gradual though and no worse than having the cat kicking litter out of a regular cat box.Having the box cleaned regularly so the cat is comfortable without our having to remember to do the cleaning frequently is very nice.
2,What a waste...,"I got this as a wedding present (to each their own). I thought that it would be the greatest thing on the face of the planet - no more scooping litter, and and no more mess. Considering at the time of my wedding, my precious little kitten topped 20 lbs, he produced more waste than many dogs. The rake on this got jammed CONSTANTLY. it normally happen about 2 or 3 in the morning, right after he used it. When it didn't get jammed, it flung, uh, crap, across my laundry room. I kept it for about 8 months, realised that I handled the litter less with a box of sifting litter box liners (about $[...] US) and kept the box area cleaner."
1,Terrible!,"It broke after two weeks! It never even worked that well to begin with, it would try to scoop but would always get stuck halfway. We used the proper litter and even tried a few different brands, but nothing would help. One day, it just stopped altogether... A total waste of money!"
1,Waste of time and Money!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"I bought this product because I knew several people who really liked it..... but the second time it was used, by my older cat, the machine broke. It has these very cheap plastic guides, and both of them snapped off this morning (I just put it together last night), and now I am returning it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,LitterMaid,"The automatic litter box is a waste of money. I bought one and within a couple of months turned it off entirely and used it like a normal litterbox. The main drawbacks are that the combs rake the tray and catch the fecal matter, but this in turn tends to stick to the combs, often rendering them useless for further raking until cleaned by hand. Then, if you do not catch this immediately, the box jams. Aside from these mechanical difficulties, emptying and cleaning the tray (even when wrapped with a plastic liner) is also a messy process.In the end, it is simply easier, faster, and cheaper to do it the old fashioned way."
5,Awesome,There is a newer model and it is bigger for two cats. I will never have to scoop anything again. =)
4,My cats love it...I'm getting used to it.,"Basically, the LitterMaid litterbox is an improvement over the non-motorized kind.Some of the clumps tend to stick to the teeth of the litter rake, though. Those, you have to remove with the little brush that is included with the unit.Don't overfill! It will not automatically shut off, if there is too much litter in the box. This saves money on buying litter. I made the mistake of buying the privacy tent. The litterbox is almost impossible to get out of that thing, (I have a bad back)and with two cats, I need to change the receptacle, and clean the rake off frequently. Consequently, my cats have no litterbox privacy, but they have acquired a new ""playhouse""!;) :)Seller shipped this super-fast, in wonderful condition!"
1,THUMBS DOWN,"I thought the Littermaid was a good idea, but in the last 3 months --- my 2 cats have used it only 3 or 4 times. I put it next to my ""regular"" litter box (as the instructions suggested,) but no cigar. Ultimately, I was afraid to remove the old box for fear the cats wold poop on the floor, and pee in the corner.On paper, the Littermaid sounds terrific. I bought it because my sister-in-law said it was the greatest. Later, I asked my sister-in-law if her 2 cats used it, and she said ONLY ONE did. (Wish I'd asked before.) So, for me, I wish I had my money back."
3,"Such a Hassle, But *Occasionally* a Gem","We have two Litter Maids, a mega and a standard. The standard size almost never jams; I think the design is slightly better (it's deeper than the mega, although it's less wide and shorter). The mega is a pain in my neck. It jams almost every day; sometimes twice a day. And deep-cleaning it is a two-to-three hour chore. However, on those special occassions the box works without jamming, it's a much better alternative than the old-fashioned way."
1,A waste of money if ever there was one!,"I have one cat and I have wasted my money on stupid things in my life e.g. drugs, women, wine, etc. But this has to be the biggest waste of money I ever wasted. From the start there was trouble, it didn't clean properly, and then I had to clean this machine and let me tell you that was no fun. Then it worked for about two weeks. I was happy. My cat was happy. Then it stopped working. I guess the motor broke or something, who knows. I just threw it out after about a month of hassle. I mean, if you want to be involved with your cat's feces then this is the box for you as you will always be checking to see if the thing is working or not. Do yourself a favor, waste your money elsewhere."
3,Hint,"Instead of buying the expensive plastic trash containers, put in a grocery bag. It will save you money and time."
1,"Poorly made, broken after only 2 weeks","For the first week, I loved it. Then the rake assembly began to have multiple problems. It has spontaneously fallen off at least 4 times. Now, no matter how perfect the litter is, it can't seem to rake the box at all, even after one use. I have 4 cats using it, so that may have contributed to it's problems. However, I cannot recommend this item at all. I feel like I completely wasted my money on it."
3,Tips for operation!,"In response to an earlier posting, yes, this box leaves a lot of mess behind and around the box. My little plastic waste boxes fill up within a few days, and now I need more! I've only had it for a couple of weeks now. I have; however, found a great alternative ""mix"" for the litter problem. Most people have a hard time finding a good litter that is inexpensive. If you're worried about cost and keeping chemicals and dust LOW, pick up some cedar litter (fine -not chips) or wheat litter, and a fine but inexpensive clumping litter and mix them together to create a special mix. I even use crystals occasionally- eventhough it says not to- I've never had a problem doing so. This mix goes a LONG way and it is SAFE for your cats! The rake will stick less too with the wheat or cedar and help keep the odor down."
5,No more odor and less mess to clean up!!,"My cat,Annie and I thank you LitterMaid! We've had our LitterMaid almost a year. I spend a lot less time cleaning up and the odor is gone! With the carpeted walk-up pad, there is less litter on the floor. I vacuum the pad and floor once or twice a week. I wish the containers were more stable. One of your viewers put mailing tape around the edges of the container and sprayed it with oil so the litter is easily removed so she can reuse the container. I'm going to try that."
1,So NOT worth it.,This is the worst product I have EVER used! DO NOT buy this litter box!! You might as well just pick up the [waste] by yourself b/c it just ends up getting caught in the rake of the box. You're better off spending that $100 on a pair of shoes or something more useful!!
4,Works ok,"I have this and the semi-automatic one. I already reviewed that one as a piece of junk. This one works fairly well. I have three cats and we have to clean both litter boxes probably 2 - 3 times a week. This can jam if you get too much litter in the pan and I've noticed the older it gets, the more temperamental it is about jamming up. I've had this box a year or so and even keeping the sensors and tracks clean, it does jam up once in awhile. Over all though, it's a lot better than having to clean the boxes out everyday, which my prissy cats would require. When it dies on me, I'll consider getting another one."
4,The bigger the better,I bought the single cat litter mate and my cat had issues with the size. So now I have the larger version. I also used some cat litters that were not very good. Even though it is recommended do not use the arm and hammer. I found that Tidy Cat clumps better. I wish the space between the rake's teeth were a little closer. Other than that I have enjoyed it. Reuse the containers if possible. If it's not then it will cost you. My cat goes through about 3 a week.
1,WARNING: My cat was trapped,Warning-the Littermaid can be dangerous. Our cat became trapped behind the raking device. The device did not stop moving back into place and it trapped her between the device and the back wall. It did not move off of her and we could not get it to release. Please be sure to check your motion sensors and stop bar so that this does not happen to you also. I would definetely not recommend using it with kittens as it could crush them. We later tried stopping the rake with our fist and that could not even stop it. Please be careful!
2,"When it works, it's great! When it doesn't, well.......","As long as you don't mind spending [price] to replace the unit every 6 months or so, the Littermaid self-cleaning litter box is wonderful. I have 5 indoor cats. For about 6 months the product is a God-send. Especially if you use the premium scoopable litter. Nice smell and clumps in a way that the box ""likes"". The obvious down-side is that LitterMaid hasn't quite figured out how to create a product that works well for any length of time. Some day, somebody will invent a similar product that really works. Don't ever try to deal with LitterMaid's customer service."
3,Good product for cat lovers,This product provides a very convenient way to perform one of the less enjoyable tasks while being a pet owner. We've used this product for many years and each one has lasted about 3-4 years.
1,defective unit,"I ordered this product and when I received it, it was defective. The rake would not stop. I sent it back and received another one. It did the exact same thing. I have since returned this unit to Littermaid. I am waiting on a replacement unit. Obviously there is a problem with this particular lot of boxes. I hope the next one will work."
3,MESSY,Maybe it is just my messy little kitty but there sure is alot of extra litter that falls between the kitty tent and the litter box. It is mostly under the ramp. I do love the fact that I haven't scooped litter in a long time!Sometimes the rake really struggles if your kitty likes to pee on the side of the box instead of right in the middle of the box like we would like. The clumping litter then clumps to the side of the box. I was using Fresh Step but now using Scoop Away. Scoop Away seems a littler better.I would buy this product again if I couldn't find a litter box that was less prone to messiness and the price was right.
4,good but not the best.,"I have being using it last 7 months. it's working good. Saves lots of timesit stops the smell a lot. Only think is it is making a lot of noise when it works, it sometimes scary in the middle of the night. So you should find a place that is not close to your bed room."
2,"Pretty good for 14 months, then died","Like many, I was excited when I first bought this machine 14 months ago. Being a dog guy with a cat wife, I was glad to not have to scoop the poop everyday. I give this machine credit that it did do a pretty good job for quite awhile. Granted you will have stuff stick to the rack often, especially if your cat goes in the same place. If the thing stops working, customer service will have you press the relay buttons which normally help.However after 14 months, resetting the buttons didn't help and now it seems dead. Littermaid offered a discount which with shipping came out to how much I spent in the first place. So for me it's not worth the money to possibly have to replace it at another 14 months, just outside the warranty period. But that's the risk of electronics I guess."
1,Not Worth Buying,I was so excited to get this litter box for my 2 cats. I thought this would make my life much easier but boy was I wrong! The tines on the rake would not always pick up all of the waste and alot of the waste would get stuck to the tines. I tried putting PAM nonstick spray in the bottom of the box and on the tines without any luck. Many times the box would continually run because of some of the waste that was left on the tines. The cats also had litter all over the place. After giving this a try for 3 weeks I cleaned it up and put it in the attic. I am much happier using a regular litter box.
1,Disappointing for something close to $100,"This product always got stuck and made this loud mechanical noise of moving back and forth while trying to get unstuck. Sand litter ended up overpilling the sides and being much more difficult to clean. Futhermore, the rakes and poop bin would be dirty with feces and smell horrible. This is one expensive, high-tech piece of junk. My one cat and me are doing much better with a Vanness litter box, disposable plastic liner, and dirt cheap clay litter. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Do it yourself,"To be honest I could live without this machine. It is very loud, and annoying. The poo gets stuck in it all the time. I end up having to clean up the poo that got stuck or was missed. It is also too small. My cat can barely get her tail in there! Also it is expensive. Who would pay over $100 for a kitty,lets say... toilet unless you have nothing better to spend your money on. I got this for free from a friend who said her cat did not like it. I thought- how bad could it be?well actually REALLY bad. And the odor- it still stinks."
4,Worth the investment,"I bought a littermaid when it first came on the market and I have found it to be very helpful. I have two cats and it seems that the minute I clean the litter box, they jump right back in and mess it up again. It drove me crazy! Most of the problems that I see others having can easily be eliminated by putting the recommended amount of litter in the box. After two years, the motor gave out on my unit and I am going to purchase another unit. It is very easy to clean and I think it is worth the investment."
1,cheap - constantly breaking - waste of money,"I am on my 3rd box in just about 4 years... they are constantly breaking! My boyfriend, an engineer has repaired two of them, but they just aren't very well built. When we called Littermaid to complain and to buy replacement parts, the parts were practically more expensive with shipping than buying a new one!Don't waste your money."
1,THIS ITEM SUCKS!,"RAKE INTERFERES W/FRONT OF UNIT, RAKE ASSEMBLY FELL OFF OF GUIDES,IMPOSSIBLE TO RE ALIGN,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT."
2,"littermaid,still leaves mess","I have used my littermaid cat box for a year now and am very disappointed in it. It is nice to have the cats go in a clean litter box, but what about all the litter that gets all over the place outside the box. And what about when the poopy gets stuck to the rakes? And what about how hard it is to fine the supreme litter that doesn't make the rake stick...I am now serching online for something better. I really don't like the mess it leaves behind. If anyone has any help for me, I'd sure welcome it.thank you!"
1,Not for me.,"I have a friend who has a Littermaid, and has had no problems with it, but mine broke within a couple days. However, I did buy mine used from a yard sale, so that could be part of it. It worked fine at first. One of my cats likes to use the litter box right on the edge of the box, and the Littermaid doesn't clean that area very well. My other cat digs A LOT in the litterbox. Whenever he went, he would pile up all the litter in one big pile. I think that's what killed the motor. He also was used to more litter than what you're required to use for the Littermaid. He likes to dig deep. I have a CatGenie now, and I absolutely LOVE it. I know it's much more expensive than the Littermaid, but it's worth it for me. At least consider the CatGenie before buying a Littermaid."
3,Time Saver,"This is the second one of these type of litter boxes I have bought. I purchase the first one when they first came out, and it did not last long. My sister had a similar experience, and said the new ones are much better. I like it for the convenience, but it the receptacles are costly."
5,Do you have one for dogs too,I just wanted to know if you have one of these for dogs too.I know many elderly people who sometimes can't take their doggies for a walk and this would be such a helpful item for them.
5,A 3 Littermaid Family,"I love the littermaid. We have a multiple cat household. It is the only way to go. I empty the containers twice a week into plastic grocery bags and put paper towel in the bottom of the Storage container. I change the storage containers once a month. My cats love the littermaids. I have used them since 1998. They have improved so much. I use Scoopable Clumping Type Litter. I have just replaced one of my original littermaids with this littermaid I purchased from Amazon. It was 9 years old. The house does not smell like a cat litter box, there is not litter all over the floor by the litterbox, and best of all I don't have to SCOOP!!!!!"
2,For a one cat household,"This thing was terrible. I spent more time cleaning this box and it's parts than I ever did scooping before. 1.) 10 minutes is not enough for waste to harden, so instead it sticks to the rake. 2) The rake doesn't reach the bottom of the pan, which means you have a thick bottom layer of cat urine that must be scraped off the bottom. 3) While out of town the rake got stuck in the up mode with the motor running, which scared my cats and did not allow them entry into the box. Needless to say, they found other places to use the bathroom throughout my house. I returned the box and went back to my personal favorite ""Omega Paws Self Cleaning BOx"" No motors, no worries if you have to be away for a day or two and you don't have your hands constantly in the box trying to clean it."
2,Scared my cat!,"The noise scared my cat so much that she started to go outside of the litterbox. I tried buying the tent to give her some privacy and make her more comfortable with the idea, but that didn't work. I went back to scooping with a regular covered litter pan. Not worth the price, especially considering I had to clean up messes outside the box (kitty went back to consistently going in box after switching back, so it was definitely related to this product). I sold this product to a friend whose kitty is fine with it. Works well as long as your cat is comfortable with this product."
1,Save your money,Poor build quality and design. Sensors and track get dirty and the rake runs back and forth repeatedly freaking the cats out. Used it for several weeks and abandoned it in favor of the trusted plastic scooper.
1,Don't buy this......,"I have had these in the past and have had good luck with them. Now they are obviously made cheaper and don't work from the start. I have tried everything to get statisfaction from the company but I can't give them enough numbers off the #%** thing. Everytime I call the person I get wants another set of numbers. They are hard to read and located everywhere. I bought a large, deluxe model and a small one. They have never worked."
1,bad sensors,I bought my unit in November 2008. Now January 2010 and the sensors are not working. Littermaid will do NOTHING because unit is out of warranty. Out of warranty by a couple of months. Give me a break. I paid around $100 for the unit and now it is no better than a regular cat box. DO NOT BUY THIS BOX!
2,disappointed in the newer model,"I bought my first littermaid about 6 years ago, the cheapest I could find actually. It worked wonderful. I just adopted another little kitty and since the old littermaid was looking a little worse for wear decided to buy a newer better one. It would not stop raking, I tried everything I could think of and had to turn it off finally. Called Amazon and they sent me out a replacement. Same thing, empty and inch by inch to the do not fill past this line it would not stop running. I plugged in my 6 year old cheap skanky looking one and it worked perfectly, empty or with litter in it, it stopped after the first run through as it is suppose to. And your right.. Don't call the 800 number on the box. Talk about a useless number. Needless to say I am sending back both maids and useing the cheaper one. I guess bigger and better are not always Better!"
1,Multiple Defective units,"These litter boxers work for a couple weeks, and then stop. Very frustrating!!! I will not buy from manufacturer again!!!"
2,Meh,"Good concept, poor execution. The basic idea behind this product is fine, but it would work a lot better coupled with stronger parts, and a quieter motor. Our box kept scooping if the cats kicked the litter up too high near the motor end, and tended to scare my boy cat. The receptacles weren't much easier to change than scooping the box would have been. After cleaning up after a cat who was too afraid of this box to use it, it's going to a friend with a fearless kitten who wants to try it."
2,Quite helpful at first...,"At first the litter box was quite helpful, you know, it cleaned it all up rather efficiently (We liked it despite the loud noise it made...) Later on we noticed it was not working quite as well, even the minor clumps of litter were not getting moved. About a year after buying it, the darn thing kept going up and down, up and down all night long, the loud noise would always keep us awake, etc. etc. etc. yet with all that, it missed everything, the box looked like it hadnt been cleaned in weeks. (Because it hadnt!) Any way, my suggestion to you, do not get it. You are better off with a normal plastic box and a pooper-scooper. BELIEVE ME!"
1,Use Caution,"We've had two of these, in two different sizes. They worked wonderfully for a while. But the smaller one, after a couple months of use, started throwing ""the stuff"" a couple of feet across the floor when activated. The larger just stopped working altogether. Both were cleaned about twice a week."
1,This machine deserves ZERO stars,"If you haven't bought one, DON'T! As other reviewers have said, the box is messy, the rake is constantly clogging up and in the hot humid weather of the summer, the litter regularly sticks to the bottom of the box. Not to mention that I have had a recurring problem with the plastic band that controls the rake. It becomes wrapped around the rake and then snaps. When I contacted Litter Maid about the problem, the completely ignored me.I need automated boxes as I run a TNR/placement program for abandonned cats. LitterMaid isn't the answer. Poorly designed, high maintenance and not able to handle the work required in a multi cat household. I have moved on to a different brand."
4,LitterMaid Automatic Self_Cleaning Litter Box,"I really enjoy being able to travel 2-3 days and not worry about someone coming by to scoop the boxes so the cats behave. I liked my first one so well, I purchased a second one two weeks later.I did have a problem the first day I set it up. It came off track and was difficult to fix. After I figured out to keep the litter ONLY at the minimum line, it hasn't been a problem since. The other negative would be the expensive replacement pans and carbon filters. I reuse my pans several times before trashing them. I also use litter deodorizer on the bottom of my disposeable pan or a little litter there to prevent the sticking.All in all, I would give it a 4-star. I don't miss all the daily scoopings!"
1,Maybe for kittens...,"My husband and I bought our cat this contraption for Christmas. Let's just say, it was set up on the 25th and broken on the 26th. The automated rake would stop halfway or move all the litter to the end of the box so that when it would try to move the waste into the receptacle, it would jam. The wheel on one side of the rake broke after it tried to do a once over.Also, the automated rake couldn't pick up the urine clumps. Who knows, it may have been my cat, but I thought it was meant for cats of all shapes and sizes. As for the length and width of the litter available, it seemed much too small for our 14 lb. cat and he looked cramped while doing his business."
1,Beware!,"I bought one of these cat boxes about 5 years ago and loved it. So when that one wore out, I bought a fancier self-cleaning cat box - it didn't work, and I returned it. So I bought the original self-clening cat box thinking it would work just fine - well it did for about a week, and then just stopped working. So now I'm scooping a $70.00 cat box each day....Not a good thing.:-("
2,NIce idea but..........,"I own a lm700 and here are my thoughts.The motor that rakes the litter seems to be weak and 20% of the time I have to use a scooper to remove large clumps. Many times damp clumps stick in the rake and have to be removed manually. Although the cats use it I do notice there is less waste in it compared to the conventional litter box. I don't imagine this is a good thing if they are holding in their waste because they are not comfortable using it.In conclusion, the time and effort needed to tend to the cleaning process and replentishing of the litter every few day on the LM700 is more work than simply scooping the conventional box once a day. Couple that with the potential health problems which might be encountered I discontinued the use of the LM700 after 2 months."
1,Worst piece of junk I've purchased in a long time,"I still can't believe that I wasted so much money on this piece of junk. The first one I had received wouldn't ever shut off. Once it was replaced with a new one, the cat poop and litter kept getting stuck in the rake, litter would be everywhere but in the receptacle and I was cleaning up an even bigger mess then the original $10 litter box. Stupid me also bought the privacy tent that was cumbersome and got stained way too easily and extra receptacles which I'm probably going to end up throwing away. What a huge disappointment this whole experience has been for me and my family."
2,If you just have to try this...,"Please read all the negative ratings about this product because they are all true. Weak motor, expensive trays, cheap construction, etc. And the batteries last only two weeks at best, which is expensive if your litter box has to go somewhere away from a receptacle."
2,this has problems,"I loved this when I first bought it, I hate cleaning the litter box. I even convinced several different people to buy this who had cats, but about 7 months after I bought this it broke. There is a little thin wire that can get wrapped around the rake and break. I didn't notice it because it happened one day when I was out. I came home to find it broken."
4,great product,"I just bought the littermaid self cleaning litter box... I have no complaints, it was a good investment for me.. I have 2 cats- the standard size is ok for the both of them, probably would be better with the mega size... The cats love it- once they here the motor go they run in and watch... It is a bit on the loud side but so far that is its only downfall..."
4,pretty pleased,"overall, i like the littermaid. we have one adult cat and one kitten, and they both adapted to it no problem. they like watching the rake do it's cycle and they've never gone outside the box. of course, they still kick up litter and make a mess, but they did that before with their regular litterbox.sometimes the rake gets stuck, and that is bad, but it's better than scooping three times a day.the only problem i have with it is that sometimes i forget about it because it's in a bathroom that's rarely used, and with two cats the recepticle fills up quickly and overflows. maybe a larger recepticle or some sort of seal for it so it doesn't make a mess? that would be good.oh and it's loud. that's lame too."
1,Broken Hinge Out of the Box,After picking up the LitterMaid Plus at a Target located 35 miles away I pulled the unit out of the box and discovered the hinge was broken. This was the right hand side hinge of the litter receptacle. The hinges are small plastic stubs and the break was along the edge of the door. Now I must take a return trip of at least 1 1/2 hours.I must say that I can not recall ANY product that was BROKEN BEFORE use.The quality is cheap. The parts seem to be weak and I would not doubt that the weight of my cat would probably break the door. This thing was on sale for $88 and I will get a replacement. WHY? Because it's the only thing on the market that can do this chore. My new cat does not cover her waste to well and I need something.
2,OK music,"This CD is listenable and has some nice music, but has nothing memorable. There is no rousing main theme that I expect from a soundtrack and many of the songs are not particularly good. If you are interested in music from this period, get the soundtracks to ""Last of the Mohicans, The Patriot, and A&E's Revolution"" (if you can find and afford that last one). Pass on this one."
2,"Good mouse, poor materials.","I love the features and looks on this mouse. The mouse wheel wore down in a couple months and got very smooth. This is fine for me, as I use the mouse every day and was able to get used to just the right amount of pressure to turn the wheel without pushing the button. Whenever someone new uses the mouse they get frustrated trying to get the scroll wheel working. The material on the side also tore off, ruining the otherwise slick design."
2,Used to love it - then it killed my motherboard,"I used this mouse for about a year - and loved it. I did have a few of the syncronization problems mentioned by others but usually you could get the mouse to work by rolling the scroll button rather than just moving it around.But last thursday, my USB ports all stopped working. When I unplugged the HP mouse - they worked again. THEN I made a stupid mistake. I kept trying to get the mouse to work. About the third time I plugged it into the PC, it fried the USB controllers for good. The plug and cable are fine (no bent pins, etc.) there is just something in my reciver module that shorted out the USB ports. Seems like this thing should be fused or something to prevent that.So now I have a new motherboard. I tried the mouse with the new motherboard just ONCE - to make sure (I know - risky - but I had to make sure it was the mouse causing the problem) Sure enough the new MB won't boot if the mouse is plugged in - boots fine without it."
1,Look elsewhere,"On a full charge, this mouse freezes up on the screen all the time. It comes back to life on it's own after a few mouse clicks and swirling the mouse on the pad - again, on a full charge.I'm going to buy something else. This thing is driving me nuts!"
1,"Ok quality, very overpriced","Bought several items from this brand and will never buy againOK quality but i cannot find a justification for the premium price as compared to competing brands (North Face, etc.)Also, important to note that their sizes are all over the place: some are US sizes, others European sizesFor instance, some of their items in Medium are really Small or even Extra Small"
1,Wrong Edition,"The order and packing slip you sent me said 2nd Ed. However, you sent me the first edition. Therefore, I had to return it."
4,Terrific!,"Hi there,I like something in the background when I'm doing serious, yet leisurely activities such as working on my photos, or freelance writing, or even cleaning the apartment! This collection of Great Westerns really fits the bill, and although I expected the programs to be good, it turns out they are even better than I anticipated.""Fort Laramie"" is so well written, and performed (right word?)it is nearly in a class of its own--these shows were far deeper and more interesting than cowboy yarns.Also exceptional are ""Dr. Sixgun"" (a far more sophisticated program that its title might indicate), ""Have Gun Will Travel"" (great title even!), and ""Gunsmoke"".The rest are superb listening as well, and only the omissions of ""Bobby Benson and the B-R-B Ranch,"" and Gene Autry make it lack 5 Stars--but I highly recommend this set to all OTR listeners."
3,'It COULD be for you...',"This CD is probably the only place you can find Shanice's 'It's For You', which was a favorite of mine back in the early 90's and still is. If it's worth it to you just like it was for me to have that 1 track regardless, get it if the price is right."
5,Intense Thriller,"If you like thrillers, I highly recommend Wages of Sin. It starts off easy like the southern summer day where it begins. Then the young couple's mistakes begin to compound, creating consequences more dire and acts more desperate until... (no spoiler here!). Wages of Sin is terrific across-the-board. A good story, excellent acting, and a well-crafted production combine to create a memorable and disquieting movie. Excellent job Little Dog Productions, I'm looking forward to your next one."
3,Good basic book in very simple language,"It is important to remember with any book you purchase regarding Aspergers and Autism that people on the Autism spectrum are not ""cookie-cutter-cases"". Each person is an individual and no book will cover ALL aspects. This book is written in a childs voice and is very easy to understand. Are you going to walk away from reading it profoundly enlightened? No. Are you going to have a more simplistic understanding of the day to day situations and life of a child with Asp? Yes. I purchased this book for my son's grandparents, his older brother and for him. It gives him a voice and something to relate too (not on all issues, but most). The book is extremely easy to read and fast. I read through the entire book in under an hour while helping my son with his homework. A great addition to your personal and lending library."
5,20 minute JEWEL,"I bought 3 copies of this book to pass around to family and friends...what a great decision! For adults, the book takes about 20 minutes to read. If your family and friends can't spare 20 minutes...then you're in real trouble. It is very basic, but very insightful. Everyone who I have had read it has been appreciative of the knowledge they've received. It's also a good resource for teachers. I plan to share it with each teacher who has any contact with my son."
5,"very basic, very useful","This is written about 3rd grade reading level, which made it perfect for my intended use. My older teenage son has shown many symptoms of Aspergers but hasn't ever been diagnosed. I had him read it and see if it identified his personality. He said yes by about a whopping 90%. Since, we have made an appt for him to be formally evaluated. Also, many of my friends have used the book. It is simple but useful for siblings and family to understand that these precious children see things different. I rated 5 stars because the book is excellent at which it is intended for! Simple but very useful."
4,Can I Tell You About Asperger Syndrome? : A Guide for Friends and Family,"Short and sweet, and very suitable - this simple story helps us expalin AS to our son (12) in a way he can understand, and has provided an uncomplicated way to introduce AS to family and friends. It is a really good springboard for more detailed discussions with those who either want to know more, or need to know more about AS."
5,"Excellent, easy read for family & friends","This is a very good book, written at about a sixth grade level and in plain terms but with good content to help anybody who is unfamiliar with AS to understand what it means to have AS."
4,good perspective,"Was helpful to my son. To give him ideas about explaining to others, whats its like to be autistic."
2,Wayyy overpriced,This should be .99 cent for Kindle edition. It's more like an informative brochure that's how short it is. Maybe the inflated price is because it's a kids book with a few stick like cartoons?
5,Just Like My Son,"Upon receipt of this book, my Asperger's 10 year old son and I immediately read it together. We were amazed at the similarities between he and the character Adam - the sensory integration issues, the social stigmas, and the exceptional abilities. Adam explains all of the things my son wishes he could.We shared this book with my son's teacher & principal, who both thought it was appropriate to share with the class. I recommend this book for sharing with classmates as well as relatives and friends."
4,A great compassionate perspective,"I really enjoyed this simple yet very compassionate perspective of a reality not that well understood. I live with NVLD ( a common attribute of Asperger's ) and it is wonderful to read a simple story that can help relationships flow easier. Every teacher and every class room should own a copy of this simple book, it is simple and very informative, I am very glad to have read it, it is a great resource, thanks!"
5,Fantastic book,"This book is a fantastic tool to use with family, friends, school personnel and your child's classmates to help explain in very easy terms what asperger syndrome is and how others can help the person with aspergers have a happy and fulfilling life. I have read this book to my son's last three classes since he was in 2nd grade, and it has really helped the students in each class better understand him. He is well liked, much better understood when his behavior might seem ""different"" or ""odd"" to the neurotypicals in his class, and one of his classmates even told her mom she was sure Jack would never be bullied because I have read this book to his classes and everyone loves Jack. I really can't say enough about this book. I have given copies to my son's case managers, teachers, one on one aides, school library, special ed department and countless friends who also have children with aspergers. I highly recommend this book!!"
5,Can I Tell You About Asperger Syndrome?,A very easy book to help understand the syndrome and excellent suggestions. It allows you to realize how it must be walking in their shoes and how to make them more successful. It helps knowing that it isn't the parents neglect in raising the child also.
4,Can I tell you I really liked this book,"I really liked this book for my son. He read it as a first introduction to his diagnosis he is ten. I also let family read it, it's really simple so that it just gives you an overview of the problems as asperger's kid faces. Remember it was written by one, but for an introduction to a child or family members who aren't going to read the OASIS book its great."
5,Amazing description of Aspergers,My Son was diaganosed with Asperger Syndrome when he was 8 years old. Family and friends did not understand the concept of Aspergers. I purchased this book for family and friends to read. Easy reading and explains it very simply and clearly. When my Son started asking questions about Aspergers I tried explaining it to him. He felt like something was terribly wrong with him. When he read the book he was relieved. He now understood why somethings are different about him compared to his classmates. His teacher had his classmates read the book and they now understand him better. Wonderful book!!!!
3,Not as well thought out as Luisi's Mahler First,"Luisi's performance is as compelling as almost anyone's...almost. But unless one is a Mahler devotee or an avid music collector, there are other, more vivid recordings one can find at low or reasonable cost.John J. PuccioClassical Candor"
3,"Good quality, good for a pre-schooler","We probably bought this product too early. It was a gift for our son's second birthday. He really likes it, but it doesn't get a lot of use. I think he will get more out of it as he gets older. The product itself is made nicely and is very durable (2 year old thinks it is a jungle gym)."
5,The Little Tykes Easal,"Great toy with unlimited variations in the fun you can have. Our two year old grand daughter uses it to place stickers on the drawing pad. She is also experimenting with the chalk and drawing some simple figures and text. But, I expect we will use this for many years as she expands her creative interests. Very sturdy. Went together well, probably took 30 minutes. Looked at a lot of easels, several in wood. This is by far the sturdiest."
3,Simple is sometimes the best,"Our daughter (she is 2) has one of these at her grandmother's house and uses it often. While it is not her favorite toy, she will frequently get up from whatever she is doing, go over to the easel, draw something, and sit back down.With no bells or whistles, literally, this toy just lets a child be creative. It is also much easier to draw on than the floor and you don't have to risk mishaps of writing on tables. Our only problem is that sometimes she forgets that markers and crayons are for the paper and not the blackboard."
1,BEWARE of chalkboard,"I have brought home 4 different easels, and ALL of them have had broken chalkboards. As another review said, it is a very sharp plastic material and can be very dangerous for young children. I'm going back again today to see if I can find another one that is not broken. The manufacturer needs to be aware of this defect!!!!"
2,poor construction,"My kids enjoyed this product but it has caused me some frustration. The clip isn't tight enough to hold a single sheet of paper, I had to use a booklet of painting paper to make it stay. If your child gets some on the side of the booklet, all the rest of the pages will stick together. The chalkboard isn't all that great either. It isn't a real chalkboard, it is made of some plastic material and it makes it hard to erase the chalk. However, there is one feature that I really like. You can remove the trays that hold the paints or chalk and wash them in your sink!!!! Overall, I don't really think this product is worth the money."
1,Terrible quality,"This is some of the worst quality I have seen. assembly was next to impossible, none of the holes are drilled in the right place, basically had to redrill all the holes. Clip only holds the paper up on one side. Awful!! Worst thing we could have bought. Don't waste your money."
1,Incomplete Packaging,"I purchased this product for Christmas along with chalk expecting the kids to love it. When I began assembly I found that it was missing several key parts.(blackboard,paper,and connecting rods).On my third day of trying, I was able to get through to Little Tikes. They would be happy to see if they had the parts once I proved (sales receipt mailed to Ohio)that I had purchased the item. Have you ever known anybody to shoplift a double easel? The point is that they made the error and it becomes my responsibility to prove it to them. I wonder how many people got up on Christmas morning and thought to scam Little Tikes out of an extra part for their easel. If I rate this product on use, it will be a negative number. This will be my last purchase of any Little Tikes product. My business goes to Step 2. If you stay with Tikes, check your boxes before you leave the store."
1,its not what we thought it was,My son said the double easel was nice but nothing came with it like paper or crayons. just what came was easer and chalk and nothing else. I think if you are going to puchase this item paper and crayons should come with it. I am very disappointed in this item.what are you going to do about it???
3,Easle,The easle is what I expected. The black board is not an actual black board. Its more like a black piece of plastic. It is hard to get the chalk off. The eraser that comes with the easle is extremely cheap and only smears the chalk around instead of getting it off. I found that a little dish soap gets it clean.
1,Not the one to go with....,"I would not buy this product or recommend it to other parents.Firstly, the construction is weak; a rivet fell off the chalkboard side not a week after we got it.But my main complaint is about the chalkboard itself. It is not a working chalkboard at all. It's essentially a piece of textured plastic that is very difficult to draw on with chalk, and is absolutely impossible to erase, even with a damp cloth.We bought this as an educational tool to help teach our children letters and numbers. Without a usable chalkboard we're basically going to have to buy another one, so this product was a complete waste of money.I would suggest asking around to parents to find out if they have one they like before buying one, but regardless of anything, don't bother with this one."
3,just okay,"I think I was more excited about this toy than my dog was. He's a ten week old mini dachshund and will play with it if I'm playing with it, but he never goes to the toy box and chooses it. When he does chew on it, he's only interested in the spiky rubber balls."
2,lasted 2 minutes,If you're pup is not a big chewer than this might be good for you. My little guy got through this in about 2 minutes. I had to toss it so he didn't eat anything from it.
1,Not worthy the money,"The only positive remark I have to say about this toy is that it is cute to look at. Well, it was cute to look at before my 7 pound dog (who is a chewer, I admit that) had the toy stuffing popped out and the little strand broken LITERALLY WITHIN 2 MINUTES! My advice is not to waste ur $$ like I did because it was a toy purposely made to chew, hence the name of the toy, but it fell apart the minute it was chewed on. Boo!"
5,new polar express,"Its about a train trip from Stockholm, Sweden to Narvik, Norway on the Atlantic Coast. If you like mountains and mountain scenery you will like this dvd. When you reach Narvik you can take a mail boat down to Bergen, Norway."
2,Kinda Boring,I was a bit disappointed with this film. From the title I had assumed I might be seeing some spectacular mountainous snow and ice scenes... but not one drop. It was just lots of trees and water - all very nice - but not what I thought I was getting. Also as one previous review states there were no decent shots of the train's interior apart from the observation dome and the bar. I know the idea is to sell the trip not the train but a bit more imagination and interest in the actual train I'm sure would give an added dimension to the feature that wouldn't be wasted on the viewers. The introductory data on Stockholm was interesting and there still are some pretty good panoramic vistas to see so all is not lost but for some reason not enough to get me to give it more than 2 stars.
4,Want to Stay Married,"The Divorce Lawyers' Guide to Staying Married presents real life matrimonial lawyers' views, based on their own experience with clients, on which practices best keep couples together. Those interested in saving their marriages will benefit greatly from adding this book to their repertoire. Sherri Donovan, Esq., author of Hit Him Where It Hurt$: The Take No Prisoners Guide to Divorce."
4,Good points,I felt it was a good piece of work with some good tips. I did not find the book to be as interesting as I was hoping for. But its a good read.
2,When Jews are Democrats,"This rabbi demonstrates what happens when Judaism is created by popular vote. No more commandments, no more tradition, no more loyalty; now we get suggestions, whats in, and dedication to what liberals want today. Even the spirited, interesting and clever drawings can't save this version of judaism-lite. Serious students of Judaism should look elsewhere for meaningful religion. The book reads like a boring dose of pool side chatter.Pass over this pampered, country club approach to Almighty G-d."
5,Modern Religion in America,This book was read as a religious school assignment by my whole class. We loved the quirky and delightful drawings and our group particularly liked the illustration of a rabbi flying off the page and out of the book. The author's suggestions on what it means to be a spiritual person are interesting and enlightening. Rabbi Tufts seems to encourage an almost effeminate approach to male spirituality that several of us found disturbing. Our class discussed the difference between accepting the femenine side to our male personalities and becoming a whimp. This book sparked much discussion and debate. Our religious studies class was not boring for a change.
5,Great Cultural Business Resource,"This was recommended by a friend in Russia as a good resource to prepare for an upcoming business trip. Ethics is a favorite study subject, and particularly so as related to how they translate in other cultures. This book has very practical examples and discussion of real business situations. Russia is an especially challenging environment in which to operate according to Western ethical standards, and this book addresses these head-on in thought-provoking terms."
4,El supremo follow up to Motown V-1,Not quite as strong as the first Motown boxed set but then again I'm partial to the earlier songs during the illustrious Motown of the '60s. 4.5 stars.
4,love that motown!,i love being able to listen to all my favorite oldies and wind down to the new classics. Shanice and Boys II Men add a special touch at the end. This is a collection that should be cherished and passed down.
