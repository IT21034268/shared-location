1,"Soccer, dirt bikes, soccer, dirt bikes ........",Shoot me if I'm wrong but isn't this series about horses. Even if they are perfect or phycotic it doesn't matter. I for one buy these books to read about horses not dirt bikes or soccer.
1,Where has all the racing gone?,This book was the most boring of the TB series. It was more about CHRISTINA'S problems with Dylan Chad and Katie than it was about horses doing anything-jumping or racing. The Subject of the book is Thoroughbred NOT Cristina's Love Life. I hope Joanna comes back because these books are going strait down hill.
5,Hey Girls,"Hey, I love this series, and I have every Number so far, but i have to say something that i am kinda dissapointed about. Did you all like number 19? Cindy's heartbreak? i liked it alot, it jerked a couple tears from me, and im wondering when the new authors will ask JOANNA for ideas, am i right? i mean i have # 1-31, and all of the Super additions, and if they want ME, another collector from America to keep collecting, and reading, THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO RACING! (No offence New Authors) So, come on, get some new ideas from Joanna, and get back into the 19's and lower topics!P.S. AND STOP WRITING ABOUT CHRISTINA ITS ANNOYING! I think you guys got something with Melanie! Write bout Mel, and have Ansylee and her get back together!!!P.P.S If Ne one knows what happened to Joanna Campbell, Please e-mail me with the topic as Thoroughbred C ya!"
1,1 star -,"I really didn't like this book AT ALL! I miss racing soooooo much! That is what mad the series fun to read. Ashleigh and Samantha were the best! I like eventing, but you can read about that in mostly any other horse series. I miss reading about Ash and Sam! Ever since number 24 I have not liked this series, but I kept reading, hoping it would turn back to racing and Ashleigh and Sam and it did in ""Without Wonder"" I started loving the series again! This book was about Dylan having to make a choice between his horse and Christina and sports...I didn't like it...byt maybe you will..."
2,hey it was ok!,"ok first off i didnt think this book was too great. i mean, i love the new authors but this book wasnt that great. i thought it was kinda stupid how Dylan was a jerk in this one. he acted like the biggest follower and he was mean to his horse. but i suggest you try reading the other books from #24 and beyond oh and stay away from the racing ones about wonder those ones are so stupid and ashleigh was a really boring character and so was samantha. but whatever floats your boat"
2,A Very Mixed Bag,"This DVD produced by (shudder) Madacy offers a very good Laurel and Hardy film (""Flying Deuces"") with a very, very poor one (""Utopia"", AKA ""Atoll K""). Bad picture quality (with compression) is evident on both films, along with wafer thin sound.The extras are typical of Madacy. There's a trivia game, filmography, and some biographies.All in all, you should stay away from this to find a better transfer of 'Flying Deuces.'"
3,flying duce/utopia laural and hardy,one the whole its not a bad film but it far from the best of laural and hardy films but if your a real fan you wont be that disapointed. HOWEVER....DURING THE FILM I DID NOTICE A SLIGHT DELAY IN THE SYNC WITH THE SOUND OF THE FILM!
2,Madacy ruins yet another classic DVD,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the studios really need to stop letting tiny, amateur production companies release their movies on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a prime example of why. The most obvious and infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synched up to the action; it's about 2 seconds behind. Unless you enjoy ""the boys"" looking like a dubbed Japanese movie, this is going to drive you crazy. The picture quality is also really poor; I have a VHS copy of ""Flying Deuces"" that looks better than this. The trivia game was a nice idea, but poorly executed; ""what color is Stan Laurel's hair?"" How would I know---all their movies are in BLACK AND WHITE! Oy. I thought I was getting a nice double feature for a good price, but I ended up getting what I paid for: cheap movies. Save your money."
2,utopia,i have been a fan of laurel and hardy for well over 50 years...it was and is sad to see the most beloved comics go out the way they did in their last movie...stan looked really bad since he was just recovering from illness...but nevertheless...i think all true laurel and hardy fans should own this dvd as a tribute to two of the greatest comdians that ever lived...thank youpatrick
4,Pretty good,"The dvd is fairly good. The picture still looks like a film but the sound for the Flying Dueces is fantastic. But, the sound for Utopia is bad. I have surround sound and it is really to loud, I can't seem to adjust it to a good point. The trivia games are fun and there are two short biographies that go along with each film. It is pretty good and isn't that expensive."
4,The best book on evidence,"My professor suggested this book and deemed it the ""Bible on Evidence"". I bought it and it is. A great book that will clear up many of your questions. If you don't understand what your law professor is saying, this book will make it clearer."
5,McCormick on Evidence,"It has a great plot, and the ending is a huge surprise. I won't spoil it by describing."
4,Prompt delivery and clean copy of the test.,The book arrived promptly and was in very good condition. I would use this vendor again.
5,Simon Raven- Good Unclean Fun,"Delighted to find other Simon Raven fans do actually exist!He's been a seriously neglected novelist because most of his novelshave been out of print for over twenty years. A revival is long overdue, particularly before the old boy drops off the twig...Fantastically well-written novels and sublimely well-chosen language. END"
1,Terrible!,"When I read the synopsis of this book, I was expecting something similar to Gary Hardwick's books. But, what I got were a lot of characters, a muddled-at-best plot, and a totally boring read. Gary Phillips had way too many characters in this book and trying to keep up with them felt like a job made for a police officer, NOT a reader. This is my first AND last book by Gary Phillips."
5,real music!!!,"This recording shows the musicianship of 5 great musicains.The writing, ensemble interplay, and improv that one heres on this recording is of the most musical, creative and heartfelt that's on the scene today.1) how many recordings have two incredibly talented,yet, stylistically different guitarists.2) mostly original music that keeps you involved every second3) a BAND sound!!! RARE these days...there are some bands around, but rare...a must have in your collection!!!"
3,Edition of Book,I ordered the 3rd edition of Fundamentals of Experimental Design and received the 2nd edition.
1,The reasons not to buy this book.,This is a poorly written textbook. The worst part is you have to buy the solutions manual separately and I can't find it anywhere.
1,Useless Class,"I will not say too much. I think it will be enough to quote from Ayn Rand's ""The Voice of Reason; Essays in Objectivist Thought"". The book written and the class taught by Glen Rodgers is ""perceptual level history, history as nothing but a torrent of unrelated, disintegrated concretes."""
4,Nice trainer,"This is a well constructed trainer. It works well and is very stable. Helps you stay upright while riding indoors. Getting ready for a bike tour in Europe, its the perfect tool. It has adjustable intensity. Has a bit of humming sound but it is not overly noisy. If you watch tv or listen to music with an MP3 it drowns it right out. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to train for biking or for someone who just wants some in-door biking exercise."
3,Good Value,Just as described. Works well. Compact. Noise can be a bit of an issue. Definitely gets the job done. Good work out.
5,Good for the price,This wind bike trainer is sturdy and stable. Its so quiet you can watch TV without turning the volume up or having to wear earphones. Its nice being able to leave the front wheel on and its very compact and east to store when not using it.
2,waste of money,"This trainer is stable, well built, and easy to assemble. however this thing is way to loud to use without disturbing others, watch tv, or hear a radio. Ultimately it wont get used because it is so loud and obnoxious that you just wont use it. do yourself a favor and buy a cheaper brand fluid trainer that you will actually use. the only thing this might be good for is warming up before an outdoor race."
4,Instructions could be clearer,"I'm not a cyclist. I purchased the CycleOps to use indoors during cold weather on a bike I was given. The instructions should be for ""dummies."" I took the bike apart when it was unnecessary. Cost me $18 to have it reassembled. Instructions for the CycloOps itself were very clear and I had no problem with assembling it. Just didn't realize that all I had to do was to set the bike on the CycleOps. It was too simple...but I didn't realize that. Egg on my face but I'm sure I'm not the only one out there! That said, I'm extremely pleased."
2,Fine but really loud,"I definitely agree with the other reviewer - this thing is pretty loud. I live in an apartment building and ended up shoving stuff under my door to quiet the noise. Unlike one reviewer, I could not hear a TV (even turned up) so I turned on CC so I could read what was being said. I am not a 'fast cyclist' by any means, but it was really loud at the faster parts of my workout.It was really easy to set up, and the resistance was really smooth. Overall, this would be fine if noise was not a constraint."
4,Better than expected,"After reading some of the negative reviews I was worried that this was going to be very loud and so on. Well, it's really not. You can't expect a stationary wheel that is turning like a windmill not to make any noise. The Cycleops works great. I can put enough tension on the wheel and gears to make it a great indoor work-out for the off season or bad weather. If you are looking for more that that I guess you will have to pay more. I think most people would find this suffient."
4,Duro Med Mboss sock and stocking aid with ridges.,"Duro-Med Mboss Sock and Stocking Aid with Ridges, BlueThe Duro Med Mboss Sock aid I would give it a 3 out of 4. A couple minor problems. One when you go to pull your sock on the ropes can slip through the clips as your pulling' so be sure to check them from time to time. Also the sock aid very rarely will pull the sock up over your heal. If your socks do not have the elasticity they used to it will pull them up father. My good socks it gets them up to the heal which is far enough for me to be able to get them."
1,Very Frustrating,"This book is very frustrating, they put the Japanese text in tiny lettering, they have this really nice page and they barely use any of it for the text. Look at the first page and you'll see what I mean, not only is the text very small, but it's crammed in the lower right hand corner of the page, into the crease in the book. The translation is lousy, the book opens up with ""mukashi, mukashi"" which should be translated as""long long ago"", but they have a completely different English text that does not correspond properly. A lousy book if you're trying to learn Japanese. I found a much better version on line for free at ""The Japanese Page"". Don't waste your money on this poorly presented and horrible translated junk. Who ever approved the layout of this book should be fired for incompetence."
5,"detailed tips, photos, and tools","This book is so fun I can't stop reading it. The descriptions of techniques are excellent, and the illustrative photos are even better. I'd say it's the next best thing to taking a live lesson in sand sculpture! It's really going to enrich my weekends this summer. I recommend this book to anyone who is going to be spending any amount of time on any beach in the near future."
2,Not So Simple Sand Castles,"I found this book beyond what I wanted to get involved with;especially with my seven year old. This book is geared for the serious sandcastler. For setting up your sandcastle base, it recommends using roofing paper & other tools that I'm not quite ready to carry out to the beach. It is interesting, but for the serious sandcastler. Not the casual kid builder."
5,So that's how they do it!,"This is a wonderful book for sandcastlers who want to take their bucket-shaped castles to a new level. With just one read through, my 1 foot high by 2 feet wide castles went to almost 3 feet high by 2 feet wide! You just have to learn how to make the sand behave properly. Thanks, SandyFeet!"
5,Great cooler,"This is one nice cooler - large but not too large, great lid, nice handle design, wheels... For about a year is has been used an abused - left outside in scorching heat or freezing temperatures, dragged in grass, on the deck stairs or the gravel driveway, and after a nice wash it still looks almost new. Never leaked, both wheels are still tight, and the handles are intact and strong. Now, I have not tested this too see if it keeps the ice for days, but for my needs (occasional picnic, groceries during summer, or just cooling some brewskies) this is perfect."
5,Won't ever buy a different cooler again!,"Love this cooler and can't imagine ever buying a different brand again! We hardly had to buy any ice on our 8-day camping/road-trip - great not to have to worry about our food going bad! However, it is available for $40 at Kmart - $25 savings!"
3,"Great insulator, poor cover hinges.",I've used two of these coolers for over five years. The cooler insulates and contents remain cool for at least two days with ice (14 lbs). The plastic hinges that connect the top lid and the cooler side pulls the cooler skin away from the lip that the hinge is mounted on. This is a design flaw. If you buy this unit be careful not to open the lid to far or you will damamge the body of the cooler at the hinge mounts.
5,Quality cooler for the right price,"I've had this cooler for about 8 months now, and I have zero complaints. It seals very tightly, and the drain valve doesn't leak. When you fill it with ice and keep it out of the sun, it will keep your food/drinks cool for several days. The wheels and lift up handle are a nice bonus as well.The only minor issue I have against it is that the drain valve isn't located at the lowest point on the cooler, and you have to tilt the cooler and shake it around to get the last of the water to drain out. It's not really a huge problem, though.If I ever need a second cooler, I'll definitely buy another one of these."
3,"Its just another cooler, nothing special at all",Dont buy into the hype. This does no better job than any other cooler I have ever had.And it leaks water around the drain.(I fixed that with silicone.)But the ice last just the same as any other cooler.Its an OK product but thats all. (I do like the wheels)
2,Not as advertised,Does not keep Ice for more than 24 hrs. Purchased for a camping weekend and by the by the third day all of the ice was melted and food room temperature. Would not recommend.
1,Coleman cooler leaks bad,"After talking to Coleman they said they would replace it in 6-7 WEEKS. The customer rep I talked to said she hadn't heard of any problems but she immediately knew what was wrong and how they would fix it. Never heard of the problem? Huh? I wonder how many trunks, car seats and floors have been swamped by their new coolers. You might want to check yours too."
4,Good cooler,"I don't really have any of the ""X day"" coolers to compare this to, but it did keep our food and beverages cold for 4 days while camping. We had large freezer packs plus ice in there and I did have to replace the ice on the 3rd day. There was some melted ice, but not that much and I drained that water off and replaced the ice. Everything stayed nice and cold. The wheels are definitely a nice feature for a cooler this size."
3,Does its job but could be better,"This is a spacious cooler which is why I bought it despite having another one with a handle and wheels. It does keep things cool but as other reviewers have said, the ice does all melt and would only remain unmelted to a certain degree after a day and half if one were to keep it out of the sun or heat (not left inside a warm car). My experience was just that - I had to buy new ice after day 1 (after having traveled for 9 hours in an air-conditioned car non-stop).I also agree with other reviewers that what prevents this cooler from allowing cold air to stay trapped inside of the unit are three reasons: 1. the thinner lid (thicker ones provide more insulation and hot air rises to the top as we learned in science class), 2. the fact that there is nothing lining the edges of the lid so when it closes, it's airtight and 3. one must use a strap to clamp the lid tightly downwards (there isn't enough weight on the lid to seal the cooler tight)"
3,Coleman 62-Q xtreme Wheeled Cooler,"read quite some reviews on this one before buying. All in all, it's a good product. we took one short trip with it and it works well. We can not use the cooler with our Honda Civic. It can not fit into the trunk because of the cooler's height. wish I thought about that before buying. Instead we have to drive a SUV if want to use it. also, wonder why the drain hole is located in the front below the handle. It may be more convienent if the drain hole opens in the rear. Perhaps this is just a personal preference?"
1,Not deserve even one star,"The lid cover was loosen and taken off on the first day of my camping trip. Coleman used a tiny and cheap bolt to tighten the hinge and it is a complete mistake. There is a wide gap between the cover and the container; then, I found tens of ants in the cooler whenever I open the lid. Best product for those who wants worst experience."
5,"Sturdy, roomy","This cooler has minimum space invasion due to the axel and wheels, leaving a cavernous cooling area that's perfect for holding fridge contents during a power outage. I know this from personal experience, sadly. Keeps things cold as expected. Very good buy."
4,Nice cooler,This is a nice cooler to drag around at picnics and cookouts. I'm getting too old to carry a chest full of food and beverages so this was my answer. It makes a nice bench as well.
3,Cooler is Ok But Have Had Better,This cooler will keep my ice for about a day or so but not much longer. I use it in the house which can get a bit warm in the summer but it still does not keep ice for as long as I had hoped. I freeze my ice in fairly large food storage container size blocks and these will usually disappear in about 24 hours or so. I just use it for canned beverages and it is opened maybe three or four times a day.
5,great ice chest,I would reccomend this for keeping all foods/liquids cold. The cooler has wheels for easy transport and very spacious inside. I had heard about this in magazines.
3,"ok quality, great price","Pull along handle is flimsy, but rest of cooler is well constructed, top is rigid. I bought this for camping ice last 2 days in moderate temperatures in the shade doubt it last 5 days unless packed with only ice."
5,great cooler,either my older cooler was dead or this one is fantastic or both.. it holds ice like forever.. i bought 2.. highly recommend.. the only bad.. after my first use as i cleaned it the hinges broke??? but coleman had new ones in days...lovin it..
3,Good except for leaking drain valve,Nice size with plenty of interior space for tall bottles. Doesn't seem to hold ice any longer than my other coolers. Drain leaks...so don't put it in the back of your car without a plastic bag.
2,bad cooler,The cooler should be taken of the market. It was supposed to keep ice for several days at 90% One DAY was best. I picked one end and a pin poped out and the handle came off. I will never buy coleman again. I am very unhappy with product
3,Not suited for Texas summer,"This cooler doesn't keep ice past 24 hours in the Texas heat, even in the shade. Otherwise, it's a decent cooler, but if you live where it gets over 85 degrees and you don't want to make a daily ice run, look elsewhere."
1,Flimsy broken handles,I bought three of these coolers. Within 2 months the handles had broken on two of them. They look nice and keep food cold as expected but do not hold up. I think that for this price there should be a warranty on them or assistance since they failed so shortly after purchase.
5,Perfect for saltwater fish,Unusual use for cooler on wheels. I have a 125 gallon salt water fish tank and change 10-13 gallons of water weekly. This is the perfect size and rolls to the tank for an easy exchange of water. Very pleased with purchase and delivery.
3,Don'r count on the short handles....,"Functionally, these are GREAT Coolers, you can pack them just as advertised. And the long tow handle opposite the wheels also works great. However, positioned between the tow handle is a lifting handle. Actually, the cooler has a pair of these handles for lifting. We order two of these coolers. From their first use the left side retaining pins connecting the lifting handles to their brackets (between the tow handle) popped out on both during lifting. We were able to put them back, but they continued to fail during lift. We loaded the coolers exactly as advertised, then added ice. Perhaps it wasn't really capable of load bearing.From an insulation/ cooling aspect-they worked great! Kept our ""frosty beverages"" icy cold 24 hours at a time. You can't beat the price-just be aware of the handles."
4,"Works well, has a couple of flaws","This is a great cooler; I love the handle and it pulls very well. I just wish it had 4 wheels. Also, it seems irrational that Coleman put the drain valve at the handle end, rather than the wheeled end. That would make it much easier to drain. That said, this is a great cooler, isn't too big and keeps stuff cold. The lack of wheels on one end does make it handy if you want to sit on it."
4,Good insight to the world of Drag Kings around the globe,I found this book very informative and the pictures are awesome. It is a good look at the lives and lifestyles of Drag Kings. Some of the ladies look so much like men and have been photographed so well one would never believe what really lies under their shirts.:-)
3,Very confusing,Who am I to review Thomas Hardy? I have read almost all of his novels and this was one I had not read. It was so confusing and really got boring during the last third of the book.
5,Don't understand why his CDs are so cheap.,Gary Lamb is a great musician. All 10 songs were beautifully composed and played. He may not be a good looking guy but his music speaks volume.
4,These Q-tips looked like they were already used!,"Just kidding, that's gross.They're cotton swabs that you stick in your ears, what else can I say?"
4,"Oh, no! Cheaper on Amazon than at my local chain drugstore!",I am so pissed that my local store sells this for a DOLLAR more than Amazon. I agree that the quality of the stem of the swabs as deteriorated but I use these more than ever because I have discovered that they go great up one's nose as well as in one's ears. I'll never go back to the more frugal but gnarly experience of using my fingers to remove detritus.
5,The Q-tips are better than the other brands ...,The Q-tips are better than the other brands out there. They have a nice cotton swab that is able to handle many other tasks other than what they are made for. The swabs are soft to the touch so that they are able to handle delicate areas of the face besides the ears.
5,Nothing but Qtips by Brand ...,"Early in my married days we were living, well let's call it, a low-income life. With a baby on the way I picked up another (lower-cost) brand. The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget."
5,What has two balls and a long shaft? a Q-tip!,Good 'ole Q-tips. none of the other brands can quite compare...I use em for everything from personal hygiene to cleaning small delicate items.
1,Qtips now suck...,"Size matters when it comes to cotton swabs. I've always spent the extra money to buy Qtips brand swabs, BUT NO MORE. My wife and I have noticed that the once large and fluffy cotton heads are now gone. There is NOTHING less satisfying than sticking what feels like a match head in your ear canal after a good hot shower. I've even tried 'fluffing' up the heads, but there's not even enough cotton on the tips anymore to do that! Very unfulfilling and all to save a buck - I'll take my earwax elsewhere..."
1,They want to be Led Zeppelin but ...,"Flower Travelin' Band is sometimes referred to as the Japanese Led Zeppelin. This is a genuine description of their aspirations but where Led zeppelin actually understood things like compposition and songwriting, alas, these guys either have no clue or just no interest. So what we have here is a lot (and I mean a LOT) of endless jamming, usually over the same riff repeated endlessly. Not particularly good riffs to boot. Not too different than 4 stoned blues-rock dudes jamming in the garage in the 70's (in the US OR Japan, I guess)."
5,a great gift for a Rockin' dad,"The quality was good, no problems with the sound and arrived within the given date. The price was cheaper than purchasing it in JP. Well done!"
4,prog rock,"If you are an afficionado in the prog rock domain, and want to hear some really good stuff, sounding like early whatever and fresher than before, choose Satori. It is progressive rock in its uttermost form, being acid and trance together with jazz and vibe. Get down and get with it! And yes, it IS avant-garde! Gems from Japan!"
5,777 Stars,"Amazon doesn't have a rating sufficient for this record. Mind- blowing, soul-smashing classic."
5,I've only heard Part 1 But It's DANK,I've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKI've only heard Part 1 But It's DANKduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhduh na nuh nuhOOOOEEEEEAAAAAEEEEOOOOOEEEEOOOO OOOAAAAReally it does Rock.
3,Strange video encoding detracts from an otherwise good DVD.,"The quality of the video encoding is very good, except for some strange changes in video speed that occur every few minutes. The scenes will either speed up or slow down for a few tenths of a second. Very annoying."
4,Cutting edge television,"This quirky and amusing series anticipates other engaging shows -MOONLIGHTING and THE X FILES come to mind - with its saucy dialogue and double meanings, not to mention the idea of a man and a woman sharing equal roles in the plot lines."
2,"Technically Great, Emotionally Lacking","I would strongly recommend the Lindsay Quartet performance over these. While flawlessly played here, the impact of the music is sterile. The tempos are often rushed as the players know the notes, they just don't really impart the music."
4,A word to the wise,The book looks wonderful - but it came without the patterns. I would suggest that you ask the seller to double check the book to make sure the patterns are included before shipping.
4,Grandmother's Delight,"This book tells you how to dress that special friend of your grand daughter with stylish outfits. Simple patterns for a variety of clothes are presented along with clear instructions for simple sewing. There is a wide range of styles included, from sport clothes to elegant dress up. What more could any little girl want?"
4,Very good value for the money.,"This book contains full-sized patterns to create the garments featured, along with construction information. Outfits are your basic wardrobe for the 18"" dolls covering all the seasons, and a great staring point for the new collector. Full color photos are a nice touch!"
2,No patterns,The book is great but because it was used the patterns were not with it even though the listing said they were. Very disappointing. Without the patterns the book is practically useless.
3,It was in the details but I was so thrilled that I didn't notice it had no patterns...,BUMMER! I should have read through the details better... I got the book only and no patterns... NOT really worth my money because I am not able touse the book w/o the patterns... BUT I am to blame for this not the seller... This was a used book to begin with...
3,discription does not fit,"Length:: 0:09 MinsThis pillow is too thick for someone who has had neck surgery- like myself,picture is misleading of the produce. I would say this pillow is about 5""-6"" thick, instead of what the picture looks like 2 1/2"" to 3""."
5,An Excellent Resource,"I am always very interested in apologetics, and this book is clearly the best defense of the traditional understanding of the eucharist. I agree with all of the positive reviews, and I wanted to bring to your attention some books that will further your study of the meaning of the eucharist and fellowship. These books will really help you draw out the ecclesiological implications of the eucharist and the liturgy. Enjoy!""The Eucharist Makes the Church"" by McPartlanEucharist and CHurch Fellowship in the First Four Centuries"" by Werner""Sacrament of Salvation"" by McPartlan"
2,A thick book but ...,"Nothing new under the sun. A lot of scripture verses, church fathers, councils etc. but the arguments are a bit sterile. This book left me nearly cold. It's only something for (catholic) mind, but not for the heart."
2,Disappointed in lack of Author's view,"Read this for a class with Custerology and Rez Life - both of which I would recommend. Shades of Hiawatha though, was more like reading a mixture of what many others had said before. I wish the author would have spent more time developing own opinion, own words, own viewpoint and message to share with the reader.I enjoyed reading about the photographers and their views of Native Americans, what if anything they wanted to accomplish, but I hated that this was only a small portion of the book. Most of the books seemed to be in quotes."
2,A Book About Alan Trachtenberg,"Do you know how clever Alan Trachtenberg is? I mean, do you really, really know?! Because if not, this book is for you. Trachtenberg's book is only superficially about Indians or Americans, it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things--because he is very clever, you know. In so far as this book has a thesis, that it is it."
2,Dahlgren discredited,"Dahlgren's thesis, that the islands depicted on dozens of pre-Cook globes and maps dating from the 1500s, were actually part of the Marianas Islands has no credibility. The Marianas are depicted on all these globes and maps where they are - nearly 4,000 miles west of Hawaii. Further, his conclusion is refuted by numerous authorities including La Perouse, Herb Kane, the staff of the Madrid Naval Museum, the late journalist Bob Krause, Wendell Carlsmith, Capt. Richard Rogers and author James Jarvis. In his ""Legends and Myths of Hawaii"", King Kalakaua noted that during the pre-Cook reign of Kamaluohua a ship was wrecked off Hawaii with five survivors. Oral Hawaiian histories noted pre-Cook foreigners landing there. That is but a handful of evidence disputing Dahlgren and supporting the conclusion that the Spanish arrived in Hawaii first."
2,Better as a Video,"Purchased on a whim after seeing a VH1 video. Not quite as interesting as I had hoped. One or two tunes may be worth a listen and a down-load,..don't buy the entire CD."
4,Never stops grooving,"Even after 9 years, this album is still the jam. Never Stop is one of my favorite songs of all time. Dream Come True and Stay this Way are classic too. The album funks from beginning to end. Check it out!"
1,Old book,Very old but my neice learned somthings- but with Digital cameras everything is so different.
1,baaaaad!,"I couldn't finish more then 5 minutes of the movie because the quality was so poor, picture watching a tv show with bad reception and it is probably better then this"
1,It is ashame,"When I purchased my DVD player this Bruce Lee film set was one of my first DVD purchases. What a disappointing waste! I am glad this DVD set wasn't my first exposure to Bruce Lee or his films. If it were, I never would have become as big a fan as I feel that I am. The sound is ludicrous -I mean it is insulting. The picture quality was so bad that at first viewing, I kept cleaning my glasses in dis-belief. I simply couldn't watch this #@*`! Don't waste your money like I did; then again it is your money. And some people don't believe #@*` stinks until they smell it. If you wish to see these truly exciting films I would suggest you try some other format or producer (which ever comes first). I threw this set away -after I vented my disappointment on it with a pair of scissors."
1,"Great movies, Bad DVD","Buy a better version of these classics, this DVD should be avoided at all costs. If you like the movies, you'll feel insulted by the horrible sound and low quality transfer."
1,JUNK!!! Need I say more!!! A complete waste of $!!!,"Sad,Sad,Sad!!! Two great Bruce Lee flicks on two crappy DVD's!!! These look much worse than SLP VHS tapes!!! A complete waste of money!!! Avoid these at all costs!!!BOO!!!"
1,mismatch,"the photo posted as of October 10, 2012 does not match the product description. The photo posted appears to have a compression connection for 1/2 inch (Raindrip nominal) line on the right, and possibly hose thread on the left. This is not remotely 1/4 inch barb, as described."
5,I always wondered how much those gagets cost...now I know Wile was rich!,"Need a clever disguise? or perhaps a pocket-sized anvil? ACME has it, and now they're reaching a bigger audience, reality. Filled with wonderful illustrations and humor, this book is a must-have for anybody who is a cartoon fan....or just needs a catalog to put onto the coffee table."
4,"Good ""Looney"" Fun","If, like me, you grew up chuckling at old Warner Brothers cartoons, you'll get a kick out of this book. The illustration style is a bit weird - items are shown as 3D objects, rather than in the cartoon style you'd expect - but the book is entertaining. I'd recommend it to any fan of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner!"
4,The Acme Catalog,"If you watched the Roadrunner and the Coyote cartoons as a kid ,or even as an adult, you will enjoy this book.It is written as if it is the actual Acme catalog that Wile E.Coyote ordered from .It has 94 pages of very nice illustrations done in early 50's ad style colours,complete with information like an actual catalog including cautionary warnings and shipping prices .From the Acme Boomerang to Instant Tunnel Paint you will enjoy seeing many of the funny gadgets from the cartoons ."
2,"Tiny, outdated","To call this pamphlet ""a book"" is an exaggeration. It is very small - about 5.5 x 8.25 inches and contains a single tree per page (only 64 pages), along with minimal information. Anyone familiar with the rich diversity of the tropics - Caribbean, South America, Central America, Mexico - knows that 64 pages is cutting the topic short by a good deal. Printed in 1965, most copies you will find (despite being labelled ""good"") are aged and yellowed. Unless you are desperate for this book, anything over [dollar amount] is robbery."
3,"Small, but useful guide to many tropical trees","Compact enough to use as a field guide, this booklet will assist the curious traveler through the tropics, as well as residents planning a garden. Multiple photos of the 60+ trees described here provide ample information for easy identification, with full-size and detail pictures included. In my older copy, there is some fading, but the brilliant colors of the flowering trees are still awesome. Alphabetized for easy use, the text offers the tree's name in several languages, where it is most commonly found, and interesting historical facts as well as some usage suggestions. For newer photos and some updated information, seeOrnamental Plants & Flowers of Tropical Mexico."
3,too bad it does not fit my psp!,"ok, so I bought this for my son and was sad to find out that it did not fit his PSP which I had just purchased in June 2008. I did not know they made different models of PSP and the site does not say it only takes one type. On the bright side they refunded my money right away, but I still had to pay the shipping charges and spend the time dealing with all of this..."
1,A typical old western with a formulaic plot.,"I found these movies to be extremely formulaic. The plot wasn't all that bad though and seemed to at least move. The most disappointing factor of all is that it's on DVD and the sound is terrible. You can't understand half of what they say. It sounds like they recorded off of a bad speaker that keeps popping. At one point the film even scrolls. Disappointing use of media, okay plot, excellent for camp value."
3,The horses are still the stars,"Please realize that these b-westerns were made in the 1930's to be weekly entertainment. We didn't have TV's and the movie was king. However, times have changed. Is this movie still worth watching? Yes.The Star Packer has one plot gimmick-a hollow tree trunk in the middle of a road in a western town. Once you accept the tree trunk, the movie is actually a decent movie. The story doe not bog down and keeps moving. A westrern has to have some good horse riding in it, and there are some good western action scenes which includes a couple of horse chase scenes. If you like this movie, you might like another early Wayne movie titled ""Desert Trail."""
2,Just click on the photo.,"The 4 John Wayne films listed on this DVD are ""riders of destiny,starpacker,sagebrush trail and man fom Utah"".It is just his 1930s b-grade films and not really worth buying."
2,Not as expected,This DVD was hinted as being in color it was'nt. I would have liked for the discription to have been a little more discriptive.
4,Short but useful reference,"This is a short pamphlet that covers signatures on japanese swords. It lists common signing styles, characters used in smith names and inscriptions, titles, province names, and era names. It is a useful reference for decoding signatures.It's biggest drawbacks are that the character list is not alphabetized, the characters are all shown in their ""correct"" form, which is often quite different than the form used in a signature, and the discussion of the different styles of signatures is minimal.If you're looking for a general reference book, start with Yumoto's book, or Yoshihara & Kapp."
2,cat bells,These are not cat bells. These bells are huge. They might be appropriate if your cat is a tiger or a lion.
4,Nasty stuff,"Snarling, taunting, creepy and dirty back-alley music, but this one's unfortunately not as dirty as they sound live... which is why it misses 5 stars with me. Reference points include the Velvets, the Cramps, Richard Hell, the Dolls, filtered through the Shangri-Las maybe."
3,Himuro  - Nichiyobi,"NICHIYOBI starts of with the fast, crisp breaks of ""Gacha Gacha,"" and it maintains the pace throughout. Even the woozy start of ""Bell Bottom Beats"" gives way to a rhythm overload. ""Tea For One"" does slow things down, and ""Get the Controller"" blips into pleasant chiptune silliness. But ""Monster Mushroom"" brings back the big beats, but, as evidenced by ""Do Not Disturb"", ""Funky Bugyo,"" and ""On-Pu,"" Himuro isn't above playing around with perky little melodies either (or, for that matter, mad jazz, as on ""Used Music""). The sonic streaks of ""Open/Close"" liven up the heavy bass there, and he alternates a gentle guitar strum with mad rhythms on ""Full Blast."" This kitchen-sink approach to sound doesn't always work, however, especially when the aggressiveness overwhelms everything, but in small doses, it's not too bad."
4,Get Al's Books Back In Print!!!,"This book, in it's original edition ,was an early purchase of mine from ESP Lab. A few years ago, we used the spell to get someone out of your life on an assistant manager who'd fired him and was disputing his claim for unemployment compensation.She wasn't allowed to represent the restaraunt at the legal hearing (reason unknown!).They lost the hearing, and we heard later that neither the a.m. or the flunky worked there anymore.For all his spelling errors or foibles, Al was a very effective metaphysician and his work should be available.Btw, Azazel isn't a demon, it was the scapegoat that bore the sins of the Israelites into the desert. I've also had no encounters with bad spirits as a result of his work.Parker Publishers required all those endorsements of all their authors. They annoyed Al, too!For information on how to help get Al's books back in print, please go to the ESP Lab website."
1,Used car salesman meets witchcraft.,"This is a positive book. Very positive. In fact, I got really tired about hearing the next anecdote of how so-and-so changed their life by mixing up just the right spell. Manning could be a TV preacher extolling the virtues of faith healing--it sounds just the same! It's a matter of style--if you like testimonials, you'll like this book, and it does have some good information on magical spellworking in it. Nothing even vaguely spiritual or religious, though. And I personally felt like I was coated with a thin layer of snake oil when I finished it..."
2,Helping yourself with white witchcraft,"There is some good information here but I got real turned off by the ""infommercial"" tone and the testimonials. All but the Thought form spell one can get in better books."
1,Bad spirits appear!!!,When I used the Nature Spirit spell in the book all sorts of bad things started happening to me afterwards and I felt the presence of evil in my house. I ended up moving because I knew everytime I went home evil was waiting for me. Don't mess with this stuff! The book sounds good but it unleashes bad spirits.
4,Tar Beach,"Tar Beach allows Cassie Louise Lightfoot to dream while her parents play cards on the roof. The book demonstrates how children use their imagination to solve problems. In addition, Cassie Louise Lightfoot wants to help her father by giving him parts of New York. In other words she wants to help him avoid working for a union. Finally, the author also presents illustrations of quilts that she has made and learned from her grandmother, who had been enslaved."
4,Picture books don't fit the same categories as chapter books,"This is a picture book in the style that I call ""dreamy"". The girl is dreaming about flying through the city, wearing the bridge her father helped build as a necklace, giving him the union building he can't join because of his race and so on.There's no real storyline, just her thoughts as her family goes up to ""tar beach"" (the roof of her house - I did that as a child, and sometimes regret that my nieces have a nice yard but no walking-on roof!) to laugh and be together and have fun.This book would be very appropriate for bedtime. That's why I call this style of book ""dreamy"", in fact. Pick up a copy, you'll see what I mean."
1,Cheap made in China crap.,"I ordered a pair of these because of the price, and they were damaged when I recived them. One of the steps was dented and scratched. Amazon gladly let me return them and sent me another pair right away. Unfortunately, these were dented also. Smittybilt use to be good quality products, but just like everything else anymore, they are made in China, and the quality shows. Spend a little bit more and find something made in the US."
5,love this brush,my hair is thick and long but it makes it flip on the ends with little or no product. my curls stay until i shampoo!
5,well made,This knife is very well made. Nice and heavy carrying case is sturdy as well. Very good purchase for the price
3,a tournament in history,NOT SO BAD FOR KENNEDY BUT ONLY QUICK SHORT ARCHIVES OF THE FABS INSIDE FOR THIS TOURNAMENT OF HISTORY !
2,sigh dissapointed kinda,I wanted this album for a while but once i got it it was more hype than anything. theres only one decent part on the whole album. when black c and t lowe put it down for 2min on song number eleven which was the only decent song. the dru down was ok sounded like an intro and was waiting for him to drop it. all in all i give it 2 out of 5.
4,Where to Start and What to Ask,The book was very informative with a great deal of information. It was easy to read and understand - very user friendly. The information was timely and well put together.
4,...and also how,"The author lists all the items you should try to elicit in mental status exams, first referrals, etc. but gives you ideas how to work it into a natural level of interaction and not working off some checklist. I find myself turning to some chapters repeatedly."
4,Good.,"The book was in great condition. Saved money from buying it from Amazon also. However, the content was not that helpful. There are other books out there that provide the same information in a better way."
5,Best Help So Far for Learning Disabilities,"Tutoring became a part of my life a few years back, and I struggled to help adult students with a learning problem. Finally, someone recommended this book and I ordered 2, one for my student and 1 for me, and I can see the lightbulb come to my students eyes, and she sees the same in me. What a better recommendation than that!!"
5,This book has changed our lives!,Ron Davis' personal experience with Dyslexia helped him discover what CAN be done about it. A must-have for any parent desperate to find help for their dyslexic child.
2,not what I had in mind,"I wished I hadn't started highlighting in this book, so I could send it back. It's not bad, just not what I wanted. My niece has dyslexia and I am an elementary school teacher. I can't picture using this with my niece or students. I was looking for a better understanding of dyslexia and some classroom accommodations. This is mostly a new method for CURING dyslexia. Maybe I should have read the book description better. Since this is a relatively new theory, I found myself evaluating whether or not I even believed what was being presented. I can see a parent who is at wit's end trying this method to see if their child can be cured. The testimonials sure are encouraging."
2,The Gift of Dyslexia,Very informative and well written but it is NOT a self-help book. It's a good book to help your kids or students but if YOU are the dyslexic seeking help for your self this is not the book for you.
2,Dyslexia a gift?,"After reading this book several times I am still unsure how Dyslexia is a gift. I found this book to be controdictive, and confusing, many of the statements do not correctly represent many dyslexic people."
1,"Davis Didn't Do Didley for Me 'Cept Make $2,300 Poorer","Not only did I read the book, but as a severe ADHD/dyslexic, I was eager to risk $2,300 to do the program.Well, I was 38 when I did this program and all it did was make me $2,300 poorer.What little value I got out of it was almost identical to Peter Bisonette's speed reading course, which cost me only $200.To be honest, I have met individuals who swear by him and the weeklong workshop.But I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone."
4,Don't Be Scared by the Bigwigs,"Some of the bad reviews for this book are scarey to read if you are a mom trying to help your child. They say it goes against scientific evidence and they use a lot of big words to make their case. My advice is to buy the book and try the Davis method for yourself. It worked for my 8 year old daughter and it is not cumbersome or complicated. After just the first ""Orientation"" session she went from reading one paragraph with 20 mistakes, to reading the same paragraph with NO mistakes. I've also called the helpline at the back of the book whenever I got stuck implementing the program and they were always happy to give advice. If you are wading in a scientific sea of information on how to help your dyslexic child, this is one method you should not be afraid to try. It just might by the thing that works for you. Wouldn't you trade all the ""scientific evidence"" in the world for just one book that might help your child to read?"
2,Nice looking but flimsy,"I bought a couple of these for my son and his friend because they were inexpensive, a unique design (for wooden swords), nice looking, and I didn't have time to make something similar myself. Unfortunately you get what you pay for. The pommel fell off one of them during shipment. Nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but disappointing nevertheless. They are made from decent hardwood and the routing is quite nice but the ""blades"" are quite thin, fragile, and (shockingly) rather sharp. For small children this is an accident waiting to happen. For older kids like my son it means that they can't do much with it since it is so delicate. Nice to look at but that's about it. Better glue and a bit thicker design would be much more useful. Given how they are built, however, I'm really not sure what they are designed for. They are not quite nice enough to display yet are too flimsy to use."
2,Broke on impact,I bought this and a different sword to fight with because I'm a nerd. The other sword was awesome and stayed intact but this one did not and shattered after a few blows. Also when I first got it a nail was sharp and sticking out. Don't recommend.
3,not for actual practice,"This sword was allot flimseyer and roupher then the picture shows, its only good for display and it took some sanding and staining for it to be presentible as a retiment gift."
1,Beware non-Columbia Stooges videos,"The four movies included in this set -- 'Disorder In The Court', 'Malice In The Palace', 'Sing A Song Of Six Pants' and 'Brideless Groom' -- are in the public domain, which means anyone with recording equipment and a copy of the movie can release their own video. Frequently, the results are of poor video/audio quality (although the movies themselves are quite good -- 'Brideless Groom' is one of the funniest Stooge comedies ever). Columbia has just released an 'official' Stooges DVD (with six of the films on one disc) -- hopefully the first of many. Stick with Columbia, and avoid these cheap knock-offs."
2,If it seems too good to be true...,"The selection of shorts is only fair, the video quality poorand there are just two 25-minute shorts on each DVD! Almost enough todissuade me from trying other Stooge DVD's."
5,How to have a birthday party,"This book is very much like the ""Rageddy Ann's Tea Party Book"". It tell how the dolls go about arranging a Birthday party for a new doll. Along the way it gives ideas and details on how to do things for the party. How to bake and decorate the cake, decorations, and home made gifts. My daugther loved it. We read it rigth there in the store because we couldn't wait to get home. I bougth one to donate to our school libary. Her classmates loved it also."
3,Boring effort from a good band,"This has the same great formula as Ultraglide in Black minus somebody else writing their songs. And it shows. While the energy is really enjoyable right out the gate, when it slows down there's not enough to keep you interested and at times this album really got on my nerves."
4,"Mike is okay, but Bruce and Terry saved the day!","This Album is no doubt not one of their best albums. However Bruce Johnston's music is ALWAYS refreshing and wonderful. Terry Melcher is an awesome producer. You can thank him and Mike for making such cool hot-rod hits. Even though Brian didn't contribute much(Okay, not at all) It still is a very good album. If you like modern rock and enjoyed ""Still Crusin'"", you will prbably like this. ""Slow Summer Dancin'(One Summer Night) was my favorite on the album. Bruce proved once again he(and Carl too) could make songs as good as Brian's, such as he did on albums like ""20/20"",""Sunflower"",""Surf's Up"",etc...Lahaina Aloha has a nice melody, but still ""Dancin'..."" is still my favorite. Try it you never know.( One more thing: If you didn't like ""Still Crusin'"" DON'T GET THIS!"
1,The Beach Boys hit a new low,"Perhaps this should just be a Mike Love album, since he pretty much put the thing together. The Beach Boys try to cash in on their ""Kokomo"" success with pointless remakes of ""summertime songs"" as well as less-than-interesting new ones. While the average listener might not see what is wrong with this album, the problem is, the Beach Boys are quite capable of making good music; they have several out-of-print albums which contain some of the best music ever, but instead of trying to build from that, they build into a cheap parody of themselves. And with Carl and Dennis gone, Brian doing music on his own, it looks as if ""Summer In Paradise"" is the group's ""swan song"". How sad."
3,Definitely not their worst,"It is safe to say that while this will never be ranked with their best albums (Today!, Summer Days, Pet Sounds, Sunflower), it will never be considered their worst (The Beach Boys '85, Love You, Stars and Stripes). The remakes of Forever and Surfin are at the least pointless. I did have the privelege of seeing them perform on one of the final tours before Carl's passing and trust me, the live versions of Strange Things Happen and the title track were much more satisfying."
4,Summer In Paradise,"Mostly a good album, some things could have been skipped. It is the one Beach Boys album that features Full House cast member John Stamos as a soloist (he also appeared on Kokomo, plus some Jan & Dean albums as well). He first played drums for the group in 1972, after a hand injury prevented Dennis Wilson from playing drums on stage. This recording of Forever was used on a Full House episode. It features a 90's version of Surfing (a song dating back to the Morgan sessions in 1961), a family-friendly take of The Drifter's Under The Boardwalk, plus great classic rock hits such as Hot Fun In The Summertime, Remember Walking In The Sand, and One Summer Night. The rest is Mike Love/Terry Melcher penned tunes."
5,Summer In Paradise,"I've heard all the tracks on this album, though I don't own it. And I won't ever own it at the rates you charge for it. You are out of your blooming minds to charge that for a CD! Last spring, a new CD was about 30 some dollars and now it's up to near 150 dollars. That's ridiculous and I hope nobody pays that for it."
4,"""forever"" from full house","the beach boys are great singer.there's the last song called ""forever"" witch was performed on the tv show full house. by john stamos.be sure to watch full house and if you're lucky on one of the full house episode they show the music video ""FOREVER"" email me if you want more information on: Full house John Stamos or who knows....."
4,Forever,"This is not a Highclass album with the beach boys I think it it a little bit to much Mike Love, but I like the album anyway in a strange way, ""Forever"" wich is one of my all-time fovourite song with the bb is on this album in a great cover...."
1,"Awful, Awful Awful!!!!","You know you're in bad shape when the cover art of an album is actually better than the music, but that's exactly the case here. It's really quite sad to see just how bad a once great group has become. OK, Brian Wilson wasn't involved in this debacle, and it shows. There is NOTHING about this CD that has any redeeming value. The songs are just plain BAD. Horrible melodies, juvenile lyrics and overall unlistenable songs are prevelant throughout...all courtesy of Mike Love, and his cast of idiots. Even the cover songs don't work. This is without a doubt, the WORST CD in my varied and vast collection. The Beach Boys will always be a favorite band of mine, but this CD belongs in only one place...The TRASH can!!"
4,Revisiting the beach,"The highlight of this album--and the reason I bought it--is the last track, ""Forever"". Originally featured--of all places--in a Full House episode, the lyrics are those of a simple, sweet love song. ""If every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever. . ."" Some tracks, such as ""Surfin'"", are rearrangements of classic Beach Boys songs. This album isn't ""Pet Sounds"", but it's still excellent."
1,"Oh, not again.","""The Beach Boys' best album since 'Still Cruisin'"", someone said. It's the Beach Boys' *only* album since 'Still Cruisin'. And strange as it may seem, there was a time when the Beach Boys actually did _new_ things on an album, instead of blurry photocopies of songs from twenty years earlier. Why is ""Sunflower"" out of print and this one still available?"
3,Forever is a remake,"It seems that some reviewers think that the first time Forever appeared was on Full House and sung by John Stamos. It is actually on ""Sunflower"" and sung by Dennis Wilson. It's a great song and the original is a great version.I've never actually heard this CD, just posting to clue some people in on Forever."
3,Not bad at all.,"An enjoyable listen, I actually like this CD just fine, 3 to 4 stars. Nothing ground breaking, just pleasant, Kokomo would fit very well on this CD, the album feels like that song, and has that kind of sound throughout in my opinion."
1,"Somebody put them out of their misery, please!,","When writing the excellent (& a must read for any BB's fan) ""The Complete Guide to the Music of the Beach Boys"" Andrew Doe & John tobler hit the nail on the head with their description of the LP""What would a Beach Boy album sound like, without out any creative input from Brian Wilson? Well here you have it, the absolute nadir of their career, pointless, vapid & Soulless"".They couldn't been more right, who ever were advising the remaining BBs at the time should have been fired on the spot! As they recorded an album without any artistic merit what so ever, & for the longest times was an absolutely sorry full end to their recording career.Thankfully the Band reformed in 2012 to record ""That's why God made the Radio"", not a classic BB's album, but if is their last album, they will finish with their creditability in-tack."
5,A tense testimony to a time of terror...,"This book is very helpful in the effort to understand the psychology behind the Dirty War in Argentina. Horacio Verbitsky is a well known authority on this time, since he was pursued by the government during the war and since. The journalistic bravery he has shown certainly merit recognition. His pointed questions to war criminal Francisco Scilingo highlight this telling work. The insights will turn your stomach and blow your mind. The Flight reinforces the notion that the military in any country must have full civilian oversight. The Flight is a not a gentle reminder of this vital concept."
5,I think this is an exellent book.,I am a teacher and I read many stories from The Pink Fairy Book to my class. They were amazed that there were so many more wonderful fairy tales that they had never seen on cartoons. I recomend this to all teachers and parents to read to treir kids.
3,Not for everyone,"As always, Lang's fairy books are amazing, full of stories that are so interesting because they are the foundation upon which almost all fantasy today rests. These stories, their authenticity painfully researched and maintained, are not only facinating but are slightly different to what we know and love today.This is the reason I've took two stars away from the mark. This is a warning to would be readers. Lang's works are more an academic work and not really a fun to ready collection of stories. In addition, the strangenes of some of these stories and their difference to what we know and love today will make this book unreadable to some readers, probably most of the younger ones.In conclusion, this is an excelent book, just not for everyone. Read the first pages and the first story before you decide to plunge inside. You have been warned ..."
4,This is an exelent book for all ages.,I recomend the Pink Fairy Book to parents teachers and children. It has a lot of lessons and morales an gives children an exelent experience in classical literature.
2,Could have been much better,"Good story and good acting, but audio is quite poor. The familiar theme music is missing entirely and the dialogue is spotty at best. Several sentences were hard to hear, and then the background music would blast you out of your chair. Glad I didn't buy the 5-pack."
4,"Good eps, so-so quality","These are classic ""Bonanza"" episodes. I would prefer that the videos include the original theme music, but I understand that copyright issues prevent that. The technical quality of the video is not the best, but the DVD is quite watchable. I'm happy to see ""Bonanza"" being released in DVD format, and look forward to more eps on DVD!"
3,Compressors: Selection and Sizing,"This is a good general overall reference book for compressors.It could have been much better if the author had provided more ofhis own development for various topics instead of using materialfrom other authors and then merely giving them credit (variousvelocity diagrams).In this day and age of 3-dimensional, multicolored graphic images,I think that the author could have drastically improved his presentationof the material."
2,they make the reader work,"There have been far too many unpleasant surprises for me to recommend this cookbook. Steps often aren't in a logical order, and they don't present considerations in a timely manner--notes often appear too late. It's the type of cookbook in which a complex recipe will call for an ingredient on page 120, and then when you get midway through the recipe on page 120, an obscure note says, oh yeah, by the way, this seventh step takes three days. Or you'll follow a recipe to the letter and find that while you had to rush to make twice the dough called for, you have to throw out a pound of unused pasta. In short, this book was written by amateur writers...and it shows. They place a great burden on the reader to read ahead and figure out what the heck they meant to say."
1,WARNING!!!!!,"Do NOT get taken. This phone was manufactured in Singapore and was NOT made for service in the US. If it breaks, which mine did, Motorola will NOT fix it. You are STUCK!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!THE BLUE RAZOR WAS *NOT* MANUFACTURED FOR USE IN THE US, HENCE, ALL OF THE PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,Jack Spicer review,"This film is ninety-five minutes of fun, good photography and magicical music. It didn't measure up for Leonard Maltin, he rated it two stars out of four. But I thoroughly enjoyed it although it wasn't completely understandable or believable. Who would have ever cast Desi Arnaz as a villianous mayor? He looked kind of like Dick Cheney having a bad trip. Joan Hackett was endearing and delightful as a magician's partner and Ryan O'Neal's son, Griffin O'Neal was excellent as the principal in the story. Terry Garr, who always brings magic to her roles was given only a small part in this film. Raul Julia made his character live as always, and Huntz Hall from the 1930's Bowery Boys was fun as a rich man's flunky. However, having said all of the above, it may not satisfy those who demand movies be tidy, unmuddled and conventional. This movie entertained me."
1,"Film has potential, but fails","I was excited to see this film because it dealt with escape artists. Not true.This movie slow, dull,and never comes to any conclusion.The kid is interesting, but they don't develop his charactor much.The storyline is totally unbelievably and acting so-so. Don't waste your time or money on this grooner!"
3,Okay Watch,"I feel that for the price I paid that this watch should have been a little better. The box was lacking. It didn't have a true hinge, but instead hinged because the top and bottom were stuck together with a sticky paper at the back. Also, I gave this to a Mason, whom prides himself on workmanship and ethics. I don't think I would buy this for a Mason again because I feel the quality of a product for someone who prides themselves on these things and gives so much back to the community should be getting more. I think the price was reasonable, but not for the quality of the product. I paid $20. I worry about the longevity of the product."
1,"Hard to like, easy to put down.","While I understood all the issues in this book, the guilt shame ect.. I really didn't enjoy it at all, The characters were not developed enough, Michael was weak, even pathetic and Hanna was not a likeable person. I would have liked it if I could get into the characters more, it was hard to enjoy when I had such feelings of indifference towards them."
2,Disappointing and Frustrating,"Oddly engaging, yet wholly unbelievable. The first-person narrator is charmless and preachy, and the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the teenage boy and the older woman (not to mention the relationship itself) is completely ludicrous and poorly motivated. I like the idea of a novel dealing with later-generation Nazi guilt from the German citizen perspective, but the issue is so weighed down with theoretics, rather than true feelings or thoughts, that it comes across dry and essayist, instead of compelling fiction as truth. A different author with this material may have hit gold, but Schlink fails to ignite much of anything here, and the result is disappointing and a bit frustrating."
2,Very Disappointing!,"I am an English teacher and read constantly. In the past I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Oprah's selections. I was excited to see that this novel addressed the Holocaust. Wrong! The first 30 pages of text dwell only on a licentious relationship between a woman and a boy half her age. There is little character development of either character, so I found myself caring about neither. The ending, while slightly shocking, is very contrived and contains no closure. I could not put this book down; not because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, but to get it over with so I could move on to something more enjoyable. A grave disappointment."
3,I can feel siltent beauty of two lovers.,"I first tried the movie, and then the book. Both seemed beautiful. Even though Hanna's images changes as she gets old and that made Kid (I've already forgot his name. I remember Hanna.) shocked, Kid stays close to Hanna, and the movement of his heart shows how sensitive he is."
3,Morally challenging,"I didn't care much for the first part of the story, which concentrated on the affair between the boy and a woman much older than him. The part that made the deepest impression which I thought is also a challenge thrown to us, the readers is Michael's moral dilema on whether to save Hanna and deny her the dignity which she obviously cares so much about or to respect her wish and keep what she feels is so shameful, a secret. At the end of the book, Hanna is no longer ashamed of that inability anymore, but is in fact proud that she has overcome it. Does it make a difference to Michael, I wonder? The book did mention that he is proud of Hanna, but did the fact also made him more remorse and guilty?"
4,Intelligently written.,"Schlink casts out a line to the readers, using an intriguing thought provoking theme as bait. Once you've begun reading, it becomes almost impossible to stop. The story will move you into a mode of thinking unfamiliar in most American novels. Intelligently written, it challenges your morals, yet invites a particularly wonderful sense of commonality with life, love, and forgiveness."
2,I don't get it?!,"I expected it to be riveting, but it wasn't, although I managed to finish it easily enough. (probably because it was realtively short)I still don't understand why she had an affair with a 15 year old boy. Nor why he never got over it. The book didn't educate me at all about the Holocaust like I hoped it would. I don't know why he wouldn't visit her in prison or why she killed herself. Seems to have a lot of missing links. Maybe I didn't care enough about the characters to think about these situations. This was is a take it or leave it kind of book."
3,What ? Who ? When ?,i cant figure out whats so great about this book. i read the triumph and the glory because it was mentioned favorably by a lot of people and it was great. but the reader left me bewildered at its lack of direction. what was the point of the theme? i'm going to read back through the reviews and see what more is said and maybe try reading it again. i just got to be missing something somewhere . . .
3,Interesting and fast read,"This book delves deep into human psychology, lust, love and truth. The character development is often weak but its message packs a strong punch."
2,Interesting but still misses the mark,"This book was interesting but I just did not feel it was really worth my time. Not that my time is better than anyone else's but i just do not have a lot of it. My main complaint with this book is that it just seems so unrealistic. Dont get me wrong I know that it is horrible not to be able to read. I sure your self esteem would be rock bottom. However, I just can not imagine anyone going to prison for almost twenty years just because they would not admit they could not read. I also can not imagine letting someone I knew was innocent and someone I loved or at least loved beyond comparison at one time , go to prison. This book read like a soap opera. By the way just because Opera recommends does not make it worthy, Although I think very highly of Opera."
1,Extremely boring and difficult to get through,"I usually find the Oprah books very interesting, but not this one. This was one of the most boring books I have read. I skimmed through it just so I could find out what happened to Hannah and Michael. I did not like the fact that Hannah referred to Michael as ""kid"". If the author did not specify Michael's name, we would have never known it until very late in the book. I don't give this a good rating at all."
1,This book S**KS!,"This was horrible. It was dry, boring, and EXTREMELY hard to get through. The plot (what little there was of it) wandered, and at times was completely pointless. It was HORRIBLE, I am so mad I spent the money on it. I have always enjoyed Oprah's book but next time she should just stick to books originally written in English- there was a serious culture gap here."
2,Medicore writing,"I think the topic could be interesting, but I agree with many who said that the characters were just too sketchy. I didn't have much of a feel for either of them."
3,"This book was definitely an easy read, but somewhat boring!","This book was educational in raising issues about the Holocaust. Other than that, it was boring."
2,It draws you in but leaves you hanging,"The book draws you in with Michael and Hanna's relationship at the beginning, and character development would naturally seem to follow - but it doesn't. Michael has more passion and evokes more interest from the reader at 15 than at any other point in the book. I wish more could have been written about the reasons for Michael's failed relationships and his generations' attitudes towards the horrors of the holocaust. The book just was not very good. I expected much more from an Oprah book club book. Don't waste your time."
3,A Smooth Translation,"Bernard Schlink & Carol Janeway give us a smooth, poingnant, German translated book of love, eroticism and shocking hideous crime.In ""The Reader"", I found myself easily drawn into Michael and Hanna's passionate world. We follow their lives from their 1st meeting when Michael is 15 & Hanna is 25. And onto when Michael is a young law student and Hanna is on trial for an unspeakable crime.As in most ""Oprah's Picks""....this is a book of hope in it's truist form. A daunting novel for all.if you find my comments interesting, please click the ""yes""--thanks--CDS"
3,"The Reader - short and fluid, but predictable","Because of all the hype I heard, I was expecting something much greater than what I read. The story was predictable, and the writing was obviously a translation. There are better books out there to read if you only have limited time."
2,Not very entertaining,"At first the book was good, but it grew tiresome. I found myself skipping pages at a time. You really didn't get to know the characters. I didn't connect with the main character at all. His affair with the older woman was interesting at first, but it was no great love story. If you're looking for a quick read, but no feelings this is for you."
2,I wanted to like this book.,"I wanted to like this novel, but it was just ok. It was very superficial and dialogue driven. The perceptions were lots of words strung together to similate emotion, but it was false emotion. I didn't care for either character, Hanna or Michael, which is a mistake for this kind of novel. The main character is a statuatory rapist, for goodness sake. The later recollections are wordy and tortuous attempts at feeling that don't work, the twist, was not a twist at all (I figured it out earlier than the author wanted me to) and the ending was merciful."
3,Kinda weird...,"This book was ok, but left me thinking it was kind of gross and weird. The ending was a nice little twist, and it was a quick easy read, but not the greatest thing I've picked up. I didn't really like or connect with the main characters and couldn't understand the appeal of the relationship between the two. If you have nothing better read, go for it, otherwise pass on it."
4,"Excellent, moving novel","I really enjoyed this novel-- very compelling. Ironically, its style owes alot to Knut Hamsun's ""Victoria'; while Hamsun won the Nobel prize, he was later exposed as a nazi sympathizer. The book really gives some insight into what recent historians have described as the 'blandness' of the nazies and nazi sympathizers, and to a certain extent, germans in general during the war."
2,This book is not worth buying.,"I saw this book on Oprah's show and decided to buy it because of Oprah's glowing remarks. I do not recommend this book for many reasons. The primary reason is that the character development is weak. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, whether it be hatred or love. The plot was not very interesting either, and although I did finish it within several hours, it was not a page turner. Obviously, being a page-turner is not a primary reason to read a book. However, it offered very little literary value, and it was not a book that challenged your mind. The only reason that I continued to read it was because I had hoped that it would get better. It didn't. You will be very sorry that you wasted your time with this book."
3,Interesting story,"I thought this was an interesting story, but after reading the book just consider it an average read. It's not long and easy to read...two of its best features."
2,Did I read the same book?,"Even more surprising than how boring this book was is the fact that some people actually loved it. It had absolutely no depth or insight as to motivation, character, or more importantly, the gravity of the holocaust. I'll never forget the glorious moment I finished it. Keep to talk shows, Oprah."
2,Lame,"I was really dissapointed with this book. I thought the language dragged the plot out endlessly and I couldn't stop putting it down. I took me mush longer to read this than ""I know this much is true"" and it was so much longer. I didn't enjoy this book at all."
4,"Strong, thought provoking, and unique.","So many issues come to light in this book, yet it is written in an understated, almost simple manner. The questions of how a generation of young Germans must deal with the Holocaust, and the specific contradictions in Michael Berg's situation because of his involvement with Hanna are presented in a way that invokes the reader's sensibilities. The book is not perfect, however, as there are some flaws, especially with the question of what was Michael actually doing during WWII, how it effected his life, etc. To not have dealt with this left me feeling a bit jiped, but the overall idea of the book and its resolution (or perhaps lack of one) made it a very compelling and worthwhile read."
2,"Disappointing, I expected more....","I was hoping this book would provide me with something much more. As a person born in post war Germany with parents who were teenagers during the war, with grandparents who experienced their realities I thought this book could have given more. I found the inner struggle that the protaganist expresses superficial and empty. I kept thinking maybe the book lost something in the translation. I gave the book to my parents to read and they felt the same way. Fortunately it was quick to read but at the end I felt nothing. I was hoping for more."
2,"He tried, but he didn't quite succeed...","I read this book as part of a short class on the second generation of people after the Holocaust. It was thought provoking, but, in many ways, flat. The narrator is, as my professor said, ""a collection of ideas,"" and never evolves into a real person. Some of this is intentional on the author's part, however, it becomes inconsistant with what he is able to determine about Hanna (he doesn't have that much insight!). Hanna is the most well drawn character in the book, and, despite her past, has some integrity (she admits to her what she has done and denies what she has not). Her illiteracty explains how SHE became involved to the extent she did, but is by no means an explanation for all participants. It made me think about what I would have done in her postion, and the most real part of the book is when Hanna turns to the judge and says, ""...what would you have done?""--and truly wants an answer."
4,I didn't think I would be writing this...,"It was not until page 188 (of 218) that this book clicked with me. Until that moment, ""The Reader"" was a quick read with little depth or reader engagement. Mediocre, at best. In a landslide, however, the story grabbed at my heart and tested my reasoning. The climax of this story makes it a worthwhile read.The final thirty pages depict a narrator torn by his past and present, and trying to reason his relationship with a Nazi SS Guard. Beyond the themes of anti-semitism, hate, and prejudice, the narrator grapples with the forces of human nature. His troubles are those that you and I will endure in our own lifetimes. This story and its particular outcome begin to place our own circumstances and stories in perspective.If for no other reason that seeing how you react to the climax of the story, I highly recommend ""The Reader."" It begins as a shallow harlot's tale, but eventually wraps itself around your psyche."
2,Story Divided,"The beginning was beautifully written and sensitive. After Hanna leaves, the story goes down such a different path that is so disconnected from the beginning which I call the first story. While I appreciate the message that the second part of the book was sending, it was like reading a book written in two parts by two unequally talented authors."
2,Why all the hype??,"I absolutely could not wait to read this book. As it turns out, I could have waited all my life and not missed much. The Reader's premise is a very intriguing story line with so much potential. Unfortunately, the outcome is a disappointing and depressing book that leaves much to be desired. The story develops in a very uneasy way. I felt like this story wanted to almost stop itself from being told. With all of the wonderful books out there I am a little dissapointed that I spent my time on this one."
3,An Adequate Reading Experience,A plethora of thoughful insights hung on an improbable plot line written beautifully.
4,A Good Read,The first time I picked up The Reader I was astonished at it's boldness. I was not prepared for the oncoming adult content but nevertheless I enjoyed it. The Reader held my attention throughout the entire novel. I did not run into any slow points nor did I run into any really confusing areas. I enjoyed the level of difficulty in the writing but it was never too hard to follow. I think the sexual anecdotes also kept my attention. I would recommend The Reader for anyone interested in a quick novel with a lot of insight.
3,"Strange Book, Interesting Take on Nazi-era Crimes","The reader in my opinion was a very strange book about a boy's obsession with an older woman. I can see the irony in the woman later turning out to be a former SS officer, but I don't see why the author had to put so much sexually explicit material in a book about crimes committed in the past. Other then that I found the authors side quest to understand the holocaust to be quite worthy of note."
4,Wow,"This book kept you turning the pages. I read A LOT, but I must say this book took me by surprise. And the best part....when I picked up this book to read it, I had no idea it was being made into a motion picture. I loved this book. I did not care to much for the way some of it was written, but who am I to judge? :) All in all, this book was excellent."
3,A worthwhile read,"This book is more about relationship and the perculiarities of the human mind than it is about the Holocaust or Jews. Schlink's observations about behavior and your emotions when passion is involved are often deadly accurate. The plot is rather unique, and his descriptions and observations of the events leave no doubt that at least portions of this story really occurred. The author's prose is clear and concise, no wasted words or excessive imagery, which on occasion wouldn't have been a bad thing. Hanna is a peculiar character, sometimes sad, at other times frustrating and impossible to figure out. Having been on the same end of a May-December romance, I can relate to much of Schlink's confusions and desires as he speaks of Hanna. He raises some questions and issues to which he gives no answer, but all things considered, a fine novel. One thing I very much liked is that the events and outcomes were generally logical and the turning of events believable."
1,Flat and depressing--Oprah what were you thinkin?!!,"Although I found the premise intriguing, the main character and narrator had the appeal of a wet sweater on a hot day. He lived his life without conviction or passion and whined about it. The woman might have had more life, but through his eyes was flat and unsympathetic. All in all the book was depressing without containing any redeeming insights into human nature. Somebody should give Oprah some upbeat, multidimensional books to read for a change. Or if she insists on depressing books, how about ""Grapes of Wrath""?"
3,disturbing,"This is a very disturbing book. I am uncomfortable with a 36-year-old woman seducing a 15-year-old boy, and not being charged with some crime. I don't like the tone of their relationship, it wasn't loving, and it was more a case of Hanna controlling Michael. The way it tried to excuse, or at the very least minimize Hanna's guilt. You have a pedophile that was also a cold-blooded Nazi war criminal. That's not a love story. It's very disturbing just how many readers thought it was a 'wonderful' love story and seemed unmoved by her manipulation of a teenage boy. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific times in world history. Germany has to live with what they did. I think this is a case of trying to deal with the guilt that the German people still carry."
4,So you figured out the secret???,"I was captivated from the start. The reference to the Post War German guilt and the secret of Hanna which I expect most readers to figure out early in the novel, did not detract from the beautiful interaction between the characters. The love cementing them for the rest of their lives unbiased by age, or time. Perhaps an additional lesson may be learnt, Don't hold on to the past, the enjoyment of the present may pass you by."
2,Flat,"I think something was lost in translation. There's an excellent story buried between two covers, it's simply one-dimensional, lacking humanity, feeling, hollow? I really don't know what was wrong with it. I do know I felt like a doctor was describing the symptoms of the characters. A bit sterile for me."
2,did i read the same book?,I was very disappointed in this book. I felt no real connection to the characters. I kept thinking that something got lost in translation when they made the book into English language. Perhaps the film will be much better at showing this story. I cannot recommend this read.
1,I didn't like it......at all,At first I thought it's going to be a good story but I really got tired of it after a while. I wonder why this book is on the top of the best-seller chart. I really thought it was a waste of my time.
1,"Horrible, horrible book","The Reader was a horrible book. It was just this side of pornographic, and kept going on and on about their sexual encounters. Hanna was an interesting character though I thought she was quite undeveloped in character. I'm surprised at Oprah's selection this time. A lot of her other recommendations have been very good. I hope she does better next time."
4,Tantalizing novel,"I agree with all the praise lavished on this novel. I, too, cannot stop thinking about it. It haunts, it probes, it wounds its readers. There is no recovery, no easy redemption from the questions this novel asks. It is Kafka's ax to the frozen sea within us. Still and all, it feels disturbingly incomplete. As other readers have already asked, why doesn't he visit her in prison? Why can't he break through his own cold impersonality? He doesn't even seem to make the effort, as if it isn't worthwhile. My other, and most important question, is why did Hannah did what she did in the camp and in the burning church? What are her motives? What's in her soul?A foot-note: I am glad I read the book before I read the reviews because so many of them are spoilers. Why do reviewers feel compelled to summarize the plot? There is no need, really.S. Spilka"
4,a sad story of two wasted lives...,"'The Reader' is about a teenager who falls in love, and has a sexual relationship with an older woman. After the affair he discovers that in a prior life she worked for The Third Reich and was involved with something bad, very bad. In the end the past comes back to haunt the woman, and the teenager is haunted by memories of the woman through his adulthood. No happy endings here.Although the story is rather simple, it is written as a memoir by the young man, I think the author makes it work by the genuine emotion projected by the two main characters. The two characters aren't very likable but I was very empathetic to their plight. Yet at times I felt the author didn't dive into details as well as he should have; it was if I was reading the Reader's Digest version of a fuller novel.Bottom line: a depressingly realistic story of doomed lives. Recommended."
4,better than the movie,"So, I had heard from a friend that she hated this movie and complained about how she could feel no compassion for the characters while watching the movie. I am pleased to say that the book is an entirely different experience. It is well written and the inner struggle to deal with the issues is palpable, but I can see why that would not translate to the screen. A quick, excellent read!"
3,"Elegant spare writing,eqivicable character development","I liked the clean/spare writing style, the briefness of the book particularly juxtaposed with the moral dilemmas Schlink is trying to address- they could clearly fill tomes.Ultimately it is too spare. Who is Hannah? An abused child? A sadist? A woman of limited intelligence? A borderline personality? I never understood her choices.Any real insight into them was lost for me."
2,What is Oprah thinking lately?,"I do not regularly get Oprah book club books - not to sound snotty, but what appeals to the masses in the literary sense does not usually speak to me. However, encouraged by my enuthusiasm for Wally Lamb and Jane Hamilton, I read on. Ugh. First the Pilot's Wife (atrocious) and then this? Oprah, come on. Character driven books with no plot I can deal with. Plot driven books with no character are harder to deal with but still carry SOME redeeming value. Books which meander and look deep within them for some sort of introspection which does not exist and then ultimately do not lead you anywhere (and don't even throw you the bone of having brilliant, delicate or delicious passages to revel in) is out of the question. Certainly not as contrived as the Pilot's Wife - and since it only takes about 2 hours to read, not as big a waste of time - but certainly not worthy of effusive praise, either."
4,Almost perfect but not quite,"The Reader is truly a book for everyone. Fans of stories like The Triumph and the Glory or The Testament will like this book. People who liked The Poisonwood Bible or Memoirs of a Geisha will like this book. People who liked Stones From the River or The Pilot's Wife will like this book. Readers who enjoy the Oprah books will LOVE this book. It has everything one could ask for. A vast range and scope of human emotion and experience is encapsulated into The Reader, in a very eloquent manner. Don't miss this one, it is unforgettable."
4,Interesting perspective . An unusual love story,"I found this to be a quick read. It was not a book I would have chosen, had I not just joined a book club that was reading it. I enjoyed the questions it raised. But, felt too many thoughts were left unanswered. I'm very glad that I read it."
4,Thought Provoking,"I had this book in my shelf for years. Only when I realized it had been made into a movie, did I pull it off to read it. I wanted to have the full details before seeing the film. At any rate, it was a good book. It's short, well-written, and I think, brings up a lot of food for thought. One of my favorite quotes is: The Truth of What One Says, Lies in What One Does.It was actually a sad tale that brought up questions about whether we really know a person. And if we fall in love and discover that the person is not whom we thought, do we continue to love them, or can the horror (if that's the case) of what they've done, erase what one feels?I think the book is good and worth a read. It won't take up too much of your time."
3,Not a page turner,"I liked the book. I would not say it is a page turner, where you can't wait to see what happens on the next page. Throughout the book I felt that the weather was grey and dismal--which can be pretty depressing after a while. I also found the story to be somewhat predictable after a while. This is not a book that you can't put down and then go back to. The book doesn't seem to have its own momentum. Interesting but not riviting."
3,Can pass it by,"While the book has some very eloquent language and few memorable scenes, I felt everything in between was particularly mediocre. The story is a little demented with a 15 year old boy in a sexual relationship with a 30-something woman, but soon you forget the age difference and are caught up with the passion and unlikelyhood of their sordid romance. I have yet to meet a 15 year old who behaves like our hero, Michael. Parts of the story were too absorbed in legal issues and Hanna's trial and I felt myself drifting in and out. It never really captured my full interest. The book is jumps around without any explanation of how we arrived at the next stop and I felt I never got an actual feel for any of the characters. I was disturbed by the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion and felt the emphasis (and better writing) was wasted on the affair between Hanna and Michael. If you're searching for something to read, give this a try, but only after you've exhausted other sources."
2,Wasted Story Line,"What potential this book could have had! Here is a young man walks into a courtroom and finds his lover of years past accused of crimes during WWII. One would think this book would be gripping. But it is not. The characters were shallow and simplistic. The writing was dry. Ultimately, in spite of the promising story, The Reader is disappointing."
2,Don't waste time and mone on this one.,"When Oprah anounced this book as a book club choice, I bought it the very next day. A few hours later I was holding the closed book in my hand trying to decide what I had just read. I was blown away. The book did not touch me as much as it revolted me. I wanted to know why? I felt that nothing was ever resolved. It was an absolute pointless read. I have gained more insight reading a trashy Daniell Steele novel. You can bet I will be more causious next time I choose a book off of the book club list."
4,'Excellent - I read it in one sitting!',"One of the best books I've read in a long time! The story keeps moving and keeps you anticipating the characters actions and reactions. The story from past to present keeps you wanting more and more. If the book was twice as long, I would have stayed interested and wanted more. A novel that takes on the aura of a true and riveting life story. A believable real life drama! You won't be sorry with this one!"
3,Disappointing,I heard a lot of hype about this book but found it to be very insubstantial. It was hard to follow and even though you get lots of details you never really get to know the main characters.
3,Overall not good enough,"The Reader makes a good start by arousing the reader's interest to read on. However, it doesn't satisfy my appetite for a good work which must include a strong recognition and climax. The protagonist's recognition of Hanna's secret as being an illiterate does not product a great impact on the reader as well as on the book itself. Besides, the work seems to leave many questions unsolved. Maybe the worst part is that we as the readers fall into the protagonist's subjective world without ever coming up to see what's really goimg on. If there's an access to Hanna's world, that will be better. The world of literature is never the same as the real life. To some extent, reading the book makes me feel like seeing someone's true life story instead of a well-written, solid novel. Overall the Reader is not good enough to the reader."
2,Only if you've never read a book on this subject ...,"Actually, I'm not sure if I think this book deserves even two stars; it's not terrible, but it's pretty weak. Why are there so many questions the book leaves unanswered? I keep on coming back to the possibility that the author, while starting with an interesting idea, couldn't execute it very well. The translation was totally banal, and it may be that the original was banal, too. I had no sympathy for either of the main characters, both of whom lacked any depth. I got tired of the author's philosophically superficial musings; the whole thing started to come across like a term paper. If you want to read a great, well-written story that deals with the German character and complexities of WWII, pick up ""Stones from the River"" by Ursula Hegge. That's a five-star book!"
4,Very thought provoking - leaves you wanting to read it again,"The Reader asks the questions that post war Germans ask themselves about their nation's dark history and the personal involvement of those close to them in the Holocaust. After the horrors of the Holocaust became known throughout the world - it seems impossible that such a horrific crime could ever happen again. However, the individuals that committed these crimes are grandparents, parents, neighbors, professional associates of present day Germans - it is difficult for them to believe that people with whom they have personal relationships have either committed the crimes or associated themselves with the perpetrators. This book will leave you thinking."
2,Somewhat dissapointing,"I am surprised by Oprah's choice of books. I found this book to drag on forever. It was very vague with some interesting areas and went into way too much detail about nothing. Hanna's side of the story was never discussed much and left you feeling depraved of half of the story line. The one chapter at the end is the only one that lets you get to know her. I might have had more compassion for her if I had ""known"" her better. Definately not one of the better books I have read."
4,Hard to explain,"This book is hard to explain because of the many different emotions that it leaves you with. I don't really know how I feel about this book. It was a good read and definitely raised many questions in my mind, but left me unsettled."
2,"The Reader, not what I anticipated","when I read, or more correctly tried to read, the Reader, I wasn't taken by it very much. I was surprised by that, as I had previously read Black and Blue, and Jewel, and just got done with Where The heart is, and I couldn't put those down. I guess I didn't much care for the sex in almost every page, for such a short book, and I am not really too interested in WW2. This one, for some reason just did not send me."
3,It was OKAY,"It was okay. Not great, not awful, just okay. Good story overall and it did offer a lot to think about, but it moved slowly and even dragged at times. Predictable."
3,Lost in Translation,"Though I enjoyed the book, I do sense that the writing got flattened out during the translation process. It felt dull, hollow, as if some intermediary was paraphrasing what the author had originally written. Just my feeling. Though I did like it in spite of this."
4,Love in Troubled Times,This is a good book about a boy who falls in love with an older women only to find out she has a very troubled past that is coming back to haunt her. He never forgets her and can't understand what is going on until he grows up and finds out exactly what is going on. Tried to avoid spoiling anything in my review. Try it out I think many will enjoy this book.
1,Schlink disappoints his Reader,"I did not care for this book in the least. First off, I felt that it read at a High School level and was in no way interesting to the adult reader. Schlink begins The Reader in mid-story. We have no background or character development. One day Michael Berg, the main character, is sick in bed and the next he is having sex with a woman twice his age. Then we turn the page and she is a Nazi war criminal. As Schlink takes us down this some what interesring story line he still forgets to develop the characters. Why should we care what happens to Hanna? Schlink did not reach me on a moral or philosophical level, he could not even reach me on an erotic level. All in all, this Reader was a let down and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I thought I would pick the book up to read because so many people are recommending it and the subject matter seemed interesting. Unfortunately, I found the book to be emotionally detached and hard to relate. The main character is hard for me to sympathize with. While the woman is a tragic figure, I wish I could read more about what is driving her silence."
1,Mediocre is an understatement,"I found this book disturbing as it abdicates personal responsibility for the evil things that people do. The author has written this book to dupe the unsuspecting reader. His distant style and debauched view of the world, leave a bitter taste in the mouth. We are not all that prison guard as he would have us believe."
4,"Germans, sadness, love, sex","You can read this book very quickly. It took me an hour. The sex turns to nothing, the love evaporates, and still you keep reading until you can't figure out what you would do if. You feel the narrator's young pain. Sitting in the courthouse encountering the former Nazi who was his lover, you wonder what you would have done. Shame, love, grief, consume narrator and reader."
2,I think hopeful is the most positive thing you could say.,"Even though this book is written in a very simplistic style, it took me two weeks to get through the book because I did not enjoy it. Character development was poor, you can finish the book and not know much about any of the characters, their motivations or goals. The plot was shallow and unbelievable. This book did not effectively convey any message, or story. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends"
1,An excellent WASTE of time & money.,"I picked this book up because it was a ""best-seller."" I felt compelled to finish it knowing that I had paid for it... but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. How could I waste my time on top of wasting my money?I'm surprised that so many people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars actually got through it... Where was the substance? The relationship between Michael & Hanna was appalling and twisted. And what about Michael's parents, didn't they notice he was gone for hours?What about the Holocaust? German Society at the time?Unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, I wouldn't bother picking this one up."
1,Waste of time.,"I saw the book at half-price, bought it, read it, all the while wishing I hadn't and when I finished it, I donated it to the local library as I did not want it in my book collection. I did not like the characters, the setting, the subject matter or the underlying theme of literacy. Why Oprah chose this book, I'll never know."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book on a 16 hour flight to Thailand. I finished quickly, and what a waste it was. This book was boring as could be. There was only a few parts that were captivating. Save your money!"
1,Had so much potential,"I was so disappointed in this book. For a short novel, it ran too long with unnecessary details. I felt nothing with any of the characters. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,"Interesting stiory, beautifully written","This is the first book I have read from B. Schlink but I was impressed by the story and the writing style. In several pasages, the book read with the flow of good poetry. Whether to credit the author or translator, I'm not sure. Although the ending was rather sad, the book was a fast, satisfying read."
3,Who Is Guilty?,"I have read just the most helpful favorable and critical reviews. There are just too many to read, 800+ at this time.I got furious with this book. I am Jewish, I am surely not a holocaust denier, but the narrator Michael Berg bent me out of shape with HIS guilt. Of course Hanna bore real guilt, but neither of these two reviewers suggested that Berg/Hamlet is as guilty of a capital crime as she is. He thinks about talking but ends up doing nothing, costing Hanna years in prison and perhaps her life. I am not sympathetic toward Hanna, I just would have liked to see some condemnation of the narrator.Who is The Reader? It is not Hanna, it is Michael; and it is me and you and how we react to the book's reader's crime of silence."
1,"I did not like this book. Boring, predictable.",How arrogant that her shame in being unable to read and write would be the premise of such a pitifull life. It is really almost sick and I too and surprised at Oprah - I have enjoyed almost all of her previous picks.
1,Bogus and Meretricious,"The voice of this book, even in translation, is so compelling that it can almost blind you to the fact that the book, despite the kudos, is psychologically bogus to a repellent degree. Quite simply, despite all the window dressing about the joys of literature and reading, it posits that a guard at Auschwitz didn't know about the Holocaust and that she was more ashamed of being illiterate than of being a murderer. Having studied the Holocaust for over thirty years, taught Holocaust film and literature, written about the effects of the Holocaust on the ""Second Generation,"" most recently in a memoirMy Germany: A Jewish Writer Returns to the World His Parents Escaped, and even co-authored books about shame itself, I found this central conceit of the book unbelievable. Unfortunately, it seduced even Oprah, but then she has a history of being taken in by fakes."
2,Better enjoyed in the past...,"I did not enjoy reading this novel. I would not have even picked up this book except for the fact that I am involved in a book club and this is what we were reading that week. Only a couple of us from the book club, enjoyed The Reader. The rest of us despised the character Hanna and felt that Michael was a very confused and simplistic character. The novel didn't seem to have purpose. I will admit though, that I am only a teenager and I think I will enjoy The Reader much more if I read it again in about fifteen to twenty years. I didn't enjoy reading this book, but I definitely understood it a lot better after I had finished reading it and I was looking back on the novel. If you are reading this book, you should finish it and then think back on what happened in it and what this novel was truly about. The Reader is more appealing in the past than in the present."
2,Did we lose something in the translation?,"I am puzzled by this book. The characters are cold and unyielding. The prose is spare and lucid, though many parts read like the narrator's soul-less observation or statement of facts without revealing or even hinting at his pain and troubles. What is about the war and Hannah in his childhood that made him the unfeeling and unloved adult? The Holocaust forms the background for much of the novel and Schlink does suggest the hidden psychological impact of the atrocities but if his intention is to tickle without eliciting any giggles then he has succeeded."
1,"horrible book, avoid it","did you expect a book oprah told you to read to be good? probably not... here is another case of a book picked by her that is very _bad_. would have given it a zero rating, but there is no option to do so."
3,"Haunting, probing -- yet lacking.","Despite its acclaim and recent hype, ""The Reader"" fails to probe as deeply into one's moral and ethical consciousness as might be hoped or expected. The plot indeed drives home a moral question (broadly, 'what is the extent of forgiveness?'), yet its development and maturation prevent it from truly striking a resonant chord. There is simply too much that is shadowed over, too much that is not discussed, and too much that seems improbable and even impossible in the relationships that are described. Yet the tone and character of the writing earn ""The Reader"" high marks: its masterful use of allusion, its ability to speak volumes by what is left unsaid -- are beautiful things to see in a modern novel. This is a book worth reading, yet perhaps with slightly lower expectations in hand that what the media hype have deemed fashionable."
2,Another average love story,"For me, The Reader was just another average love story that I read for class. Man falls in love, loses love, finds ex-lover again and falls in love again. The story, in my opinion, followed too much of a pre-set standard that has been seen in literature for years. There were a few good plot twists, and a good use of scenery, but overall I was disappointed. Another part of the novel that disappointed me was the lack of flow. The plot jumped around a lot, skipping what I felt were crucial years in the development of the protagonist. I was often baffled by the thoughts of the protagonist, and I felt that I got less out of the book because I could not see where he was coming from. The book also had a moral of sorts, and I hate morals."
4,reading is FUNdamental,"When reading The Reader, the person reading the book is drawn into the story through the excessive use of sex, intrigue and sickness. How the author uses the vast age difference between the main charater and his ""lover"" in addition to the mode in which the two meet, leaves the audience mystified. after the intial shock, the pages begin to calm down, and things, like the main charater, micheal, grow distant yet closer still to his surroundings. As Micheal grows older and more mature, the audience, too, grows. In all, this is a very fast and easy read, any person mature and/or willing to see from a new perspective will greatly enjoy this book. The history used as a backdrop in the main plot will offer other books to be explored. Or, it will trigger the audience to discover more about the underlying subject. So, in a nut shell, I believe that I would recommend this book to all of my friends and associates to read for enjoyment."
4,Quick and easy read.,"I found Schlink's book fun and easy to read. The beginning was a good attention grabber with the sex scenes and the it ended with some thoughtful insights on life. Michael, the main character, becomes fixed on a much older woman when he is young and can not seem to shake her for the rest of his life until she dies. The middle of the book was kind of boring, but necessary for the end, which I thought was well done."
4,the reader,i found the female character unredeming in the book . in the movie they softened her up a great deal
2,Going nowhere,"This book's concept is good, BUT the story does not develop. The characters are not developed and the more importantly the story does not develop well. You don't care about Hanna because you really don't know who she is. I couldn't understand why the narrator so tirelessly obsesses over this girl when we the reader has not had an opportunity to sympathesize for either of them."
2,"Struggled through it, but it did have one interesting moment","Boy, the first part was bad. All about this teenage boy'ssexual awakening in the most clichéd terms. But in the 2nd part of thebook, when Hannah is being tried for Nazi war crimes, she explains that they were all under Hitler's orders and they themselves would have been killed if the orders weren't carried out. Then she turns to the judge and asks the crucial question of the book, ""What would you have done?"" And he has no answer for her. I think the people who said this book was about how terrible the Holocaust was, or how hard it is to love someone who has done something terrible, or how a boy's first love is never forgotten, all missed the point."
3,The reader,"Interesting read, well written although lost momentum 3/4 way in, then picked up. Haven't seen the movie and think it must have been compelling. Take the time and read it!"
3,"Good, but not that good.","Full of questions, wonderments, and themes, The Reader overloads you with morals and overwritten questions. A book with few errors, but also with little to excite who is reading the book."
2,Deceptive,"When I first picked up this book, I thought it would be an engaging story about a woman with a dark secret and a boy struggling to find his sexual identity. Was I wrong! This book is deceptive, in that it promises an engaging story but does not deliver. I was glad that I borrowed the audio tapes, becasue Campbell Scott's great voice kept me listening. I am not sure that I would have finished the novel otherwise. Oprah, please pick some more uplifing novels next year! I understand your choices of books that are supposed to make you think, but not put you to sleep."
3,Interesting Read,Easily understandable but lacked emotional depth almost as if the author only allowed himself to feel a certain amount of anguish and angst in his recant.
3,Definately Worth Reading,"A very strange story of a very unlikely couple. I liked Hanna for about 30 seconds when she helped the very young Michael up onto his feet after he had fallen ill. But I felt that here was a very DARK woman even before I knew her past. She was tragic as were her deeds. I just could not understand Michael's passion for this woman. The book was well written, well developed characters, but a very sad story for both of these two people."
4,The main theme is highly thought provoking.,"I loved the book. Reading this book makes one take a serious look into their heart.A rape is committed, yet this book is not about sex, love or rejection. It deals with highly charged emotional and practical issues which is often difficult to understand or analize."
1,Repetitive and monotonous,"I am a senior in high school and an avid reader. The first half of this book was enjoyable, but then it just got plain boring. Maybe it is my age or lack of interest, but I just ended up skimming the end because I wasn't about to give the time to finish it."
2,A disappointment,"When I first picked this book up, I thought this would be a real thought-provoking novel about the Holocaust. I was very disappointed and could not wait until I finished it so I move on to something more enjoyable. I thought the book lacked character development. What was worse, was the ending which left me feeling very unsettled. Even if I enjoyed this novel and wanted to recommend it, I would be too embarrased because of the sleazy relationship between the woman and the boy half her age."
2,zzzzzzzz,"I found myself skimming through much of ""The Reader"" just to finish the book.It was wrong of Hanna to take advantage of a young Michael. That whole scene disgusted me.The trial was dragged out and boring.I didn't feel for any of the characters in this book."
1,Disappointing.,I found the concept superficial. Small book but didn't hold my interest even for that short amount of time. No depth to the story.
1,Very disappointed,I read this book because of the attention that it received from Oprah. I cannot believe how much they went on about this book. I found it very boring and lost my interest right from the beginning. Because of what I heard on Oprah I kept reading hoping it would get better but it did not.
1,Wasted money,"I bought this book, hoping for a good read, but I definitely did not get that. It did not keep my attention; I didn't feel connected with the characters; I feel like I wasted my money on this one. The author assumes that the reader knows all about the Holocaust, making it difficult to understand to the person, like me, who was never taught the Holocaust in school. I very rarely come across a book that I feel so negatively about, but this is certainly one of them."
1,"Boring, easy to guess the ""secret"", don't bother",It was boring. It was easy to guess the secret. It wasn't gripping. I only finished it because it was our bookclub choice. 6 out of 6 of us thought it was awful. I read Sesame Street stories to my 3 year old son that have a better plot.
1,I don't watch Jerry Springer and I don't like this book,"I am a thoughtful, avid and intelligent reader who does not watch daytime talk shows. I found this book boring, offensive and pointless. Don't be bullied into thinking that you are not intelligent if you do not like this book."
2,Blah....don't know what the hoopla is about.,Wish that I hadn't wasted my time reading this book...too many good books out there.
4,"Deep, thought provoking, and intelectual....","I picked up The Reader from a local bookstore yesterday and finished it late last night. I was moved by the story and found the themes of love, morality, and honesty universal. There were so many layers in this novel that I was amazed that he could relate so much in such a short read. He is very blunt and to the point, which made it an easy read, but the subject matter gave it a depth that astounded me. His style reminded me of Albert Camu because his discriptions were real and beautiful without being over-discriptive, but it exuded a dark optimism that is difficult to express."
5,Reads like Phyllis Barrack's early work,"The cutting images and provocative use of the words ""and"" and ""the"" and even ""on"" were so original that the only literature they brought to mind was the excellent series of early novellas ""For the Love of Lee"" written by former ""Paterno Prize"" Winner Phyllis Barrack. To me, there is no higher praise. You must read this book."
4,Enthralling,"Once I started reading, I could not put it down. The author describes the complex relationship between Michael and Hanna in such a way you can almost tell what they are thinking and why. A different book that makes you think for a long time after you have finished it."
2,Not the best example of post war Germany,"I read this book in one night. I thought that there was going to be a climax of sorts; that something amazing or unexpected would happen; nothing did. I didn't like the way the author portrayed the characters. I thought that the beginning of The Reader was good, but I didn't enjoy the ending."
4,Statutory rape?,"""The Reader"" is a surprisingly easy read, while still thought provoking. Schlink is very effective in his choice of detail and scene, and employs descriptions of nature almost as a unifier.Unstated until the very last chapter, and then surprisingly by the Holocaust survivor, is whether Michael's affair at age 15 stunted his emotional life, whether in fact he was a victim of child abuse, what in the US would be a crime (statutory rape). The book does not provide enough of a picture of Michael's character before the affair to be sure, but we do know that his father was emotionally stunted, and that his family life was not a warm one.Incidentally, I think I may actually have enjoyed the book more for having seen the movie some time ago, and my wife agrees."
3,"Not a great, but a decent book","Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss about this book is. It's a little better than mediocre. It does read very fast though and would make for a good read on an airplane or over a summer weekend. It's not a book that will stick with me for any amount of time however..."
3,Confusing sentiments,"Something odd about this novel - I felt an uneasy distance between the narrating character and the events he narrates despite the fact that he is, theoretically, intimately involved in these events.The title confused me. A title generally points to the main character or the most significant theme. However, the ambiguity of this title and its referent is complicated by the fact that I'm not sure who is the main character: the narrator or the woman he writes about.The events span the time from adolescence to middle age of the narrator yet his voice and perspective remain the same. Maybe he is just not very bright and lacks the ability to look back on his younger self. Or maybe it is to do with the translation.And I had problems with the treatment of time. I had to flick back to work out when events happened in relation to each other."
4,well written,"The book, I thought was well written. The subject matter was interesting with a moral dilemma."
1,If this book didn't say Oprah Book Club...,"Nobody would read it. I found the plot quite slow and boring. I wonder how much Bernie and Carol paid Oprah to recommend this book. I will no longer read her selections because it's obvious that she's getting paid to pick this slop. The main characters are shallow, and I didn't believe them. I would have been better off watching Springer!"
1,It could have been so much more!,Once I started it I finished it merely on principle. I thought the story was flat and lacked development and interaction between characters. It could have been so much more. There was absolutely no spark to this story. I think that too many of Oprah's book choices are zoomed up the best seller list strictly because of her name and not for the enjoyment factor of the story. I think this choice really misses the mark.
1,"horrible, horrible book!","yay! another amazing (yeah right?!?!) book that operah ""recommends"" to be good. stay away from this bad writing! should get 0 stars, but there is no option for it."
4,"Quick read, thought provoking.",This book is Interesting holocaust story that moves very quickly. Gives you lots to ponder. Not as depressing as I expected.
2,Disappointing,"I found the book offerd a unique glimpse of some areas of the Holocaust, but the characters within the story come across as detached and with no emotional depth. Both Hanna and Michael seem like cardboard cutouts, and just totally disconnected. I think because of this, I was never invested in either of them and the anticipated 'love story' of the first chapter falls totally flat. Also the callous unemotional way Hanna behaves towards her young lover lets you know she is clearly broken, and a tregedy is yet to come. Her sudden departure was almost a given, as to me they never bonded in any real way. I also realised Hanna was probably illiterate from the start, so the big revealing 'secret' was a non-event."
4,"The Reader: Outstanding book, fair translation","This is a timely novel, during an age of awareness of the emotional impact upon a teen-ager of a sexual affair with an adult. This is not, I don't think, the main theme. That deals with the Nuremburg trials and the ambiguity of guilt when those without authority are left without orders in a confusing, unprecedented occasion.In my opinion, Oprah was right to choose this book. I first read it in a Spanish translation, then found out it was a book club selection and ordered it in English. I suspect the writing was better in German, but wholeheartedly recommend it nevertheless."
5,Surprising and different,I really enjoyed this book. It was unlike any other I've read. It was an easy read and kept my attention. I recommend it to everyone.
2,Contrived and disconnected,"Reading this work, I had the feeling that Schlink had come up with several reasonably good ideas for short stories, but then unwisely decided to knit them together into a novel. The trouble is, they don't assemble well. The result is a contrived, stiff and disconnected effort, with the whole adding up to less than the sum of its parts. A failure, though briefly, here and there, an interesting failure."
3,They were victims too?,"Light reading; attempts to sympathize with unwilling Holocaust perpetrators. The movie industry and news media have not been sympathetic to unwilling German participants, and there must have been many. Heck, I didn't think there were any!The book does capture the narrator's struggle with his own self-imposed standards. He is obsessed with Anna. Admitting that he still has feelings for her would probably bring him to a lower level than his parents who had ""tolerated the perpetrators in their midst"". If The Reader helps to minimize unjust animosity, then it has done its job."
2,Conflicted - both in content and theme,"This book is interesting in that the reviews are either 5 stars or 1-2 stars. People either love it or hate it - no middle of the road. I have read it once and will have to read it again before giving it an intelligent review. However, I think it is a book that everyone should read, just to gain their own opinion - it isn't something you should take someone else's opinion for. Kind of like ""Catcher in the Rye"" or ""Grapes of Wrath"" - you may not like the message or even enjoy the book - but you should read it."
3,Was Disappointed,"I thought this book was going to incorporate more history in the story. I had a hard time with the moral issues prevalent in the book, but at the same time was illuminated by how impressionable young people are. At the tender age of 15 major events can and most likely will have a lasting impression on that persons life. Was a quick read, but was disappointed. It was not all I expected."
3,Not for everyone,"One of the things that I admire most about Oprah and her Book Club selections is that she is exposing followers to such a wide range of literary styles. This is not a book for everyone. The characters are hard to sympathize with and the writing has a staccato, abrupt feel. Frankly, I didn't enjoy it. However, I did find it extremely well-written, exploring some intriguing themes about relationships; about the mesmerizing effects a first sexual partner can imprint on you for a lifetime; about pride, pragmatism and their sometimes horrifying consequences; and about post-WWII Germans growing up in the aftermath of their country's shame. It's a quick read--you may not fall in love with it, but it's worth a try, because you might enjoy the insights the author provides."
2,"Lacking depth, but still OK","There are some books in which the characters are extremely loveable. They are intriguing, interesting, and I enjoy reading about them. This did not prove to be the case, and the book did not live up to my original expectations. I read the reviews, saw the little ""Oprah"" symbol, and excitedly bought the book. But I was extremely disappointed. This book was missing something. I'm not exactly sure if I know what. Even still, the overall plot was excellent, and I think the story COULD have been absolutely fabulous. I guess it was worthwhile to read this, though I know I have read much, much better books in my lifetime."
2,Fast but not great read,"Fortunately you can finish this book in a couple of hours. If I'd had to spend more time on it I would have been VERY disappointed. It was an o.k. book but nothing to talk about. I won't be urging anyone I know to read it. I had been looking forward to reading it as the conversations about it on ""Oprah"" were interesting...much more so than the book!"
2,Kinda boring,I didn't have that feeling of not being able to put the book down. That's a great feeling. This was kinda depressing and colorless.
3,Interesting story line though a little shallow.,This book was easy to put down. The characters weren't fully developed
3,A question for other readers,A fascinating book and thought provoking. I am wondering if in fact the book referred to in the text is an actual book. A mother and daughter escaped from church and the daughter wrote a book that prompted the investigation. Can anyone shed any light on this?
5,"Excellent story, very touching","Nice quick read. The book leaves you with so many other questions. It is such a different book from the norm, it had me so drawn."
3,emotional,I felt pity for the main characters because if they had never met then their lives may have been different.Cindy
3,An intriguing story of love and loss,I really enjoyed how well the author captured Michael's innocent obsession with Hanna. Later on when you find out why she was so secretive everything fits together very well. The ending left me wanting more of an explanation of why things happened the way they did. Maybe I was just wishing that they would get back together because he confessed that he needed someone like her. Overall I thought the book was worth reading but not one of my favorites.
3,A quick read,"I did like the book, it was a very qucik read and held my attention. But for me to recommend a book to my friends it has to be outstanding... this was pretty good but only 3 stars. I was looking for it to get into the war crimes and characters more... maybe to book should have been longer?"
3,Ho Hum...am I the only one?,...I found myself getting very impatient with this novel even though it did offer an interesting glimpse into post wwII German attitudes through the eyes of a rather boring middle class character.
2,leaves you with more questions than answers,"This is an easy read, I picked it up because I needed something easy to read after taking a lot of hard college courses. It moves very fast, and there's a big twist. A typical Oprah book."
1,Paid but never received,"I submitted my order on 3/19, transfer of money was on 3/20. Delivery estimate: March 26, 2009 - April 10, 2009. It is now 4/23 and I still have not received my order. I have submitted a request to cancel my order along with a full credit. I am very disappointed!"
1,repugnant,"I find the three basic premises of this book so repugnant that I am blinded to any redeeming discussions of post-war German guilt. These premises are: (1.)the dysfunctional, abusive relationship that the young boy has with the older woman damages his ability to form relationships for rest of his life, (2.) the shame of being illiterate somehow excuses her from the horrors she perpetrated as a Nazi concentration camp guard, and (3.) treating the weak prisoners well before she selects them to be executed somehow mitigates her horrific crimes.I did not see Oprah, however, no amount of pontificating about ""complex"" and ""profound literature"" can get me past these basic tenets which are wrong, no matter how elegantly or passionately you spin the tale."
4,Will make you think!,"I started reading this book knowing very little about it other than its reviews calling it ""beautiful"" ""disturbing"" ""morally devastating"" and ""speaks straight to the heart."" Although perhaps not as disturbing or morally devastating as some reviews claim, I did find the story to be beautiful and one that spoke to my heart. I found myself truly caring about the characters, however bizarre they were (and the strange relationships they were part of).Anyone interested in post-war Germany and the aftermath of the Holocaust would enjoy this book. I found myself wondering several times whether this was a piece of non-fiction, considering how it certainly reads that way (it IS fiction, however).The print is fairly large and the pages narrow. I read this book in one day easily. I was drawn into the story easily. The questions of morality, ethics, and philosophy that this book brings up left me thinking long after putting this book down."
4,Uneven but well written and engaging,"This novel felt like three different novellas, tied together. This first, where a 15 year old has an affair with an older woman in Germany in the 30's, is quite good. Part 2, the Nazi war crime trial, is the least engaging. Part 3, the post-trial era, pulls together the first two parts, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. It is certainly the most emotional segment of the story. I heard the audio-book for this novel, and the reader was quite good and appropriate for this first person narrative. While I never quite felt as connected to the narrator as I would have liked, I enjoyed this original novel."
2,Reading in the dark,"The story of Michael Berg and Hanna has great potential but Schlink failed to explore the emotive value of each character.I empathized with Hanna's naivete and illiteracy. Yet, it seems that her character was mystified to the point of a non-entity.When Hanna asks the judge ""what would you have done?"", Schlink fails to embrace this theme and give it substance. Throughout the book there is a sense of incongruency and lack of flow."
3,A great short read.,"I thought The Reader from Bernard Schlink has a great narrative quality although and as one of the other reviewers mentioned it is not just a story it is a man growing to accept life, love and himself. I thought it was a bit too short and not as in depth as I usually like but all over a great read espeacially if your introducing yourself to Holocast and German Novels."
2,"Idea interesting but characters flat, undeveloped, immature","While I found the relationship between the boy and the woman objectionable, it isn't the reason I didn't care for the book. I found the writing sparse. The characters weren't fully developed and the reader was left not knowing hardly anything of their lives or feelings. It was an interesting idea for a story; however, I feel that more should have been said about the characters' lives and feelings and less about simply their repetitive sexual affair. The chapters are annoyingly short. The feelings of the narrator seem immature and undeveloped. I realize he is 15 at the beginning of the book, but 15-year-old boys can still be interesting. Besides, the narrator ages and still no real insight is gained. Skip this one. Read instead The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve, or Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson."
4,enlightened and moved,"I had never given it a thought on how the German people were victom themselves during times that were so differant than today. Oh, I am not excussing the horror that that country put upon the world, only trying to understand the complexities of it all. It has given me the opertunity to have great conversations with a few older friends that actually lived on the same street Hana lived during the sametime. My friends had no idea that that was going on right next door. And the emotional tramma that occured from having a long term sexual relationship with an older women who he really didn't know and how it affected his whole life. This book was stimulating because of the history in German life and mentality, before and after the war."
4,The Reader,"I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I picked it up. It was entertaining and thought-provoking, but it did have a bit too much ""telling"" for my particular taste. Still, it was a very good read."
3,Lacks Emotion,There is no need for me to rehash the plot given the number of reviews and the movie treatment which has alerted many to this story. What I will cover is its length as a novel (or novella) which provides a sparse and focused account. This was a redeeming factor for the book given the much trod ground it covers. The moral ambiguities presented by both characters are clinically interesting but I was never drawn in emotionally. The Reader is definitely a worthy effort but I was left thinking more of the deft twist in circumstances that led Hanna to her fate and the random choice of Michael to join her on part of her journey rather than the larger 'good versus evil' and atonement aspects the author intended.
4,It will make you think.,"This book all at once is a tear jerker as well as a thought provoker. Nowhere before had I ever seen the ideas of sin, forgiveness, guilt, and duty explored in quite this way. Before it is over, we hate what the obvious villian has done, but we cannot hate her as much as she seems to hate herself, and isn't this punishment enough? At least in the American community, not many people understand the guilt that pervaded Germany's collective conscience for the Holocaust. Some of it they deserved, but how much of that guilt rightfully belonged to whom? What generation or generations should or did pay the price?"
2,A Bit Dark & Depressing,"As a fan of the Oprah Book Club selections, I was a bit disappointed by this particular book. The Reader is quite somber and dark. Given the topic (holocaust) this is entirely understandable. This aside, I found the novel to be a bit of a ""downer"" and not uplifting or motivating in any way. Perhaps that is not the intent? However, if you are craving a read that will fill your spirit with the ""warm fuzzies,"" The Reader is not it."
2,Schlink Stinks,"Well, maybe he's not that bad, but it sort of rhymes. From the title of my review, one knows that I did not enjoy this book. Almost the entire time I was reading the book, I felt grey on the inside. Only when Michael begins recording his readings aloud for Hannah do I ever feel a little warmer to this story. I thought the book was predictable and simple. Hannah's ""secret"" was apparent to me after the first few hints. This novel was no fun, and I read for fun."
4,The philosophical dilemma of the post-nazi generation,"The Reader is an adolescent who has an affair with an older mysterious woman who suddenly disappears. Several years later, they meet again, in a courtroom where she is sentenced to life emprisonment for the crimes she commited as a guardian in a concentration camp. From there, his destiny will be the one of a whole generation of Germans who have to face the guilt and the shame of the horrors their parents commited."
5,Such Powerful Stuff,This book is one of the most powerful I have ever read. Who knew that such a small bokk could throw such a power punch.
4,Wonderful read,"While in the beginning it's a bit difficult to really get interested in the storyline and it all seems to be going nowhere, the involvement comes suddenly and I couldn't put it down. And when I finished I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's one of the few books that stay with you because of the impression they make."
2,The Reader,"A dark, sad book. Interesting in a historical, personal narrative way, but not a fun read..."
2,sophomoric,"For a book that gets as many positive comments as this one does, I had high hopes, which were quickly dashed. The writing is elementary, the characters poorly drawn. Melodramatic."
2,I hoped it would get better...,"...but it never did. The big secret was a let down, and the characters were void, ""numb"" was the word the author used. This book is alright for those who have a good imagination and can fill in the emotions and motives of the characters, but isn't that the writer's job? To be fair, there were a few pages in the book that should be read twice because they are quite profound (and there is also a need to get something for your time), but as a whole, the book may have lost itself in the translation."
2,"Sort of misses the holocaust, doesn't it?","This book is about a woman who is willing to go to prison rather than own up to the fact she cannot read. I thought that was a little silly, especially when there were holocaust issues to consider. The whole book reminded me of that wonderful scene in ""Life is Beautiful,"" in which the German is interested in puns, and the Italian is interested in life and death."
3,Did I miss the point??,"I found the book interesting and read it easily. Did not find it boring but yet I kept wondering if I had missed something, if there was something lost in the translation. I kept waiting for the plot to go someone more intense but it did not. I'm having a friend read it to be sure I did not miss something. Readable but largely unsatisifying. Don't understand why it is a NY Times notable book!!"
2,"An interesting plot, but disappointing in the end","I was instantly intrigued by a summary I read in the paper of this book. I finally purchased it and immediately began reading. It was slow at first and I only kept reading b/c I thought it would pick up - but it didn't. There really was no climax and the ending was depressing. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great plot, but it did not live up to my expectations."
3,Interesting and intriguing,"An interesting and original twist on a worn theme. A unique thought process that delved further than than the ""facts"", and delt more with happenings and emotions."
4,Thought provoking and beautifully written...,I thought The Reader was a wonderful book with characters that could be easily identified with. My only qualms with the book were that it did tend to be a little slow at times and occassionally a bit hard to believe. I think that everyone who has read and enjoyed Camus' The Stranger should read The Reader as well. It was beautiful in its tragedy and heartbreak and yet not the least bit preachy or overdone. Simplicity worked well for The Reader.
2,"strong characters, thin beauty","This book has several areas of lovely, gripping description. But neither the verbal beauty of the book nor its plot is powerful enough to hold the reader. The book's strength lies in its characters; both the narrator and Hanna are strong, unique people who shine through the sometimes-oversimplified language used to describe them. I think the readers who will get the most out of this book are the ones who can relate to the characters--to their personalities, their experiences, or their guilt--regardless of the inadequacies of the text."
4,"tough, but incredible","There were parts of this that were a bit hard to read, but I don't regret it at all. A beautiful, sad story. I was profoundly impressed."
4,Not a bad story,One gets weary of WW2 novels but this was clever. Young man meets an older lady and has a relationship that becomes part of his life and hers. Fast forward and back and the tale is complete. She is constant through their relationship. He waffles and stays close. His connection keeps him from developing as an adult male. She completes her journey through life. The main concern is that his voice never changes much as he grows older. She stays consistant.
3,Wonderfully written,"I had to set my environment to read this book of ""literature,"" as the book is so labeled. I eased into my couch (it's a cushy couch), tossed a blanket over me, took a sip of my tea, and then lifted the first page of The Reader. In one afternoon I read the book cover to cover. I sat there wondering what would happen to Michael Berg (the narrator). How would these events affect the rest of his life? How would they affect my own? It made me realize the impact of one decision, not only on one's own life, but on many. I can't tell you what happened otherwise I would give away the story, but let me say that the story was told simply though the topics were far from simple. I found a connection with Berg's reflectiveness and hoped him well. A very good book."
4,Great Read!,I really loved this book. It has so many different levels that it can leave one pondering the issues over and over in their mind a week after they have read it.
2,The Reader,"I have just finished reading ""The Reader"" and must say, that I disagree with the previous reviews. I'm not a particularly well-read reader but found this book slow-paced and I nearly gave up on it several times. I also found ""the secret"" very obvious from the start and not a very believable or realistic reason as to why Hanna would take the blame for the wicked event which took place.Michael's behaviour during the trial was at times very frustrating and at the end of the book when he could have made amends he failed her again. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone but value and appreciate other readers opinions."
1,Oprah is a hack.,"I haven't read this book yet, but I never will because it's on Oprah's Book club. All these books ride on the success of Oprah's name. They all stink. We need to stop reading these retarded books and giving Oprah all this power. I might have to start my own book club. So there."
1,This was a disturbing book for me.,"I found the subject of a young man having an affair with an older woman disturbing. There was too much focus on the affair, and not enough on the real story; the woman's involvement in the Hitler times. This is the first Oprah pick I have not liked."
3,"The novel is brittle - the film, however, is magnificent!","This is one of those rare instances in which the film is better than the novel. Kate Winslet is beyond belief in the role - as is everyone else in the movie. Another film you might like that comes up to this one, on the same subject: ""The Music Box"" with Jessica Lange. Wow. In fact, that one is even more vivid, however, thanks to the performances, ""The Reader"" is also a major stand-out."
1,Over-rated and pointless.,"Maybe it's the translation, but what was the point of this book? It struck me as entirely superficial. The one interesting point raised is how the generation after the Nazis felt, and how they coped, and it is glossed over and dropped.Don't bother."
3,A good read,"I just had to write a response to Cybertoe. I enjoyed this book which, incidentally, I purchased before knowing about the recommendation by Oprah. I suggest that you read (even partially) a novel before critising it as 'retarded'.Jeez...armchair ignoramuses make me so mad! I bet that Cybertoe secretly has a heap of ""recommended by Jerry Springer""s..."
4,very different story line provokes thinking,I bought this book because it is an Oprah book and it was on the bestseller's list. I am glad I did. The story line is like none I have ever read before. It made me think what I would have done in the subject's shoes. It was worth reading.
2,disappointing,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed by this book. It might have worked better for me as a short story."
3,"intriguing concept, limpid execution","The Reader could've been one of those truly riveting, thought-provoking books which linger in the minds of readers because of the humanness of its characters against events and conditions devoid of humanness. However, Mr. Schlink's executions renders the characters, especially the protagonist, so detached and aloof and without human depth that the story itself losses its sting. The first part was exquisitely written but once the narrator grows up, the novel falters. Mr. Schlink seems fearful of empowering the narrator with anything more than the basest and most rudimentary of emotions when the situation, the importance of the story itself, called for it. A good read, but not the one it has been made out to be..."
1,Slick Holocuast Denial - Antisemitism Not Mentioned,Has nobody noticed that Bernard Schlink gets away with a very smooth trick in these pages - never once mentions antisemitism as a cause of the holocaust? Incredible.
2,The reader,"I have to say that I really did not enjoy this book. Thankfully, it was very short. I do think that it has alot of good writing in it, I just never got pulled in to the story and never really connected with the characters. I also thought that it was quite predictable."
3,sex and crimes,the reader is about a young boys life who grows into a mature man.one day the boy is walking home from school and gets sick.a woman who sees him vomit goes to his aid and helps the kid.she cleans him and bathes him.he visits her another day to thank her and he soon falls in love with and they start meeting everyday for sex.the reader could be labeled a love story as well as a tragic story.its basically about a kid who falls in love with an older woman and a woman who hides a secret.a good read.
2,Not as good as I thought.,The book to me was very boring. It did not keep my attention and I forced myself to finish it.
2,Just wondering...,"is ""The Reader"" so deep that I just don't get it? Or is is boring and shallow? I was interested in the beginning during the initial meeting of Michael and Hanna, but it went down hill from there. And Hanna would rather rot in prision than reveal her awful secret (illiteracy) but revealed it in the end to the warden? And how would we react if Hanna was 15 and Michael was 36? At least it was a short read."
3,Confused Reaction,"I was really excited to read this book, and the writing was amazing. I read it all in one sitting but mostly because I was waiting for it to get good. After I read the book I was confused as to weather or not I liked it, I loved the way he wrote, the imagery and sybolism, but the plot itself was lacking."
2,short but long read,"Everyone suggested that it was a real quick read-short in length and you can't put it down. Well, I had a hard time picking it UP!!! I despised Hanna even before her past was exposed. The book was hard to get through but I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I found it very disappointing!!!!!"
2,This book did not take me anywhere.,"While I was captured by the beginning of The Reader, I soon found myself longing to put it down, and had to force myself to finish. When I did, I realized why. When finished, the reader hasn't learned any lessons, there was nothing to take with you. I wasn't sure what the story's moral was, nor was I sure that I wanted to know."
2,Disappointing,"I had great expectations for this book, as it was an Oprah book selection and dealt with a subject that I find intriguing--the Holocaust and the concentration camps. However, I could not get into this book. I didn't think Hanna's character was developed enough, and I just couldn't get into the main character at all. It was mildly entertaining, but that's the most I can say for it."
2,Illiteracy is bad,"I was disappointed with this book. The early scenes when the young Michael was with Hanna were good; afterward the story just had too much telling, not enough showing. In the end the book just felt like a public service announcement against illiteracy. If you don't learn to read, this is what will happen to you!!"
4,Sexy and Mysterious,"I really thought this book was right on time. You can actually read this whole book in one setting. Even if you don't, you'll never have to reread to remember what the book was about. The setting and plot stays with you and actually wants to make you take the place of one of more characters that are presented in the book. This is one book you'll never have to (you may want to though) pick up again. It's just that interesting; you wouldn't want to leave anything out when explaining because the book's just that good. There couldn't be a briefer explanation. This book was recommended by Oprah's Book Club."
3,A lot to do about nothing.,"This book is well written, and flows smoothly from chapter to chapter. It is a book of love, war, lust and ultimately disappointment. The book is full of disappointment and timidness. The writer does not make any progression throughout the book and ends up in same place he started. The heroine of the book is a female named Hanna, she is the only one that evolves, but to late in life for it to matter.If you want to sit back relax, and read a story in the post WWII era this is a great book. However, if you are looking to increase your understanding of the world or find a deeper meaning in life, you will be truly disappointed with the Reader."
4,Memorable read!,"Powerful book that fleshes out the two main characters extraordinarily well. This book reminds me of the book, ""Doubt"", in that it leaves you with lingering thoughts regarding the intentions of the main characters."
3,not my style,"thought i found the prose very beautiful, i found it hard to get through this book. it was tedious and slow."
3,the reader...,"I agree with the masses that this was a good read, it did have twists and turns, but still worth it. Unlike many, I did have compassion for Michael. He was stripped of his innocense at such a young age. This, I feel, set the stage of aloofness and depression that seemed to consume him throughout the rest of the book. Of course, he was interested in sex.. he was 15, but he was taken advantage of by the older woman in a very sick way. This odd obsessive love affair affected his every relationship; from his father to other females his own age. Hanna was his teacher in the beginning of the novel and later you see Michael become her teacher. Hanna taught him about passion, however warped it was. Then in the end you see that he taught her literacy and kindness. I would not rank this book very high with other stories of the Holocaust, but i think the story is a good one. I considered it more a focus on Michael as the Reader... her Reader."
3,This book got me through Jury Duty,This book was very interesting. My grandma grew up in Germany during the war and this story took me to that time. I really enjoyed the story of the strange relationship that these two people shared. The ending took a strange twist but that just made it all the more real.
1,Disappointed in The Reader,"I have to admit to reading this book due to the movie hype I have seen recently of it. That said, I'm certain this will be one of the rare instances we find the movie to be better than the book.While the story line had such promise, the principals are obviously wounded but boring. Character development would have made this so much more interesting and a little more tutiludge of the era would have drawn us into the period."
1,Unispired storytelling.,I was very disappointed in this book. It was an insipid story told with very little style or emotion. The author's attempts to enlighten are pathetically juvenile. This may be the last time I follow one of Oprah's recommendations. A true waste of my time.
3,I dont know how i feel,I read this book in about three days because i had very high hopes for it. The hole time though i felt like it was going to get better but never did. Im not saying its a bad book but i just didnt like the direction that it went.
5,"The ""Remarkable"" Reader","The Reader is one of the most haunting books I have read in quite a long time. As someone who reads 2-4 books a month, this book stopped me in my tracks. The questions raised by the author are difficult, if not impossible to answer; therefore, making them stay with you, turning them over and over in your mind. The question of ""collective guilt"" is very interesting. Additionally, the main character, Hanna Schmitz, is complex in her simplicity. This is a ""must read"" for anyone who is a serious reader."
2,Interesting...,"The writing was very simple, however it seems like some things might have gotten mixed up in the translation at times. It was interesting in a kind of ""passing the time"" kind of way."
2,"A Depressing, Dismal Tale","I did not enjoy reading The Reader for several reasons. I'm usually attracted to very strong characters, and the boy/law student allowed himself to be a victim throughout the story. He allowed his teenage affair with Hannah to affect his whole life. I couldn't respect his attitudes.I thought that Hannah would be the strong character. She endured prison and overcame her illiteracy, but then killed herself at the very moment her life could have begun.I hate to call a book a waste of time, but this was close to it for me."
3,"Not interesting, but very thought-provoking","As an American living in Germany I have confronted many of the issues that are addressed in this book. I was especially taken aback by the analysis of what the second (and in my case the third) generation should do with the information it now has of the Holocaust. In my time here I have visited several of the terrible concentration camps, and each time I am just as horrified at what I see. I think that this book does a good job of addressing these issues. While I can't say that I loved the book (the relationship between the young boy and 35 year old woman was especially troubling to me), it really made me think."
2,Interesting,"""The Reader"" was a partially interesting book. I appreciated the spare prose, but it fell slack too often (many ""I don't remember"" phrases) and weakened the novel. Examples of spare prose that sustain tension throughout the story are ""The Retreat"" by Aharon Appelfeld (deals with the beginnings of the Holocaust) and ""The Liar"" by Martin Hansen (different subject matter, but a ""dark secret"" theme).The early relationship between the boy and Hannah was the best part of the book. If the rest of the story had been as detailed and taut, the impact would have been much stronger. Instead, the obviousness of the secret and the glosses over key events blurred other sections.I did like the ending's restraint; neat explanations or happy endings would have completely belied all that came before."
2,Story is vehicle for important message,"The author makes important points about responsibility to other people. However, the story and characters seem to be tools to deliver his message. The book reads well, but the characters are not convincing. However, it is more interesting than reading a philosophy book."
2,Could have been much better,"This book has an intriguing premise, but it underdelivers. Example: The main character gets married in one paragraph and divorced in the next. It certainly didn't pull on my heartstrings."
2,"An important and well written book. However, VERY boring.","This book has a very important message and is extremely well written. I loved the author's style which is simple and not overly wordy. However, I did not like a single character that I met in this book. Perhaps that was intentional. The whole time I was reading it I had to ask myself why I didn't just put it down. It's a book that must be finished. It is important. It's just not entertaining."
2,The tale of young lust and an older woman's secret,"I thought the book started well, telling the story of the boy and his relationship with this German woman. Once the affair ended, the story was lost in what he experiences in law school and how he finds out what happened to the woman after he last saw her.They never talked again. It took forever to get to the point of the book and her secret.It was a good story that could've been exploited better in the book."
4,Impressive,"Throughout the book, Michael talks about different images of Hanna that he can always recall (i.e. Hanna holding out a towel for him, Hanna biking, Hanna in his father's study, Hanna by the swimming pool, etc.). After finishing this novel, I found myself recalling the same images of Hanna and trying to make sense of her character. This was impossible to do, of course, because Schlink depicts his characters as so detached from each other that we can't make sense of who they are through their interactions. The numbness that Michael refers to in the second part of the novel is so poignant and relevant to out times as is his comment that tragedies sometimes become mere cliches that no longer interest people. Not so uplifting, but quite memorable."
3,A Lost Love,"The Reader is a the story of a lost love. Bernhard Schlink examines guilt, sorrow, and regret in the relationship between Michael Berg and his companion, Hanna. Despite their age gap of 21 years, the two develop a powerful relationship in which they become dependent on each other. Upon their mysterious division, Michael finds his life as one without significant meaning. Upon their reunion years later, Michael comes to the realization of his own importance in Hanna's life. The course of Hanna's life following the reunion becomes once again dependent on Michael. The conclusion signifies their need for one another that was never fully satisfied. The story is both deep in thought and easy to comprehend, making it an enjoyable yet perplexing read."
4,Difficult material but worthwhile,This is one of those books of which you either like it or not. Maybe is not an option. Great book overall!
2,A COMPLETE BORE!,"I kept reading, hoping it was going to get better but by the last page i was still hoping. It was a good storyline and had a lot of potential but just didn't go anywhere. I usually like Oprah's picks but this one was a real disappointment."
2,immoral and hurtful,i have been following the book club for some time now and this is the fourth book i have read. i am ashamed to say every book has to have a certain portion of smut in it to keep us readers interested. this book i thought was just wrong though. i feel compassion for hannah and having a confusing misfortune but to take advantage of an innocent child is a sickness. i can not support a book that displays this context even if it is just for entertainment. i would feel devastated to learn another woman could do this to my child. it is sexual abuse. better books could be written by the author.
2,could have dug so much deeper,"i've read all of the oprah books and this is the first one that i've been really disappointed by. as some other reviewers mention, the storyline is unique and intriguing. however, both the story and the characterizations lack so much depth that not only do i not care about the protagonist, i don't care how the story will end. if the book was much longer than it was, i probably would have put it down before finishing it. of course, if it was much longer, it may have contained the depth necessary to make it a great book."
1,the reader,4/5/09 .. order placed 3/6/09 still have not received ... I have emailed seller and still no response.Not very happy
4,And Equal Sequel,"Just when you thought it was over for Bob, back he comes. One of BC's best characters is resurrected in this sequel to the hilarious ""The Man Who Loved Working Women"", and the introduction of deeper beings only adds to the storyline. Definitely designed for a dual or split set, this play stays true to Chris Lindsay's form, continuing the pace set by the first. I have shared this with a few friends and the reaction was unanimously positive."
4,An Enjoyable Play,"Don't be fooled by the title, because this play is anything but dark and sinister. Lindsay has done a skillful job of incorporating wit and humour into the normally disturbing topics of hell, devils and demons. The characters' antics are sure to generate a smile or chuckle. Prepare for a funny and enjoyable read."
4,A Bad Day In Hell,"Two Demons and a Dead Man is a great sequel to Chris Lindsay's first screenplay, The Man Who Loved Working Women. With the strength of some of the original characters and the introduction of new ones, Lindsay succeeds in tackling the touchy topic of Hell in a hilarious fashion while adding in a humourful dose of insanity, love, lust and religion. Don't let the title fool you-- there is nothing serious about this play, nor its subject as the playwright takes you on a ride to Hell-- and back-- and lets you be the judge."
4,"A quick, easy to understand story","Gandt starts his fiction career wonderfully. He takes his first hand knowledge of life for F/A-18 pilots, tactics and naval life in general and composes a great story with several subplots that allow for the story of Brick Maxwell to continue in future volumes.Keeping it simple, the main character, Maxwell, returns to a carrier squadron after several years test piloting and as a NASA astronaut. He must deal with a hot-shot commanding officer with something bordering personal hatred for him, gender politics of the new Navy, and an Iraqi threat following the first Gulf War. Gandt neverloses focus despite having so much to contemplate.If you like this one, try Punk's War and Punk's Wing by Ward Carroll for similar life and battle stories in the Navy."
4,Good military story,"Good story, compelling characters. I liked this book and give it 4 stars. I hope that my review helps you!"
3,With Hostile Intent,"With Hostile Intent.A good yarn, took a bit of effort to stay engaged at times but enjoyable none the less. Good technical description, a little light on action for my tastes but ok considering the story was more about shipboard/military politics."
3,"A Good Read, But..........","I like the style of this authors writing and the technical aspects of the aircraft carrier, the flying and ground warfare etc. However, the author really needs to consider the plot of the story. A rogue pilot manages to acquire a few Mig 29 fighters with their ground crew, and a submarine with a view to attacking an American fleet. Plus there is a spy on the carrier that is going to assist the submarine in sinking the very ship that is under him. I don't think so. This writer has huge potential but needs to look at the believeability factor. I finished the story but it was too predictable, and for me it would almost fall into an action Mills and Boon catagorie."
4,"Great book, great read...","A book I found hard to put down. Shows me and all readers just what is possible in the world, even though fiction, it could happen."
5,The Best of Bob Gandt,"Bob Gandt has found his forte: riveting fiction, combining his extensive experience as a naval aviator with a highly imaginative mind. He's up there with Clancy with this gem. I could't put it down and can't wait for the second in this compelling and timely series."
5,great,"This is another good smap album. It contains many fun, upbeat songs and one of their famous singles, the ballad ""Lion Heart."" Personally, however, my favorite song on this album is Takuya's solo ballad, ""Shiosai."""
1,One of the worst art books I have seen.,"Karen Kilimnik Drawings is a large format book that fails miserably because most of the photos of the artwork are out-of-focus and blurry. You'll have to see it to believe it, but when you do see it you'll wonder how a book as poorly made as this even gets printed. There's nothing else to say I'm afraid. This is horrible. Buyer beware: you have been warned!"
1,Clear crap in a bottle,I tried using this instead of my regular nail glue; the nails were coming off within the first day. I ended up losing four nails before the next day. The rest came off by the end of the week. What exactly is the point of this stuff if it does not adhere artificial nails to natural nails?Terrible. Heartily encourage you to buy something far better.
2,Big Bondini,This glue did not work well for me at all. It is not strong. My fake nails popped off easily with this glue
4,So-so but needs more in depth stuff,This doesn't really go in depth. I learned a few new things but it didn't really change my way of thinking. To get further and do more I recommend getting a book that looks at practical issues and actual Web site promotion. A great hands-on book for promotion is Stanek's Increase Your Web Traffic. Use Net Gain while your in the fuzzy stage. Use Increase after/during the phase when you build your Web site
5,Valuable book for community organisers,"Like magazine publishers are creating a sort of community by the interests every single time the latest print arrives on your desk. This is pretty much the same thing we have been doing with our customer base of our magazine portfolio for a year, so god bless John and Arthur writed this book, and told to us that we are on the right track.The book gives very valuable perspectives, but the case is not in the book, but your own specific business environment, and the point is very tough to find. This is not so called ""how-to"" do it. So don't wait too much. The perspectives are the greatest thing here.Executive Account Manager J.Lystimaki"
2,Good only if you haven't used the net ever,"This book is useful for novices that don't know anything about the Net; spent no time on chat rooms, have not cruised the web, and never seen an online ad. This book only looks smart, but it's at best a like the telephone book - accurate but irrelevant, at worst, an excuse for inaction.I'd buy if I had Dilbert's boss and had to show him/her that McKinsey consultants said it was ok to do things like customer service and salelson the net. Turned out... it wasn't me."
2,Lot of Hype,"After seeing this book advertised everywhere, I finally capitulated and read it. I was disappointed. The authors talk in such broad generalities that makes it difficult to seewhat the challenges are in electronic commerce. There is a lot of push by a lot of the consulting firms about communities. Communities, online, are nothing new as a business idea. Just recognizingthat communities exist and are a good idea seemsto be key idea behind the book. In summary, I wasdisappointed by the lack of detail in this book.-- Prof. Ravi Kalakota"
2,"Straight Line Depreciation, from Five Stars to Two.","This book was probably five stars when it was published - in 1997. However, too much has changed since then, obviously through no fault of the authors. I knew I was in trouble when the authors raved about Motley Fool and asked ""can online trading be far behind?"" Save your money."
3,good learning exercise for old dogs,"Those experienced in this emerging industry (and who have read Kelly, Negroponte, and Rheingold) will find little new in Net Gain. It seems clear that it's a primer for frightened senior managers seeking to get to grips with this thing called ""the Internet"" that they hear their children prattling on about all the time. Wrapping it in a HBS Press cover and slapping on a couple McKinsey names will ensure that successful executives won't be embarassed to be seen reading it in the First Class section."
4,Must-read book for investors in online businesses,"This book explains the economics of online businesses and virtual communities. It is a must-read for investors who are skeptical of the high valuations of publicly-traded, start-up online busnisses."
4,Excellent summarization of a rapidly evolving arena.,Another conceptual masterpiece from Harvard Press. The book is a speculative venture tieing together many of the rapidly evolving trends that are just now starting to emerge. Its fairly readable too!
1,Net Gain is a Net Loss.,Although this book claims to be geared to the senior executive _and_ the entrepreneur there is little info for the latter. Besides the fact that many of us do not have 1-2M or even 15M lying around which is the assupmtion. The much touted computer model that prescribes the increasing returns of virtual communities characterized in the book is not to be seen.

3,"Good Subject, Poor Substance","As a cyberpreneur myself, I was not able to find many enlightening points out of my reading.More value could have been added from recent developments in online marketing, co-petition & co-evolution, strategic globalization, and changing dynamics of high-tech business.Wish to see more books on similar subjects."
2,A fair work that has aged quickly.,"This is a very dry guide as to how businesses can get into the online business.Published in 1997, it is written in consultant speak, ie most of the prose is buzzwords that quickly became outdated or their own cutesy phrases to describe aspects of the online community.If the clients at whom this work is aimed actually finished and acted upon its content I would be shocked.The authors, who are obviously intelligent, should have realized how perishable this work is, and should have considered revising it annually.Had this not been required text for a class, I would never have bothered."
1,Typical of McKinsey consultants,"Anyone that has ever worked with the famed McKinsey group will recognize the pattern instantly. (1) Start the conversation at the highest level necessary to divide, confuse, and conquer, (2) achieve a sense of confusion, (3) draw insight from the clients or historical case studies, and (4) present YOUR ideas back to you as something terribly insightful and/or brilliant. Basically - what you get here is probably something you've already implemented or at least considered, but only packaged in a totally undeciferable and unrealistic utopia."
4,A must read for anyone interested in the Internet industry,"I work for a leading on-line community and for me this book was required reading. The concept of virtual communities and the transfer of power from the provider to the consumer through the control of information is spot-on.Check out sites like Deja.com, Zagat.com, Restaurantrow.com, Consumerreports.com and Comparenet.com and you'll see the evolution of the transition to a member generated content community. There is a reason NBC just bought 66% of Xoom and Yahoo paid $4.7 billion for GeoCities. Today these community web-sites are built around sharing interests and ideas, in the future they will have a much more practical utilitarian function - the sharing of information which leads to an enlightened experience and purchase decision. The companies that foster this developement will surely profit from it."
3,Member Generated Content??,"Great book, but I find the buzz about content so broad, it is in some ways meaningless. Can we depend on member generated content? What about the quality, richness & validity of this content? Should site organizers be able to monitor forums of member generated content? Will they have to plant content that appears to be written by members? What if members either don't contributue, or do so in a way that isn't valuable to the overall goal of the site? Any recommendations for more reading in the area of member generated content?"
4,Easy to follow,"Everybody seems to be an expert when it comes to internet commerce and marketing. I've read a lot of junk on this topic and much of what passes for new information is simply a rehash of some fairly lightweight (and doubtful) information. However, Net Gain is a refreshing departure from the norm. The authors focus on specifically why, what, and how the internet should be ncorported into your business. If you're interested in understanding how to do it right, I recommend this book."
3,Dated,"Overall, this book was good. It has a lot of good ideas about how to reach your students. My main issue, however, is that this book is quite dated. A lot of the activities simply would not work today as we do not have floppy disks, card catalogues, or no computer knowledge.I think I might actually use about 1/4 of this book because of dated nature.Furthermore, some of the activities are too advanced for the average high school psychology teacher. Luckily, I teach AP Psychology but my wife, who teaches regular psychology can not use more than a few activities.Overall, not a bad book and you will find some activities useful. Is it worth the cost for those activities? You decide."
3,Needs updating,"APA really needs to update this text as it is close to 10 years old now, and many of the supplies needed for the activities are difficult to obtain."
2,93.2% silly,"I enjoyed a recent houseboat vacation to Lake Powell with a couple friends and we caught a bunch of fish and had a lot of fun and took a bunch of pictures. My buddy was putting together a DVD slide show of the trip and wanted some music suggestions to correlate with the photos, which prompted me to purchase this CD. It's hokey, but I found one tune that worked, so it was worth the $$. But if you're wanting to be entertained....this ain't the CD to buy unless you're a redneck."
4,Strong Trainer!,"After reviewing a couple of indoor trainers online I decided to give it a try and take the chance with the cycleops fluid 2. I am impressed by the good quality of the craftsmanship as well for the easy setup to start using it just 15 minutes after unboxing. I found it quite silent, and the buzzing I heard was from my mountain rugged tire, I am sure that changing it to a slick one will reduce in 80% the noise.The Trainer is quite good, I would give it a 5 star rating if not for the price, but as a initial setup looking forward to use it for at least 3 years it is worth the investment.I am using a mountain bike 26"" wheel and it was not necessary to use the optional accessories. I strongly recommend considering a cycle computer that help you keep up with the pace/cadence, distance, and speed. I personally use a heart rate monitor, and a cycle computer with this trainer and I see myself riding several miles.Good option!"
2,Barely Fits 29er,"I was looking for a bike trainer so I can bike indoors when it's cold outside. The trainer barely fits a 29"" wheel, the tire just barely touches the ground and will scrape against the frame of the trainer. Also it's incredibly noisy with the tires I have. Also as an engineer I can say this device is not made terribly well and way overpriced. Will be returning."
3,Do I have a problem?,"This is my first trainer. I have used it 3 times. Easy enough to set up, but it's making noises that make me wonder if something is wrong. Once it gets warmed up, there seems to be a combination of clicking and sqeaking sounds. I have a new bike, and I liked getting the rear skewer included with the trainer."
2,I don't get it,It's probably user error on my part but I don't get it. The kit assembled easily and the bike mounted to it fairly easily.But I couldn't quite get it to work well. It was either way too easy or impossible to move. I didn't get a good work out from the device and finally gave up.Again - it's probably user error on my part but I don't get it. Why is this thing so great?
1,Frustrated for now...,"I cannot give a good review yet because I received the unit without all the parts. When I called the 800 number on the operating manual, I hear, ""I'm sorry. The extension you are calling is not available at this time...."" yada yada. So how do I get Amazon to send me the parts? I don't want to send the whole unit back. I just want the L-bolt, carriage bolt and nut. Hmmm. I think I will go to my local bike shop tomorrow and see what they can do. I paid for expedited shipping so I would be able to set this thing up on my first available night off...(I work nights) and get my program going. So, hopefully Amazon will make this right quickly. I'm just not sure how to get the right person's attention to get it taken care of. When it's corrected, I'll write a revised review."
1,Rear Tires Do Not Fit,"We bought this for some indoor knee rehab. Tried to attach two bikes to it, smallish women's Trek 7200 and a larger men's Trek 520. In both cases the rear wheel remains firmly on the ground. Undecided as to whether we will simply return the product or try to prop up the side balance legs on some blocks of wood."
1,Great - until it fails ... again ... and again,"Within six months of purchase, my unit was leaving a mess on the floor when spinning and LOUD. I purchased it so it would be quiet - I had the TV volume jacked up near top-notched and it was still too loud for me.So, a company rep brought a replacement to the bike shop, and one was delivered to me.I noticed the leak in the one from the bike shop within hours of bringing it back.The current one is making loud vibrational noises on the floor because it won't stay secured to the base and shakes.Pretty ticked off.Not an experiment to make with over $300. FAILED after SIX MONTHS.And AGAIN.And AGAIN.It plays great at the shop when you're trying it out. It DOESN'T STAY THAT WAY.Heads up. I've heard Kurt Kinnetic doesn't leak. Worth looking in to."
4,CycleOps Fluid 2: smooth riding,"I was skeptical about riding indoors, but the Fluid 2 has made those winter rides much more enjoyable. It isn't too loud, so I'm able to watch a movie or TV while I ride. And the Raceday DVD that came with it has helped me get better at warming up for races. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
4,simple to use and effective,"A well made product very quite in operation. Instructions could be improved,once you figure it out it is very easy to install and use .I liked it so well I purchased another for my wife."
2,Overpriced for what it is...,"Although the trainer works ok there were numerous difficulties setting it up. The quick release lever they provided was too large for my bike, so apart from the over $300 price tag, I had to go to the bike shop and get a new quick release lever. In the product description there is no mention of the fact that this trainer requires a certain type and length of quick release lever, which may have been helpful and informed my purchase decision. Once assembled it seems to lean a bit...I'm debating returning the item, but at 25lbs it will cost me some $ just to send it back. Overall it is not a bad product, but I really can't recommend it either..."
3,It is ok.,I would like to say it has a nice road feel. However it vibrates at speeds over 15mph. It is also louder than my old mag trainer.
4,"Good cycle equipment, Bad assemble instructions","I received the CycleOps and climbing block on schedule. I am a mtn biker, so I changed my knobby wheel with a training wheel and it's sturdy, quiet, no vibration and easy to use. I use the trainer 4 days a week.However, I gave it a 4 star rating because the assembly instruction was not clear, super confussing. I had to go online at other sites and complete the set up based on other customers whom purchased the same or similar item.I love it and would definetly recommend this product to friends.ACSMassachusetts"
4,Nice product!,Sold my Cycle Ops Mag and upgraded to the Fluid 2. Much quiter and doesnt get as hot. Great product.
4,Indoor cycling aid,"I purchased this unit from another online retailer and it was delivered in about three days. Setup was fairly easy, but my bike has ""nuts"" on the back wheel and the included quick release skewer was not usable due to this. The ""nuts"" did fit into the unit which took about 15 minutes to set up. I had to check the FAQ on Cycle Ops website to check into the use of the trainer with a bike that did not have a quick release rear wheel hub as the instructions are sparse.I have nothing to compare this unit to, having never had a road bike or a trainer until recently. I purchased both to enter my first triathlon next summer. I can get a good workout with this device and will try the included workout DVD, which seems to be a valuable add-on. The bulk of the noise I hear when using the unit comes from my bike, not the unit, so I would say it is quiet, but you will have to turn the TV up."
5,love it!,A little bit complicated to set up but AWESOME once you do. I've wanted one for a long time and have heard nothing but great things about it. I love mine. It's quiet and easy to use.
4,I want more!,"I like about half of these tracks, which makes this better than most cd's I've heard in the past few years. The rawness/energy is like that of early 80's hip hop/electro-funk or mid 80's bass. It definitely makes you want to move. I'm glad that I own it. Now I just need to find some more of this stuff. Several of the tracks have the same basic rhythm, similar to how multiple artists will release their own version of a dancehall reggae riddim. The overall sound is of bass beats starting and stopping, mixed with traditional(?) Brazilian drums, a little electronica here and there, and energetic raps/chants. Very nice mixture. One of the tracks sounds like a carnival song with drop bass."
4,Excellent summary of how to stay out of war,"Jerrold Packard tackles the uneviable task of having to sort out how five very different countries managed to stay neutral during World War II. Packard gives a country by country view in a concise chronology. Packard is not an appologist for any of these countries and in light of the controversy regarding Switzerland's role during the war it's very timely. Packard provides great insight into how precarious the situation was for all five countries in light of the presure from not only the Axis powers but the Allies. Packard touches on some of the complicity between Sweden, Switzerland and Spain with regard to the Germans but fails to delve in too deeply. It's a shame this was written before the Swiss controversy became more public, but in fairness that's a book in itself. The thumbnail sketches of the principals shows they were truly equals of Machiavelli and learned how to survive in precarious times."
2,Weird Smell from the New Ingredient Formula,I have been using this cream for the past 17 years because it has SPF and is unscented but Olay recently changed the ingredient formula and the cream now has a weird smell. I will look for a replacement brand now because the smell is not pleasant and is quite noticeable.
2,"Great Shows, Horrible Quality.","I recently found this two-pack in a bargain bin for five bucks, Being a Lucy fan I snatched it up and brought it home. Well all I can say is that I'm glad I only paid five bucks for it. On the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it's due, But on the down side the tranfer looks like it's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of Lucy. But the shows almost make this DVD a good value, bottom line! BUY IT FOR FIVE BUCKS. Any higher it's a bad value."
3,"LUCY, GOOD, DVD, BAD","The Lucy show DVD set was cheap. There were no official air dates of each episode, which would be good information for fans, and the episodes were not restored much, and, all of the episodes are out of order...like the first 4 are in color, and then theres one from the first 3 seasons, in black and white...I'd wait for a better edition DVD package unless you're a diehard fan, but, on the record, they picked some fairly good episodes for this 10 episode DVD 2 pack! The shower episode, Lucy takes vacation and new roommate episodes were great!"
4,Ok set for the money,Surface rust and strip easy but otherwise good for the price. Seller stood behind product and sent me replacements for the two stripped sockets (from metric and SAE sets I bought). Just treat them w/ care and spray some boesheild or other light oil to prevent surface rust.
3,Made for short people,Leg extensions require a leg inseam of less than 32 inches or your feet will drag the ground. Lat pull-down and preacher curl bench would have been easier to use if they had quick release vs. screw-in pins. Instructions for assembly were good up to the point of assembling the Lat Pull-down and Back Bench. Back bench brace hole does not align with quick-release pin hole. Cushions on leg extension keep coming of while using but are easily placed back on. Overall I got what I paid for.
5,Worth the money.,"I looked at a lot of benches on-line and in stores before buying this one. Very happy, this one is worth the money. Sturdy, I recomend it."
4,good for the money,"not a bad value for a little over $200. The lat tower is a great addition. Pretty easy to put together.cons - the foam rubber pads for leg extension are not good quality and i had to replace them with thicker ones I had . Also , the max weight for leg extension is 100 pds which is light for some lifters."
3,Opeths mediocre little brother,"Great effort from Agalloch and interesting layout as well. Cool pics of the band & great lettering. On the other hand, the lyrics seem rudimentary. Words like Fire, blood, birds, ice seem to be ubiquitous in the lyrics. This album is not the most challenging to the ear nor are the lyrics enough to fill one side of a sheet of paper. This isn't their best album & they lack the sophistication & complexity that Opeth possesses. Overall i would recommed Mantle from them, but this album i will keep in my collection. Cheers!"
5,"Dark, Ambient, Electronic Doom Metal","If the title above is what you're looking for, look no further.An obvious and natural progression from The Mantle, Agalloch redeems itself from those who doubted they could make yet another unique album. Agalloch has created an album with their same distinctive sound, but without regurgitating what already made it a popular Norse-sounding American metal band.It's metal nonetheless, but the repetitive bars of music give it an almost ambient, trance feel to it at times; a perfect complement to their ""lugubrious spirit."" Definitely an album that requires a listen from beginning to end (much like their others)."
2,"Magneatos Nice, but Weak - really cannot use for construction","We bought the set for our grandson for Christmas. We were impressed with quantity and quality of the parts - that met all expectations. But when you go to build something with it, the magnetic force is so weak that it just falls down - a real bummer and a disappointment. So you are limited to single dimension construction, flat on the carpet, and cannot go up even a single layer without real engineering skill to construct trusses to totally reinforce the structure. Even then, a slight touch brings everything down. And it seemed like such a neat idea...."
1,Very disappointed,I bought this toy for my 5 and 3 year olds. I thought it was a great educational and fun toy since my kids like building toys but unfortunately the magnetic strength is so weak that the slightest bump and the whole construct collapses. I'm very disappointed. I can't imagine how a company that makes a toy based on magnetic strength fails to make it strong enough to do what it claims. I feel like I've been tricked into giving my money away for nothing.
3,Lack of story,"While I imaginge this book is a very useful aid to scholars for quick reference, beware that the book does attempt to cover a little too much ground. By a reference aid I mean that all the myths are presented almost as synopses - Orpheus and the underworld, for example, was told in just a single paragraph."
4,:-),The book was in good condition no damage to the cover and haven't noticed any on the pages. Pretty happy with my purchase especially since it was so cheap!! :-)
3,A REFERENCE Guide to the Greek Myths,"This is indeed a complete book of all of the Greeks myths, however it is only a reference. This book has very little literary flair and should be used to refresh your memory of the myths as opposed to actually learning them. Most of the myths are reduced to basic facts and rarely extend beyond one or two pages."
4,A good reference book for the home library.,"The collection is quite useful as a reference. For example, if you want to find the text around a particular character in mythology, it will provide a very complete set of references and background notes. This is not the place to go if you would like to read the bigger stories as narrative.For each myth fragment, Graves structures his approach by:Recreating the primary mythCiting the sources he uses for the recreationAnnotating his view on the origins and/or meaning around the mythBe warned, Graves has his own ideas about history and the source of myth. Many people today can and do quarrel with these notions. It also is not always clear in his notes which bits are really well accepted by other scholars and which bits are his own interpretations.However, The Greek Myths is remarkable for its comprehensive scope and clearly useful as a source guide. Take it for what it is, and it proves its worth."
2,Could go either way,"This is not a book to read for fun. It is packed with interesting and useful pieces of information but it fails to present itself as an accessable work by its dense, uninteresting narrative style.An essential if Mythology is your 'thing', but this is not for faint of heart."
2,Not up to Thomas Perry's usual high standards,"Robert Mallon, in his forties and retired in affluence for ten years, is stolling along a beach near his home in Santa Barbara, California. He sees a young woman enter the water and not return. He proceeds to save her from drowning. In the few subsequent hours, they develope a relationship. However, the next day, Mallon hears of the young woman's death. He wonders what drove her to suicide and looks into her past. He hires a friend, PI Lydia Marks, to look into this stranger's death. They soon find themselves up against a network of assasins run by a paramilitary leader named Parrish. He inexplicably begins to hunt Mallon in a game to the death.DEAD AIM is one of the weakest novels written by Thomas Perry in years. The plot lacks any real basis in reality. Mallon is a less than inspirational hero which leads to a lack of reader empathy. Stereotypic characters abound in this predictable and silly tale."
3,Definitely sub-standard Perry,"I am a big Perry fan. I loved Butcher's Boy, Sleeping Dogs, the Jane Whitefield series, and Pursuit. I was not so crazy about Death Benefits. In fact, I can barely remember the plot.This one has to be the worst. The plot was too incredible, the hero was too boring, and there was no investigation to speak of by either the police or the hero. The most unbelievable thing was how kick-ass the hero was, even though Perry gave no rationale for why this was so."
3,Thomas Perry is Normally Great but...,"This is a decent book by a writer who has written a number of great thriller books such as Metzger's Dog, Butcher Boy etc and the Jane Whitfield series. Mr Perry at his best, is reminiscent of Ross Thomas but in this book he has fallen back to the pack a little. Nevertheless, I look forward to his next book eagerly."
4,Exciting,"The reviewers who said that this thriller is substandard for Perry are right. The book's villains are so inept that they reminded me of the Alec Guinness movie ""The Ladykillers."" Of course, this book lacks the humor of ''The Ladykillers."" Instead, the villains are strikingly ruthless. My recommendation is to try some of Perry's other books."
4,Dead AIM,"I love Thomas Perry, one of my favorite authors. This book is rather dark, which Perry has a tendency to be. However, it will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspence, and twists and turns in plot and characters. There is a surprise ending, as far as, some of the characters, and that furthers the mystery.In ways, the author shows what we are capable of doing as humans should the need arrive for survival, despite others unwillingness to help. I highly recommend."
3,"Perry, you can do better!","I love Thomas Perry's books. But this one leaves me baffled. What happened at the end, did you have someone else finish it for you? Alas, I'll always be a faithful reader. When is your next book due?"
3,Will Not Survive Library Use,"Review By Robert Young, Lane ESDwww.lane.k12.or.us/bookreviewWhy the West was Wild provides a fair amount of information about certain aspects of life in the Western United States from the mid to the late 1800s. The author focuses on law and order during this time period and provides information about different well-known criminals and officers of the law. Because this is a paperback book and not library bound, it will not survive many readings. This book is informative and provides some details which the young reader may not readily find in other books about the West in the late 1800s. Many of the pictures in the book are authentic and thus give the reader a real life view of the people during this era. I gave Why the West was Wild a three-star rating as it is a good book but it will not survive regular library use."
5,Recommended for school and community library collections,"Why The West Was Wild by Wayne Swanson is a combination history and picture book for intermediate level young readers who are eager to learn more about the tumultuous days of North America's history when thieves ran rampant, gamblers swindled at will, and heated disputes were often as not settled with bullets and the smell of gunsmoke. Black-and-white as well as color illustrations and photographs nicely bring to life this fascinating survey which devotes a two-page spread of basic information to a wide variety of topics including Old West Boomtowns, Cavalry, Range Wars, Indian Wars, and much more. A highly recommended title for school and community library collections, Why The West Was Wild is also available in soft-cover format."
4,Spy Killer,"As a fan of modern day murder mysteries and thrillers, I have become accustomed to the writings of James Patterson, Clive Cussler, Agatha Christie, and Stephen King. Imagine my surprise after reading a most unpredictable, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat pulp fiction account by no other than L. Ron Hubbard of ""Dianetics"" fame! The author delivers in this fine example of American Pulp Fiction, where there are twists and turns at every corner, and nothing is what it seems. The hero, Kurt Reid, takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride of an adventure, where he confronts danger, sinister forces, beautiful women, and even death. His journey is complicated by enemies from everywhere, and the beautiful but dangerous Varinka, a Russian vamp with questionable cohorts, and a secret agenda of her own. I recommend this book as a must read for anyone who longs for the suspense of a true spy thriller, where the plot twists several times, and the ending is anything but predictable."
3,"Quick read, quickly forgotten.","Kurt Reid is falsely accused of murder. In Shanghai he gets caught by the Chinese who coerce him into killing one of their political opponents. ""Spy Killer"" is another one of Hubbard's 1930s pulp adventures that will keep you entertained for the short time it takes to read it and be forgotten shortly afterwards. I enjoy these quick reads but I don't think they're worth the $10 list price."
2,Don't see the charm,"Perhaps I do not understand the charm behind pulp fiction but I found this story predictable and ultimately not very satisfying a read. As far as short stories go perhaps this was exciting for the times but it has not held up very well over the decades. I downloaded this story during one of Kindle's promotional periods when it was free, so I cannot complain; however, I now know not to pay for material written by L. Ron Hubbard."
3,Spy Killer,"We find the protagonist, Kurt Reid, reflecting over his past. He is at a nightclub watching a beautiful woman from across the way. He starts up a conversation. That is his first mistake. This could cost his life. Now he running around Japan trying to find someone to trust.I am not a big fan of pulp mystery but I figured this would be better then Hubbard's Science Fiction. It was and it wasn't. I found myself skimming a lot of description because it seemed like one page he was getting away from the girl or mob boss and the next chapter he wanted to find them. Every chapter was back and forth with such repetitiveness that I didn't really care what happens to any of them.Overall it is better than Hubbard's sci fi but not better then the fantasy."
1,miserable...,"this album makes me sick. matt pryor's cover of the afghan whigs' gorgeous ""When We Two Parted"" is disgraceful. this record couldn't be more predictable, pretentious, and annoying."
4,useful addition to any Tillich library,"A solid contribution from Paul Tillich. This is by no means his definitive work (see Systematic Theology for that). This is a far easier alternative to Systematic Theology, written more for the layman. It is really a curiosity piece for people who are passionate about Tillich, but not the type of book you can base your dissertation on, because it is a bit sparse. Also recommended: The Shaking of the Foundations, The Eternal Now, and The New Being, all by Paul Tillich."
2,Know your favorite titles,"Yes, they were The Superiors, but...where did those songs come from? The most popular recordings, Shoe Shoe Shine for example, were not on that CD. I couldn't remember the titles of the songs and bought the CD anyway. I didn't care for most of the recordings ...and all the way from Japan!!"
4,Good for the Beginner; Could Be Sturdier,"This is probably the cheapest and simplest DCC controller on the market. Serious modellers beware- it doesn't allow you to do anything fancy like modify CV values, it just lets you select locos and change their addresses. (There is a function key, sound-equipped locos.) However, for a beginner like me, it was very nice. The controls are fairly intuitive and easy to grasp (speed dial, forward/reverse and emergency stop). It even lets you run one DC loco, which is useful for me, although I understand that it's not reccomended. My only complaint is that it wore out after two years. I believe a wire connecting to the speed dial came loose. A more skilled modeller than I might have fixed it, but only ended up frying it.However, it's cheap and works well enough that I'm getting another one!"
3,"This book had a very good plot for a while, end not as good","It had a very interesting plot about two girls finding asachelfull of money, and deciding to hide it. One girl is rich andone is poor. The rich girl tells her boyfriend about the money. Then the poor girl is pushed down steps, had her brakes cut, and is almost hit with a shovel. So she kills the boy, to keep their secret safe and to defend herself. But then the ending is sort of disapointing, but for the most part is a fairly good book."
2,Not really cool,"That wasn't scary at all.I wouldn't appreciate that Sydney's best friend and boyfriend did that to her just because of some money.Plus those money wasn't real.The only one good thing about it was that Emma wanted to share the money with her mother,at least"
5,GREAT BOOK!!,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T READ IT YET SHOULD. THE ENDING IS SHOCKING AND FUNNY. IT'S MY SECOND FAVORITE BOOK BY R.L STINE. THE CONFESSION IS MY FAVORITE.
4,Would you kill to be rich?,"Emma Naylor and her best friend Sydney Shue have always shared their secrets with each other. Now, the two girls have a huge secret to share. They've found a bag of money with enough cash to make them the richest girls in Shadyside. They promise not to tell anyone, but Sydney can't resist telling her boyfriend, Jason. Emma's worried, though. She doesn't trust Jason. She's sure he'll do anything to get his hands on that money...even kill.I love this Fear Street book! This one will definitely stick with me for a long time. I barely manage to read books from cover to cover in one day, but I did it with this one. Anyway, there were a lot of creepy twists in this book. Especially in the end. The ending makes you go like: ""Whoa! I didn't see that coming!"" Although it's not the best Fear Street, it's still a pretty good one."
2,Confusing,"This was a confusing book. It starts when Emma Taylor (Poor pathetic girl we feel sorry for) and Sydney Shue (Rich girl we feel less sorry for) find 100,000$ in a dumpster. Emma wants all the money, so she makes Sydneys boy friend tell him about the money.Sydneys boy friend begans to act greedy, grabby, and acts like he wants to eliminate Emma. He then fakes his death, but he pretends to come back, for Sydney. Sydney, unable to take the stress, as a mental collapse.It turns out that Sydneys boy friend, and Emma were dateing secretly. She told him about the money, and they both knew that Sydney was rich, and didn't need the money. Emmas mom, who had an accident and had to leave her watress job to get an operation, needed it. The first thing they do is spend the money on them selves, but it turns out to be play money, so they sent Sydney to the nut house for nothing."
1,Nice plot and beggining but very disappointing ending,"This book was really interesting in the beggining. I thought I was really going to enjoy it. The end was really stupid and I've read lots of R.L. Stine books and this one really disappointed me. I like the books where someone actually dies and there are many suspects, like Broken Hearts, that is my favorite book and it's by R.L. Stine. Well I don't think you should read this because it's really just wasting your time. But if your in for a practical joke to make someone go nuts, go for it!"
5,I reccomend this book!,"This was an excellent book, and it was also a bit scary. Everything you could ask for in a book! From the cover, it dosen't look all that good from the front, but you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover! It was fantastic. You should definately read this book! Enjoy ""The Rich Girl""!"
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I REALLY didn't like this book. It is a typical R. L. Stine book (bad plot, bad story line, ect.). It is about this girl, Sydney, her best friend, and her boyfriend, Jason. They find alot of money and end up trying to make everyone else go nuts because they want it so badly. It has a TERRIBLE ""surprise"" ending. I do not wish the horror of reading it on anyone! DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. I, for one, do not want to repeat the experience."
4,Great for kids and teens,"The game was a very popular Christmas gift in our home. My 13 year old loves the movies and my 8 year old likes to play Monopoly! The only downside they said is that they wish the game pieces were the characters and not items like a cannon or a treasure chest. My kids collect different Monopoly games -- Lord of the Rings, Sponge Bob, Golf, etc. so this was a great addition to the collection."
4,Monopoly for Pirates,"I really enjoyed this version of Monopoly. The pirate theme really puts some zest into the traditional Monopoly. I would have made some better game tokens though, its difficult to determine what some tokens represent. I would have created ships for the tokens."
2,little pricey,"this would be an okay starter, if you don't know anything about 'explorer tools'but I'd have a hard time saying it's worth a whoppin' twenty dollars(!)worth of use for just one shopper..."
1,Just a DVD commercial for Ad-Aware.,"Basicly this is just and instructional video on how to use Ad-Aware spyware removal software. The software isn't that hard to use anyway, so why do a video on it? Click the check box to remove, wow, thats difficult.The production of the video is bad, (I think the host is also the camera man), it appears to be done with just a home camcorder.The ""so called"" spyware expert is just some tech shop guy. He does not go into any details on how to remove the spyware other than using Ad-Aware.And finally, ""End Spyware Forever"", hardly, Ad-Aware only knows about spyware thats already attacked systems. With new software coming out daily, (maybe hourly), it's only a matter of time before your system will get hit.A video on keeping your system updated, locking down your system, using firewalls, setting security zones, and not going to porn sites would be far more informative."
4,Handy picnic blanket for the trunk,"I really like the strap as i am lazy, just throw over your shoulder, go hike. Size is good, maybe sits 2 comfortably, 3 not so much. Quality is good, leather and such.I only major concern is the ability to clean this little bugger. Due the construction, leather handles and vinyl backing, I wouldn't throw in the washing machine. Maybe just don't be such a messy eater."
2,It's OK,The backing is a little flimsy and it rips easily. I don't think I would buy this one again.
4,This soap had a nice scent. It also ...,This soap had a nice scent. It also had a nice amount of lather that helped to scrub away the dirt and grime from under my fingernails. I also liked that it didn't irritate my skin like other cleansing products do. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.
4,"Even though the soap is """"unscented"""", it has ...","Even though the soap is """"unscented"""", it has a very light, feminine scent that I liked very much. I do not usually use a bath bar on my face because my facial skin is very sensitive, especially around my eyes. However, this soap did not dry out my skin at all. It rinsed well and did not leave a residue like many moisturizing soaps do. A very nice product that I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin."
2,I wasn't particularly impressed overall with the bar. ...,"I wasn't particularly impressed overall with the bar. I had to stop using it after two days, as it made my face extremely dry a minute or two after I'd rinsed and dried my face. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has dry skin to begin with, especially in the winter. For me, it'd be a summertime product. On the plus side, it was non-irritating, had a nice, not overpowering, scent, and it lathered really well. It rinsed off easily, and removed all makeup."
4,Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bath Bar works ...,Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bath Bar works for people who are allergic to soap.
4,"Overall, I think that this is a good ...","Overall, I think that this is a good product. It's gentle, moisturizing and has no fragrance (although I think a little bit of refreshing fragrance in the soap would be nice). It lathers well and cleans without stripping out natural oils. Since I don't have very dry skin, I would alternate this soap with one that gives me a """"squeaky-clean"""" feel."
5,Well made,This Wartenburg pinwheel is just as described and well made. It's the same quality my Ortho instructor has for class. Quick shipping and good price.
4,Fun toy,"Used it a couple times, a very simple toy to being a cool sensation to the one it is used on."
3,Not too shabby,"Shipped ridiculously fast but once it arrived, I noticed that a few of the teeth had been broken off. It ships in one of those yellow envelopes with bubble wrap in it."
4,Sounds emo but they aren't!,"An emo sounding name you say? You wrong (well I am anyway)!A great blend of new school hardcore and metalcore; hardcore & metalcore vocals, hardcore & metalcore music... a pleasent surprise, ""Above this Fire"" had been sitting there beside the monitor jeering me....'review me. i'm emo, just read me name', Sorry for doubting you guys!!Theres some great start stop music, fast bits, slow bits and full of energy.Loads of great backing vocals, and having said above they mix hardcore with metalcore, it is very much a hardcore CD, and a very nice debut. Hardcore Times"
4,Why don't scifi authors write like this anymore?,"This story is a classic, so I won't delve deeply into it (pun intended). What I liked about this version of the tale was the exquisite translation of Verne's text and the translator's commentary. Writing in Verne's day - the good stuff, that is - was so much richer than the diluted, profanity-filled fluff we see too often in modern fiction. How far we've descended (yes, that was intended too)!"
4,"If you read this book, beware","Apparently there are two versions of this book. I read one version and then read the excerpt on Amazon. Guess what, they are two different books! Yes, even the main characters names are different. So, Im assuming that one book is the real thing and the other is a fake. Why would someone do this? Your guess is as good as mine. So if you read any copy of this book, I would like you to be more aware than I was of the fact that it might be a fake.P.S. I do not mean to insult any publisher of the book"
4,easy fun read,First book to read on my Kindle and it was an easy and enjoyable read! The story is fun and creative.
3,Good,"Beginning was pretty long, took a while for the journey to start. Once the journey began it seemed to move along really fast. Climax was not what I expected."
3,Meh,"I have never been a huge fan of Jules Verne, but I decided to give him another shot and while I didn't hate ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" I wasn't overly impressed with it either. The stodgy professor character was interesting / entertaining, but the nephew/narrator was a whiney coward for the most part. The parts of the book where they were actually exploring were riveting, but the sections where they were sitting around waiting or rambling about evolution were tedious and the end was just too completely unbelievable. Meh."
5,This Gets Your Imagination Going,"There's nothing like a book that can get your imagination going. This is the kind of book that will do just that. Like Jules Vern's other books, this one will keep you spellbound. You've seen the movie, now read the story, which is always better than the movie itself."
5,aM ENJOYING THIS BOOK.,"Saw the movie with my son, then bought the book. I'm reading him a chapter every night and he's digging it. So am I."
3,Dry Storyline,Rather dry read and hard to get into but I didn't really know what I was getting into. Overall I found the story compelling but I think it could have been stated in fewer pages...
4,A great classic,I love reading the classics and having this great resource for inexpensive or free classics is wonderful. This is one of those excellent examples of early adventure literature that enthralled me in my youth and still serves to entertain.
4,Good Classic,I had seen the movie and but found the actual story even more interesting. Jules Verne had a wonderful imagination.
3,One of the classics,"Free book for Kindle. I look forward to reading this one. I have seen many movies based on this book, so I think I will enjoy it."
4,good for adult reading,"typical great classic. terminology is pretty tough for young student reading and they most likely would get discouraged with the 'big' and technical words. describing the stones, minerals, etc at the 'center of the earth' is fairly technical. purchased this, 20,000 leagues under the sea, huck finn. all wonderful classic stories. sturdy hardcover books well packaged."
3,The better translation is five stars. You may not be looking at the good version....,"The free Journey to the Center of the Earth ebook is a very poor translation with a main character named Harry. The plot is butchered and the narrative is a mess. If you would like to shell out a couple of dollars and get a very good translation and a much better read, you should look in to the Literary Classics Collection version (Journey to the Centre of the Earth - Full Version (Illustrated and Annotated) (Literary Classics Collection)) or the SF Classic edition (Journey to the Center of the Earth (Illustrated Collectors Edition) (Active Table of Contents) (New Translation) (53 Illustrations) (SF Classic)). Regardless, the main characters in the ""good"" translation should be Axel and professor Lidenbrock."
4,Another great classic,"In the age of instant gratification, this one is special. Preparing slowly the adventure, making sure every small detail was well thought off and well planned, taking the time to prepare the plot, the characters and the scenary, you won't find many books like this today.I gave it four stars, even though I think it rightly deserves five, because people, especially kids, will probably not have the patience to enjoy the slow pace this book unfolds. Pity."
4,Very good classic!,"I was very wary of reading this book...as I had never read it before. It was a well written creative classic. He really sinks you into the depths of the earth with the charactors. There were times I would hold my breath and then think wait...I'm not down there. lolHe had to think a lot to write this book and how it would really be to go down in the earth.There are three men who climb down a dormit volcano and start a journey to find the center of the earth. What they experience and see when down in the depths is only as amazing as the imagination. The ""giants"" and sea creatures, the world underneath. And then return to the surface of the earth, a truly amazing journey"
3,Not bad,Wonderfully written but a bit blah for today. Great in it's time. I am sure the younger kids will love it.
1,Didn't get what I was expecting! (how it was disc-rived),"The way it was"" presented"",I was expecting an original (illustrated) book!What I got, is a small comic book version!!"
3,JOURNEY review,"This was a good book. However, I did notice that the translator could not keep the name of the nephew consistent. In some chapters it was Henry, in most it was Harry."
3,"Exciting start and great premise, but falls short in the end","This book starts off strong with the Verne's classic style and wit. The initial pages are entertaining, fast-paced and set the stage for a potentially wonderful novel. However, the story quickly slows down as preparations for the trip take entirely too long. In the version I read, the actual journey doesn't begin until page 90. Then, once the journey begins, it is rather uneventful. Verne also puts in too much geological information for the average reader to appreciate. It becomes quite tedious reading the detailed content of various mineral deposits, composition of the substrata of the earth, etc. While some such material is interesting, Verne innundates the reader. While there were some exciting moments, this novel failed to win me over."
3,"i like gary lamb,s music","he,s got very moving music i would like to hear more of his demos but from what i see and hear it,s hard to get one of his albums thank,s for letting me hear him ."
3,another ghost sighting at Collinwood,"Burke Devlin suspects that the sheriff has overlooked important evidence at the site where Bill Malloy drowned. And Roger Collins is worried that the pen Victoria Winters found is just that piece of evidence.David Collins, accused by Victoria one time too many, lures her into the closed off section of Collinwood and locks her in. A mysterious figure draped in seaweed appears, tries to warn her, and disappears, leaving only wet seaweed behind..."
2,freestyle kings vol. II LIL FLIP',"I was surprised to hear that this mixtape cd was not as good as I thought it was going to be!I support lil' flip and all the underground artist from H-town to D-town...I like listening to screwed and chopped music and get throwed!!! But this album, did not satisfy me too well...i would recommend other albums other than this one,just because I think they just put this one out for fun and not really thinking about the fans.sorry...guys but i've heard better from the same rap artist....jr from D-town."
4,"Fascinating Content, but not a ""flashy"" DVD","If you like details about spaceflight, then you will probably enjoy this DVD, or at least enjoy parts of it. With lots of old footage, you can't expect it to be a flashy dvd that looks great on your five-thousand dollar plasma screen.The Challenger analysis is simply amazing. There is so much data revealed in this DVD that you can make your own judgement as to what the flight controllers could have or should have done. I think they had time to abort and knew there were problems many, many seconds before the accident. This DVD is worth purchasing for the Challenger stuff alone, in my opinion."
2,Easily forgettable,"There are a small handfull of songs on this cd which are worth listening to. However, the rest sound like different renditions of the same song. Unless you are making a mixed tape/cd for your girlfriend and want some really sentimential tracks, this cd is quite bland as a whole."
2,this book sucks,"I had to buy this book for a college course. Luckily, I found this one online for cheap. Be as it may that I rarely read the chapters, we used the 'self-quizes' in class, which are basically like mad-libs or coloring books. Very childish and very unhelpful. If your thinking ""hey I need some light reading material, maybe this book should work"", punch yourself in the face for thinking a leadership book would be a fun read and then find a different book."
3,"A very good Manon, but without a Manon","Pity about Sills, she tries hard, but she is far from being a great Manon. Pity also about Gedda and Bacquier, they deserved a better soprano. For all its good qualities, this set is far, very far indeed from the superb Victoria de los Angeles recording with Pierre Monteux conducting."
1,What?,"Just below Patricia's inane babble is the same old feminist insult to all historical women. When are feminists going to realize that they don't have to re-invent the wheel? Pick up a copy of Saint Teresa's Interior Castle. I think you will find her simplicity and honesty, without any hint of this silly pychobabble, both refreshing, and far, far more spiritually edifying.This book is a meandering account that draws no conclusions, but is quick to subtly provide it's rather limited, and dated, ideology."
4,The Seminal Story of a Soldier Known More as a Discoverer,"Though mostly know to people as the namesake of ""Pike's Peak"" he was also a soldier in the US Army for over twenty years (becoming a Brigadier General), dieing at the ""Battle of York"" during the 'War of 1812'.During his life he had three great accomplishments:1. Expedition to the Head of the Mississippi River2. Expedition to the source of the Red and Arkansas Rivers (where henamed the mountain he found ""Grande Peak""3. Capture of York (now Toronto) the capital of Upper CanadaHollon did a fine job of using correspondence between Pike and his family (though named Zebulon Montgomery Pike, he his family and friends referred to him as Montgomery) and those in the Army archives to give us a feel for Pike as a person. Unfortunately most of his journals and private papers where destroyed in a fire in the 1890s, but copies of his expedition journals were published and contain many of his thoughts.Zeb Kantrowitz"
2,Good Ideas That Don't Work,"I received this book as a gift. I can see why it was chosen: there are nice photographs and many interesting cookie recipes. I really could not wait to try them out. Unfortunately, a few recipes I tried did not work. The Valentine Sandwich Cookie recipe yieled a mousse-like batter that just melted in the oven and the Checkerboard Squares batter seemed to be going the same way. I added some flour to help them, but no amount of doctoring could save them. The Spritz cookies worked out really well. But it is hard to tell which recipes will work out."
4,Liked it!,"I really liked this book! I have most of Esther Brody's recipe books and love them. I think my fave recipe from this book is Dad's favourite chocolate chip cookie - really good. I don't think I've ever had a problem with the outcomes of the recipes but I haven't tried the cookies listed by the previous reviewer. Nice colour pictures of selected cookies and there are tips and helpful hints throughout this, as well as her other books. Easy to follow and there is a great index in the back. Good all around cookie recipe book!"
4,helpful if you need to choose a surgeon,"This book is helpful for picking a surgeon only. I find word of mouth to be helpful, too, but a little hard to get because of the delicate nature of the subject matter. If you're looking for any other advice, this is not the guide for you, however. It only helps you pick the surgeon. I had so many questions, and this book did not address any of them."
5,A great companion,"I bought this book, a workbook because I liked Dr. Kotler's prior book which a friend lent me and this new book did not disappointment. It is an excellent compliment to other books about cosmetic surgery which generally are more encyclopedic. This book is very focused on how "" to do"" the consultation and in that sense is unique and valuable. The niftiest part is how to cover a lot of ground on the phone before wasting time consulting with doctors who are a wrong match."
3,could help seeking a surgeon,"I found it to be helpful but a little confusing also. Hard to find cosmetic surgeon that would fit the doctors orders. Also, even if you get the book the leg work and interviewing is a long process."
3,Interesting at least,"Kevin Jones is spot-on in his review of this film, it is somewhat slow paced and the film transfer quality is slightly disappointing. Like many similar European films, the plot is abstract enough to be original, yet thin enough to be seen as no more than an excuse to link some exotic exploitation scenes together. The movie trades on the vision of its key scenes, most memorable including the woman chased through the field, the erotic use of champagne, the two way mirror and the couple who meet their fate in the torture chamber. The movie is well edited and acted and Howard Vernon pops up again as the mysterious butler. Overall the movie has a very voyeuristic feel about it, interesting to look at, but too slow paced to really draw anyone in to it."
1,Horrible and Boring,"To compare this to the work of Robbe-Grillet, as they do in the text, is really off the mark. What few parts there are of interest are few and far between, most is just dull and annoying, especially the music. It's not even that well shot, unlike Robbe-Grillet films which are for the most part EXTREMELY well thought out."
5,An Art Full Of Rich Imagination!,"Take some fragments of cloth, some silk, woollen and cotton thread, paints to be applied with a mouth-spray - and a touch of imagination. Art embroidery doesn't require a lot of equipment, but it's a form of self expression whose richness and variety will astonish you.This introduction by Liz Maidment provides the basic approach to an artform that is still undeservedly neglected. Look at the wealth of flowers, landscapes, buildings and garden scenes depicted in these pages and you will be amazed. All you have to do to share this creative adventure is to follow the author's simple instructions.Liz Maidment's description of her highly personal way of working includes all the necessary detail: choosing a subject, laying the groundwork, using the mouth spray, finding the right balance of colors and textures - everything is here. The text is backed up by illustrations of the different stitches used and by a series of projects explained and illustrated step by step."
4,Return To Form,"After releasing some mediocre records in the early to mid 90's Sonic Youth returned to Sonic brilliance with this 1998 release. Not quite as good as ""Sister"" or ""Daydream..."" but damn close and the amzing thing is that SY have the ability to release a great record 18-20years after their inception a feat that none of their peers have managed to pull off......get it now...."
4,A little too spacey...not for everybody to say the least,"As Sonic Youth has evolved they've went from extremly eclectic noise, to Sister and Daydream Nation's pseudo ""progressive"" vibes to Goo and Dirty's more mainstream sound and now they're starting to revert back to their older material...but in a different way.The punk edge the band had in the past is almost completly gone, in fact I wouldn't even call the bands last 2 LPs and SYR series ""music"" to me it's simply art. Sunday is the only song on here really, the rest just seem to be pictures converted into noise. Is this a bad thing? Certinly not, I'd rather have this than Disturbed. And from a few teasers of their new upcoming album, Murray Street, they seem to be reverting back to more song oriented structures again."
3,not one for the suicidal!!,"This is definately one of the wierdest least fun rock records I've listened to in a long while. Some of the tracks on the album dont really sound like proper records, but more like Sonic Youth have simply recorded themselves messing around with their instruments. Despite this Sunday is fantastic and at least its inventive. Shame most of the inventiveness doesnt work."
2,Fourth playback and still third rate.,"Bought on the strength of the promise of ""Sunday"", this self-indulgent pile of cack refuses to get any better, the craftmanship of the wandering guitars betrayed by the sad, sixth-form (that might be first grade over there) lyrics. I had hoped that a Thousand Leaves might grow on me, but a stalactite might grow sooner from the tip of my nose. Come to think of it, make that one star instead of two."
2,disappointed so far,"I've only listened to it once but I'll have to say that the songs seem a little tired and uninspired. Sometimes the vocal/guitar work sounds remarkably like that of songs on other recent albums, but with new words. I didn't ever buy the Washing Machine album, but I'm not one of those folks that only likes the older stuff. I thought GOO was good, liked Experimental Jet SEt... and found Dirty to be so-so. Of course the 80's albums were better...."
2,Sonic Youth loses their way,"I remember when this album came out. I had been a huge Sonic Youth fan for years and I ran to Mod Lang in Berkeley to buy it the day it was released. I brought it home, put it on, and desperately tried to like it. But I just couldn't. SY had always had a penchant for strectching out their feedback experiments into sprawling, fasinating compositions, but here it all just seemed to melt down into a pointless noise crusade. There are a few high points, but mostly I just find myself thinking, ""there is no way this song deserves to be nine minutes long."" The slide continued on the next record, but fortunately they got it together again on ""Murry Street"" and have been putting out great stuff ever since."
4,Silent Sonic,I just want to say that this album contains the beautiest song of all time. Track #7- Hits Of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)
5,Beautiful..........,"This album is simply beautiful and elegant! The lyrics are poetic, intelligent, and thought provoking. some of the songs on the album are so incredibly touching. Snare Girl is a delicate song whispered by Thurston Moore. The song brings me to tears everytime I listen to it because the lyrics are endearing and sweet. Effable Me and Female Mechanic..... are empowering feministic rants. All Sonic Youth fans should own A Thousand Leaves. I strongly suggest you purchase this, as soon as possible. I highly recommend Washing Machine also."
3,"Controversial if nothing else, apparently...","...but fortunately this album is more than controversial. Challenging from first to last, in this album Sonic Youth pushes the proverbial 'envelope' of both structure and melody in ways that their previous epic, _Washing Machine_, only hinted at. The most pleasant surprise here is the delicate beauty they weave into songs like ""Sunday"" and ""French Tickler"". Although the experiments here occasionally are grating or run a bit long, the fact that they're there, and the scope of their efforts, makes this ultimately a satisfying album."
4,"I love it, but realize it's not for everyone","I'm an SY fan who considers herself much more into catchy songs than guitar noise - although my idea of catchy is different from most non-SY fans - and I loved this album fairly quickly. Kim's vocals have continued in their jarring vein of recent years, and when I notice I've been listening to guitar squalling for over two minutes I switch songs, but even the songs with those unsettling qualities are repeaters for me. At first I warmed up to this CD for its similarity to Washing Machine, so if that's one of your favorites as it is mine, you may love this too."
4,Interesting Stuff,"This is the first time I`ve listened to this band. I`m really enjoying it, and will buy another one of their CD`s soon."
3,More rooted than scattered,"Even if on the indulgent side, ATL helps ease the melodically noisy group into maturity by featuring more Moore and less Gor."
3,An even mix of boring junk and really cool stuff.,"The only good songs on this album are the ones with Thurston Moore singing. These songs are very mellow for Sonic Youth but they are really cool and interesting. Kim Gordon needs to stop trying to be a free form poet and start making good songs again. There's only so much I can take of her yapping about nothing over some weird guitar sound. Lee Ranaldo just makes ok songs but some are just way too long for what they are. Overall, it's worth buying for the good songs but have your hand resting on the fast forward button because you'll need it."
3,three out of four is still pretty good,"I adore Sonic Youth but this album is dragged down by the weak Kim songs. Has she lost interest? She seems to have missed that the band is no longer a screeching punk act, whereas the masterful Thurston songs -- sunday, snare girl, and hits of sunshine in particular -- show the band, or most of it, continues to evolve. The Lee song karen koltrane is my favorite, and one of the deepest, prettiest, most layered SY songs ever.This is still one of the best recordings in the last three years -- three stars for SY is like 5-1/2 for anyone else -- but here the usual amalgam that makes up a Sonic Youth record is a bit chunky, with some unsavory bits."
4,"This Cd represents good Portland R&B, these guyz can sing.",I liked all the tracks the beats were bangin' and the lyrics were there to represent P-Town. This Cd iz worth buying if u like R&B.
2,"Too short, not too western","This was a disappointing read. The plot was a one-trick pony that rode around in an arena, not gettin' anywhere too fast and visiting the same scenery over and over. The Trailsman is shanghaied by a young woman into taking her purity so as to put off this mean, sadistic SOB who only likes his goods brand new. Anyway, it all becomes a three-ring circus of retaliation, and that's about it. Not much western in this. Not really much of anything at that. Only 165 pages. **Also, I'm startin to figure something out about this Trailsman. He's kind of one-dimensional. Not like a Longarm, who is smart, funny, and good-natured. Trailsman is just kind of straightforward and boring. Not sure I'm going to stick with this series."
4,A modern day prophecy,If you have ever doubted God's existence then this is the book for you. It is about a young girl who loses her mind and unborn child behind the walls of a cold and lonely mental hospital room. Vivid descriptions are given of the events that take place including her visions of the paranormal. The poetry is very prophetic and beautiful. It will touch the very core of your heart. A heart breaking but victorious story of her triumph over self-defeat and a cruel world. A must read for anyone who thinks they have reached the end of their road.
1,ewe,Not a good dvd.. You actually have to flip it over in the middle of the movie to watch the thing... let down
5,A life changing story,This is a very heart pounding film about true friendship. It makes you want to cry and leaves you extremely depressed. I sugget reading the book as well to give the movie more heart. The actors are all equally excellent and stay very true to who the characters are. The best film ever made.
5,A Fine Drama About True Friendship,"A lucid screenplay and a first-rate ensemble cast, combined with a powerful and sensitive musical score, make this movie a must-see. The performers were utterly convincing, and I especially thought that Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon gave Oscar-caliber performances. See this flick!"
2,What's the deal with 2 sides???,"I loved this movie in the theaters. When it was released on DVD, I scarfed it right up and popped it in my player. An hour and 15 minutes into the movie I find myself putting down my 40, getting off my comfortable couch and walking across the room to flip the damn disc. Hey Warner Bros., haven't you ever heard of dual layering???If I were you, I'd wait for the re-release. If it weren't for the flip maneuver, I'd have given the disc 4 stars."
2,What a Shame!,Fine acting and a fabulous cast. Intriguing story line and interesting plot. I would have given this movie a five if it hadn't been for the moron that laid down the sound track.You could not here the dialog without keeping the volume up then watch out for your ear drums. I SHOULD SUE THESE IDIOTS FOR NOT PUTTING A WARNING ON THE COVER! The sound effects and music kicking in between dialog was offensive it became so loud. What could have been an entertaining movie was ruined!
4,This story does not need to be told.......,"However, the film was great. Kevin Bacon is one of my all time favorite actors. I did not like him playing this roll. He is a very nasty person in this film.The story is well told. The film does an excellent job of creating the characters and telling their lives. The end is sudden and unexpected.It's definitely worth watching. But be ready for some unpleasant scenes. Be ready to see things that you don't want to know about."
5,If you can't do the time---don't do the crime,Sleepers was a very powerful movie---Kevin Bacon gives a breakout performance as sadistic guard Sean Nokes. I liked the first half of the film better; thinking about the horrors that the 4 boys had to have endured can keep you awake at night. Brad Renfro and Geoff Wigdor get high fives too; they had the New York accents down cold.
5,Exceptionally Real - Believable - True Classic Film Material,"Sleepers is incredibly real. As a young boy growing up in the juvenile justice system myself, I found this movie to be dead-on-accurate. I wish, and I know that others who view this movie will wish the same, that this movie is taken with great seriousness, as there is definitely a problem in our juvenile justice system. The problems are portrayed in this movie with great ease. The storyline is exceptionally believable. A great movie to watch over and over."
2,"new or used,that is the question","ordered ""sleepers"" dvd was supposed to be new.I got what appeared to be a used one instead.Dvd was not in sealed wrapper and had fingerprints all over disc when I opened it.Also when watching movie the volume kept changing and had to flip disc to wath last 20 mins of movie.It's not a record it's a 1.48 min movie.Pirated or used it was not what was advertised."
1,Yawn!,"Most people only write reviews of movies they really like. But for this movie, I disliked it so much, I felt the need to warn others before they decide what they want to rent.How do you make a movie about pedophilia boring? Ask Berry Levinson. Of course, if I'd have known he directed it, I wouldn't have rented it, because I've hated all his movies. All his movies have the following problems, including Sleepers:-Inappropriately happy 60's music blaring during most of the film.-Unbelievable ""pranks"" that make you doubt the story and the story teller.-Long boring scenes that go nowhere and don't seem to have a purpose.-People with obnoxiously fake New York accents.-All the women are merely objects or props for the ""cool"" males to play with.The only redeeming quality to this film was that Brad Renfro was in it."
4,"Enjoyable movie, but... enough with the ""true story"" line!","Yes, it's a good movie. Yes, ""Sleepers"" was a good book - BUT bear in mind it was promoted as a ""true story"" with but one thought in mind: to cause a controversy that would make it a bestseller. Now that everyone whose eyes, ears and brain are operational, knows that ""Sleepers"" is pure fiction, why does the movie studio still try to market the film as ""non fiction""? Watch ""Sleepers"", by all means, but remember that it's fantasy, not fact."
5,Sleepers,Awesome movie. Glad to own it. Very fast shipping and very reasonable cost wise. It is nice to find movies you cannot find in stores. I will definately be buying more!
4,Excellent Movie / Horrible DVD Pressing,"Sleepers is one of my all time favorite movies. There has been a great deal of controversy as to whether the story is really true or not, but it almost doesn't matter if you are watching the movie for its entertainment value.It is the story of a how a few friends conspire for justified revenge for their horrific mistreatment as children in a juvenile home. The ensemble cast is perfectly suited to their parts and De Niro and Pitt are standouts as their characters are the central pieces to the plan.I wish I could give separate reviews for the movie itself and the product. The movie is 5 stars. The older DVD pressing that I own is horrible, 2 stars at most. It is a two-sided DVD that you have to turn over in the middle of the film. Not sure if more recent pressings have corrected this. If I was purchasing this today, I would go for the Blu-Ray version as I would imagine that it contains the movie on a single side."
5,Stunning and captivating,"The cinematography and acting are just amazing! While the plot itself is a grim topic, the story line weaves in and out so smoothly."
3,Need to update product information,"The movie is good--but the DVD I received was a double sided DVD (half the movie is one one side, have to flip it to watch the other half of the movie). If I had known this I would not have purchased it. I'm not a fan of that format. I don't see anything in the product information about this format."
2,Political drama without characters,"If you liked the Shawshank Redemption, this is probably your kind of movie. Personally I hated both. There's no realism here, no characters. Everything in this movie is meant to underline the highly questionable message that society and justice is the main cause of crime, a message that also goes at the expense of good moviemaking."
4,Good Customer Service,"The 1st DVD I received did not work, and started to play somewhere in the middle of the movie. Also was not in the condition advertised. The seller immediately replaced it, and I was very satisfied with the replacement shipment."
2,poor,"This movie shows why movie stars do not deserve their big pay checks. This movie has three huge stars in it, and two lesser stars, and it was a total flop...and is a poor movie. The direction and the story are contrived and badly done. You can see every moment what emotion you are supposed to feel (""Oh, I'm supposed to be moved here, frightened here""). But you don't feel those emotions. It actually has the feel of a high school play, really, in its ineptness. And the fact that the guys you are rooting for murdered OTHERS, makes it a sour ending."
2,Read the book,"This movie was ok, but that's about it. Reading the book AND seeing the movie definitely makes it a better experience. But, still, I wouldn't go much above 2 stars, book or no book."
1,Last 30 min of movie is miising. Pirated junk,The last 30 min of the movie is missing. Do not shop from this vendor.
4,Sleepers,"Good movie. While the exact story is not true, or, we would have seen the real story on American Justice, can anyone say that the events never took place in some form in this world?"
2,Not Pleased,I really did not like that movie because Rizzo(Eugene Byrd) was killed for no reason. And he could have had more speaking parts. But I did like the close up shots of Mr. Byrd.
1,bottom of the barrel,"Like a particularly bad segment of the already-bad Dateline, this snoozefest proves that top talent and production values do not ANYTHING make. Scenes go on forever and the film is incredibly self conscious as to its time period. A mess."
1,Don't waste your money!,This is a big disappointment! Pictures are not all on one page. The animals are split in half because of this. What a dumb idea!! Save your money. This book isn't worth half of what I paid.
1,Not worth the free shipping,"A bunch of pictures about animals. No words...just pictures. No story, nothing. Is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Doesn't keep your attention for 5 minutes. A big waste of time. Save your money. That about sums it up."
3,Good introductory text,"""Fundamentals"" is right in the title. Covers AMLCD physics, technology and manufacturing in a very straightforward and easy to read text. It is useful if you are curious about how AMLCD's work, but does not have enough depth for serious study."
2,Great Book,I bought this for my son in law for his birthday. He was happy to get it and is planning to make some rods soon.
4,Catastrophic...(sorry),3 insensitive boys have killed a cat.But they'll soon regret it.They don't know that it still has plenty of its' 9 lives left.
3,"Not bad, but ...","I think this book is well written, but it has a lot in common with 'Cry Of The Cat' which was one of Stine's 'Goosebumps 2000' series, only that one is toned down a bit for younger readers. The plot is pretty much the same."
3,It Was O.K.,"Stine has done so much better than this book. To me it didn't follow a story very well. It did have it's good points but, I feel Stine could have definetly done better."
1,Bad Book,"This book might as well have been from th Goosebumps series. It was very stupid and had no plot, it was obvious too..."
5,An Awsome Book,It was a neat book.It's about a cat that was killed by a kid then cats everywhere try to kill him but the thing you don't know is there is one mastermind behid it all.The master mind is... read the book and find out
4,This book was ok not the best fear street book but ok,This book was about a boy how hatted cats. there was a cat in the jym how folowed him around. when he (acsidently )killed the cat his frinds strted dieing of scrach marcks. well I wont ruin the end for you but I will tell you that its suprising.
3,A PROFILE IN COURAGE,"Watching this rather pedestrian remake of Hitchcock's classic film is somewhat sad but uplifting. Christopher Reeve displayed a tremendous amount of courage in playing a role so shadowing his real life. Knowing that the late actor had to go through so many of the therapeutic remedies and the horrifying life of paraplegia makes his performance more emotional. As for the plot itself, it's formulaic and the ending is not a very satisfying one. But Reeve is impressive and he gets some decent support from Darryl Hannah, Ritchie Colter and Robert Forster. It's not as suspenseful as the original but is a testament to Reeve's endurance and determination."
1,It's cool that Chris Reeve was in it but...,it just didn't have the chemistry of the Alfred Hitchcock version.
1,Chris is really cool,"But this movie just wasn't for him and i don't think rear window could possibly be made without Kelly, Stuwart and of course...Hitchcock!"
1,christopher reeve is realy cool but....,REar window isn't the movie for him. this just isn't a cool movie.
1,It can not touch the original,This movie is an insult to Alfred Hitchcock. Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. Chrstopher Reeve cannot hold a candle to James Stewart.
1,"Bring back James Stewart and Grace Kelly, please!!!","I hated this movie! I'm not bashing Christopher Reeve, but he couldn't ever top Jimmy Stewart. Alfred Hitchcock would roll over in his grave if he saw this remake. They changed the story way too much. I hated their new ending. Don't mess with perfection! I could hardly stand watching this movie, because it is so incredibly bad compared the the original! Grace Kelly and James Stewart are magnificent!!!! Christopher Reeve just doesn't cut it. Instead of making this, they should have come out with a new edition of Rear Window, which is very hard to find nowadays. My final word is that Christopher Reeve may be Superman but he is anything but super compared to James Stewart!"
2,Bring Back James Stewart PLEASE!,I don't want to bad mouth Christopher Reeve or anything but I miss the old one with James Stewart. I have been looking for that for over two years. It dissapeared off the shevles without a word why. Would someone please explain this to me? Anyway I thought Christopher Reeve did a good job but they changed the story line way too much and didn't really give an explantion of what happend. Bring Back James Stewart PLEASE!
2,Don't try to remake classic classics,"In my search to find a copy of the original, I came across some information which stated that the original is being remastered and should be available for release end of 1999 or beginning of 2000.....I have it on my Christmas list!"
1,Why? Why? Why?,"Why is it so hard to find? Older movies than this one are abailable! And this new version is not good. And I am NOT tring to insult Reeve though, i think he is a wonderful actor but no one will get a suspense/mistery picture as Hitchcock. He is, after almost 20 years of his death, The Master of Suspense. And no one will get such a frightful feeling as James Stewart, and no one to get the charm of Grace Kelly, not even Daryl. This is what makes the ORIGINAL Rear Window as unique as it is today, and as it was in 1954."
1,A horrible remake of Hitchcock's classic,It's about time that people wised up to the fact that remakes very rarely work. Shame on everyone involved with this one. The first half hour is a documentary about how awful Christopher Reeve's life is now. The other half is a very poor atempt at remaking the old Hitchcock movie. The acting is terrible as is the script. This movie shouldn't have been made. If you want to see a good movie watch the old one. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
2,Okay but will never be able to top 1954 Rear Window!,I like that Chris Reeve was in it but the movie is very poor in it otherwise. I don't like the chemistry between Hannah and Reeve all they seem interested in the end of the movie is sex. That is not what it should be based on. I don't like the actors or the acting except Chris Reeve's. I personally was desapointed.
1,why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why,"why did they re-make this movie.why did they put daral hannah in this film as grace kelly's role.why. what was the point of re-making a perfectly wonderful film.but please just remember this is my opinion so....you people out there who liked this film, it's fine. this is my opinion and my opinon only."
1,You expected more?,"I'm sorry, but why do people remake classics? Why? To try and make the new one better than the classic? That's impossible. I don't know why people thought that they could remake Rear Window, I mean for one thing it stared Jimmy Stuwart (irreplacable) and Grace Kelly (a beautiful women!) and for goodness sakes it was directed by Hitchcock! Why would anyone think that they could go up against a Hitchcock film? I don't understand it. But hey just forget this one, see the 1954 version."
3,What?! There&#65533;s no video for the original?!,"I haven't seen this movie, so I gave it a somewhat neutral rating. But I'm shocked Amazon doesn't offer the original. WTF?! That's a movie I would like to buy, too.As for this remake, I don't know, it seems almost like an excuse to make a movie with Chris Reeve. I hope that doesn't sound harsh or anything, but that's how it strikes me."
1,Bad Movie,"This was a horrid trashing of one of the greatest films from one of the most brilliant directors in film history. Christopher Reeves was never a good actor, and just because he has been through tremendous personal struggles (which is commendable in its own right), it does not mean that he can act now. A movie like this makes the moviegoer ask one simple question, ""Why?"""
1,"A Great Movie, you have to bee kidding!",It does not even get a star. It is the worst remake of a movie. I am using the term REMAKE loosely. Don't waste your money on this trash. Stick to the originals if you want to see a great movie.
1,I really resepct reeve but this just drives me up the wall.,"i can't stand remakes...esspecially Hitchcock ones cuz no one will EVER be able to have that chemistry and flame that Hitchcock had. This was a good try but please, enough with the remakes such as: A Perfect Murder, Rear Window and dare i even say Psycho?"
1,"I'll tell you one thing, it isn't Brilliant","Rear Window is a remake of the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock thriller starring James Stuart and HSH the Princess Grace of Monaco. I respect Christopher Reeves, and I support his every move in trying to return to an acting career, but this movie just won't cut it. Alfred Hitchcock's movie was a clasic, and when we see one movie, we expect the book, remake, etc. to be distinctly like it, and this is not at all what you would expect. I'll tell you one thing, it isn't brilliant."
4,"Not the original, but still great","If you're looking for a remake of the original, then you will be disappointed. However, if you're looking for a good movie, then you've found it. This is a great film. It's not Stewart/Kelly/Hitchcock - but then again, who could ever touch that version?"
4,Superman at his best!,"It was definately a dream come true to see Christopher Reeve perform again on the screen! Being a fan of his since the Superman movies, I so excited to watch this movie! I found it very heart-warming and touching a story about Jason Kemp who is a qudriplegic! Reeve invested most of his experiences into this role which was indeed very tailor-made for him, and the result is good chemistry between him and Hannah! I could understand why many did not like this movie because it wasn't like the original, but since I've never seen the original, I really couln't passjudgement! I guess for me, the real thrill was to see Superman still prove that he is our hero evfen through his determination to walk again! A must for die-hard Reeve fans!"
3,cool sophomore album,"Jenifer won in the French American Idol spinoff and she has an incredible voice and it is evident in her albums. This second one has some nice songs like ""Le souvenir de ce jour"" and ""Comme un yoyo,"" and most if not all of the songs are pop enough for one to get used to. Unfortunately, she still sounds like she's aiming for a mainstream audience. This album features Kyo and Tina Arena, supposedly, but I've had the album for several months (bought it in France) and I can't point out which songs those artists appear in. I still prefer her debut album over this one, (""Jenifer"") but over-all, not a bad buy."
5,Keep em coming..,"Album points received/max = 56/60 = A12 trax: 5x12 = 60.60/5 = 12, 12 stars = 1 letter grade.56 stars, A, The French Girl you always wanted..Breakdown:Ma Revolution *****5Le Souvenir de Ce Jour *****5C'est de L'or *****5Ose *****5Pour Toi ****4J'en Ai Assez *****5Come Un Yo Yo *****5Le Passage *****5Celle Que Tu Vois *****5Serre-Moi ****4Chou Boup ****4De Vous A Moi ****4End thoughts: Not as good as her first CD, nor better than her new album. Still overall a pretty good CD here, begins to faultier off towards the end and losses points because of it."
5,Hanson r Awesome!,I think these talented boys are the best. This interview CDis a must if you are a huge hanson fan like myself. They are awesome boys and this CD is really cool.
4,Right Guard Sport,I use right guard unscented aerosol for convenience. Its the onlyaniperspirant that works well for me. I have used it for years.
2,Not what it use to be,"I've used Right Guard Unscented for years and loved it. The product shown was not what shipped. It's not really the sellers fault, it's Right Guard. What shipped was the ""New"" unscented. It's called unscented, but it's certainly NOT unscented."
1,A total piece of garbage.,"Only gets one star because the review won't go through unless I give a star.THIS ITEM IS SIMPLY PUT... NOT UNSCENTED ANYMORE.The old unscented product was awesome. No scent and stopped the stink.Don't be fooled by the pic. The new ""unscented"" STINKS something awful.Just a damn disgrace how they discontinued this product. Just made absolutely no sense..."
3,Please sell through Amazon so I can get FREE Shipping,Wish you all would allow Amazon to fulfill this item. Seems kind of stupid to pay almost $8 for S/H on a product your only charging $4 for. Why would anyone buy this from you online when you can buy it for that or less in the regular stores.
4,Recommend this!,Fun romantic movie! Watched with wife for the first time and we had a great time watching it together. Lighthearted without baggage.
2,Good story,Love this story and the acting is exceptional. The amount of swearing is unnecessary though. Didn't finish this movie because of that.
2,The one thing I really liked about this ...,"The one thing I really liked about this product is that it went on very dry for a product that's a liquid anti-perspirant. I often forgot to shake the bottle before applying it. Unfortunately, it was poorly effective as an anti-perspirant if it wasn't well shaken."
4,Dry Idea Roll-On Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant has some ...,"Dry Idea Roll-On Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant has some significant features. The large roll-on head operates smoothly and efficiently, distributing product quickly and evenly. The deodorant dries with amazing quickness and has a pleasing baby-powder scent. It proved effective in its dual antiperspirant/deodorant role by keeping me dry through a number of demanding tasks."
3,Very Small Book,She has a lot of good ideas but I was very disappointed in the size of the book for the price. It is the fastest book I have ever read. You could thumb through it at the bookstore and get all you need out it without buying it!
4,"Succinct, an easy read, a bit elementary","Wood has a few good pointers here. However, if you have a good deal of common sense and you've been on eBay for a while, you'll come to the same conclusions. She did bring to light a few ideas about where to find stuff to sell; there again, nothing ground-breaking. This is a great book if you are afraid of testing the waters, and you want to feel better about your venture. I would have liked to hear the author's take on how she sells on eBay: her approach, how she determines where to start the opening bid, tips on how to make listings successful, and her eBay ID would be good to know to compare techniques. In other words, I wanted more nitty-gritty."

5,One of the Best,"Simply put, one of my favorite books. A true master of the word and especially the short story. His style is so compelling and easy to read, and his depiction of the country and its inhabitants is haunting. In my opnion, he's right up there with Steinbeck, and he blows Hemingway away! Thank goodness we'll always have his work!"
5,Amazing,"This CD player is absolutely amazing. Every aspect is outstanding! I tested the ESPX and nothing made it skip, the headphones are comfortable, good sound, and a good price. The most amazing part was the 2 level bass boost. I'm a fan of bass and with the 2 level bass boost on, it blew me away. Good job RCA!"
5,A terrific book,"I have read thos book over and over. I love the story, the hisotrical perspective and the characters."
4,Madselin by Norah Lofts,"The seller is pretty good: the book arrived quickly, but was not quite in the condition which the seller described; but that's OK. Norah Lofts is a good writer of historical fiction and Madselin is a good read. Highly recommended especially for those who want to give a gift of a romance novel without the nearly pornographic content of most of today's in such genre."
2,Sexual Exploration/Exploitation,"I have decided that I just don't like the works of John Updike. Though he's a whiz with language and knows a lot about theology and philosophy, his ideas about masculinity, sex, love and need are abhorrent to me. He places women in a role where their only option is to 'ascend' to man's carnal desire, to become victims of the human plight which we are all heir to.This story is set in a parish and deals with a minister who becomes defrocked because of promiscuous behavior with his parishioners. Updike appears to idolize adultery and the need for sexual exploration/exploitation at the expense of sensitivity growth and responsibility."
3,"Hard read, but it's good for you","He is a hard writer to read. His prose is thick and dense, and it doesn't flow all that well. I found myself re-reading paragraphs again and again. The subject matter is interesting; the reverend has lost his faith (did he ever had faith?), and has also lost his morals. He tries to justify his actions in 200-odd pages in a brillian way. Although i felt disgusted by this character (he's a swine), i admire the author.This was not an enjoyable read. It demanded too much attention from my brain. But i am glad i read something by Updike, and i'll be ready for more in maybe 10 years (long recovery period)."
2,Doesn't stick for very long,"My chief complaint is that this doesn't stick for very long. The suction is so poor that my 5 month old had no problem knocking it over with one blow. The toy is cute and he did have fun playing with it on occassion when it was not stuck to his high-chair tray. However, if you are using it for your high-chair don't bother as your baby will easily get this off and thrown on the floor."
3,Doesn't stick,The item kept my baby's interest from 6-8 months. It also didn't stick to the high chair for very long.
1,Not Safe!,"My son loved this toy until his finger became stuck between the rocking horse and the purple side that holds the horse. I'm only glad that I was right next to him to help. If he had panicked, he could have easily broken his finger or dislocated it. This toy should be recalled & Sassy should take reviewing the safety of their toys a bit more seriously. I know that I will be thinking twice before trusting their toys again."
2,Every known heist cliche - thank God Cynthia Geary's acting.,"The Heist was your typical big holdup caper movie; you have your gang of well-dresssed, well-armed bad guys (explosives man, safe cracker, electrician, sexy killer girl, psycho guy and McCarthy, the leader who might fall for the pretty employee); you have your high tech, your dumb guards, and of course, lots of dead employees and cops. You might rewind after 15 minutes if it weren't for Cynthia Geary's performance. A pathetically lean script (McCarthy says about 100 words in the whole caper) guarantees lots of overacting. This movie is hard to take seriously, but with popcorn and bad weather you can make it to the credits - well worth it for the great closing soundtrack song."
4,Good inexpensive printer,"This is a very inexpensive printer that doesn't include a black ink cartridge nor a USB cable. The color cartridge has a pretty short life as well, maybe 100-150 pages.I was apprehensive about such an inexpensive printer. I've been plesently surprised. The print quality is very good, photos are good as well. Compared to my old HP712C, this printer is at least as quiet, much faster, and better quality print. I don't agree with the other review saying its noisy. Most printers don't include connecting cables. The Canon another reviewer recommended doesn't include a USB cable either."
1,Junk,"If you're considering this product, consider it no further, it is absolute bollocks. It always jams and the catriges cost almost as much as the printer does. Get a lazer printer and get a good one."
1,Bad printer,Why would anyone sell a printer that does not come with black color cartridge? I have to spend an extra $20 for black color cartridge. Do NOT fall into this trap.
3,Good printer for Home Use,"It's a good printer for $40! I only use mine at home and maybe print 5-10 pics a month and a few pages of tab's and I've had NO problems!Now it does go through you ink cartiridges faster than most HP deskjet's I've ever owned, but since I dont print that much it doesn't bother me!Also it does print SLOW, but just like when burning DVD's the SLOWER the BETTER!!So Basically, This is a good printer for home use!Hope this helps!"
5,Valuable Tools for Experienced Advisors,"This is an excellent successor to Jeff's earlier book on getting started in financial planning. There is great material, but because every reader has a substantially different background, a lot of it is not immediately applicable. But the critical issue is that SOME of the very well organized checklists and tools will be precisely what the reader needs, and needs now. Some of the Bible will be very useful later. The firm-wide self-assessment survey is a great tool, as is the model business plan."
5,High Quality,"Even though an aerosol can is a little large and I don't travel with it, I rather like the spray on Right Guard. Frankly it seems the best of all the deodorants I've used and keeps me smelling pretty fresh all day, even on a hot summer day when I'm outdoors a lot. I prefer this band to most others."
5,This book explains the beautitudes and the conclusion of it,"To tell the truth I am only read this book half way through. This book is so fascinating, in each chapter it explains about the beautitudes, depth explanation, and conclusion. Mr. Graham writes in a logical and spiritual combine, which helps the reader to understand better. . WOW!! I would recommend you to buy this book"
3,"Literally, breathtaking","Madonna has certainly improved with age! Her alto voice, and her choice of recordings within the past few years, have both drastically improved to the point where I've willingly bought both this single and her recording of Evita. The original song is thumping and exhillarating - the remixes are interesting, although they do not, in my opinion, touch the original. The final remix is particularly singular for its operatic overtones. An excellent song for this crazy, rushing world - a ray of hopeful light through the swirling madness."
3,A great song with annoying as hell remixes,"Dont get me wrong, because the original song on this cd is excellent. Its one of my favorite Madonna songs. But, it did have one faulty...the remixes. The last remix was very good, but the second and third tracks (both remixes) weren't what i thougth they'd be, especially after listening to the excellent Frozen remixes. Please dont assume this is a bad single by reading this thought, as logn as you dont like the same beat being played over and over and over again. By the way, 3 stars is pretty good for a single."
3,not enough content,only 4 tracks including an album version? come on! There were at least 2 other remixes that they could have included on here (that WERE included on the vinyl release. the vinyl had a total of 8 tracks!)the tracklist SHOULD have been:1 album version2 sasha ultra violet mix3 william orbit liquid mix4 calderone club mix5 sasha twilo mix6 sasha stripped down mix7 william orbit ultra violet mixand maybe even 8. has to be (non-album track)
3,"it's unfortunate, but...","I must second what the previous reviewer says. I purchased this item just last week and discovered the same exact flaw precisely where he describes it. It's a shame, since these symphonies were in dire need a new release on cd. I give the disk 3 stars because the recording is otherwise truly stellar. Nevertheless, this problem needs to be fixed post-haste.I exchanged it for its magnificent sister release, Symphonies 93-98, and have yet to find a problem there."
3,Sym 104 defect report,"The defect in Symphony #104 described by others affects the copy I received from Amazon in May 2008, but interestingly the disc plays OK in my OPPO 970HD, while it hangs at the reported spot in the Pioneer drive in my Mac G-5."
1,Error in Remastering,"I was so excited when I purchased this double CD and so amazed at the performances. I heard about Beecham conducting Haydn's London symphonies until I got to the last symphony in these recordings. To be exact, in the middle of the last movement of symphony 104 the CD skips and hangs something furious. I played it on my CD component player, my computer, my DVD player, and finally my walkman with the same result, skipping and hanging at the same point of the CD. Hoping that it was just a lemon CD I returned the CD for another only to find it had the same error at the same point of the recording. However, after close inspection under the right light, I was able to see a smudge/ripple on the outside edge of the CD. I sure hope it was just a bad batch because I'd really like to have an error free recording of these symphonies. If these errors were not present I would have rated this double CD a perfect ""5 stars."""
3,Beecham? Just not sure.....,"No doubts about the music but Beechams performances I find overrated. He is the universal (esp for Anglophiles) beloved conductor. He doesn't float my boat.The style of Beecham's performances is now quite dated. The way music from the baroque and classical eras is now played has changed enormously over the years. Modern stringed instruments play about a third louder than the old gut stringed instruments and completely obliterate the subtle woodwind parts which in the case of Haydn and especially Mozart contain some of the best of the music. The performances by John Eliot Gardiner and Malcolm Bilson of the Mozart piano concerti on original instruments illustrates this perfectly, the piano is part of the orchestra and not dominating the performance."
4,Good product for kids.,This bowling ball has a very nice color and feel to it. I took it to the local bowling alley to have the holes drilled for my daughter and she loved it. She was always complaining about using the bowling balls at the alley and I wanted to get an affordable bowling ball that was of good quality but would not break the bank. This is certainly worth the money.
1,Dumb Game,My fiance and i bought this to spice up our love life. It was a sex trivia game basically not anything engaging or exciting.
2,Um... not really,"On this CD, as always, Perlman's playing is near-flawless and Previn's orchestra is powerful and precise. So I don't really know what went wrong. It sounds as though both artists are trying to make the music TOO Romantic; sure, Mendelssohn was a Romantic composer, but he was still Mendelssohn. He was lyrical, but he never ""gushed,"" as is the case here. It also seems as if Perlman and the orchestra are never quite together, which is hardly noticeable but disturbing nonetheless. I really wish Ruggiero Ricci's recording of these concertos with the LSO was still available; now that's quality. As it is, Isaac Stern's recordings of these concertos (while they must be purchased separately) are better overall, I think."
2,I really didn't care for it at all.,One you've had Albert's Hot Sauce it's hard to find a good one and this one wasn't hot enough for me. I also bought the queso and threw it out after a few people tried and we all thought it was horrific.
2,"You expect a reliable product from ZoneAlarm, don't you?","ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite was once a good product before version 7. However, with the new version came unexplained crashes of important modules so that the computer was apparently left unprotected. A subsequent update to version 7.0.362 left the computer so slow as to be unusable. The ""Instant Support"" option at the ZoneAlarm website instructs users to turn off the ""on-access"" scanning to solve the problem with sluggishness, but this makes the computer vulnerable to malware.Also, some installations of this version of ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite seem to suffer frequent corruption of the spyware database, and solving this problem requires following a series of tedious steps. All this troubleshooting can take up hours of your time. You may want to enjoy your weekend, but ZoneAlarm will have you uninstalling and reinstalling instead."
1,Very unhappy with new version,"We have been using ZoneAlarm happily for several years, but the latest version (7 I think) takes over the CPU for long periods of time, making the computer unusably slow. Very disappointing."
1,look elsewhere,"I went to Zone Alarm because I was unhappy with another product. That was a big mistake. I run VER 8 it has caused loss of internet connectivity. This is very similar to the problem that occured in July when they put out an update that conflicted with a MS XP update. I lost many hours on that fiasco. This tim it didn't take me as long to try turning ZA off. Sure enough after turning ZA off I was able to connect. I run ZA on two computers one still has Ver 7 , no connection proble with this one. The one updated to VER 8 is the one that wouldn't connect.A second issue is I am constantly bothered with warnings about suspicious program activity. ZA says that it doesn't know what to do about this but yet I am supposed to. I bought the program to do this for me.What a piece of junk.At least the other vendor would talk to me and did finally offer me a free upgrade. Unfortunately I had already bought ZA by that time. What a mistake."
1,AWFUL TERRIBLE WORTHLESS DANGEROUS!!!,"DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! Foolishly, I didn't listen to the other reviewers on this site. Nothing but problems. The first thing ZoneAlarm did to my computer when I tried to install it was give me the Blue Screen of Death and crash my notebook computer. I rebooted and ZoneAlarm crashed it again. So I rebooted in Safe Mode, uninstalled ZoneAlarm, deleted the folder, and rebooted again. Problem solved. Then I snapped the disk in half. I wasn't even going to ask for a refund or try any of the workarounds - downloading updates, installing in safe mode, etcetera. I'll just buy something else. If I could give this product -negative five stars, I would. This is a terrible, awful, dangerous software product. Maybe they'll fix the problem in a later version, but right now ZoneAlarm is not ready for Vista. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! STAY AWAY!!! I hope this review helps you."
2,Constant Update,There really is in my opinion the only thing that I liked above other security software is the email checking.On the negative side the software is constantly updating itself which on my PC slowed it down or stopped other use. When doing a virus check with only 25G in use it would completely stop all other use for over an hour (I could play solitare if I didn't change games).
1,My laptop will never be the same,"Yikes, I had read some great reviews on this product and as it was time to renew McAfee I figured go with a higher reviewed product. Bad idea. I don't know if deleting McAfee screwed up my laptop or if Zone Alarm is just poorly written, but I had nothing but problems. And to make sure they drove me nuts their Tech department doesn't speak to the customer they send random emails...how's 24+ hours strike you for response time. Stick with your current internet security suite, Zone Alarm may work for you, but then again it may not..but happily, and kind of oddly, their customer service department moves QUICKLY when asking for a refund."
5,great software! get version 7.0.408.000 or above !,"I've been using this great software since it was just a tiny little firewall. through the years, they have held their own against the giants and still came out ahead. they have changed their partners for the better in most cases and when they have problems. they do fix it.As with all the other reviewers below. I have encountered all of the aforementioned problems. it sure does get frustrating. but thanks to one of the reviewers below. what he said is true. after downloading version 7.0.408.000, so far all the problems I had vanished. it just vanished. the processor slowdowns, the outlook express taking forever, the slow browsing. gone! zip! nada! Yes, I do have to do a few more tests to do but so far, I'm very happy with the latest version. As i said. they do fix their stuff.So to everyone who has problems. seek out the version 7.0.408.000 or above and upgrade. you'll all be much happier."
5,Slow bootup problem solved,"I don't often write reviews, but the negative reviews on this program are so disturbing that I wanted to share one positive experience here.I use it on two four-year-old Dell computers, neither of which is very fast, and it performs very nicely. It has a non-intrusive, streamlined interface, does what it's supposed to, and the price is right.The slow bootup problem existed in an earlier version and (as other reviewers have pointed out) is solved in version 7.0.408.000.Frankly, I don't understand the negattive reviews at all."
1,Shut's down computer,"I am running Windows Vista Home Premium. Every time I try to install Zonealarm Internet Security Suite, it shuts down my computer. The only way I got the program to install was in safe mode. But, after restarting the computer it would immediately shut down once zone alarm began to run. I liked the previous versions, but this one is a big disappointment. I am now trying the trial version ofKaspersky Internet Security 6.0Internet Security Suite. So far no problems and it appears to have awesome protection features that work very well."
1,zone alarm - DO NOT BUY,I would give this a ZERO RATING if possible. NOT COMPATIBLE with Spyware Doctor (A totally excellent program!). ZONE ALARM customer service is below terrible. Never had these problems with NORTON INTERNET SECURITY. Also - Zone Alarm Customer Service said there were OTHER SERIOUS problems with Zone Alarm 8.
1,Good Product Now Gone Bad,"ZoneAlarm used to be an outstanding product now it's just horrible. Boot/shutdown times can hit the 7-10 minute range if you have certain other software installed on your computer. What other software - every day software like Nero Burning ROM and a variety of others.Spend some time searching the ZoneAlarm user forums reading about the boot/shutdown issues and will find that many other applications you may already have on your computer don't sit well with ZoneAlarm causing ZA to be extremely slow.Normal every day software causes ZoneAlarm to be slow? Doesn't sound right but it's not a joke. This formerly great product is now completely down the tubes. The ZoneAlarm forum moderators post their canned responses to this issue and Tech Support recommends you uninstall the offending normal every day software or make registry tweaks to improve performance.Bottom line: ZoneAlarm is no longer a good product. Choose something else like Kaspersky, Norton, or McAfee."
1,"Zone Alarm; Once a great program, now not so good.","Having used Zone Alarm since it was owned by a small company in San Francisco over 4 years ago I have seen the product decrease in it's ability to function severely over the years. Apparently ever since an Israeli corporation took over things started to change. Even for free I would run, not walk away from Zone Alarm ! I switched to Kapersky. Hope my input helps"
1,Not for Windows Vista!!,I had this on my Windows Vista Ultimate and it makes everything slow on my dual core processor. Not only this it made my computer not able too connect to the internet! DO NOT USE Zone Alarm for Windows Vista at all!There are other Free Programs much better than Zone Alarm. I Use AVG 8.0 now and its Much better!
1,Another crappy bloatware product.,"I just want to reinforce what other people are saying about ZA being a resource hog. YES, IT IS A RESOURCE HOG. I just installed it on my mom's Dell P4 (XP), and the computer instantaneously went from having a 20-second startup to having a 5-minute start-up. Everything has slowed down. My God. It's not worth it. Why do they feel they can release software this bad? It's obscene."
2,Performance and Upgrade Headache,"Based on reviews and recommendations, I tried ZoneAlarm for the last two years. Upgrades have almost always had problems. These are well documented in the ZoneAlarm forums. They seem to push out updates, sometimes automatically, before they are well tested. Specifically, I've had to continually workaround a known conflict with the Cisco VPN software that I use. The performance for the ZoneAlarm software has gotten increasingly worse. I have since switched to the latest Norton Internet Security 2009, which appears to be a HUGE performance improvement. The system now boots in under a minute instead of 3-4 minutes."
2,"Not renewing, simply not worth the frustration.","I see I'm not alone in my frustration with this product. I bought ZASS after seeing that it scored highly in several 'reputable' publications and websites(which I'll now take with a hefty grain of salt from now on). Seemed like a good deal until I installed it. The constant warnings and alerts were annoying but expected. What wasn't expected is the way ZASS totally takes over my pc on startup. I have to wait anywhere from 1 minute to over 5 minutes for ZASS to finish loading up, initializing, scanning...whatever it is. Even after the initial startup I experience lock ups lasting a minute or so. A minute might sound like a minor annoyance but when you're on the internet or running a program having your pc lock up a half dozen times over a period of a couple of hours it becomes more than a 'minor' problem. For a supposed finished, non-beta product that you paid for it's inexcusable. No renewal from me."
4,Kissing In A Very Different Way......,"...In the way of necrophilia, that is. As perverse as it may sound this film is not in any way gratuitous or done purely to shock. It deals with the subject matter in a tasteful, sensitive and intense way and although it by no means justifies necrophilia it does offer us an insight into one of the reasons why it is done and leads us to have some sort of understanding and sympathy for the necrophile presented in this film.The reason why I am not giving it five stars is because I did not really like the style in which it was shot; dark, slow and very very gloomy all throughout. But then how else are you to make a film which deals with such a morbid and tabooed topic?"
5,A must have for fans of film noir,"This is a very beautifully made film about some really wild subject matter, necrophilia. But don't let the strange subject matter keep you away from seeing it. It is tastefully done with a lot of stunning imagery. I loved every second of it, even though necrophilia has always seemed rather disgusting to me."
1,just something me and the guys kind of noticed.,The main character (female) has sex with dead people (not to mention the film has no female nudity) and it is shown to look beautiful and full of purpose and etc. every one of the lead male characters are portrayed as extremely wierd and gross and etc for there own idiosyncrasies. the films depiction of all the male characters might lead one to think the director has serious issues with men that aside it could have been good.
2,It takes a very open-minded person to enjoy this film.,The plot deals with a young girl who gets a job in a funeral home just so that she can do her thing with dead bodies. I was concerned with where the film was going. The idea that she enjoyed something like that made me curious as to how the film would end. It is hard not to pay attention to a film like this.
5,adams ansel examples,"Inspiring, fascinating, revealing. Ansel Adams writes ""the storybehind the pictures"", the why, the how. Not necessarily or always the""technical"" details, but certainly the ""artistic"" inspiration.The reproductions of his photos are good, although having just hadthe pleasure of seeing the actual photos in Washington DC, theysimply cannot convey the complete splendor and impact of the originals.Well worth reading!"
4,Excellent for the intuitive side,"The photograhy technology in this book is really really old-school stuff. I'm sure it was pertainent to the day it was written, however there is no digital discussion a'tall. However I found the value in this nice volume is Mr.Adam's discussion of the intuition needed to take a great photograph."
5,Go behind the scenes with a master,"I found this book very revealing and compelling, not to mention inspiring. You get to go on a journey with a master of photography and learn about how he approached each of these 40 classic Images, as he discusses in detail what the day and shooting conditions were like, what equipment he used and why, how he framed the pictures and why, and lots of other interesting things that come to his mind. Whether or not you are a fan of Adams images, you will gain something from this book. Adams is a teacher, and his love of sharing his acquired knowledge with the reader comes through in this very enjoyable resource."
4,"Not exactly accurate, but good pictures and rhythm","First off, technically, the story slightly diverges from the original Japanese story... mostly to preserve rhyme in the translation. Overall, very happy with this book and the rest of the series (Kodansha Bilingual). My son (who is part Japanese) enjoys hearing stories different than the same old Grimm tales, and it also teaches him a little Japanese folklore."
3,Great for content,"Pros: Great for content and getting players excited about the setting, Made for 3.5eCons: Lots of spoilers for the novels (They don't ruin the story but lessen some of the drama if you haven't read them since you know how they are going to end.), poorly organized (in contrast to the FRCS), and no full-size world map (unlike the FRCS, but a full size map can be downloaded from the publisher's website)Overall, I really think it could have been a lot better if it was done by game designers and not the author of the novels."
1,Alkan made bland,"Smith worshippers will damn me for bringing this up, but Smith's first (1968) recording of the first movement of the Concerto was abridged with cuts of Smith's own invention. At least that is rectified here--the 1977 version is complete. However, whatever virtues this collection might possess, for me they are nullified by Smith's merely adequate performances. In the simpler pieces, he's OK, but in the horrendously difficult Concerto and Symphony, Smith seems to have his hands so full merely playing the notes, that ""interpretation"" is beside the point. Perhaps Smith's Alkan appeals to those who find Alkan too sinister, threatening and bizarre--but that's precisely what makes him interesting--Smith manages to make him bland. Get this set only if you want the other pieces in the collection, but get someone else's Symphony (Lewenthal or Hamelin) and Concerto (preferably Hamelin-who leaves Smith behind in the dust both technically and interpretively)."
5,A Great Remastering!,"I own the original LP recordings of some of these works and the CD version. In a previous review I remarked how the CD sound quality was not the best, but adequate.This remastering brings back much of the original vitality and great sound quality that was in the LP version but lacking in the CD version. And all at a bargain price too!All Alkan (and Ronald Smith fans),don't hesitate to get this 2CD set. To have the symphony for piano and concerto in such fine quality sound again is a real treat for the ears.Most highly recommended!"
1,Master of Glen Crannach,I ordered Master of Glen Crannach by Linda Howard. I received Master of Glen Crannach by Stephanie Howard.
5,Great Product,This is such a great product. These were so great in the beginning when your milk is first coming in. I could not live without these. You just pop them in the microwave for a minute or two and apply them. They are also great if you deal with issues like mastitis or plugged ducts. I think that they can also be used as mini heating pads which I have also done. I highly recommend these.
3,not for large-breasted women,"I love the idea of this product, but it didn't work for me.Pre-pregnancy I was a 32F and my breasts grew from there. When my breasts became engorged after birth I tried pumping to relieve the discomfort. The warmth of these tubes helped but it took 2 of these to cover one breast. My husband had to hold the tubes on my breast while I pumped which was very ackward. I also had to remicrowave them a few times each times I pumped because the warmth didn't last long enough (2-3 times each side). There was no way these were fitting inside a bra for me, they required hands to hold them in place which meant I couldn't do anything else if I was using these."
2,Not good for cooling the boobies,Pros:Fits very VERY comfortably inside braWorks well when heated to soften engorged boobs... But be Careful not to overheat... Just a few seconds too long in the microwave can cause burnsCON:Stays cold for only a minute if that. When my boobs were hot and itchy and engorged I just wanted icy cold relief and these tubes could NOT provide that relief!! The cool softness would last a few seconds on impact but in a minute or two my boobs would WARM UP the tubes! Even if the tubes had been in the freezer all day!!
4,Very useful for engorgement,"This is so easy to use and the way it's constructed, safe for your skin as when you do hot compresses (before feeds) it won't burn your skin, and after feeds when you do cold compress, it isn't freezingly so. My only complaint is that sometimes the beads accumulate in certain areas so there are sections that are 'beadless' ie those sections then can't transmit heat or cold."
3,Good But Not Great,"I was so excited to get this item after HOT nipples (needed the cold tubes) and slow let-down (needed the warm tubes). I was disappointed that the coil wasn't attached and could be unwound. In addition, they are loosely packed with the filler. Both of these facts made the tubes seem flimsy and a little difficult to manipulate when bare-breasted; they'd slide off. For these reasons, I don't feel the tubes were worth the money I spent on them.On the other hand, the fabric is soft and I like using them more than the rice sock I made in prenatal classes.Just my two cents..."
4,Not so great for big boobs,"I had terrible issues with my flow rate. Using these helped a lot. Simply warm them up, and wrap them around your breast. These tubes do not fit larger breasts very well. I am only able to focus the warmth near the nipple area. This works well for me, but may not work so well for others. You also have the option of using both tubes on one breast. They are a great price, and really useful. If you plan to breast feed put these on your registry. I gave the product 4 stars because it is really helpful, despite my large breasts, and also nice as a simple heating pad. I used it on my neck after giving birth to loosen my muscles a bit."
3,Not really tubes,"I really wanted to like these, but the design doesn't work for me. By calling them ""booby tubes"" I thought that they would actually be tube-like and stay on without having to hold them. Alas, when I received them they were more C-shaped than tube-shaped, and there was no way to fasten them (and they seemed a little small). So when I tried to use them while pumping things were sliding all over the place!I do have to say that the material used is quite soft. I popped them into the microwave for 40 seconds and they stayed warm for about 6 minutes. I would have loved them if only I could have fastened them somehow."
4,Feels good,I ordered these tubes to help reduce breastfeeding pain. They felt so good when heated. Almost instant relief. I haven't tried them cold yet.
5,A great product!,"This product really helps with let down of full breasts and helps with the production of milk. I love how easy it is to pop into the microwave and place on your breasts. It smells a little funny, since its natural flax. I already told other friends about this and think that its a good to have for breast feeding moms. So glad I stumbled upon it on amazon and decided to try it!"
3,Meh...I would return if I could,"These are overpriced for what they are. They don't stay warm for very long and are incredibly clumsy to use. They don't fit in my pumping bra without interfering with the flanges and they fall on my sons face when I'm nursing him. If I kept the packaging I would have returned them. Right now they're sitting on top of my microwave for me to not use. Maybe I'll find a use for them in the future, but for pumping and breastfeeding they're useless to me."
4,"Haven't needed them yet...,","I got these as part of my registry and thankfully, I haven't needed them up to this point (my son is 10 months).I have been warned that once the weaning process begins, mastitis is more common and I will keep them until I stop nursing, J-I-C! I love everything else from Earth Mama Angel Baby that I have tried so no reason I wouldn't like this product too!"
4,Fantastic and very useful,I needed these to assist me in unplugging my ducts and they were very helpful!Warmed them in the microwave for 45 sec or so and wrapped them around my breast with the nursing bra keeping them in place.Loved the natural smell and have purchased teas from EMAB and would continue to do so
5,Get these for mastitis!,"Nursing moms, you might want to have a pair of these on hand in case you get mastitis or a clogged duct. They are perfect and wrap around you - with or without a bra. You can use them cold or hot. They are amazing!"
4,Good,"The CD player is great and it has yet to skip, but my major complaint are the headphones. They are so small that I dont see how any male could wear these. They are the perfect size for my 2 year old. Other than that, it is a great buy."
3,OK product,"This riser block has three levels that you can put your front tire in. The highest level makes the bike about level when sitting in my Cycleops Fluid 2 trainer, so the other two level are useless for long rides in the trainer because you are facing down in the front with too much pressure going on your arms, wrists and shoulders.Before I used this riser, I used a automobile ramp that was for driving my car onto to change the oil. This ramp offered much more variation in angles for the bike but would not hold the wheel snug as this riser does. This riser is also portable, as the automobile ramp is not.Ok product, just wish it was constructed to raise the front wheel farther than it does."
3,basic,Upon receiving this product I was slightly disapointed to find that the levels on all 3 rivots are the same (or really really slight difference). It works thought
1,Not The Pictured Item,"You will not receive the pictured item that is no longer available but will receive the newer, larger, stackable climbing block. Probably will not matter to you - it did to me because I'm a triker and wanted to match an existing block for my third wheel. BikeSomewhere refunded the purchase price but I was still out the shipping. If you want a climbing block order the one listed through Amazon that has free shipping."
3,CycleOps,"The riser block is solidly built, but does not offer much difference in heights/positions between locations. When I select the lowest (deepest) channel the bike is still above paralell in front."
3,Lowest Height Not Low Enough,The lowest height option is a little higher than my Computrainer holds my bike; so I'm using one of the cheaper single-height units.
1,Pathetic,"I ordered the Ascent Adjustable Magnetic Trainer and the Cyclops Riser block simultaneously. Not only did I receive the flywheel of the magnetic trainer in shattered pieces, but I've yet to receive the Cyclops Riser. Numerous emails have yielded nothing but the same song and dance...It's on backorder. Order was placed 45 days ago.Businesses like these should stay away from the prestigious avenue that Amazon affords. Amazon should only allow itself to sponsor Front Running businesses and not sponsor ""less than serious"" merchants."
3,not-quite-classic tales,"A collection of nineteen occult stories by famous authors (Kipling, Hawthorne, Doyle, Saki) arranged into four categories (Secret Societies and Cults, Witchcraft and Magic, Spiritualism, Prophecy). While the stories are generally of high quality, some may-- inevitably-- already be familiar to readers of classic horror (James' ""Casting the Runes""), some are a bit dated, and a few don't represent the best works of their authors (O'Henry's ""Pheobe""). The arranging of the stories into the four categories is a bit awkward, also. Worth a look for those interested in early horror."
1,Pointless and boring,"Wasted money on this boring book about a boring subjet and quickly offloaded it at a used book store. Save your money, don't but this book."
1,Yet Another Celebrity Tribute Book,"Another of many insipid self-promos, ""The Sweater Book"" includes hundreds of photographs of B-level celebs mugging for the camera. ""The Sweater Book"" is little more than coffee-table pap, brimming with self-indulgent rhetoric and imagery, while lacking in material substance. The recurring theme (a single sweater draped over the subject being photographed) makes a trite and heartbreaking display of the lengths washed-up stars will go to in order to get their face back into the public domain. The quality of poses range from a droll tolerance to a sad, (almost<i>Sunset Boulevard</i>-esque) rapaciousness for attention on behalf of antediluvian former-entities.""The Sweater Book"" is a mawkish monument best left to be forgotten. Instead of misguidedly purchasing this book (of which a portion of the proceeds go to AIDS organizations), donate the monies directly to a charity. It will ultimately be more satisfying."
5,Thanks,"When we read this book we were carried away to the ends of the earth. When we finished it, we said it could be done. Its a year later and our family has taken sone sailing lessons. This summer we are chartering a boat in the Carribean. By next summer we will own our own boat. For our family, the adventure began with this book. How can we thank you?"
5,An author with extreme passion!,I received the 'Northern Magic' for Christmas and I managed to met Diane Stuemer this past winter at the Toronto Boat Show ... I even got the book autographed. Her book was an excellent armchair sailor read but she definitely has the gift in public speaking. I also recently found out that she died of cancer .... I must admit that I did shed a tear or two when I heard that.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I found the title of this book should have been reversed, ""A Family Odyssey:The Voyage of the Northern Magic"" because the author deals more with the trials and tribulations of family life. To be sure, the story is fantastic, but the way it is presented may not appeal to the tastes of all readers. I would classify this book as ""motivational non-fiction"" not ""adventure travel"". It dealt well with the emotional trials of the trip but I found it was over-dramatized and didn't fulfill my expectations."

1,broken into half after using twice,"i was boiling the beef for my baby's solid food and it was the 3rd time i was using it after purchase. with a loud noise, the pot was broken into half making total mess. the gas was on medium power too.obviously this is not one of the sturdy Le Creuset Stoneware. this is very light and not reliable.i took a picture of the mess and try to find a way to put it up.i didnt have a chance to return it as the baby has been handful and very unhappy with this purchase."
3,Incorrect Tech Data / Questionable quality,"In addition to NOT being stovetop safe, as pointed out by a previous reviewer, the tech data also indicates country of origin: France. Mine was marked: Made in Tialand. It clearly is not up to the standards of my French produced pieces - main complaint is the poorly fitting lid - the top litterally skitters around on a 1/2"" gap (horizontally) between the top and bottom lips - a very poor fit/tolerance. There are also several blemishes in the stoneware transalting into either dimples (innies) or pimples (outies) in the glaze finish - basically caused by impurities in the slurry mixture or poorly handled molds. Although none of this will impact the intended function of this baker / casserole, when one pays the big price for Le Creuset, one expects top notch form AND function. If all I expect is function I can drop a few bucks for Pyrex."
2,Lid NOT tight - not top quality.,"This is to second another review here. This item, while beautiful, is not up to the usual Le Creuset standards (and I own 8 or 9 other Le Creuset pieces, with which I am quite happy). The lid on this casserole is loose, and however arranged, is never even close to a snug fit. If I hadn't thrown away the box, I would return it."
3,it cracked,"i received cherry cassorole with lid twicw and then it had shatter marks all through it,very poor workmanship and very disapointed.you have to send back to factory and pay postage.amazon should stand behind there products."
3,"Very heavy, color different than pic, and made in Thailand","If you're like me you expect Le Creuset items to be made in France as they have been in the past. Not this one - bottom says made in Thailand. The color on the lid of this pot is very different from what Amazon is showing - it is a much lighter red, almost like Kool-Aid red - yucky IMO. And finally, the casserole is VERY heavy. Which means when it is full of food it will be SUPER heavy and hard to lift out of the oven. Although it feels like a pretty good piece of crockery, I just can't recommend it for the above reasons."
1,No Show,"Although the order clearly indicated the product selected, I received a 1 and 1/2 quart dish instead of the 2 quart. A waste of time since we already have 2 smaller casserole dishes. We wanted a larger, 2 quart dish. I returned the item as instructed and have not heard anything since. Thought they might ask if I still wanted the 2 quart, but maybe it was out of stock. Went to a local store and bought the one we wanted."
4,"Great buy, not the best packaging.","These condoms are probably one of the best I've ever tried. Very cheap too. Although the packaging wasn't that great, which is why it lacked one star."
5,Great children's t.v.,"Watch it with your kids or grandkids and have a great time. And Wishbone, you're so cute. Who's so cute? You are. Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are."
5,Just how I remembered it!,Paw Prints of Thieves is the story of Robin Hood while Hot Diggety Dawg is Journey to the center of the earth. The quality of the DVD's isn't that great on my 60-inch HD tv (a little fuzzy) but definitely not awful and very watchable. I wish they would release the other episodes on DVD as well! I love Wishbone and it was fantastic to hear the theme song once more and regress back into my childhood!
3,not hard cover,"Although this was the correct book, i was informed that it would be hard cover, not paper back. I love the story of Ferdinand the Bull. I was tickled to get it at such a low price. My Labrador Retriever sits under my nectarine tree sniffing the air...just as Ferdinand does by the cork tree. Thank you, Jenny"
3,Disturbing,"Although I find the character of Ferdinand endearing and worth emulating, I have mixed feelings about this story because it glosses over the otherwise horrific, inhumane sport of bullfighting. It bothers me while reading this to a child because, as an adult, I am well aware that the usual outcome of bull fights or even the display of passive, noncooperation posed by Ferdinand is not at all pleasant. In other words, in real life poor Ferdinand would never have made it back home alive!It is also contradictory for readers to express so much sentiment for a bull when in real life, bulls and cows are tortured in factory farms and brutally killed on a daily basis; they are treated just like objects instead of anything worth loving. On the other hand, connecting with Ferdinand may somehow or other raise sensitivity and affection toward them."
3,I prefer the Disney book,"I ordered this for my kids some years ago. I was disappointed because I thought it would be a book version of Disney's Ferdinand the Bull in full color. I had such a book as a kid, and never forgot the pictures. I have since been able to resurrect the original cartoon on tape."
1,Shocking and inappropriate for young children,"Upon reading this book, I found it to be very shocking and inappropriate for young children. My students thought it to be a ""bad story."" They ""did not like it because the men wanted to hurt Ferdinand. They wanted to keep sticking him with spears and a sword."" My students asked me to stop reading the story because they felt very sad."
4,a classic,My aunt gave me this book for my first birthday. I probably started getting interested in it around 3 years old. I remember that I adored the gentleness of Ferdinand. He just liked to live quietly and peacefully. Being violent and competitive just didn't interest him. I encourage all parents to buy this book for their small children. It is a great bedtime story.
4,Bees!,"Ferdinand, a nice bull, has a run in with a bee. A tiny little bee... with a BIG sting! When Ferdinand gets stung, he acts the way we all envision bulls acting. Everyone thinks he could fight in the ring, but he is happiest smelling flowers.As a person who hates bees, and certainly did as a young boy, I can understand the reaction Ferdinand has. Youch!As much as I love the book, it does leave off the horrid reality about bullfighting, how bulls are tortured and killed. As a kids' book, maybe it shouldn't, but hopefully, children get fooled into thinking bullfighting is just a game. Hence, my rating is only four stars.Read it to your child, and explain what bullfighting it. At the very least, Ferdinand makes it clear he'd rather play in a meadow."
3,Bull Fighting?,"I ordered this book when I purchased ""Ping"" because it was rated 0 to 4 year olds. Stupid of me but I just read it to my two year old without first reviewing it. The description of bull fighting shocked me. I questions whether this book should be rated for 2 year olds. My child liked that Ferdinand smelled flowers but he was confused about sticking sharp objects in the bulls."
3,Cute,"I remembered this book from when I was younger. It arrived and I read it to my daughter and realized I didn't remember it being so boring. The drawings are poor in the book. The story line talks about how the bulls are harmed. I don't think I will be reading this to my daughter, I think it will get donated to the used book store."
5,Love this book!,SUch a great old favorite. Bought this for my niece who just turned one. It may be a little young for this book but in six months she will love it.
5,Wonderful story and lesson in life,I bought this book for my grandson. I wanted him to know it is okay to stop and smell the flowers and peace is the only way to go.
5,Ferdinand Returns in all his glory,This book was well used and well loved by three generations of my family. Now it is my grandson's favorite and the read along feature is a big plus since he loves to hear it again and again and yet again.The Story is charming and has a great message for all ages.
5,EL TORO,"A BOOK FROM MY LONG AGO CHILDHOOD, RECENTLY REUNITED. THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS PRESENT OF A DEAR FRIEND'S GRANDDAUGHTER. WHILE SPANISH IS SPOKEN AT HOME, ENGLISH IS READ TO THE LITTLE ONE, AND THIS IS A WONDERFUL STORY TO BE READ AND TO READ."
5,Ferdinand the bull,"Introduced my Grandson to this very old and wonderful story.. Purchased through Amazon, arrived quickly and in perfect condition. My GSon could not be happier Thanks Amazon Rich Dangler"
5,ferdinand,"I was glad to find this book. I had it when I was a little kid and now that my grandkids are learning to read, I want them to read this book too. It's just like the one I used to have."
5,A great contribution to civilization,This is one of the greatest children's books ever written in English. The late great Munro Leaf should be given the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously.
4,Ferdinand,I will remember this book because he didn't figth.Ferdinands trait is nice because he didn't hurt anyone.
5,love this story,"I ordered this book for a friend and read it myself first. I had only seen the disney cartoon before. The story was the same, and even some of the drawings were similar to the cartoon. The only thing some may not like is that it is black and white, but I think that adds some artistic value to the images. After reading the book I think disney did a great job turning it into a cartoon that stays close to the book."
5,"A Taste of Spain, A Touch of Humanity","So, I had this and read it to my children a thousand times. Then I spent six months in Andalucia, Spain and discovered this book is an accurate representation of it. The illustrations actually appear to be Spain from Madrid to Andalucia, especially the Frontera, including Ronda and Vejer de la Frontera or Arcos de la Frontera.On top of that, the story of Ferdinand is about being who you are, and being at peace with yourself - whether it conforms to society's expectations or not. Subtly, and well, done.Beautiful pictures, beautiful story, peaceful theme. What more can you ask, whether you are an innocent child or a world-weary adult?Worth buying and sharing with someone you love."
5,"It's ""HIP"" to be square...........","or in other words, your own wonderful, individual, YOU! Ferdinand the Bull, the peaceful bovine, who's content with just smelling the flowers under Spain's cork trees (doing his ""own thing""), in spite of the pressure of his peers to be a ferocious fighting bull......is an inspiring way to share with your children how great it is to be DIFFERENT. That you can be anything you want in life and not to let anyone tell you otherwise. This was my favorite book as a child, it inspired me creatively and I've lived by it's simple message: BE who you ARE."
5,great brakes,"put on my 2005 nissian fronteir ..i live in mountain country with allot of hills and turns these brakes are great ...i had quite a bit noise with the break-in but only for a couple hundred miles..they are worth the money, and when i change my front brakes i will also use ebc."
3,What About The Rest Of The Remixes.....?,What about the Soul Solution & 95 North remixes?..Those were the best ones.....Get Jody's new CD too...Photographs is Killer!!
1,Bad acting ... worse story,"It's stuff like this that gives science fiction a bad name. No wonder there isn't more of it.Of course the acting and the story aren't the only things lacking. The special effects also suck and the action sequences are badly coreographed.Basically, it's just a bunch of people pretending to shoot each other and beat each other up, with none of the advantages of a good movie."
2,Slow moving Sci-fi/Martial arts action,Its not the worst movie in the world.Oliver Gruner acting is one of his best to date as he dosen't say much.....thankfully.Its a good buy for Martial arts fans but Sci-fi fans are left expecting more.
2,Mars,"Nice action for Olivier, decent plot but lacks a good script, and Olivier's voice for some strange reason, does not sound at all like him."
1,Mars,This is the most wasted time movies in my life of 30+ yrs. Buy this video now and regret forever!
1,Does Nothing,This product was aweful. I thought it would do more then just say one thing. Not what I expected. Surprise surprise for Amazon.
5,A Feast for the Eyes,"Most of us use wrapping paper and some of us are old enough to recall ""wrapping"" in the 60's. This marvelous book brings back memories for we baby boomers and will delight the younger generation. A valuable compilation of the decade's design movements by a great designer and illustrator Kevin Akers."
5,Love it!,This book is full of colorful images from the 60's. Who knew wrapping paper could produce such a fantastic book? It will make you think twice about tossing the wrapping paper after opening your next gift!
5,Frog Gummies,I LOVE MY FROG GUMMY CANDY...I even shared it with the grand kids (even though I DON'T normally share with anyone).
2,"cute to look at, terrible to eat","While these were so cute to look at, when I tasted them and had other people give them a try, the overwhelming response was YUK."
4,great price -- great taste,great value and haven't gone bad after sitting in a sealed jar for over a month.great snack and are fine in a ziplock
2,Not for everyone,"Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample."
5,Almost too much of a good thing,"These were the first ""non-bear"" gummi I tried from Haribo.The quality, price, flavor = exceptional. Even my reluctant DH went crazy for these little froggies. The kids 4 and 3, also loved these little guys.The only minor downfall is that after 4 pounds you start to look at them and get a little ""flavored out"" - so I suggest sharing the joy cause our family of 4 just got a little apple weary. (but finished the bag anyway LOL!)"
2,Not the flavor I remember in the smaller frogs,We have enjoyed these candy Frogs in the past but these wre not nearly as good. I was expecting these to be the tasty treet of the past but these were made in another country and had a different rather unpleasant taste.
4,It was a good week to Test Drive ...,"It was a good week to Test Drive a deodorant -- lots of stress at work and it was warm and muggy too! I'm pleased to report that Dry Idea Unscented Roll-On was up to the task! Although it lists """"fragrance"""" as one of the ingredients, I couldn't detect any fragrance (I like that in an UNSCENTED deodorant). It didn't feel wet or sticky going on like some roll-ons; it also didn't sting after shaving. It kept me as dry as my regular stick deodorant. It may be a good value, but not being a regular user of this product, I can't tell how long it will last."
4,I definitely liked this deodorant a lot. When ...,"I definitely liked this deodorant a lot. When I first started using DRY IDEA Roll-On, I was a little leery since I had been using """"cream"""" deodorants. I didn't know if I would like the """"wetness"""" or not. Well, DRY IDEA is the best deodorant I've used in years. Even though it goes on """"wet"""", it dries rapidly and doesn't blemish your clothes. It kept me dry all day, even through very stressful situations. At the end of the day, no matter what kind of deodorant I've tried, my clothes either smell like the deodorant or a very slight body odor. Well, with DRY IDEA, this didn't happen. My clothes and my underarms are as fresh as when I got out of the shower and put the clothes on clean. Most deodorants cause me to itch. That's when every few days, I alternate deodorants. With DRY IDEA, this isn't necessary. I've been using it for over one week and still no itching! I'll definitely keep using DRY IDEA!!!"
3,"This was a good product, but the bottle ...","This was a good product, but the bottle opened in the box and spilled all over. But I tested the amount that was left in the deodorant bottle, and it was very effective. It was a good anti-perspirant that lasted all day, so I didn't have to use it more than once a day. I would recommend this product to others."
5,I liked this product a lot. The first ...,I liked this product a lot. The first thing it had going for it was the lack of scent -- I don't need my deodorant making my armpits smell like an ocean breeze or a flower garden. I liked the way it rolled on and it did a good job keeping me dry and odorless.
2,lame book,"I started reading this book, but I didn't feel I was learning anything. Maybe others will have a better experience."
2,too wordy,"I am sure this is an book has excellent content but I found it too wordy and dense, and abandoned it after a couple of chapters."
3,Too Large,I purchased a couple pair of shoes for my daughter's wedding. This shoe was not true to size. It was a nice looking shoe but itt was too large so I'm going to return it.
4,grows on you!,"Nod is deconstructionist, they mix lots of styles and sonic techniques. The title tract rocks with stones influences. Lots of Lou Reed and velvet under ground. Dug it more with each playing."
4,Title is a bit misleading,"'Murder in the Wind' by John D. MacDonald is also sometimes known as 'Hurricane'; this title although more bland, probably gives a better idea of what the book is about. The title 'Murder in the Wind' makes the novel sound like the story is a murder mystery, or a crime story, but really the novel is at heart a disaster story.Probably one of the earliest examples of the genre.MacDonald tells the story of a dozen people stuck in an abandoned house during a powerful hurricane. As with all classic disaster stories for the first part of the story we are given the background of the principal characters, there is a family, a newlywed couple, a pair of businessmen, a recent widow, a counterintellegence agent, and two escaped prisoners. Then the storm comes and the reader begins to wonder who will live and who will die."
5,An engaging biographical look into the intriguing life of Marietta Holley,"Marietta Holley: Life With ""Josiah Allen's Wife"" by Kate H. Winter (English Department Lecturer at the State University of New York at Albany) is an engaging biographical look into the intriguing life of Marietta Holley. This scholarly biographical and literary study deftly explores the historical interests of the popular writer Marietta Holley and many of the secrets that made her life and writing what it became. A very highly recommended read for students of literature, women's studies, and regional American cultural history."
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 26","*** 1964. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. A music critic tries in vain to meet a famous cellist in order to complete the biography he's writing about him. Strange comedy of the Swedish master who was aiming at teasing the people who gravitated around himself. ALL THESE WOMEN was also the first film in color of Bergman and was photographed by Sven Nykvist. Let's admit it, I didn't laugh a lot and I almost fell asleep ten minutes before the end of the movie. Nevertheless, Ingmar Bergman's faithful fans will appreciate to see Eva Dahlbeck, Bibi Andersson and Harriet Andersson playing unusual parts. A DVD zone curiosities."
2,Dont remember liking,Wasnt this another song he did with Crap sahnti off his latest album of the time.I remember not liking this song that muchLyrics 3/10 Production 6/10 Overall 4.5/10
3,swinging 60s tv,"The first episode has a youthful Chris Lee for the villain, involving robots, 15 years before BLADE RUNNER. The second episode has Diana Rigg the victim of a crazy movie director; sunset blvd with murders. The third episode has canadian donald sutherland back when he was doing a lot of british stuff, and also has an almost unreconizable charlotte rampling as a cowgirl! It involves being stuck on the usual mysterious island, with the usual rundown mansion.All in all, not bad; the usual wit and stylishness of the show."
4,Classic pouts and sheer pelvic joy,"This is the kind of sewer rat glam rock they just don't make anymore. If you're looking for the antecedent to the hornier elements of GunsNRoses and the whole early 90s LA rock scene, look no further. Girl spliced hard rock riffing (""Hollywood Tease,"" subsequently redone by singer Lewis' next band LA Guns, is a brutal opener) with pouty rhythms borrowed from Aladdin-era Bowie,early Japan (whose ""Adolesecent Sex"" is clearly the blueprint for ""Sheer Greed,"" down to the same engineer) and Toys-era Aerosmith. Sheer guilty pleasure. The sound is OK but could use a proper remaster; the liner notes are hack."
3,"Low-buget thrills, chills, and chuckles.","The East Side Kids meet Dracula, er, Bela Lugosi. Our daring and resourceful heroes, convicted of inner-city mayhem, find themsleves sentenced to a reform-school camp in the country. These little low-buget movies don't pretend to be more than they are. The comedy is low-brow but harmless. The thrills and chills are mild enough to qualify for family viewing. Bela Lugosi had become a low-budget standby at this point in his career. The Eastside Kids, if not lovable, are tolerable in small doses. Huntz Hall and Sunshine Sammy make the most of their comedic opportunities. Depending on your point of view, this is a good Halloween party tape for ""G"" rated audiences, or for more sophisticated viewers who enjoy humor that's so dumb it's funny. Don't spend time analyzing this film. Just kill and hour and enjoy it."
3,"Fun, In a Goofy Sort of Way","The Bowery Boys have always struck me as a little creepy. Men in their forties pretending to be pre-teens has struck me as very jarring (sort of like Roberto Benigni in ""Pinocchio""). Still, you could find worse comedians, and in this movie, they at least have the benefit of starring with the always wonderful Bela Lugosi. Basically, it's just the Bowery Boy's running around Lugosi's haunted house. It's kind of fun, in an odd way. The only major drawback is the presence of some racist jokes (""Put on some whitewash before you sneek up on me in the dark"").The DVD from Alpha looks good enough. Some shots are scratchy, others are dark, and the blacks aren't as solid as they should be, but it's as clear as you're likely to find ""Spooks Run Wild."" Unsurprisingly, there are no extras."
1,Stupidity runs wild in this typically pointless BBs entry,"This is one of the many Bowery Boys ghost stories and, as usual, an awful one. I was hugely disappointed by the film's crass execution, lack of any laughs, low budget, poor production values, and (even at its running time) feeling of overlength. It might appeal to forgiving viewers who don't mind a campy, badly dated exploitation pic. Otherwise look out!"
3,"Campy, harmless fun","This entry in the Eastside Kids series finds the boys at a country summer camp for inner-city troublemakers. One of them gets hurt and they wind up in a house ""haunted"" by Bela Lugosi.Production values are low (typical Monogram) but the fun factor is high as Bela chases the boys around for 2 or 3 reels until the rather disappointing finale.Best for fans of the Eastside Kids/Bowery Boys or Bela Lugosi but B-movie fans should also enjoy it."
2,"""Spooks Run Mild""","Monogram's 1941 pairing of Bela Lugosi and The East Side Kids certainly had potential for low-brow fun. Unfortunately, the laughs and chills never materialize in ""Spooks Run Wild."" The horror icon (wearing full Dracula regalia) does his best to enliven the proceedings, but cannot overcome poor production values and misfired gags. Slightly better than the second East Side Kids collaboration - ""Ghosts on the Loose"" (1943) - only because Bela gets more screen time."
5,era of r&b punjabi music,"First of all let me know u that if u like stuff like punjabi rap like bohemia or sukhshunder shinda or rdb jazzy b is father of em all.cool colleboration of hip hop,r&b bhangra.tight beats and soul stirring vocals."
3,I guess I'm just a little different,"I can't help but compare her work to her previous work. Lyrically, I think Fiona was at her best in When the Pawn Hits the. Musically, I find Jon Brion's production of When the Pawn Hits the to be the most engaging: different, but not offputting. I feel that on this album Fiona set out to be musically different and sort of forgot to make a good song. While the CD as a whole is somewhat disappointing, there are a few WONDERFUL tracks on here. Not About Love and Parting Gift are just amazing amazing songs. I love the shifts in Not About Love and Fiona's vocals in parting gift are amazing. I'm still listening to get a complete feel of the album, and even though I don't think it compares to her past work, I still cant help but find myself listening."
4,Guilty pleasure,"A little piece of nasty and grabbing suspense. It's like ""JAWS"" on the streets! Not very original, I'd say, but it's a fast and ""no-brains"" action novel."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I would give this no stars if I could. Don't waste your money. It cuts itself off repeatedly and often will only play half a song, sometimes it won't play the cd at all. I've had this only a week and I am already wanting to throw it away."
5,A valuable guideline for introducing and maintaining TQC.,"In international trade, price has become secondary to product quality, warranty coverage, and reliable customer service. We try to emphasize this principle by recommending that our clients read Bill Creech's excellent publication - and heed his advice and guidance. John R. Jagoe, Director, Export Institute END"
2,"If you MUST buy this book, get CHEAPEST copy !!!","The only redeeming quality about this book is that it's filled with pictures. However, they aren't necessarily GOOD pictures. Most of them you've probably seen a million times before. As evidenced on the front cover, a lot of the pictures are in black and white (or brown and white) and sometimes with added elements of color in themIf your looking for a sensational expose' about the prince's life then this book is NOT for you. Peter Archer pretty much plays it safe and sticks to verfiable facts. However, if you just want a straight biography about the prince without a lot of the fluff that other books often give then I suggest you buy this book at the cheapest price you can find."
4,I like this anti-perspirant a lot. It's very ...,"I like this anti-perspirant a lot. It's very effective and it really helps to protect against odor and wetness. It also has an anti-stain formulation, which is important for your clothes. The only thing I don't like is the sweet, powdery scent, but fortunately it fades in no time. Maybe a more fresh or a minty smell would help, especially for men. I recommend it for active people, but also for anybody who's looking for a good, effective anti-perspirant."
2,This went on very dry. I don't feel ...,"This went on very dry. I don't feel that it kept me as dry as other brands. Also, the smell was distasteful. I don't like the lingering aerosol fumes. I'd probably not recommend this to my friends or family. I think that the solid form of it may work."
4,My hubby really liked this. He said it ...,"My hubby really liked this. He said it did a great job protecting him and it smelled good too. This is one of the few products that my husband can wear due to his allergies. I'd greatly recommend this product to friends and family. I give this one a """"thumbs up""""."
2,i just don't fell this album,only 13 tracks..........and what's the deal puttin' on ANYTHING ? that song was on the Jay-Z album ........they are talking about some dynasty? Memphis Bleek is the only one along with DJ CLUE that iz good on ROC ..... much love to BEANIE...but he should have put more songs on it....2 stars.............peace
3,not bad but still needs to get better....,If you like the good beats and rhymes check this out. if you are in to the hardcore stuff pass this up stick to dre. and pac.
4,Somewhat the truth,"I liked the cd its a lot better than i thought it would be. Beanie flows shines through every track except a couple songs. the beats are somewhat weak. On a few tracks. but his flow helps out with that. bottom line if your're a roc fan youll like this cd. if your not you want be satisfied.( Jay's single ""anything"" is also on the cd) SOMEWHAT OF AN ADDED BONUS"
5,the truth,Beanie Sigel is the truth. He's the realest out of everybody at the Roc. Cop this album then make sure to cop his new album The B Is coming
1,Horrible,"This album was horrible. If it wasn't for the ""Anything"" track by Jay-Z this album probably wouldn't have sold."
1,THE TRUTH,"The truth is...............this album is really bad. I mean every song on this album is pure garbage. If you gave this album 5 stars, you really don't like rap. In fact, this album is a disgrace to rap music. WARNING : THIS ALBUM IS WHACK :"
3,Not great,If give this a 3.5 because its not great. Mac Man is pretty good and is somthing different. There are a few other decent tracks scatered around. Anything by Jigga is pretty good but I wonder why its even on there.
3,One-Two Punch,"I actually give it 3 1/2 stars. Beanie Sigel's style is like the Mike Tyson of rap. Hits hard with one or two blows, but I like it. Very New York, very gritty, and having the likes of Shawn Carter in your corner doesn't hurt you. Good freshman album. A hell of a lot better than Memphis Bleeks first. I think Memph Bleek tore too many pages off the Cash Money Catalog, but Beanie's keepin' it real in NYC."
3,realistic review,"Overall this album offers nothing new, except the way Beanie Sigel presents his delivery. The production is average and the lyrical content is played out and used up. Yeah yeah I know, that is how the artist grew up, but the stuff he is talking about is redundant. I mean 50 other artists said that stuff before. Bottom line I puchased Sigel's material, but I feel the production was very average. Peace."
3,it's cool wit me,"aiight- mac can flow, BUT the cd gets a bit redundant... he did too many samples, it's almost like jay-z gone bad boy... HOWEVER the hottest track on this joint is Stop-Chill... he should have cut that annoying joint with jigga anything he lost a star for that one..."
4,"Beanie Sigel is the ""TRUTH""","Whether or not Sigel or this album spits the ""Truth"" its forever inevitiable, but you can never deny his lyrical skills on the mic. Sigel has always been the more talented recruit from Roc-A-Fella. With one killer cut, (""Truth""), produced by Kanye West, Sigel shows why he's a premier artist in the Hip-Hop game. Although this album does have it's short comings like many Roc-A-Fella releases, but the one's that shoutout greatness makes it more worthwhile to purchase this release."
3,OVERRATED,"It's a decent offering for a mainstream release, but it doesn't offer anything new. Same lyrical content, same Jay-Z-souding beats, same Roc-a-Fella labelmates featured on the songs....same old same old. The Source gave it 4.5 mics out of 5, which is just ridiculous. 3 mics is more like it. But then again, The Source gave 4.5 mics to Black Rob's ""Life Story"" too, so I'm not surprised. Save your money and buy ""Quality Control"" by Jurassic 5. You won't be disappointed. Review by: PB Wolf"
4,THIS ALBUM IS BUTTERS,"YO,THIS ALBUM IS A MUST FOR ALL THE RUGGED THUG-OUT PEOPLES ACROSS THE WORLD. THE BEATS ARE INCREDIBLE AND HIS FLOW IS OFF THE METER.."
4,One of the Best Album's Out There,"Beanie Sigel's ""The Truth"" is a hot album. The first two songs ""The Truth"" and ""Who Want What"" makes you want to keep on listening to the album some more. In ""Who Want What"" Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek switch verses a lot which makes the song tight. The third song ""Raw and Uncut"" is wack. I think it's the worst rap song that I have ever heard. It even has Jay-Z on it. I found the song ""Mac Man"" Ok, but when you get to ""Playa"" it makes you want to play it again and again. It has a tight beat and Beanie Sigel can rhyme on his verse. For the rest of the rest of the songs are alright. For a first album that was pretty good, I can find Sigel rising to the top."
2,This album is terrible,"I was very disappointed with this one there only three good song's on it. The beat's were wack ,and the lyric's didn't move me like Roc-A-Fella artist usually do. If your looking for the Jay-Z style on this album forget it. Listen to this one before you buy it."
2,one good track,"Ok ill start off by saying i do like rap, and am not condemning the genre as a whole.But for someone who makes millions of dollars, and for someone your spending 15 dollars on,shouldnt they say more than an f word 500 times and call it a song?I mean, it seems to me now a days you put some pretty girls in a video, add in some language so that youll have to hide the cd under your bed, and then its good, right?No, not really.Beanie does have some pretty strong stuff.Its called the truth.It isnt that this album is bad, but with rappers like eminem, de la soul,method man ,raekwon,ice cube, and snoop dogg out, the same cussing a lot and an occasional rhyme just doesnt really suffice.Youd be better off getting the single if you could, or checking out some other cds.Nothing that new here."
3,Just Getting Warmed Up...I Hope,"2000 has witnessed some great rap debuts. I was hoping that The Truth would be one of them. It's good, but it's not great. Every song on this album feels like another Jay Z song, and he guest appears on enough tunes to make this album a team up. And speaking of guests, there are just way to many. As a debut artist, it's cool if your mentor wants to contribute, but you gotta let the artist do most of the talking. Rarley does Benie really cut loose like he did on some of his notable guest appearences. The production feels average. Still, this is a fine album, with some great stuff, ""The Truth"" is excellent, and ""Made Mac"" is a high point, but this one is not that spectacular. Try Drag On's ""Opposite Of H2O"" or Black Rob's ""Life Story"". This one falls a little short."
1,hmmmm..,"This albulm really blows! I dont know why i bought it. It has no originality to it. It sounds the same as any other rapper, i wanna hear something different, like bone thugs n harmony!"
3,not bad,"Nice debut for Beanie. This is a gritty, hard CD worth copping if you are into that. Not many standout tracks or upbeat ones either."
1,THIS IS [WEAK],"IM GOING TO BE REAL WITH YOU ,IF THIS CD DIDNT HAVE "" WHAT YOUR LIFE LIKE "" ON HERE THIS CD WOULD OF GOT A STRAIGHT ZERO FROM ME.THE RHYMES WAS IMMATURE. THE BEATS [are weak]..."
4,BETTA THAN I EXPECTED!,"i think beanie sigel is a very talented mc. his rap has meaning to it. i bought this lp 4 no track in particular.i just thought i'd explore anotha memba of tha rocafella crew. well beanie sigel is 10 times better than fake jay-z and is 2 times better than memphis bleek and is 9 times better than amil. he shines as an individual and his collaboration with otha philly-native eve on remember them days is awesome. him and memphis bleek hook up 4 a good song and his solos pac man and the truth r good. in the bonus track jay-z actually makes up some clever meaningful rhymes the 1st verse is dedicated to his homies, the 2nd to his mom, and the 3rd to his nephew. jay-z is actually good on this song. go out and get this lp because it really is the truth!"
2,Very Low Standards,"I was highly anticipating this album for a long time. This mc sounded very promising. Well, the production group of this album can be blamed for the downfall. Beanie's lyrics are tight, but the music doesn't sound good at all. These tracks are almost unbearable to listen to. They have almost no playback value. The song, Mac Man, was a good try, but failed. The best song is the first, title track. I was very disappointed by what I have heard. He's a tight mc, however, the only thing giving this album those 2 stars."
4,This is smoking,"The only reason I did not give this cd five stars is because, some of the songs, (maybe 2-3) were not the best. The rest were five star material. This is a great debut album, one every thug rap fan should have. If Beanie Sigel was this good at a debut album imagine how much better he can get over the years..... or maybe how much worse!"
4,"Beanie, The Mac","New Lp ""The Truth"" Is Tight As Hell. I Wasn't Too Sure About Purchasing It At First, Until A Friend Of Mine Was Banging It Loud From His Escalade. I Sampled The The Rest Of The Tracks, Then Immediately Went & Coped It."
4,A GREAT CD....AND THAT THE TRUTH!,"This CD is one of the greatest ive bought in a long time, all the songs had good beats, and the lyrics were deep. Can't wait for the next one!"
5,ROC-A-HARDCORE,This album is hot and so far this and black rob's album is the hottest joints out here of the year.
2,Stake your Dollars goodbye,"First off, Beware this is a ""choose your story"" book. Every few pages you are given a choice Buffy might make. As a big fan of Buffy, I managed to know ""What would Buffy Do?"" well enough to successfully complete the book in a very short time. I think I read maybe 40 or 50 of the 300 pages. Not what I consider my money's worth."
1,scam,"this is a copy of the real book. don't buy it. no publishing info, no page numbers. find the real thing. really disappointing to receive."
3,"All the Ingredients for a Great Novel, but it Collapses","It's hard to believe The Beautiful and Damned was written by the same author as The Great Gatsby. It's like Fitzgerald wrote this before he met Hemingway and Hemingway taught him how to write. I should like this book: I love The Great Gatsby, I enjoy ornate prose, and I appreciate watching a character slowly spiral downward. But it just does not work for me here.The main character is the scion of a wealthy family, a 1920s socialite, and a terrible drunk. The book mainly consists of his alcohol-soaked escapades as his life slowly disintegrates. What else is a wealthy couple to do? The ending is more than a bit manufactured and takes away from the rest of the novel."
5,I adore this book!,"Thought provoking and heartfelt, you get to know all of the characters intimately. And, as with all F Scott Fitzgerald books, it's very beautifully written. This is as much a poem as a fiction story."
3,Liked it but..,"As anticipated, Fitzgerald's writing is electric and beautiful. The story, however, is a sad account of two people's plummet into depression and despair. I wish I could have walked away feeling some kind of excitement or lesson learned from this book, but I instead came away with a dark outlook on humanity as it pertains to money and lust."
4,A Thrilling Book,"Length:: 5:04 MinsIn this video review I give a plot synopsis, read a passage, and give my overall opinion of the book. More info at http://owenhorwitzhonors.blogspot.com"
2,Not Among His Better Efforts,"As a fan of Fitzgerald's writing, I was truly disappointed bythis book. Verbose and somewhat boring early on in the text, the bookhas none of the best qualities of his better works. His tendency to write the elegant sentence is taken too far too often in this text, having the effect of a continual stream of unnecessary adjectives normally associated with writers below his caliber. The work also seems thrown together, with pieces of stage script and overly-sentimental poetry splashed among the pages. I can't help but think, with respect to how unpolished the product was, that he had an idea and a deadline and the deadline won. Better books to read by Fitzgerald are The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and even the unfinished The Love of the Last Tycoon. His collected short stories also offer enjoyable reading. I realize I am at odds here, but I cannot recommend this book."
5,The Beautiful and Damned,"F. Scott Fitzgerald always had that ability to make his characters both believable and so very real. Grab this book now, and enjoy the three different endings available in this edition. You will return and read it again and again!"
1,Disappointing Narration of a Superb Classic,"If you wish to bask in the fruits of F. Scott Fitzgerald's powerful penning, I suggest you avoid this audiobook. While undoubtedly well-meant, the narrator's obsession with enunciation becomes quite annoying when prolonged over a 15-hour period. Passionate dialogue and magnificent descriptions rapidly grow dissatisfying and forced when inflicted with the meticulous pronunciation of even the most common words. Thankfully, there is an alternative in the version rendered (superbly) by William Dufris. It is both cheaper and far more enjoyable than this disappointing interpretation of Fitzgerald's timeless work."
2,Rather disappointing,"I have never read an F Scott Fitzgerald novel before so thought I'd start with this. Whilst Fitzgerald is undoubtedly an excellent writer, this novel left me cold. The descriptions of the places and the atmosphere of the setting were really evocative, however I found the main characters, Anthony, Gloria and their friends cold, calculating and shallow. Gloria is obsessed by her looks and Anthony thinks of himself as an intellectual too good to have to work. They are complacent, and their apathy towards anything but their pursuit of pleasure and their inheritance comes through. Although I do not doubt that Anthony & Gloria loved each other, they loved themselves more. Their passion for each other was lacking. Maybe the author never intended us to like them, howeverI disliked them so much I didn't care in the end what the outcome would be."
4,The irreverant leisure class,"Anthony Patch, undeserving heir to a multi-million dollar estate, grows increasingly annoying, petty, and selfish as this novel progresses. He is an admirable college student as the novel begins, seemingly trying to 'find himself' and live up to his grandfather's expectations. But as his financial security destabilizes, so does his moral character. It's an interesting progression, all the more fascinating because it gives us working class types an opportunity to despise the filthy rich. There are definitely some slow moments in the novel, alot of forced philosophical musings, but the prose and the soap-opera like ending make it worthwhile."
4,Fitzgerald fan,I downloaded this because after reading the Great Gatsby I was a fan and I wanted to check out some of his other works.
3,"If you want Fitzgerald's best, look elsewhere!","I was first swept away by the writing of Fitzgerald, as I suppose most people were, in his classic text, The Great Gatsby. This book also chronicles romance and ""the fast life,"" but is not nearly as captivating. For those who love Fitzgerald, this is still a good read. However, I would sooner recommend Gatsby, or This Side of Paradise."
5,"obviously a classic, but which edition is the best buy?","Fitzgerald's tale is obviously a classic, but which edition is the best buy? There are so (or is ""too""...) many available. Personally, I like this editonThe Beautiful and Damned(yes, you need to click the link to see which one it is as Amazon combines many reviews together), especially because of the captivating cover shot. A great value IMHO."
1,"Great Book, Terrible Quality","The book is a classic, and if you like Fitzgerald you'll like the book. But the binding of this edition is terrible. The whole first half of the book fell out while I was on the first read."
3,Damned average,"The Beautiful and Damned is a Naturalist novel that recounts the slow dissolution of Anthony Patch, heir to a large fortune, and his charmingly immature, hedonistic, and impulsive wife Gloria.There's something a little ""off"" in this novel--even saying the title out loud requires an odd caesura. The plot has a feeling of artificial inevitability. Early on, it's easy to sympathize with Patch, even to root for him, but at times his thought processes and actions are so maudlin that one wants him to just *fall* already. Gloria is a fine and interesting character, but by and large the peripheral characters are closer to caricatures.The book's strength is its prose, natural and authoritative, never self-consciously clever to an annoying extent. Fitzgerald's pacing is steady; occasional meandering narrative passages are fished quickly out of the water with dialog and plot events.All in all it's a fairly good book, worth a read if you're NOT looking for the near-great Gatsby."
1,BORING,This is the most boring book I have ever read. Fitzgerald babbles and his characters are lifeless and dull. Don't waste your time.
3,Lengthy Criticism of Wasted potential,"The extremley long second novel of Fitzgerald explores many of the same questions that Fitzgerald probed in his first novel, ""This Side of Paradise."" This book is very long and could have been abridged and reached the same point. His least exceptional book by far, but a lyrical masterpiece none-the-less. The loss of potential by the novel's protagonist, Anthony Patch is less emotional than the bildingsroman of Amory Blaine or the character deterioation in ""Tender is the Night."""
5,Fitzgerald is Magic,"Despite the fact that I'm not even 25 yet, Fitzgerald is my favorite author. The way that he crafted words together is breathtaking. He was an artist of the type that don't exist anymore. Beautiful and the Damned is no exception. He brings the characters alive so beautifully, his astute and poignant reflections on human nature and interactions are timeless, they hold as true today as they did when he wrote them. I will hungrily devour more Fitzgerald and enjoy it just as much, I'm sure."
4,"Typical, beautiful Fitzgerald",IT reads like most of his works. Great for those wanting more than just Gatsby and can enjoy the stories.
3,Worth reading,"The characters are hard to relate too, however they are interesting throughout. This book was good but did not leave me wanting more, only content with its outcome. That might have been what Fitzgerald wanted though."
3,Beautiful and damned,"Great writing, but the subject matter tested my ability to sympathize with poor little rich kidsXxx xxx xxx xxx"
4,The beautiful,I'm still reading this book but it is holding my interest. It is so very well written. I enjoy it very much.
1,I expected a much more polished job.,Fleischer's writing is surprisingly clunky; the text of TAKING HEAT would benefit greatly from the ministrations of a capable editor. And shouldn't communicating effectively be the strong suit of a famous professional liar?
1,Waste of money,"This is a work of either ignorant or delusional right-wing propaganda. To actually ask people to believe that a completely neutered and house trained press was actually giving the Bush whitehouse a harder time than previous governments is a hard sell, but to, for example, completely skip over the unprecedented events of Bush's inauguration as if they didn't happen is revisionist history at its worst. Don't waste your money like I did."
3,"FODDER FOR DEBATE, DISTRIBE AND DISCUSSION","You probably know before reading that this will not be an unbiased view. Reading that he sometimes felt like a ""pinata"" reinforces that opinion. Well, everyone's entitled to have their say and so this is Ari Fleischer's take and now it's his turn.Whether one agrees with his views or now, Ari Fleischer served as the White House press secretary during some of our country's most momentous days, from 9/11, the prelude to the war in Iraq, and more.Mr. Fleischer has no love for the press and reiterates what he feels are some of their more frigid exchanges. He has high praise for his former boss, Mr. Bush, extolling his leadership abilities. No surprises here.Condemn him or praise him, his story is sure to be fodder for debate, diatribe, and discussion."
1,You won't learn anything new here ...,"I tried to be fair and open-minded while reading ""Taking Heat"", I really, really tried but ... my, my. You'd think, after reading this book that, according to Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush is the next best thing to God on earth. Mr. Fleischer does nothing to shed any light on the numerous cover-ups, the abundance of misleading information and outrageous lies that have spilt forth from the Bush White House. It would appear that accepting responsibility for his part in the cover-ups, lies and misinformation isn't something Mr. Fleischer is interested in. On another note, the writing was awful - my 13 year-old could have written ""Taking Heat"" better. Worse book I've ever read."
1,A Lost Opportunity,"I read this book hoping to get some insight as to what happened in the first Bush Administration and the way the White House sold the war in Iraq. Instead Ari Fleischer, a man so close to these events, comes across as a Bush loyalist who supports and justifies Bush's policies. It was a waste of time and a lost opportunity to give us some insight and help give us some historical information and honest reflection.There is no discussion of how they used the press to manipulate the public and sell the war. For example, he claims the President was careful never to link Iraq with 9/11. But he never addresses why 70% of the American people in 2003 believed otherwise. How did that happen?After leaving the White House, he is still spinning the President's position and blaming the liberal media. Too Bad...."
1,obfuscation,The former press secretary was used to not giving out news and information at the press conferences and daily briefings. He has continued that practice in this book. Save your money.
5,Great for little money,A ton of info packs this book which costs less then $6 with shipping when buying used!
2,Look Inside Your Body,"I didn't realize this book had more to do with private parts than the actual human body. I thought I was getting all of the various body systems, so I thought the content was too advanced for a kindergartener. I will save this book for when she is a little older."
3,The product's scent was a little too strong. ...,"The product's scent was a little too strong. It went on wet but dried quickly and felt very dry. It works very well if you like roll-ons. Someone who is used to a stick may have a difficult time adjusting to it in the beginning. Overall, I would recommend it to my friends."
3,I liked the scent of the product. I ...,"I liked the scent of the product. I thought it had a very natural scent and it wasn't overpowering. I wasn't very fond of the roll on feature. I thought it was a little too awkward. I also didn't like the fact that it left a white residue. I live in Texas so I tend to wear tank tops and having the white on my underarm isn't very pleasant. Overall, I think it's a good product. I would definitely wear it during the winter when my underarms won't be seen but I wouldn't recommend it for the summertime."
4,Lots of good bite-sized tips,This book is structured as a compendium of lists on things such as how to make a cold call to how to manage your attitude. Many good ideas and useful for reference.
3,A little slow,This has some good info in it for a salesperson. I thought it was a little slow of a read though.
1,Very Disappointing,This book was extremely disappointing. I expected much more from the reading. This book is not worth the paper it was printed on. I would not doubt if the positive reviews are from the authors themselves. They are very misleading. This book was a complete waste of time.
1,Lets go green,"I have never been this disappointed buying any book in my life. What a waste of time and money. I hope one day government gets involve and review books before they get published. Mean while let's go green and save some poor trees, not to mention your hard earned money."
1,what's up with the directions?,"This is the worst item. There is very little direction on how to use it. There are very many different bottles out on the market and all it says is to use so much water for an 8 oz. or 4 oz. bottle. Well, you don't use all 4 or 8 oz. a lot of the time, so you have to guess on how much to put in the thing. I know as a new mom I want somthing that doesn't make me do all the guessing work. At one time I would have a bottle to hot and another time it would be to cold and they would come straight out from the fridge. So what's up with that?!"
1,Save your money,"At first this was a great product. I used it for about 2 weeks and the on-off switch began letting off sparks. Which turned otu for the best. In a pinch I started placing warmed water in a thermos. And it works better, no waiting and always a warm water supply no matter where I am. Like I said save your money and invest in a really good thermos:>"
3,"Not a necessary item, but nice for some!","We bought this anticipating my husbands on-call performances at night time with our second child (my first was up every 2 - 3 hours for a few months and Daddy got the midnight slot). However, as I am breastfeeding and occassionally pumping milk I thought we would use it for sure, once in a blue moon it turns out whenever I am leaving baby with Daddy and an expressed bottle of milk (which he can easily leave out for an hour before as its breastmilk/room temperature!) Our wee one only gets up once a night at 3am so I may as well do it and sleep later into the morning, we're all up at 6am anyway!So, to conclude, not a necessary item for US and hardly used, perhaps formula feeding and more demanding babies would use it - as a shower gift it would be fine but don't bother spending extra yourself."
3,"Good, but you don't need the cooler","This warms your bottles just fine, but it is a little hot once you pull it out. The cooler doesn't keep the bottles cold enough, so I'd get the cheaper version without it."
4,MUST HAVE!!!,"If you register for nothing you MUST register for this. Especially if you are formula feeding. THis is fantastic. Absolutely easy to use, the cooler keeps bottles cold all night. The only issue you have is to work out how much water you need to heat your bottles. Start with the lowest recommended and then just work your way up. not that hard at all. If you have a 2 floor homr you will love not heading to the kitchen to get or heat a bottle. I truly recommend this product. It is fantastic. 5 stars if the water bottles were a little easier to use and fill."
3,Cheaply made but serves it purpose for a while,"I purchased this product with my first child. It worked well for a while until the button you click to start the warmer popped out. I could still use it but constantly had to re-adjust the warmer button which was a huge pain. And you have to wipe the warmer out after every few uses. The inside turns brown and starts to smell if you don't. Also...the vile that you use to measure the water depending on what size botton you are warming needs to be gently hand washed. The numbers rubbed off completely on the side of the vial showing you how much water to use for your bottle to be warmed and I had to get a permanent marker and re-label it. All in all it is a decent product, easy to use as well but doesn't hold up for very long. I have twins on the way so I won't purchase this product again."
4,A must have,"My children are 12 years apart and I wish they would have had this item with my first. It is so easy to use and makes those middle of the night feedings just a little more tolerable. If you get into a routine: ( wake up place the bottle in the warmer change the diaper the bottle is done by the time you are and has even had time to cool for a moment). I only had one problem with getting the bottles 2 hot but that was my fault from heating them twice. Go figure. I had a c-section and we lived in a 2 story house, what trips this saved my husband from going downstairs all night was well worth the money."
1,ICE COLD,"hate it! it doesn't warm up a refrigerated bottle no matter how much water you put in it. you can't lock the cooling unit into the warmer, so it's hard to carry around. forget this one!"
3,Could Be Better,"I gave this warmer 3 stars because it COULD BE FASTER and MORE EFFICIENT in warming up bottles. You have to use more water than you're supposed to, so you have to fill up the tube with water sometimes two whole times to provide enough heat for the bottle. Secondly, it takes a long time to warm up each bottle--about four or five minutes. Also, it could be ""cleaner,"" the bottles come out soaking wet--we had to keep a dry towel handy to dry off each bottle after being warmed. Also, if you use disposable bag inserts, the machine won't work. You can only use traditional plastic bottles with the warmer. The bags get sopped with water. Minus all of the negatives, if you live in a rather large home or a two story, the cooler part of the warmer is VERY convenient as you don't have to make a trip to the fridge in the middle of the night."
4,nice bottle warmer but not fast enough for my baby,I really like this bottle warmer. It heats up the bottles well. It gets 4 stars because I think it takes way too long to heat up a bottle. My son screams waiting for the warmer to get done. I have also never used the cooler. In my opinion to me it's just as easy to grab a bottle out of the fridge. It is a nice warmer though and I would recommend it to others just as long as their baby is patient enough to wait the minute or mintue and a half that it takes to warm up the bottle.
2,Not very Useful,"I bought this product thinking I would need it, but as it turns out, it is superfluous. I use powdered formula and water when I make a bottle. I just weaned my baby and so now when I get up to get him a bottle, all I have to do is mix it when he is ready. There really is no need to make it up ahead of time, chill it and then warm it up. I use bottled water that is room temperature and that suits him fine. If your baby requires a warm bottle, then this would be a useful product."
1,Waste of Money!!!,Personally I think bottle warmers are a waste of money. If your baby is hungry they want to eat now and don't want to wait for a bottle to warm up in this thing. It takes too long. I got one for my shower and I'm so mad that I threw the box away because I wish I could return it. I have always just warmed the bottle in the microwave. So many people are against that but as long as you shake up the bottle before you feed the baby there's no problem. Only an idiot wouldn't check the temp before feeding their baby anyway. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE THE MICROWAVE. It's so much faster!!
1,Not worth the time or money,"I purchased this bottle warmer thinking ""Oh I'm pregnant, it's on the list of must haves"" so I bought it. First of all, If you don't have to climb up and downstairs to reach the kitchen, you don't need this. You can just use your microwave. Manufacturers suggest not doing so because they say the formula wont heat evenly. Well, thats nothing a little shake can't remedy. Just heat 10 seconds at a time. Second, it doesn't heat the bottle with the recommended water level. It's either to hot or not hot enough. Believe me, I had to run the bottle under cold water until finally I gave up on this product. What a waste. I do however use the ice pack that comes with it when I run out with the baby. It does help keep the formula cold inside an insulated bag of course."
1,Not helpful at all,This warmer was a waste. I use the Playtex disposable bottles and when I would add the required amount of water the bottle would still be cold then when I would add more water and do it again then it would get too hot then I'd have to wait for it to cool down all while my little munchkin is getting pissed that he has to wait so long for his bottle. I just drop his bottle is a bowl and run hot water on it and a minute later it's ready.
3,Unecessary,"I found this to be unecessary. I don't usually store formula so I didn't need the cooling compartment. As far as heating up the bottles when I need to, I find it quicker & easier to just pop a mug of water in the microwave for 2 minutes & then let sit the bottle in it for a minute or so. Plus, there's nothing taking up counter space."
4,Works good,We got this because of all the reviews we read. We really like it and are very pleased with the results. Only issue is sometimes the milk comes out a little warmer then we prefer but by trial and error we have figured out what level to put the water at to get a bottle at the tempature we like.
4,I can't believe someone would try to heat a bottle any other way!,"The only thing this bottle warmer won't due is heat the bottle by itself, but it's darn close. This is my first experience with warming bottles and this instrument is a must have, especially at 3am in the morning. With the cooler in the back, my wife and I were discussing putting another one of these babies in our bedroom using the ice pack to keep our bottled milk cool and then popping it into the heater when the ""big guy"" is ready for his AM Feedings. We use Avent bottles and they are perfect for this warmer."
1,not for use with Dr. Brown's bottles,"The formula does boil and bubble over. I ended up returning this item - it was easier and faster to just go downstairs and make a bottle then to have to hassle with removing the vent of the Dr. Brown's bottle or the hassle of cleaning up the mess that is made when the milk boils over... Plus, the heating isn't consistent."
2,not fast enough,I disagree with this item being a must have...it takes way to long to heat up bottles at night. 2 to 4 minutes of my twins screaming can feel like a life time at 3am. I'm sad I wasted the money on it.
2,Would NOT Purcahse Again,"This bottle warmer would be perfect if it actually worked all the time but it does not. About 1/2 or more of the time, the bottles are cold even though we changed nothing and followed the directions. It is just hit and miss with it. In addtion, there is a burning odor in the room from the warmer and when you remove the bottles and dry them off you are then left with brown circle stains on the towel. We can not figure out why the brown stuff is being generated but we can see it at the bottom of the warmer and assume it is realted to the burning odor."
2,Too hot,"This bottle warmer overheats the bottle and actually shattered a glass container due to extreme heat. My husband burned his hand on a bottle when removing it from the warmer. It does heat fast, too fast. I am sticking with my Advent warmer."
2,Warmer,"I use platex nurser with the disposable liners, and when I tried to heat it in the warmer sometimes it would be cold other times it would get so warm that the liner would leak. I would not recommend buying this item. It is much easier just to the bottle in a glass on warm water"
1,waste of money,"We registered for this as it looked like a great item. Ended up having to get it ourselves and wish we never did. We had issues right from the start with incorrect heating. Either it was still cold or more often, it would be scalding hot. Bit of a safety concern with a newborn and maybe the company should look into this issue. We'd have to put the bottle into the freezer for 10 minutes or so and try to calm a screaming baby because he was hungry and didn't understand that he couldn't eat because his warmer didn't work. We read the directions and followed them to the letter, but had very inconsistent results each time. We now just make bottles on the spot and baby eats formula at room temperature. Takes MUCH less time and isn't a safety hazard."
4,"indispensable, but could be a little more user-friendly","I agree with everything that Jeannine A. Greco wrote in her review. I know that the folks at The First Years took feedback about the previous model to heart, because this one is much better. Still, here are the things that keep me from giving it five stars.The lid of the cooler is hard to lift off with one hand. This is a problem when you have a squirmy and/or crying baby in the other arm like I usually do.The lines printed on the measuring cups to tell you how much water to add to heat an X ounce bottle rubbed off in a matter of weeks. When I contacted First Years, they sent me replacements at no charge. The gradations should be etched, not printed, as guessing at amounts and overheating a bottle could lead to burns.In spite of the above, I highly recommend this product if you're bottle feeding -- it certainly beats heating a bottle the old-fashioned way!"
2,I've had it with this product....,"I just finished cleaning out the bottle warmer of Dr. Brown spillage YET AGAIN. We never overfill the botttles past the 8 oz mark and usually fill the water vile on the warmer right at or slightly below the 8 mark. The end result is always up in the air - sometimes perfect, other time way to hot and of course the random spillage. If we fill the water vile closer to 7, the bottles are too cold, which is why we always go closer to the 8 mark. In the end, we often find ourselves standing at the bathroom sink running the bottle under cold water while our 3 month old is having a fit in her crib. I'm going to try removing the center tube in the bottle to try and eliminate the leaks, but even if that works it doesn't solve the temperature issue."
5,Use common sense and have no problems,"I think this is a must have for anyone with a need to warm a bottle. I must say that I have just started to use the Dr Brown's bottles and without reading any kind of directions common sense tells you to remove all but the bottle and the formula to warm it up. Why would anyone think to leave a piece of rubber or a nipple on the bottle. Come on everyone use some common sense here. If you follow measurements listed on your warmer you should have no problem. I have used the same warmer for my second baby and It still works great. And I don't know anything about 5 minutes, my bottles are ready in about 2 to 3 minutes and just the way my baby likes them. Great product!!!"
5,Best one out there!,I simply love this machine! After you learn how to use the measuring and all that this machine saves me so much time and worry. Time over boiling water in a cup to let the bottle or baby food warm up in and worry over is it too hot or too cold still or is it warmed up evenly. With the night & day bottle & food warmer I don't have to worry about anything. If your looking for a bottle/food warmer buy this one!
3,Inconsistent,"When we first started using the bottle warmer, I thought it was awesome. It really beat warming the bottle up in hot water. It works so quickly. My complaints are: 1.) The burner is hard to clean and is starting to let off a burnt formula odor 2.) It does not heat consistently. I wait for the bottle to heat up and then sometimes it is warm - sometimes it is cold. Then you can not reheat for another 10 mins - What baby wants to wait another 10 mins and what parent wants to at 3 in the morning?I also use the Dr. Brown's bottles and I recommend removing the vent and cap to avoid overheating. I keep a papertowel in front of the warmer so I can keep the vent on it while heating and then I use the papertowel to shake the bottle afterwards because you will get some leakage (nature of Dr. Brown's bottles unfortunately)."
3,Does what it says,"This item was something that I really wanted when my son was born. He's still using bottles at night, but we are no longer using this. We have realized that it is just easier to fill the bottles with water and just add the powder when he wakes up. For others that use other methods of feeding (expressed milk, ready-to-serve formula, etc.) this product might be easier.There are two complaints that I do have about this though. The lid for the cooler compartment is awkward to grip. The shape makes it hard to hold with one hand and the texture is slick. There were more than a few times it went crashing around at 2 AM. I had seriously thought about roughing it up with some sand paper to give it some grip. Also, the markings for the water level (on the viles) came off very quickly. We finally just figured out where to measure to through trial and error.Like I said, it does what it says, but I don't feel that it's been worth it."
3,Heating not always consistent,Can't quite figure out the magic amount of water to put in the warmer to get a consistent bottle temperature.....most often it is too cold or too hot for the Playtex disposable bottles we use.....but it is quicker than heating under warm water as you can't boil Playtex disposable bottles. Not sure how it compares to other bottle warmers out there. We don't use the cooler part yet...so no comment on that.
2,Save ur $$,Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice. It allows the bottle to be stored on low for 8 hours and actually will boil water if need be!
5,Great for night feedings,"This is a great item for nighttime feedings. No running downstairs to the kitchen for bottles. I put it on my nightstand so I don't even have to get out of bed to get a bottle. It holds 2 bottles. Because my son actually needs 3 bottles during the night, I use a insultated bottle tote to hold his bottles."
5,Great product for new (frazzled) parents!,"Love this product. We just pop in our bottles and they're ready to serve in a few minutes, no more wasting so much water to heat in a bowl or cup. So glad we bought it!"
3,Great product,"When my newborn just wouldn't breastfeed, i was devistated. I really wanted him to have the benifit of breastmilk. I ended up buying a pump and started doing double duty. We decided to buy the night and day bottle warmer to keep in our room for night time feedings. We Love it! It warms my already expressed milk super fast and we don't have to come downstairs. We haven't had problems with bottles getting too hot like other reviews have.The only thing that I don't care for is the bottle cooler. I found that it didn't keep the bottles cool enough for my liking. I now use the cooler that came with my pump and am going to return this cooler/warmer for just the warmer."
5,Must Have for Any Mom who uses a Bottle,"My daughter is 6 months old and I still use this product everyday to warm her bottles and her baby food. It never gets the bottles too hot and they are never too cold - always just right. The baby food portion takes a little longer than the microwave, but there are no hot spots in the food that can burn baby's mouth. When she was newborn, this product kept me from running up and down the stairs at all hours of the night. Make 2 bottles, put in the cooler and just warm when baby is ready to eat. The icepack keeps the bottles cold all night."
4,Night and Day Bottle Warmer,"This is a great item. Even having a small house, it still is a great time saver/useful especially in the middle of the night. We keep ours on the end table right next to our couch where the late night feedings take place. Couple warnings, ours did not always heat the same each time, even with measuring the same so always check to make sure did not over heat, and always keep a towel to drop off any dripping water as it can be very hot. Does not work w/ the vent air bottles"
3,Returned it after I found out it takes 5 minutes to warm a bottle,"This is a good idea in theory, but in reality, what baby will wait 5 minutes for a bottle to warm? The faster, easier solution is to microwave a few ounces of water in a bowl (we use a large Pyrex measuring cup) until the water is hot and put the bottle in the bowl until it's warm. This method takes less than 5 minutes, i.e. you don't have to hear your baby scream for 5 minutes."
2,Just don't like,I just don't like this product. Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot. I just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way. It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product.
2,Inconsistent and Unnecessary,"This warmer frequently oveheated bottles to the point at which they were steaming and could have seriously burned baby. Then had to listen to baby scream while another one heated up, which seemed to take forever. We finally figured out it is WAY WAY easier to fill a bunch of clean bottles with the right amount of formula powder and just add room-temperature water. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,Got the bottle warm but not the formula,"Read all the reviews on this product and decided it was a ""must have"". Each time I tried to use it the bottle would get warm but the formula wouldn't. I returned it. Save your money and pop your bottle in the microwave for 8 seconds."
4,My cats loved them,"They're not just rolling balls for your cats to toss around. They've got little nubblies on the surface that the furkids love to touch and roll around.The seller is fast and friendly with their service. My two packages of Galaxy balls came quickly and they were packed to prevent breakage. Very pleased.Rebecca Kyle, June 2008"
4,Nice mat,"I like the mat, seems very durable and of good quality; though it's a little pricey (that's why 4 stars instead of 5). I purchased this mat intending to use it on my hardwood floor to help dampen noise from the trainer|bike, but ended up placing the trainer in a room with a rug. I still use the mat in order to catch any oil or crud that may drip from my bike, but have found that the trainer doesn't stay flat on the rug -- it tends to slip a little bit and bunch up around the places where it contacts the trainer. This is not an issue while riding, but is a cosmetic thing. The trainer seems to be pushing and stretching the mat into the rug."
4,Does what it is supposed to,"The mat does what it is supposed to. The quality seems to be good. And it lies flat on the floor, even though it came rolled up in a tube. No complaints so far."
2,Not as pictured,"I currently own one of the CycleOps mats shown in the photo, the one with the white logo and the word printed across it. That is a great mat. It is quality and of substance.The mat I received, which I presume has been replaced by the white one, has a yellow Cycle Ops logo. This mat is not worth the price. It's thinner, moves around a lot on carpet and I would not waste the money. Very disappointed.I purchased this mat. It was not a VINE acquisition. This mat is better than nothing, but not much better. Look around. Amazon has some other mats for around $30.00, which can't be thinner or worse than this thing."
5,Over-priced but looks great.,"If you bought the trainer and the plastic climbing block, you might was well spring for the mat. If for a dime in for a dollar. Besides, it looks really cool and keeps the gunk of your floor/rug."
3,Works as stated,The CycleOps mat arrived at my door in no time with Prime shipping. When I took the mat out of the box though the sticker peeled off so now it is just a blank mat. It seems to absorb vibration but my CycleOps trainer makes more noise and it is the Fluid 2. The mat also is a little short so the front wheel is barely on the mat.
5,CycleOps Training Mat,"Our basement was newly carpeted and I didn't want to damage it when using my trainer. This works great and doesn't bunch up on the carpet - which is nice. You can, very carefully, move the entire mat with the trainer and bike - you just have to watch what you are doing. The mat seemed expensive, but has been worth it to protect the carpet."
4,"Does the job, but some surface issues","This is a high quality mat that will protect your floor from damage, dirt, sweat, etc. when using a bicycle trainer (or a variety of other floor-damaging activities, I imagine). It also has a lot of traction, so your trainer won't slide around as you're using it. It's thick and heavy and feels like it will serve its purpose well. Very soon after I received it, however, the CycleOps decal began peeling off--I ended up removing it entirely. Also, it picks up dust really easily. Note what it's for--protection and stability. It's not squishy for gymnastics. Finally, well, it's a big black mat--possibly not so nice for a living room, depending on your flooring and color scheme. Of course, if you're going to use it in a garage, dedicated exercise/activity room, balcony, etc., then it will fit the bill just fine."
5,Good training mat,"Its a good mat. It doesn't slip, gives a bit of padding without being squishy, and is the right size for biking. It also works well over short carpet for crunches, etc. Rolls up tight with a tie or the original box to fit under a sofa."
3,a preview of better albums,"This is a CD including both Bailter Space's album TANKER and their earlier EP NELSH. There are a few good tracks here, but it's not nearly as good as some of their later work, particularly VORTURA.It's similar to My Bloody Valentine and the JPS Experience, with a noisy, wall-of-guitars sound, but a little more angular and jerky. It's true, the NELSH EP does resemble New Wave or mid 1980's pop to some degree. This combined CD shows glimmers of genius, but at times the songs are just not what they could be.Bailter Space are from New Zealand, and among them are several former members of the Gordons. They sound a little bit like other New Zealand bands of the 80s and 90s like The Clean, The Chills, and the Bats.An optional purchase, except for Bailter Space completists. If you own nothing by the band, you'd do better to start with their CD VORTURA.ken32------"
5,2nd Best album by the sonic surgeons of Bailter Space,"This CD includes the first E.P. Nelsh, which isn't so great, very 80's new wavey. But Tanker is guitar destruction and salvation. ""Grader Spader"" features guitar shredding that is on the level of Hendrix, and at the same time other songs are so melodic that they sound otherworldy, an antecedent to Robot World. Excellent production job from Brent Mclachlan who would go on to be the drummer in Bailter Space, although Hamish Kilgour is excellent on this album. In terms of sound, vaguely like My bloody valentine but better, and released I think before that bands landmark works. Check this out."
2,What Has Happened to InuYasha?,"I was just ever so excited when i saw the 3rd InuYasha dvd.. wheile i thought the story line looked a little weak, i am utterly obbsessed with inuyasha, so i thought i would give it a try... but low and behold my instincts were correct! The story line is lacking any actual substance and just from the dvd menu the bad animation can be seen. Did the same people animate this one? While i continue to be obbsessed with Inuyasha, i really do wish i hadn't waisted the money on this DVD."
1,What is this?,"I have seen several episodes of the tv inuyasha and they are pretty interesting, I am really into the storyline that a modern day girl goes back to the fedual era and have adventures. But this movie is mostly about the main characters father and it was really boring in my opinion."
5,cool,The seller was so kind and they delivered my order fast! I love this movie it is so cool and very good! The movie is in great condition too. Very happy!
4,Excellent 2nd sequel to a great anime series,"Having seen the first 2 movies on DVD, I'm happy to report that this one is just as good, if not better then the first two; in all areas: animation, acting and story.If the first movie was about a love that crossed the bounds of time and the second was about teamwork and something alongs those lines, then the third is about feuding brothers and them having to work together to save the world.Everyone knows the story for the film by now; either by the earlier reviews or by various other means, so I won't reiterate it. It works for the most part but unfortunatly doesn't truely advance the main story like say the Star Trek and most of the Gundam films do.If it wasn't for the filler nature of the whole affair I would give it 5 big stars but as it stands, I give it 5 stars minus 1 star."
4,great cd player,"this is an amazing cd player. it has all you could want and more. great sound, great features, lightweight, has a great color, and you can listen to FM stations. my only complaint is that that FM antenae could be a tad bit stonger. otherwise, this player is excellent for its price. i'm actually buying a new one cuz i dropped my old one and although it still works perfectly, i decided it was time for a change. i was about to get something else, but i couldn't find another player that matched this one."
4,A GREAT CD PLAYER,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU GUYS BUT I THINKN THIS IS A GREADT CD PLAYER. THE COLOR IS TERIFIC AND IT'S SUPER LIGHT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BETTER CD PLAYER OR IF THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST CD PLAYER YOU SHOULD GET THIS ONE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT . THANX
2,Hmmm...,It's going to take quite a bit of money to convince me that this is that much better than a quality board you can get at Toys R Us for $15. No thank you.
4,Enjoyable payoff,"Perry is a pro, who like many others this year decides to opt for a change of characters. Walker and Stillman, whose names seem to describe their personalities, are pupil and teacher in this interesting thriller. (Echoes of John Sanford's computer thrillers) You will not be able to stop once you get to the last 100 pages. Great descriptive writing- ""Seeing her pull clothes over that smooth, white body was like watching the moon being obscured by dark clouds"", is just one of the rewards of this work. Have fun."
5,"More, more, more-----------","I bought this in hardback when it first came out because I have enjoyed this authors work for some time. I was not disappointed. This book builds to a really different and interesting climax and the characters of John Walker and Max and the others were fascinating. Even the murdered woman became real and you grieved with John at her death. The reason for her death enraged you. In all of this, Thomas Perry engaged you from start to finish.I, personally, think John & Co are worthy of a series of their own, but I, unlike some people, do like a beginning, a middle, and an end to a series. I loved Jane whitfield and it was believable that she retired. (I also love Babylon 5-a five year TV series that came to a conclusion) I would like to get to know John Walker better."
2,not his best work,"I'm a huge fan of Perry's Whitefield series - I'm always sad when I've reached the end. Not so with this one. Perry's writing isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The first half reminds me of Ayn Rand - it's sparse. She, however, pulled it off much more effectively than Perry. Also in her favor, Rand had a point to make with her plot and her style, which Perry doesn't seem to. The second half reminded me of Robin Cook or Michael Palmer (both of whom I can't stand) in terms of plot. Overall, I don't recommend it."
5,Perry has done it again!,"I have been waiting for Thomas Perry's book and to my surprise found it in a local bookstore. I was disappointed that it was not a Jane Whitehead novel, but he more than made up for that by crafting a tight plot about likeable people that you're really sympathetic to,even though--well, anyway, it's a great thriller, and I sat up to finish reading it until 3:00 AM. I strongly recommend it! pph30@aol.com"
1,Zero,"How has this nil plot, nil writing, infinite bore has ever been published is a sad testimony of US publishing and book reviewing."
4,zanta,The book was as new. Clean near perfect. Very satisfied but a bit expensive.Best used book I've ever bought.
3,not as entertaining as his past work,Thomas Perry--He lives in Calif. with his wife and2 daughters. 383 pages-2001- Random House.My favorite Perry books are the JANE WHITEFIELD &BUTCHER BOY SERIES.Max Stillman- fraud investigator for McClaren Life andCasualty. Wonders if Walker was in on the fraud.Walker 24-MC employee. Had affair with the womanemployee accused of paying out a huge death benefiton some one who was not dead.Ellen Snyder--missing after paying claim.Book is slow going and not up to Perry's usual standards.Makes to much of a previous relationship.A DEADLY CONSPIRACY..old and evil.New Hampshire.The book is really about the relationship between Stillmanand Walker.I bought a 2nd & -3rd Perry book-PURSUIT & DEAD FISH at thesame time I bought this.I dont think I will buy any more. I'll just re-read Jane andButcher Boy over again. .bbp okc 63 retired
5,It Even Makes Insurance Company&#65533;s Seem Exciting,"John Walker works as a data analyst for McLaren Life and Casualty, a respected insurance company, when a mysterious character named Stillman, to help investigate the disappearance of one of the company's sales people, enlists him. Not only had the salesperson disappeared, but also, so had a significant payout, $12 million to be exact.Once they hit the road, the thrill of the chase really takes hold. Thomas Perry gives us a very interesting insight into what it takes to try to find someone who doesn't wish to be found. This is in stark contrast to his Jane Whitefield series in which we come at the problem from the side of the person trying to evade capture.Apart from a small lull in the action upon arriving in New Hampshire, the book was compelling reading with problem after problem needing to be solved. As it turned out, the small lull in New Hampshire was just an opportunity for me to get my breath back before the real fireworks began."
5,Very tense & entertaining,"A nice mix of whodunit-howdoneit puzzle and a thriller where a private investigator teams up with an insurance analyst to try and track down who is defrauding a moderately successful insurance company. The hunt takes them from San Francisco to Los Angeles where it peters out as the two investigate the possible murder or disappearance of a young woman insurance agent and former girlfriend of the analyst. It picks up again in Florida. Lots of interesting insights into the life insurance business. The final chapters in small town New Hampshire are very tense as the insurance agents are holed up, high in a church bell tower as their criminal pursuers get closer and closer."
3,perry is coasting and reusing a compe best material for this,"ok, some great ideas, recycled plots and scenarios from his earlier books, lame ending, still perry is great and I will continue to buy his books, next one is supposed to be better, pursuit!"
1,DEATH BENEFITS SHOULD BE DENIED!,"I am an insurance fraud investigator, so I was excited about this novel and couldn't wait to read it. Oh, but what a terrible dissappointment it turned out to be!The characters were unreal; the plot was weak; the narration was disorganized. It was slow, boring and basically a waste of my time. At times it read like a survelliance report on the characters' activity.In the real world of insurance fraud, law enforcement and trained fraud investigators would have been all over this case----not some shady mystery man assisted by an insurance analyst!I recommend reading absolutely ANYTHING other than this. I swear your local telephone book would be more interesting and exciting. Trust me! Save your money...."
2,Disappointing,I loved Butcher's Boy and immediately picked up Death Benefit expecting or wishing for a reprise. The beginning of it was equal. Walker the inexperienced analyst and Stillman the experienced detective work together and find the body of Ellen Snyder. As in other Perry book's the characters are interesting.The second section of the book is almost painful to read. The never ending stay in the small town in New Hampshire was uninteresting. I also have trouble figuring out what really happened. If someone want to explain this to me please send me an E Mail.Others have enjoyed these books so I will not give away too much. All I can say is that I have read three Perry books now and 2 our of 3 were good so I will give it a try.
3,decent.,"Done by Masami Obari, the man behind Fatal Fury, Battle Arena Toshinden is yet another fighting game-based anime. The action scenes are okay as usual with Obari's work, and the dub is, well, what you'd expect from a dub. The story was flat out average, although I do admit there were a few good parts. On the minus side, the climax was pretty generic and turned out to be disappointing. The uncut version features a nice scene with Sofia in the shower, but shoddy artwork ruins it. Uh, anyway, despite those flaws, Toshinden is an above average fighting anime. If you're into action anime or Obari's work, then buy it, if you can't see it first."
5,Excellent,"Battle Arena Toshinden is based off the short lived Fighting game that was here in America (and was part of the Playstation opening lineup). In the Anime it is about Eiji searching out his brother SHo. In the Meantime the Organization (Run by Uranus) is trying to gather Data on the Toshinden Warriors in order to create the ultimate killing machine. To battle the ORganization Eiji, Kayin, Sofia, Tracey and Gaia all team up to take the organization down after they attack and put in the hoispital Ellis.The fight sequences are typcial Anime but still real cool to watch (if you are into Action Anime). It fits right in if you are a Fan of Street Fighter, Tekken, or Fatal Fury. IT will not appeal to everyone because it is more about the fights than plot but than again most bond films are the same way and no one complains. THis is a decent anime that is worth watching at least once (or owning like I do)."
4,Great Anime.,"Really goes deep into the Toshinden series, from Kayin and his father's death, to Gaia and his secret daughter Ellis. I wouldn't recommend this for children under 13 years of age, because of the violence. Otherwise, a wonderful well made anime. I rank this a 4 star movie."
1,Not so great,"I have owned this product for over a year, but it only worked for a few months. The pump still works, but it doesn't work well for creating CO2. I followed the instuctions and each time it would work for about a week to a week and a half, then start making this horrible noise. I think there was not enough CO2 being generated for the pump. I kept the pump on the lowest setting, but it would still start making the noise if it was hooked to the bottle. I had a 6 pack of the sugar, and so I used it as long as that lasted. I am now looking for a better CO2, I would not waste your money on this one."
1,poor quality,"The silver overlay is peeling off upon opening the item. My daughter loves the design so much, she doesn't want me to return it."
2,Dont wash in washing machine!,"This are nice shoes, but when I washed them in the washing machine, (I always wash this kind of shoes in washing machine, and never had problems), the plastic parts (faux leather) turn from black to white."
4,Gummy Frogs Ribbit Ribbit,"These gummy frogs taste like apple, they're about an inch a piece, and they're soft. I enjoy these little frogs much more than those mini multi colored ones, these are the real deal, however you cannot eat a lot of them otherwise you'll have stomach problems. Overall they are one of the better Haribo Products."
2,A barely edible frog,"I disagree with the other Haribo fans on this product page. These frogs are not particularly tasty. The reason? The white stuff at the bottom of each ""frog"". No idea what it's called, but it doesn't taste good. Frankly, it tastes like frog!Only two stars for you this time, Mr. Haribo.Otherwise, this product line is excellent. What do you think I consume when I'm writing these meaningless and cheap Amazon reviews?;-)Forget about these barely edible frogs, and go for the gummi bears, Schnuller or Tropi-Frutti instead!"
1,made my teeth itch,"made my teeth itch, so sugary it was sickening. I had to give them away. I feel bad for whoever gets them"
2,Not as good as Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,"I enjoyed Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell because it was so unique. It was a slow read at times but made up for it with some fascinating characters placed in an alternate history where magicians work with the military to fight Napoleon. This collection of short stories however, I found odd, boring and very very slow to move through. Just didn't capture my attention. I read another four books while forcing myself to finish this one. I give it two stars which to me means save your money. I didn't like this one for the most part. One story reminded me a bit of Strange and Norrell and that is Tom Brightwind. Amazon recommeded ""His Majesty's Dragon"" to me because I enjoyed JS and Mr. Norrell. I enjoyed reading about the English using talking dragons to fight Napoleon. If you are looking for something similar to JS and Mr. Norrell, you might look there."
3,Like a Jonathan Strange appetizer...,"Since I won't ever shut up about how magnificent Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is and how it ought to be required reading in the civilized world, a friend bought me this book for my birthday. I enjoyed it, but It feels like exactly what it is: stories set in the same world as Jonathan Strange to tide over the fan base and capitalize on JS's success. The stories work to varying degrees of effectiveness, but I thought that only one (""Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower"") was truly excellent. If you've read JS, this book may tide you over but in a vaguely unsatisfying way. If you haven't read JS, this book will hopefully whet your appetite for the main course."
2,Not what I expected,"I loved the narration. Davina Porter has a lovely voice and beautiful expression. However, it seems as though ""the other stories"" were just thrown in. The title story was very good, but the others were less than expected."
1,Where is the magic??,"I stopped listening to the audiobook after the first three stories or so, I couldn't detect much unusualness nor magic. However, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention."
4,Kindle edition is horrid,"Wish I could get my money back. While the stoies are great, though a bit less absorbing than her previous book, the kindle edition is horrible. Mispellings abound and the illustrations don`t come out right, but most disappointing is the lack of section divisions that make it extremely confusing! Very disappointed."
4,Don't get the Kindle version!,"The content of this book is wonderful, however the Kindle version is rife with typos and errors. There are I's instead of K's, 7's randomly following the letter Y, and various instances of two keys being pressed instead of the intended one. A few typos can be expected in a long work, but the frequency with which they happen in the Kindle version of this book are honestly jarring.I do not know if the printed version has been edited with more scrutiny, but I imagine that it must have been."
5,Fabulous Modern Fables,Sussana Clarke is a brilliant writer. The Ladies of Grace Adieu bridge the cap between Fay and reality in a most marvelous retro-Victorian way. I Love it!
1,Kindle edition review,"Do not buy this book for Kindle, the editing is so poor that it becomes effectively unreadable. I have found this to be a slight problem with other ebooks but never so bad as this. I will try to obtain a refund."
3,A brief comment on the Kindle edition...,"I first read The Ladies of Grace Adieu in hardcover many years ago and enjoyed it greatly. Unfortunately, I've found that the Kindle edition is simply sloppily edited. While readable, typos do abound. This becomes a particular problem for a book that frequently employs unorthodox or antiquated spellings. I love my Kindle, but I would have appreciated more care from the editors responsible for this version."
5,great reference for basic understanding of the fishes,"this book was written by the great Al Mcclane, who parallels l. Ron Hubbard as an author, and if fish were an alien race, he would have an international cult of his own. Good book."
5,Life saver for a fussy baby!,"I tried 2 baby carriers before investing in this wonderful gift from God. I bought a peanut sling(baby hated it!),a Moby Wrap(mom hated it- way too aggravating and difficult to put on!) My hubby and I ventured to babies R Us. I chose this over the Bjorn carrier(which sells for way more) not because of price but because where the legs go there is a padded cushion in the Jeep one whereas there is only plastic on the Bjorn. (Ouch!) My daughter and I both love it. It's easy to put on and take off and she's really comfortable in it. I only wish I had seen it in pink. :-)"
3,Louisiana History,"The fact that I was in New Orleans while reading part of this book added to the experience. It is a history of that city and being on location provided a visual element that not everyone can enjoy unless they make the trip.This book is somewhat straightforward as a historical work. It isn't necessarily colorful or instructive. It's just there. Cable describes the setting, the people, the controveries surrrounding a given location and time.If you want to know more about the people who developed the city of New Orleans and how it resulted in some of the mindset there today, this book may provide some answers."
4,70 años peerless una historia musical,"i like this kind of music, and this artist long time ago i don't listen any thing."
3,Um...,"Preconceived notions of each other, a pregnancy, and time alone to discover what they had wrong about each other. Normally this would be a four star book, however the mother alone leaves me still shaken with her behavior and takes away hope for a truly happy future.... I have never been so ambivalent or unsure if I liked or disliked a book"
2,Tired of this stuff,"I bought this stuff hoping that it would be just as good as what I used to use. For a short time Degree made a spray anti-perspirant that was called Powerc (same can, different name). I have been unable to find this anymore in a spray can, so I bought this Sport brand instead. I HATE this stuff. This stuff has stained my shirts, and has done nothing for perspiration. I don't know how something can be labeled anti-perspirant when it does nothing to that effect. I am not going to use this stuff anymore, if I can not find the Power spray I will most likely give up all together on Degree!"
5,Gets more than regular floss,"I was amazed at what this little flosser found between my teeth. Regular floss just didn't seem as effective. I'd like a waxier floss, but it's so effective, it's hard to be critical. I love it!"
3,Great for tooth care - but short lifetime,"I purchased this to replace by gum stimulator, because I could not get replacement tips for it. I was thrilled with both the flosser and the pick. They work very well. The only problem is after about 3 months the unit stopped working. I replaced the battery - it wasn't that. Thinking I just got a bad unit I bought another one. Now after about 3 months this one is doing the same thing! Sometimes when you press the button it doesn't run. I have to tap it on the countertop or shake it to get it started. I don't want to buy a new one every three months.PS. I soak the flosser and the pick in antiseptic mouthwash overnight so I can reuse them for a week or more."
5,great invention,"Im glad I didnt let all these bad reviews of this product keep me from buying it. I think its fantastic. At first glance the whole idea of a vibrating flosser may seem a little over the top and silly but guess what, it works. I can totally feel it cleaning out all the nasty grime inbetween my teeth. Its easy to use, its extremely effective, I gotta give it what it deserves. 5 stars"
1,save your money,"Purchased thinking it would be supperior to manual flossing and it is actually worse! Not worth the time, effort and definetly money."
1,"Hmmm, its not worth the money","We bought the hummingbird flosser, I took the head off of it and used it. Works fine that way, it's good for reaching the back teeth compared to regular dental floss. But I will not buy again. I will just stretch the fingers with regular floss for now on. I am not sure why anyone would say it hurts though it hardly moves."
1,Oh My.,This is one of the worst oral hygene products I have ever used. They try to make it cute and stuff with the minty picks and protective cover and all. I really regret buying this product.
2,Depends on your teeth...,"This product is somewhat of a waste of time depending on your teeth. Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss/pick in between your teeth and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand. Also, I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight (which I doubt everyones is) I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is."
1,This Flosser Could Damage Your Dental Work,"If you are considering the Hummingbird flosser, don't! I tried it, and it practically pulled a crown out. The floss tips are too tight, and the tiny flosser is a nightmare to hold.On the other hand, the Reach flosser is about the size of an electric toothbrush, and very easy to hold. Moreover, the Hummingbird floss-head refills cost almost twice as much as the Reach refills."
1,A Useless Item,"The Oral B Hummingbird is completely useless as a floss or toothpick replacement. The picks and flosser heads are better used without the hummingbird if anything. If you purchase this item you will simply be recieve a device with a ""cute"" appearance that vibrates like a pager but does nothing to help clean your teeth. Honestly, I do not recommend anyone purchasing this product unless they want to use it as a display item on your desk."
1,Very Dissappointed,"I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do. It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth. I guess I'll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works. If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser."
3,Not made for what I need,"This item does not vibrate as much as I thought it would. The vibrations may be beneficial once it gets between the teeth, but they do not help at all in getting the floss into the space between the teeth if your teeth are as close as mine."
2,too hard to use,"I bought one for me and one for my wife. We both feel it is too hard to get in between the teeth...the floss is just too wide. The floss is probably twice the thickness of the reach flosser or even string floss. Also, you have to hold the button down the entire time to use it."
2,"good idea, very poor execution","I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it."
5,Hummingbird addict!,"This is a great product and my oral hygenist has remarked on how healthy my gums are. I've been using the hummingbird (the flossers, not the picks) for two years now and I was dismayed to discover that it has been discontinued in Australia. I'm now buying the flosser refills from America. I sincerely hope the bird isn't given the bird there too."
2,Defective design - breaks every month or 2,"I hate flossing, and this little device is very good. It is easy to use (yes, pressing and holding that button is a pain but you'll get use to it), and it fits nicely between my tight teeth.BUT, and this is one big but, I have go through at least 6-8 of them in the last year. It somehow stops working after about 1 or 2 months. I use to think it's the moisture as it may not be totally waterproof. But now, with the latest one, I just think it's a bad design. Still, I am hostage to this device as this is the only flosser that I would use.I am experimenting with other ones... Hopefully the Reach is at least as good and more durable."
3,"Works well, ergonomically poor","The product is innovative, the flosser makes it easier to floss hard to reach areas but is ergonomically quite poor. My hand starts to cramp by the time I'm half-way done, mostly because of the odd placement of the button -- you need to hold it down for the vibrating action to work.I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it works better than regular floss and the non-moving floss kits in hard to reach areas."
3,Sousa,I love Sousa marches but this recording while comprehensive and cheep lacks much to be desired in the musical rendension. It lacks the spark and musicality of Sousa.
5,fall into reality,"Shapiro's book is an excellent overview on the major trends in US regarding methodology in social science. This book's aim is to stress the importance of not ignoring the reality and empirical evidence when producing the theories in social science. Shapiro dared to say what majority of students think and this book can serve as a starting point for everyone who is starting PhD research and it is confused whether to choose quantitative or qualitative approach. In summary, Shapiro advocates more liberal and creative approach to studying contemporary world."
1,AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE US REGION CODE DVDS!!,"This would be great and I have tried and tried to get this dvd in the advertised US region 1 code. Problem is all of the amazon stock and at least 2 other sellers only have the other code product. I have ordered this 4 TIMES thru amazon and have yet to get a region 1 code for the USA. DON'T FALL FOR THE ADVERTS, ITS NOT CODE 1!!!! SENDING 4TH one back today, I've tried"
1,Would be great...,"if it played in my DVD player. Amazon has is listed as being region 1. When I received my disk, I looked at the back and it stated region 2,3,4,5. Where was the region 1 disk that I ordered???Buyer beware. If you enjoy returning orders, this is the DVD for you!!! Enjoy."
5,One of the funniest books ever written,When I read Chapter 13 of this book where he describes the scene in Paris where 'Ferguson' is eating his breakfast and generally ripping them off as he pretends to guide them to the Louvre I had to put the book down because I was giggling and laughing so hard. Even now when I reread it for the 100th time it never gets old. Anyone who feels Twain was racist doesn't get how universally he applies his satire.
3,It takes real work to ruin Mark Twain,"Narrator has an annoyingly affected voice and manner, seems unfamiliar with the material, and pauses so often, so unexpectedly and so long, it's as if he's taking brief naps in the middle of sentences. He may think he's acting. He sounds like he's losing his place.It's not Twain's best, but it is a funny book. This reading is just annoying."
5,Great Descriptive Writing,"I regard Innocents Abroad as one of the best books I, an avid reader, have read in eighty years of being able to read. Over the years I have checked this book out of whatever library system I resided. I have probably read it at least six time cover-to-cover. His humor is matched by his ability to describe whatever he is writing about so vividly that one can visualize his object of attention.When I finally visited Europe in my fifties, sixties, and seventies my mental pictures of the cities he described were confirmed.rfb"
3,Funny but Parochial,"I am generally a fan of Mark Twain but was disappointed in this book for a few reasons. He traveled on this famour voyage to Europe and the Middle East when he was still a young man, and the humor is sometimes on the juvenile side. He is often making fun of people's eating habits and clothing, and his comfort or lack of comfort at many points along the road form the subject of much of his material. He makes a lot of comments about the nature of the beast that he is riding at the time be it horse, camel or donkey; but while he anthropomorisizes the animals, he seems to not have been able to communicate with the humans he meets. Few conversations with native people or guides are evident and he does not seem to have been able to understand the cultures he visits in any depth. The strength of this book is his impressionistic visual descriptions of places before they were transformed by technology after the late 19th century."
2,innocents abeoad,"The description of this book was like new. when I receive the book it was old, yellow, and aged that it begin that it begin to fall apart. I was disappointed it did not fit the description the buyer provided."
1,Arrogance Revisited,"The book is nothing more than the arrogance of American pilgrims or travelers looking and sounding superior to ""foreigners."" I could not get through it and I don't regret it."
1,Twain Deserves Better,"This is a great book, but the Signet version is a disgrace to Twain's memory -- cheap paper, messy undersized print, and narrow margins all make reading it torture.Do yourself a favor and buy the Modern Library version instead:The Innocents Abroad: or, The New Pilgrims' Progress (Modern Library Classics). You'll end up buying it anyway."
3,"OK, but a little disappointed","I very much enjoyed Twain's book ""Following the Equator"", so I thought I'd also enjoy this book. But after having it for a month, I haven't even read 100 pages. Maybe I'm just in a different space now, but this book just doesn't seem nearly as interesting."
1,The Innocents Abroad,"The edition I received was just Volume 1. I Thought I had purchased the entire book. Hence I was gravely disappointed to receive only half the book. I explained the problem to ""returns"" and they said to package and return it for a refund, so that I could reorder the COMPLETE book. However, I was sent the SAME, Volume 1, edition again. I still have not been able to read the second half of the book and I'm about to give up on amazon.com.Mary Moloney"
5,Excellent!,"Twain's two most familiar travelogues are collected here in a handsome Library of America edition. Roughing It is by far my favorite. In it we sense the limitless possibilities of 19th century America. Twain is by turns an assistant to his brother (the Secretary of Nevada Territory), a gold miner, a journalist, and a traveller in the Pacific. The Innocents Abroad, while still good, is more labored than Roughing It - it is clear that Twain was more fertile when writing about his native soul.A word about the Library of America editions - if you are interested at all in America's literary heritage, you can't do better than buying these editions. Most are comprehensive, are well-bound, and are durable."
4,"revealing, pleasant read","John Wooden is one of my heroes. When I was growing up, his teams were dominant, but more importantly, they made the game beautiful to watch. After he retired at the peak of his game, he quietly stepped off the stage. With the rush of books on leadership in the 1990's through the present, it was inevitable, and overdue, that folks take time to examine Coach Wooden's approach to leadership. This has led to a cottage industry in Wooden books.This book is short, personal and focuses on life lessons learned from the narrative of Coach's life. It doesn't attempt to be weighty, just a good read, that imparts wisdom without hitting you over the head with it. It touches on each chapter of Coach Wooden's life, and particularly shows the infuence of his father, his high school and college coaches and his growth thru experienceThis is a fun, easy read that leaves the reader wiser. Highly recommend"
5,Old School Wisdom,"This isn't a book about basketball, but about the foundations of success; not just for a team of ball-players, but for a family, an organization, and even a nation. There is a great deal of wisdom contained in these few pages."
4,"Short, but Very Good","I loved the book, but I would have liked for it to be longer. It is a very quick read but is full of wisdom from one of the best coaches of all time."
4,Take the time to learn it...,Take the time to learn the game system before trashing it. The printed manual (which is getting increasingly rare these days) clearly states that new players should spend about 2-3 hours going through the tutorials.Do not buy this game if you're expecting flashy graphics. Do buy it if you want a game to truly challenge you.My only complaint(s) with the manual are the very dark illustrations & tiny printing. Otherwise it's well laid out & pretty well written.
2,Works but be careful,"I also had an issue with irritated skin in the area where I had used the product. I had some itchy areas which when scratched a little peeled off and started bleeding. I felt like the Fly movie and my face was coming apart. I was afraid that I had cancer or something! Basically, try not to get much on your skin below the hair (which isn't easy) and probably limit the time that it is on. I had used it a couple of times before with only minor irritation, but this time I let it get on my skin too much I think. The coloring of the hair itself works pretty good."
1,Bad tube caps - lots of wastage,"For over a year now, the caps on the 2 tubes have been found defective. Sometimes they do not open at all. Had to return several of them. I learnt the hard way... For some more experiences on the caps of the tubes.....On one ocassion I used force and the whole tube twisted. When I used excessive force, the cap opened and the gel spurted out, wasting half of the contents. On another ocassion, the cap cracked and would not close. As a result, the contents were exposed to air and got black (spoilt). Had to throw it out.This is otherwise a good product. However, the manufacturer should not resort to cheap tricks that cause wastage just to improve sales."
1,WARNING: See a professional,"I bought my first batch of this in February. It colored well, although I should have gone a shade lighter. The allergy test went without incident. The box lasted until May, when I bought a replacement.That's where things took a turn. I applied the coloring on a Sunday night. Monday morning, I awoke with swelling on the left side of my mouth, and an oozing sore above my upper lip. At first, I thought I had picked up a skin disease but discovered by searching on the web that a change in the chemical formula brings on such a reaction to many users.I quit using the product immediately, however I am still suffering side effects today - three months later. The swelling on one side has never completely disappeared and the area where I suffered the oozing burned away some of my facial hair.Should I decide to recolor my facial hair I will swallow my pride and have it done by a pro. Otherwise, I will follow my doctor's advice and look distinguished."
2,Short life of color. Never lasts for 3 applications.,"I been using this product for a while now. 1st of all, the color fades fast. Even though the packaging says it's supposed to last for multiple applications i.e. about 3, it doesn't. I can only get about 2. the thing is really hard to mix because they put a riser in the middle of the mixing tray, God knows why... it doesn't make any sense. Is it just so I can see which half is which? Since I'm supposed to put one cream on one side and the other on the other? How stupid do you think I am that I need an actual raised plastic line to see where half of the tray is? the thing also stinks like mad and if you drop it on anything it will stain it permanently."
3,An interesting look into Shamanism,"Vitebsky may have not put together a masterpiece with this book, however there is a multitude of excellent information within its pages. The book covers shamanism cross culturally, so you get a taste of shamanism in Siberia (where it first originated) Africa, South American, North America, and many others. Some of the information in the text may be a little dated or flawed, but if you are someone who is just getting interested in the area of shamanism I highly recommend it. The text is easy to read, has vivid pictures, isn't too dry or boring, and doesn't spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one thing in particular. In short it's a fun and interesting educational read."
3,Serious but sweet,"John Boles is as talented and handsome as ever. This is a serious movie, but it has a great story line that captures a father and son learning the importance of love and working on keeping their relationship intact."
2,Enough with the CG allready,"Most anime out there is using a lot of CG. Some of them pull it off very nicely like Cowboy Bebop and Blue Submarine No. 6. But this has to be the worst anime ever made with CG in it. When watching the flying boats I though ""Ok, just a little bad CG"". Then the battle scenes came. This is where the CG is the worst. The boats explode entirely wrong and its unbearable. But where CG fails, 2D animation comes in, right? Wrong. Even the 2D animation is horrible. If you looking for an anime based on a video game, buy Sakura Wars or Tekken instead of waisting $10 on this piece of crap anime."
1,"Could've been better, too short","This movie was way too short, only 35 minutes, Its about this guy who's chasing a dragon because the dragon kidnapped his girlfriend. While this is happening there is almost no storyline evolving through out the story. The dubbing was the worst I have ever heard and the animation was stiff. If you're an anime fan, do not get this movie!"
3,A Sequel to Possessions,"At first, I was really disappointed with this book because it turns out that it is the sequel to _Possessions_. No where on the book's cover, or inside flaps is this pivotal fact mentioned. I had to look it up online to figure out why something felt missing... And since the ending of _Possessions_ is definitively given away in this sequel, I am not really in any rush to go back and read it. Maybe someday...That aside, I did enjoy this book quite a bit. The narration was refreshing and the characters were likable. The end also seems pretty open-ended, so I will keep an eye out for a third book in this series. There were a lot of gaps in the plot, but it didn't bother me too much, since this book was mostly all about excitement."
1,Quite a stretch,"I would suggest this book for new horror readers under the age of 25. Lots of loose ends even for a series book. It had some slightly scary parts but not much to leave to the imagination. You can go from Moore to Koontz but not the other way around. Being an avid Koontz fan, this was rather flat."
3,"Average item, good features but weak plastic","I've had one of these CD players for nearly two years. The two levels of bass boost and are nice along with the various modes and expected play features we've all come to expect. But, one thing that annoyed me was the plastic hook on the lid (which depresses a trigger so the player knows the CD lid is closed and will play) is pretty thin. It broke off after 8 months. Being cheap I fashioned a repair (I jammed plastic into the hole to push the trigger down always). Still, this is not designed to take to many bumps and jolts."
1,Oh My God!!!,I never bought this but come on! It just looks horrible - and Franklin?! I recommend buying from Besta - they specialize in Chinese translators.The ones that have the touch screen pens are very useful.
2,Re-recorded and/or Re-mixed Commercial Versions,"All of the songs here were re-recorded and/or remixed. I personally prefer the originals. The songs have been changed to emphasize an extra-punchy, mainstream, pop aesthetic. The bonus songs all lean toward this style even further with no trace of their original, wonderful, '80s psychedelic pop sound."
1,Carmen-no libretto,I was very disappointed when I received the opera and there was no libretto with it. This is the only time in my life I have purchased an opera and it has not contained the libretto.
3,"so, so,","I like carmen's famous music. this cd have not some thig i think.I recomend another carmen,del monaco's carmen or something.but this cd is funny in another. oftenly there is french words .it's so good french prononciation"
4,excellent recording but not perfect,"The biggest problem with this recording is that the dialogues are spoken by french actors instead of the singers. As a result, the dialoges sound very artificial.Other then that- this is an excellent recording of ""carmen"". Grace Bumbry is a magnificent carmen, KostasPaskalis and mirella freni are very good as Escamilioand micaela. Jon vickers is not my favourite don josestill, he is a fine singer.The conducting is colourful and dynamic.If you don't mind the fake dialoges-this ""carmen""is recommended, especially at this low price."
4,Fun book,Slow Dance: Heart Break Blues is a great book for teens trying to get through life. Many teens would be able to relate to this. I loved all the poems in it and it is just a great book in all. I recommend this to teens just trying to get through life.
3,Pond Master 500 gpm submersible pump,"Excellent design. would last many years were it not for the fact that the shaft bearings are made of rubber and wear out in little more than one season. Kits are available to replace the rotor with new bearings, but they are pricey"
1,Too too noisy,"While the flow is appropriate for my porch fountain, split to 2 outlets, the noise from this pump is louder than the water flow itself. My thought is that there is something wrong with this particular pump. It's well submerged in water, but sounds like its running dry. I've since turned it off and intend to return it."
5,PORTEZ MON AME AU CIEUX...,"Teaching oneself about opera is not easy. I have been trying and struggling with this for years. But it is clear that Faust is one of the most popular operas of all time. Of the countless recorded versions available, I have purchased about five, and of them, this is by far the best. It is sheer heaven to listen to this entire opera, no exaggeration. The most marvelous moment occurs near the end when Mephistopheles, Faust, and Marguerite are singing together with an amazing, powerful and harmonius culmination, and Marguerite pleads for her soul. Mephistopheles pronounces, ""Jugée!"" and a choir of angels contradicts him, ""Sauvée!""A beautiful and moving version of an unforgettable story."
1,worst recording ever,The singers are quite accomplished but the recording is so bad that I refuse to listen to it. I would not recommend this recording.
3,A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GETS REVENGE,"even though critics lambasted this movie when it first was released and considered purely exploitative, I liked it.Yes it had a poorly written script; but that was what Margaux and Mariel Hemingway had to deal with. They both held the movie together and it gives an early glimpse into the world of modeling and sexual predators.Even after all these years this movie is still relevant and I really liked that a very beautiful woman got revenge. BULLSEYE."
1,Not the same as we remembered it,This movie seemed to be edited from the original one we saw when it was released.
1,"Make yourself a favor, resist any temptation to watch it!","A thrashed portrait about a model who is molested by a composer. I can still remember it as one of the worst films I have watched in my life. Terrible edition, predictable script and infamous performances. This was the worst film in which Anne Bancroft appeared ever.Do not waste your time watching it as I did it; one of my youth's sins."
4,Guilty pleasure.,"Lipstick starring Margaux Hemingway, Mariel Hemingway, and Chris Sarandon is a strange film about rape. Margaux was not exactly the best actress in the world but boy she was one beautiful lady. Her real-life kid sister, Mariel had the acting gene but Lipstick is so bad, it's good! The rape scene is difficult to watch of course, but the way the court system attacks women who have been raped is just horrible and realistic I am embarrassed to say. I give this film 4 stars because of the amazing, unexpected ending - Margaux Hemingway in a gorgeous red dress gunning down her rapist, Hollywood magic at its finest. Definitely a guilty pleasure all the way, enjoy this glossy trash!"
5,Destroyers are awesome,"It's a nice little addition to your Necron army, (remember, you need at least three to a squad in order to use them). Since it's considered a jetbike you may move it 12 inches and still be able to fire its excellent Heavy 3 Strength 6 AP 4 weapon. They're good at taking out potential threats to the C'tan (If you have one) ripping infantry apart, glancing even the most powerful of tanks and penetrating lightly armored ones, and taking out heavy infantry. They have a 3+ armor save and benefit from ""we'll be back"". So get as much destroyers as you can, they'll come in handy a lot."
3,Recorded too late,"I wish that I could speak more highly of this performance, as it was made by some of my favorite singers (and conductor). Alas, I can not. Milnes is a fine Figaro. Sills (I love her) should have recorded this role about 10 years earlier. Really unfortunately, I found Gedda's work painful. A fine, stylish tenor in his prime, he is well past it here.Sometimes great talents come together and misfire. But, if you are a Sills fan..."
2,A Misfire,"On paper, this looks like a dream cast, but the reality proves unfortunate. BVeverly Sills, Nicolai Gedda and Sherril Milnes are some of my favorite singers, but here, Sills sounds fatigued (though her ""Un Vene Poco fa"" is charming and winsome), Milnes misses the finese of Figaro, and Gedda, sad to say, sounds old and tired. Renato Cappecchi is a miscast Bartolo, but Raimondi is an imposing Bartolo, if without the nuances that Zaccaria brings to the role or the sheer glee Ramey and Montarsolo do. Levine's tempi are plodding, and Fedora Barbieri shows up in a cameo as Bertha, compleatly ill-equiped. If it were not for Sill (who can do no real wrong) and Raimondi, I wouldn't even bother looking at it. 2/5"
3,Rissini-in Black and White,"I was really looking forward to a rousing ""Barber"" and I enjoyed it very much. The recording doesn't have the robust audio that I was hoping to hear because it apparently was done without the benefit of current technology and hasn't been remastered."
3,Good starting place - Not the best though,"This is a great bargain deal if you want to hear the music from this opera. Is this a great performance? No, it is not. The strongest part of this recording is the conducting, great pacing all the way through. The worst part is Milnes AWFUL falsetto note in Largo al factorum. How the hell did this make it on the final product? Horrible, sounds like a teenage boy. Other than that, it is decent."
3,Slight confusion,"This is not a review, just a comment that one reviewer seems to have transposed Gedda from Count to Figaro and vice versa for Milnes.Although I can't comment on the performance, the system requires that I star rate it to register a comment, so I cautiously enter 3. No doubt it deserves better."
1,Tedious and Disappointing,"After listening to this CD I had to ask myself what was Louie DeVito thinking? The first song on the CD is a remix of a song on Volume 5: ""In Your Eyes"". Granted it is an amazing song, dramtic, heart pumping and all that - but why did DeVito include it again? Who knows, but unfortunately it is the only good song on CD, what follows is tedious and boring.I have enjoyed over and over again every NYC Underground Party CD until this one - which is just disappointing. And although I have never considered DeVito to be a cutting edge DJ, his previous CD's are fantastic for what they are - mixes of standard, popular dance songs.This CD is so mediocre and I have wonder if it is time for Louie DeVito to find a new line of work."
1,RIP OFF,So this CD has some software on it that doesn't allow you to play it from your computer or put the cd on your ipod. I am extremely disappointed that I paid for something I can't even dictate how I can use. Aren't you supposed to decide for yourself how and where you use an item you pay for.......Don't waste your money the mix isn't that great either!!!!!!!!
2,Totally Disappointed,"If the best song on the cd is a remix of a great song from volume 5, then that is a major problem. Number 1, ""In Your Eyes"", is a great change up from the beat from the earlier album. However, every track after that is not even a factor. I don't know what Louie is doing, but the song quality is horrible. ""No Strings"" does not sound good at all and ""Love on my Mind"" is way too short with not enough of the chorus repeating. The other songs are just plain ordinary to awful. I give it 2 starts because of Luz Devina. ""You Shine on Me"" is a pretty good song, but on here it sounds very rushed. Louie will not get my business anymore. I can't keep paying for mediocrity all the time."
3,Ehh,I thought the whole NYC Underground 1-5 Series were amazing...Vol 6 and 7 were SO-SO...i dont know why but i tried to put in NYC Underground Party Vol. 7 into my computer and my computer wont read it...i wish this CD was a DOUBLE CD such as the other series volume...and i miss the MegaMixes...i surely was disappointed but i will have faith that Louie DeVito will keep what he's doing best
5,Anastasia...funny girl that one,"Anastasia is sure she is going insane so she buys a big statue of Freuds head and talks to it every day.This is a fantastic series,highly recommende buy moi!!(Now,what they decided to do with the gerbils at the end...was that really revenge on Nicky,or was it cruel to the gerbils!!)"
1,Poor gerbils,I agree that gerbils are poorly mistreated in this book. I will not recommend it to anyone.
3,Prepare for Full Dynamics,"This CD offers a very nice slice of Igor's output--it's esp. good to have a complete, original 1910 version of ""The Firebird,"" (thought I'll admit to being a little disappointed with the rendering of that great, whirling passage in the Introduction that must have been pinched for the opening bar of the ancient ""Batman"" TV series...).And it's a good value for two discs.But be warned: the recording sounds excellent, but it is done with ""full dynamic range""; I have to double the volume to hear the quiet passages, and then the loud moments become earth-shaking. Yes, I've tried both discs in multiple stereo systems. I don't mind this kind of fully-immersed listening from time to time, but it is not always convenient, and this disc suffers for that. I hope the very pure are not dissuaded by this complaint--I salute you for supporting the producer's boldness, and ignoring this listener's timidity."
5,Great Book..!!,"This book is very informative, well written and very interesting, I have not read the whole thing yet, but from what I read so far, I am pleased. I especially like all the business tips, it allows you to have a FULL understanding of what it all takes to start your own business, and not only start it, but ensure its success. This book is straight forward and will give it to you how it is, all the while being written in a way that you feel like you are in a conversation, versus just reading. Great job..!!"
4,Lots Of Things To Think About,"This books gets to the point on a long list of aspects involved with being a professional photographer. Good idea to get this book before starting a business, read it, and while you read, make a checklist of what applies to your situation. With your list in hand, you can start analyzing and re-shaping your business concept.For panoramic, stereoscopic and infrared photography I recommend this book:Panoramic & Stereoscopic Photography In Color And Infrared: A Step By Step Guide"
3,Lots of good information but a very dry book.,"This book contains a lot of infomation on how to get started on photography from a business perspective- However a lot of the chapters are taken from other books. Also it is very dry reading- kinda like reading a text book, its stuff you should know but you probably take a few naps before you actually finish the book."
2,"""Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma""","To whomever stole the guts from Wes Nisker's original 1990 publication titled, ""Crazy Wisdom"" could you kindly return them?With the original version out of print, I bought this one as a gift.Alas, when this sad imposter arrived, I searched the pages for my favorite chapters and quotes but found that, even the tricksters were missing from this dummed down version. Like Chicken Soup for the Souless. How sad."
5,Early John Rutter,"This collection first introduced John Rutter to most of us. The recordings were made 30 years ago, when Rutter, in his early 20's, was directing the choir at Clare College. This was a big hit when it was first released on LP. In fact, for the first couple of years, if you didn't buy the LP early in the season, you could forget it. The record store would be sold outThe unique Rutter choral sound was apparent from the first, particularly on his own compositions: Shepherd's Pipe Carol and Nativity Carol. Now, many years and several recordings later, Rutter's work has lost none of its beauty or appeal."
5,As only Rutter can do them,"John Rutter's is my favorite music for Christmas. For me, this CD is the most beautiful rendition ever of his music. I highly recommend this and his other CD's to lift your spirts and bring peace to your heart and home at Christmas. Jean in DE"
1,GE Mini Cassette Voice Recorder,Buyers and sellers must understand that there is a difference between Micro and Mini Cassette tapes. I am looking specifically for a mini recorder as I have some valuable old mini cassettes to transcribe but do not have a machine to do it with. The micro cassette is a slightly smaller tape and the mini tapes will not fit into the micro machine. The mini machines were mostly used to take dictation in an office setting and new they can be very expensive. This GE was advertised as a Mini Voice Recorder but actually was a micro and I had to go to the trouble of sending it back to the seller. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is excellent and much appreciated. I have had to use it a couple of times before on different products without complications. Thank you amazon.
4,good for the price,"very reasonable for its price. quite clear recordings, although they are certainly not crystal. mine will occasionally stop while recording, and requires a slight tap to keep going, but for my purposes this isn't that troubling, and i did purchase it used."
5,You should feel guilty at this price,"This recital disc of Slavonic Opera Arias is an absolute treat - Lucia Popp in the repetoire of her homeland. As you would expect, she excels herself, her voice is at once beautiful, subtle, inflected, and passionate - a shimmering, soaring soprano. Of course her pronunciation and sympathy with her native language cannot be faulted.At bargain price this is one of those discs you should feel guilty paying so little for. I am not aware of any worthwhile comparisons at any price. Treat yourself to a guilt trip today!"
1,......,"... This book is a ""mess"". If you are a beginner and want to learn Coldfusion - DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY! No supporting database samples to download, code has typo, the author said he can't find the database for Chapter 4-7. What a waste of money....."
2,Marcasite Watch by Geneva,The quality of this watch is very poor. I purchased the same watch a couple of years ago and was very pleased with it. I don't know why the quality has become so poor.
5,UA shirt,Arrived within a short time.Glad you had my size. Most sport stores didn't have an XL in stock.
3,Our Relationships As Viewed by the Devil and his lesser demons,This is hard to read because you ordinarily don't believe that you are doing the Devil's work; even though you are!
5,thought-provoking,This is a great edition of a classic that should be on everyone's list of must-read books. Get it today!
4,Another addition to the old military history library!! :-),"Basically, a great addition to other u-boat books. Like Hitler's U-boat War (two volume set). I recieved this books as a gift. It great if you read other books about u-boats. Any war junky would love the book. You won't be sorry. Lots of nice pictures. Some I've never seen before (go figure). Not a stand alone book.I would buy it with Hitler U-Boat War by Blair Clay (2 books).Great addition. Keep in mind. I'm a WW II (and history) junky!"
1,Not like other Haribo gummis,"Don't order a case of these if you've never had them. I love all the other Haribo gummies I've had (bears, cokes, burgers, etc), but found these weird and didn't enjoy them. I'm probably just not used to crunchy things on my gummies, but I gave the rest of the case away."
3,Flavorful & Sweet,"These are really cute candies. Each drop is wrapped into hundred of crunchy round bits, just like a real berry. Oozing with flavor and enticing aroma. The gummi part is found inside. Although the Haribo bears are my ultimate favorite, I find this one a bit too sweet for the taste."
2,Sorta Stale,"I really love the gummi raspberry candies. These aren't particularly soft or fresh-tasting, and the candy non-pareils [the little beady candies] are a bit too large. Perhaps other Haribo candies are better, but I can't enthusiastically recommend these."
3,Horton Foote's Alone,"This one was ok, but I have seen better. James Earl Jones and Hume Cronynwere both very good in this as always."
2,Where were all the terrorist authors in 1995 ?,"Here, I think Mr. Bond was trying to help a friend, Mr De Felice to publish a book by printing his own name on the cover.The story is not too original, the ""Dumb Arab"" bit has been done to death, and the last thing we need is another writer selling a story about Middle East terrorists.I don't remember so many authors writing about terrorism when the Timothy Mc Veigh blew up a Federal building in Oklahoma City on April of 1995.An amateur effort at best. Lary Bond again show us his ""softer side"" by endorsing this book."
2,Better,"There were at least 2 dimensions to these characters, and the plot held together, however unlikely. Nice action, and a couple of good lines: One, ""I often thought of patience as a deadly sin,"" or something to that end. I'd read it in an airport, but not on a long flight."
3,Good buy,"The setup instructions are fairly vague but common sense should prevail. The only thing I was a little confused over was an ""extra"" piece which wasn't explained - it's a bar you use IF you have a quick release on your rear wheel. You have to use the Minoura piece instead. Since I couldn't figure out where it went, I didn't use it, but later found out what it was for. (didn't need it anyway) Other than that, it's a decent product for a beginner (since I'm a beginner, I can only speak from that perspective)."
3,A Bit Graphic,"Although my daughter and I love Madeline, this particular book was disturbing. Miss Clavel buys Pepito some tools to give him ""an outlet for his energy"" and he builds a guillotine to decapitate chickens! He turns a cat loose in the midst of a pack of dogs and is then attacked by the dogs, resulting in a visit from the doctor. In the end, of course, Pepito changes his ways. But it in no way compensated for the fact that the majority of the story was, at best, dark. I don't tend to be faint of heart when it comes to literature, but this was not appropriate for my 4-year-old."
1,Way too negative...,"The third book in the ""Madeline"" series, this focusses on the wild behavior of Pepito, a troublemaking boy who is meant to be a foil for the mischievous Madeline. The behavior shown is pretty excessive, though: Bemelmans shows the boy tying a cat up in a pillowcase and releasing it into a pack of dogs, which strikes me a way too violent. Certainly not appropriate for smaller (toddler) readers. Even if you liked the other Madeline books, you might want to think twice before picking this one up. It's a little scary."
1,Worst of the Madelines - nothing to recommend it,"The original Madeline is charming, well written, fun for kids of any age. The Bad Hat is none of those things.Other reviewers have commented on the negativity and preschool-unfriendly content, like decapitation. I'm actually not a parent who tries to shelter my 3- and 5-year old from too many things, but even I have to agree there's nothing to recommend this for younger kids.That's not the reason for my 1-star review though; for older kids the content wouldn't be an issue. I just find the poetry to be yucky to read. It doesn't scan, and the rhymes aren't particularly good. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Dr. Seuss, or even by the first Madeline book; but I prefer good poetry to bad, and imho this is just bad."
2,Madeline and the bad hat,"This is my least favorite of the Madeline series actually written by the original author. While full of fun rhymes, the book doesn't particularly hang together - plot sacrificed to rhyme. Did i really want to explain a guillotine to a 4-year-old?"
4,Overall a good set,"Fortunately, ours didn't break during shipment. I am not too crazy about this pattern, but still bought this set just b/c it was the best one available in my price range. They are quite heavy (a bit too heavy for everyday use) and will last a long time. I really like the large bowl and especially the design of the lids! The lids are so light and easy to grab, place and remove. The flat design makes it easy to store in your fridge, which to me is a big plus over those bulky traditional corningware glass lids."
5,Great Disc at UNBELIEVABLY GOOD Price!,"Whether you are just beginning to gather a library and want some staples of the choral music world or have long loved the works on this disc, this cd is an indispensible part of a serious music lover's library. The remastering of these historically memorable performances is first rate. Both main works are done with the reverence to the score and the meaning behind the text that was such a hallmark of David Willcocks illustrious career.I wish that Willcocks would live forever, but if trends tell us anything about the future, his extensive output will probably be re-issued some time after he takes his place with the heavenly choirs--and the price will probably not be so inviting. This disc is a gift at this price and it makes a great gift, too! As a choir director, I have often given it to friends and choir members. It has always been greatly appreciated."
