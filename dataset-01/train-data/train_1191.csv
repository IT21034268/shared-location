3,It could be better,"The sound track for ""On The Town"" didn't work at all. The sound track for the other two was very uneven. Too loud, then too soft. Apparently it was still at theater levels. That should be easily repaired.These wonderful movies are worth a re-do."
4,great gift,"I bought it for a gift. It was perfect. FYI, only 2 movies have spanish subtitles (Singin'.. & American..) the other 2 have only english and french subtitles."
5,Gene Kelly movies,"I bought this set for my sister's birthday, and she screamed when she opened it. She has been a big fan of Gene Kelly and loved all the titles this set includes. This collection contains 'Singin' in the Rain', 'An American in Paris', 'On the Town' and 'Anatiomy of a Dancer'. I am not a fan of musicals, but if you are, this is a set for you. My sister has watched all of these movies at least three times each already, and still loves them like she's never seen them before. Her whole family has grown to love Gene Kelly. She said she highly recommends this to all musical movie lovers!"
5,read the box,"I HAVE SEEN ALL THREE OF THESE MOVIES. THE MOVIES ARE ""FRANTIC. THE FUGITIVE, AND PRESUMED INNOCENT.""THE TITLES ARE LISTED UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. HARD TO SEE, BUT VISIBLE."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this collection which was to include: Frantic, Fugitive and Presumed Innocent. What I got was: Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games--which I had already purchased. I had to return this set and am still waiting for the refund. I was unable to reorder as the item was not available. Not happy as was a requested gift."
5,Great Finish to the Series,"At the end of most episodes you're left wondering what's next, because they leave a situation hanging. We were so glad to have the whole series to hand, to be able to roll from one episode to the next!Smithy has some really touching (albeit tiny) moments with his son as the series progresses and even at the grand sentimental finale of it all the writers still get laughs in, while the characters are being frank and honest.Well written and a satisfying conclusion that will have you smiling. You just want the best for them!"
2,Big Disappointment,"Enjoyed Series 1 and 2 so much, hard to believe this, the third (and final) series, was written by the same people.It's nice to see the familiar, likeable characters;you have to feel for them, given the superficiality of the tired old lines they get to mouth, and the tedious, hackneyed situations they find themselves in.By all means try to catch the first two series, but don't bother with this one."
5,"So funny, Nessa is the best","What's accruing, that lush. Nessa is the best, so blunt. I was wondering if they made a season 4 ?"
2,Simplistic,"I was expecting a good read when I ordered this. I was first let down by the price verses the length of the book. I think you can spend twelve bucks on other books with a great deal more info.I was also let down by the content. The only thing I found interesting about this book is seeing what happened to the JW's after. I think it might have been more interesting to read all the quotes from them one at a time. I found that I had to go back and forth to really get who was who and what they were saying. I somewhat regret the purchase, but am glad to know that all of Tracy's friends and family found that it was beneficial."
3,If Nathan Were Here (Jerome),"In my opinion, this book is better suited for primary grades instead of preschoolers because of its abstract ideas. The book has great illustrations and presents ideas for conversation with children on the different stages of mourning. I like this book because it can speak to us all; age does not determine the intensity with which one mourns the death of a loved one."
5,A Must have,"I am so glad I purchased this for my IPod, I have small grandchildren...that should explain the need for the cover.It has protected my IPod, also a great value."
1,Not Good Enough,"As a life long fan of Hardcore Underground Hip Hop, I am Becoming more and more disillusioned with the apparent lack of effort being put into the latest albums from the wu-tang and others like mobb deep and Nas. As much as I Wanted to like this album i found myself straining to understand where their music is now comming from. Where on earth has that unique wu-tang style of production gone, because it clearly is not evedent on this album. The Thing that seems to be missing most is the HUNGER they used to have to want to do their best and be the best in the game. May-be I should take my misplaced loyaly to the Wu, Mobb Deep, Nas, and other well established RAP artists and invest it in other up-and-comming artists who show no such contempt for their fans and perhaps show a bit more hunger in the the quality of their music"
3,the wu is back?,"what happened to the wu. this cd is pretty close to wack. by far the weakest wu tang album, although its way better than most records by other rap groups. something about the beats on almost all the song annoy me. i dont know why rza had to mess with his own fool proof production methods. where rza's beats would have been empty he's thrown in horns and lots of soul samples. this might sound like a good thing but really...its not. all the members who actually have verses (very little from u god and masta) are really good. as far as I'm concerned flava flav could have been left off the album. that song and chrome wheels are really the only ones i dont like. but I'm kind of confused...where is the wu tang clan i used to listen to?"
3,nice music,I like Flava Flav's appearance a lot. Maybe not their best album but good still. I usually like to listen to the whole discography if I like the artist. This album will not disappoint.
4,The Clan Is Wooo!!!,"Wu Tang have become a part of our life and once again they hit the news with ""Iron Flag"" a tight album with beats which only the Wu Tang Clan own their secret making and without knowing how and why we just love them.It's a mystikal thing goin' on between wu tang and their fan.And the clan make more and more adicts everyday.So If you seek for an experience beyond the understanding dare listen to Iron Flag Come On !!! Get It"
3,"Inconsistent, but with great moments.","This isn't the strongest overall album by the Wu, but it's got some real standout tracks. RZA's beats are superb on ""Rules"" and Uzi"" while the rhymes are outstanding, especially by Method Man. The group misses Old Dirty Bastard, whose absence was caused by a jail term, but are able to cope without him. Much of the album's tracks seem like filler that will have you reaching for the track skip button. If you're looking for your first Wu album grab 36 chambers instead and come back to this later."
2,"...after the laughter, comes tears....","...first the fatboys breakup...and now this...to be honest, this might actually be an outstanding piece of american music...i just cant make it past the fourth track, i've tried and tried, but this sh!t drags....after this, it is official: i am turnin in my wu-card."
3,Not what I expected,"This CD is not what I expected. First when I listened to it I thought it was great. But after a few weeks I changed my mind. ""Enter The Wu-Tang"" is a masterpiece and so is ""Wu-Tang Forever"".When they released ""The W"" in the late 2000 I thought it just was an isolated case. But it wasn't."
1,iron flag,iron flag was abig let down because it was more mainstream than raw the album is wackk with only mediocre tracks avoid this album this is not the type of wu im accostumed too iron flag did not live up to the hype but the real question is has wu gone mainstream?
2,WHATS HAPPENED???????,"the production on this cd is terrible and so are most of the lyrics, even the dismal W was better then this sh*t"
5,They not stoppin!,PeaceYo they deliever again the God going to keep this short yo get the Album my Brothers are Black and Proud can't beat that Nah Mean!Black Woman Mother of CivilizationPeace
3,Wu there?,"Not bad. Better than previous albums. Definately better than ""36 Chambers"". Not a bad buy."
2,garbage,"I'll be the first to admitt I love wu tang but this album to me was simply garbage. The lyrics were ok nothing like their first couple of cds. Wu tang is not the same ever since odb got locked up. It seems that they cared more about their solo albums then they did about there group album and thats sad because I would love to see wu tang blow up again. Their beats [were bad] on this album and I'm saying that because I know what their capable of, coming up with the dopest beats around. People are trying to say it's a good album and there giving it 5 stars because they are wu tang fans but if that album were to be relesed on a different name every body would be dissing it. So if you feel like throwing money away buy this album and you'll see what I'm talking about."
1,Worst album yet!,"Ghostface supposrts Bush on this...what an Uncle Tom NEGRO!Besides that the album has some good beats, but the lyrics are pure garbage! No substance what so ever, buy Nas instead!"
3,Disappointing,"Definitely the most disappointing of all of the WU albums. Even if you are a WU fan, this is an album you can pass on..."
3,What went wrong?,"Wu-tang is my favorite rap group of all time but this album isnt all that great. Most of the beats suck and its too mainstream. Wasnt much raw material. ODB couldnt record with them also INS was in the background most of the time, leaving U-God and Masta Killa to do more than him. What the hell. Nothing can match up to 36 Chambers and anyone who says this is better than 36 Chambers, Wu-Tang Forever and The W must be silly in the mind.Worse Tracks: Dashing, Soul Power (worse wu beat of all time - what was Rza thinking)Best tracks: Iron Flag (until it gets to the next song in the track), Yall Been Warned, Rules, and Uzi was ok - had to grow into that song."
4,"Not great like 36 Chambers, but better current radio stuff",It's ok that this CD isn't as ground breaking as 36 Chambers. Most groups early albums are better than their later ones anyway. But Iron Flag is still a solid effort and very good CD compared to all the crap on the radio now.
4,"good album, better than ""the W"", but not much better","True Wu Tang fans will be a little disapointed in this album due to the fact that there are many hooks on the songs, and that the beats and lyrics are more watered down than albums like ""Wu Tang Forever"" and all the first Wu solo releases. However the album is better than the pathetic ""The W"" cd which was an embarresment to the Clan's reputation. It would be nice to see the Wu Tang Clan return to more experimental beats and rhymes(Ie. Wu Tang Forever, Supreme Clientele), as the beats are not that cutting edge on this album. Over all the album is good, but their are no real suprises, as they are still going after the mainstream audience, but not as bad as ""The W"""
5,Great album,"This album is very similar to, but much better than the W. That is, it is not like Enter the Wu-Tang, because the feel is more artsy like the rest of their new ish. If the Wu went back to making more posse cuts and the songs like on IRON FLAG, I would write a letter to Amazon demanding I be able to give them six stars. This is a great CD, there are heart-felt story raps like ""Babies"" and of course the Wu-Banga's like ""Uzi"". The clan keeps more to themself this time around, that means no Redman, Nas or Snoop. This is a mixed blessing. If you like U-god, Masta Killah and Cappadonna, then u get to hear a lot more of them on this album. (U-God most underrated MC of all time!!!)However if you only like big name MCs then u will not like this as much, but you will still like it.All in all, this is a great album, and everyone should get it if they have a pulse- and if that pulse beats to the tune of RZA production."
3,Free ODB!!!,"It isn't 36 Chambers, but it's ample Wu-banga material for now. Still waiting for their next great album. Would've been an extra star if ODB was in the house. Might grow on me like the last Bobby Digital album, which is pretty good. Rza rocks."
4,Really 3 1/2 Stars,"Staten Island's intractable collective returns with ""Iron Flag,"" their latest argument in their hopes to wrest the crown of hip-hop away from others that have usurped the once mighty Wu-Tang throne. Sporting RZA's best production since ""Enter The 36...,"" ""Iron Flag"" definitely will placate already won-over fans, but the prospect of garnering new converts seems unlikely - beats are standard Diggs's fare - dusty high-pitched soul loops over simple drum patterns (which as usual falter occasionally). Personally, Method Man still possesses the most distinctive flow and delivery although the rest of the Clan are in fine boasting form, showcasing lyrics that revolve around the Clan's self-perceived state of seige. A straightforward, solid effort that should sate fans, but may not enable Staten Island's shaolin soldiers from falling prey to the affliction of most rap acts - the dreaded 'no longer in vogue' syndrome."
5,Wu 4 ever!!!,"Dis album is off da hook! Returnin' to dey original Wu-warrin', Shaolin, funky-azz kung-fu shiz. The Wu iz back! Da clan comes back in a cohesive fusion, like a musical metaphor of da original 36 Chambers yo. Dis IZ a return to da Chambers, dis IZ what Wu should be. And, don't let no Atlanta native tell you dis ain't raw, know wut I'm sayin', sayin'?Meth, Gza, Deck, Killah get da real air time, droppin' what iz da best battlin' flow. Rza's on point, samplin' da Fu flix and mixin' obscure, hypnotic cuts into a maniacal blend of sonic assault. ... May da Staten island crew reign champion again."
4,Not The Best Wu Tang Album : But Not The Worst Either,This album by Wu-Tang has it's facts of being a great rap group. This album is no where near classic but is still a good album. This album is about 10X better than THE W. THE W was just a joke to many Wu fans and I felt very dissapointed in Wu but now that they came back strong with album declaring that they are back is great.
4,No 36 chambers but wu bangin none the less,This is no 36 chambers but It has some reall tight tracks like One of thease Days and Dashing. A few of the tracks are weak but the rest make up for them. Deffinitly worth owning for any Wu Tang fan.
4,Good stuff,"I thought the Wu dropped off a little bit with some poor solo albums and a decent outing with ""The W"". However, Iron Flag is an improvement and a step in the right direction to get the Wu back on top. In the Hood, Rules, Chrome Wheels, Uzi, One of these Days, and Y'all Been Warned are my favorite tracks. The RZA is back doing most of the production, with some help from Mathematics, Tru Master, Tone & Poke, and Fury Loftin. The Wu always have great MCing, the question is whether you'll like the production or not."
4,"Initially DAMN, but it wears off...","Best beats I've heard from the Wu...but lyrically it's not. In The Hood is a great intro, especially Street Life's part, though there's no doubting the illness of Inspectah Deck, SL's ""In The Hood!"" concept is really memorable:""The ones you love will fill you with slugs in the hoodBabies born addicted to drugs in the hoodWe amke life or death decisions and the school system is like a minimal prisonSo you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm living in the hood"". Method Man's the best on Rules. The album ends well with Iron Flag(especially INS again) and Dashing. Only tracks that leave me cold are Soul Power and ""Good Thing We Brought The Glock"". Chrome Wheels isn't all that either. But overall the album's well within thumbs-up territory."
1,WEAK WEAK WEAK,"I hate to see WUTANG's name on this album. The beats are so far away from what Wu Tang is famous for, and the songs need good beats first to be good songs. I don't care if there is the best verse in hip hop history (which of course is not on this). YOU NEED GOOD BEATS!!! I can't believe the RZA. What is he doing in his life that is so much more important than recreating that Wu Tang sound!! If this is the WuTang of now, I abandon all future efforts by them. Unless some magic time capsule brings them back to 1993, then they will continue to make this stupid sh**"
2,The Wu is dead!,"Oh God! Another Wu-tang album? Didn't they release an album earlier this year? To everyone out there, the Wu dynasty is over. There will never be another album like their 36th Chambers debut. If you crave originality that the Wu has lost, then check out Ghostface Killah's Bulletproof Wallets. He is the only real emcee worth checking out. This album is only an improvement over the last one but is still below previous efforts' standards."
1,STOP! Do not buy this CD!,"Has anyone out there ever heard of the old group ""The Naughty Girls""? Well Chris Moutas used to be in the band! Now she's gone solo-but she should have just called it quits when her first shot at ""stardom"" well, went up in a puff of smoke. She's really not that talented. So sorry, but the CD's not worth purchasing."
1,"We don't particularly WANT to ""..Keep Up With .""you","Not another one.......Great. Just when you think you've found a good R&B disc-BAM! You find out you're wrong. Unfortunatly, for me, that was AFTER I bought the CD. But I didn't want that to happen to you. Granted, her first single is Ok. Seriously-Its not bad at all. Well, not really. It won't be a chart topper, though.Can't Keep Up With me Is a catchy R&B/pop song, but her entire CD sounds like that one song. Just buy the single-the rest of it is a waste."
1,Waste of money!!!,What a disappointment! I'm so glad I only paid $4 for this joke of a toy and it isn't even worth that much. It is only about 3 inches high and 7 inches long all put together. I would have returned it if I had to pay full price for this dollar store size gift. Buy something Thomas & Friends that is part of the wooden train sets and not one with these cheap magnetic connectors.
2,Not the most user friendly,"This isn't as easy to use as you would think. In fact, it was so cumbersome to use with my iPhone that I just gave up and it's ended up in a drawer. Using this also doesn't allow you to interchange easily between this and other cases. I'm not a big fan of this product."
4,Very Informative,"Gleason's book is great because it offers works from other authors, so that you can gain the perspective of other experts in the field. This book really helped me understand the development of language. The book was particularly useful for me, because I am studying to be a School Psychologist."
5,The Development of Language ( 7th edition),The book is a very good condition and it is very cheap. I didn't expect it but when I saw the book and I surprised that why it is very cheap. And also shipping is very fast. I recommond it. No complain. I will order some books for next semesters.
1,Poorly Written,"Anyone who actually has to read this book - for a class, for personal interest - will find that is poorly written. It is imprecise and repetitive as a whole and even within each chapter. The book could easily be written in 1/4 of the current 512 pages.Its format seems to be its downfall -different authors for each chapter. Yet even this cannot explain its baffling chapter-internal arrangements.If you care for your students, you will seek out a more readable book or begin a replacement for it. If you are considering reading this book out of interest -do not. It will discourage you, ... just as it does the majority of students who must suffer from its reading."
4,Great little reference book,"This is a great little book. It would be a lot better, though, if the pages weren't so thin. I am a radiography student and carry it around a lot and use it for reference. If I could change two things about this book, it would be that I would make the pages a little tougher or laminated so that they wouldn't rip out of the ring or get hung on the edge of the ring and I would also put tabs for quick reference."
5,The Greatest,"I have these songs of the O Jays on an LP album, so of course I no longer have a record player to play it on, these songs bring back so many memories and good times."
4,"Second ""Unreleased"" not quite as good as first","""Greater,"" the second in a series of ""unreleased"" Cathedrals albums, doesn't quite stack up to the first in the series (""Cherish That Name""). On this album, the production isn't quite as crisp, and the songs are a bit too similar to all be on the same album. There are a couple stand-outs, however. ""Feelin' At Home (In The Presence of Jesus)"" is a great, laid-back (and only) feature for Glen Payne on the album, and Kirk Talley's rendition of Dallas Holm's ""Rise Again"" is nothing less than spine-chilling. Other than that, I'd rank this as ""one for the collection,"" meaning that if you're a fan of the Cathedrals, you should go ahead and buy it (as I have).**incidencally, ""Unreleased"" refers to retail distribution. These albums WERE previously available on LP and cassette at concerts; they were never released in stores."
3,not the best,"I am a fan of milwaukee tools but I have to admit that this model is not their best effort. If you need a truly heavy duty saw then this is not it. Although I haven't had any problems so far with this saw I know plenty of people who have and since I bought this based on price I really regret not paying the $50 more for a better model.update Nov 2010- the saw has warped and no longer cuts straight, its always off by a few degrees, spend more money on a better saw if you ask me as this one was lightly used and still failed to last."
2,SUCKS,"THE SWITCH IS A PROMISE OF GOING OUT, WHEN IT DOES IT IS IN THE ON POSITION. HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE. WOULD NOT BUY THIS SAW AGAIN, BAD TOOL."
2,Not the same old Milwaukee,"I bought this saw hoping to have the same reliability as the older models had. After 3 months of light use (first blade still), the switch hung up is the on position. It had been stiching on more than once but finally died. I went to the repair shop for warranty work on the tech said it would not be the last switch i'll put in this saw. He also said the saw is made by Ryobi. Buy the Makita instead."
3,"Okay for 90 cuts, not 45","The stamped steel back half of the vise is not true vertical, so it's okay for 90 cuts. I needed 45 cuts on square stock and the cuts were oblique. I returned it and got the 6180-20 for $40 more. The base is cast aluminum and solid, but the vise is cast iron and therefore machined and square. The motor has more power, too, and the handle is a better orientation. It's worth the extra. Yes, of course it's made in China. Isn't everything?"
2,Lost a loyal customer,"I have had this saw for about 5 months when I noticed a small crack on the left side of the arm (I have used 3 blades). I contacted Milwaukee, of course you need to send it in for evaluation to see if it would fall under the warranty.I sent them some very clear pictures of the crack, explained it had not been moved since I took it out of the box and put it in the bench. Now I am left with the option of mailing it in, only to have them say ""not covered"" and then what, pay to get it shipped back? After going to one of the big hardware stores I looked at 4 different saws on the shelf and WOW, I was shocked at how thin the casting was on the Milwaukee saw, I can see why it cracked compared to the much better engineered arms. Just like every other company the ""made in china"" stands for how can we make this item as cheap as possible and get away with it."
3,Thank You Jerry,"Goodman is the stylistic savior and musical class of this entourage. Steve Smith certainly has the chops, but shows little restraint here. At times this record sounds like one big drum solo overriding the other participants."
4,A truly smoking jazz album.......,"Fine compositions and none of the usual wanking associated with all-star sessions. They obviously enjoyed themselves, fans of Mahavishnu should be especially impresssed."
1,Conflicting information,"I am way confused. The title and product description describe it as a GMAT/GRE/LSAT program, but the cover photo and features description describe it as a SAT/ACT/PSAT program. Which is it? Also, the title seems to indicate it works on a Mac, but the product description only mentions Windows.Can someone please clarify?"
1,WARNING - What you order isn't what you get.,"I ordered the ""Kaplan GMAT/GRE/LSAT (PC & Mac) [CD-ROM]. ""What arrived was this PSAT and SAT program. My order still reflect the ""Kaplan GMAT/GRE/LSAT (PC & Mac) [CD-ROM] "" name, and it still clicks through to this page. But, now the product name reflect SAT/PSAT, instead of GMAT/GRE/LSAT.This is realy aggrevating. When I read the previous posting I thought someone had just been sloppy on the listing, cutting and pasting more than they should. Now I see, the ""Kaplan GMAT/GRE/LSAT (PC & Mac) [CD-ROM]"" must not be available and they sent the PSAT/SAT Windows only product instead.This is the first time that Amazon has ever let me down in this way, which considering I've been their customer for over 8 years isn't a bad track record, but still I hope it's the last."
2,Not Impressed,The fax machine is quick at printing out receiving faxes. However it is rather slow in faxing out documents. I feel I should have bought the Canon faxphone L80 which is 33.6khz versus the Panasonic at 14.4Khz.Also the pages often get jammed in the machine which is not something you want to see in a $200 fax machine.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THIS MACHINE IS AWEFUL. I SPENT $200.00 ON THIS MACHINE ONLY TO HAVE A PAPER JAM FAX, AFTER FAX, AFTER FAX. THIS USUALLY OCCURS WHEN I AM FAXING ONLY ONE SHEET OF PAPER TOO, QUITE ANNOYING AND FUSTRATING. I DO A LOT OF FAXING AND NEEDED A QUICK AND DEPENDABLE MACHINE. THIS WAS NOT THE MACHINE TO BUY. IT TENDS TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TONER TOO WHICH CAN BE QUITE COSTLY. THE PAPERS I FAX HAVE SMALL PRINT ON THEM AND WHEN I FAX THEM OUT THEY ARE BLURRED ON THE OTHER END AND LOOK SMEARED. THE SPEED IS GOOD ON THE MACHINE AND IT COPIES GREAT. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MACHINE AND WISHED I HAD BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND. PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IF YOU PLAN ON BUYING THIS FAX MACHINE. I ONLY WISH I KNEW IN ADVANCE. (BOTTOM LINE IF YOU FAX A LOT OR HAVVE SMALL PRINT IN THE ITEMS YOU FAX DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE)."
1,Time waster- very frustrating,I hate faxing with this fax machine- it is such a time waster. It NEVER sends on the first 'connect'. I have to dial wait for it to ring then it connects but makes the connect ring for aa while and then it hangs up. then i have to redial and then it connects and sends. I have NEVER had it connect and send on the first. It takes 10 min when it should take 5. I do not recommend it at all.
2,Worked for about a year,"Worked fine for about a year. Now both paper feeders jam! I can't send a fax, make a copy or receive a fax. The paper feeders don't grab the paper. I tried cleaning the unit to no avail. Next I called the Panasonic support number. (As a side note the service number included with the fax machine is for porn). Finding the correct number on the website was a waste of time. They were of no help. Nearest authorized service center was 1.5 hours away. After the problems I have had with this Panasonic a several Panasonic cordless phones I won't buy any of their products again."
1,Horrible machine!,This is the absolute worst fax machine ever! I would not even call it a fax machine because it doesn't fax! Where to start -- the paper feeder will not take multiple pages. It jams or smashes 3 pages together. Do not buy this product. It's a waste of you money. It's a waste of your time. You'll just end up having to buy a new fax machine anyway.
1,I want to bash it with a bat.,"I dont' know where to start. I cannot put multiple pages in at a time. It won't even grab one page at a time without hand feeding it like shoving a dollar bill in a change machine. I could go on, but that is reason enough to not purchase one."
3,Customer service leaves something to be desired...,"Very little communication by customer service, except to tell me that my address was wrong. Which it wasn't. I then waited a week for them to respond again to tell me the item was coming and did not receive a response. I had to email them to ask what was going on. At which point I was informed that my item had been shipped. Very unprofessional. The packaging was also in very bad condition.The product was exactly what I ordered and is new as far as I can tell."
3,planned obsolesence,"I loved this machine when I first bought it. Toner is reasonably priced..drums ok but unfortunately you can no longer buy replacement drums at any of the office stores, they can only be purchased on internet sites, with an addition $8 shipping added. Also I have had the re-occuring problem of ""white"" columns running down the received fax pages and have have cleaned the machine according to the instruction manuel. This did not correct the problem and a call to the help line did not either. Bottom line was that the drum I had installed 5 months ago was defective and I had to purchase another one for another $100 plus shipping. While I have not had a problem with paper jams, if this new drum does not correct the ""white"" column missing print problem I will purchase a new machine and it will not be a panosonic."
3,fax machine,"The fax works fine for a small office. This is the second one I had. The first one broke after 2 years, but was used a lot!! for the price it is worth it. Not the best fax, but does the job."
1,Nothing but jam after jam,Let me join in the chorus of those warning against this purchase. This fax machine worked well for about 6 mos. but since then it is almost impossible to get anything faxed or copied without jamming during the first couple attempts. Even more annoying is that it then has to print out an error message thereby wasting a full page for a couple lines of useless text. The same problem is starting creep up on incoming faxes as well. The perceived value of this machine quickly disappears when you spend 5 minutes trying to get a single page sent. Now it is almost completely useless.
2,Pointless,"We bought this machine just under 1 year ago. Within a few months the toner was stuck in the drum and bent other pieces in the drum. Since then it has been easier to remove and replace toner, but the toner spills out everywhere. Now we need to replace the drum and there is absolutely no point in spending just as much as it cost to buy this machine. I myself did not choose this machine, and would not have if I had read all of these reviews. We've never experienced paper jams like everyone else, but customer service is terrible and the manual barely explains anything, I have to wear gloves anytime I have to open it up and usually get too angry with it and make someone else do it."
4,Pretty Good Fax Machine,"I've been using this fax machine for my small business for the last 3 years, and it works very well. Occasionally - I mean about 3 or 4 times in 3 years - we'll need to clean the rollers with isopropyl alchohol if we have any problems with document feeding when sending a fax. Other than that this machine has been problem-free in a relatively high volume environment.Like a previous reviewer wrote, the toner messages and beeping and all that can be annoying, but I'd bet that everyone would complain if the machine didn't warn about low toner. Anyway, once the toner warning commences you can get by for at least a few days if not weeks by taking the toner cartridge out and shaking it. No spells or incantations necessary - just shake the thing. Order a new cartridge, though, when you get to the shaking point.I'd buy it again."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I've own this fax machine for a little more than a year. I primarily use it to make copies for my business taxes at the end of each month. Yesterday I got the ""Low Toner"" warning in the display. I've probably at the most have made 250 copies with this machine and I'm already out of toner($29.00). Panasonic says that I should get approximately 2500 faxes/copies, etc. before the toner runs out. Try 10% of that! Also, the most annoying part of this fax machine are the junk faxes, which you probably have guessed it, use more toner! It has a setting for junk faxes, but it has only caught 1 or 2 of the hundred or so that I have received. Plus there's now way of deleting faxes from its memory. If it has junk faxes stored in its memory there's no way of cancelling them, it's going to print them out no matter if you want them or not."
1,Be Afraid...Be Very Afraid!!!!,"Bar none the worst business machine I've ever owned.Like others have said, single faxes have to be forced into the slot to hopefully get them to feed. Multiple sheets go through three or four at a time. A complete waste of your money. I'm dumping it for a Brother 4100e."
3,Did i have a bad copy?,"i must have had a bad copy. im very good at rpg's but i beat this game without ever dying or even trying..im good but not that good.has anyoneheard of any defects with these games or is this the they all are.i agree with most reviews,the story was good,but what with all the uselessitems? reading the reviews has made me deside to give this game a secondchance."
4,Awesome game.... could have been better,"Shadow Madness is a truly amazing game. Being one of the RPGs I ever played, I really couldnt tell you that there were many flaws. The only major flaw in the game is the graphics. They are the worst I've ever seen. But a side from that, this game is absolutely amazing. It holds one of the greatest and one of the creepiest storylines I've ever seen. People say that it's just a basic capy of FF7, but it's nothing like it. One of the coolest elements of the game is the music. All of the music is just right for the situation, making the gameplay even cooler. Above all, despite the graphics, Shadow Madness is a truly magnificent game. You should really try it out."
1,Awful!,I would never recommend this game to anyone. It's boring and slow. The art looked sloppy and the story line was lame. I've played an extensive amount of the rpg's on the market and this had to be one of the worst.
2,Isn't what I expected,"Shadow Madness sounded good,but it isn't.The graphics are O.K. If I were you I wouldn't buy it. I rented it and I was only about 15 minutes into it till I relized it wasn't very good.If it got a grade it would be a C.It is 2 disks long.If it was a rating 1 being the best and 100 being the worst it would be 70th.So far of what I have played Final Fansty 8 was the best."
3,Great Concept - Fair Execution,I found this software difficult to use. It is not as easy as just picking a few meals and printing out a grocery list. I am still searching...
3,Running Out Steam...,"The not-so-grand finale in the Charlie Resnick series certainly exhibits the signs of Harvey's weariness with the series. The highly predictable main plot features an escaped murderer with a sordid childhood, and is the least interesting element of the book. The police efforts to stem a series of drug-related killings brings in a number of minor players from past books and is somewhat more interesting. But of course it is the developments in Resnick's private and professional life that drives the book and rescues it in the end."
4,Intuitive Detective,"Charlie Resnick, the intuitive, low-key Detective Inspector, is embroiled in two separate cases which become intertwined. To begin with there is the shooting of a key drug distributor by a rival, and the chase to find the missing weapon and proof of the perpetrator's guilt. Then there is a murderer who receives permission to attend his mother's funeral and escapes from his keepers.Both these situations occupy Resnick amid fears of an escalating drug war between various factions: find and recapture the escapee, and keep a lid on the volatile situation in the streets. Resnick smoothly pursues both goals while enjoying his love of music and trying to make sense of his own love life.Tenth in the series, the novel is simply told and written with polish. The story moves fluidly and the suspense builds to an explosive climax. The characters are portrayed in a realistic manner, and while the two elements of the story are unrelated, the author meshes them believably. Recommended."
2,A mediocre treatment,"The bottom line with respect to this book is that there is simply little that is particularly new or remarkable here. On the contrary, this author's treatment of the subject matter is far more muddled and meandering that other contemporary treatments of ""ancient"" wisdom applied to contemporary leadership/workplace issues.There is a great deal that needs improvement in this book. The subject matter has been hashed over a lot recently, but good treatments would still be of interest. There's a lot of loose talk about ""scientific evidence this ... "" and ""science is now showing that ... "" etc. with no attempts to provide references or corroborating information. The author's writing style is such that he tends to careen from one thing to another in a way that I found simply annoying.In short, in my opinion this is not one of the better books in this area by any means."
4,Hi-Fidelity Lounge-Volume Three,"This one has some nice tracks on it. I don't like it as much as Volume One though. M. Dupont and Soul Vibration are my favorites. The track Smooth sounds like an Isaac Hayes track called Joy. I liked the Isaac Hayes track but this is just instrumental. Still, this is a nice CD to relax to."
3,Early work,I believe this is her first (or one of her first) published work and it shows. It isn't among my favorites but it was ok.
2,Will I be crucified?,"Will I be strung up for not liking an Austen book? Ah, but be honest I must.This is a fairly short read, but I just didn't like it. I thought it was dry and didn't really go anywhere.I wanted to like it, but i found it a little lackluster."
3,A bit different,"Good writing but not the same as others of Jane Austen. It is written as letters between a variety of people. The heroine, if you can call her that, is not very nice and so the reader wishes for her comeuppance, but it doesn't happen. Recommended for people who want a bit different side to Jane Austen."
3,Lady Susan,"Lady Susan is a book of letters, not a read. Its okay,not quite my style of reading. I would tell my anyone it was not quite my style."
3,I wish it was longer...,"This novel, which is really just a collection of letters between the handful of main characters, was apparently Jane Austen's true first work. As such, it is short and to the point, which means that it leaves a lot to be desired. I think the idea for the story was a good one, and the fact that it was written in letters didn't bother me. Although Ms. Austen used her usual wit and sarcasm in creating her characters, unlike her other works even the most despised character gets something of what she wants in the end, which was a bit disappointing. I rate it three out of five stars because if you've already read and enjoyed all of Jane Austen's other novels, you might as well read this one, but definitely don't pick it up before, say, Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice."
2,Lady Susan,"I simply could not get past the ""letters"" written to each person, which I personally felt were boring. I would only recommend this book to a person who truly had the time to keep the charactors straight and read the book for more that an hour at a time."
2,Wouldn't recommend,Not her best ... I'm a big Jane Austen fan but this book definitely fell short of what she accomplished.
2,I agree with KraftyKid on this review,"Not the best of Jane Austen!I started to read this book, but could never finish it. It's just so different from what we know of Jane Austen's writings while the manner of writing in this ""letter style"" made it a more difficult reading. Also I did not like the characters.I give it two stars only because its a Jane Austen book, and I have to consider the fact that she was very young when she wrote Lady Susan."
2,Lady Susan is no lady,"I am sorry to you Austen fan's, but this is a very boring book. I keep waiting for something to happen. So far it is a story about a self-will titled older woman who does what ever it takes to get her own way. I am not done with the book as yet, not sure I will finish it.By the way, this is the first Austen book I have come across that I did not enjoy."
3,Lady Susan,Letters written back and forth was an interesting format. Thoroughly descriptive and entertaining. This book was written many decades ago but human nature is the same.
4,Can't wait to read more,"Earlier today, I was sifting through reviews of books I had an interest in obtaining. I came across a well-written, unorthodox review of a romance novel. In the review, the writer sang the praises of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in that she found it far superior to the book in question. Given that I enjoyed her review, I thought I would give her suggestion a try. In combing through the other Jane Austen selections, I downloaded ""Lady Susan"" because it was shorter and I wanted to get a feel for Jane Austen before investing a lot of time into one of her more lengthy writings. I was not disappointed. This is the first time I have read any story in this format and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I am definitely looking forward to delving into her other writings."
3,But it is Jane Austen,"Lady Susan has the usual Jane Austen touch -- although it is not up to the standards of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Emma."""
3,Interesting,This collection provided an interesting glimpse into the author's mind and process. Familiar character names and story lines are touched on.
3,A Must for Austen Fans!,"Jane Austen was a woman ahead of her time. In this very short novella, she writes letters to and from Lady Susan regarding her daughter's intended relationship. At a time in life, women had very few options. A prominent, well-bred adult woman has few choices such as the men in her life. This was still a patriarchal world. Anyway, I'm not an Austen fan but I was glad that the book was short and had a great introduction. This book is not for everybody. It can be dull and tedious at time but I think Austen does capture the letter writing and correspondence of the time period where letters were the main source of correspondence between people like Lady Susan, a prominent, well-bred wife and mother regarding her daughter's future. She hopes that her daughter finds a suitable husband of equal status."
3,Not your typical Austen,"This short story is certainly not your typical Austen depicting a heroine's romance and then a happy ending. This story is in the form of letters, which was handled well, but I think limits Austen's story telling ability. In Lady Susan the heroine is in fact a manipulative villain with no redeeming qualities and I found myself frustrated with the other characters reactions to her schemes. I also thought the letter format limited character development and had this been in the form of her more traditional novels it might have been a very interesting story with a meddling mother and her daughter becoming our heroine. Worth a read but if you're a fan of Austen's novels this is quite a change of pace."
4,an unlikely favorite,"when we got this video i was disappointed. i thought it would go in the pile of videos we never use. it is now my 2 year old's favorite video. the quality of the animation is poor, but entertainment and educational value is very high. somehow, it keeps his attention and he resites every word. he asks for it more than teletubbies. i think that the content is great, it explains 1-10 and also explains the value of zero. it is 4 or so very short episodes on one tape. it's really worth the 9.99, and the kids love it, i don't know why! get it and see."
3,"Looks good, works well overall but too much noise","I bought this because I needed an affordable bluetooth headset. It's small, holds a charge pretty well and was easy to use. I have two gripes, however:1) It picks up too much background noise, so much so that often people would ask me to switch back to my phone.2) The speaker doesn't get loud enough. It's fine for normal ambient noise, but hard to hear in any noisier situations.I eventually stopped using it for those two reasons, because they prevented me from ever getting in the habit of it."
2,"Only one worked, bad power supply on the other","Received both headsets but one had a failed power supply. Instead of going through sending it back, I'll buy a power supply. Less problems."
4,Mighty High Advantage,"Now a days, rappers and producers have their own independent label to get a name for themselves. Hence, Mr. Eon and DJ Mighty Mi formed the label for bringing hip-hop back, named Rawkus. Production was handled by half team member, DJ Mighty Mi, with a little help from Reef and the Alchemist. They have sparked careers for Mos Def and labelmate Pharoahe Monch which Home Field Advantage features them both. There are other underground names on here you may recognize, but the real push comes from the effort put forth by Mr. Eon to keep hip-hop in its essence form. Just check him on a solo creep on ""Hot Spittable"" which would get an A+ for a class of music that is slowly dying. Only hip-hop heads would appreciate this."
1,An oversight - no e-book,"Why is this book not available as an e-book? I want to have this information available on my iPad, or iTouch. Who want's to lug a 655 page tome around?"
2,Could have been good,"Unfortunately, the bike arrived with a missing seat and the hardware necessary to attach the wheel guards. Some major tinkering has to be done, for example to keep the chain guard from hitting the pedal. The manufacturer promised a new seat three weeks ago, and I have yet to get it. There was a chance I could have been happy about this purchase, but given the lack of pieces and the hassle with trying to obtain them I can't say that I am."
2,Good bike to have to work on,Very hard to put together if you don't have metric tools. The wheels were altered in the shipping and was missing essential parts. Wasn't able to ride it and had to walk it into a bike shop for a $50 bare essential repair job. The bike took forever to ship and was in poor condition upon arrival. Better luck with a different company.
5,Pavilion Issue,"The problem is not HP's fault. I have a Pavilion XG833 and the real problem, as a few of you have stated, is the onboard graphics. The onboard graphics are by Intel. I have an intel i80 chipset, which on intel's website it says you cannot update the graphics AT ALL... NO CARDS EITHER. However, if you have an i80e chipset you may disable the graphics driver and install the Radeon 7000. So basically, if you have an i80 chipset you're screwed."
5,Ah HA HA HA,"For All Those Peeps Who Say DONT BUY THIS FOR PAVILION COMPUTERS I SAY, ""I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION"", It Works Wonderfully in my pavilion."
2,Fell Apart,I bought a few charms from another vendor than Pugster and they literally fell apart. I was putting the charm onto my bracelet when the butterfuly fell off! It looked like they had glued it with a tiny amount of glue. The vendor did refund my money. But it was disappointing since I the blue butterfuly was pretty. The other charm was for my dog. Same thing happened the top part fell off...
1,Save your money,"I purchased this along with the small size Toppik fibers.After the first use it became clogged with the fibers and would no longer work.I attempted to clean it, but that did no good."
4,Good accessory,"The Toppik Spray Applicator is a good accessory to have. I would have rated the item higher, however, the applicator is only sized for the small Toppik bottle."
5,A must read for anyone interested in Epistemology.,"Kelley's monograph is an original defense of realism in perception. He argues that perception is the discrimination of objects as entities, that this awareness is direct, and that this perception is a reliable foundation for empirical knowledge. Key to his argument is the distinction between object of perception and form of perception, a distinction not made by many others in the field. Kelley's work considers alternative views fairly, while arguing persuasively for his position. It also suggests a view of concept formation, an area that is all too often not dealt with properly by philosophers, if at all.This book is a must read for anyone interested in the philosophy of perception or epistemology more broadly! Bravo!"
1,A THINLY DISGUISED PITCH FOR AYN RAND,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow student in my philosophy class, who I later learned was the leader of the campus Objectivist group. It is essentially an argument for a naive form of realism that -- surprise, surprise -- turns out to be identical with Ayn Rand's views!To paraphrase the Scottish philosopher David Hume, who has far more claim to the title of philosopher than either Kelley or Rand, ""commit it to flames, for it contains nothing but sophistry and illusion.""A more informative read would be Jeff Walker's book, The Ayn Rand Cult. As for philosophy, stick with the greats: Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Russell, etc. If you want an introduction to epistemology specifically, Roderick Chisholm's book, Theory of Knowledge, is excellent and unfettered by any hidden agenda."
4,Great Value Grinder/Sander For A Small Price,"I chose this model because I simply planned to use it to remove rust, bondo and welds from mild steel, not needing the large unwieldy models for masonry work. I also liked the safety paddle switch that prevents accidental turn on.This product has exceeded my expectations, and performed well in every task I've used it for. It is very powerful (watch out, this tool can injure your wrist) runs cool even with heavy use and functions well as a cutoff tool. With a sanding back, it will handle any orbital sanding duties required.The wrench supplied for wheel removal is a joy to use and far stronger than needed for the task of changing discs.The only reason I gave it four stars is the lack of spiral bevel gears like the 6140 model; it deserves five in every other aspect."
5,Down The Well,"Down the Well is the first DVD of Inuyasha, containing the first three episodes. Kagome Higurashi, a normal girl of 15 falls into a magical well on her family's shrine and finds herself 400-500 years in the past. There, she meets a half-demon, half-human boy named Inuyasha, and from there the story begins. Though the first episodes I watched of Inuyasha were later on in the series, these three further pulled me in when I watched them for the first time. The series is very action-packed, and has at least one little snippet of humor in each episode. The music is fairly good, the artistic quality is excellent, and you instantly fall in love with the characters. I recommend this series for everyone but young children (some of the themes are frightening). I hope my review has helped ^^"
3,A great story...,"Not being a hardcore fan of Anime, I will say that this story is done very well - deep and well thought out characters, and small little sideliners that keep the comedy going.The only thing I'm worried about regarding the DVD release is that the series, in Japan, is already up to 89 episodes. With three episodes on the first DVD only... well, you do the math. That's the only reason I gave the DVD three stars.Otherwise, absolutely great show..!"
5,Inuyasha - A Feudal Fairy Tale,"Inuyasha is one of the best anime shows that I've seen in a long time. It is the story of a girl named Kagome who falls down a well and ends up in Feudal Japan where she accidentally frees a half human - half dog demon boy named Inuyasha.Fifty years ago, Inuyasha tried to steal the sacred Shikon Jewel (a.k.a. Jewel of Four Souls) to become a full-blooded demon. However, the village priestess Kikyo shoots an arrow through his chest and imprisons him to a tree where he is to sleep for all time.While there, it is discovered that the jewel is in Kagome's body and once it is free, a crow steals it. In an attempt to get it back, the jewel is shattered and Kagome and Inuyasha reluctantly team up to get the shards back.This is a cool anime worth watching!!;-) Catami5"
3,Recycled Cast,"How boring to have just thrown together the old American voice cast of Ranma 1/2 with a few newcomers, especially since Ranma and Inuyasha have nothing in common, except an amazing writer, Rumiko Takahashi. However, I love Inuyasha and am excited to see it come to North America. Having watched subtitled copies of it for the past year now, watching it dubbed and ""cleaned up"" by American censors is a bit disappointing. And Kagome's (or ""Kagomie"" as she pronounces it in the dubbed version) and Kaede's voices are so wrong for the characters (proper English accent in Feudal Japan? I dont think so). Plus Inuyasha sounds like a Californian surfer-boy from the 80's. I gave it 3 stars because the actual anime ( animation, music, original storyline) are totally amazing and should be seen by every anime fan (subtitled if you can get your hands on it!)."
5,Inu-Yasha is the bomb!,"Reveiwer:Japanese anime lover.Inu-yasha is the best anime I ever saw. It's my fav by far it has been for the past two or thee years.volume 1 is awsome,the first time I saw it I knew I was in love with the show. I have also watched 1 through 37 on cartoon network I liked them so much that I recorded them to save some cash.The voices of the show are perfect(well thats my opinion). Richard Cox &Monica; Stori (Inu-Yasha and Kagome) are the perfect voice cast. They capter them perfect esp. Richard Cox. They also did a perfect job with the translation. But I think that Inu-Yasha is the best Anime Rumiko Takahashi has done so far. So I suggest that all of the people who are reading this now & don't realy know the story I suggest you read the books,watch the DVD's or watch it on Adult Swim on cartoon network. Because I know will find it as awsome as I do.Thanks for reading htis & I hope it helped you!!!"
5,The Beginning of the BEST Adventure,"The first dvd in the set of many to come, and the beginning of many adventures. Inu-Yasha is a romantic-comedy with a bit of gothic horror mixed beautifully in. Complete with wonderfull legends of Japan's ancient past. And, accented with lovable, well-drawn characters.Made by Rumiko Takahshi. Who's works have sold over 100,000,000 copies world wide. Inu-Yasha...Half demon, half human...all great!"
2,Only for those who like dubbed anime...,"Now don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Inuyasha fan. But, I wasn't impressed. Not at all. First off: the voices, to be blunt, are horrble. Compared to the orginal Japanese voices the ones in the English dub sound completely fake and like they're reading off of a bad script. Second: the price. Viz wants $25 for 3 episodes when you can buy 24 episodes in the orgianl Japanese dialouge with subtitles for $30. Third: due to bad voice acting and scripts the character's personalities have changed. Kagome isn't as ditsy as they portray her and Inuyasha doesn't act like a cocky idoit (yes, he is cocky in the Japanese one too but he doesn't act idoitic).But, if you really like dubbed anime and have a lot of money to spend on the endless volumes with only a few episodes on them go ahead and buy the dub.It's nothing even close to the orginal, but it gets the point across I guess..."
5,WOW!!!!,"My cousin got me hooked on this series! I had never seen anime before and was a little skeptical at first. I expected the plot to be lacking, and the characters to be stereotypical and stupid. Boy, was I wrong! After I watched the first one, I begged my cousin to put the next one in! We ended up staying up until 2:00 in the morning! This series makes you laugh, cry and laugh some more! I can't wait until the next ones come out! I highly recommend this series to anyone!"
5,I love InuYasha,"InuYasha is an action adventure. I all ready have a dvd but i want the rest. The plot is sweet (sowwie kid lingo for thoses adults) the charaters are super cool and there names are easy to say. each character is unique and i love that. the art work is spectaculer and so is the unique choise of wording. I say the best (well tied with best-others-trigun, cowboy bebop and blue gender) anime ever!!!!!"
4,Finally,"A nas album is suppost sound like stillmatic even doe he still doesnt have that hip hop sound he had wit it was writtin & illmatic ? It still surpass ""i am "" , "" nastrasdumas"" , and the awfull album ""gods son"" with no question. Go copy it!"
5,Modernized version of Illmatic,"Illmatic was before my time, but I checked it out a year or so ago, and thought that it would've been great at the time, but its stale when you compare it to other artists who are putting out CD's right now. When I got Stillmatic, I thought that every single one of the tracks actually had a meaning to it. Most rap albums out right now are just about having sex and doing drugs. This CD is an automatic classic just because Nas is a master lyricist who can add meaning to his songs. When you team up DJ Premier's phat beats with Nas's master lyrics, you are going to have one of the best CD's of all time. Definently pick this one up."
5,Nas - Stillmatic,"Nas' new cd is classic. He's back and he's making a statement. With ""Got Ur Self A.."", ""Ether"", and ""One Mic"" you know Nas is back and to takeover. This is a great album. And one of the greatest Nas albums ever. Other dope songs are: ""You're Da Man"", ""Rewind"", ""2nd Childhood"", ""Destroy & Rebuild"", ""Rule"" and my favorite ""Braveheart Party"" which is no longer being put on the album I have it cause I got it the day it came out. If you are lucky you might find a album with it. But Nas really puts it down on this album and reps Queens to the fullest. You gotta cop it. CLASSIC"
2,"smarten up, nas","okay. indeed this is his best effort in years, however it's oo little, too late. he still has not crafted a stellar ALBUM sinceillmatic. in order to even consider being one of ""the great ones"", generally you are suppose to get better with each album not progressively worse. this has more of an effort and yes, Jigga has left him scrambling to salvage a once promising career. Since Nas, we've had DMX, Xzibit & Nelly all of which have grown before our eyes. nas, flounders with flashes of brilliance that dye out before they have a chance to spark up. STICK WITH PRIMO!!!"
2,"please nas ,one dope album every ten year average","Here we go again every one's saying nas is back, he is changing his style back to illmatic just like he said on i am and nastradamus. This is album is still full of very poor prodution from trackmasters and swissbeats, don't get me wrong there is two or three good tracks with prodution by premo and large pro but for most part wack. A word of advice to nas hook up with alchemist, pete rock, dj spinna and j.rawls. The one thing that has got better is nas's lyric's, he is not speaking about players and pimps so much but rapping about his own life and beefs with other people in the industry and how he has made mistakes, sorry but stillmatic is a mistake time to throw in the towel nas."
3,"Okay, but nothing great","Let's face facts..Jay Z wins. Stillmatic is just a mediocre album. There are a few highlights on the CD. For example, the first single ""Got yourself a Gun"" is hot as is the Large Professor aided ""You're the Man"", but there is so much fluff on this album. Where should I start? How about ""Ether"". Did Nas really call Jay a ""Tae Bo H o""? Did Nas really make fun of Jay Z's facial hair? Did Nas really use sophomoric antics and call Jay Z G ay Z? Hmm..Jay was right, you are lame. Another weak song is the weak uninspired, Momento rip off, ""Rewind"". ""Rewind"" just comes off as way too forced. Other weak tracks include ""Braveheart Party""--less said the better. Also, lets not forget Nas' remake of the Tears for Fears 80's pop song ""Everybody wants to Rule the World"". As you can see there is a lot of filler and disappointing material on this album. The winner, hands down, is Jigga. ..."
2,below average,"his rappers are sluggish and too much ego 2nd Childhood, doesnt' lyrically fit such a fat beat,got yourself a gun, a bad example of him trying to gain the cred he never had in the first place,the tracks are terrible one mic is sonically off point, his rhymes seem more predictable, and the Jay Z track is just enough for him to get an increase in sales, the sad thing about this is that his best album was 'It was Written' Illmatic was him just using the back of his throat and curling his lips anyone can do that as Ras said on 'Ice Age' 'Drained your battery, Ya Bearly Talking like TEddy Ruckspin' another sad excuse for mister Nasty's ego"
1,U WACK,"I USE TO BE A BIG FAN OF NAS. I WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS GOING AROUND ASKING MY 'HOOD, IF THEY HEARD THAT NEW CAT NAMED NAS. HE'S ILL. BUT, NOW .......NAS IS CORNY. HE CHANGED ALL THE REASONS WHY I USED TO LOVE HIM. NOT NO MORE. YHIS ALBUM IS WACK. THE BEST PART OF THIS ALBUM IS WHEN I HEAR A REAL MC NAMED AZ. HE IS THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS ALBUM. WELL, NAS, HAVE TO DO BETTER NOW THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO BATTLE THE WHOLE RAP INDUSTRY. YOU BETTER ASK AZ , KRSONE AND RAKM TO GET YOUR BACK. YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE. YOU WACK"
3,IT ALRIGHT,If anything this cd was Nas answer 2 Blueprint and it's whack. Every Ghetto saves the CD but besides Poison and Every Ghetto there's not much to the disc. I wouldn't buy this if i had the chance 2. Peace!
4,Great Album...,1.Illmatic2.God's Son3.Stillmatic4.It Was Written5.The Lost Tapes6.Nastradamus7.I Am8.The rEmixesThat is my personal favorite list of nas's albums as you can see stillmatic stands out at #3.Music Vibes : 8 out of 10 Lyric Vibes : 9 out of 10 Total Vibes : 8.5 out of 10
5,Stillmatic,"Nas definitely shows he is Stillmatic with this CD. He lyrically assassins Jay-Z, and other QB rappers.Every single track on this album is great except ""Braveheart Party."" This is Nas' second best album with Illmatic being the best. This is definitely a classic album, and one of my favorites. This album is filled with the most number of quality songs since Biggie's ""Life After Death."" You must pick up this album."
4,Still the greatest,"No matter what nas does now, it will be scrutinized. no this is not a ""5 mic"" album, but it's not the rediculous 2 stars that allmusic.com gave it either. they just lost all credibilityTruthfully, the lyrics on stillmatic are no up to par with his first three albums, but even nas at less than full power is still good. but the production has indeed improved. Tracks like your the man and the flyest and second childhood are mellow and should bring back memeries of his earlier work. Even some of the lesser song such as braveheart party are listenable, even if they aren't spectacular.This is definatly worth the purchase prics, even if i think it is his third best Cd. Contrary to what critics say, nas never went anywere, and he proves with stillmatic he is alive and well."
5,stillMOREILLMATIC,"This CD is a must have if you like rap period. He literaly TEARS Jay-Z up on the track ETHER and just about every song on here is very good, from Got ur self a... to One Mic...Your'e da Man. Its all good even if you are a hard core Jay-z fan I like Jay-z but NAS is a whole lot better. -""...you love 'my' style.."""
5,TRUE HIPHOP AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE SECOND COMING!!!!ILLMATIC ALL OVER AGAIN. This ALbum is tight I have the bonus track circuit city version, I think it's his most complete work. ILLMATIC is a CD that can't be duplicated, so people shouldn't compare it to this. Hip HOP fans gotta realize from 0-20 went into illmatic. it was written was tight, I AM ok, Nastradamus album was a album that was freestyled he didn't write it he went in the studio and freestyled it. Stillmatic is crazy PEACE AND BLESSINGS TO THE GOD.I don't mean to bring up jay Z but IN MY LIFETIME WAS WEAK, VOL 2 WAS A Compilation, Dynasty a Compilation. he FINALLY DID A ALBUM with NO FAMOUS GUEST APPEARANCES. NAS IS THE TRUTH .PEACE TO THE GODS AND EARTH, KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING"
4,THIS ALBUM IS GOOD,"I NEVER LISTENED TO NAS TILL I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM. I WAS HOOKED ON THE SONGS ""ONE MIC"" AND ""GOT UR SELF A GUN"" AND ""EITHER"". AFTER I LISTENED TO THE CD I WAS LIKE WOW THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. SO NOW I ISTEN TO NAS AL THE TIME."
5,"blood of a slave, heart of a king","This album is great it made him ""ill"" again (he was ""ill"" with all of his albums but he just lost something after ""illmatic"") he just started spitting the same [stuff] as he did with his debut.But still this album isn't as good as ""I'AM"" just because for the track ""braveheart party"", wy did he made it (what was he thinking). But it does not destroy the album because there are lots off classics on the album:""ether""(jay-z went down from this one),""one mic"",""you're the man"",... One thing i do not like for the album are the diss-tracks, such songs are for mix-tapes but the diss-songs have such great beats that i can't stop liking them. In europe we also have 2 more bonus-tracks:""everybody's crazy"" & ""no idea's original""(on this album it has a better beat then it has on ""the lost tapes""). If i could discribe this album with one word it would probably be: ""STILL"". This album is great buy it."
5,NaS-Too bad he doesn't have Jigga's Production,"If NaS had Jigga's production, he would be the tightest ever. NaS'flow is sick, and he shows his abilities on tracks like ""Ether"", ""One Mic"", ""Rewind"", ""2nd Childhood"" (the illest song of 2001), ""Got Yourself"", ""You're da Man"", ""Mentality"", and ""Stillmatic"". Its too bad the rest of the tracks are just good, because I was ready to say this is the best album I've heard since Makavelli came out.Back to Jigga: Jigga's flow gets worse every year. The Blueprint, which is far inferior to Stillmatic, shows how good Jay's production is. Jigga's rhymes and flow is straight up infantile on some verses, and I just have to laugh at some of his wack rhymes. I was so happy I didn't buy that album...someone gave it to me for free. Thank god."
5,Nas.. Thats all,"One of my favorite Nas albums, and he never disappoints. If you like Nas (I don't see why and how you couldn't if you listen to rap) you have to get this genius album."
5,Ill Will! Illmatic (Pt. 2),"Wow! Nas has finally made another Illmatic! This time around, he shows his maturity and his wiseness in the rap game! Tight lyrics, tight production, and overall tight comeback! He's STILL ILL!"
5,how did he do it,wow lets see this album is great it i bought it pretty much knowing it would be cool but when i listened 2 it was what i was awsome i pretty much haven't stopped listining 2 it its 1 of my first in my cd case i usally listen 2 but between him and jay z its a tie i like them both
3,Not all that and a bag of potato crisps,"I often wonder who, or what, for that matter told Nas to change from the bling bling style. I was so proud of this chap for his ""Nastradamus"" release, that was a true work of art.Unfortunately with the release of ""Stillmatic"" Mr. Escobar returned to his old style, the one that I despise the most. Instead of bragging about his jewelry he speaks of ghetto struggles.I recall the day ""I am"" came out, I thought maybe Nas was going to present a style that is truely enjoyed by real hip hop fans, especially since he had P. Diddy on one track. And like I said, ""Nastradamus"" was the bling blinging masterpiece, it showed extreme growth.But what is this? Real hip hop? I am quite ashamed that I bought this Compact Disc indeed! ""Got yourself..."" was somewhere near okie dokie, but everything else was to raw and real for me!Yuck!"
5,Get a Heini and Black and listen. Its that crucial.,"It is the first Rap album I've really loved since ""Life after Death"" and ""It Was Written"" and ""Wutang Forever"". I liked ""Murder Music"" (Prodigy in particular)and ""Supreme Clientel"". I like all of Jay-Z's recent albums. ""Stillmatic"" is a step above everything thats come out for at least 3 years. I think Jay-Z motivated Nas to come with his best. Stillmatic is inspired. I think it is a Classic."
4,Great Album,This album is not as good as Illmatic but it's very close. The production is good and the lyricism is even better. I'd say that this is one of his best albums (following Illmatic and preceding It Was Written).
2,Wake me when its over....,This CD could of been much better! Nas has nice lyrics but the production on this CD is ugly. The first three tracks are bangers but after that you might as well throw in his first CD (Illmatic). (...)
4,"Stillmatic: Hotter than most, but still not quite Nas","Nas in my mind, is not the King of New York. Illmatic was an absolute classic. However Nas's constant bragging needs to be put in check. Nas is a gifted lyricist, i'll give him that and at times he can be intelligent, but put up to the likes of Biggie, DMX, Jay-Z, Jada and his crew the Lox, Nas isnt all that. Stillmatic is dencent and has its moments. Though the Mega trife is gettin old. Nas better than Mega, maybe... But Mega's ""The Realness"" is much better than Nas's post-Illmatic releases."
2,No Illmatic,"When I heard Nas was coming out with Stillmatic I thought it was going to be he best CD yet. But when I heard it, it wasn't close to Illmatic or Nastradamus. I wasn't feeling most of the beats and the rhymes were not that great. This CD should have been a lot better."
2,pride before a fall,"another wack album from nas.marginally better than the previous opus nastradamus just.to quote cormega nastradamas flopped this time you got lucky.the beef with jay-z obviously woke nas up and forced him to step up his game and thus stillmatic contains flourishs of genius but again suffers from dismal production and half thought out rhymes.standout tracks include stillmatic,ether,your da man and 1 mic.dispite the album being entitled stillmatic nas proves that lightning seldom strikes twice.not as good as illmatic by a country mile."
3,Not the King of New York,"I am not a Nas fan. I don't like anything by him. To me Jay-Z is the King of New York since Biggy died. But when I heard Nas's record Ether, I was SO shocked because he was going off on Jay. I heard Jay-z's song against Nas, but it wasn't as crucial as Nas. I heard the song and I said Nas won that battle. I remember him saying that he has a mustache while Jay-Z has whiskers because Jay doesn't have a mustache or a beard. Another part is when Nas said he Roc-hoes and Jay-Z Roc-fellas. He also said Foxy Brown got him hot because he keeps his face in her [...]. After that record, I thought that Nas was alright."
4,Love Him or Hate Him,"Love him or hate him. Nas fans, this is one you have to have in your collection. Don't sleep on it, there are nice cuts. Take a minute to really listen to it. Got ur self a ..., You're da man, One mic, and even Rewind ain't nothin' any Nas fan should miss."
5,Still da Flyest,"Yall, the true ruler is back! No, Stillmatic can't really be considered an ""Illmatic 2"", but my man Nas keeps it gangsta and shows the world that he's arisen from the trenches of commercial rap. I got dis Lp in late December and still listen to it almost everyday.Most of the tracks on here are pretty tight, excluding one (Braveheart Party, basically a club track, like ""Oochie Wally"", which stands out as a BAD song). Besides that, all of the songs are vicious, some better than others, lyrically and productionwise. In my opinion, from the best, the tracks are:1.One Mic2.Intro (this should have been a song)3.Every Ghetto4.2nd Childhood5.Poison6.My Country7.You're da Man8.Rewind9.Ether10.Destroy & Rebuild11.The Flyest12.Smokin'13.Got Yourself A Gun14.Braveheart PartyAnd like I said, they're all good, just different. If Nas makes another LP, I know it'll be tight. He's moving away from dat Nastradamus attitude and back to Nasty Nas. Good job!"
4,God son across the belly,"The only track that i wasn't feelin was Braveheart party, I liked the rest. About the whole Jay-Z thing, whatever man, Jay-Z sampled his voice...enough said. I'm sorry Jigga, but after you do somethin like that, don't diss the man. And you're desire to be in the Firm, damn dun. Mega put the only album that can compete with Nas' and his album was spoiled by all the nas references. Prodigy, I'm not so sure about. Nature I don't agree with, but whatever. But someone woke nas up. Good. One mic, you're da man, my country, rewind (genius), poison, etc. Damn...holla...But no illmatic, which is the only album i'll ever give a 5, that and maybe wu tang, enter the 36 chambers. Peace"
4,"good cd, but not illmatic","this cd is really good, but nobody can even compare this wit illmatic, be serious. besides illmatic and it was written, this cd is probaly the best. i am.. was decent and nastrodamous sucked big horse c*ck, god's plan was missin some stuff and his new cd streets disciple is coming out in fall, ill probaly cop it. back to stillmatic. this cd is hot and deffnitely has the best intro song(stillmatic intro song is hot)here is my top 5 songs on dis cd in order. 1)every ghetto(this is hot song,sick beatand lyrycs, thank god for this bonus track.)2)got urself a gun(nice beat and just an overall hot song.)3)stillmatic the intro(i already said this is hot, im serious, heart of a slave blood of a king.)4)1 mic(u noe this already, i dont have to explain it,)5)ether( not as hard as jasy's takeover but a pretty nice shot at jay"
5,Stillmatic- True,"Basically, Nas has reinstated himself as a legend. No doubt after illmatic he started to fall off but Nas has resurrected. He bounces back from Jay-Z's talk by making it clear that Jigga is clearly inferior. Then motions to create a flavor of hip-hop that only Nas could establish, putting all the skeptics in their seats. Stillmatic indeed, Nas is too nice for the media's emcee, a.k.a. Jay-Z."
3,"For a NAS cd it is ok a 3, for a normal rapper it is a 5","I am a huge Nas fan. I love nas, he is the best rapper ever! No one even comes close not even biggie or 2pac. This recent cd is a good nas cd. It is an excellent cd for any other rapper. The best songs are rewind and posion. I cant understand how some of these people writing these reviews can honestly give this 5 stars when it is nas's 4th maybe 3rd best album. Illmatic is a 10, it was written is a 9, I am and Stillmatic are both around a 7. And i am not even gonna go into Nastradamus. Stillmatic is a good album, if u like nas buy the album. But if u really like nas check out it was written (the most underated cd of the 90's) and the obvious Illmatic which is the best cd ever. Whoever tells you this is better than Nas's first 2 albums is crazy. Maybe better than I am but thats it. Nas really is ""half man, half amazin"" - It ain't hard to tell (illmatic)."
5,He's Back,"Nasir Jones has been through a constant struggle ever since the release of classic album Illmatic fans have been expecting Illmatic for the last three albums.But for all you Nasty Nas fans he has come back with the superior Stillmatic from the on point ""Stillmatic"" where Nas shows his superior rhyme skills that made fans proclaim him to the throne to the Jay-Z disfest ""Ether"" where Nas gets at Jay-Z with vicious lyrics that get Jay and Damon Dash. Nas also shines with ""One Mic""where is flow goes from a whisper to a yell all with the precision of his rhymes.Nas also destroys Prodigy,Cormega,and Nature on Destroy and Rebuild. Nas shows his commitment to social upliftment on Poison,Everybody Wants to Rule the World, overall this album should put Nas back on his lyrical throne and set a precedent for other rappers in making a classic album."
4,Nas narrowly misses the mark,"This cd is pretty tight, but he can't compare musically or lyrically to Young Hova. It jumps off quickly with a the bangin ""Stillmatic Intro"" Nas spits hard over a dope Hangmen 3 track. The Jigga diss track ""Ether"" is half-assed in my opinion.The beat is harder than granite, but let's examine some of the lyrics since most people say he disses Jay better. Calls him Gay-Z, calls him ugly, makes fun of his facial hair, what is this second grade? In my view, Jay-Z only needed one venomous verse to get at Nas. Nas didn't diss Jay better, he just dissed him longer. Round 1 goes to Jay. My favorite track on the album is ""One Mic"" because I'm really feelin the energy and rawness his displays. Other hot ones are ""Got Urself a..."", ""You're da Man"", and the conceptual ""Rewind."" This is no Illmatic, not even close, but Nas does deliver some very good hip-hop when the industry needs it most."
3,NOT-Matic!,"Just out of interest I had a quick browse of the other reviews here and could agree with only one of them. No this is not 'Illmatic', but also no, Nas is no longer 'Stillmatic'. Being an original Nas fan from one I (and a million others) have been awaiting his return... Nah, it ain't happening. Stand outs are the Jay-Z dissing 'Ether', 'You da man', '2nd Childhood' (wicked premo track) and a couple of others. The rest... Nah. When you are attacked with the venom that Jay-z hurled at him, and when you listen to the album Jay produced, Nas should have upped his game. Unfortunately, it's only marginally better than 'It was written', which in Y2k2 simply isn't good enough. I'd give this 2.5."
5,He's Back,"Finally the return of the Illmatic Nas. Conscious raps with time put into each line. ""Ether"" shows Jay Z whos the king with hilarious rhymes. ""Rule"" and ""What Goes Around"" show his knowledge and awarness with some positivity. Az joins nas on ""My Country"" for a talk about america and its state. Probably the most superb song from this album would be ""one Mic"". Lyrics filled with emotion and intensity running over a phil colins beat has you whispering ""all i need is one mic"" everytime you listen. If you liked nas on Illmatic, you wont necessarily like this album though. Nas comes equipt with rhymes but the beats and the hooks have a mainstream sound. I personally love it."
2,"A lot of scales, no text.","I thought this would be a book with some explaining text, but it wasnt. So if you wanna practise scales and dont need any explaining text or input, history, etc, this is the one. If youre looking for a book explaining scales and want some more info, history, ways to learn to remember scales and so on, look for something else."
3,"Good resource, BUT....","This is a thorough scale text that I know I'll get a lot out of. Why only three stars? The book comes with a glued binding that makes it nearly impossible to leave opened on a music stand without either destroying the binding, or paying extra to have it re-bound locally.Publishers, PLEASE consider usability of your products when you re-print. Cheaper is not necessarily better!"
2,Intensly boring!,"I am an avid reader of Avi and so when I had to read this book for a class assingment last year i was absolutely thrilled. But, by the rating that I gave this book, you can obviously see that it was a big dissapointment! I was falling asleep through the whole book, even during the part where they go into battle! I was especilly dissapointed because usually Avi's works are very gripping. I recommend that unless you have to read it under the circumstances I had to read it in, don't read this book!"
3,"A good to read book, sometimes intensely boring.","This book was good in some parts like when they actually got to the war. Otherwise, this was to boring for me. The 24 - hou thing was very, very stupid. I mean, how stupidly often do you come across a book that takes place in 24 - hours? Totally different. And the main idea and story was very dumb. Which boy in 1777 thinks about going to war? He knows he's going to die. Jonathan had no sense at all."
2,unsatisfyed,"I agree with the other reviews that said this book was boring. We are reading it in class and I am not very happy w/ this book, especially because I am a huge AVI fan. I'm disapointed and though I recommend a lot of other AVI books, especially Something Upstairs and The Man Who Was Poe, but I sadly do not recommend this book."
1,BOOOORRRIIIINNNGGG,"We had to read this 50 page ""novel"" for English. I don't know anyone who enjoyed this 5-week torture book. I enjoy Avi's stuff, but come on! Give me a break!! DON'T BUY THIS!!! -A disgusted young author who's expecting better things from this particular writer."
3,The Small Unexpected War,This book called The Fighting Ground by Avi is a very good book to read. It is about a boy name Jonathon who is 13 years old. He really wants to fight but his dad wont let him. One day Jonathon is working in the field with his dad when he hears the war bell. He runs home and his mom tells him to go see what it is. When he goes to see what it is he runs away with 13 other men. The neat part is that it happens in a day. If you like to read war bookis I recommend you read this book.
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!!!,"The Fighting Ground by Avi is an awesome book. It went by minute by minute and always had you on the edge of your seat. It is very discriptive and easy to picture, it was like watching a movie in your mind. This is my first Avi book and definitely not my last. Anybody that would give this a bad review must have been reading another book."
3,a great non-stop reader,The Fighting Groung was the kind of book you had to finnish to find out what happens. From the very start of the book has excitment to the very end. It gives you a good picture in your head of what is happening in the fights and in his head. You can put yourself into the character.
3,The fighing ground,I gave this book *** stars becuase I didn't really like how he had the book taking place in the time like at 2 o'clock and it is based on a day and half so but I really didn't like that but how Johnathan was on other side and was really weird but for the rest of the book I really like it (a little)
3,The Fighting Ground Rating Response,"I give this book only 3 stars because I didn't really get into it very much. Everything went by rapidly. One thing I did enjoy about THE FIGHTING GROUND, was that every character expressed a different amount of emotion and feeling. It described most of the things everyone was experiencing.And it showed real feelings that a person in Jonathans situation would be having. I liked most of it, but some of it wasn't really what I expected it to be. I also liked that it had the same opinion as myself. It represented an anti-war book."
1,"Hey, Hessians aren't so bad after all . . .","An important part of every American kid's education: Read a little about the War of Independence. You know, minutemen, Bunker Hill, George Washington, grit at Valley Forge, British surrenders at Saratoga Springs and Yorktown.But, don't expect to find it here. This is not about the courage of Americans who faced British, Hessians, Iroquis and loyalists. In this story, only one American is clearly devoted to victory against the British empire and its hirelings, and he's vicious. Other Americans? Kinda cowardly. And the Hessians? Not bad guys, really.A much better story for kids to learn about Hessians in the War of Independence:Woods Runnerby Gary Paulsen."
2,The Fighting Ground by Avi (Erick from the Bronx),"The Fighting Ground by Avi is a good book but not for me. Well there was a boy named Jonathan and he was a 13-year old boy living in the 1770s. His dream is to be a soldier and fight in a war. Almost all of the men in his family are in war or went to war. ONe day he heard the tavern bell calling the men to fight. So Jonathan went without his father's permission and joined the army to fight in a war. Jonathan does not know what he is getting into, or does he?The book The Fighting Ground by Avi is a good book but not for me. You ask ""why?"" Well, it's because it is a war book and it does not have a lot of action.The chapter I like the most was when they kill all the Hessians in a pile. It was almost all the action they had in the book.I recommend this book to kids from 10-13 years old. Kids that like stories where kids like Jonathan get into trouble."
1,Worst Novel I've Ever Read!,"To make this review short, I hated this book! I'm presently in sixth grade, and my fourth grade reading teacher made me read this book. I found it terrible. I do not like war nor historical fiction books. I prefer to read funny books. This book was boring, too serious, and was not a happy nor funny story. I do not recommend this book unless you are a real fan of historical or war fiction."
2,The Too Friendly Hessians,"This short book goes through a day of war with a young kid. It's a fairly good story but it needed to say ""this is the Revolutionary War."" Young kids wouldn't necessarily understand that from the dates of the book.The first half has a lot of good detail, such as the heaviness of the gun that Jonathan, the 13 year old boy, is carrying, and how hard it is to load it. The second half is unrealistic. Jonathan is a prisoner to the Hessians. Later they all fall asleep and Jonathan escapes back to the Americans. For half of the book he is fighting for the Americans, for the other half he is doing good deeds for the other side. I feel that this book does not show what would happen in a real war."
3,an average book,I did not like how the begining started because it jumped right into the action right away.But iI did like the end of the book because I thought Jonothan's dad was goingto be mad at him for going in to battle but he was.That means I love happy endings.some things were ridiculis.Like when Jonothan surrendered to the hessians. But otherwise I liked the book!
5,The Fighting Ground,"In the book, The Fighting Ground, Jonathan wants to be a solder. His brother and cousin has already gone to fight with George Washington. Jonathan's family says he is too young and his dad needs help on the farm. Jonathan's dad has already fought and was shot in the leg.The tavern bell rang one day on April 3,1778. Jonathan wanted to go and see what was up. Jonathan's dad did not want him to go but Jonathan went any way.The style of the writing in this book is great. Avi's writing is not too complicated or too easy. He gets you up close and personal to the story. Avi also makes the scenes come to life. It's hard to stop reading once you have started this book.This is not the best book Avi has written but in this book he takes you through what war could be like."
2,My Opinion,"Jonathan is a 13 year-old boy who wants to join the Revolutionary War. His father will not let him but one day he found his chance and toke it. He realized that he should of listened to his father and stayed home for he would learn a lesson of a life time. The book it's self had a good plot but the fact that the book was over within 24 hours made the book seem long, dull, and confusing. How? In some chapters alot more happened then in other chapters. This book would have been good only if it spaced out the chapters and made the book last a few days or more and not just one"
3,not black and white,"For information on why this book was challenged and subsequently banned in Florida, check out the article in School Library Journal.My response: Attempting to ban any book that has even one instance of a word that could even vaguely be construed as ""profanity"" is just silly.In this book, Avi ably portrays the hopes and then fears of Jonathan, a young boy who suddenly finds himself fighting in the Revolutionary War. Even more interesting, after the battle is over, Jonathan is thrust into a morally complex situation where he must question which side he's on. Students will be able to sympathize with Jonathan's dilemma and will take away valuable lessons about how the world is not always drawn in black and white."
4,The fighting ground,"Jonathan is 13 and knows how to handle a gun. When he fights he learns what it's like to be in the army and to be a soldier. When Jonathan wants to fight his dad can't believe it, but that doesn't change Jonathan's mind. Jonathan goes to the tavern and the people think he is too young. When he is fighting it seems like he is older and can fight like a man. When the war starts he begins to get into more and more trouble. When the war ends it changes his life forever."
3,Another Reveiw,This book is about a thirteen year old who wants to go to war when his father is wounded. He runs away after marching towards some hessians. then he gets captured by three hessians overall i think this book was pretty intersting.
3,WOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!,"It told me how one battle could effect people just as much as a big battle. When John went to battle he thought it was a game and he was going to beat the bad guys. He thought it was going to be fun when it was his worst nightmare of pain, hardship, and hot lead."
3,An OK book for all ages.,"Overall, I think The Fighting Ground was an okay book. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. The plot took place over a 48-hour period, which made things a little more suspenseful. The plot was about a boy, Jonathan, who was very anxious to go to war against the British. As the time came, he went to go fight, ignoring his parents telling him not to, and ended up fighting the Hessians, not the British. In the end, I found the book to be slightly boring but if you're an avid Avi reader, you'll probably enjoy this book. Also anyone that enjoys reading about the Revolutionary War would probably like it."
4,Another?!,"another astonding book by Avi. i give it 4 because it was gory________________________________________________________________and a little boring, but this book is so great anyway. we read________________________________________________________________it in 5th grade and i love it. this book is so so so so so so________________________________________________________________neat.________________________________________________________________"
4,best book ever,The Fighting Ground is one of the best books I have ever read. I suggest you read this book. That is why I gave it four stars. If you don't like the civil war you may not like this book as much. I read it and so should you. The reason I liked this book is because I like reading about the civil war.
3,The fighting ground,"The fighting ground is a okay book, it teaches you a lot about the history and somethings about war. Fighting ground by Avi is about a 13 years old boy named Jonathan he always wwanted to fight and be a war hero then one day his opportunity to fight a real enemy the Hessians. But those 2 days change his fealing of war."
4,The Fighting Ground Rating Responses,"I liked this book because the author was realy exilent descrbtion of the charectors and the senere or how the charectors feeling. But I only gave it 4 stars because it had good describtion but I didn't realy like the war thing and everyone of Jonathan friends or, people deing. It wasn't what I expected,it was an anti-war,and nobody liked it."
2,This book was a fair to poor read.,This book was a bad book because the time was inconsistent page to page. A page would equal a few seconds in one part of the book but then on another part of the book a page would equal a few hours or days. Sometimes the book was to vague or unclear. It seems like he wrote this just trying to finish it instead of putting lots of time and effort into it like a writer should
2,Impossible to find fax paper,"Can't find this stuff anywhere anymore, but Amazon is picking up the slack. The fax paper doesn't last very long, but at least it comes 2 to a box and isn't expensive. Just need to keep it on hand and order when your down to one roll."
1,Buyer Beware,"Ok, I read the reviews and decided to buy this product. I waited for a package to arrive and instead a very small envelop comes... that's right an envelop. In it is a yet smaller thin plastic bag with a tiny sample like amount of this product. NO more than an ounce. I went back to the Amazon site and re read the product description. Guess what, no quantity or weight indicated. There isn't enough product for a doll house fireplace, let alone a real home fireplace. What really hurts is the 8 dollars shipping which is non refundable! This is a two postage stamp item.I am a big Amazon fan but this is the worst shopping experience I have had. [...]$ for one ounce, maybe less, of product plus 8$ more for shipping is tantamount to Fraud. I am embarrassed to admit I even bought this but i thought i should warn others...You will be burning up brighterPlatinum Bright Embersthan these embers when you see what you just wasted your money on."
3,Excellent Product!,"This item does just what it states,the life like embers looks very cool. I'm glad I purchased this product! The shipping charge for such a little box is to high. The directions were easy to follow and the product was new with a sealed bag. Very nice product"
5,Works as promised,I spread the embers as directed on top of existing materials. The product adds a realistic ash glow to my gas logs.
3,A Little (has to) Go A Long Way,"I agree with earlier review that the amount you get for what you pay is ridiculous. I did find the quantity to be just enough for my fireplace, but can't get over the excessive shipping fees. My first package never arrived, and I had to request that it be reshipped as, it was explained to me by the vendor, ""Your order must have been lost in the mail"". It took nearly a month to deliver.Though very expensive for what you get, I have to report that this product does result in a warm and lovely ember effect in the gas fireplace. I had read a hint that you can also rub these embers on ceramic logs to add to the effect, but I did not find that this worked. The embers would not stick to the logs and simply flaked off."
5,Works exactly as advertised,"I gotta say I was skeptical about the quantity, especially after reading one particular review. But the others were positive, so I took a chance. As another reviewer said, I only needed half the bag for my 24"" logs. The effect is nothing short of amazing. I've been burning wood in this fireplace for 22 years and, unless I look very closely, I can't tell these aren't real embers. I didn't appreciate how lame the original wool embers looked until I added these. I agree that $8 shipping is a bit on the high side, but the total delivered price was well worth it."
1,The worse experience I've ever had on my computer.,"I tried to download this product from Mcafee.com. I was unsuccessful. I went through the internet chat-- the only support available for free. And all I got was bogus solutions and lists of instructions over and over. None of them worked. When I told the technicians what I had already tried, they did nto appear to listen and told me to do the same things over and over. I am giving up. I will NEVER buy another Mcafee product again and will advise everyone I know of my experience. I spent hours and hours on trying to download this program. It spent three days on it-- days I will never get back. And my partner and I darn near divorced one another as the result of the frustration. Anyone interested in filing a class action lawsuit, let me know. I would be happy to participate. Mcafee has horrible business practice and their advice is a joke."
1,This product is a joke.,"This did not catch the virus that infected my system before it got in and could not locate it with it's Virus Scan after infection. I have turned it off because it's such a resource hog and I rely on the free protection that comes with my browser.I also could not get the rebate that was promoted when I purchased the product even though I provided the requested documentation and their customer service and help facilities are of little, if any, use. I advise everyone to stay away from this company and their products."
4,Effective protection,"I have used Norton AntiVirus with my computer before and got McAfee bundled with my laptop. I upgraded the bundled OEM version with 10.0 and so far I did not had any virus attack. Looks like it is doing the job its supposed to.One little problem is that during every system startup it does an autoupdate and it just takes another min of the startup time. It has blocked many online virus attacks nicely when I browse through websites.But looks like it wont block the ads. So I use the adsense (available free for private use through google) to remove adwares.Generally this has done a good job so far, just that you have to be cautious and make sure that it is always running and protecting your computer."
1,Not for slow processors,I upgraded to VirusScan 2006 (v-10) in October. I was hesitant to upgrade because I am using a 166MHz Pentium processor. The system requirements stated a 150MHz machine would work with Windows 98. It does work but what used to take a minute to download now takes 4 - 5 minutes. I would NOT recommend this product for anyone who has an older processor.
1,anti performance ware,Antiperformaceware will be the best name for this product. This software has used its best UI skils to irritate users will lots and lots of popups which will be stuck and make everything running stuck.I highly recommend this product if1) You are looking better option for throwing away money.2) Feel that your computer should not be as fast as it is.3) Have hobby of rebooting the computer oftenI hope that I'll at least get the rebate money. :(
1,This is a Virus itself!,"Have installed this P.O.S. (Piece of *) on 2 office computers and has given us nothing but problems.It updates almost every day and it took me forever to figure out how to update manually because they hide everything. There are so many pop-ups that you would think you have just downloaded and installed a spyware. Once I got figured out how to update manually (after 5 frustrating minutes), I need to go to their website and LOG-IN to their website every time I want it to update!Whenever I run some other programs or send multiple emails, it prompts me to allow it or block it. What the hell?I was so frustrated that I tried uninstalling it and did not realize that I had to disable the program from STARTUP before I was able to uninstall. I tried ctrl+alt+del closing everything McAfee but it wouldn't let me. I just saved you guys 15 minutes of work trying to figure out how to delete this McAFEE VIRUS. I'm going back to Norton."
1,"McAfee, Nyet","McAfee is pathetic. Their online help is useless, and there is no one to talk to. My recent McAfee 10.0 becomes a virus itself after awhile, and I have to remove it for my PC to work properly.I'd recommend avoiding this software like the plague.Ray"
1,Would not Buy,"The help chat, phone support and e-mail are unacceptable.I would not reccommed this product. I have an MS Degree in Computer Science, and this product has caused nothing but problems. I am writing off the $40 I have spent.This product does not allow you to have more than 1 system and register the software. I have bought numerous dell outlet systems that come with 90 day versions of McAfee Virus Scan. And I have one registered version of McAfee virus scan. The version I paid for cannot be installed on my new system."
2,VirusScan Disables Itself,"McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users' computers.With an anti-virus product, of course, that's about as bad a bug as you can get.In my case, the product disables itself every time I use Roxio's Drag-to-Disc.The forums at McAfee are full of different instances of this same problem."
1,Slowed to crawl,"Much as it pains me to dump something that is current and paid for, McAfee is such a system-hog that my computer existed only to feed VirusScan's unnatural craving for more system resources. This was once a useful, well-behaved program that got sucessively worse with each upgrade. I got use of my computer back as soon as I uninstalled it."
1,Very bad,"Software recently underwent a major upgrade which totally broke it, numerous problems with updates and conflicts between subscriptons. major security flaw in security center and patch has significantly slowed my system down. No tech support unless you pay through the nose for it. Symantec and Trend Micro both have their probs but are still better security solutions than this trash!"
1,You are buying a bug not a antivirus software,"By seeing the ad. in deals2buy.com, I purchased this software and it never worked, I installed thrice and end result is same. Tried to seek help from the customer care the only solution they provided was to reinstall and it didn't worked out and I ended up in sending it back. I made a mistake and wasted my time, Please learn from my mistake."
4,WTF?,"Some bands are hard to understand on the first listen. Not that their lyrics are hard to understand, though Mad Capsule Market's are unintelligable but hard to understand what they are trying to do. I had no idea what to make of the punk/thrash/techno/metal/jpop of MCM for a while, but I quickly figured out the answer... don't try to understand. Listen. Enjoy. If you like Dead Kennedys, SOAD, Rammstein, Dillinger Escape Plan, Deftones, Vandals, KMFDM, Pigface, you will love this album.I haven't played Quake online in years, but RL(pulse) makes me want to play all over again... it is definitely music to run around and shoot stuff up to.And to think... someone actually just gave me this disc..."
3,"Such a thing as ""heavy"" & ""fresh""?","Let's face it - heavy rock music has suffered in recent years. Sure there are ""new"" bands out their like Stained, but their sound is bland and their efforts disappointing to the mature listener. The heavy rock (dare we call it metal?) genre has lost a lot of ground to redneck rap/rock from the mediocre likes of Limp Bizkit & Kid Rock. This isn't the case with Mad Capsule Markets. In OSC DIS these guys put down a heavy and fast rock sound - almost a ""future savvy"" type metal which possesses a large, aggressive sound, yet is refined with a sophistication and maturity that is lacking from current ""heavy"" acts - especially those here in the US. They do their genre credit - and you won't be embarrassed adding this CD to the rest of your grown up collection."

5,When Your Heart Is Weak,"I know this sounds crazy but, in the mid-80's I heard ""When Your Heart Is Weak"" only a time or 2, but could never get it out of my mind. It haunted me for years. Fast foward 22 years ... walking into a Champagne-Caviar bar at the Ferry Building in San Francisco ... this song is playing!!! It took my breath away!! The bar tender was gracious enough to show me the cut on the ""Excellent 80's"" CD set. If you can remember a song you hear only a few times after more than 25 years... that's what I call talent! I am sorry to say that the U.S. was deprived of not having been exposed to this band as much as ""Duran Duran"". Our loss, Anna La Cazio and Peter Kingsberry!!! You are a classic!!!"
5,Features great emotion,"This is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Although I don't normally favor electronic soft rock music, the emotion expressed in this CD is exceptional and compelling."
3,KEITH GOES BIGTIME,"BEING A KEITH LISTENER SINCE THE ULTRAMAGNETIC DAYS, I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THIS VENTURE IS UNDOUBTEDLY OF A HIGHER PRODUCTION VALUE, BUT THE UNDERGROUND ATTACHMENT IS SOMEHOW MISSING. LYRICALLY AND TOPICALLY SIMILAR TO HIS INDEPENDENT PIECES, THIS CD FEATURES APPEARANCES BY SADAT X, AND ROGER(ZAPP AND ROGER), AND A MAINSTREAM FEEL HIDDEN BUT EVIDENT, SECRETING FROM HIS ""ASTRO"" LYRICS AND LANDSCAPE. OVERALL, STILL BETTER THAN 90% OF CURRENT RAP RELEASES, BUT THE KEITH OF PAST DAYS WILL ALWAYS REIGN SUPREME. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ""KEITH"" ANYMORE..."
3,"""MTV, Level Three When I Fly on BET...""","Black Elvis is a fantastic creation for Kool Keith as an alter-ego and hopefully the forthcoming independent ""Black Elvis 8000"" proves worthy of the mastermind's creation. This release comes close, but it seems as if the big label was unable to team Keith up with the right producer. Continuing the prominent themes of futuristic fiction and industry satire, Keith moves through a quick paced record that is full of robotic sounds that impress some and try others. There are gems on the record and all in all it is very listenable, but this is not the man at his finest. This album is worth buying, but only for more avid hip hop collectors. Dependent upon your tastes, ""Critical Beatdown"" (old school lovers), ""A Much Better Tomorrow"" (widest appeal), ""Dr Octagonacolgyst"" (the best one, also the most ""trip-hop"") or ""Sex Style"" (more mainstream hip hoppers) are better choices."
3,Not really up to KK's standards,"Even being a big fan of Keith's all the way back to the Ultramagnetic MC's days, I can't get into this one. It's funny to me that 'Dr. Dooom' is so good, and this one is so average -- given that they came out within weeks of each other. The rhymes are alright, but they tend to lean too far into angry complaints, full of invective against biter mc's and the commercialized industry at large. The beats are not that great, especially compared with the work of DJ Qbert and Dan 'the Automator' on the Dr. Octagon project. I think Keith can do better than this."
4,4 Star Effort,Great album. Kool Keith is an amazing rapper. This album also offers great beats to go along with Kool Keith's incredible and crazy rhyme style.
2,Poor Production ruins this CD,"I'm a big Ultramagnetic Fan and have some of Kool Keith's solo CD's, but he definitely lost me musically on this one. As always, lyrically he keeps it original. He makes sure there is no way to compare hi to someone else. Honestly, outside of the ""Girls don't like the Job"" and ""Static"" (w/Sadat X), I'm not feeling this joint"
1,"It hurts me to say anything against Kool Keith, but...","This is an awful album. Of the four KK albums I have (Octagon, Dooom, Sex Style, and this), Black Elvis is by far the worst. Not just in comparison to the fantastic work that Keith has done before, but by almost any objective standard. His flows are ok, but the pale in comparison to what he has done on the other fine albums I have mentioned. Additionally, the lyrics on this piece are strangely tame. Unlike the other albums, there are few lyrics you will ever repeat to yourself and marvel at their genius. Furthermore, Keith's tendency to have repetetive chorouses becomes completely unbearable on this album. I swear that half of the CD is taken up by him repeating the same nonsensical phrases over and over again. Get any one of the other albums I mentioned, but please stay away from this one. It is utterly worthless."
4,Love it long time,"A classic bass booming album, my first one was stolen so when I saw this I had to get it again, I'm old school I need the physical and this album really got me to check out the underground and alternative rap rather than the mainstream!"
3,Three and a half really,"This is a cutie and a cosy although does not rank anywhere near the stratospheric heights of this author's Ballad series of novels. However, Elizabeth's pre-nuptial exploits are fun and entertaining for a quick rainy day read."
3,not her best,I have many of Sharyn's books and love them but this one was way below par. It was slow and very boring. It is mostly about Elizabeth getting everything ready for her wedding & her cousins who are weird. The jest of the book that was any good at all was at the end of the book. I almost put it away more that one.not my favorite
3,great,The way she swapped point of views was aboultly wonderful. I enjoyed how she could swap between people and how easy it was to folloe that.
3,Good quality rod rack with limitations,"I found this module for the Rubbermaid Fast Track system to be good but with limitations. Overall quality of construction was excellent. This rod rack works well for reels up to medium capacity. For large capacity surfcasting spinning reels there isn't enough spacing between the circlular holders to accomodate more than one or two. Otherwise, this accessory is pretty darn good."
3,???,"as i grew up on d2 and they sure wrote the soundtrack to my summers as a teen and to my life also, i still really don't know if i really like this disc or not? sure there are no ted on voclas. sure paul is a great singer as well, bust the songs on this cd really is'nt d2, way to much grunge without being grunge if you know what i mean, some songs are great while some i don't get afer all those years. if you are going to buy a d2 cd with paul on vocals i should go for the ""gildersleeves"" disc!"
5,How Pizza Came to Queens,This is a wonderful book that my children have enjoyed since they were much younger. The illustrations are colorful but the text is superb.
5,Beautiful watch and unexpensive for the value,I like to shop at Amazon I saw this watch on another site so I went to amazon I found it there. Very please with this watch and it's very beautiful. Plus there's a great customer servive with amazon.
2,"Nice Package - Nice Looking Watch, not the best quality.",Just after peeling all of the plastic off the watch the front bezel fell off. I took it to a jewlery store and they were suprised and I will be asking Amazon for a replacement. If the next one is defective I will be looking at other brands.
4,Good looks on a budget,I get many compliments on the watch when I wear it out and people are surprised when I tell the about the brand. So far it has been an accurate time piece and comfortable on the wrist.
5,great watch for the money,great watch for the value - its sporty and has qualities you'll find on more expensive time pieces.
1,HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!,"Bought this watch as a gift for someone who could not afford a new watch after their old one gave out. They were really excited when they opened the box. It looks beautiful! Unfortunately, the watch did not work. NONE of the side dials were operative -- they were all frozen in place. It was impossible to even set the time. Sadly, this gift became a huge disappointment and this person remains, now again, without a watch. It is a complete hassle to straighten out this whole mess. Not likely to purchase this watch again."
3,Doesn't work :/,"Just got the watch today. Beautiful watch, but mine came defective with the large second hand wandering and the chronograph feature not working. The little second hand is the one that should be always moving, the chronograph second hand is the big second hand. When following the instructions the little second hand would just blaze around when it should have reset. It was all rather silly really.However, Amazon is sending me another one with one day shipping. Here's to hoping the second one works. Beautiful watch, just bad Quality Control, or it's just my luck. Probably a bit of both really. Also, there's no point in sending the watch to invicta at a charge if it's defective out of the box. That's just poor customer service on invicta's part."
4,"Like it very much, but...","I can't read anything on it because of gold on gold on white and a really teeny date window that I can't see except with a magnifying glass.It is a very heavy, classy, stylish watch that garners raves from all that see it; however, I am returning it to exchange for the black dial. I might just see that one.Invicta Men's Speedway Chronograph Watch #S Series 9224"
4,This watch is very well made and cannot be beat for the price.,Watch need to have ths large second hand as the stop watch second hand instead of the little in one of the circles.
5,Nice watch,I was scared that the watch was going to be too small because I'm a big guy but that wasn't the case. Beautiful watch
1,Battery empty,Battery empty What is the solutionI need a new battery because the clock has no need of battery Please reply to me
2,Not completly happy,I understand some of these watches come with screws for removing links. This one did not it came with only small brads and the brads themselves do not secure the band and keep it from falling off of your wrist. I would not recomend any watch that has a band that the links are secured by links.
5,Invicta Mens's 9212 Speedway collection S watch,"I bought this watch and other Invicta watches as a gift for friends, and they all love them, reason why I keep coming back to purchase more and more."
4,good price for nice watch,"The price for this watch is really good. World of Watches has it for $149 and Amazon's price was roughly $80.00 The watch itself is attractive looking, and the gold really sets it off from a looks standpoint.The only drawback is that it is a quartz watch and as such the second had has tha quartz jump rather than a smooth movement as an automatic or non quartz watch would have."
2,Invicta 9212 Speedway mens Chronograph,Could never get the small dials to zero themselves and returned it. Otherwise it is a good looking quality appearing piece. Probably just got a bad example of the model.
1,ZERO STAR,"This is my worst watch ever. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE STRESS AND SAVE YOUR MONEY. This watch started changing color day 2, not only changing the gold colour but even the stainless steel. Nice looking watch but such a waste of money, i cant even give it out as a gift cos it looks all scratched up now. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY ON AN OTHERWISE GOOD LOOKING WATCH."
4,Great watch for the price.,"It's a great watch for the price. I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money. High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex. We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch."
1,Not a good experience,Unfortunately I had to return this item. It only looks very nice but I couldn't even adjust the time because the crown and the keys for the chronograph didn't work at all. However I had my refund very quick and I decided to go for a better known brand
2,Poor quality,"While this watch appeared to be a lovely watch. Within a few months of purchase, the stem locked in place and cannot be used to adjust the watch. Yes, there is a warranty. The watch, however, cost $60 on Amazon, and the warranty fee is $29 to return it to Invicta ( which happens to be located about 3 miles from my home, but they do not allow you to drop off defective items). It does not seem worthwhile to spend 50% of the cost of the watch on a repair within the first four months after purchase. Very disapointing!"
1,"Battery dead within 6 months. $28 ""return shipping fee"" to have it replaced.","I bought this watch for my boyfriend last year, and within 6 months the hands on the watch did not have enough ""juice"" to do anything more than quiver. Within a couple weeks of that, it stopped completely.I contacted Invicta about having it fixed, as it is under their 1 year warranty. They will fix it, yes, but I have to pay to have the watch shipped to their headquarters. I also have to enclose a check for $28 for ""return shipping fees"". This seems like a very expensive battery fix. The problem is, if you take the watch somewhere local to have the battery changed, the second another party than Invicta removes the battery cover, the warranty is voided. Seems to be a bit of a stronghold to me. Pretty bogus.All in all, until the battery gave out, it was a decent watch. I wish someone at Invicta had been willing to take even ONE STEP to leave me feeling like a satisfied, valued customer."
5,Beautiful watch!,This is my second Invicta watch and I was simply blown away by how good this watch looks!! It looks classy and expensive. The picture doesn't do justice in representing this watch. It's also thin unlike the other Invicta watch that I have. I use this watch for special occasions. Go grab one!
4,Don't buy it for the chrono.,"It really is a sharp looking watch and I like it. However, the Invicta's chrono does not utilize the second-hand like the Daytona does. In fact, it renders the bezel useless and there are no second increments on the little chrono dial because it is incremented every 5 seconds."
3,Invicta 9212 Mens Watch,"Was a little disappointed to have to order this watch 3 times. Got sent the wrong watch the first time. My replacement order went missing. Although we speak the same language somehow we got mixed up with returns, re-orders and a few promises made by Amazon. Re: my actual cost to return the wrong item was never fully re-funded. A $10 voucher promised to my account never honored. Commission costs by my bank over the 3 orders blew the actual cost of this watch to over $50 more then my initial order cost!However! I finally have the Invicta 9212 watch I originally ordered and I love it! Would recommend the watch to anyone in the world. It is a very smart looking watch both in a casual and formal engagement. A quality watch that has a robust and functional feel.I really hope someone from Amazon reads this review! The Invicta 9212 Speedway watch will live up to your expectations and serve you well!Just wish i could say the same about Amazon!"
5,Great Watch!!!!! Great Price!!!,My wife bought this watch for my birthday!!! I love it and already received many complements regarding this watch!!! Buy it because you will not regret it!!!
4,Great Watch,I love this watch. It has a really sophisticated look. It's an everyday watch that also looks great when you're out on the town.
1,Poor Quality,"Normally Invicta is a great watch. This one quit working after only a few weeks. Manufacturer charges $28 for them to process ""warranty"" repairs."
5,WHAT A FANTASTIC DEAL,I LOOKED AT THE SAME WATCH AND IT WAS $495.95 AT A LOCAL STORE>>>>I AM DELIGHTED WITH MY NEW WATCH>>>>I LOVE INVICTA WATCHES THEY ARE THE BEST>>>GREAT DEAL>>>>I WILL BUY AGAIN...
3,Not as Big As Advertised!,"Just got this watch today and it's a nice looking cheap knock off, that looks like a Rolex Daytona. I did a double take though when I first saw it because it's definitely not as big (44 millimeters) as advertised. It's more like 39 millimeters. I've also got two Festina watches (Breitling like looking) that are also listed at 44 millimeters. They dwarf this watch. Nice looking watch but definitely not as big as advertised."
3,invicta review,"While the watch is acceptable, it is not quite what I had expected. All of the dials work but they are not useful. The dial is hard to read. The watch is rather attractive and seems to be well made. The bracelet is well made and keeps watch secure on one's wrist. In comparing the price of the watch to others I would rate the price as a little on the high side."
1,whats up with the second hand movement ??,watch is beautiful well built but finally got it set and the second hand does not move and the chrono features do not work either??? what gives invicta looks fantastic [...]
1,Free Super Saver Shipping is VERY POOR!,"I ordered an Invicta watch on the morning of 9/7/10 which included free Super Saver Shipping. At 7:00pm on 9/9/10 the order still had not shipped and my expected arrival date was shown as 9/24/10. I changed the shipping method to regular ground, paid $4.95, and it shipped later that evening. Free Super Saver is a farce!Now, another 2 days later FedEx shows shipping was initiated, but it still has not been picked up by them.I have no idea where my watch is, but I do know one thing, I will NEVER order from Amazon again!!!"
2,Heavy to wear.,"Looking at the pictures, i was impressed and took the watch. But, I guess, its not worth for the money. Its heavy on the wrist and I always wanted to keep it on the desk rather wearing."
4,Invicta Speedway,"This watch seems to be patterned visually on the Rolex Datona with hints of Breitling style (due mainly to the logo.) To me, it succeeds in that way, which makes it a very attractive watch. Despite being one of the least expensive watches I own, it holds a high place in my collection of 40 watches. A really great value"
4,invecta,The watch was great looking but there were some light spots on the gold part of the watch band.They look like waterspots and will not buff out.Overall the watch looks good and so far it is working properly.
2,All good... but!!!!,"I liked the watch for a month until my son pointed out that the second needle is not moving symmetrical. Over all, it takes 60 seconds for the second needle to make one complete rotation, but there are seconds where in it will not move or it will move two spaces in one shot.. A bit annoying, had that been right, I would have gone for a higher rating..."
3,Bad gold finish,"I received by 07/29 this Invicta 9212 Speedway. I loved the model and also many people has good things to say, but unfortunately, in less than 30 days i returned this because the gold tone finish of the band metal was fading and turning into a stainless steel color, only wearing daily and never into the water...ONLY 30 days..!!! Come on....it's supposed that this finish should be last at least 2 years or more...."
5,Excelente Reloj a un excelente precio!!!!,"Recientemente compré este reloj y me ha parecido deslumbrante! tiene una excelente apariencia, con muy buenos detalles, hace un año y medio compré el Invicta Men's 6934 Speedway Collection Chronograph Black and Silver Stainless Steel Watch, y me ha salido bastante bueno (Excelente); así que me animé a comprar éste otro reloj, la combinación de sus colores dorado y plateado es bastante atractivo, aparte de eso Invicta produce relojes de muy buena calidad, con materiales para gran duracion.Simplemente, excelente elección."
5,Great Gift Item!,Great gift item. Looks classy & expensive. It comes in a bright yellow box which some may not like. I would definitely recommend it!
5,SUPERB WATCH,This watch is too too good and excellent quality.Real worth of money with all features.Like the design and quality.worth for money as compared to cost of watch.
5,Good Watch,"I've had this watch for five months, now, and it still looks and works like new (as it should). What more can you say about a watch? It looks good and all features work well. I now have two Invicta watches, and both of them are in the same category: BUY"
2,Design challenged,"This watch has hands that disappear in the busy face, the colors blend too much, and you have to look hard to see the time. It is also very heavy on the wrist."
4,SUPER PRODUCT,SUPER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE VERY GOOD SERVICES SUPER PRESENTATION I AM VERY HAPPY FOR MY PURCHASE INVICTA WAS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT
3,Not too bad,"I have this watch (amongst others) and it is of decent quality. The Mineral crystal here is still unscratched after about 3 years of service. The gold trim one this watch will tend to fade over time and I'm not crazy about the hollow end links, but what do you expect from a $100 watch. I would still recommend this as an inexpensive gift or something to wear daily as a banger watch."
3,Nice watch but not as expected.,"This is a beautiful watch. However, the chronograph function does not work. The buttons unscrew just like a regular one, except the big second hand does not stop once the button is pushed. It is like my other cheap watch. The reason I bought this watch was to have WORKING chronograph functions. The image and the watch look nothing alike. The hour markers at 3, 6, and 9 are missing. There are no little glow in the dark or gold pieces on it. The second hand does not hit the markers. It goes in between them. I feel like I have been deceived. Both products that I ordered (a watch kit was the other, which was the wrong item) have disappointed me."
4,Great watch.,It is a great watch and I have got very good compliments on how it looks. The price was also quite abit less than the local store had it on sale.
5,Men's watch,This was a gift. He loved it. And has had many compliments. Very attractive watch. Does have a very large band so had to have some links removed
5,Invicta mens watch 9212,"This watch is more beautiful than pictured and it has the feel of a very expensive watch, weight and all. It works absolutely perfect. I highly recomend this watch and any other invicta watch to any guy that wants a classy watch that does'nt break the bank. These watches are definitly worth the suggested retail. I know that these watches are reduced because they are last years models, but who's going to know the difference when you're showing it off. I am well satisfied."
2,Too small and looks low quality,The size was too small for me. I have large wrists and this looks very small on me. The appearance is not the usual high visual I get from as I did with my previous Invictas I have purchased.
5,Not a Rolex,"I love the Rolex Daytona, and this is OBVIOUSLY a copy. That's why I bought it. A great beautiful copy. I may buy a another one or two in different colors. You won't be disappointed. The ""feel"" of it on your wrist is a little rough compared to finer watches that I have owned....but really, for the money...wow! Until prosperity returns to the USA, I'm loving this. The Rolex has to wait."
3,No response from Invicta customer service,"It is a nice looking watch and I only have one complaint -- the hour subdial does not reset to zero. Yes, I read the instructions in the manual. In fact I also went to the Invicta website for additional information. After repeatedly attempting to reset the subdial I sent an email to Invicta asking for assistance. I have waited over a week for a response -- very poor customer service. I will give them one more week to respond. If I don't hear from them I will return the watch. Hopefully they read these reviews and will realize that not only are they on the verge of losing one customer, but prospective customers might look elsewhere after reading of Invicta's poor customer assistance department."
1,Do not buy Invicta two-tone,"I received two Invicta watches as a gift at the same time. One of them was the 9212, and it looked good out of the box. After you wear them 10-15 times all of the gold will start coming off the band. This did happen on both of them. I would never buy another Invicta that is two-tone."
3,It looks nice,"It certainly looks like a fine piece..the look is appealing. As some have said though, my time piece does not run smoothly at all. The second hand jumps all around...forward backward pausing. If you look at it, it's extremely distracting and disappointing. As far as the overall feel of the watch, it is on the lighter side with a ""click clack"" noise to it at times. For the overall price I am not distraught about it...actually pleased. For the price it is worth it to be honest. The terrible second time keeping is a major draw back however. If anyone has OCD..watch out"
3,great looking watch but. . ...,"The watch looks really nice.It feels like good weight and quality, but the one I got doesn't work 100%.The seconds start off ticking right but after half a minute it starts to tick back then forththen it almost seems like when you rev your car and comes back in placeI hope this isn't common for Invicta watches because I thought of ordering different watch"
4,excellent watch for the price,"Good looking watch, no doubt about it.Very happy with the purchase, bought it 1 month agogo for it!"
3,Invicta speedway collection chronographs #9212,"An elegant watch for the price, the band look and feel kind of cheap, the chronograph don't reset I was waiting a better quality but again for the price it's ok, this is my third Invicta I already did another order for another Invicta but taking this experience I'm making better choices than before (I hope)."
2,Returned.,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is probably my 4th invacta I bought and the quality of this watch is.. well.. poor. It does not compare at all to theInvicta Men's 10704 Speedway Chronograph Blue Dial 18k Gold Ion-Plated Stainless Steel WatchorInvicta Men's 1774 Pro Diver Collection Chronograph Watch. In terms of weight, material, functionality, and of course looks. To me this would be a good gift for a women, it is small, lightweight and it's not a horrible price for what you are getting."
3,OK take on the La Femme Nikita theme,This review is for the amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a decent take onthe La Femme Nikita theme. Lea Mornar is a contract killer who is weary of thegame and wants out. Her much older mentor/lover does not want to give her up.This film moves fairly slow with not much action but the last ten minutes arevery good. Lea Mornar is very good as the female assassin. This theme has beenplayed out in several other movies with much better results but this film is wellworth the VOD rental price. The VOD rental has English subtitles.
2,it looks better in picture,"it looks better in picture than in real, the head pice is no nice, is a kind of ugly to be honest."
1,Wrong cd inside,"The cd inside did not match the description of the cd advertised. I did receive a refund without having to return the product, so Amazon resolved it very professionally."
5,Great Sequel to B-Zone,"Al Voth's second book is a huge improvement over his first effort. The characters, including the hero, Nathan Burdett, are more developed, and the story line is more believable. There are several plot twists that keep the novel interesting, and compelling. The book is very hard to put down. As a side note, all technical details relating to firearms and hunting are technically correct. There is nothing that stops the flow of a story more than reading Hollywood style lies about firearms or inaccurate technical data related to firearms. This book contains nothing to stop the action. Five Stars."
5,Truely a shooters book,"I loved the book. As a competitive shooter, I found the book technically accurate as well as entertaining. I couldn't put it down. I ordered the the first book, ""The B-Zone,"" at the same time and read one after the other. I can't wait for the third book.You can tell Voth learned a lot about writing between the first and the second book. The quality of his text just keeps getting better"
1,junk,"We went on vacation, only to come home to a smelly kitchen. Our 5 year old Amana refrig. was not cooling, leaving over $300 in food and about a months worth of breast milk bad. Called Amana about it and they sent a repair person, which we had to pay for. He told us what the sales person already told us - the compressor needs to be replaced - a $650 repair, not covered. I would not purchase Amana or Maytag(same company) anything. They don't stand by their product and customer service is a joke."
3,Med School Wannabee,"THe book does a poor job of reviewing the information material. It only delineates a small portion of the information necessary. Other books are available and I really recommend Cloumbia Review, Kaplan, Flowers and Peterson's for tests and information. But the MCAT tests the book offers is truly a rigorous work of art. It does not fully alighn with MCAT questions;however, it makes you think and conceive the questions in your head. I took the MCAT a second time with using this book and I scored a 35. Maybe it was the book and Columbia review that really assited me, as well as a lot of tireless hours over 6 months."
1,Thank god I'm not the only one!!!,"I worked through the 6 biological sections and found multiple mistakes. Eventhough my copy is from 96, they still haven't changed the test format in the 2000 revision. In fact all of the incorrect answers are still in the new book.A few caveats; 1. the review sections aren't the worst. I read through them for a general level of understanding. For any in depth information refer to a textbook. 2. The physical science section is difficult. However, if you can work through the tests it will help.."

2,Sean Coonnery Co;;ection,The collection was good except that audio for The Man Who Would Be King did not play on my dvd player. I returned it as soon as possiable
3,Like the old formula better for Dermal C,"I have used Dermal C for years and even though the smell wasn't the best, the product was. A renowned plastic surgeon in San Antonio, TX says it was one of the only products around that really worked. I noticed the new formula does not have absorbic acid even listed and has grapefruit peel oil listed close to the last of the ingredients. I'm using it but I can see the difference. One good thing about the last formula is that when you put on make up over it the makeup goes on very smoothly and covers fine lines."
1,Raunchy,I recieved this game for Christmas in high hopes for a fast paced game with real tricks.This game is by far the worst Xtreme sports game out there.It has raunchy graphics and the only tricks you can do are 1 grab or flips.The Salomon skates you start with don't even have grind plates but yet they find some way to grind nor do the bikes have pegs.
2,Not nearly as good as 2xtreme,"My family LOVED 2xtreme, so we were looking forward to playing this when I found it at a local game shop a few weeks ago. We were highly disappointed to find the graphics and challenges simply did not compare."
5,from wat i remember this was a good game,when i was lik 6-11 this game entertained me like alot i remeber it being fun as hell because i wanted to grow up nd b a bmxer or a proffesional skater (not skateboarder)which now i do both but im not a professionalnd took me forever to beat but im not the quickest person there is loli stoped playing it because i let my frend borrow it along time ago and he broke iti think im going to buy it againbtw im 16
4,Extreme 3 is cool!!,"The game is great. You can pick from skateboards,bicycles, or rollerblades to use. The graphics aren't that great and after a while it gets boring but it is a good game. Another thing is some of the secret characters are monsters and that is sort of [bad]. But overall it is a super fun game."
5,Fun! Fast Paced! Fab!,"This is a really cool racing game! You get to chose from tons of cool characters including: bikers, inline skaters, skaterboarders! You really can do awesome tricks you just have to figure out which bottons to push (it helps if you read the tiny manual!)! You can go on to different curcuits after you pass the first one and you onlock more characters that can do even more tricks! This game is really fast paced and it's hard to stop playing it once you get started! It's challenging too so you don't get bored or pass it too soon!This game rocks! The graphics aren't great but for this game, it really doesn't matter cause it's so cool!"
3,Good reference for the Greek Isles,"This small guide covers the essentials of island hopping in the Greek isles. Nearly every inhabitable island is covered, but in order to do this, depth is sacrificed. If wondering what island to go to, or if spending the summer hopping islands, then this will be helpful. If planning on one island, I would recommend a book concerning just that island and perhaps a general guide to Greece.My wife and I had a great time in Greece and look forward to going back."
5,A Great 20 Minute Version Of The Cask Of Amontillado!,"I have to say this is the best version of the Cask of Amontillado that I have so far seen! David Bielewicz, whom I also communicate with on Facebook, is a stunningly handsome Montressor and Frank Tirio Jr. is convincing as the drunken, haughty Fortunato! These are two actors who I am sure will make it to the top with their acting careers in the future. I give this 10 stars all the way if possible on here! See it if you are a real Edgar Allan Poe fanatic and want to see two actors who don't disappoint!"
3,If you love Venice...,"While I realize Urbino is annoyingly one-dimensional, the real star of this series is Venice, which is decidedly worthy of being extolled and enshrined in one's imagination. I have liked the entire series and look forward to the hours of wandering the city with a main character who does not distract me from this wondrous, decaying unique work of art."
3,A fair historical reference,"I'm not a civil war buff yet Bruce Catton's simplistic writing style and ""everyman"" vernacular made the subject easy to approach and informative without making it too technical or academic for me to enjoy. The chapters relating to the soldier Geyser and the war seen from his viewpiont and that of the engineers gave me a new insight as to what a monumental task moving an army in that day and age could have been. As well, it was interesting to see how both sides shared conversation, singing and other interests by night and then fought each other during the day, as brothers often do.I'd give it more stars but the 1981 paperback edition was not edited to it's best realization. Extremely poor syntax, misspellings and bad grammar in parts were somewhat annoying, especially coming from a Pulitzer Prize winner. These things could have been shaped up at the publishing house quite easily."
1,broken after one week,"I owned this product for about one week, very nice little piece which I can take to work or jogging, but today when I am copying some files to it from my computer, it stopped working, even reset didn't work, so I will return it for a refund and try different products."
4,"Good purchase, nice features for the $$$","Bought this as a gift for my ten year old daughter. She loves it. It has a lot of nice features that the IPODs in the same price range do not have. 2GB of memory seems to be plenty for my daughter. She loves being able to load pictures, and use the radio. Software is very easy to use. My ten year old is organizing playlists, downloading music, and ripping CDs.No problems mechanically. I highly recommend it."
4,Good features nice sound,I bought this for my wife. Wanted something that looked cute!!! It is compact. The headphones provided with it are not that good. But otherwise the sound quality is pretty good.It is easy to sync and use. No need to install any creative software if you only want to sync music and pictures. You need the software for videos.
3,Okay,"It was an okay product. Much better than my Coby. I used it to exercise and it fitted perfectly in my arm strap and was ideal for that. But now that I've moved on to my Ipod 6th gen, I just like that so much more."
3,It's OK,"I use only for the radio, songs and eBooks. You need to use the specific software to load music and books. It's not customer friendly and very often the program turns off with ' problems';also you can use only the computer where the software is loaded. Lately another very annoying problem developed. When I stop an eBook at certain time point and want to listen later, the time point is not remembered, and more over- it starts much earlier than I wanted to be and there is no connection between time and the content you listen. Maybe this particular brand has not been considered for eBooks. Otherwise, is good for songs and some radio stations.Charging the batteries takes too long time"
1,Display has quit working after three months.,"This is a nice player, but this one and a black Zen V Plus2GB Black/Green BOTH have a dead screen after three months. I would send them for replacement but when I contact Creative about the warranty I got this......RMA Fees & Details* According to the data you provided, your Creative product is beyond the standard labor warranty but within the 12 month hardware (parts) warranty.* The diagnostic and handling fee for products returned outside the labor warranty is US$25.00. To continue the on-line RMA process, you will need to pay the $25.00 fee using your credit or debit card through our secure shopping cart during this on-line process.So I have to pay one third of the product price to get it replaced through factory warranty, I don't think so."
3,convinient,"This item is very convinient for someone who just wants basic music. It says that it can hold up to 1000 songs which is not true because mine is barely at 300 and it's almost full. They also tell you it comes with 2GB of space, but that again is not true because it only comes with 1.8GB...you may say that it's only a difference of .2GB but that little bit of space really matters when you are running low on memory. All in all the Zen V 5 plus is a good thing to have...It's small so it fits almost everywhere and it's very easy to use.If you are looking for something to just put a few songs on then this may be the music player for u."
2,Disappointed,"Same experience as the previous reviewer. I read the review and hoped it wouldn't be a big deal. Unfortunately, it is a big deal. Having to reset the unit multiple times during useage is a nightmare. We are returning and going in a different direction. Aesthetically, nice unit, but the ""reset"" issue using a pushpin because nothing larger will fit in the hole is too much for me to overcome."
2,Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB,"This is the most annoying mp3 player, too difficult to use & I consider myself pretty good at this kind of thing. Too many programs and not enough information to help you out."
4,Great Intro to Rockettown Artists,"This CD is wonderful. You get a sample of all the artists on the Rockettown label, and a look into why they chose to record with Rockettown on the cover sleeve. I really enjoyed Shaun Groves' song, Welcome Home. It also includes Ginny Owens, Wayne Kirkpatrick, Out of the Grey, and Chris Rice. All songs that are already released, but this way you get them all together on once Cd. It's really great music."
3,White? Green?,"The picture appears to show a white box with black knob. The one I got was a very ugly green. Also, the knob ""pointing"" to the A or B switch doesn't really point accurately . . . you have to learn when it's pointing to A or B. It's not obvious. Other than that, the switch does what is says it does. I use it to physically break the internet connection when I'm not using it. Why? Hackers prefer to play with their skills when THEY want so they love the always on connection of most computers."
5,Great product.,"This product is very sturdy and complies with its intended use.I thinks it will last a lifetime.Regards,R. Atwell"
4,Does the job,"It's not sexy but it does exactly what it says it does. And, it doesn't cost as much as an electronic switch or need power. No sense in building a bridge to step across a creek."
3,Check ports before ordering,"Ordered this to have an ethernet, CAT5, RJ45 cable to share between two computers. When the package arrived, the ports on the back of the device were RJ11, a standard phone line jack. Product looked promising and was super sturdy and seemed to have been built great. Returned the product as it wasn't the product listed on the website. Just double check the ports you are going to be needing it for."
5,This is a great way to secure your home network.,This was designed to be a Ethernet A/B switch and works great for that. However I use it to disable my internet modem from my home network when I am not using it. It is much cheaper than other switches that I have seen before.
2,Beware - Dewalt has cheaped out,"I did my research on pressure washers and like the previous review I had found that the way to go was a Honda GX engine and a CAT pump. A local large retailer just put this pressure washer on sale. I went and looked at the display model and sure enough Honda GX engine and CAT pump. I bought the unit brought it home and opened the box. Now the pump area is surrounded by a plastic cover secured by Torx bolts (just to make it harder to take the cover off.) I pulled off the cover and there is some no name cheapo aluminum pump with ""Made in Taiwan"" stamped on it. I did not appreciate the bait and switch and wrote Dewalt a letter telling them so. Still haven't decided if I'll return the unit or keep it and hope for the best. Just wanted to let future buyers know, you may want to try a different manufacturer that doesn't put profit before quality.Tim O'Brien"
1,Honda pressure washers very over rated,I have had my Dewalt pressure washer for a year. Great price and service from Amazon but the Honda engine is very over rated. Hard to start and fuel system clogs very easily even with a can of the honda fuel storage added. I have already had to put a new carburator on it. what a pain!!!!!!
5,Found CAT pump version at Home Depot,"I got lucky last week! I happened upon one of these, in 'reconditioned' status, in my local Home Depot. It looked brand new, and the pump looked totally brand new and unused. Couple of scuffs on the gas tank was all. Got it, with CAT pump, for $475 with one year warranty! I love it. It is the washer I always wanted."
1,Dad's not happy,"Got my father this power washer for a present. The honda engine is terrible. Starts once. After first tank either will not start or if does, it does not stay running. Can't restart it. He always spoked highly of Honda engines and now they make his blood pressure go through the roof. Shame on you Honda"
2,Don't bother,"I hoped to kill two birds with one stone with this book as I plan to visit both Savannah and Charleston. I have only made it to Savannah so far, but found this book very sparse on information. There was only a very small section on Savannah which contained one lone page of restaurant listings. There was also only a small piece on Bonaventure Cemetary (two paragraphs), and the book did not include any maps or directions to get you to the cemetary and it is quite off the beaten track! I would recommend saving your money for real guidebook."
5,menino do rio,"A superb performance. High creativity. A ""fat"" sound. Pay attention to the tune ""Satin Doll""."
2,One out of the three did not play.,"one out of the three movies ""The Specialist"" did not play. Resolution is 1080p but was just like DVD quality. But for that price, I'll keep it and just buy the single movie ""The Specialist""."
5,Good intro to Law & Econ,"As one who both read this book and studied under Professor Ulen, I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the field. No, this is not a huge treatise on the subject, nor is it meant to be. It is designed to reach people familiar with either law or economics and broaden their understanding of the other field. In this, it succeeds quite well."
2,Too many tangents,"The book is a solid introduction to Law and Economics at the ""Microeconomic"" level. It surveys the standard topics in Law and Econ., e.g., Property, Torts and Crime. There are, however, a few too many topical sections whose relevance to the text is questionable. While some may enjoy random inclusions that do not have much to do with Law and Econ., I found them tedious. For example, sections on the death penalty and gun control are uninformative and are included, I feel, for completeness' sake. The textbook is not rigorous, so anyone expecting a complex review of the subject will be disappointed. However, it is a good introduction to a burgeoning field of study."
1,Stopper has drawbacks,"The stopper looks nice and matches the Chemex pot; unfortunately, it falls out easily and gets hot when in place. It does what it is supposed to but is not easy to use. I would skip this item."
3,Sits inside the chemex,"I thought that this would have had a tighter fit, but it is just a glass lid that sits inside the funnel of the chemex. Haven't left the coffee sitting out to get cold, so I don't know if the lid really keeps the coffee warm. I think the lid is better at keeping dust etc. out of the chemex when stored than keeping coffee warm."
2,"Looks Great, But It's Not Effective at Retaining Heat","Although this lid is made from a nice piece of glass, I found it ineffective at retaining heat with my six-cup Chemex pot. Previously I used an old insulated French press pot to keep my coffee warm. That was a much better solution. With this lid, my coffee became lukewarm after fifteen minutes. Too much heat escapes from the pouring groove of the Chemex pot. I was hoping for one less thing to wash every day, but this was mostly disappointing."
1,Too small,The lid sits to far down in the funnel so it is not noticeable when you go to pour that early morning cup of coffee and unexpectedly the lid spills out. Though admittedly after spilling the lid into your cup a few times you do learn to look into the funnel. But it does detract from the pleasure of the Chemex coffee preparation experience. A larger diameter lid with a notch to match the pouring slot in the funnel was what I was anticipating when I ordered it.
3,chemex lid,"It's a great lid for keeping the coffee warm in the Chemex maker, although I rarely use it since I drink my coffee right up. It's so miniature! I was surprised."
3,ESSENTIAL,chemex coffee pots should be ashamed to charge $11 for this on top of the pot.. especially when any left over coffee is iced cold w/in minutes without a lid
1,doesn't fit glass handle chemex,"the description says this lid fits all chemex makers, but does not even make it halfway down the spout on the glass handle maker. they should offer a different lid for that maker."
5,Quality,"Fits perfectly, looks gorgeous, keeps coffee hot for slightly longer. Very slightly. But I like it. Not necessary for the experience, but the whole glass appearance is so crystal clear and gorgeous, the light shines like it is white lightning, or a sheet of ice. Ride the lightning. Go on. Treat yourself. No one is watching.I lied. I was watching. And I approved."
2,Does not seal. Gets hot.,"I assumed this would lock in place. However, you must either remove it when you pour your coffee or hold it with a towel/potholder since it gets very hot. Not what I expected to do. A silicone seal and some sort of heat-proof(wood?) knob on the top would have been a much better design. Looks better than the filter full of grounds as a lid but to be honest, the grounds work better. Save your $."
5,Chemex Lid,I'm glad I read the reviews and purchased this lid. Fits perfectly on my Chemex Carafe - it is like the finishing piece.
1,Garage,"This album is complete and utterly devoid of creativity. People give Nasir Jones credit, but he is a ... If you want to hear a good album, check out the Blueprint by Jay-Z."
2,Design Flaw?,"Have had three lamps over past year. Unlike some other floor lamps I've purchased, this lamp does NOT let you pull through the excess cord in the tubing through the base. This is quite an omission in terms of design.When assembling, there is a great deal of excess cord which needs to be carefully pushed down into the tube to give enough room to screw the poles onto each other and the base. What results is a lot of bunched up, twisted cords that have given me a few months, at best, of service.One lamp actually blew a bulb simply turning it on. The others smoked and sparked while in use. It's obvious that the wiring is not very high-quality, and there's absolutely no excuse for that even at a low price.While it has neat safety features such as tilt-protection (the unit will automatically shut off if tilted), and an incredibly bright 300w bulb - I strongly recommended looking elsewhere for a floor lamp."
2,Okay while it lasted...,Unfortunately this didn't last very long in our house. I noticed it was leaking a few months after we bought it. But I wasn't too disappointed because my baby didn't really love it. Definitely not something I would purchase again.
1,Bust or just busted,First off the plug to fill the mat with water was almost impossible to open. Finally when I did open it I filled it with water and off the baby went to play. Not long after that I noticed the baby was covered in water their was a leak on it some where. Cool concept but not effective
4,"Not the tummy time miracle I was hoping for, but still a neat toy.","It is easy to fill this toy if you use the instructions other reviewers have written here. This does not come with instructions. My 6 month old hates tummy time so I thought this (like other reviewers have said) would be her magical ticket to enjoying tummy time. No such luck! She cries with tummy time just as much as ever. She does enjoy sitting by it and playing with it though. So, it's not the toy's fault. I probably would not purchase it if I had it to do over again, but it's not worthless as a basic toy."
4,Baby approved!,Babies love this-really. It builds their motor skills as they have their belly time. I always throw this in as a shower gift for every one of my friends. I should mention that filling it up with water is not the easiest function and a bit of a pain but well worth it.
5,"Great product, crappy packaging/instructions","My sons daycare has one of these mats and he seemed to really get a kick out of it, so I was thrilled to order one for him. Unfortunately it wasn't fulfilled by Amazon, so the shipping was quite slow and the box it came in was very beat up. However the product itself seemed undamaged and once I figured out how to fill it (thanks to Amazon reviews!) it was a breeze. My son loves tummy time on the mat and the cool plastic seems to feel nice on his arms when it's hot outside. The little floaty guys inside also hold his attention well. Overall, very happy with the mat!"
2,Great in theory,"The idea behhind this mat is great, however, the actual product was a bit underwhelming. First, without the assistance of the reviewer who explained how to fill the water portion, I'd likely have assumed it was just broken. Once explained, filling the water pocket was very easy. The mat is pretty small - my 9 week old could not fully fit on it, but he did seem to enjoy the different sensation. After 48 hours the air had leaked out of the outside ring and the fisg in the inner ring was being hunted by the cat. We move it to higher ground bur an additional 48 hours later and it had spring a leak."
2,"Cute Idea, but Baby not Interested","I ordered this for my 6 month old. Although a cute idea, my baby found this product very frustrating. He is currently into the stage of putting everything in his month, so after a few seconds of trying his best to get the fish out of the mat, he became very frustrated and moved on to another toy."
2,Not worth it,"Although my child thoroughly enjoyed this product, I believe it's probably safe to assume it contains BPA. Also when my child punctured it, I called the company, and I was told they couldn't help me. They wouldn't even send me a repair patch. My baby didn't even have teeth and he punctured it. On that note, I tossed it in the trash. I really thought it wouldve lasted longer."
1,Piece of Junk,This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever purchased! You've got to be kidding me ... no I instructions! As if it is that simple! Ridiculous and unprofessional is what it is! It's not even worth sending back! It should actually get NO stars but then you would not be able to submit the review!
1,THIS IS HOW YOU FILL IT,"First of all, here is how you fill it: Forget submerging the thing. Take it to your hose. Pinch open the large plug opening. Turn the hose on low flow and direct it into the opening. Voila. 10 seconds to fill.Now for the review: My 7 month old had absolutely no interest in this thing. Plus, it's not worth $10. Buy something else."
5,Such a cute little pond!,"My Son, who is 7 months old now really likes this pond. He can push on the soft parts of the sunshine and he slaps both of his hands against the water to make the fish move around inside. It is a nice size, it doesn't take up a lot of room. Perfect toy to take along to the sitters' also.I would recommend this toy."
3,nice toy but smaller than expected,"we purchased this for our 3 month old son and it was only about half his size so not really large enough to be considered a "" play mat"". we returned it for a refund easily and have no fault with the item. just beware that the mat is not the size of what i would normally consider a play mat as a 3 month old child is twice the length of this item"
1,Arrived damaged,Many of the reviews talked about the flimsy plastic but I decided to take a chance because it was low cost. This product arrived with a hole already in it! I would not recommend this product!
3,Good; not great,"The water mat is a good toy, but not a great toy. Air gets trapped within the toy making a huge air bubble. Therefore baby is playing with air bubble more than water. Baby still enjoyed though."
2,It leaked water after two uses,The product is cute and fun for new parents because of everything is at the time. We go this thinking our infant would love playing on it. He did. Only bad thing was that the product began leaking water in our floor after he played on it over two days. He was just starting to crawl. Good fun for our baby but it leaked so soon that I think it was just now well made.
4,seems to last forever,"Pretty basic water mat that we've had for almost 2 years now. My 18 month old still slaps it, though he's not as interested anymore. I would recommend it. It's fun!"
4,"fun, but frustrating..","It's very cute and works well, but my 6 month old daughter got frustrated because she wasn't able to pick up the the floating fish. I got a little frustrated trying to fill it. The valve is very tight, which is good because I wouldn't want it to leak once it's filled, but it took several visits to the faucet because my fingers got tired holding the valve open. I think it would be better for a little younger baby so I gave it to my friend who has a 3 month old."
2,WATER MAT TOY,I CHOOSE 2 AS A RATING FOR THIS ITEM AS IT WAS USED FOR MY SON FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN LEAKED. NOT RECOMMEND IT AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
5,Great for Babies development,My son got this toy when he was around 6 months old. Our Parents as Teachers advisor told us that pat mats were good for babies development. My son really loves smacking the mat with his hands and crawling around it and watching the toys inside move. I like this pat mat compared to others because it is easy for him to crawl all the way around and explore the whole toy.
3,how to fill with water,"Upon opening this toy we discovered that there are no instructions. We went to Amazon reviews to see if there were any tips. There were recommendations of pinching, using plyers, etc.All you need to do is submerge it in a tub of water.Raise the spout to be higher than the other end and you will see bubbles come out. I ended up blowing air into the large spout then submerging to get more water into it.When the desired level of water is reached, push out remaining air. There should be ""some"" air in the water pocket but not too much.Hope this helps."
2,Sprung a leak,So sad to say our 6 month old daughter had a wonderful time playing with it for one day. She's petite and although her 5 year old brother enjoyed showing her how to push down by day 2 it had sprung a leak. I don't believe my son did anything to make that happen. But certainly we were disappointed to throw it out before it had been in our home 48 hours.
1,"Keep Looking, great idea but not his product","Was not worth the money! Product leaked on carpet, when filled with water all the fish seemed to gather in the top air pocket not spread out like the picture shows even after reducing water volume."
3,"It's a good idea, but it stays really cold","My son is interested by the fish, but cannot stay on this for very long because the mat stays quite cold. When I take him off of the mat his skin is very cold, so I never leave him on for more than a few minutes."
2,Baby toy,I got this for grandbaby. It was very smelly. After baby played with it she smelled like plastic. Very heavy and hard to store
3,Pros & Cons,"My 3 month old son HATES tummy time so I had read reviews that this is a great device to get them interested in laying on their tummy since they have fish/water creatures to watch and push around.Pro: He is entertained and thus is able to spend more time on his tummy than he did before.Con: The water gets COLD after sitting in it for more than a day. I put warm water in, but after sitting for a few days it hit room temperature and feels cold on his face with the plastic covering. When I pick him up from playing with the mat his cheeks are always cold :(A recommendation I would have is to definitely wash the product THOROUGHLY before placing your child on it (as with any baby products). My son loves the water so much he thinks he can eat it so he is constantly putting his mouth on the plastic covering."
3,"It's alright, hard to fill",My husband had a hard time filling this with water. You really have to squeeze the whole and even then it takes a while. Our daughter is 12 months but hates belly time so I thought we would try this. It is a good idea but does not keep her interest.
3,So-so,"It is quite small, but provides an interesting texture. My little guy is too small yet (3 mos) to really play with moving the objects inside around. He does hold his head up and move his arms around on it a little. It is similar to a waterbed."
2,horrible EP mode quality,"I was extremely dissapointed with the picture quality of this tape. It is recorded in EP mode. A 36 minute presentation recorded in EP mode!! Just so they could squeeze it in a 20 minute VHS tape instead of a 40 minute one, saving the manufacturer maybe 30 cents.What a rip-off."
1,Was not for me,"This product may be great for some. It makes the camera much heavier, bulkier, and I could not figure out how it attaches. The heaviness reminded me of my SLR film camera with a 28-200 lens. I bought digital to escape that. But it may be just what you are looking for. I have the Nikon 8400 too so that has a 24mm wide angle built-in."
4,works as expected,"Used this to secure the runner for our outdoor wedding ceremony. Stuck to brick perfectly, with no slippage or issues. Easy to apply... no complaints"
3,Great Advertised Features but didn't totally deliver,"Researched all grinders in market and specifically chose the Milwaukee for reputation and variable speed feature. Can also double as a sander. Received unit that had a very audible raspy-knocking sound especially at low speeds. Spent > 1 hr on phone with Milwaukee tech support who confirmed abnormality.Got new unit in one day from Amazon but replacement unit still makes same sound but not as frequent. Went beyond 30 days so have to send unit to Milwaukee for examination and possibly new unit - total hassle!Unit is very powerful and variable speed is great. Hopefully Milwaukee won't let me down with a third unit.4/2/07 Update: Got 2nd unit back from Milwaukee in damaged box and simple check slip that it was alright - no new plastic case or written letter back stating what and how unit had been checked out. Very disappointing so am stuck with raspy, knocking grinder from what I thought was the last ""real"" genuine tool company - very disappointing."
5,One of the Finest Dessert Cookbooks Available,"The recipes in this cookbook include the standard techniques and repertoire that a good pastry chef (including a good home pastry chef) should have. Very few of these recipes are not greatly rewarding. Though some may require the devotion of a few hours, or even more, the recipes are almost always fairly easy. The chef-writers allow much flexibility in mixing parts of recipes (the outside and the inside, crust and fillings) and include the fundamentals for the basic dessert types, including cake, cheesecake, ice cream, cookies (including biscotti), pies, tarts, muffins, and fruit-based desserts. The recipes are clear, easy to follow, and require rudimentary cooking skills to produce quite amazing results. This book is appropriate for homey, feel-good deserts as well as rather bombastic ones, and each is as delicious as the next."
1,"poor descriptions, too complicated for at home","The directions are confusing and vague. Every time I made something out of this book, it didn't come out like the recipie said it should of. (And I consider myself a damn good baker!!) I would not recomend for anyone to purchase this book."
4,Burning Has Intelligence to Burn,"Nick Hoffman's latest battle with the powers that be in the English Department at the State University of Michigan owes more than a little to the traditional English mystery. Written with intelligence, deliberate and calculated conflicts, subtle suspense, dry humor make this a thinking reader's armchair adventure. Well done."
1,Didn't measure up,"I was left unfulfilled after finishing this book; even worse because I forced myself because I'd spent my good money. I believe that I have a sense of humor and a sense of satire but the book's attempts on those levels fell short by my analysis. I've never read anything else by this author, so I won't make any further generalizations about his talents other to say that I wish him better success the next time."
3,Not the strongest entry in this series,"I was disappointed with this book. I have read and loved the Nick and Stefan books, from ""Let's Get Crimnial"" forward.This is, in my opinion not nearly as good as ""Little Miss Evil.""Nick's infatuation with Juno Dromgoole is tedious.The satire of university life, while sadly accurate, is beginning to wear thin.As usual, though, the writing is beautiful.However, the plot is a bit weak, and the ending is vastly unsatisfying. Lev Raphael is a very, very good writer. If you have not read his collection of short stories, ""Dancing on Tisha B'Av,"" do so, it is a treat. Also, his novel ""Winter Eyes,"" is well worth reading. ""Winter Eyes"" is Stefan's back story, and is poweful and memorable in ways that ""Burning Down The House"" is not.Of course, one possible reason for this book is that Raphael may be taking Nick and Stefan in an unexpected direction with the next book, and he just needed to answer some questions, and ask others."
1,"NO ONE'S PERFECT, BUT...","SOMEWHERE, THIS AUTHOR ACCEPTED THE ADVICE THAT IN ORDER FOR A PROTAGONIST TO BE ROUNDED HE/SHE MUST HAVE FLAWS. HOWEVER, THE AUTHOR HAS NOT FOLLOWED THE ADVICE WISELY. FLAWS SHOULD BE RELATED TO THE PLOT AND IDEALLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PROTAGONIST TO ACHIEVE HIS GOALS. OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE BOOKS, THE NICK HOFFMAN SERIES HAS GONE FROM MYSTERIES TO WANDERINGS. POOR NICK IS FLAWED IN THE WRONG WAYS. HE SEEMS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE WHY HIS TENURE IS FOREVER DANGLING ON A STRING. HE'S AMBIGUOUS ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY. HE SPENDS HIS TIME NOW (I CITE THE LAST TWO BOOKS)INVOLVED IN ""CAPERS"" THAT ARE MARSHMELLOWS IN TERMS OF DANGER. NICK AND THE SERIES ARE FLAWED, ALRIGHT, BUT WITHOUT PURPOSE. THE AUTHOR SHOULD GIVE SERIOUS THOUGHT TO A MAKEOVER, OR ELSE END THE SERIES."
1,Of a feather?,"I read Little Miss Evil and dismissed it as a failed experiment by the author. I assumed that he would realized his failure and scurry back to the true elements that make a mystery. Unfortunately, with Burning Down the House, that's not the case. Is Lev Raphael trying to invent a new category? If so, he should stop promoting such works as mysteries. We know what to call something that quacks,waddles,and swims, but what Raphael is offering is something else. Maybe a dodo bird, and they are extinct."
1,Robbed,"I wanted to be more generous in my evaluation but the simple truth is that I hated this book. I read the first Nick Hoffman mystery and figured that Burning Down the House was another mystery. I read a lot of books about gay sluthes and consider myself knowledgeable in this sub-genre. Therefore, I'll give the author some advice. First, give Nick something sinister to solve. I could not get involved with the plot when the main threat seemed to be prank calls to an Amazon of a woman who was more man than Nick. Second, stop with the silly product endorsements. Throughout the book, there were repeated references to a particular brand of wine, etc., when it had nothing to do with the plot. Last, cut Nick's ambiguity about which side of the fence he resides sexually. He's a gay slueth, so let him be a gay slueth. Hopefully, the author will serve up something more worthy next time."
1,It hurts to say it,"I first became aware of Lev Raphael when he was an essayist, writing about his agonies over being a gay Jew. It pains me to say that he has not made a successful transition to novelist. The themes of his essays (e.g. sexual ambiguities and jealous (?) bashing of women) are not only carried over in Burning Down the House, but explored in the same preaching style. I understand that every novelist injects certain biographical elements, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of weaving a good tale. Raphael should take up his causes in essays and spare us the polemics in his novels. Burning Down the House had no substance as a novel. The plot was without suspense because there was nothing at risk (my motto: show me the corpse). And if Raphael thought that this void could be filled by the reader's fretting over whether Nick Hoffman would ""convert"" and bed down with a tough-as-nails female, he miscalulated in my regard."
1,disapointing,"I enjoyed all the other Nick and Stefan but this was big let down and a waist of money. The two things that bugged me the most was going on about Juno, by the end of the book I was ready to stuff her leopard print down her throat the second thing is knocking Christmas, if you don't like it don't centre your story around this holiday THe only reason this book got finished is because I'd paid to much to dump it. Where ever he is planning to go with the next book it will be with out me not waisting anymore time or money on them"
2,Poor effort,"There was no payoff with this book. The storyline was slow but I kept reading hoping that the end would justify my time. The ending was a fizzle. I know the author is capable of better because I read Death of a Constant Lover. You were off your game this time Mr. Raphael, but I'm willing to give you another try."
5,Virginia singer goes national,"Music lovers in Virginia have had the great good fortune of having Rene Marie residing Roanoke and Richmond over the past few years. We have watched her develop her jazz vocal skills in concerts, clubs and even a theater musical. This is her second album distrbuted nationally and its just great! She has the ability to give a unique interpretation of everything from jazz classics to pop to folk music. Her rendering of the medley of Dixie and Strange Fruit is worth the price of the album alone. If you are considering the purchase of this CD check out that cut or Them There Eyes. I understand Rene Marie has moved from Virginia to a bigger market. We will sorely miss her....."
5,Rene Marie featuring Chris Potter,"The careers of two jazz greats collided when Chris Potter came on-board to do the sax work for this release. Rene Marie is always challenging, honest, agile, original and enticing. ""Blackbird"" is an adptation of the Beatles' hit but absolutely rendered into something new and hot and real with this amazing voice. Check out how genius CP stays out of her way and lets her soar. No wonder Herbie Hancock hires Potter whenever he's available, as do McCoy Tyner (they're now doing a world-tour reprising the great Trane/Hartman collaboration), Kenny Werner and countless others. While Potter only weighs in on about half the tracks, the flavor is still just right. Two great heavenly bodies collide here--and the result is beautiful."
1,Pathetic,"Not funny. How does this dude get booked? In my humble opinion, a total waste of time. Sorry, but this guy is a loser."
1,Nihilistic,"Irreverent for sure, and frankly more than a little self serious. I didn't really find him all that funny and the claim that he doesn't rely on shock value isn't true at all. Just see his ""frequent abortion card"" on his show Tosh.o.If you don't find fake joviality funny, you probably won't like Daniel Tosh."
2,Really?,He is funny he doesn't need to curse so much...and talking about God and blaspheming just doesn't cut it for me! Jesus is real people it's a shame most of you are going to clik that this wasn't helpful but it's ok I am actually defending my GOD!
1,"DISREPECTFUL, NOT FUNNY, RACIST....","I love him on his TV show on Comedy Central, but his brand of stand up comedy is not funny at all. I get comedy and how you poke fun at people or groups, but his presentation style reflects racisms and lack of respect. I got about 30 min into it to give it a chance before I said F it."
1,"No class, no taste, not my cup of tea","If you enjoy listening to a**holes, this is the comedian for you. He is vulgar, irreverent, and ridicules lower class, women, and I don't know who else because I couldn't stand to listen to this waste of oxygen for more than 5 minutes. I prefer comedians who can tell a story and make it funny, not rely on the shock value of crudity. People get de-sensitized to crudity and it's not funny any more, but a good story can always be funny."
1,Only in OC,"Everyone in the audience was white, under 30 and skinny. If you are not one or all three of these things, it is very doubtful that you will enjoy this. I tried to laugh, but I found myself wandering away from the TV. He even refers to the fact that the laughter dies down the longer his jokes run. His initial jokes are humorous at best, but have been done. He then elaborates on them and makes you want to punch him in the end. I am happy that I was able to view this for free. I would never want to spend money on it!"
1,Region Locked Purchase.,"I recently bought this DVD and some others from Amazon, i would like to note that i really enjoy Daniel Tosh's comedy, but this is hard to watch when everything you have sent me is region locked to the USA and it clearly states on my postal address that i live in Australia. So i cannot watch any of the products i have bought from Amazon, it was a waste of money and a total waste of time. Idiots."
4,Daniel Tosh is hilarious!,"I purchased this Dvd 2 months ago for my Husband for his birthday. I've only seen this on Comedy Central, I havent watched the dvd yet, but I think Daniel Tosh is great!"
1,LAME,"Who in their right mind would think this pathetic excuse for a ""comic"" is either funny or entertaining? Lame, lame, lame...""humor"" for the lowest common denominator of our culture and on the level of repeatedly watching someone light their own farts. Tosh is pathetic and talentless."
1,Unpleasant!,Everything this guy said was either offensive or negative! I didn't laugh once! He is just a big jerk! And the only reason the crowd laughed is because they are from the OC. AKA: insensitive to other people's plight. Not worth your time!
1,If you cannot hear the obvious laugh track added to this performance then you should get your ears checked....,"This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen and the blatant laugh track that is forced over this unfunny comic. Daniel has a decent show on CC, but this stand up bit is as funny as a car full of clowns, ass clowns which is about what his routine is.It feels over produced for the 2 bit show that it is and it's not worth the MSRP - Manufacturer's Suggested RAPE Price of $10."
1,only for americans,"I'm a big fan of stand-ups. After some unlucky strikes I now always make some research before purchasing addition to my collection.It seems to me that this one contains too much US-specific material to actually make it ""universally"" enjoyable. I really don't know what is the difference between people in Nebraska and Dakota. Therefore - no go."
1,WOW!!!! PARENTS BEWARE,"I HAVE WATCH THIS PROGRAM DEMAND. I DID NOT THINK IT WAS TO BAD, NOT GOOD, BUT NOT THAT BAD. BUT WHEN I BOUGHT THE VIDEO, I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW DISRESPECTFUL HE WAS TOWARDS RELIGION. I DID NOT SEE THIS ON HIS TV PROGRAMS. BUT HIS STAND UP COMEDY IN ANOTHER SUBJECT ALTOGHER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE NO LONGER WATCH THIS PROGRAM AT ALL. THE VIDEO WAS THOWN OUT."
3,I don't get all the love/hate,"Judging by the shape of the review curve, Tosh is supposed to be one of those love him or hate him sort of comedians. If you like Tosh.0, you'll probably like the special. I prefer him on his show, though, where the videos back up his comedy and give him something to talk about; with that said, I can think of much worse ways to waste an hour. Don't go in expecting anything profound, and you should enjoy your time."
4,Ummmm....,"If I wasn't so busy trying to determine the swing in his 'metro', then I might have laughed....imstead I was busy playing detective."
3,10% is pretty funny,"Very funny,.....sometimes, ish.Not really. No idea how he became famous. Must have some connections in hollywood. He should try parody himself, that could me a new ganre."
2,blah,"im a guy who loves to laugh, but this one failed to make me laugh and for some reason it made me think of myself that im silly."
2,"same material, watch on comedy central before buying...","i would love to give this a better review, and honestly if you haven't heard daniel tosh at all then by all means check out this DVD. but i was very disappointed that this standup is roughly 85% recycled material from his previous standup CD/DVD 'true stories i made up.' daniel tosh is a very funny comedian and has great potential, but i think this DVD is going to really upset a lot of people expecting something new, it really is word for word a lot of the same exact jokes with a only a few new bits too far inbetween. if you get a chance, try and catch this on comedy centrail as it'll be playing a lot over the next couple weeks - but if you really want to see or hear this guy, get his first release."
2,Not Pleasantly Surprised.,Josh Daniel - I was disappointed. Maybe it's just not my generation ofcomedy. I did try but found it to be not funny.
1,People actually laugh at this crap?!?,"This guy is just sad... after waiting for 5 minutes of his attempts to make a joke that would actually be funny, I'm done with this show... this attitude of ""elevating myself by putting other people down"" is so old, c'mon people how can you listen to that..."
3,Eh.,I didn't think he was all that hilarious. Some of his jokes were okay for a chuckle but overall I was not terribly impressed.
2,meh,His show is reasonably funny but this didn't really do it for me. Had a few funny jokes but a LOT of bombs.
5,Great one hour comedy,"I really enjoyed watching this on Comedy Central, so I decided to buy it. Its pretty much the same but uncensored with some extras thrown in.I personally found this 1 hour stand up much funnier and enjoyable than his more recent Happy Thoughts.The extras include Daniel post-show asking people what they liked and disliked and some deleted scenes. It provides a few extra laughs and some insight into Daniel's personality, but nothing truly must-see.The packaging is like a typical dvd but maybe a bit cheaper. The case is pretty thin and flimsy with parts of it cut out to save plastic (from the outside it looks normal)."
5,Hilarious,I live in NY and go to comedy clubs constantly and haven't found someone that surprised me pleasantly like Tosh in a while. I think that he is easily the funniest new comedian on the scene today and I just hope that I see more of him.
1,"Not worth it, even free",Amazon requires at least one star to get the review printed. I think this video is not worth the time or loss of dignity you may feel if you watch. My first review was not allowed so I had to tone it down. I am disappointed in humanity.
3,They hadn't gotten the Barney formula down yet,"This is one of the very early Barney videos with the original Backyard gang, Michael, Amy, Tina, Lucy, etc.They introduce Derrick in this episode, who has just moved into the neighborhood and doesn't know if Santa has his address. So Barney takes the kids up to the north pole, where they meet Mrs. Clause and confirm that Derrick is on the list.Overall the songs are OK, but if you are used to the current Barney, you will find a few things jarring. For example, Barney's eyes are wide open, rather than sleepy half shut as they are now. This gives him a somewhat manic and (IMO) scary look - Note - my 3 year old son does not find him scary, in fact he loves this video. Oh well. Barney is a slightly different shade of purple, and in one song the kids do a ""disco-y"" hip thrust that rather surprised us."
4,The Backyard Gang will live on in our hearts,"Three Wishes is one of the Barney and the Backyard Gang series of the '80s and early '90s. It features Michael, Amy, Tina, Luci, Jason, and Adam. The songs were catchy and fun, especially Mr. Knickerbocker (only in this series would you see Barney breakdance). While it's not THE best BG show, it certainly beats the drivel we're stuck with nowadays. I'd suggest this for children whose parents grew up watching the BG. It's fun, and it doesn't ""talk down"" to children, as do the new episodes of Barney and Friends.I also include Barney's Campfire Singalong and A Day at the Beach as my top recommendations for the BG series."
3,Scared Me!,"The only thing I remember is barney getting stuck in the fireplace at the begining. I don't know if there was a fire or not. It scared me. His deeper voice and deeper shade of purple that was different from the new barney is the reason why I was scared. Maybe your kids might like watching it, I don't know, but if it's for kids than thats good enough for me."
3,"my 3 year old loves it, but it's an early Barney","I purchased this for my 3 year old a year ago and sat down to watch it with her. I was disappointed when I realized it was a very old version of Barney, obviously one of his first videos. Barney is not as soft and cuddly looking as his outfit needed some fine tuning. Still, my daughter didn't notice and she still likes to drag this video out and watch it. I am buying the new Christmas Barney and will be expecting better things!"
3,"Good, but not my favorite Barney video","This video had some nice songs, catchy tunes and seemed to be very entertaining for my little sisters. However, the story line, in my thought, was not as good as some of the other Barney videos. I would say Backyard Show, A Day At The Beach, and Rock With Barney were my sisters' favorites. I would reccomend this video if you are a Barney buff, but it was not my most favorite."
1,WHERE'S THE BARF BAG??!!,"We are big Barney fans, but this has got to be one of the worst Barney videos I've seen, probably because it's so old. The production looks so cheap and hokey, and there's only one good song (a little ""rap"" the kids do dressed as elves). And Barney's costume is quite homely (his jaw is way too skinny and angular). The newer, cuter-looking Barney is much better. The sets and overall production are greatly improved now. The only thing I miss about the ""vintage"" Barney is the original cast- Lucy and Tina were great. If you prefer the old cast, I'd recommend ""Barney Goes to School"" and the ""Campfire Singalong"" videos-- they are far better than this one (though obviously not as ""dazzling"" as the newest productions)!"
1,Messed up,It was messed up and did not work such a waste I'm sry I got it sry to say son could nit watch it

5,A must-have book,"This is a must have resource for anyone involved in background checks, labor law, security, human resources or any employer. The subject of criminal records and employment is very complex, and is controlled not only by federal law, but the laws of 50 states. This book provides a very practical and hands-on guide to legally obtaining, evaluating and using criminal records for employment purposes."
2,Good research for any Beach Boy fan,"If you are a Beach Boy fan, and enjoy listening to and reading about anything that relates to the group's surf music culture of the 60's, this box set is worth the price. The Sunrays were managed by Beach Boys father Murray Wilson after being fired by the group that he had helped get started. The Sunrays bio, which is included with the box set, is very informative on the subject of Murray Wilson, his troubles with the Beach Boys and his attempt to prove his value as the Sunray's leader. The music on the three CD set covers everything the Sunrays recorded, and I mean EVERYTHING. There is even an old demo for a Kentucky Fried Chicken ad with Murray singing lead! Great stuff for anyone who enjoys finding ""lost"" treasures from pop music's past."
4,Sun Rays and various name releases,"Sun Rays were Murray Wilson's pet project after he was fired from managing the Beach Boys. There are some really excellent tunes here, and it a a fairly excellent representative of all their releases."
2,Not about enterprise application integration,"I bought this book to learn more about enterprise application integration (I do systems integration consulting). Parts of the book were somewhat relevant, but by and large, this is an outdated Java and XML book. This book includes a primer on basic XML, and some introductory SAX and DOM examples, but at least a third of this book is useless filler like the XML spec from w3.org.Buy O'Reilly's Java and XML by Brett Mclaughlin if you want to learn about XML and Java working together - he is the author of the JDOM API, and that book is much more up to date.I'm still looking for a good Enterprise Application Integration/Middleware/data process book that explains best practices."
4,Know your Java,"Wow! As I started to read this book (yes I read computer books cover-to-cover, pretty sick) I realized I had better pull out some of my Java books as references. This book is not for the inexperienced Java programmer.Trying to read this book without a solid grasp of the language will prove difficult and possibly frustrating. I had a couple of my students look through this book after class and I could see their eyes just glaze over.So far, I have found this is a very authoritative book on XML & Java, but be warned it is not for the faint of heart."
2,Take a pass on this one,"Out of date concepts, large print, tedious line-by-line code walkthroughs and a 200 page Appendix all conspire to make this book a waste of valued cash."
3,"Not Enterprise application, all Java","I bought this book with hopes of more discussion of how XML should be structured when integrated with CICS, or another Mainframe application. It seems to be totally a treatise on how Java should be coded: There are numerous examples of Java code, and would be helpful from that angle. I may find it helpful later when the bridges to mainframe data are understood by me."
4,very innovative,"well, im no sure if thats how all would describe it, but it sure as hell is different from anything i have ever heard. I got the pleasure of seeing these guys at the knitting factory in NY, and the totally blew me away, i mean, like thrash angry yelling, screaming, music. Normally, these are qualities i hate in music, but these guys put it together so beautifully, i mean, they really make it all come together, infact sometimes i just want to here the frontman scream the whole way through a song. Um... I have heard some tracks off the cd, and it doesnt sound anything like it is live. Live is about 500zillion times better. So honestly, support the band and by the cd, but go check them out live, they are truly amazing. Oh yeah, one more thing. I noticed yahoo put this in the experimental/hiphop/i dunno what, well its not hip hop, it is experimental a bit, but it is certainely not anything like hip hop at all."
1,"Does not fit ""older"" sawzall type tools....","I gave this 1 star because I didn't get to actualy use this blade; it won't fit in my Porter Cable tool....read on for explanation.I have an older model Porter Cable ""sawzall"" type tool [model 737] with it's ""quick change"" mechanism. Over the years, I have used various Milwaukee blades in this tool. I bought a set of these blades, item #48-00-5021, but found they wouldn't fit in my Porter Cable tool. I tried 3 of the 5 blades in the package. So I called ""Milwaukee Tool..."" and asked them if there was a manufacturing change. They confirmed the newer ""AX"" and ""Torch"" blade models are indeed thicker and will NOT fit some older models of not only their sawzall. They still offer for sale blades that are slightly thinner; so if you have an older recipricating saw, you'll probably need the Milwaukee blade model ""48-00-5031"". The ""newer"" blades are .062 thick; ""older"" blades are .050 thick."
1,Be aware...be very aware.,"Looking for simple little concert video of Ambrosia? You've come to the wrong place. And how.Ambrosia made some terrific, tuneful music in their heyday...and this silly, dismissible DVD contains none of it. Instead, what you get is some uninspired footage of a couple of uninspired AM staples (which as all true Ambrosia fans know, were not representative of their most enduring work) and a comely young thing way over her head trying as hard as she knows how (and failing miserably) to produce something resembling interviews of the band. Painful.The whole thing is an embarrassment. Don't waste your money.The world waits still for a decent glimpse of this band's stage show."
2,Disappointing,"Although the music in this concert isn't bad, the original lead singer David Pack is not performing on this dvd. The price of this video wasn't cheap so i'm very disappointed. Also, its not a straight concert, there are interviews in between each song and there are only 3 oomplete songs: ""Mama"", ""How much i feel"" and ""biggest part of me""."
4,Very touching and entertaining film,"I've seen this film a couple of times and I really enjoy it. The story is great and easy to follow, as most of Danielle Steel films are. Kelly Rutherford (those who are Melrose Place buffs know that she plays Megan Lewis, Michael's ex)is so great that she really takes care of her brother and sisters when her parents died on that Titanic disaster and sacrifices her life. This story really portrays LOVE, CARING, and UNSELFISNESS towards other people's happiness. This is a must-see film for people of all ages."
5,this guy is great!,"I just saw Keller in concert and was blown away. imagine Phish crossed with Bobby Mcferrin and that gives you some idea. he is an awesome guitarist who can sing and dance (sic) too. I haven't listened to this particular album (yet), but based on 2 hours of watching him sing, mix, strum, whistle and perform I can most heartily recommend. Keller Williams is one of the most talented musicians I've come across in a long while. fin."
4,Interesting historical account of Georgia politics,"I was born in Atlanta and never had much interest in Georgia politics. Now that I reside in Colorado, I am interested in books about my childhood home. This book was a fascinating account of a very complex man, Lester Maddox. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get a sense of this gentleman and what he did for the state of Georgia. Many thanks to the author for enlightening me on Gov. Maddox."
1,Many Editorial Mistakes by a Maddox Apologist,"Mr. Short is clearly a Maddox apologist who tries to justify Maddox as a ""segregationist"" as opposed to a ""racist,"" as though there were a great difference. As a Georgia native and resident, I am embarrassed that this man was our Governor. But in a state dominated by Democrats, our legislature chose party over principles. We continue to live this legacy of Maddox with Tom Murphy, Tommy Irvin and Zell Miller dominating our politics. Throughout this book, I found many editorial mistakes in many places in this book. Mercer University Press clearly dropped the ball on this one."
1,Faulty door on this oven,"Summary: Oven door has a serious flawReview: I purchased this Frigidaire oven 1 year ago. After using it for a few months, the upper door became hard to open, and the hinge on the left side was 'warping.' The oven door was not straight when I looked directly at it. I was using the oven one day, and I was not able to open the door. I had to remove the door to take out my burned food. I called for service, and the hinge was replaced. Then, the same thing happened again. The second serviceman said that there was a recall on this oven because of the construction flaw that caused the door problem. I would suggest not purchasing this product until Frigidaire can guarantee that this has been repaired. I know a person who recently bought one, and is also currently having the same door problem that I had."
1,Serious Door Hinge Problem,"Have had this oven for three years, after the first year, had the same problem with the door hinge. Difficulty opening, hinge stuck on right side, had a repairman come out and fix it, for $250.00. Now, am heaving the same problem again, this time the right side again, now the left side is broken too. Do I call a repair man again, or replace the whole oven? Someone mentioned a recall, I can't find anything out about that."
1,Horrible oven.,Temperature is never accurate. Have had to have the hinges replaced over 3 times now. Even the service guy said this model was getting several complaints about the hinges.
4,A good practical oven for those who do not want to spend.,"I wanted to keep the gas oven feature in my wall oven, besides, I didn't want to pay an additional $500.00 ($300.00 to install an electric line, plus $250.00 for installation and cutting the cabinet, etc.) plus my space was tight, I have an older kitchen which I did not want to spend thousands renovating. Frigidaire has a good name in appliances and so far my oven has been working fine. I have already broiled and baked in it, with good results. My one complaint has been that the oven light switch has already broken, which is a disappointment, but my warranty will cover it and it will be fixed this week. But all in all, if you have limited space and do not want to spend thousands (like for the DeLonghi), this is a more than adequate oven."
1,Oven Hinge,"Bought this oven 3+ years ago. The hinge broke. It was still under warranty so the oven was replaced. Repairman said it could not be fixed. Now 3 1/2 years later, the hinge broke again. Now it's not under warranty and the repairman says the oven needs to be replaced. DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN!"
1,defective oven,"We bought a Frigidaire wall oven (FGB24T3EBD) in 2008. Within the first year, the upper oven door started to stick when the oven was hot. The problem worsened, until we were unable to open the door at all (while it was hot, with a cake baking inside) without forcing it open. The hinges are flimsily attached with sheet metal screws that easily pull out, deforming the sheet metal. The hinges are not repairable, and unfortunately it is out of warranty now, so we're screwed."
3,New Model Fixed Hinge Problem,"I too have had alot of trouble with the door and the hinges. After being persistent with customer service, Frigidaire replace the entire oven for free. The new model has better hinge design. For those of you with this problem, get a repairman to write a report that the oven is not serviceable...maybe $45. Then go up the customer service phone chain until you get satisfaction. Good luck."
1,"Piece of Trash, Hinges Always Break","Like all of the others, I have had an absolutely terrible time with this oven. The hinges continue to break. They will keep breaking, and I will keep calling Lowe's. DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN!It was the only oven that fit in our slot, but now I will look for an alternative to this flimsy piece of trash."
5,You Don't Have to Be Texan to Love This Book,"I read this book when it came out in 1994, and again this year, 2011. Loved it both times. I returned to the book because I remembered that I had slowed down my reading because I didn't want to leave the characters. They were that real to me and I cared about them all. I also had taken a trip to the Presidio la Bahia and was so moved by the haunted feel of the place. I wanted to read again about what happened there.This is a must-read book for every Texan. But you don't have to be Texan to love this book. It's more than a history story. The characters' struggles, fears, joys, and loves are universal. Buy this book! (Or get it at your local library.)"
2,A comedy of errors,"After I had bought this book and set about seriously reading it, I discovered too many errors. At first I thought I had not remembered my high school German, but after checking dictionaries I realized this guide book was very flawed with incorrect translations. It reminded me of the Monty Python sketch with the Hungarian tourist and his Hungarian-English phrasebook: ""Oh my nipples explode...."" When I went on my European vacation I didn't take this guide along."
2,"Great content, too many typos","If you learned German in high school or college and know the vocab and grammar but don't know how to find a cigarette or a club (without sounding stupid), go ahead and buy this book. It will provide phrases that you never learned in high school but will be invaluable while you're traveling around German-speaking countries, especially if you're young and hip. If you don't already know German, buy something with fewer typos. There must be a typo on every 4th or 5th page in this book. (Although I haven't actually counted.)Two notable phrases from this book:""Where can I find lesbian club?""""I'm still a groupie after all these years."""
3,Great for casual speakers,"The study of the German language is a personal hobby of mine, though I have never received any formal education on the subject. For any casual speaker of Deutsch, like myself, this phrasebook should prove to be invaluable. While it does contain numerous errors, the sheer volume of material covered easily offsets the book's grammatical oversights. For the price, it provides what I consider to be an impressive level of immersion, especially for those of us who have never had the chance to visit Germany or Austria."
5,Where this candle,"I'm so sad I can't find this candle its one of the only smells I like, I LOVE! most candles are yucky, THIS is amazing and my husband and dad love it too (not super girly or floral smelling). Best Candle ever! Please, please, please, make sure that they will continue to be in stock! I've been looking everywhere! Use to get it at target, they don't have it anymore though."
5,Where can I get more?!?!?!,This candle is by far my favorite. I haven't looked for one in a long time and now Target doesn't have them any more and they're not available here either. Help! I need more.....
5,Tiger Tiger at their best!,"I've been following Tiger Tiger for many years. The first cassette tape I had of their was taped in their garage! I loved it, and played it over and over until I wore it out! My favorite song on this CD is ""Landlord"" it is wonderful! If you enjoy rock music, and are sensitive to American Indian issues, this is group to listen to! The other CD's I have, Space Age Indian and Tamiami Station are wonderful also!"
5,It Is the Dream Come Alive!,Once you realize they've attended film school and overlook some initial pretentions I believe you'll simply tumble into the dream with awe and delight. Extraordinary. Few film makers could realize this mood and enchantment. Plus... alittle scary!
3,"""QUAY-SEE, Indeed!""","I know, bit of a stretch for a title, but this one's another odd fish! Now what else would you expect? The prologue, spoken by the stunning Alice Krige [she makes far too few appearances] is in Afrikaans if anyone wondered.....not Dutch or German.It's a slow mood-piece about a servant school; [our hero Jacob, Mark Rylance] is the new student - also the focus of Brother and Sister Johann and Lisa Benjamenta. There are 'very odd moments' between brother, sister and student, including a rather peculiar scene between Johan and Jacob.......no QUITE sure what that is about. The work resonates David Lynch, yet the Brothers Quay do have their own little world. [Then again for some strange reason Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder's ""Young Frankenstein"" - the Frau Blucher moments......]This one's a long process - intentionally repetitive.A little liquid refreshment [spiritual] might add to this journey.Companion pieces? ""Eraserhead"" and ""Begotten"""
2,Not nearly what I was hoping for,I just rented this and watched it last night. Frankly I couldn't find much of a coherent plot. Some of the images were cool and some of the lines were interesting but I couldn't feel anything for any of the characters. Each character was too strange and too distant to relate to on any level. Perhaps that was the feeling the Brothers Quay was shooting for. I was hoping for a challenging commentary on domestic service at the end of the 19th century with neat animation as the movie write-up suggested: didn't get it.
3,If only the actors would shut up,"""Institute Benjamenta"" has all the positive attributes one would expect from the Brothers Quay: poetic and haunting scenic composition, magnificent photography with ultra-shallow depth of field (a Quay hallmark), and an eerie off-key musical score perfectly mated to the visuals.What the film lacks -- and lacks quite desperately -- is effective writing. The Brothers' verbal skills are, unfortunately, several orders of magnitude below their compelling visual imagination. The result is that scene after scene is damaged by lines of dialogue that range from pedestrian to downright painful.While ""The Brothers Quay Collection"" DVD of (dialogue-free!) short films remains an enthusiastic five-star recommendation, ""Institute Benjamenta"" is much more hit-or-miss. Fans of the Quays will at least want to take a look; others may be better off skipping this one."
4,Place That Fork,"Strangely haunting. If you are mesmerized by Butoh dance, then this movie should appeal--not for fidgeties predisposed to jazz dance.I haven't seen this feature since it came out in 1996, yet I still have vivid imagery recurrences of the cinematography. Imagine linking a million painstakenly taken sequences of still photographs, printed in sepia-tone, and you'll get an idea what this movie is like to watch. How you view this movie will depend on your state of mind and you're patience for artistic self-absorbtion. Soon I will track it down and reabsorb."
4,Good good.,Everything went smoothly with my transaction. The textbook is informative and easy to navigate through.
3,Beautiful bible,"The bible was perfect, but I am an older person and the print was too small for me to read comfortably."
1,Study What?,"The ""Word"" in text form is found in all published Bibles. The concept of a Study Bible is that, through the inclusion of notes, an individual's questions might be answered. The number of footnotes are extremely limited in this Study Bible and worse yet, of the many questions I contemplated, I found a footnote addressed to that particular verse on only one occasion! In baseball, 3 strikes and you are out. The footnotes of the NRSV Harper Study Bible are a major league strike-out fest!"
5,I love Mafalda!,"A wonderful movie I was waiting to watch for years! Eventhough Quino is from Argentina and that's just at the other side of the mountains I was never able to find good deals for books, or the video it self here. Just lovely!"
5,A long wait but well worth it,"Infamy easily is the best cd i have herd all year, they are one of the few groups that havn't changed their style, all these other groups that used to have that grimy NY sound have turned into radio play groups. Almost every song on this cd is a 5 star song, songs like ""nothing like home"", ""get away"", ""get at me"", are some of the best songs on the cd. Mobb deep is the greatest rap duo of all time, Prodigy the most prolific rhyme spitter, and havoc one of the best producers are unstoppable and they will continue to make new bangers untill they dropp."
3,Infamy Was Disgrace,I Love Mobb Deep But This Cd Made Me Kind of Mad I Say If you Want It Maybe Get It Another Way Then Paying more than 10.00 For ItMy Favorite Songs On Cd1.Nothing Like Home2.Burn3.# 10 I Forgot The Name Of It
3,the infamous back in the house once again,"Mobb deeo seems to have changed a lot during the infamous and hell on Earth days. While listening to this cd it kind of reminded me of all the other rap out their today, some good examples are tracks 7 and 8. The beats were also lacking the usual griminess, they still hard there hardcore side on some tracks though like tracks 2,4,5,6,10,. Overall it was a good album even though it was different."
4,"Not their best, but still hot","I guess Mobb Deep spoiled the hip hop world with their three previous albums. This one gets close, but Prodigy doesn't come with the same intensity he has before. But he is still a great emcee and Havoc is one of the best producers around."
5,the textbook for thugs,i think this is a great cd to listen and ride to. it has great beats and serious flow! i love prodigy and havoc. buy this cd if you love non commercial rap! every last song is great!
2,Queensbridge is falling down.,"True this album has some 2 or 3 hot joints, but the majority of this is that watered down electronic style that we had to deal with since Murda Muzik. Mobb Deep has kissed the concrete beats and the intricate ""reality rap"" style that they had mastered goodbye. Now they kick basic ""thug rap"" and use experimental electronic (synthy) beats. ""Get Away"" and ""Burn"" are my favorite joints on here. But make no mistake, the Infamous/Hell On Earth Mobb Deep will never be back.Plus the old Prodigy is dead, so we have to listen to his new super simple (and super slow) rhyme style once again. After taking a heavy beating from both Jay-Z and Nas, be prepared to throw a rose on their career's casket."
3,A few standout songs,"Infamy is Mobb Deep's latest and is far from their best album. Time alone will tell if they'll ever make another ""The Infamous"". There are a few standout tracks that are worth hearing on the album though, especially ""Get Away"", ""The Learning (Burn)"" ""Nothing Like Home"", etc. But overall it is nothing special. Mobb Deep did not break any new ground with this album and it is weak compared to their previous work. I thought it could never happen, but The Mobb is finally slippin. Oh well, we'll have to see what the new Cormega will be like..."
1,infamy,"hmmm, another wac album by mobb deep out of all five of their albums only 2 are okay infamy this album is filled with weak lyrics and poor production havoc should not be rapping or producing even the name is corny however their is one song on the album that is okay( get at me )it seems like every rapper in the world is getting more and more commercial and leaving true rap fans very dissapointed this album should be avoided or if you bought it and didnt like it throw it in the garbage with the rest of the junk"
2,Jay-z got the best of them,"I loved the infamous,and hell on earth,but unlike nas,mobb deep doesn't come back strong at Jay-z,and this might be the end of them,people are going against them,like nas and ja-z one time friends,that must hurt,plus doing a song with 112,i kinda feel bad for them,this isn't for mobb deep fans from back in 95,peace"
3,"Not bad, fans'll love it","3,5 starz. Mobb dropped straigt murda muzic style album but Infamy is better than tha last albums. Havoc's blazin, P rappin like he did it on H.N.I.C.( too laid back, i dont love such type of sh1t) Anyway it b da Straight QB sh1t. My be i'll love it more if i'll listen 2 it ones again. Best tracks are ""Pray for me"", ""Clap"" and "" Bchez on my back""."
1,Mobb Deep [is bad],"Mobb Deep is the worst rap group out right now.This is the worst cd I have ever heard.I used to be a Mobb Deep fan until I heard this cd.There is only one good song on this whole cd and it's the video they made,""Get Away"".Nobody should buy this cd,you should not even waste a blank cd burning it.I would buy a Britney Spears cd before I buy a Mobb Deep cd again."
2,hot garbage,"FIRST OF ALL THESE KATS GET CARRIED NUMEROUS OF TIMES, THEN THEYRESPONSES ARE WACK, BEATS ARE LAIM,#1 OF THEM ALL, BROWNOSING WITH 112 ON VIDEOS THAT MY FRIENDS IS OUT 4 REAL."
2,Prodigys Finished.,"This is definately the Mobb's worst CD, and probably the worst CD I've heard this year. I think Havoc came through on the beats (though not as tight as the old days) and murders Prodigy lyrically. Havoc should think more of himself lyrically because Prodigy has totally lost it. I'm an MC and after listening to the first 3 tracks I could tell he was finished. I could write better lyrics than that the the first month I started rappin, and you can't even hear him. I'm gettin so tired of artists being on one extreme or another. Either their only talkin about the ice and crap, or like Prodigy every verse is talkin about the different ways he's gonna kill you. This CD is horrible- Save your money for the new Nas. PEACE"
3,good beats,"solid effort. havoc does a good job on the production along with alchemist, and scott stortch. havoc is more interesting to listen to on this record than his partner prodigy. his (havoc) rhymes aren't great but he sounds hungry and more involved if that makes sense at all. love tracks 2 and 9. 12's got this great theatrical feel to it. i think a lot of rap records would benefit from fewer tracks. this one has 17 total. 3 of 'em are easily throw away tracks to me. it's as if rap artist try to give listeners their money's worth by stacking the amount of songs on a record, but, i think if they could condense the whole effort and sort of use it to demonstrate a point of veiw and or to capture a point in time where they felt a certain way or thought a certain way and chose songs based on that it would all make for a better listen."
5,this album is greatness,"yo man, i dint like mobb deep cuz of that whole 2 pac war, cuz u know pac is tha man, but anyways i bought the c.d. cuz of the song with 112, comon man if u a playa u gotta have that song for tha ladies u naw mean?? but anyways the whole c.d. turned out to be great, i dont know about that mr. biggs song though, that fu's voice makes me sleepy. but besides that this whole c.d. was nothing less than great, i like ""get at me"" that song is dedicated to my enemies man."
3,3.5 Stars for Mobb Deep this time around...,"Mobb Deep will always get love for dropping ""The Infamous"" back in 1995. This was a classic disc. The group then released ""Hell on Earth"" and the serioud ""Murda Musiz"". Prodigy also unleashed the H.N.I.C. album receiving love from city to city. In comes ""Infamy"" where Mobb Deep seemed to lose the usual focus that they have..Prodigy was too busy throwing shots at Jay-Z (Takeover..diss track at Nas and Prodigy)b/c of the Blueprint. His lyrics were not as sharp and he left Havoc to fend for the group. Don't get me wrong...Havoc and Big Noyd held the Mobb down. There are some hot songs on this CD and it's not a weak album by no means......they just could have done better..."
3,The Infamous Mobb Deep is back!,"There will never be a Mobb Deep album like The Infamous... This album is definitely better than Hell on Earth and Juvenile Hell, but it is still somewhat below Murda Muzick. The production can get boring at times and I dont like Mobb Deep over Scott Storch's beats. Havoc still makes the grimiest beats, and Prodigy doesn't disappoint with the hard lyrics, but sometimes they get boring. Check out the hooks to ""Kill that N*gg*"", or ""Handcuffs"". Not much imagination nor creativity there. There are a few gems though, especially ""Get Away"". This is not the best Mobb Deep album, but if you're a die-hard fan, you'll like it."
2,mobb deep has fallen off,"Mobb deep honestly has never been the same since the bangin' classics ""The infamous"" and ""Hell on Earth"" albums and probably never will. What has happened to their flawless dark beats and lyrics? I bought ""Infamy"" hoping they returned to this perfect formula after the mediocre ""Murda Muzik"". I found that on ""infamy"" P's lyrics are slow and sound different. Hav's lyrics are the only part of Mobb Deep that haven't fallen off"
3,not mobb deep,"this is when MD first went mainstream and poppy. this isnt the real mobb deep and same goes for Amerikaz Nightmare. The Infamous, Hell On Earth, and Murda Muzik are there only ones that were really good. and were real. SOG 4 LIFE!!"
2,Weak,"Mobb Deep is getting trasher and trasher. Simpler and Simpler. The reality rap pioneers are gone, the common thug rappers are here. The Concrete beats are gone, soft non sinister sounding electronic beats are here. Both Jay-Z and Nas gave this group a beating their career wont recover from -- unless they bring back some of that old energy and insightfulness."
2,very disappointing,"Before I even took the time to listen to this album, I was already afraid what to expect, after hearing Prodigy's H.N.I.C.I have been a Mobb-fan for a long time and copped every album exept P's solo album.I'm very disappointed of the fact that the old Mobb Deep have traded their grimy style for the ""new-wave"" hiphop that has been going on for a while now. Havoc beats lack the dark, underground touch that made these guys (in)famous; he has clearly chosen for the new electronic sound. I think it's a pity, but everybody should check it out for theirselves and see what's up.PeaceK.Lion"
2,not a mobb like album,"The only reason it gets a 2 is because of Havoc. Besides maybe 4 songs, ""P"" aint do sh!t. This is the worst mobb album I have heard and I got all of them except the one they made when they was like 15 or 16. P talked too much about Jay-Z until it got old, but Havoc held it down. H.N.I.C. must have took all the rhymes out of ""P"", Looking for a better performance next time."
3,Infamy Or Not?,"Mobb Deep seriously suprised me that they could do so much less tan they did on previous albums. The only tracks I really approve of on ""Infamy"", are the radio freindly hits ""Hey Luv ( Anything )"" and ""The Learning ( Burn )"".I'm sorry i can't provide you with an intreging, full of details, review about this album, but Mobb Deep made it to where i can't. I am very disappointed with ""Infamy"".NOTE: Even though i find this cd very disappointing, i found that i can't stop listening to ""Hey Luv"" and ""Learning (Burn)"". So i have to give it some recommandation."
5,Making A Rainbow,"This is a great episode of Mister Rogers, because it shows him trying to do an ""experiment"" and failing at it. Mister Rogers actually gets visibly frustrated while trying to make a rainbow appear and thus the show is a fantastic springboard for talking about when things don't go according to plan. In ""make believe"" a character encounters his own frustration when he is unable, at first, to make a rainbow appear in the sky. In the end everyone is able to make a rainbow and to top it off there is a great factory video of a gold mine."
4,Georgeous Color but Small,"I just received my Ringlets of Romance King Quilt Set. It has georgeous color. It is thin, but since I typically have multiple quilts on my bed, that was not a problem for me. I was disappointed, however, at the size. I ordered a King, which does not fit my King-sized bed at all. It does fit my Queen-sized beds perfectly. (I'll likely give it as a gift for my boyfriend's new townhouse, but I'd rather have kept it for myself if it had fit the King bed.)"
2,Poor Quality,"This is a beautiful quilt, but it started coming apart at the seams within the first month. We took great care in it's washing and handling. Very disappointing."
2,quilt,the quilt began to fall apart right after it was washed for the first time. Overall I am not happy with the quilt.
3,"Beautiful, but comes apart in the laundry","I love this quilt, but it did come apart in the wash in some squares. I think it's pretty enough to just repair, but others who aren't handy with a needle would do well to avoid it."
4,Good just to have on hand,"I wanted to have a baby food cookbook on hand, just in case the internet was down. All of the info in this book - or any baby food book - is available for free if you look for it. Try [...] to start.What I do like about this book, though, is the first half gives lots of good information about getting your baby started on food - frozen vs. fresh, organic vs. non organic etc. I enjoyed all the info and even told my husband he should read it. The recipes are really just clean, peel, cut, steam and puree whatever food you want. Each recipe does tell you what you can add (lemon juice, cinnamon, etc.) for a variation and what other foods to mix it with. The book also tells you what vitamins are in each food and at what age certain things can be introduced.Making baby food is not rocket science. If you just want something on hand, this book is fine."
4,Great Hardcore from Europe!,"Oddly, I think I was most attracted to this album by its cover and by slight word-of-mouth. The opening track to this album kicks @$$! The lyrics, although clouded in metaphors I found, are generally on the positive flip and uplifting. They definitely make you think. It's more metallic sounding than most sXe hardcore albums, but I like that. It's almost laden with hip-hop like grooves in some parts. Very nice! --Kelly Magovern"
4,The Shango Tour of 2001,"I have the Japanese version too, got it some years ago. It is a great disc to have because the live performance is really special with the African drummers and percussionists. They are great. The computer animation and effects are on every track and some times the quality of the picture is not so good. Othertimes the effects are pretty nice. So that is why I give it 4 stars. There are also some pictures on the DVD. It is also in 5 channel surround sound....."
2,Failure,"Renga, the singer (probably the best rock-voice in Italy) left the band after several great album for one reason: Pedrini, the led-guitarist and deus-ex-machina of the band wanted be God! A new singer, with mediocre voice, another servant at the court of king Omar Pedrini... The album is the second part of ""Senza Vento"", the best album of the band, but the result isn't the same. This time the songs are obvious, unoriginal, very weak in their ""construction"", but the real problem is another: the band, without a front-man as Francesco Renga is just the bad copy of the past one. There are 3 ""good songs"", singed very bad. The rest is ""nothing""."
2,coarse,Within 3 washings the pants became coarse and began to irritate my skin. Happened with 2 pairs.Pants look nice. Interior seam work not as good as competitors.
2,Baggy Pants,"Compared to the Gap, these pants run tight in the waist and long in length. It's hard to see the detail from the picture, but they are very casual looking as well, not quite as polished as what you'd get from Gap, BR or Dockers. The best thing about them is they are offered in smaller sizes."
2,Dirty Diablo,"I discovered this work one evening in a bookstore about twenty-fiveyears after it was first published and was struck by the first poem ofthe work entitled ""Nurse Whitman"" about poet Walt Whitman and his exploits in military hospitals during the American Civil War. While I do notremember much else of the controversial work, the first poem seemedto set the tone for the entire volume with its violent theme of war(the Civil War) and exploiting Whitman's alleged homosexuality witha bit of sexual innuendo. Themes of sex and violence permeate thiswork and, as the title suggests, casts a satanic spell over the genre."
2,He's got to be kidding,"Guess he needs the money. He's sort of the male version of Ana Nicole Smith, much more attention than his actions and decisions have deserved. Fact is though, some of his movies have been pretty good. If your a Segal fan I pity you, but you'd probably enjoy these. If you are Steven Segal - work with people making successful films, stop trying to push your own agenda!"
4,Great Soul Album,"This is the only Percy's record I've ever heard and I think it's great soul. Are 12 very poweful and beautiful songs that you can compare with those of Otis Redding and other great soul singers. Listen to the organ and the choirs, and put attention to the arrangements."
1,cheaper to toss it,worked great for 1 month then just stopped. would take more to fix than to replace. very disappointing
3,Radio reception is poor,"I've had this clock radio for a couple years. I still use it, but have found that the radio (FM) is very poor. Even when any other radio in the house picks up just fine."
2,alarm set doesn't function properly,There is no way to set this to go off with a buzzer even though the directions say it can. The only mode is for the radio alarm.
2,YUCK,This toy is the uglest thing ever. i used to collect dolls and all that jazz but now it's gross her hands and bigger then her nead almost! I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!
2,Well....,"When i toke the doll out, i thought cool a flexible body, I began to think she looked very akward though, i think her arms and legs are too big for the doll, so then i wanted to look at the clothes, and i just thought what has mattel done? i mean the whole hussy clothes are bad, i think mattel should make baby dolls or something, because like the whole family thing with barbie was just..... when i was 5 years old my mom didnt want me to have barbies, because she didnt want me to become a hussy, but my cousin got one, i was so exeicited i wanted to get one too, and with barbies i had learned how babies are made.... now i am 9 years old, and i now know that its a sick idea to use grown women and men as a barbie doll... and i dont want to be mean, the extra stuff was sorta cool, but overall i would give it a 2"
1,THIS IS A BLOB OF S***T,"is this doll on crack? the hands,feet and the head is huge!who is going to pay $49.99 for this pice of trash?."
4,"Good idea, needs some adjustments","While I very much like this doll and the idea behind it, I have one GIANT recommendation.... if you are going to make a cloth skinned doll, please don't provide clothing with velcro tape and loop closures. Did the people who designed this doll ever dress it? The velcro snags the skin fabric every time it gets near it. You don't need to redesign the doll, just find a different closure. Snaps? Ever heard of them?"
4,Mattel !!!,Mattel and amazon .com kids are writing reviews which include grammar mistakes and cursing the doll is a good item for any collecter don't diss her
1,aaaaaaaaaaaa what happend to this doll,"Don't get this my scene. Too big and weird.stick with the old, small my scene doll. The 1 and only my scene fan.I love my scene but not this one."
1,TOO BIG MY SCENE DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,it is so dumb stupid and ugly! stick to the regular dolls!
1,this doll stinks and you know it.,I think bratz are better then my scene. who is gon' pay $49.99 for this? . I think this doll looks really gross mattel does it agian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
1,A waste of time and money,"I bought my daughter this My Scene Styling Friend doll for her birthday. She loves all dolls and a friend recomended My Scene. Someone at school told her about 'A doll her size' and she cried for it. I gave in and purchased it. However, when she opened it, her dissapointment was clear. Her face went from excitment to dissapointment. I said ""Look! It's what you wanted? Don't you like it honey?"" and she said ""Mommy, i don't like it, it's ugly!"" and it sits in her room, untouched. She collects regular My Scene dolls, Bratz dollz, Winx Club dolls and Secret Central, but she still hates this doll."
2,oh really????,"o.k ''mew mew'' let me tell you something BRATZ RULE AND MY SCENE DROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. they call them ''bratz'' because they are angelz. and bratz have more fashon then my scene.so bratz are way better because (1),they are more pretty,(2),they make cameras,tvs,cd players,phones. and I think that pretty much makes bratz so better then my scene. thank you for reading this.p.s beyblade"
2,Really boring,"People have been fighting about this doll for months and i'm really getting fed up with it. Many people said it was ugly, gross and so on, so why don't they give us a new toy to talk about? I mean it's already been voted uncool. So lets talk about Bratz or robots or what ever else there is. I for one think it's a bad idea to have sold it to toy shops."
2,TOOT TOOT! this is the conductor of the ugly toys express,"what in the name of the moon happened to this doll? I don't know it looks like she got hit by a train, really i'm not jokeing."
1,this is bad for santa this year SO GET READY,my dog chewed the arms off and my brother poped the head off and stuck a ji joe head on it. so it's not vary durable.I just hope all you childern out have been good because it's looks like santa just took out the pearson's home and he's tossing ugly gross my scene dolls all over the place!. and thats not all this year he's going to be rolling down the block in a panzer!. so everybody log on (...) for more news about santa driveing a panzer this year. and go to email (..) to send a email to santa.p.s if you don't beleive me you will on chirstmas eve!.and this doll is boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!. bye.

4,Large undifferentated belt holder,"Holds some tools well as well as some other things. but if you put sharps in with everything else you are asking for problems. First the screws, nails, brads get dulled and second they scratch up stuff And puncture things including you. Also small stuff gets lost unless it is in its own containers. But very good constsrucion and it holds a lot."
4,big for low price,This is a large microwave for under $100.It is very easy to set up and program.I have had no problem with it and am very happy about mychoice.The only complaint might be it is that it takes up a lot ofspace.ccrusty
1,Disaster - i month before warranty expires!!,"Bought this July of 2008 because it was not made in China. However, entire midsection of the control panel stopped working 2 months ago, as did the minute-plus button. Had to resort to creative math to set times. Very finicky panel. Contacted Sharp. They identified a service provider nearby. Its now been 2 weeks. The panel he replaced seems to work, but according to him, something else is not working and so he has to order another part. We requested Sharp to replace the microwave, but they would rather pay a technician more money to try and fix a very finicky appliance than replace it. Beware of buying this piece of junk."
3,cooks fine - NOT intuitive controls,"The microwave works fine as far as cooking and defrosting, but the controls are terrible!We've had Sharp microwaves for YEARS (20+) and loved them. I've been using this one for a couple years and STILL have not gotten used to the controls.First I hate the fact that the door must be open to access most of them. Then, I just dont get them. My husband has the same problem, so it's not just me."
5,Love this product!,"Came in a timely manner, packaged well, looks sleek, has a lot of power and we love it. Would recommend this microwave to anyone."
5,Read the instructions,"This oven is beautiful, but I had to incinerate a couple of things before I was nudged into reading the instructions. I thought I knew enough about microwaves from years of using my old one. However, programming this one is a bit like the old video games where you run into the wall three times to get an extra life. Once you know how, it is easy, but there is no way you could figure it out without a cheat sheet.Now, I love this microwave and recommend it, but we did get off to a rocky start."
2,Movie,not the one i wanted .. but pretty cool anyways. thanks You all have a merry Xmas.. and a Happy new Year
3,A disappoinment,"An abbreviated review of military history spanning roughly the last two and a half centuries. Despite the promise of the title, there is little effort spent on the implications of evolution of military thought and technology on the actual practice of waging war."
3,"Something Ominous, Omnivorous in the Woods","This film keeps you guessing. The father of a family living on some potentially dangerous emotional fault lines, insists on their going camping into ever deeper isolation in the woods. The question becomes - is the father doing a lower budget version of ""The Shining,"" going mad there in the forest and turning on his family and any outsider who is hapless wnough to cross his path? Or is there really a ""Jersey Devil,"" a hyper-natural predator savagely hunting among the trees?The film goes somewhat over the top-the-top in presenting its resolution to the question. However, ""The Barrens"" is well and eerily photographed and held my attention most of the way."
3,A Decent Bit of Cheese,"If you're looking for a standard lost in the woods, scary-gory urban legend horror film, this is a pretty good one. If you're looking for anything beyond that, you will probably find ""The Barrens"" quite a waste of time.Pros:--Acting, script, and cinematography are better than many films in this genre;--Makes good use of anti-climaxes and dream sequences as well as effective vagueness regarding how human/inhuman the monster really is;Cons:--A lot of loose plot threads, as well as some irrelevant and derivative details: To quote one of the central characters, ""[What's] all this Blair Witch crazy s**t hanging from the trees""?;--Although it could be gorier--and I realize that some people like gore for its own sake--all the entrails assault the senses, and, while they're really grotty, both animal and human, they all look alike;--It would be more frightening to just give quick, patchy glimpses of the monster (or not show it at all), than to give such clear shots of the crazy thing."
1,gross,I didn't even finish the movie! I rented it because I like Stephen Moyer in True blood. Very disappointing to say the least.
3,"Well, I didn't hate it.",I like stories about cryptozoology. I think it had a sasquatch or something in it. Not really sure that I remember now.
1,the ultimate sin,"i wonder why people produce films whose screenplays are actually NOT SCARY? Yes, this film commits the ultimate sin for any so called horror film..IT'S BORING.........and why would a guy with a sever australian/new zealand/whatever accent say that his father took him to the barrens when he was a kid when hes obviously not from this country? C'mon man....give the audience a little respect!!!!! Blahhh......."
1,this is a really bad movie,"the casting & acting is horrible, and the story is just dumb. not scary at all. don't waste your time."
2,Shallow,"Movie was very shallow not much of a plot, after 30 mins u have figured out the dad was the bad guy.. not recommended unless u were stranded on a desserted island, with only 2 movies to choose from I would watch ""When Harry met Sally"" again b4 watching this movie ! especially if you only had enough battery life for 1 movie ! ha ha ha.. I watch a ton of thrillers/horror movies and this sucked !"
1,Warning 3 min spoilers!!!!!!,"Well let's just start with the first 2 min shall we, a Starbucks vocal commercial, a lump of blood and guts that resembles no woodland creature that has ever existed, a girl told by her b.f. ""not to come over here"" but does so anyways. Aft witnessing rubber clump and lucky rabbits foot she runs right into a tree on a path that's 10 feet wide, all while a deer is chasing them that mysteriously gets clawed and eaten by a creature that is apparently invisible. Instead of being scared I was reaching for a hanky to dry my tears of laughter. Fans of horror / thriller listen to me if you want a decent believable film about suspense in the woods check out Eden lake or a lonely place to die. At least those too films the acting is at very least believeable. oh and not to mention birds were infact chirping in the opening scene. Wow!"
2,Cheesy Does It,"I pre-ordered this CD hoping to hear more of Billy's bluegrass influence that he so nicely adds to The String Cheese Incident. Instead, this CD delivers your average rock and blues that is so prevalent on Liza's previous solo endeavors. I suspect that back when Billy and Liza used to play the small bars in Telluride, these two were local favorites however I find the songs on this outing to lack any of the catchiness or hook-laden jams of previous SCI efforts. If you are looking for a great CD of music featuring SCI with Liza filling in on background vocals, do yourself a favor and buy The String Cheese Incident's first CD entitled ""Born On The Wrong Planet"". Her background vocals on the title track are brilliant."
4,"More than readable, if a little unbelievable","Maybe if I started at the beginning and read all the Donovan books I'd accept some of the things that, having read only this one, seem a little too good to be true. For instance, that his wife is studying for the bar while being a black belt in Karote and raising a three-year-old disabled child. And that Donovan is the perfect dad and husband. I also thought most of what the three-year-old son did and said was more appropriate for a very smart five-year-old. (I have a four-year-old, highly verbal grandson, so I know whereof I speak.)Anyhow, I liked the plot, the NY/Brooklyn color, the relationship between Donovan and his partner Mosko, although again, Mosko was a bit larger than life and a bit too good to be true.Oh well, I read this for fun and fun it was."
2,Want to buy my copy?!,This book makes no sense to me and I think it's silly and foolish. Anyone who would like to buy my copy should email me!
2,Ok. But not for kids.,"Not happy endings and a lot of death.No plot. No climax. Booooooooring! But language was interesting. Basically, it w as ok"
3,Fits the phone,I bought this because it said it was a slim fit....and it was on sale. This case is really not too slim but it does work as a case.
2,Did not meet expectations,"The concept seems good. The ability to cut steel without all the problems of an abrasive cutoff saw, at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, my unit arrived with multiple flaws. The band saw mounts to the pivot arm at a single point with a single bolt, which is normally the front ""T"" handle. The pivot arm appears to have been improperly cast or machined, so that the setup geometry as specified in the manual was impossible to obtain. I considered shims to effect a ""kluge,"" but then there remains the second major flaw. The single bolt attachment to the upper case of the saw is not rigid enough. The result is that a small lateral pressure on the saw handle deflects the blade as much as 1/8 inch. Granted, better than hand held, but not acceptable to me. A nice concept, flawed in execution. Returned."
4,"""Good morning, I'd like to make a deposit.""","Very good for thumb fans. Quotable, funny. If you grew up on the Batman serials, like comic books, loved the movies, like comedy, hate Batman, like watching a thumb dressed like a blue chicken, or are in your right mind, watch this. You'll thank me."
4,Holy Hilarious Movie BatThumb!!,"Your right BlueJay, if you don't like this one, ""Your In, Your Ins.., Your Insane!!"""
4,Thumbs are still funny!,"Although none of the Thumb movies have surpassed the first in the series, Thumb Wars, they are all worth watching.Steve Oedekerk is incredibly funny and quite bizzare sometimes, and each Thumb movie needs to be seen by everyone.Bat Thumb is a good spoof of both the older Bat Man series and also the Bat Man movies.If you've never seen a Thumb movie, start with ThumbWars, then the Blair Thumb. Thumbtanic is pretty fun, and so now is Bat Thumb. If you're already a Thumb fan, then you want this one for your collection."
1,Dumb and Boring,"What a waste of time! Boring, Boring, Boring! Incredibly unfunny jokes throughout. After Thumb Wars, I thought that these would all be hilarious- not so. Stay away from this one. Get Thumb Wars or Thumbtanic instead."
2,Part IV in the Thumb series,"A very unfunny short and so far the worst in the series. There a few laughs, but not nearly enough to sustain watching the whole thing.The DVD includes: An ok commentary, mock behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, deleted scenes, storyboards, and trailers for all the Thumb films including the unreleased Frankenthumb and The Godthumb.This is the best DVD in the series for sheer number of extras, but the movie [is bad]."
5,"Odd, But Funny...","The Bat Thumb feature is only about 30 minutes, but it's packed full of silliness. I think it's good that the feature is so short because otherwise the joke might wear off, but it's perfect at this length. To fully appreciate this DVD, however, you MUST watch the extras. The behind-the-scenes and interviews with the characters are just as hilarious as the movie. I also have Thumb Wars, and I think the Bat Thumb DVD is better because of the extras."
1,Item not shipped,"Sept. 20,2001Gentlemen on Aug. 3,2001 I ordered this blade package with the Milwaukee Sawzall as of this date I have not recieved this blade package. The order form I recieved with the saw stated the blade package would be shipped later at no additional shipping cost. When can I expect to recieve the blade package. Thank you.Charles Halpin"
5,Good Soundtrack,"There are several great reasons to pick this up. 1.Foo Fighters ""The One"", its on the bonus DVD that comes with One by One so if you're only in it for the Foo's get OBO. 2. Offspring ""Defy You"", may be on their upcoming album, I don't know at this date. 3. Sugarbomb ""Hello"" is a great track, its hidden on the disc. 4. The Bryan Wilson contributions. Both are great and beautiful tracks. 5. Phantom Planet ""California"". Just sing along and annoy your friends. The rest of tracks are great too."
5,Orange County Soundtrack,"This is an awesome cd... it's just amazing to listen to, I love it! I'm SOOOOOOO confused tho! It says there's 14 tracks and I have 15 and the last songs my absolute favorite and... AH! I want to know who it's by! HELP!<3Bears"
3,Great soundtrack! but missing the best song...,"I LOVE this soundtrack, especially shadow stabbing by Cake, that's one of my favorite songs and the movie was HILARIOUS! but there's one song that's missing from the soundtrack- it IS my favorite song, the middle by Jimmy Eat World, that was playing when shaun came back from stanford in the truck and arlo and chad (his friends) were sitting in the car, it was playing in the background and that's the only bad thing about the cd"
4,Bonus track,"So you know, the Bonus track is actually a song called ""Hello"" by Sugarbomb-an awesome band from Ft. Worth, Texas. I hope you'll check out their other songs now that you know who they are!"
4,fruvous creates good winter album,"if you're expecting another bargainville, you may be surprised by wood. wood is overall a bit more shadowey and minor keyish, though it still captures that witty fruvous charm. it is an album to be solitary to, with a few sociable frolicings throughout. id recommend it to any fruvous fan to add dimension to the m.f. repetoire. fruvous-virgins will enjoy too."
2,Disappointment from a Moxy fan...,"Let me start by saying that I love this band. I've only seen them live once, but I have all their albums and have attempted to see them a number of times. Moxy is an incredibly tight band, and my overwhelming reaction to this album is that it's overproduced to the point where some very good playing is lost in a muddle of production that brings on listener fatigue too quickly. It's hard to care about intelligent lyrics and great songs when they're produced beyond listenability, and that's what happens for me in this album. The songs are solid compositions (and more) and have MF's traditional intelligence, but I cannot recommend the album because the great performances are ruined by the recording."
5,An Old Favorite,My aunt used to sing this to me when I was little. I always got such a kick out of the song. Now I enjoy sharing it with my son.
5,cute book and very happy with the used option,"love this book for my 2 year old boys, they make all the animal noizes and love the tickling with wriggly, jiggly spider. ends with the lady being ""full"" not ""dead"", which i liked for the little kids. we bought a used book and are very happy with the condition of the book."
1,Nightmares!!,"I've never been so horrified by a childrens book before in my life. If this doesn't cause nightmares, nothing will!! It's cute, for a 10 year old, not for anyone under the age of 10. The graphic images and story are a little too dark for a 2 year old. Think hard before buying this, there are other great rhyming and sing-song books out there."
3,Nice,"Not bad, once you get the hang of it. The programmed buttons take a little getting used to. The popcorn comes out perfectly! The little night light is difficult to find in the dark. The lighted clock is a nice feature."
5,Sharp Microwave Review,"I bought this item for my daughter, who lives over 600 miles away. Her reports about it have been extremely favorable. She indicates that she is well satisfied.Sharp R-402JW 1-2/5-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave, White"
5,Great product,Just purchased this Sharp microwave and couldn't be more pleased. It's replacing a microwave that's 20 years old.
4,awesome value. know what you're getting though.,"Being able to instantly read any Amazing Spider-Man comic is a dream. I hope this sells well enough for marvel to continue this. I can't recommend this enough.The 2 lone and insignificant caveats:1. These are hand-scanned images of the comics. So the old ones look a little washed out and all the ads are there (which I think is awesome, even the staple!)2. During most of the 90's, storylines frequently crossed through all the Spider-titles (Amazing, Spectacular, No Adjective). You only get the Amazing issues, so You'll get a lot of dead issues that leave you wondering what just happened and how it ends.Final note: If you get an annoying watermark on every page, get a new PDF reader. I use Adobe (free) with no problems."
5,Amazing Spider-Man Complete Comic Book Collection,A excellent bargain for any Spider-Man fan. It is on a cd-rom and requires either windows or mac. A definite 5 stars.
1,Garbage. If I could give it half a star I would.,"This is the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen. I love all of Necro's records. This DVD is nothing buy boring trash. Just his wack videos, behind the scenes stuff of his wack videos and then some wack home movies. It's not even funny like I thought it would be. For the longest time I thought about buying this, but thank goodness for Netflix. I don't typically review stuff, but I just had to warn people not to waste their money on this. Just buy his records. Leave this nonsense alone."
3,ok book,it is ok but i only wanted to draw big game such as deer and elk that are in North America in the wild not zoos such as the zebra it is just a waste of money to me
1,"The cheapest, shoddiest bookends imaginable","I've bought a lot of inexpensive bookends, but none were as poorly made as these. The metal is thin and pliable. The undersides have no felt, no rubber -- nothing to keep them from sliding on my bookshelf or to keep them from scratching my bookshelf. I would not recommend these to anyone else."
5,highly recommend.,"Book ends met expectations,sturdy,exact size,good price; shipped quickly.Very pleased with product. Would buy again or purchase additional. Very happy with purchase."
4,Great reading -- Even if you don't believe in horoscopes,I don't believe in horoscopes at all. Yet this book serves a very good purpose: an insightful and entertaining view of different personality types. You will certainly find yourself in one of them. The candid tips as well the description of the different characteristics of these personality types are well worth alone the book. You can easily ignore much of the horoscope thing itself and go deeper into the best side of this book.
3,Talk about middle of the road...,"This movie wasn't great...but it wasn't horrible either. The only reason I rented it was because I'm madly in love with Harry Connick Jr. To tell you the truth, he acted better in Hope Floats and Memphis Belle.In this movie, he plays a hit man who, unfortunately, can't bring himself to kill anyone. The role didn't suit him at all. All he really did was stand around and look pretty...and sing. Sarah Jessica Parker plays his love interest, a nice girl who accidentally kills her loser boyfriend. She's a little off balance throughout the movie, though. Like she's been handed this role and she doesn't know what to do with it. And Johnny Knoxville...he was in the first half hour and that was it. Why in the world is his name on the cover along with Parker and Connick, Jr.? He's a minor character at best.But still, the movie wasn't a total loss. There are some hilarious scenes that save the movie and make up for everything else. Rent it if you plan on wasting an afternoon."
1,*****GROAN*****,"Okay, granted this is probably one of Harry's first movies so we can excuse the fact that he simply cannot act in it.....BUT....what was Sarah Jessica Parker thinking of! She is the bright spot in this painfully dull movie and unfortunately she cannot carry the entire thing. I actually felt uncomfortable when Harry Connick Jr. attempted to say his lines. He was stiff and just plain bad. Even his gratuitous singing didn't fit in. And bear in mind that I LOVE Harry!! But this movie is a real groaner. Let's let it die a dignified death.....leave it on the shelf!"
1,HORRIBLE,I laugh at almost anything. This movie was supposed to be a comedy? The characters were annoying and it seemed like a kindergartner wrote it. Simple. There was not much too it. Do not buy or rent this movie for that matter. I couldn't stand to finish the movie. I shut it off before it ended...It was a failed attempt at comedy.
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"I am only bothering to write this to warn people away from this travesty of a film. It is horrible. HOR-RI-BLE! Written and directed by Bix Skahill, one of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 producers, I wonder if he didn't write it so that people could make fun of it. He should know better. Shame on you, Bix. Sara Jessica Parker and Harry Connick Jr. (and the rest of the b-grade actors in the film) seem embarrassed to be in it, mouthing their lines as if they were freshmen English students forced to read before class). It wasn't even fun to make fun of. Save your money!"
5,I love it!,"This movie is so funny! Fresh performances from all involved, it has become a new favorite!"
2,Castrate this film,"A dissapointment from Harry Connick Jr., but then I guess he doesn't get offered the A-roles at the moment. Oh but Harry, when you read the screenplay, didn't you see the train wreck coming? The screenwriting has horrible for this film. Perhaps the blame could be shifted to the editing if there were critical scenes left out that would have made the film's transistions and plausibility smoother. I doubt it. Poor writing for a black comedy with able actors makes for a poor movie that very few actors can pull out of a pit of mediocrity.Sarah Jessica Parker does an excellent job at portraying herself, and Harry Connick Jr. seems a bit confused onscreen at times, I think wondering like myself why he ever let his agent talk him into this role.Harry Connick Jr. lovers: go see Hope Floats or Copy Cat and save your money on this one."
1,Slower than watching my mom write a check at the market,"Man, this was one slow movie. A lot of SJP's giggles and gam, but not enough substance. I bet that even Parker and Connick wouldn't watch this one. You shouldn't bother, either."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","This movie was so bad that I had to turn the tape off. That was about 40 minutes into the movie. There is no story, and the characters are wooden and flat at best. I can't recommend anyone see this movie. Wait for reruns of Sex And The City, or Jackass. This movie is just too painful to watch."
3,"Great Voices, Bad Album Sequence of Tracks","Only Camile Velasco's song, ""Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do),"" sounds great on the CD. Her recorded voice undeniably ranks #1 among the top 12. I hope she will release nationally a music CD of her own. A distant second place goes to John Stevens whose voice is a combination of Rick Astley-Kenny Rogers in ""You Are Everything."" Too bad that Jasmine Trias was assigned a song, ""Midnight Train to Georgia,"" that didn't match her enchanting voice, but she's up there for third place. I also like the background sound of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Matt Rogers. He is 4th, and Diana Degarmo and La Toya London tie for 5th. Fantasia sounds here like Aretha Franklin - the original Queen of Soul - but her vocals aren't that fantastic to the ear."
2,Fantasia sucks!,"Overrated and very ghetto, this swellheaded over-the-top contestant has such an annoying squeaky voice that she could probably work at the fire station, replacing the alarm."
3,FANTASIA AND LATOYA ARE THE REAL DEAL!!!!,"The only reason I bought this album was for Fantasia and Latoya, If there were the only ones singing it get a 5, but I have to suffer through the rest of the performers killing the other songs....You people need to buy some Q-tips because you obviously cant hear and dont have any sense of what talent is. Fantasia and LaToya are the only two WHO CAN SING!!!! These ladies are talented, beautiful and have star quality!! Get used to hearing those names, because they WILL Be around for a long time!! Fantasia and Latoya are DIVA's...accept it and move on..."
3,"Some good, some bad","*""Chain of Fools"" by Fantasia: Poor. Squeaky, ugly voice. F.*""Me and Mrs. Jones"" by George: Cool. A-.*""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" by Diana: Good. A-.*""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" by La Toya: Tops! A.*""Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye) by Jennifer: Over-the-top. B-.*""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by Amy: Good.

A-.*""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by ensemble. Too much Fantasia and Jennifer. F."
4,The Duck sucks!,"Isn't it enough that we hear her quacking night after night on the AI show? Now, we have to be punished by being bombarded with the constant squeaking right at the very start of the album? The producer of this album made a bad choice by including this overrated non-singer among this group of gifted future artists!"
1,FANTASIA SUCKS!,"One doesn't need to hear Simon say it to realize that she sounds like Donald Duck (my apologies, Donald Duck). One just has to have an ear and anyone that doesn't realize s/he is listening to squeaking is deaf.I won't be surprised if she ends up second to deserving winner La Toya (or if she even wins), because at the rate people are suddenly turning deaf, this swellheaded ghetto girl with the annoyingly squeaky voice (hmm... I like that phrase; very apt for Fantasia Duck Barrino) is on her way to no-talent (ala Madonna or Britney Spears) stardom!"
2,"Fantasia ""Donald Duck"" Barrino has the worst voice","among the remaining finalists. She's just plain irritating to listen to.As many others have pointed out, there are only two that have good voices: La Toya (who should win) and Jasmine."
3,Enough of this Fantasia thing already!,"Yes, we all know she sucks! But people love personalities like her who have (bad) attitude and no talent (just look around you -- there's the ever-popular Britney Spears, for one). Expect her to win this compeition of non-talents!"
3,Great except for Fantasia!,"Everyone performs well here, even the perennially nervous Camille Velasco who seems perfect for recordings. The exception is overrated contestant Fantasia Barrino, who does nothing but squeak. Her style is sooooo annoying!"
1,FANTASIA IS HORRIBLE!,Doesn't sing; only SQUEAKS. So annoying to listen to. She ruins this whole album with her presence!
3,Okay,"It's Camille who does surprisingly well in this album. Other voices that are pleasant to listen to are Jasmime's and La Toya's.All the others are second-rate. Jennifer always delivers over-the-top performances, George always picks the wrong style of singing for the song, John has a very limited style, Diana always screams her head off, while Fantasia, who has the worst vocal timbre in this competition, always squeeks like a mouse.This album doesn't have much to offer."
4,"Camille and Jasmine,,,, i like!!!!","well, well, well, say goodbye to diana and fantasia... these two girls really rock the house... i bet they'll be recording artists someday... this is superb!!! greatly made by wonderful singers... so buy and listen for yourself...true, its really good! try to love the classics,,,aint no mountain high enough!love u jas and cam!!"
4,It's pretty good.,"You can't expect much. Maybe that's why I liked it. You have to really like oldies. It was like listening to really talented people sing kareoke. You sit there and think to yourself, some of these people could really sing. Many of the songs are very difficult to sing. I thought they all did a pretty good job."
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This,"Amazon is selling this CD for .93 cents, but don't waste your money on it. For .93 cents I could buy a postage stamp and a piece of Bazooka Joe gum. This is nothing but karaoke music and you're way better off just downloading the songs from the original artists. And Leah Labelle should have been 2nd runner up on American Idol. She had charisma, style, and a voice. I'm waiting for her album to drop. So skip this and wait for Leah's album to come out."
4,Fantasia is Fantastic,"All of you who are out there trying to put Fantasia down need to go and get a life. Here is another young, talented, female who just happens to be a single mom trying to make it in this sooo messed up world. So what if she had a child at the age of 17. Who are you to judge? Maybe this world would be a better place if some of you were like Fantasia. Fantasia will only be judged by God for what she has done in her life. I know for myself that he is a forgiving God and all things are possible through him. Fantasia seems as though she has a strong belief in the Lord and if she keeps the faith she will make it very far in life. I do feel Zion will go a long ways in life with the help of her mother (Tasia). She has a better opporunity at everything now. So take a step back and re-think all the negative things that some of you dumb-dumbs have said. Be proud of her for what she has accomplished.Fantasia, YOU ARE THE #1 AMERICAN IDOL, I commend you! JOB WELL DONE!"
4,SOME SONGS SUCK!,This cd sucks..actually all the american idol cds suck.. Season 2 was the best season EVER!
4,Okay,"""Chain of Fools"" by Fantasia: Non-singers shouldn't be allowed to record. F.""Me and Mrs. Jones"" by George: A-.""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" by Diana: A-.""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" by Toya: The best in the competition. A.""Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye) by Jennifer: Should have been eliminated early on. B-.""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by Amy: B+.""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" by Matt: B.""Midnight Train to Georgia"" by Jasmine: Great personality. International appeal. A-.""My Girl"" by JPL: B-.""Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"" by Camile: Sexy. A-.""Betcha By Golly, Wow"" by Leah: B-.""You Are Everything"" by John: A-.""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by the whole group. The non-singer is allowed to dominate everyone. F."
2,"Yes, Fantasia has a very SQUEAKY voice!","So irritating to listen to. As someone else has said, only two people have really good voices: La Toya and Jasmine. Jennifer and Diana are good only at screaming. The rest have no talent."
3,Produced by the best and the worst in the business,"***** The best tracks: James McMillan, Producer; Engineers: Bob Gilderman and Rob Chiarelli.Attention to detail and evident effort was expended here. Great job, fellas!* The worst tracks: Sturken & Rogers, Producers; Engineer: Al Hemberger. Disappointing, humiliating, and embarrassing...These are ""hit-makers"" that did not bring their game. I feel bad for Sturken & Rogers and felt they have ruined their reputation as serious artists. As far as the engineering goes, The ""burger"" brothers need to go back to school... The ""balance"" and space in these tracks was absolutely horrific. Bad punches, artifacts and general mushiness is the sum of this abomination. The losers end up being these fine vocalists that people are now calling ""amateurs."" All Produced by Sturken & Rogers: George, Diana, Latoya, Amy, Leah, & John. You deserved a better effort!"
2,Fantasia sucks!,"She should have been booted out early in the competition and not allowed to mess up this recording. Her over-the-top singing (along with Jennifer Hudson's) ruined the ""group"" song that should have been a showcase of the harmony of EVERYONE's voice!"
3,"Yes, Fantasia sucks!","Unfortunately, she can't do anything about her screechy voice. We should just take Donald Duck out of this competition!"
1,Mickey Mouse Barrino should be the next one out!,"Or Diana or George.La Toya London, with the nice voice (unlike squeaky Fantasia or Screamy Diana) and with the consistently good performances should win this competition!"
2,Another squeaky performance from Donald Duck!,"If Fantasia (or screaming Diana) ends up second to deserving winner La Toya, this will more than emphasize the sad state of no-talent pop stardom in America.The exposure of trying-hard singers should stop with this album."
3,"La Toya boring, Jennifer over-the-top, but...","nothing beats the overrated, no-talent showcase of Fantasia's squeaking!"
3,fantasia im sorry i dun like ur voice,hey guess what i seriously feel that fantasia shouldnt have win. i think many of us also feel that way because we all hate her voice. diana should have won . I would have rate it five if not for fantasia. I thought the best few singers are latoya jennifer diana george and JPL
2,get off your soapboxes.,"obviously fantasia doesnt suck because shes still in the competition isnt she?and seriously, this is a review for a cd, not for the show itself.personally, i think george's & fantasia's were the only good performances."
2,Disappointing,"I cannot believe that they made such a weak album. The contestants should've sticked with their original songs in the competition.Though Diana did a great job with "" I heard it thru the grapevine"" it would've sounded better if Fantasia sang it.And if Diana's version of ""Think"" is included in this album, it would've been worth every cent I paid to have this shipped overseas.It's good though that (Sittin' on) The dock of the bay is included. Though of course George Huff can't sing two songs in this album, Matt did a pretty okay version.The rest are just as weak as a dead plant.And I am supposed to be a big fan of this season!"
1,Re: Don't hate on (sic) Fantasia,"What soulful voice are you talking about? There's nothing except DONALD DUCK SQUEAKS that come out of this screechy lady's mouth! And don't insult Tamyra and Kelly by comparing trying-hard-ghetto Fantasia with them. As Simon would say, they're in a totally different class!"
4,Latoya,Latoya London is the best singer on the album and was the best singer on the show. Diana is cool too but the rest suck!
3,"Loved Jennifer, but","as for the rest, pretty unspectacular. Jennifer's powerhouse vocals are worth the price of this CD anyway -- all by themselves. So glad she's had a chance to show her talents and shine. (So there Simon Cowell)"
3,Good effort,"I thought that this album was good. Fantasia Barrino is still the best here. I commend them for going after some meat this time with the soul classics. Some singers do need work--John Stevens sounds too dull, Matt sounds too karaoke, Diana DeGarmo still sings too LOUD, and Jasmine Trias still can't deliver on the ballads. But Jennifer, Latoya, and George have the strongest numbers on here. George just tore it up on Me and Mrs. Jones--I didn't think he would do Billy Paul's classic, but he pulled it off. But this was a smartly done project and they got to sing real songs instead of the middle of the road fluff they have to sing on the show."
3,Everyone's a winner in my view!!!!!!!!,"Good stuff from good kids - everyone's a winner here!! The only downers on this record are the ones by John ""dullsville"" Stevens, who tries too hard to sing and act like Simply Red, and George ""you-snooze-you-lose"" Huff. Otherwise, like Hammer used to say - ""Ya can't touch this!!!"" Winning songs on this CD include Fantasia's track; this girl is the next Patti Labelle, I kid you not. Another winner is Diana's track; it's easy to see why this 16-year-old sensation made it to the final round against Fantasia.THE HAWAIIAN CHICK'S SONG AIN'T BAD EITHER!!!ENJOY IT AS YOU WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Ain't no mountain high enough...,"for the other girls. Not for Fantasia, though, who'll have to climb mountains to be an appealing star. She's too self-absorbed in her performances. She doesn't know how to blend in. Even in this GROUP song (track 13), she tries to overshadow everyone -- as if her big head and diva attitude weren't huge enough already!If she doesn't change (she doesn't have a good voice to begin with), she's going nowhere. She should be next one voted off this competition!"
3,I agree. Only two have good voices.,"La Toya who should win and Jasmine who should be runner-up. As many others have pointed out, Fantasia's squeeky voice is just plain annoying, while Diana's better off screaming into the open seas. The others are inconsequential."
4,Nice album!,"Would have been better if more appropriate songs for some of the contestants were chose, but overall, good. Pleasant surprise were Camille and John Steven's performances."
3,Nice voices...pedestrian production values,"I'm impressed with the vocal performances. However, the instrumental tracks have a claustrophobic workstation sterile sound. The mixes are safe and stagnant, with only slight dynamic pushing. Overall, I was surprisingly pleased with what I heard. Some of the singers show themselves much more adept ""recording"" artists than as yet they have shown in televised live performances."
2,Not as good as last year...,"I haven't watched the show to see their progession, but I do think at this point, most of them weren't very exciting. George and LaToya shined, though. I was VERY impressed with them...especially George. GREAT soul voice! I did think Diana and Amy had pretty good potential. I just don't think the others were quite ready yet. Sorry."
2,NOT WORTH BUYING...,"Camile Velasco, Matt Rogers, Jon Peter Lewis, John Stevens, Jasmine Trias and Diana DeGarmo suck. Their voices are so terrible and flat, especially Camile Velasco's.On the other hand, Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, Amy Adams, George Huff, Leah LaBelle and La Toya London had great voices. Just go listen to their AI songs, so you won't have to buy this worthless album."
1,BLA,"ok, I really didn't see this CD, but I'm just writing this review to fix something I did, so don't mind me."
2,Fantasia and Jennifer SUCK!,"It's good that Jennifer's been eliminated already. Next one to go should be the overrated 'Donald Duck on helium' Fantasia, whose only talent is squeaking her way through her songs (same with Diana whose best talent is screaming her lungs out).This competition should be based not only on presence and personality, which only two contestants (as many reviewers have noted) have, but also on vocal quality. Although I know she won't win (since people love ""ghetto swellheads"" such as Fantasia, as one reviewer aptly put it), La Toya is the one who DESERVES to win!"
1,WTF-How the hell does Fantasia Win,The real Idol 3 is Diana thats the truth Fantasia was aiight but Diana sings like Aguilera and Fantasia sings like the 1920s I will bet that Diana will have much more sucess Fantasia is not the best ever Simon is to easy you want a real mean son of a gun pick me I ve liked 2 people Rubben Studdard and DianaFantasia will have an ole soul album but Diana will be the talent you were wrong america you suck and always have to pick because of politically correct but Diana is the correct response.Randy Jackson sucks and Paula Abdul sucks Goodnight
1,PURE CRAP: American Idol does it again!,This music is so pathetic and disgusting it makes me want to swallow dog vomit. Why listen to these miserable imitations when I can go and buy the ORIGINAL renditions? It is like wanting to go watch your high school band play instead of the London Symphony.Perfect for 10-14 year old girls. Anyone outside of that age range that listens to this should be run over by Simon's car. I bet you listen to Blink-182 and R. Kelly the child-molester as well.
4,Only 2 sounds good for me!,The Bests!1 Jasmine Trias2 Jennifer Hudson3 Latoya London4 George HuffGood!5 Fantansia6 Camile Velasco7 Diana Degarmo8 Matt RogersBad!9 Amy Adams10 John Stevens11 Leah Labelle12 JPL
4,fantasia,"fantasia sounds earthy, raspy, soulful, and amazing on her track. everything else ranges from dull to good.i for one would be embarrassed to be one of the chorus out there parroting simon's ""donald duck on helium"" comment. doesn't anyone have anything more original to say? i mean, i get that she's an acquired taste, but the donald comparison is neither particularly interesting or apt."
3,2 Artists Shine on This Album,"Those 2 artists are: Fantasia and Jennifer Hudson, they are just amazing. Latoya London is good, but more than slightly boring. Diana Degarmo is alright, but makes up for it with personality-plus. The rest of the group are DUDS, sorry. Get Fantasia's album, and wait for Jennifer's to come out, which I'm sure will be soon."
2,"Definately for the fans only, very weak..........","This is a throw together CD and very weakly produced. There are some highlights such as Camille's ""Until You Come Back To Me"" and Matt's ""Sitting At The Dock of the Bay"". If you're a fan of the show, definately get this. If not, don't waste your money."
4,I never thought I'd say this,"I couldn't wait for her to be voted off American Idol, but now I realize I was wrong. Camile Velasco is the best singer of the bunch. Her song on this CD is phenomenal. She can really sing when she's not so nervous. I now realize that nerves were her undoing. If you had to pick the Idol from just listening to this CD, she'd win hands down. She has a unique voice (her tone is amazing) and sang this song perfectly. This song could be a major hit as a single. Given her age, any record company would be making a wise investment by signing her - ASAP!"
3,"SOUL CLASSICS CD - OK, NOT GREAT","I just listened to this CD a few days ago and I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the recordings of some of the contestants. Some of them sounded way too high-pitched, and their voices sounded somewhat airy and lacked the depth of their true voices. Also I felt that some of the songs lacked instrumentation. The only two songs that I really enjoyed were Fantasia's and George's renditions. Their voices sounded true to nature and had enough orchestration/instrumentation to keep the listener attentive til the end of the songs. I hope when the contestants record their own CD, they use another recording company. It was just amiss for me."
1,Greatest?,Greatest Soul Classics? not even close!some of these renditions of classic soul songs are awful!
3,No point for finalists cyring over voted off fellows,"With the exception of one finalist (probable winner La Toya London), ALL of them are going to suffer the same fate anyway; it's just a matter of who leaves first. So there's no point in feeling sorry for whoever gets voted off, since no one among them is actually any better than the rest. In the end, they'll all be voted off, they're ALL losers, and they'll ALL be in the same boat."
3,Fantasia ruins this album,"The album's generally okay, with interesting and some surpisingly good performances here and there. Fantasia's tracks (Chain of Fools and Ain't No Mountain High Enough) make for a bad copy, however. The producers should have excluded her and the other overrated, over-the-top contestant, Jennifer-something."
3,Fantasia the Duck has the worst voice!,"Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack! She's better off recording children's songs, playing the part, appropriately, of Donald Duck.What a quack! Ha ha ha!"
3,La Toya Is going to be a star,"With or without American Idol, La Toya is going to be a star. The only reason I am going to buy this album is because of Her redention of ""If you dont know me by now."" I need a whole album full of her so this show needs to hurry up so she can be a solo star. Because how the system works its a chance she'll get robbed so if she does its just a headstart for a wonderful career that I know she'll have. Good Luck to Jennifer and Fanatasia also!!!!"
5,it's a perfect album but spoilt by FANTASIA,i so get what the producers are doing when they placed fantasia's song upfront so everyone could get to skip it and enjoy the rest of the album.everyone did so well besides fantasia BELIEVE ME ! like woah even the ones like jasmine jennifer george n stevens did so well which i dint quite like 'em in the competion thumbs up to everyone besides fantasiai've got nothing to say abt squeaking duck all the other reviews speaks for themself.
2,"Good genre, bad idea","Actually most of these songs are classics with good reason. However, it is unrealistic to expect children to understand what a song like ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" means. It has nothing to do with being technically good or bad singer, however to sing about life you must first have one. George Huff does a plesant, if dull, ""Me and Mrs Jones."" However, the only must have track on the whole cd is Barrinos and you can get that elsewhere. The rest of the cd is full basically decent covers that are just a little too close to their distinctive originals."
3,Good Good @ Good,"Our family really enjoys the CD. It has alittle something on there for all of us. I wish all the artists the Best in Life. We're EXCITED about them comimg to our home town of Grand Rapids,MI. We sure will see you there!!!!"
4,Fantasia Rocks,"I purchased this cd on Friday after listening to the samples and reading the reviews on this site. The album is nice. My favorite is Chain of Fools by Fantasia. I can't say that I agree with the comment that she sounds so Macy Gray. She has her own sound. Everyone can't feel it but it is refreshing for those who can appreciate her style. I wish Latoya could have sung Neither One of Us or Midnight Train to Georgia. Amy has a very nice voice, I would like to hear more from her. Everyone else was fairly decent. When you have grown up hearing the originals, you have to adapt to their versions of the songs. Overall pretty neat CD."
3,It's Camille!,Camille is the star of this CD. Unique voice. Great performance.George was pretty good too. No one else blew me away.Just an ok CD.
3,Fantasia sucks!,"Like Diana, her only asset is screaming. But unlike Diana with the loud not-yet-mature voice, Fantasia's is very screechy. She couldn't hit the low notes during her boring first number on AI tonight, and all she did during the second part was ruin the beautiful Barbra Streisand song by squeaking her way 'till the end.La Toya should win this competition."
2,Fantasia is horrific!,"This swellheaded ghetto girl needs some reality check. She CAN sing, but her squeaking is not of record-able quality. Neither will her attitude gain her more fans.Donald Duck would be insulted to be compared with her!"
2,Jennifer Hudson was never that good!,"And she was never been popular - in fact, she had been in the bottom groups many times. Fantasia is OVERRATED; her ""Donald Duck in helium"" voice is so ANNOYING to listen to. George always sings either the wrong song or the wrong style.I like La Toya. Although she's also one of those ""not so popular"" contestants (having been in bottom groups many times, too), she's the most consistent performer in this group. Jasmine is good, too (good voice) -- she just needs to polish her performances. Camille is surprisingly good in this recording -- too bad she was weak in the actual competition.The male contestants, except for John Stevens, should have been eliminated fom this competition ages ago!"
3,Only two singers have good voices,"That's La Toya and Jasmine. Fantasia with her cartoon character voice should be the next one kicked out, or George with the inappropriate attacks on the songs, or Diana whose only expertise is yelling.La Toya should win this one."
3,Fantasia bad influence on this CD!,Her very nasal voice and crass interpretation of songs are the greatest liabilities of this album. The producers should have just taken her out completely and the album would have turned out a lot nicer to listen to!
1,Fantasia Barrino's annoyingly squeeky sounding-voice...,is better off heard in the annoyingly squeeky-sounding overrated show Hairspray.
4,Fantasia - out!,"1. Fantasia (Chain Of Fools) - Nothing new, nothing special. As bad as her TV performances. Grade: F2. George(Me And Mrs. Jones) - Good. Grade: B3. Diana (I Heard It Through The Grapevine) - Good. Grade: B+4. La Toya (If You Don't Know Me By Now)- Wow! Grade: A5. Jennifer (Neither One Of Us)- Overdone vocals. Grade: D6. Amy (You Make Me Feel Brand New) - Good. Grade: B7. Matt (Sittin On The Dock Of The Bay)- Okay. Grade: B-8. Jasmine(Midnight Train To Georgia) - Lovely. Grade: A-9. JPL (My Girl)- Okay. Grade: B-10. Camille (Until You Come Back To Me)- Wow! Grade: A excellent! 10/1011. Leah (Betcha By Golly Wow)- Okay. Grade: B-12. John (You Are Everything)- Good. Grade: B13. Ensemble (Ain't No Mountain High Enough)- The Duck's squeaky voice towers over everyone's. Grade: D-Good CD overall. Delete Fantasia's number and re-do the ensemble and this album will improve significantly."
3,"What's the big deal, indeed!","11 out of the 12 are all going to be voted off, so there's no point in comparing whether Diana or Fantasia or Jasmine is better than this-and-that-singer: La Toya will win and EVERYONE ELSE will lose. Get it? ALL the finalists except for La Toya will end up as LOSERS! They'll all go through the same thing, so these three indeed shouldn't be crying for the ones being voted off right now because they, too, will have their time. Only one will win and the rest will LOSE! So who cares whether it's Diana or Fantasia or Jasmine who gets voted off next -- they will all LOSE and experience the same thing! So get over this ""I hope this-and-that contestant remains in the competition,"" because she will DEFINITELY be voted off!American Idol should just have all finalists sing in one episode then on the same night decide whom they want to give the prize to, instead of prolonging this unnecessary agony and false hopes on everyone!"
4,All of Fantasia's fans need to quit,"I understand why people talk about Fantasia's personallife. American Idol is just about that: being America's IDOL. It's not just about musical talent, it's about how one conducts oneself in private or in public; she should be good enough to be considered an IDOL.Fantasia can't sing her a** off, plain and simple. My mother thinks she squeaked Chain of Fools too bad that it doesn't sound even close to the original. I'm not surprised that her CD is having problems with sales although the rank's going up. The show is about being an idol.Fantasia's lucky that being a ""novelty"" was a factor in Fox choosing her for the title. Otherwise if it were based on talent along (which she doesn't have), she wouldn't even have reached the top 12.She's the liability of this album."
5,"good tunes!!... JPL's ""My Girl"" blew me away!!","this is a wonderful soul selection!! and JPL's rendition of 'My Girl' blew me away!! he is definately made for the studio!! this is way better than when he was on the show, and he was awesome on the show!!! you go boy... can't wait to see you on the tour!!"
2,No tech support,Scanmaker made by Microtek no longer offers telephone tech support. The only reason I purchased the product was to transfer images from 35mm negatives to my computer and produce photographs.Without tech support I am unable to figure out how to adjust the various settings to reproduce the image from the slides or film strips.Microtek ScanMaker 9800XL Scanner with Transparent Media Adapter
2,"Great, when it works ...","The scanner is exception, when it functions. The software that comes with it is barely usable and crashes often. That said, when I upgrade the software, it did change the situation: It went from crashing often to crashing every time. Even the ""photoshop plugin"" is merely a call to launch the software - when again crashes."

3,helpless little baby Mighty God,"Christmas contains within much which can be explained. But the mystery of Christmas is shown in the description of a helpless little human baby as Mighty God. How we handle the phrase ""he shall be called"" informed much of the paradox. Of course, no devotional book can explain the mysteries of God."
5,Exactly what it says it is.,"Exactly what it says it is: Nothing more, nothing less. The build quality is high, the bypass fuse weather resistant if not weather proof. All in all, a quality job all around."
1,Big Disappointment!,"My family and I have bought a lot of items from Amazon over the years with good success. Until this product. After wearing the watch for five weeks to my white collar office job, the gold has worn off one link on the bracelet already. Excluding the problem with the bracelet the watch is fine. But it has only been 5 weeks. Too bad this problem didn't happen within the 30 day return window. I am really disappointed and will reconsider how I shop while warning my family and friends. I plan to call Amazon and see if they will help me."
5,Invicta Praise,"Everyone has covered the great atributes of this watch so all I can say is, it's impossible to improve on perfection. You will enjoy this watch great appearance durable inexpensive."
2,My brand new broken watch,"I received this watch after ordering it through Amazon a week ago and when I got it, it had a small crack in the crystal and went further as I wore it. I plan on sending it back. It keeps good time but it is broken."
5,Great watch,This is great buy I have bought 3 so far .2 for myself and 1 for my Dad I am going to buy more for Christmas gifts.
1,MOLESTA,"ME ENCUENTRO MOLESTA POR QUE PAGUE POR ESTE RELOJ Y NUNCA LO RECIBI, NECESITO QUE ALGUIEN ME DE INFORMACION DE QUIEN ME PUEDE RESPONDER POR ESTE PRODUCTO O QUE HAGAN LA DEVOLUCION DEL DINERO. MUCHAS GRACIAS"
2,Cheap Gold Plating,"I received this watch as a gift. I have worn the watch 3 days. The gold on the band has already rubbed off 3 links.Very very very cheaply gold plated. I was able to rub it off with my finger and very little friction.I will not be buying another Invicta. I love the watch but i paid for the gold on the band, i expect for the gold to not rub off within the first 3 days. I have literally worn this watch less than 72 hours.I may return the watch because of the quality. Email Sales@dynamicbargain.com if you want pictures of the watch after 3 days of normal wear. I sit at a computer 8 hours a day, no rough use at all."
1,Defective one hour out of box,BEWARE - Cheap watches are cheap watches - regardless of looks. This watch worked for one hour out of the box - then froze never to work again. Returned.
5,Invicta Pro diver 8927,"This is my fourth Invicta diver's watch - they are very well made watches - never thought I'd own more than one at a time, but these are great buys and having a diffewrent look for different occasions is fun. It's a heavy watch and works well in and out of the water. I take it surfing about once a week. Keeps perfect time and looks like a Rolex at a fraction of the cost - highly recommended."
5,excellent watch for such a price,"when I orderd this watch , i was not sure if would look ellegant compared to the price i paied , but when i recieved it it looked relly very very cheap for its looks and quality , it is very valuable watch , thanks to AMazon for their recommendation"
2,Good looking but Didn't Work!,"Good looking watch, a little large though but regardless it didn't work! The stem was frozen - couldn't pull it out to set it! That's the bad news, the good news was how easy and painless the return process was!"
1,crappy watch,Gold rubbed off after a week. The band broke easily. This was the worst watch ive ever owned. Better off with a walmart watch.
1,Not worthy of the Invicta name,Invicta should be ashamed of putting their name on this watch. I bought one a few years ago in blue and it's awesome. Now I saw it in black and thought I'd get it too. It was defective right out of the box- couldn't wind it manually. So much for quality control.
5,looks good,I buy it for the nice two looking colors of the metal and yellow gold with the black face dial.But I was tempted to buy another model of the invicta:the model 8929-gold tone black automatic diver.!!!Now this is a real beautifull watch!!!.The gold tone color of this model(8929) opaque the good looking of the two tone invicta model(8927).If you look inside of the dial you can note a difference between this two model:the 8927 havea steel color in the circle wall inside of the dial but the 8929 have this section with a gold tone color.This make the watch more attractive and elegant.A friend of my buy me the 8927 model and I keep the 8929 model for my own use.I understand this is my personal opinion and others people have a different taste to select a watch.
3,ROBIN'S ROAD TRIP,"RV is the kind of movie Robin Williams used to make before he started tackling more ""serious"" roles. Williams uses his reliable manic persona, toned down somewhat, to play an advertising man out to save his career and his family. After a big deal forces him to postpone a planned family vacation to Hawaii, he cons his brood into taking a trip to Colorado in a rented RV instead ""to help bring the family together."" His real motive, however, is to make the meeting scheduled there and get his proposal ready for his arrogant boss (Will Arnett). There isn't a whole lot to laugh about in the movie, as we all know how things will turn out in the end. En route, the family meets a strange family, led by Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth, who appear to be rednecks but are really much more the kind of family Williams and his wife (Cheryl Hines) want to be.A more slapstick style of humor might have made this a lot more enjoyable, but as it is, it's pleasant enough entertainment."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Long before being cast in the leading role of the Hunger Games, Josh Hutcherson was still doing movies. One of his first major roles was as the white homie in RV. For those of you who say Robin Williams is done and that he doesn't make funny movies anymore, I guess you haven't seen RV. Unlike Williams previous hits, it's not raunchy and it won't tick off any particular group in America, but it's still a cute comedy, and Williams is as funny as ever. Williams proves in this film, that a good comedian is always funny, and that you don't necessarily need to be raunchy or obscene to be funny. RV was for the most part a family film, with way too many jokes about doody, but it was still good for killing a few hours with a few good laughs."
3,RV-DVD,The DVD is great and funny. Robin Willaims was great. I Loved the movie and so did my friends. I recieved the dvd case was cracked and the mailer was ripped(damaged). I would recommend the movie to everyone. Two Thumbs Up!!!
4,Comedy,This was a funny movie. Reminded me of what my childhood vacations would of been like if I had taken any.
1,Very boring unfunny movie!,"I love robin william's movies especially his older ones their a classic and he's a great actor too but this movie was such garbage and if I could give it a 0 stars I would. It saddends me to see a great actor like robin williams playing as a sensitive character who's family just hates him and doesn't appreciate his hard work to support his own family. Jojo is the main character I hate she's an arrogant selfish whiny little brat especially when she says after she discovers the rv infront of their house, OMG IT'S YOUR HUSBAND! (yeah no respect). Yes I know it's just a movie for our entertainment and people are going to correct me but still it wasn't funny to me and I think this movie just promotes teenage brats of today, in other words they make 15 year old girls look bad as always.Overall I hate this movie but robin williams is a great actor and I love pretty much all of his movies except this crap."
4,Not a great film but fun to watch,"It was pretty good - not fantastic mind you, but entertaining. There were parts of it that were very funny especially if you enjoy slapstick comedy. It's about a family that takes a road trip in an RV and meets up with another family who they keep trying to avoid. Plus it has a side story about their father-daughter relationship. Not a great film but it was fun to watch."
3,Ok.....but,Not wonderful. Ok for a rental if nothing else to rent. Seen Robin Williams do alot better than this one...but still this was ok.
2,More yuks (sound of disgust) than yuks (laughs),Lots of excrement jokes. Funny if you're a kid or still one emotionally and/or mentally. Robin Williams with wife and charmless kids go on a vacation to Colorado. Lots of nonsense about how he can't handle the RV.Leave the Vacation movies to Chevy Chase and Randy Quade. You used to be so funny Robin. What happened?
2,TERRIBLE,THIS COULD OF BEEN A SUNDAY NIGHT MOVIE. CANNOT BELIEVE I PAID 16.00 FOR THIS DVD. I DID LAUGH ONE TIME. SEEMS LIKE THEY DIN'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN IT OR END IT. THE MIDDLE WASN'T MUCH BETTER. I USUALLY LIKE ALL OF ROBIN WILLIAMS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE WAS NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER MOVIES. SORRY. THINK IF I WOULD OF WATCHED THIS AT A MOVIE I WOULD OF WALKED OUT IN THE MIDDLE.
5,Very Funny.,Anyone who has had RV or experienced a first trip in RV can see the humor in this.Robin Williams always an incredible actor.
2,"""Mom, some idiot just parked this ugly RV outside our house.""","In RV, Jeff Daniels, who is a lifelong camping fan, plays banjo in every music scene.(Director cameo: Barry Sonnenfeld is recreational vehcle salesman, 'Irv'.)Here, Williams is an advertising exec who cancels his family's long-anticipated Hawaiian vacay, but he doesn't tell them that their Colorado trek in a motor home the kids sarcastically dub ""the big rolling turd"" is job-related.Typical ""hate dad at the beginning, love him at the end"" plot is somewhat enlivened by the countryish music of the story's Gornicke brood. It's mezza-mezz, however.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.5) RV (UK/Germany/USA-2006) - Robin Williams/Cheryl Hines/Jeff Daniels/Kristin Chenoweth/Chloe Sonnenfeld/Barry Sonnenfeld"
4,Great Family Movie,"I wathced this one with my kids. They loved it! This is not an intellectual thought provoking movie (and it wasn't inteded to be one). RV is simply a ""sit on the couch and enjoy"" type of movie. If you have kids, you will appreciate this movie. If not, you probably won't get alot of the humor in RV."
3,Not robin williams best by far,Well I think this movie was kind of a failuree for Robin Williams. It just wasn't that well scripted and the comedy was a bit weak in a lot of areas.It just seemed like the script was just lacking a lot! Robin williams is funny no matter what you put him in but he couldn't save this movie. Maybe they tried to hard to make something that was orginaly supposed to be a serious movie turned into a comedy. Regardles it just didn't do it for me.This is a one time rental kind of movie not something you want to have in your collection in my opinion.
4,My thoughts,"I have this movie , it has a thew good laughs in it , but thats about it , great for a family movie night ,I liked it . but it seemed to short ."
4,RV Bluray,I have the original DVD and wanted to get the Blu-ray version. It does have a better picture and sound quality. For those aspiring RVers this is the movie to watch. What happens to this family is funny but I am sure happens.
3,RV - family friendly with jr. high humor,"This is a pretty good family comedy. Robin William's character is trying to bond with his adolescent children. The kids are reluctant to spend time with mom and dad and the friction is realistic and funny. The Gornicke family is a bright spot. There are a lot of laughs, but be prepared to leave reality at the door because the writers obviously did just that. I personally have no problem with predictable endings, but this one felt a little tacked on.The casting was good and the characters worked well off each other. It could have been so much better with a little less gross-out/bathroom humor. If you're not a fan of poop jokes, you may not care for this one."
4,Funny,A must for any R.V er. Humor only a camper placed in this situation will understand and appreciate. Watch and enjoy!!
3,RV movie,Robin Williams was not at his best. Movie was funny and entertaining. Scenery was fun to watch as they traveled to Colorado.
4,funny,"This movie is really funny. It's about this family who was supposed to go on vacation to Hawaii, but instead Bob Munro (Robin Williams) rents a RV and takes the family to Colorado. What the family doesn't know is that this trip is for Bob's business. This film also stars the singer JoJo, as bitchy but loveable Cassie. Jeff Daniels plays Travis, the father to the annoying family, the Gornicke's, that the Munro's run into while RV'ing."
3,RV,"This movie had its moments of humor, but those moments of stupidity more than outnumber them. Robin Williams attempts to carry the movie but he falls a bit short (as he does in many of his recent endeavors). The plot is weak but the sheer farcity of it does give the viewer a chuckle or two. But for the most part this movie is a waste of time."
2,Too Much Green Screen!,"This movie was a bit lame for me. Robin Williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie, and the supporting cast wasn't much better, but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen. Even if this had been a good movie, the green screen was very distracting. I would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff."
1,I thought this would be a comedy,This movie just was not funny. Stunk. Horrible. The gags were all telegraphed and over the top. wasn't even silly...Just bad.
5,RV,Excellent and Funny movie that the whole family will love. Robin Williams is a riot and Jo Jo scartasim is on the money. Jeff Daniels as always a great and funny actor. Everybody should see this movie with their family. AAAAAAA++++++
4,"Entertaining, fresh approach to the dreadful family vacation","The large picture of this movie is probably missed by most folks. It is about a family who is in relative distress and them finding what makes a family a family again. The on the go, upper middle class family with spoiled kids, a trophy wife, and a workaholic father, sign of the times. Quite a bit different than the ""Vacation"" movies of chevy chase. Robin Williams was a great choice to pull this role off. Overall a very good movie, enjoyable, and I hope you like it to."
4,Great movie for the whole family!,"This movie is very well done and very funny! Robin Williams does a great job in the role of the father. If he didn't do his own stunts - it is great photography/stuntperson. He looks good! Jojo plays a brooding 15-year old, just crabby enough to get on your nerves without getting in your face! Well Done! Jeff Daniels was great in this part. This movie is good for everyone to watch from the Grandparents to the 8-year olds. This is a good movie to see in the theatres, and a MUST for the video collection!"
2,Depends on What You Want Out of It,"RV isn't a great movie. It will never win any awards for artistic merit, best acting or musical soundtrack. As far as family vacation movies go, Vacation with Chevy Chase was, by far, a better package. RV doesn't break any new ground in comedy or story-telling. It doesn't even really showcase Robin Williams like other movies have.However, if you are in the mood for some light-hearted mindlessness, RV will provide 99 minutes of that. The better character in this movie, in my opinion, was Jeff Daniels' Travis Gornicke. The story goes that the actors had to be trained in how to drive RVs - with the exception of Daniels. Apparently, he has his own RV and spends a fair amount of time in it.This movie has a cartoonish quality to it. The characters have a cartoonish quality to them, somewhat overplayed. So lower your expectations, and you may actually get a bit of a kick out of RV."
5,Funny Family Movie,"Another good Robin Williams movie. Funny as usual,but also just a good movie to sit and watch with the family. Liked it a lot."
3,Mildly amusing family comedy,"RV is a fun family movie that has sparse moments of hilarity, but as a whole is pretty flat. Robin Williams plays a workaholic who, rather than tell his family he has to work on their vacation, just lies and tricks them into thinking he wants to ride an RV across the country for family bonding time. In reality, he has a business meeting in Colorado, so he figures he'll kill two birds with one stone by making the trip with his family and working on his presentation while they sleep. This movie was okay, but has none of the hilarious moments from some of Williams' earlier family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Jumanji. In fact, most of the jokes seemed to be trying too hard. JoJo is pretty funny as his moody teenage daughter and Jeff Daniels shines as a redneck they meet in the RV camps along the way. Other than that, this movie is okay, but I wouldn't expect too much."
1,Insufferable....,"No wonder, if you have enough people like those, that some nerds like Bush could get elected and get the contry bankrupt and Americans being loathed and despised around the world... And anyone with crap in place of kids should be allowed to get rid of that : it would not be murder, only disposal of garbage. So sorry for Robin Williams, and for B. Sonnenfeld, the only explanation (there is no excuse) would be precocious senility. I especially regret waiting about 10 mns before stoping it (but,of course, I'm very patient)"
1,Terrable,"If I could give it a worse rating I would. I saw this movie in the theatres twice (don't ask why) and I regret I sat through that hour and a half of mind-numbing garbage every single day of my life. It is now true Robin Williams has gone insane, I mean you thought flubber was bad guess again this movie makes plan 9 look like lord of the rings."
3,family movie,I was glad to be surprised by this movie. It was better than what I thought. Robin Williams was great.
4,A Surprise,"I expected this movie to be a real side-splitter but it just didn't live up to that. It was a great movie, very funny, but Robbin Williams is the only decent acting in the whole movie. The family really doesn't match his character. I felt the movie needed something... but it was still pretty good. 4 Stars!"
2,Horrible waste for Robin Williams,"It hurt to see Robin Williams waste his talent on this horrible and unfunny rehash of Family Vacation.After 25 minutes wasted on humor surrounding sewage we simply said ""Enough already"" and hit EJECT"
5,"Once again, Milwaukee is the best.","You simply just cannot beat the quality of Milwaukee products. When they build a tool, it is the best tool in the category. Wish they would build a blower / mulcher like Toro and a mini-vac."
4,Great blades,"I received these is a very timely manor and was greatly surprised how they worked in the application that I was using them in. I have used other ""off branded"" blades which didn't do near as well as these have. For reference purposes I will never give a 5 star rating since that to me means perfection and we all have room to improve."
3,New blade design not as good,"I have used these blades for years in my construction business, and thought they were the best out there. But when I recieved these I noticed the teeth design was different. When I used them I could tell right away they didnt cut as well. Milwaukee should have left well enough alone."
4,sawzall blades,"the Milwaukee 48-00-5027 The AX 12-Inch, 5/8 TPI Super Sawzall Blade in the 5-Pack are a great blade and the product arrived on time"
3,NO LIGHT FOR ALARM FUNCTION,"This clock does not have a lighted alarm on function. It has a red painted indicator that switches back and forth according to the alarm on/off switch. If you like a lighted indicator for your alarm, pass on this one. It does have good radio sound."
4,"good, basic clock radio","The clock radio works reliably and FM and AM radio reception is very good. Sound quality is good, too. The only flaw is that there is no LED to indicate that the alarm is switched on. You will need to turn on the light and double check to make sure the alarm is on."
2,dustinj,This clock worked great for me for about 5 months. One morning in a sleepy haze while trying turn off the alarm I knocked the clock on the floor and now the digital dispay no longer works. It seams that an alarm clock should be able to take a little more than that.
1,Does not pull in a signal where I live,I don't know if this is because of where I live or if it's just not a good product but I wouldn't recommend it. It's basically useless to me as a radio. It's fine as an alarm clock but if you want a radio you'd better keep looking. My mother has the same model and hers doesn't get a good signal either.
3,Too Abridged,"This version of the story was a little too abridged for my taste, but I do appreciate it's durable board book format. My son (12 mo. when purchased) enjoys the pictures, and probably wouldn't grasp the story yet anyway. But don't order if you're hoping for a board book version of the classic you remember."
3,I knew I could is better!,"It's alright but I ordered, ""I knew I could"" and it's a better version. There are so many copies of this original classic out, you'll probably find it easily at any resale store or garage sale. I found a few copies at a resale store after I bought it. The updated version's story line and artwork is more appealing to my kids."
3,A little disappointed,I ordered this book to replace our copy that had been loved a bit too much. I was disappointed when I received it because the illustrations are not from the original story. We have a stuffed Little Blue Engine so it was a bit disappointing for my son.
2,Not what I thought I was getting!,"I have this exact same book as is pictured, it is not the book I recieved. I got a cardboard book. Nowhere in the description did it state that it was a cardboard book. I was very disappointed as this was a gift."
5,Classic,"This was my husband's favorite book as a child so we recently added it to our library. Our train loving nephew has an equal amount of adoration for The Little Engine. On our bike rides he'll often say ""I think I can, I think I can"" when we're going up a hill. It's a short book so if you haven't read it in a while don't expect anything Earth shattering, but it's a classic book that's worth another read."
5,great abridged version for the littlest readers,"my twin toddlers love this book - the train-shaped board book is interesting for them to explore with their little hands, and the story just long enough to hold thier attention"
3,Too long for kids,I think this story is for the older kids. Somehow it is too long for 3 or 6yrs old kids.
3,Clumsy Twist on the Classic,"This is the #1 stand out book from my childhood memories with my grandmother, so I was all too happy to buy a copy to share with my daughter. The story is great, the pictures are cute, but the wording is clumsy."
2,Feminist orientation?,"This book is beautifully illustrated and I enjoy looking at the pictures again and again with my son. Unfortunately, the text is cumbersome for younger readers and while I am not typically sensitive to type-casting and stereotyping, it seems as though this book is over-compensating for the male-orientation of past literature and society.The happy little train in the beginning of the book is female. Next comes the mean-spirited, high-browed Passenger Engine who is male, followed by the overly-important, too-busy-to-help Freight Train who is also male. Next comes the too-old, too-tired Rusty Old Engine who is male. Finally, the ""little engine that could"" arrives on the scene and she is female.The message my son comes away with is that he should seek women for help because men are too important or too busy to help and elderly can't help. The book continues to be one of his favorites so we look at the pictures and make-up the story."
2,Unnecessary gender sterotyping,"There is no Watty Piper. This, apparently, is a pseudonym used by the publishers Platt & Munk. The story has had sexist overtones since it was published in the early 20th century. It either paints men as unhelpful and selfish or women as the best assistants. Interestingly, adults polled about the gender of the star of the story typically say that it is male!Either way, I would hope that our society is evolving beyond this now. Subtle negative messages, such as violence in the Three Little Pigs and gender typing in this book, should be discouraged. We, as consumers, can assist in this by buying other books. In this case, there is no author whose feelings will be hurt - it's just a publishing company that is trying to milk this story for all it's worth. As one reviewer suggested, the train genders really should be removed (as in the early 20th century versions) or alternated. Simple, really."
5,WONDERFUL FULL SIZE BOOK,AN OLD FAVORITE I HAVE NOT SEEN IN YEARS. EASY TO USE AND TO READY TO YOUR CHILDREN. ENJOY FOR A VERY LONG TIME
5,The story that lasts through generations,One of my granddaughters favorite book. I loved it when I was a child. It really lasts! The illustrations are wonderful and hold her attention.
2,Where's the rest of the story?,"This will teach me not to read the reviews carefully before purchase. This is a very abridged version of the classic story: the bright shiny engine and the big strong engine are nowhere to be found. If you're after the book you remember from your childhood, find another version. The illustrations are bright & fun, but there's just too much missing from the story."
3,Abridged edition,"This is one of the great children's stories of all time. I loved it as a child and read it over and over again, and my son has been demanding it as a bedtime story regularly since he was2-1/2 years old. The 1991 Platt & Munk (a division of Grosset & Dunlap) edition, beautifully illustrated by Cristina Ong, leaves out all the requests made to the busy trains. The story is now very brief (which is why I give it only 3 stars instead of the 5 the full-length version deserves)--I suppose because it is a board book--but the essentials are all there. It also changes the sex of the engines from male to female, so perhaps some parents would like to read this edition to their children as well as one of the others."
3,Ok at first,"We've been using this machine in our office for about 3 and a half years. It does have some nice features, and we do very little faxing since most people prefer electronic documents. I guess the first year was ok, but at some point you could not send multi page faxes without a problem. Two pages would be pulled at a time, or paper jams that you have to start scanning all over and then another jam and start over again. This week one of the rollers came off. Currently we can receive faxes but not send."
4,Panasonic KX-FL545,"Great product this is the second one that I bought it's prety good for an small/home office. The transaction thru Amazon.com was very easy and went super smooth, Thumbs up"
2,The Definitive Version?,"The limited edition import (POCP-9207) is part of a Who 12 CD re-issue by Poyldor in Japan. For the new fan, this version includes a reproduction of the original LP artwork and poster. There is also a section from a Who discography that should be interest to all Who fans. (Yes, there are mistakes in it, so be careful.)Although the music hasn't aged as well as earlier Who efforts (for good reason: no Keith Moon and lots of Townshend ennui), there is always something worthwhile to hear in any collection of Townshend songs. That said, the real reason for getting this particular release is to complete one's set of Japanese re-issues."
3,Worst from The Who,"Not only the worst album The Who recorded, it's a bad album coming from any group. Surely the sound is very good and clean, but the songs (exceptions there are) are so dull. Yes, Pete's songs are dull! But John provided two excellent songs, ""You"" and ""The Quiet One"", among the best of The Who, and that's why I am giving it three stars. In the revised edition, there are things such as ""It's in you"" that would make the album even worse, if it wasn't for the great live versions of ""How can you do it alone"" and ""The quiet one"" plus ""Somebody saved me"". If you want the latter days Who, ""It's hard"" is the one to get."
2,Imposters Produce Whiniest of All Who Albums!,"Word has it that FACE DANCES was actually made by a completely different band than the guys behind WHO'S NEXT and LIVE AT LEEDS. Some suggest that A Flock of Seagulls are actually the ones playing these goofy pop ditties as practice for their own storming of the charts. Really, how did this thing make it out the door? On the heels of all the galvanizing music made by the Clash and others, the Who comes back with, ""When I say I love you, you say you better!""???? Bizarre."
1,definitely their worst studio album,"There are 2 good songs on this album - ""you better you bet"" and ""dont let go the coat"". ""Quiet One"" is also OK. This is one of those albums that I never play in its entirety. Thankfully with CD players I can program in the above 3 songs and not have to listen to all the poor stuff on the rest of the album.Anyone who says that this is a good Who album obviously doesnt get the real Who music that was made, the sixties stuff, Who sell out, whos next etc. With this album it is clear that Townshend is saving his best material for his solo albums."
2,"Not God-Awful, but not good either.","Pete Townshend can write great songs, and these aren't bad. But the only reason to buy this album is to help complete your WHO collection. The only really good song is ""You Better You Bet"". So unless you are a hardcore WHO fan (like myself) and need to complete your collection, buy something from their earlier days. I recommend ""Who's Next"" if you want their best...then go from there!"
4,Top of the Pops,"With a return to the 1960s pop sound, the band delivered a classic - You Better You Bet - while working within a framework to allow drummer Kenney Jones to shine.Daily Records, Don't Let Go the Coat and Another Tricky Day have very appealing hooks, with Cache Cache paced by a bouncy beat. The all-out rocker is John Entwistle's The Quiet One, with How Can You Do It Alone delivering an edginess through Roger Daltrey's lyrical interpretation.Peaking at #4 on the U.S. album chart, this March 1981 release is bolstered by five bonus tracks. The album demonstrates the art in crafting quality pop music and is an oftentimes overlooked gem in the band's amazing catalog."
3,Underrated,"Not a Who classic by any means but still has worthwhile music. Pete should not have divided time between the Who and his solo career at this point because it diluted his output. Nonetheless, there are some good songs on here as well as bonus tracks. Keith has been gone almost 20 years now and we still miss him."
5,Finally in CD format,"I had this disc in cassette format and I loved it. Finally I found it in CD format. This music never gets old, it is never unfashionable. Pop-rock in its most pure style."
3,"Good, but not by The Who's standards","The Who is one of, if not, the greatest band of all time. I think, however, that Pete Townshend's perpetual identity crises finally got the best of him here. The Who By Numbers was a beautifully done self-analysis, but by Face Dances, it seems that Pete was just trying to keep from becoming antequated, and in doing so, abandoned much of the style that made the Who truly great. Let's face it: the early 1980s was not a good time to adapt to the popular style. I would recommend this album to any Who fan, but can only say that it is certainly a far cry from the golden age of Sell Out through By Numbers."
2,Could have been _much_ better,"The four new songs on the soundtrack to the film _Quadrophenia_ foreshadowed what this album would sound like--light and poppish and nothing to do with the ambitious thunder of old. ""You Better, You Bet"" is charming, and ""Another Tricky Day"" sounds like it could have fitted in on _Odds and Sods_, alongside ""Long Live Rock"". The rest of it is just forgettable. It isn't Kenny Jones' fault; Pete's heart just wasn't in it anymore. Though maybe it would have been wiser to hire drummers on a song-by-song basis, like the Stones have done to replace Bill Wyman. Townshend should have foisted a _Scoop_ album on Atco to fulfill his contract with them, and saved _Empty Glass_ to combine with the best bits of _Faces Dances_. Definitely not the place for the new Who fan to start."
3,"The Who's stinker, but still a few tracks shine","""Face Dances"" is hardly anything that we would expect from ""The Who"", yet after losing Keith Moon, and bringing their rock to a new decade, one would imagine that it would be a total failure, its not, but its still the worst Who album, in my opinion. There are a few tracks that stand out, which make it average, but that is about it. This is nothing special, but grab it if you want to add it to your collection, just dont expect much...."
2,Not worth it,"There is no point in buying any Who albums from the 80's. Keith Moon is gone, and the fire that the band had together is no more. The Who are still the greatest band, but this was definitely not one of their greatest moments. Skip it."
2,There ain't no gems in here!,"Well, uhm, it happens to be true. Pete Townshend wrote some powerful, beautiful stuff for THE WHO BY NUMBERS. I wonder if anyone really understands how moving and how deep that numbers like ""Imagine a Man"" and ""They're All in Love"" really are? Well anyway, Pete goofed here big time, as did the rest of the band without Keith Moon as their drummer. Sad situation that was. There once was a band called the Who... So although they messed this up big time, there are of couple of funny (yet still pathetic) songs like ""Cache Cache"" and ""How can you Do it Alone?"" that justify its puny existence. It is sad and quite poignant that the Who had to break down like this, but check out their back catalogue for great material and you'll find that in reality they could have easily stood up to any of the world's greatest bands."
2,Downward Spiral,"With 64 reviews already registered there's not much more to add but to chime in that although devoted Who fans will consume just about anything the band does, this is a Who album you can readily ignore unless you have the rest of their catalog. A couple of decent songs here, with the rest of the album filler. I eventually sent my copy to the used bins."
2,Missed Opportunity,"At the time (1981), the Who could have delivered a good hard rock album, but missed the opportunity to show that they were still a force to be reckoned with in the studio. The songs were from Townshend's last good songwriting period (i.e. - ""Empty Glass""), but the arrangements were too light [i.e. - weak]. They seem more appropriate for an early 80's Genesis album rather than a Who album.I remember being glad they were still touring and making music in the early 80s, but looking back now, I wish they had called it quits after Moon died. ""Who Are You"" and ""The Kids Are Alright"" would have been respectable final statements for the band. At least better than this album and the one after it."
2,A very bad record,"Who'd have thought that the death of Keith Moon would result in the death of that sacred institution called ""A great Who album""? Obviously there are other reasons for the conspicuous absence of quality control on post-Moon albums but Moon's high energy drumming is sorely missed nonetheless. Pete, God love him, regressed significantly in the lyric department as is evidenced by the stupidity of ""Did You Take My Money"" and ""Cache Cache"". One gets the feeling Pete just doesnt care and that the songs he did contribute to the album (with the exception of ""You Better You Bet"", ""Another Tricky Day"" and ""Don't Let Go The Coat"") were rescued from the wastebasket. Very disappointing."
3,Sounds Better Now,"I remember buying this album while I was in college. I was a big Who fan, then, and I was really disappointed by the album. I used to have this old turntable, and I'd listen to the record at 45rpm instead of 33rpm, just to get some sort of energy off of it. The bass was really up front, in that first mix, and the drums sounded like they were following the beat instead of setting it. I just bought this cd a couple of months ago, and it doesn't soung like it did back then. It is actually listenable and, at times, pleasant. The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass is back where it belongs. The drums still sound off, but that may be the drummer. And, a couple of the songs are pretty weak...but, now that we can hear the songs that almost made the cut, I guess song selection was pretty thin, anyway."
2,"GREAT CINAMATOGRAPHY, HORRIBLE MUSIC!","AS I WATCHED THIS VIDEO, ONE THING BECAME APARENT. IT SEEMS THAT THE PRODUCERS COULD ONLY PROCURE THE RIGHTS TO ONLY ONE SONG FOR THIS VIDEO. IF YANNI TURNED ELECTRO-CELTIC, THATS WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE AS THE LONE TITLE DRONED THROUGH THIS PRODUCTION. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT VIDEO IF YOU MUTED THE SOUND AND TURNED ON SOME TRADITIONAL CELTIC MUSIC."
1,Which castles?,It would be nice to know which castles are featured in each of these videos. I would be more inclined to purchase one with that information.
2,Trouble,Bought as a gift - silly but appeals to the young (preschool). Probably would not buy again unless the kids asked for it.
4,A Dramatic Novel of Early Florida,"Contrary to the above (and only extant, at time of writing) review, this is a novel about the settling of early Florida and the Seminole Indian wars. I happen to actually remember reading THIS book, and know it was a very entertaining piece of pulp fiction, and had a tremendous amount of historical research, and humor to boot. One thing I recall in particular, a Mike Fink bullwhacker type who ran a trading post dousing his hairy chest with rum or moonshine to ""keep the little critters from peckin'"" him to death. No way is this a western, and in no way am I one of these self-made Amazon pundits, but the other ""review"" is wrong and a real disservice to potential readers of this worthwhile book."
5,The Best,The best. Just wish there were something that had come along since that would be as good. My copy is ragged but loved.
4,Interesting spy story,"I bought it thinking it was a mystery but the writer doesn't develop a suspensful story for most of the book. I would describe it as an interesting ""tale of a spy"" prior to the US entering World War Two."
3,You May Unfasten Your Seatbelts Now,"This is the type of book that you read once, having picked it up in an airport lounge and finished on a long ,or not that long a flight. Read it once and enjoy it, but you never have to go back to it, because there is nothing else there. A competent craftsman-like book much like one reviewer said, of the Ludlum-Follett school. I could also like to add Tom Clancy.No, this is not on the same level as a Le Carre, Cumming or Graham Greene, which do reward the reader with an additional reading. Nothing to get too excited about, static one dimensional characters and an interesting ending. That said, I may have given it two stars, if I have not purchased it as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99.No, I don't think that I shall be visiting this author again, unless I am stuck at a discount book store in an airport lounge."
3,Disappointing,"I've read a few William Boyd books and really enjoyed them, but found this one disappointing. I see it's been adapted for TV, maybe I missed something."
5,Restless,Restkess is not a new book and I don't know how I missed it!! It is truly exciting and full of unexpected twist and turns it. It spends equal time during WW2 and thirty years layer as a mother gradually reveals to her daughter her secret life as spy who has had to take on a new identity to avoid being killed by a traitor living in luxury and a perceived war hero which is far from the truth!!!
5,Best Book I've Read in a Long Time,"I found the life story of the main character (the mother) very interesting. It was hard to put down. Too bad the daughter was such a drippy, boring creature! But, that's how life is, sometimes."
4,A little long,Book starts out on the fast track but then gets bogged down into details which delay the storytelling.a good book as to what went on in WW2 but it could be more abbreciated and get to the heart of the story
4,Intriguing!,"I don't normally read 'sky"" novels but this one was a page turner for me. I like books that are, simply-put, a good story. This was that."
4,Excellent mother/daughter theme with WW II espionage,"""Restless"" was my introduction to William Boyd. I chose it because of the mother/daughter theme, which when done well, provides for rich doubling effect. Boyd made the women real, and the mother's story especially was compelling enough for me to finish the book in one read from 2 to 5 a.m. on a sleepless night. But, then again, I am a sucker for WWII espionage plots involving ordinary people."
4,Come on Amazon!,This was a very fun read but I cannot let this one go without commenting on the autrocious Kindle version. The thing was riddled with mistakes all over regarding spelling and puncuation. COME ON how hard can it be to trnasfer a digitial copy to a digital copy?!! Don't you kindle people review your product before selling it?? But worse is the publisher. If I was Boyd I'd be livid.
3,A Behind the scenes WWII thriller,"If you doln't like books that keep going back and forth from the present to the past, this is not for you. But it is an interesting look at what went on during World War II that most people were not familiar with. If you enjoy that kind of history, y ou will enjoy this."
4,Entertaining and thoughtful,This book was a delightful journey ... I enjoyed it immensely. I rated it 4 stars as I felt that the book ended without final resolution to some questions. But the overall story was a terrific read. I will read more of this author's books.
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This is the only William Boyd novel I've read...and I can't even claim that really as I didn't finish it!I persevered to page 109 purely because I hate giving up on a book, but decided I couldn't waste any more of my life on it. It took me over a week to get that far, so little did I want to pick it up, in contrast to books usually taking me two or three days to complete.Although the language is uncomplicated I found the characters confusing and boring and really didn't care about any of them. I hate being so negative about a book and maybe if I had have been able to get to the end it would have been worth it, but in my opinion a book should draw you in far quicker if it's worth reading."
2,Ho Hum,"Pretty basic spy novel, not particularly literary. I expected more from a Costa Novel Award winner."
4,Great story but TERRIBLE E-BOOK CONVERSION,"I highly recommend this book as a story (it is a 100% brilliant reworking of an old-fashioned spy thriller) but my enjoyment was undermined by the shockingly bad Kindle edition. It is filled with typographic horrors: sentences without fullstops; accents that turn into other characters (faade --> fagade); 'w' morphing into 'v/'; missing apostrophes; etc. It is appalling that the publisher thinks that this is acceptable. I don't mind some typos in a free book, but the e-edition of a book still in print from a professional publishing house (Bloomsbury) ought to mirror the 'real' book in every detail. This book has been converted so lazily that they've even left the paragraph at the end saying what font the [real] book is in. Lazy and sloppy."
4,"Fine book, almost great","This is a well written, finely crafted work of literary fiction in the form a a spy novel. As others have commented here, there are parallel running stories of mother and daughter. Mother was recruited as a spy while living in Paris in 1939. With training, her Russian emigre identity was effaced as she became a fully professional operative.Much of the action of the novel centers on Mother's encounter with her own past. What's missing is some deeper access to her interior life after WWII. How did she manage her complex identity--did she simply remain frozen? Had Mr. Boyd been able to open Sally's inner world, the novel would be even more impressive. It's still very much worth your time."
4,love it,This is one of the best books I've read in the last 12 months. The plot developed well and kept the reader's interest right up to the very end. READ IT!
4,restless,Prompted to reread this by the recent television production Middle is a little confusing but all is clear at the end. Boyd is a fine writer and the book is entertaining
3,Restless,"This is a ripping yarn, which I found difficult to put down and read at two sittings, but who on earth edited or proof-read the e-edition? I am not the world's greatest pedant, but the errors that were not filtered out defy belief and spoil the reading experience for anyone who is not totally indifferent to syntax, spelling, or punctuation. Mr Boyd, I will proof-read your babies for free if this is the best the 'professionals' can do for you."
4,Good entertaining,"I usually don't like spy or noir novels. But this one was cleverly elaborated. It is not Pulitzer, but nevertheless it is entertaining and you may want to give it a try, especially if you are looking to read something in the genre."
3,"Mr Boyd, where are you?","I HAD to read it. It is William Boyd, after all, one of my favorite authors.Many years ago, a friend told me I HAD to read News Confessions. And I did it : I took me away. Loved it. And advised other people to read it.Since then, I am still looking for the next Boyd masterpiece. The Nat Tate story was brilliant. Some others were sustaining. Is Confessions his masterpiece? Yes. What is Restless? A far cry from Confessions... It made me wait for those Boyd comments & twists. Interesting, enjoyable, but really not the best Boyd ever. There is no real punch in this one, just interest in going on to find out more about the Eva character.I'll stop here, Mr Boyd. I will still read you and wait for a new strong book like you are capable of."
5,A different spy story,"This is an amazing if complicated spy story. The viewpoint is of a young single mother who is struggling with finishing her Doctorate at Oxford. When her seemingly daffy mum starts giving her biographical chapters of her (mums) life, her perspective and understanding of her own life start to get twisted. And she gets involved ...I refuse to do spoilers as this story needs to be read to be really appreciated. I got it in Kindle format and it is one of the only books on Kindle which I felt the need to use 3M sticky notes on pages for perspective points and some of the dialogue.I've recommended it to friends who enjoy WW II spy stories - ones which are the small moments which are both life and world changing and create a sense of reality.This is a great read - try it."
2,I felt the storyline was weak.,"I chose this due to the fact that it will be on TV, but I felt the writing was not up to the standards that I would expect, and the storyline was weak."
1,Not at all what I expected...,"If you are looking to make ""trick photos"" and are new to PSP then this might be for you. If you are looking to use PSP to tweak and fine-tune, or even make drastic changes to improve pictures, this is not the book. It is more gimmicky than practical. There are much better books if you are serious about learning how to work with PSP. I was very disappointed with this book."
2,"Good concept, bad execution","I am a newbie at photoediting and was looking to learn how to use my new program. I liked the book's format, which is to learn by doing projects. However the author must assume the reader already knows the basics. He left out vital instructions and I was unable to complete most of the projects."
5,Paintshop Pro X Revealed,"I opened the book and never put it down. Excellent, I felt I was in a class-room. The downloads were perfect for using with the lessons. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick course in PSS-Pro X.The book opens a world of creative thinking. .Paulie"
4,Delightful!,"I bought Real Myst a few days ago and have been thoroughly enjoying it. Myst island is a delight. Standing on the beach watching the sunset over the heaving waves is a perfect stress-buster. I enjoyed the ambiance of night and the crickets chirping among the trees. I also chased the pair of butterflies all over the island (who's there to see me =) ). SPOILER- for those who've read the books there's an extra treat. Among the trees behind the cabin is the grave of Atrus' grandmother, accented with those little blue flowers that mean so much to him. I'm looking forward to exploring all the ages. Of course, the game isn't perfect. Moving about is jerky, rather like being drunk! The save/reload screen is difficult to use a mouse in though that might just be my computer. Despite these and other faults, those that loved the original Myst will enjoy this - if they're willing to burn the money needed to bring them up to the game's steep system requirements."
4,A nice way to revisit MYST.,"You can see all of the other reviews for the details. What I'll tell you is that if you didn't like MYST, there is no reason realMYST will change your mind. Despite a SERIOUS makeover, it's the same game.realMYST is for those of us who liked the original and want to revisit the game in a new way. The original Myst runs terribly on my newer machine. So even when I feel like playing it, even if to only walk around on the islands, it becoms a pain.This new version runs great. So if you have a machine that can handle it (by now you prob. do)and liked MYST, I would suggest you get this game ."
2,This game should run smoother,"I am an avid Myst/Riven/MystIII fan. I bought realMyst to see the advanced graphics added to it..ie: Day,Night,Rain,Sun,and special effects. The game is really choppy. I even advanced my system, but it didnt help. I believe you shouldnt have to go any kind of frustration when playing a game and this one had a lot of choppiness and delayed reactions even after I upgraded my system. Too frustrating."
3,Better off Waiting for the price to go down.,"I bought real Myst for $... having been drawn in by the amazing graphics and simplicity of gameplay. It was fun and the graphics were amazing. I stayed up late playing it a few nights. The only problem is that it doesn't last long enough to get your moneys worth. A game that is $... and up should have a lot of gameplay, and while this takes a bit of time to beat it should take more. Wait a year or two to buy it and see if the price goes down, or borrow it from a friend."
2,Real Myst or Real Boring?,"Captivating the audience with graphics is about all this game is worth. Waste your time figuring out trite puzzles that are about as challenging as learning to count to 10. It gets two stars for graphics. If your looking for eye candy and to throw away 30 dollars, Real Myst is for you."
1,"Its pretty, Big Deal...","Yes, the graphics are very good but the game is akin to an interactive painting. And so what about the graphics? Whoopee, most games have good graphics nowadays too but GOOD games have some meat to them. RealMyst does not; it's a very bland game for people who don't like real gaming experiences.After fifty minutes of looking at the pretty pictures, I was bored to tears and began the uninstall procedure. Phooey!"
5,Beautiful Nostalgia,"The first thing that should concern you before you buy this game is whether your system can handle running this game. I have an Athlon 800 mhz, 128 megs of ram and a Voodoo 5 and realMYST runs well with these specs, though it's noticeably choppy outdoors. That aside this game should stun you with it's depth. If you remember how it felt to see the original MYST for the first time, I'm telling you that you can have that and more with this new release. I recommend this game on mood and characterization alone because now that I'm older I find the puzzle aspect of the game too simple. A minor complaint would be that you can't reverse the mouse control, but you'll get over that quick."
4,BUYING TIP!!!,"This game was a lot of fun but a little short compared to the other Myst games. Riven is perhaps the best of the Myst series but I have yet to play Revelation. You can buy this game new and cheaper just about anywhere. And if you still have no luck, try Ebay. This game also works for Windows XP!!! Some people have had a little trouble with it but just make sure you download the patch which can be found at ubisoft.com. I played RealMyst on XP with no trouble. Good luck and ENJOY!"
3,It's Like Having Road Rage!!,"Let go of my mouse and let me turn! I pointed staight at the object and went forward only to run into the door jamb. I have been a MYST fanatic since inception. I had already bought 4 MYST games and Riven when I bought the RealMYST since I had just bought a new system. I am so disappointed. It is so difficult to get around in that it detracts from the beauty of the new game. I'll always love MYST - (I still have my other 4 games) - and I hope that EXILE, if in 3D, is a lot easier to get around in."
5,A Blast,This is one of the best games I have ever played! It is so much better than the Myst Masterpiece Edition. I recomend people who don't have Myst yet to get this instead of the Myst Masterpiece Edition. They will probably like it better. Thank you Cyan for making such an amazing game!
5,In a word... Talent,"Oddateee is a far cry from your cookie cutter hip hop Artists... His mixture of mesmerizing beats and poetry set him apart. If you're looking for something Fresh, BUY THIS ALBUM... you wont be sorry."
3,Accurate adaptation of a weak novel,"This is a film adaptation of Jaime Bayly's most notorious novel, directed by one of Latin America's most prestigious directors. Unfortunately, the material itself is weak, dealing as it does with the spoiled lives of the Peruvian upper classes (Bayly is a Vargas Llosa wannabe). As a result, the characters do not evoke either sympathy nor empathy--particularly the protagonist, played rather innefectively by Santiago Magill (I hated his long hair). However, the premise happens to be culturally on target: in Perú--as in most of Latin America-- it does not matter if you fool aside with men as long as you pass off as straight--meaning a wife, kids, and macho behavior. Thus, as a culture exposé and critique, the film is right on target."
4,Mood Enhancer Music,I love Bossa Nova music. It's relaxing and mood enhancer. Although I do not understand the lyrics I enjoy the soothing and sensual sounds. It transports me to another time and another place.
1,Where Is It????,"I would love to review this item...IF I HAD IT! C'mon guys, your departments aren't talking to each other. Thanks anyway."
4,Sharp Microwave oven,"This is our first microwave upgrade in many years. We are very pleased with the size, style, and options offered by this microwave. We read previous reviews which said they thought the unit was somewhat noisy but we have not experienced that yet, as I would say that this unit is actually quieter than our old one. Cooking/heating time is reduced and we have been extremely happy with our purchase."
5,Great product,This was my replacement microwave and was looking for sharp microwave with better price. Finally found this one. Previously owned a sharp microwave also for 12 years. This product is great.
3,"Interesting, but sometimes slow","The book is an interesting story - the author goes to Russia to work in the times of Stalin. He discusses the differences between foreigners and the Russians, the shortages of supplies, the problems of production, and the purges and some of their affects. As a foreigner, he feels somewhat distant from the times, and hence does not pull the reader in as much as one would like. The book drags with constant statistics of production, but overall is interesting as an introduction into the times. His comparison of standards of living in Europe to those of Russia are particularly interesting."
4,Excellent history,"I am glad I read this book, it gives an excellent, unbiased history of living in harsh conditions and working hard inside of Stalinist Russia. Clear and detailed but never pedantic. It only lacks an insightful view into the inner lives of those who surrounded the author. Understandable since the author was quite young and those around him needed to be careful of what they were saying. The primary focus is on the work at hand. It kept my interest throughout."
4,Stalin's Impact,"A very good account of life in 1930s Russia under the Bolshevik regime led by Lenin and then Stalin. Stalin's policies of collectivism of agriculture and rapid industrialization is very apparent throughout the book. What stands out is the dim view held by many Russian citizens of the capitalistic society of western nations including the United States which is clearly exploited by Stalin to pursue his objectives of social engineering and absolute power. You even find yourself buying into Stalin's propoganda as seems to be the case with the author, John Scott. But Stalin's brutal tactics must not be overlooked. He does create impressive cities and a very strong army, but at a great cost to the Russian people."
3,An Interesting Look,"John Scott gives us the reader an interesting point of view of Stalin's Soviet Union. His epic journey is not one to bew taken lkightly. He was in an era when disillusionment was high -- the Great Depression and he believed in the fream of work, even in the figid vastlands of the Urals. Scott gives a good account of what wlife was like, but the book goes by either very quickly or very slowly and does not capture a medium of speed that is accpetable to some readers. However, it is a brittlant account of first hand experence if you are looking for suh an account, Scott is your man."
1,VERY UNHAPPY!!,"The reason I ordered this set was because I wanted Deep Blue Sea and Sphere-- well guess what, when my package arrived it ONLY included Deep Blue Sea and Perfect Storm-- I was not a happy camper. Contacted Amazon and they are going to issue a refund -- but I didn't want the refund I wanted my movie!"
2,PEARL had the chops but should've hired songwriters,"This album is somewhat ahead of its time. The mainstream R&B and pop that you hear today can be heard on PEARL's 2001 outfit here. She's somewhat of a future predictor (although it didn't work for her, here), ""Love Trip"" the album is everything in a pop/R&B album musically and vocally but when it comes down to the lyrics (she co-wrote or wrote all songs), when this could be an awesome independent release, the lyrics fail to move ya and we fall (hard as hell) on this ""Love Trip"" PEARL issued."
3,"Very nice sleek cover, but clunky belt clip attachment","I ordered the pink one for my daughter's Zen sleek. It fits like a glove and looks great. However, there are two issues with it:1. It has a large metal button on the back for an included large black belt clip. There is also a lanyard, but it attaches to the belt clip. The FlexiSkin is great, but the beltclip is clunky and ugly. Better not to use the belt clip (but, of course, you'll make up your own mind).2. Zen Sleek will not fit into the docking station with the FlexiSkin in place. It is necessary to pull up the bottom of the FlexiSkin to use the docking station. Since the Zen Sleek fits so snugly into the dock, there is no cover out there that will overcome this problem. Not a huge deal as long as constantly stretching the FlexiSkin off and on won't stretch out its shape. If you use the interface cord array included with the Zen Sleek and don't use the optional docking station, this fit won't be a problem."
2,Disappointed.,"Ernie Kovacs was, of course, a genius. We all know that. However, although most of the individual bits on this tape are funny, overall it seems to have been very haphazardly thrown together, lurching from one bit to another without any flow. Also, Ernie had an annoying habit of taking a funny idea and beating it to death, such as the Indian trying to shoot his arrow and weird things constantly happening. It's funny the first time, but by the 8th time or so I was waving the white flag. This tape and the other tapes in this series need to be better organized and put into historical context. And please, lose Jack Lemmon's rather idiotic introductory statements. They drown Ernie out."
1,Terrible distortion check out the picture.,This lens does zoom but has terrible barrel distortion. Check out my side by side pic in the customer pictures section.
1,You will regret,"I've got this brand of a similar phone that is also a 2.4 cordless phone with similar features for a year.A month ago, the screen of the phone can't display correctly.Now, it didn't work any, as the battery seem can't be charged anymore.If you think a year life of a phone is worth enough to get, no problem and go ahead.anyway, the least good news for me is I know I will buy a new one but never tough in this brand anymore."
1,same problems,These phones have been a problem from the beginning. The caller id screens have or are disappearing. Do not buy these phones unless you enjoy problems.
4,Great buy for the price,"This is such a great product. I bought it for my 4 month old daughter and she loves it. It doesn't have any lights or music, but $40 vs. $100 I don't think it would be that big of a deal. It was relatively easy to put together ... however I did need help from my neighbor with getting the bottom portion of the legs to snap in properly. Other than that it was easy to put this item together. There were only two screws that needed to be put in for the lock on the seat. Everything else was basically just snap-ins."
4,Kind of girly,This item lost one star because of lack of instruction when putting together. If you take some time and think about it though you can get it togehter. The instructions need to be rewritten though. I did buy this for my son and it's pretty girly but he likes it and the colors are unisex. It's just flower themed. I would have bought the circus one for him instead if it had been in stock. Otherwise it seems pretty sturdy and once put together moves well.
4,Great fun for my son!,"My 5-month old son started using this toy about a month ago. It took him a few days to figure it out, but now he really enjoys it. He loves the toys on it and gets so excited spinning around in the seat and kicking his legs! My only complaint is that it took a while to assemble. Also, I haven't be able to get one of the toys on (the one with the bar)."
4,Evenflo ExerSaucer Delux - Wild Thing,Good item for the price. It was fairly easy to put together. My daughter loves the toys!
3,a so so purchase,"I bought this stuff about a month ago. It has'nt been used frequently. My son is not very interested in it but if you put him in he'll stay there for about 20 min. So I guess it's still useful if you really need a short break from your baby. Now he's 6 months old and about 27.5 inch. I feel the design of the seat is not very good. When I put my baby in, he tends to lean forward a lot. I guess it is partly because my baby can not sit very well. Maybe when he grows a bit older and can sit and stand well, he will fully enjoy the Exersaucer."
4,Pleasantly surprised,Very easy process to order and was shipped very quickly. This is what I wanted and the new baby will love it when she arrives. Thanks and I will use Amazon again for more baby items.
5,activity center,"Evenflo Exersaucer Deluxe-Wild Thing is a very well made product, a little confusing to put together, but is very durable. Shipment of the product was very very fast."
5,Great Exersaucer,The exersaucer is great. There is a great variety of toys which keeps my little one and niece both entertained. The younger babies love the lady bug on the long bendable piece. All ages love the mirror and the older ones love the rattles and moveable pieces. It is easy to adjust to the height of the child which helps when your family has lots of little ones like mine.
4,MAKE SURE THE LEGS ARE ON CORRECTLY!,"When this arrived, I put it together (though I did find it difficult - the legs mainly) in about 25 minutes. I put my 4 month-old in it and she was just so happy! She loved it - and then it collapsed with her in it. She was fine because I was sitting there with her, but had I stepped away, I'm not sure she would have been ok. The instructions don't tell you that the legs that attach to the base have to be put in and then twisted, and that it is incredibly difficult to do!! My husband is an Engineer, and can put anything together and it took him over an hour and a half to get the legs in properly. It is super sturdy now that they're in, and my daughter loves it. She loves the toys and is bouncing and turning it."
3,Good not Great,I have the expensive version of this evenflow excersaucer and my son loves it. I wanted to but the less expensive version for his babysitter's house. The price for this one is great. The problem is the toys are a little cheapy looking and in less than one day my son practically broke it as one of the parts unhinged. We have to keep putting it back together since my sons lovejumping and spinning in it. It definitely is not as sturdy as the expensive evenflow one. I say go for the more expensive ones. They are definitely worth the price.
4,Evenfow saucer,Well placed and simple saucer for child. Easy to use and easy to handle for kids. My kid enjoys playing and seating in it.
5,My very active Grandson,"My nine month old Grandson is not one to just stay put and play with his toys, so I needed some place to corral him safely and entertainingly while I fixed lunch, etc, or even just to give my arms a break. So I got this exerSaucer for him. He loves it. He jumps like crazy and turns around and around, going from one toy to the next. I would highly recommend this, especially if your child still needs your constant support to sit up safely."
1,Unsafe item!!!,"This is a very unsafe item. The legs do not fit properly into the base, causing the exersaucer to fall apart at any given moment. If I had not been standing within arm's reach of my daughter, she would have gotten hurt when the exersaucer collapsed with her in it. She is only 5 months old and definitely not over the weight limit! This item should be pulled from the market!"
5,Silent Movie,"This movie was really great, because it gave you something to look at, instead of listening. I had never seen any of VistaVideos' before Muscles in Paradise. It concentrates on one person, with many different views and shots. The movie got a little repititious at times, but all in all it was great and entertaining. Also check out all of the other movies in the series."
4,Sort of GOOD Life,"Glossed over some years quickly but on the whole entertaining. Do I believe the Russian roulette episode, I don't know but then again Greene was one of the foremost novelists of the last century. recommend all of his books as they are true fiction best on real life."
5,Ace is King,"As the album that launched his solo career, I have nothing but great things to say about this album. It has songs that describe his life-changing accident (Rock Soldiers), a song about the streets of L.A. (Into the Night) and many other great songs. This album is a must-have for any fan of good old 80s rock/metal."
5,frehley's comet first sighting,"gave this 5 stars based completely on the 7 ace songs on this release , the other 3 are not bad and they are not any ballads on this like second sighting."
4,"Ace's debut was outstanding, a great rock album!","I remember very well when ""Frehley's Comet"" came out back in 1987. I loved it then but it is just not a five star release because Tod Howarth sings on three songs, his voice being too thin and commercial to my ears. A shame that was overlooked then.As for Ace, he is in great shape, sings well and his solos are bloody amazing. I particularly dig the one on We Got Your Rock! How can he rock like that??? Supreme.The songs are also strong with a very good production work by Eddie Kramer. Eddie and Ace had worked together on a few great Kiss albums - Rock and Roll Over, Love Gun, Alive II - and on Ace's first solo album in 1978. What they can do together is impressive: on Frehley's Comet's debut album, songs like Rock Soldiers, We Got Your Rock, Strange In A Strange Land, Fractured II and even Into The Night are true keepers."
4,Great CD from a member of KISS,"After he got kicked out of KISS or left KISS however you want to see it, Ace went on his own....This album/CD is great if you are into the 80's Music... Yes it does have Anton Fig (of Letterman Band) Overall, not too bad of an album/CD for a member who was and is now back in KISS......Sorry Vinny Vincent. But you still Suck.....Rock Soldiers, and Into the Night are by far the best songs on the recording.......ROCK ON......."
3,Ace is doing his thing here...,"...whether it was a good idea, I dunno: almost typical 80's rock that simply is too dated for anyone but extreme fans of 80s guitar-glam rock. BUT, you must respect ACE for being himself here (80s sound taken into account) and not following trends as much as his counterparts in KISS have done (I dont remember Ace and band wearing overly colorful clothes and doing the femm'ed out make-up thing). My main gripe though is this one track, CALLING TO YOU, sounds alot like the band 707's theme for the movie MEGAFORCE (scary...). All in all, a good 80s rock and roll album. Not the impact that his replacement's band (Vinnie Vincent's Invasion) had but also not as flashy (then again, that band ditched Vinnie and made millions as SLAUGHTER)."
3,Frehley's Comet,Hadn't heard this in years. Wasn't quite all I remembered it to be back in high school. The lyrics seemed a little cheesy now that I've become a cynical adult.
3,Has Some Good Energy And Moments,"I've owned the cassette of this release for a few years. On the whole, it's not too original, but it does have some moments. ""Into the Night"" is pretty cool, along with ""Calling to You"" and the impressive instrumental ""Fractured Too."" The production is pretty good also. Not the greatest release, but not too bad either."
4,Ace First solo After Leaving Kiss,"This album has some realy good songs on it.But if you ever bought an album for just one song,then Rock Soldiers is it.That song is the best song Ace ever did and is a classic in my opinion.Just hits the spot and his lead guitar in it is awsome.Mind you there is some other good songs here, Tod Howarth did share vocals and did a fine job with his contributions.Actually there is no bad songs here.Except i dont know why he kept attempting remakes of Fractured Mirror."
5,Japanese garden,"You will find inside a lot of inspiration on how to make things work. Exceptional ""do it yourself"" recommendations. Its a real guidebook for japanese gardening lovers."
4,Japanese Gardening in Small Spaces by Isao Yoshikawa,A lovely book about Japanese gardens that everyone can imitate if they enjoy this type of garden. I have always been fascinated with the Japanese type garden and have styled our back garden after the Japanese details in this book.
2,Very Disappointed,"I don't know what people consider small space but this book doesnt't cover it. My rooms are 11x13 with no flat walls. The illustrations aren't expanded enough to get a real sense of the rooms and what I saw didn't excite me. And, the ideas are really old, if you have access to HGTV watch it for better ideas. Not worth my money and sorry I brought it."
1,Bill,The split design of the spit is very weak. When assimbling the spit rod (2 Pieces) the thredded end broke off before it was even seated. Amazons return policy is good. They supplied me with a postage label for the return.
3,Not universal. Electrical cord is only several inches long.,"The Char-Broil Rotisserie did not fit my new Char-Broil grill. Before ordering, first call Char-Broil to see if this unit will fit your BBQ unit.Be aware that the electrical cord is only several inches long. You will need an extension cord."
1,Not to satisfied :-(,I was very diisappointed with this product since I used it twice before it snapped in half. Im going to try and return it for a new one. Hopefully the next one will last!
1,Spit Bar Too Long/Poor Design,"The spit bar comes in two pieces and must be screwed together. This is a weak joint and you cannot make it tight without breaking the screw completely off in the other bar. Poor design, weak design. Also, the ""competed"" bar is much too long for my Char-Broil two burner grill. In fact, almost a foot too long! This is the Rotisserie that Char-Broil recommended on their web site for this grill. Looks like I will have to cut the bar to a usable length. Disappointed in this Char-Broil Deluxe Electric Rotisserie!!"
1,Poorly Made - Lack of QC?,"I was excited for this item to arrive, but unfortunately the threads on the rotisserie rod were badly marred and stripped. Horrible disappointment... Returned for refund ~ Thank amazon."
2,"Waiting and waiting, over 3 mos. now","It has been over 3 months, and I am still waiting for Amazon to be able to deliver this product. They continue to give a shipping estimate, than continue to extend the delivery estimate another month. Has happened 3 times now. Originally ordered early august and still do not have the product."
4,"Despite flaws and uneven quality, I found it enjoyable","This 2001 Canadian art film is composed of several short stories which all take place in the same hotel room over the last century. Century Hotel is a low budget film and a good platform for aspiring actors, most of whom were unknown to me with the exception of Mia Kushner who I recognize as the character who plays Jenny on ""The L Word"".Some of the stories work. Some don't. And the quality of the acting is mixed. The stories are not interrelated but yet we see them in pieces which make the concept rather interesting. Also, the many romantic scenes all display an abundance of flesh and there are many surprises in the twists and turns of the plots. There are definitely flaws in the production however and some of the stories are quite unbelievable.I can't help it though. I enjoyed this film immensely and couldn't stop watching. I therefore give it a mild recommendation just because it held my interest."
4,Inter-twined,This movie I saw back at least 5 years ago. I was enthrolled by the plot line and I've seen the movie at least 6 times. The way that all stories end up looping back to one another and makes the story whole. There were many amazing performances within this film and I recommend it to anyone who likes to figure out the plot line before it happens.
4,"An interesting, quircky movie","Century Hotel is a movie about a hotel room, and seven stories about the people who have stayed in Room 720 over nearly a century. The writers and director made conscious decisions about the cinematic styles for each era, and even though none of the stories was very long by necessity, they brought the moment into the light and gave you enough for you to hang your imagination on. They went for edgy and succeeded in some ways with stories about love, betrayal, beginnings and endings. The stories are told through the characters' actions and dialog, and you're allowed to draw your own conclusions about what went on after.I liked Century Hotel, it was a fine freshman effort that came in under $750,000. The DVD is nicely done, with a commentary track that is a tiny bit pretentious, but overall they do have a few things to say about the film. The short ""Moon Palace"" was worth the cost of the DVD."
2,Nailpolish,DIdn't look like Hologram polish on my nails. Wouldn't order it again. I was disappointed in the product. At leasrt it wasn 't expensive.
2,Not what I thought,"Maybe I didn't read the product description thoroughly, but I assumed it would be a clear coat that can either be worn alone or on top of another color and would give a holographic illusion. Its more like a glitter polish and the hologram isn't very good."
1,Worst Economics Book Ever...,"I personally had the honor to take Professor Dale Truett's class in managerial economics. Although Dr. Truett knows far more than the average scholar of economics, it is best he sticks to the real thing, rather than trying to write a book about it. It is one of the hardest texts I have ever had to read..."
1,Hard to understand; Worst Economics textbook ever,I teach college-level economics and this is the hardest textbook for students to understand. Most of my students do not like this textbook at all. It's explanations are very complex and the graphs are worse. Do not buy this textbook! There are so many more Economic textbooks on the market that are better than this one.
5,Great for hydroponic reservoirs,"I use these in the 3 and 4 ft sizes to provide max oxygenation to my hydroponic reservoirs, works much better than standard air stones."
4,"Not cheap, but works great!",The only reason I would give this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because of it's price tag. That being said it works great. We use it for tennis rackets and bats as well as baseball gloves. The entire Fast Track system is great and this is no exception!
5,hard to find product at great price,"I had been searching for panoramic photo albums everywhere and finally found them online. These are attractive and very inexpensive. Not a complaint, but they do come in a variety of colors and you don't get to choose which you get."
5,Great Tool and Reference for Cookbook Writers,If you are serious about writing cookbooks then this little book will be of great benefit. It will give you the professional confidence instrution and inspiration that you need to proceed.
3,The Only Recording So Far...,"The good--Shirley Verrett has an ample and sultry dramatic mezzo-soprano/soprano voice and sings with endless feeling, color, and detail: a noble and gripping performance. Domingo nearly matches her with golden tone, dramatic insight, and unfailing musicality. Mittleman, Mandac, and the rest of the cast don't disgrace the stars but never reach their level either. Perisson doesn't let the music drag and conducts with verve. The bad--live performance values don't undermine the enjoyment of this set, but add little in the way of ensemble clarity from both singers and orchestra. The added electricity of stage singing (as opposed to studio conditions) is welcome but could be traded for better sonics. The ugly--Why hasn't this opera been commercially recorded? Surely Verrett and Domingo could have found time in their busy 1970's schedules to record parts they obviously own every note of. Another opera-recording-world mystery."
1,Impossible Password Journal,"(...)I had password journal for Christmas, I am very upset because it is impossible to programme, it doesnt recognise my voice or my commands. Basically is is useless."
4,cool toy,its the best toy in the world whoever dosnt buy itmust be mad i think age range should be 6-16 its so cool(...)
1,I wish i could give this 0 stars.,Anybody can open it all you have to do is hold down the password button!Password journal 3 is much better if you want a password journal get password journal 3.They should not have even made a toy. It should just be a journal not a password journal. Do not buy this toy! No I wish i could give this neightaive 10 (-10)!
1,What a waste of money!,"This toy was such a disappointment. My daughter had this at the top of her wish list. I got it for her for Christmas. I agree with everyone else that it is frustrating and impossible to program. If I could have rated this all zeros I would have. Don't waste your money. Right now all I want to do is try to return it without the packaging, which got throw out with the trash at Christmas. Otherwise the company will get an ear full."
2,Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought,My daugeter really wanted this for Christmas. She was so excited to get it. However 2 days after Christmas I believe she had rather gotten somthing else and throw this thing out the window. It would be a great toy if only it was not so hard for it to recognize your password. We have reset the thing atleast 5 times now. It would work great if it had a key pad or somthing for them to enter a number code. My daughter is more frustrated with it and I feel this will become a thing of the past and will end up at the bottom of her closet.
2,"so, so",my daughter bought this and was easily frustrated when the toy would not respond to her voice commands. slip once of the bed and it was the end of it. looks more fun than it actually is. waste of money
1,Like the other said - piece of junk,"Light doesn't work, password doesn't work, change time doesn't work, nothing works. Voice recognition *does not work*. Zero stars."
2,Not as fun as it appears,"I purchased this toy for my 8 year old daughter. She was very disappointed. She had a hard time getting it to accept her password & it would let anyone into it who spoke the password. It also would not work if our Grandfather clock was chiming, you had to be in a quiet place. Within the first 15 minutes, the front cover had came off. I was able to repair it, but you would hope for better quality from a $20 toy. I would not recommend this product."
1,Stinks!!,"I did not like this toy becuase, you can push the button down and it will open. also becuaze, all of the voice commands do work. I thoght it would be nice, but not at all, It's a surefire rip off. I am teling youto buy this toy"
1,I Hate this toy!!!,"This is the worst 23 dollars I've ever spent!! When I tried to set the date, it always said, May 33rd! I can't beleive they actually try to sell this. The company who made this thing probably will go out of business. Whatever you do, don't buy this toy. All you're going to do is return it. Just avoid it completely from the start!"
3,It has its downsides and upsides.,"I got this toy for Christmas, and well, it's OK. I was frustrated at first but it takes time and patience. Yes, you do have to use the same tone of voice and speak clearly. I find that my brother can't get in and that is a good thing. He wants one for himself he thinks it's so cool(too bad it says GirlTech on the front!) The paper though, is very cheap and came off as soon as I lifted the packet. It is now taped on in my Password Journal 4, but I don't mind. I can't say I recommend it, but I can't say avoid it. Despite the bad reviews, my mom bought it for me for Christmas and I think it's okay. Just keep this into consideration."
1,Disappointment,"This is a very bad product. The time/date and the light on/off command never worked for us. We took it back and got another one and the time/date and light on/off commands still didn't work! The password command worked most of the time, but it seemed that if the inflection in your voice wasn't just the same as the first time you recorded the word, it wouldn't open. Big disappointment."
1,Taken by the Toy,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas - what a fool I was. Look at the package, see the pen, see the cool stuff - yep - NOT IN THE PACKAGE! This made my daughter cry. Where was the pen that is so prodominately pictured EVERYWHERE on the package? Not in the package, but sold seperately! I ran out to buy it for her - CAN'T FIND IT! Again, like the others it is already at the bottom of the endless toy box.Don't buy it, it is a waste of money. I bought her an old fashion regular one with a fake lock set, she loved it. (...)."
1,The only thing secret is how to use the thing!,"Parents be warned! This is a big piece of junk and a huge rip-off. I think that the positive comments were written by employees of the manufacturer. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this toy a chance. Huge mistake! It does not recognize your voice, and when it does, it understands it as something totally different than what it said. My eight-year-old was very upset with the journal, and I felt very bad for that. You will regret buying this...believe me! Stay away and save your money~!"
2,No Comprende,"Im pretty convinced that this toy does not speak english. It was neary impossible to set the time and date - even to the point of frustration. I must have spoken the date into it 15 to 20 tines and it never got it 100% correct. And the process for date/time setting is pretty exhausting. However, my daughter thinks it is fun so what the heck."
4,Alexa's Journal!,"My 8TH YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS SO HAPPY TO HAVE RECEIVED THIS GIFT, SHE STATED IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST GIFT SHE RECEIVED... AND WAS VERY HAPPY AND EXCITIED--- ABOUT IT.JUST BECAUSE IT'S A PRIVATE PASSWORD JURANL AND NOT ONE CAN GET INTO IT BUT HER."
4,Fun product but requires a little patience,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I almost didn't get it because it had so many bad reviews. The one thing I can say about the bad reviews is that they actually helped me. I had no grand expectations of this product. I knew that I had to be patient with it. However, it did NOT take us hours to program it. It was only about 15 minutes and it is working beautifully. The only problem that we have is that it doesn't always recognize your voice. You have to speak the password exactly the same each time for the password to work. Other than that, we love it. My daughter is having a great time with it. She is nine years old which is a perfect age for this product. Very important though, make sure you have NEW batteries for best performance. Hope this helps. MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
1,Not worth buying this one!,My daughter bought this toy with her Christmas gift cards. It took us over an hour to set it up and it still did not work properly. What a disappointment to my daughter. She asked if we could return it and she could get something else. Frustrating toy for a young girl and her Mom.
2,fort knox journal,"The Password Journal works only for about 3 entries then you have to reset it. If you do not access it every 30 minutes or so it wont work. This is the second one that we have purchased because it was on ""Santa's"" list. The other one did the same thing and don't bother trying to get help from the company, it's a waste of time."
2,Made my daughter cry,"I bought this Password Journal 4 for my eight year old daughter. She was very excited, and I thought it was a good idea because it would encourage her to write.Problem 1) It was very difficult for her to program because you have to speak clearly, and slowly. That was very fustrating for her. Finally working with her, and showing her how to do it, we got it to accept all her ""Secret Codes"".Problem 2) You can't whisper to it, so it didn't take long for her brother to hear her, and learn her secret code.Problem 3) Even though it was so fickle about the way she spoke the secret code, it wasn't fickle at all about who entered it. Her brother's voice worked just as well to open it, and it turned out my deeper voice openned it too. I could say a word that was close to the original and it would open.My daughter tried using it by hiding it in her room, but she quickly lost interest in it, and now it's on the bottom of her toy box."
1,THIS IS A MEAN TOY FOR LITTLE GIRLS,"We bought this for our daughter last Christmas, and it was the worst toy we've ever given her. She recorded her pasword dozens and dozens of times, it NEVER would open. We just kept resetting the password, stii the same problem. She ended up using the voice button from her barbie walkie-talkie, and even then, it would only open some of the time. She got SO mad, frustrated, and upset. I felt horrible that I gave her such a crappy toy that upset her like that. It, like many others I'm sure, is living at the bottem of her cavernous toy box, never to be seen (or heard from!) again. Don't waste your money unless you enjoy that look of desperate frustration on your childs face"
4,another one of my reviews,"Hi im 13, and i wrote another review on this journal. One thing i forgot to mention that really bothers me about this journal is the space to keep your pens and pencils. What bothers me is that it is to short of a space to keep a gel pen, because you would have to keep a gel pen wiuthout the lid. Pencils dont work unless they are shorter and older. Because if you put in a new pencil, it wouldnt fit. And a nice cute little feather pen?? Nope, the feathers get squashed in the diagonal crossover. So what does fit in this journal???I dont know!!!Hey! Wait a minuite!!! I do know!!! The jam n' shread pen!!! By Girl Tech. This journals pen compartment was FORMED EXCATLY to fit that pen. But the pen itself costs $9.99! What kind of TOY pen costs 10 bucks! Not one that Im going to buy. Ok, thanks for reading and i hope this helps."
1,Big Disappointment,"This was number one on my 7 year old daughter's Christmas list. We were both really excited for her to try it. It was a huge disappointment. We could not get it to work. It became very frustratin for her, and me as well. We even took it back and exchanged it for another because we thought it was defective. We had the same problem with the second one, so we returned it and got our money back. My daughter was heart broken. Take my advise and spend your money on a nice diary with a lock."
1,Tara Sadr's Review,"Warnning: Do not buy this toy!I was looking for a diary and I tought a password journal is a good one. But it's not.This is why:1. It only has 30 small pages.2. If someone knows the password and speaks into it, it atoumaticly opens3. Setting the time and date was hard. If you are setting the date, it says: Febuary 58!This is the lesson I learned:Always check other peoples reviwes and see what they think before you get something.Luckey I could return it or I would have spended $23.00 for nothing.(Plus batteries and tax).p.s: I wish I could put none stars for this thing."
3,I guess its alright just a little frustrating........,"I got this journal for Christmas from my aunt. I changed the password then I closed it just to make sure it would work. I tried it a whole bunch but it never opened. I was also very upset that is DIDNT come with the Jam'n Shred Pen!! It is very frustrating that it will not open!! And in all the comericals and stuff the people were using the Jam'n Shred Pen, but it didnt come with it!!!!!! But otherwise it listens to all my other voice commands when I say like light. I just have to get it open fisrt!"
5,not that bad,"My cousin, my sister, and I liked it.My cousin did not like the first one which did not work one bit.The other ones and this are great!I do not recommend the first one but the others and this one i do.Just speak VERY clearly in a quiet room.Do NOT speak TOO loud so you can't be overheard.Don't say bad words because you just have to be patient.DON'T KILL YOURSELF TRYING! Or strain yourself.-Smart Alleck(V.I.P.)Just CCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!"
4,"It's good, except...","This is a fun journal to write in, because you don't have any lines on the paper, so it's easy to write OR draw.However, after a while, it starts opening by itself immediately after you push the button. When it does that, simply take the batteries out and put them back in, or replace them with new ones; and start all over. All your old journal entries should still be there. :)I recommend Journal 5 though, it has invisible ink that only shows when you use the light."
1,Voice Recognition is HORRIBLE,"I bought this for both of my girls and within moments of playing the voice recognition was giving them trouble. If there is the SLIGHTEST background noise, the recognition will not recognize the password and won't open. If the tone is not exactly the same as when the password is set, the voice recognition will not recognize and wont open. My daughters had to keep reseting the passwords, which defeats the purpose of the password protection. I say get the old fashion key and lock diary is better then this one."
1,Disappointed,"Wonderful idea, poorly executed. My 6 year old loved this Christmas present last year and still carries it around SCREAMING her password (princess) into it. Once every 100 times, it recognizes the password and opens."
1,"Boo, this stinks!","I agree with the others, this toy stinks. My friend's sister can get in it, even if she says the right password. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!,"This thing is such a piece of junk. My 9 year old daughter saved up her own money and bought this and was greatly disappointed. It took hours to ""program"" this thing and still never worked properly. Eventually, it got to the point where it wouldn't even close. Of course, it wouldn't matter because the thing only comes with about 10 pages to write on and it's glued to the back so the paper cannot be replaced. The quality of the product is really cheap as well. Don't waste your time learning the same lesson my daughter did."
2,"rarely works, hard to use","My 7 year old got this for her birthday and it had her in tears by the end of the night. It rarely recognizes the password, we're constantly resetting it. It has to be extremely quiet and you must yell to get it to open. Her little brother always knows her password and it will open for him as well. The light and date commands do not work.The concept was great and it sounded fun but it has been frustrating and disappointing for my child."
1,They just don't work!,"I just returned the second Electronic Journal that replaced the one my 10-yr-old daughter received for Christmas. They just don't work. They don't accept the passwords, or they don't accept the date/time, the light doesn't work ... A waste of money."
1,Yikes! Can't get it to work!,"I got this for my five year old for Christmas - wasn't the top of her list, thank goodness. We worked with it for a long time trying to get it to accept her password, and it would not. Finally, I tried it with my voice, and it worked. But I'm not the one who will be using it! It's like it is calibrated for an adult voice, and her squeaky little voice won't get it to work. The instructions say to try to whisper if it won't work using your regular voice - we haven't tried that because frankly she is tired of talking to it. You can operate it without a password but what fun is that?"
1,Buyer's Remorse!,"My daughter had seen this advertised on TV and it looked so cool to her. She insisted on getting it for a friend for her birthday, and I was so excited about getting it for her for Christmas. WHAT a disapointment! We recorded her password over and over, and she tried to open it over and over. It opened for her exactly once. I feel like pitching that toy through a window, and my daughter has abandoned it. How I wish I had the foresight to read these reviews before buying it. $25 dollars down the drain."
1,what a piece of junk!,"this thing frustrated me, my daughter and everyone else that tried to help her program it! it would not recognize any words that any of us spoke, we couldn't get it to accept a password code. buyer beware, stick with the old school lock and key journals."
2,Leaves me searching for more,"A review of hymnody very heavily weighted towards 19th and 20th-century protestantism. The 20 centuries of Western (Roman) hymnody is barely touched and the 20 centuries of Eastern (Orthodox) hymnody is virtually ignored. In contrast, comprehensive, contemporary choices for hymnody studies should include the Hymnal Companion to the Lutheran Book of Worship (Stulken) and The Hymnal 1982 Companion (Glover).My edition has some typesetting incongruity that makes it appear as though some of the hymn and tune selections were reproduced from other sources.If you're looking for a comprehensive study of Christian hymnody, you'll probably be disappointed with this choice."
1,Caveat emptor dudes,"This lens truly sucks eggs. The comedown is enormous the first time you put the lens on your camera and realize it don't really fit just right and your thinking "" this ain't going to cut it!"" And it doesn't even come close. It does make things bigger but you get better resolution looking through the bottom of a glass! I don't know what I was thinking giving this 1 star.!"
5,This book will double the impact of training.,"""This book will double the impact of training.

4,Never practice lawschool Armin!,"You should stick with what you're doing now. Mixing great albums, remixing good tunes and rocking the world as a deejay. This CD though only has a good A-side, the B-side is not that good. However the A-side makes more than good. Top tracks by the uber-talented James Holden and a remix of the loveparade classic techno stomper; Der Klang der Familie by Dr. Motte.Rush to the store to buy"
5,Wilwaukee is the best,"This arbor was bought to use with the 3"" carbide tipped Milwaukee hole saw. Both items held up through entire job without any problems and still going strong. Far better than competing brands."
5,great tool for my purposes,I needed a long shaft hole saw and bought this arbor to go with my drill extension. Now I won't have to take apart my other one. I expect it to be very useful. Thanks.
3,"Cool, but beware","The one I ordered turned out to be only a 5-inch globe, but I believe the base can support either 5"" or 7"" and the seller sent me the wrong one (they gave me my money back when I pointed out their mistake). It looks just like it does in the picture except that the bands of plasma move around and will follow your finger if you touch it. Hold a compact fluorescent bulb up to it and the electrical field will cause it to light up!The base is very cheap plastic and there was a small flaw in the glass globe of the one I got. It could be that can't be avoided when the globe is made. I was amazed that it runs off of a 12 volt AC adapter cord.The novelty will wear off soon, but it makes a nice partner to a lava lamp for about the same price."
2,"Good prose, bad erotica","While the author seems to be a more than competent writer, his stories are startlingly unerotic. If I hadn't been looking to get off while reading these, they would have been fine, but the build up is protracted without sustaining a nice erotic hum, and the climactic scenes are too short. Further, the stories are extremely repetitious. (Unsurprising, as this is a collection of stories previously published in disparate magazines.)However, it is well enough written that I might try reading something else he's written if it's not supposed to be erotica."
3,This is a very good band.,"This I beleive is a very good album. I rocked long an hard to this band all through the nineties. my only wish is that I could find ""Nobody said it was easy"" again after my copy was stolen. These guys had a feel that was completly different at the time which would now probably be lost in the shuffle. (again)"
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" FOR ANY ""FOUR HORSEMEN"" FAN","If you own their first CD ""Nobody Said It Was Easy"" then you NEED to get this disc. Unfortunately this is not the original band line-up. Nevertheless the original guitarist (Dave Lizmi) and the original singer (Frank Starr) are on this disc. The music is still Hard-Driving Rock and Heavy Metal and the ""Four Horsemen"" sound still comes through ""Loud and Clear"". Sadly this was to be the last album by this Band. There is a self-titled EP disc that the Band released BEFORE their ""Nobody Said It Was Easy"" CD. This is also a ""must have"" for any ""Four Horsemen"" fan. There are four songs on this disc. If you are lucky enough to own the ""Self-Titled"" disc and the ""Nobody Said It Was Easy"" disc then you will have ALL the songs by the Original Line-up. Sadly there are only 16 Songs by the original line-up but what GREAT SONGS they are !!!"
4,Talk about vocal harmonys! WOW!!! these guy can ROCK!,"Where can I get more info on these guys??? I am a web designer & would give my services to do a nice web page on the four horsemen! All I can dig up is pics on the 2 cd's.I would like to know more about there hard luck & bad times, The CD is definitly a must for your ROCK collection! If any one can help please get back to me"
4,Excellent,Excellent. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because it was out of the package when I received it and was just laying next to the container in the box.
5,Tiffen 812 Warming Filter,"This is a nice addition to any camera bag. Took 2 photos of my wife without the lens, and then 2 with the lens. Her skin tone with the filter is very nice and natural looking. I recommend this filter for any portrait shots, and maybe group shots."
2,"Very good , just little expensive.","Nice case for my P910i fits nice and easy. It turns on my camera flip on my phone every time i take out the phone from this case, may be this should get used to this case or the phone has to sit on it for sometime to stretch the case size.Waist Clip is really a poor design. For such a big & heavy phone, why did they design such a small clip?It is just little more expensive, 5$ to 8$ will be the right price for this anything more is expensive for this poor design."
5,Great sequel to Tommy's Clubhouse,"Tommy and the Spy Guys are back again. They have adventures building a rocket, searching for buried treasure and getting to know the new boy in the neighborhood. Tommy learns that being honest is more important than winning the history fair.Early elementary children will empathize with Tommy's problems and try to copy his adventures. My seven year old loves the book and so does the rest of the family.This book is also a wonderful read aloud book for a child who is not quite ready to tackle chapter books independently."
5,Best Book Ever about losing a pet,"While this book is obviously intended for children who have lost a pet cat, I found a great deal of comfort in it for me--an adult woman of ""a certain age"" whose beloved cat died recently. The author describes in vivid, heartbreaking detail the young boy, Victor's grief as well as his Mother's loving understanding and acceptance of his grief. It is simply a beautifully told story, with lovely illustrations. I highly recommend it for anyone whose pet cat has died. It would make a thoughtful gift to someone whose cat has recently died."
5,A profoundly compelling picture book about grief,"Flowing color paintings by Ronald Himler add a moving touch to The Best Cat In The World is a poignant story by Leslea Newman about a young boy named Victor who loses his beloved feline companion Charlie to old age. When a new cat, Shelley, comes to the household, she is different from Charlie in almost every way - she doesn't do the things Charlie used to do, or respond in the same way. But in time Victor learns that his new friend is unique and special, and every bit as much ""the best cat in the world"" as Charlie was, in this profoundly compelling picture book about grief and the slow process of healing. The Best Cat In The World is especially recommended reading for young people who have lost a treasured animal companion."
5,"The Power of the ""I AM.""","Thank you Janet Quinn for reminding us of the power of the ""I AM"" statement. I was inspired to CLAIM my truth; to claim all my parts; to feel all my feelings. And to do all this without judgement.I recommend this book to all women transitioning to their true selves --- the self not defined by a role, such as mother, wife, friend.Because of this book, I AM a more whole person. I honor the work it took to create this safe place for all women to find their voice.I plan to share this book with all my women friends so that the gifts of Janet Quinn's truth-telling benefits us all."
3,Couldn't use it,"I really did not get a chance to review this item because I couldn't use it. My mechanic said I bought the wrong item. However, it seemed to be a well constructed item that I'm sure would work for the right setup."
2,Flimsy construction,"The tool is made of bent sheet metal and lasted for only about 40 bulbs until the arms started to bend and buckle to the point it was unusable. The design does not tolerate much torsion from twisting and turning; definitely not recommended for heavy, clay soils."
4,Nice!,"It's a very nice basic album, and looks especially nice when you have a bunch all lined up on your shelf. The only problem for me was I ordered three in black, and was sent one green and two burgundy. So I returned them, and my money was promptly refunded. But I was still left with no albums. So I tried again and ordered through amazon. I again was sent two burgundy and one green! This time, I contacted pioneer directly, and they paid for the shipping to return it and very promptly send me three black. I had no problem with the album, just the repeated shipping problems."
3,"Pretty cute, but the pen is UGLY.","Got this for my daughter's baptism. It's very cute, has a spot for the date of her baptism (or christening, or blessing), parents' and god-parents' names, place. And it's a small coin holder. BUT it comes with a thick black permanent marker (which I unfortunately used). I ruined the block by using the pen -- it looks so tacky.HOWEVER -- if someone were to use a Sharpie Ultra-fine in a COLOR (pink, purple, even blue or green), they could make it look a lot nicer, and it would be a pretty little keepsake.For the price (around $17) it was a sad waste that I ruined the block. I would recommend getting it, but using a different marker. And practicing your calligraphy."
3,Christening Block makes a unique gift,"Makes a nice bapitism record, small areas for inscribing block with permanent black marker--serves as both a physical event record and 'piggy bank,' the latter of which might be underutilized. Appears to be relatively durable ceramic material."
1,overseas,"The reason these bits wear out so soon and do not hold up anymore is because now they are made overseas and with inferior material. This is with all products that used to be made in the USA and are now made overseas. The manufacturers find it cheaper to do this so they can expand their profits, but in doing so the sacrifice quality, customer loyalty, and the most important of all is another American worker is laid off."
5,Hell yeah!!!!!,"I think this is their best one. Plain and siimple. Got everything that's available from them INCLUDING the home video (""For Darkest Eyes)."
1,Makes me want to throw up,"I cant stand this album. I purchased this album as an import when it was first released and I was very, very disapointed. After such an amazing album like Turn Loose The Swans, they release this crap.WHERE THE HELL ARE THE DEATH METAL VOCALS ?? They are gone, all gone. Instead we are presented with whiny vocals that totally destroy the music. The music is pretty good, but I just cant get past the horrid vocals. One of the best things about Turn Loose The Swans was the interplay between clean vocals and death-metal vocals. Thats all gone and it has been replaced by whining."
2,Ringworld Throne = one trip too many to the well,"Larry Niven's third Ringworld book reads like something hewrote in response to pressure from his publishers. Nothing muchhappens in the first half of the novel, with the main characters from the previous two Ringworld novels appearing briefly, if at all.Things start happening in the second half, but by then it's too late, and the results seems to have been rushed -- especially the ending, which I had to re-read a few times to figure out what happened (or more precisely, what didn't happen).This novel should have undergone a major rewrite before publication, eliminating most of the first half and expanding on the second. As it stands, it's a major disappointment which adds little to the mythos of Known Space."
1,Not a patch on the first two....,"The first two ringworld novels were great, and I had read pretty much all of LN's work up to 10 years ago. I finished this book today and most of it made no sense. I assumed that this was due to the length of time it is since I read the first two Ringworld titles, but the other comments here suggest that I just wasted my time.No plot, the book rambles along and the ending leaves you thinking 'so what'. Not much is revealed about the Ringworld apart from serial 'rishing'. The first few hundred pages is irrelevant to the rest of the book."
2,Read the others before you try this one!,"Larry starts this sequel as if it really was chapter 3 as opposed to being Book 3. He doesn't waste one line on pre-history: who is Louis Wu? Who is the Hindmost? Why do we care? He doesn't give us a chance to remember all of the characters, why they're there, what roles they play or enough background to get a footing for a long time. He throws Machine People, Grass Giant and Red People names at us like we're supposed to remember 5-syllable science fiction names just like that! Couple that with a story that doesn't really begin until after page 225, and you have to be a real Niven nut (which I am!) to want to finish it.Typical of Niven lacking a solid, satisfying ending; we really deserved a neat wrapped package and we didn't get one.Even though I rabidly await each new Niven title, I must say that I'm underwhelmed on this one. I'd rather get some more great new Gil (the ARM) Hamilton stories!!! How about a series of stories about the Outsiders?Mark"
2,Running out of steam,"Some questions are best left unanswered. I know that fans of the original wanted more and more of the story. Ringworld was a great story and great concept and I loved the original. The anticipation of this book more was much better than the actual story.Even after reading other reviews panning the book, I read it -- and I read the whole thing since I wanted to give a fair opinion. It kills the time nicely and did keep me engaged, but so would Solitaire on the computer. In this case, both were equally productive. (Two stars because the residual Ringworld relation kept me interested)STAY AWAY."
1,dull and pointless disconnected plot,"I really enjoyed the first Ringworld book, and although the second (Ringworld Engineers) was a bit so-so, I was still willing to give this one a shot. Unfortunately, it was terrible. The plot is very disjointed and thrown together. There are at minimum two unconnected stories. The first concerns a group of vampire hunters. Louis Wu is largely absent for that part of the story. Most of the first half is spent with the reader wondering why any of this is important. The second half of the novel concerns Louis Wu and some protectors. I won't spoil the plot for you, but suffice it to say there is almost nothing new in either of these plots. You simply don't care what happens to the characters. Good grief, I don't want to ever read about another protector again."
1,As if the first two of the trilogy never existed.,"This reads like the work of an author who wrote two excellent books, then took some time off during which he explored funky religions and had an ""awakening."" The book opens slowly and pokes along, He inroduces many characters with interchangeable names. ""Rishathra,"" interspecies sex for treaty building etc. got small billing in the first two novels. In this one it becomes the focus. Things pick up a bit halfway through, but overall this has little in common with ""Ringworld"" and ""The Ringworld Engineers."""
1,The Pain!,Truly awful. An egregious waste of time and trees! Don't expect Ringworld or Ringworld Engineers. Expect frustration and disappointment.
3,An enigma,"It is not that bad! (Is it?) It certainly is hard work reading this and there are some weird errors in it (p248, of the Del Rey edition, has 'neoteny' backwards). What seems to have happened is that Larry Niven was writing the third volume in the Ringworld series and was making some progress (there are too some new ideas here!) and he met the author of Destiny's Road who was writing a background novel on some of Ringworld's inhabitants and they mixed their work to one heavy to digest total. As a reward Larry Niven allowed Destiny's Road to be published under his name. Who was this mysterious author? Perhaps some industrious but moderately talented young woman Larry fell in love with in his old age? An enigma, for sure."
3,enjoyable but the ringworld natives were dull,"I enjoyed this novel but there were some lengthy boring passages between the good parts. The novel gets boring when it concentrates too much on the Ringworld natives. Niven is at his best when he is creating true aliens and having humans react and interact with them. The Ringworld natives are essentially humanoids with different cultures. The good parts of the novel involve the old favorites, the Kzinti, the puppeteers and the Pak and to a lesser extent the vampires.Despite the boring bits, the novel follows logically from what we know from Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers, so I think Niven did a good job. The action sequences were well done. I wish there were more of this action... and frankly a lot less rishathra."
4,"It's okay, but not up to standards.",I started reading Larry Nivens Known Space stories when I was avery young teenager. My faovourites are Man-Kzinti wars and theNeutron Star. What I like about Known Space is that the stories tend to connect through a common historyline. Here Ringworld Throne fails a little. The protectors are not well cared for historically speaking. I would like more background of protectors next time around. The book did not catch me like most other known space stories. Try again Larry!
2,Disappointment,I re-read Ringworld Engineers before I went on to thisdisappointing fantasy. I am a Niven nut and have read everything.This book does not live up to the wonders of his imagination and writing. I hate to be publicly critical of an author I revere.
4,"Not perfect, but readeable","This book is a must if you are a hardcore Niven fan, ofcourse-who could resist another trip to such a fantastic environment!The plot and execution are not quite up to Niven's par, unfortunately-I found it a little confusing. Reading the two previous Ringworld novels is almost a must for obtaining maximum enjoyment-this shouldn't be as neccessary as it is."
2,Don't bother,"Ho-hum, another day on some part of the Ringworld, with fewrevelations. Larry is apparently now just writing to cash in on hisreputation, in the sad tradition of Asimov, Clarke, and far too many other once good writers. More proof that Heinlein had to have been the primary author of ""The Mote in God's Eye"". Still, it's better than ""Ender's Game"" or ""The Diamond Age"", because if nothing else, it's shorter."
2,Don't bother,"Ho-hum, another day-in-the-life tour of a portion of theRingworld, with few revelations. Larry has apparently begun to writejust to cash in on his reputation, in the sad tradition of Asimov, Clarke, and so many other once good authors."
4,Great job Larry!,I reread the first two books and then immediatelystarted this one. I would advice anyone else toread Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers first. I really enjoyed the detail about protectors on the Ring World in this book. I thought it was a very enjoyable read. Did not want it to end.
2,Dissapointing story in Throne.,"Ringworld is one of the top books on my list to read, I wouldn't recommend Throne to anyone. Everytime I would read a chapter I would re-read it thinking I missed something the first time. The story, of what there is of it, is hard to follow. I feel really bad for the people who never read the first two Ringworld books. So if you haven't read Throne don't bother"
2,A dismal ending to a fantastic saga.,"Ringworld, like the story which introduced it, WAS a cornucopia of mystery, adventure, science and diversity. Those attributes added to the rescue story, Ringworld Engineers. Sadly, in Ringworld Throne, the story centers around sex, mysteries are rapidly explained, and only a few chapters show Niven's expected flair. Where we expected a scrith ring, we find only a neon arch"
2,As confusing as the Mission Impossible movie,"Its been, what? 10 years since people have read the originals. How about some recap. By the time I recalled even the most rudimentary facts from the first two books, the new one was over"
2,Disappointing,"This book sat on my bookshelf for three or four years. For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to read it, even though I read several of the Niven-inspired Man-Kzin Wars collections, and even re-read several of the Known Space novels. When I finally decided to read it, I initially thought my disappointment was due to the length of time that had passed since I had read The Ringworld Engineers. I couldn't follow much of the descriptive passages, and found myself losing interest while reading.Upon reflection, however, perhaps I was expecting to read something other than what Niven wrote. That is, I was expecting a science fiction yarn featuring some of Niven's better characters. What I found was not science fiction but ""engineering fiction,"" and the attention to the characters reflected an engineer's sensibilities.I wish I could more highly recommend this book, but I cannot."
2,Disappointed,"After enjoying the first two books of this series (Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers), I was looking forward to learning more about this engineering marvel. What a disapointment. This book did nothing for me. I kept waiting for a climax that never came. It was ho-hum throughout the entire book. I wanted more - and was disappointed."
1,I Hated this book!,"Whatever happened to Larry Niven? When I first got into science fiction about15 years ago, it was Larry Niven's stories I always went back to after reading something terrible, just to remind myself what great stories were like. Does anyone else still remember the feelings they had as they read Footfall, The Legacy of Herot, Lucifer's Hammer or the first Ringworld novel? I sure do, and it was incredible! But let me tell you something; the gig is up. After reading this piece of trash, I couldnt bring myself to touch another Larry Niven work for months. And then when I did, it was a book that was even worse: Children of Beowulf (or whatever its called). I'd like to make a deal with Mr. Niven. If you promise to delete these books from the publisher's catalog, and NEVER speak of them again, I promise to spend my money on your next book. Deal?"
3,I expected better.,"Having greatly enjoyed both RINGWORLD and RINGWORLD ENGINEERS I was rather disappointed with this outing. It seemed to be more of an excuse to have the characters go around rishing with each other than to expand on the Ringworld mythos. A much better plot would have been to explore the question of who really built the thing as it had been implied in ENGINEERS that the Pak had only colonized it later. My own humble suggestion- a covert group of the Tnuctipun were the real builders and are now coming out of their stasis storage bunkers deep in the bowels of the command center and are appalled by the rampant infestation of alien beings on what was to be their safe and secret hideaway from the Thrint. Hey Larry, are you reading this?"
1,Ughhhhh...,"The first Ringworld novel was great, but it just went down from there. Why did Niven have to go and spoil that great seemingly empty ringworld of the first novel by populating it with all sorts of pitiful creatures. I mean, vampires? Give me a break."
1,"Forgettable? Yep, I forgot.","I needed to read some reviews here before I could remember if I had ever read this book. After seeing a few attempts at plot summary, I recalled that the answer was ""yes,"" but that the novel was so difficult and unfulfilling that I completely lost all memory of the reading experience. Coming from an avid Niven fan: avoid this book."
2,Niven's worst book,"Larry Niven is one of the best living SF authors, but he bombed out here. The only thing saving it from the horrible 1-star rating is the fairly exciting first half of the book. Notably, this did not feature Louis Wu, who even in the classic novels Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers seemed to be mainly a window through which the reader could see the real hero, the Ringworld itself. The second half dealt entirely with Protector politics. Had I not read the excellent Destiny's Road, I might have given up on Niven entirely."
1,Try Weekly World News instead,"Niven exhausted his ideas on Ringworld a book and a half ago. What a shame, because the notion of a ""planet"" with 600 million times the surface of earth could have so much potential - you'd think the stories could never run dry.What luck that my cat wizzed on my copy halfway through - I tossed it out and never looked back."
2,Long Awaited Book Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Larry's Niven's work for years, and I barely recognized his style in 'The Rinworld Throne'.There seemed to be many inconsistancies in the storyline, and details that went against the previous books.There is also very little mention of the previous storylines--anyone unfamiliar with the Ringworld, its technology, and its inhabitants will stay that way.Read the first two books and stop there."
3,Niven finally returns to Ringworld,"This is actually one of the better efforts from Niven in the last l5-20 years. I read Ringworld in the 70's and Ringworld Engineers in the 80's, so I had forgotten what had occurred previously. However, I don't think it is essential to read those books first.The plot is basically that in the first half of the book that the races of Ringworld join together to eradicate the vampire menace while having a few orgies along the way. In the second half of the book, Louis Wu, Hindmost and Acolyte, Chmee's son, are drawn into the civil war between the Protectors. I actually enjoyed the first half of the book more.The dialogue and direction got a little confusing to me as the book progressed toward its end. I have noted this before that I wish Niven would let the rest of us know what the heck is going on sometimes. He seems to have some problems getting that across."
2,Where did Larry Niven go?,"Larry Niven is one of my favorite authors. However, I'm beginning to wonder if space aliens have kidnapped the real Niven and replaced him with a robot. A robot with few, if any, of the real Niven's writing skills.The orginal ""Ringworld"" is wonderful, and ""The Ringworld Engineers"" is a more than worthy sequel. ""The Ringworld Throne"", however, is a major disappointment. How could this have possibly been written by the same author?I read this shortly after having read ""Beowulf's Children"" and I was equally as disappointed with that book. The original in that series, ""The Legacy of Heorot"" was top-notch Niven. ""Beowulf's Children"" didn't seem as if it could have possibly come from the same pen.Which brings me back to my original point. Space aliens, what have you done with our Larry Niven and when are you going to bring him back?"
1,"This is written with great respect for Larry Niven, just not for this book","It's worthless. Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers are science fiction classics. This is a muddled half-book of interspecies sex and random wanderings. Niven has written other good works since this one, so let's just call it an off-book, and move on. Nothing to see here.P.S. It annoys me though that the professional, established reviews were relatively positive for this book. Could they not say that Niven missed this once and move on too?"
1,A waste of time,"This book is not worth reading. Half of the book is devoted to random ringworlders who dont matter and develop the plot in no way. I could not stand to read about nasty alien sex every three pages. I skipped almost every chapter not involving Louis or Acolyte (Chmee's son, who could have been an interesting addition but sadly was not). It made the book almost bearable. Overall you can skip this book and not miss anything. Here is all you need to know.- There is a vampire protector in charge of the repair center.- He sucks at his job- Chmee has a son, Acolyte, whom he sent to learn wisdom from Louis.- Louis decides that ghouls would make a better protector than a vampire- He arranges it so that a ghoul becomes a protector and and overthrows the vampire protector- This book sucks"
1,The Wrong World,"An incomprehensible, amateurishly written and thoroughly dull effort. Not even a shadow of its two wonderful predescessors. Incredibly bad. It was an effort to get to the end and at the end I still didn't know what the point of the whole thing was.I've seen better writing from my ten year old daughter.Time to retire, Larry."
3,The Ringworld native are still dull,"I enjoyed this story, but I found the bits about the Ringworld natives tedious. The feeling is best described as Star Trek Alien syndrome--- there were too many oddly shaped humanoids hanging around. Niven is at his best when he is creating really strange aliens and letting them interact with humans. Humanoids interacting with humans aren't nearly as interesting. The story lines about old Niven favorites, the protectors, the martians, the Hindmost and Acolyte the kzin are what keep the book interesting."
3,A Mixed Follow Up to Ringworld Engineers,"The first half of this book had me scratching my head, trying to figure our what the heck was going on. I don't know if this was a product of the time it was written, and all of the horribly bad experimental movies of the early 90's, or if Niven just didn't have a good premise to start with. Still, I'm glad I read it.So should YOU read the book? I would say that if you loved the first two books, love the world, and want to read Ringworld's Children (the fourth book) then yes. The first half of this book is a tough, and fairly uninteresting read. The second half begins to look more like a normal Niven book and does redeem itself a bit.As mentioned, Ringworld's Children is reason enough why you should slog through this book. Ringworld's Children is an excellent book, and having read Ringworld Throne is important in that regard."
1,Hope Love and Disappointment,"I had hoped the new ringworld book would be excellent, I loved the originals so much I repurchased them and read the set as a trilogy. Wow was I disappointed, this book frankly just simply stunk,, I could write a long review but so many others have done a great job so read theirs. I am adding my voice so you avoid wasting your money and time on this book. I just don't understand how the author could of wrote this and said 'oh yeah this is worthy for the ringworld' I should of put it down and I kept hoping it would improve, nope never did, it sucked and if I could give it zero stars I would."
3,Ringworld Throne,"A fairly good read, multiple story lines, a little slow moving with all these different story lines going on, not as engrossing as the previous Ringworld Novels but still worth reading."
5,Lynn obviously loves food,"This cookbook is a loving introduction into some of the best Italian cooking I have tasted. Impressive dishes can be prepared from clear and easy directions; directions for advanced preparation and freezing are ideal for entertaining. The ragu recipes alone make this book valuable. Excellent tortellini, excellent peasant bread."
3,"Great read, but who wants overcomplicated peasant food?","I loved reading this book--the author is clearly passionate about food. I learned a lot from her explanations of various techniques. The recipes, however, take hours and hours to make, and don't look or taste like it. If I'm going to spend four hours on a Bolognese sauce, I don't want it to look and taste like the Hamburger Helper my college roommate used to eat when she was too drunk to know better. This book offers complicated recipes for very simple cuisine."
5,The Splendid Table,"This past fall we spent a week in the Piacenza area and interviewed relatives on old family recipes. Reading The Splendid Table is like being in Piacenza again...the pictures and stories are a realistic picture of this area of Italy. While some recipes are time consuming, the results are certainly worth the effort. Ms. Kasper's recipe for Pisarei e Faso is identical to an old family recipe; and the Cappellacci with Sweet Squash followed by Sweet Fennel Jewish Style and Chestnut Ricotta Cheesecake were the highlights of our New Year's dinner. This book is a tribute to the cooking of the Emilia-Romagna area and to the traditions of this area."
2,There has to be something better.,"I bought this mirror because of all the great reviews. But I am not thrilled with it. I have to see if I can find anything that works better for me. Maybe all the car seat mirrors are problematic. Who knows.The view in this is very clear, though small.The bigger downside though is that I have it attached for the middle seat in my mid-sized sedan and, as a couple other reviewers point out, it completely blocks the visibility of the car behind you. It actually spans the distance from the top of the seat to the roof of the car, splitting the rear window visibility in half. I thought I might be able to live with this, but I can not. I can't see the car directly behind me on the highway at all. I can't see if they are real close or far away or not there at all. I like to be able to see behind me because it helps me gauge my reaction in an emergency situation.So, I'm going to look on..."
5,Excellent in functionality,Easy to install. Image of baby is clear.One little drawback is that the bear kind of looks like a dog :)
4,Works perfectly,"This mirror is cute and the quality of reflection is great, not distorted like some baby-safe mirrors. I can see my baby perfectly!"
1,I got it and don't know how it got this many reviews!,The mirror is not much larger than other mirrors or more clear. I ended up returning it for a regular rectangular mirror. There was nothing special about this mirror!
2,Just Okay,"This mirror does not work with my Britax Roundabout 55 rear facing car seat because of the way that it needs to be tethered to the anchor, so I've put it in the seat next to it, and I can still kind of see my child. It is HUGE! There is no way that I would put this on the headrest. It would completely block my vision. It's cute, though, and the mirror image is really clear. I wish I hadn't bought it. I did post a picture of the different ways you can anchor the mirror."
4,clear reflection mirror,"the first thing i noticed when i received this was that the mirror was actually large enough and of high enough quality that you could see yourself. we tried it in the car, but couldn't get it adjusted right -- so i hung it on the wall by the changing table so baby can look right into it while i change him. i used a removable 3M wall hook (which are a miracle if there ever was one). the monkey itself has a pleasant look and is soft."
2,Too small and obstrustive!,"I bought this mirror thinking it would be better than the plain square one I bought at Babies R Us, but was very disappointed and returned it. The mirror attaches easily, but makes the reflection so small it's hard to see the baby's face. Also, the head stick ups and blocks the rear view unnecessarily."
5,Excellent MP3 Player,This MP3 player is excellent. It was easy to use and has very good sound quality. It is also very small and thin..comparable to an IPOD NANO. It also has a FM tuner that you can record from. I would recommend it highly especially with its cheap price.
5,Thank god for Amazon.com,"I was so happy to see this CD available, this CD was one that I lost in my divorce and have searched and searched for a replacement. I have all of Phyllis's CD's and cherish everyone. She was an amazing singer that just never truly got the credit she deserved. Thanks again amazon for bringing us these hard to find treasures."
4,Nice bike,"Great bike, no troubles. I'm a mechanic by trade and having and workingon many bikes in the past it was a breeze to assemble, the derailure needed some fine tuning to get it to run perfect but that was expected.I read the reviews before I bought this bike and one person said the ""left"" pedal threads were not correct when they tried to assemble it, here is a note to the novice, the left pedal has left handed threads, so it needs to be threaded into the crank in the opposite direction as the right pedal.Schwinn Southport Men's 7-Speed Cruiser"
3,Product as described but damaged in shipping,"The bicycle was as described, but was scratched and dented. I don't know if it was in the shipping to me or before then."
3,Wrong Items,"The front tire that was sent was too big for the frame. There were also some scratches on the metal frame which may have happened during shipping.Assembly was somewhat difficult but I'm also not a bike expert. I had the toughest time adjusting the brakes properly.It looks like the photo and seems to be a decent bike, slightly on the heavy side, but they sent the wrong tire so wasn't able to ride it."
5,I laughed so hard I broke an eyelash.,"The best Garfield book yet. I couldn't do my homework because my sister was laughing so hard while reading this book that I was totally distracted. Well, who wants to do homework anyhow?"
4,A collection of daily comics,"All this book is, is a collection of the daily comic from the last book with very little new material. I don't think they've created any new material for this strip sense Liz and John ended up together."
5,Good golly miss moly.,"This is a real deal, for your toys of all types. I would not hesitate to use in high heat tough applications, like rebarreling an AR."
5,It worked perfect!,Great buy! I love it. It worked great and it was a easy install project. Matched my jeep lights perfectly so I liked that a lot too!!
3,Whining Guitar,"A friend suggested Frank Marino because I love expertly-played bluesy guitar. Marino is a little to tinny and speedy sounding for my tastes though. Reminds me a little of Carlos Santana's style, but Santana is a whole lot better."
2,Don't try this at home.,"This album might be enjoyable to someone who likes simple (when comprehensible) lyrics, uninteresting music (nothing much but a heavy beat and loud guitar riffs), and the typical low-quality sound of a run-of-the-mill live concert CD. I suspect that the reason this group doesn't have a string of popular studio albums would be that their music, in a studio environment, would be immediately revealed as utterly ordinary, with the possible exception of a certain expertise possessed by Frank Marino himself.Like many reviews of concert albums, I also suspect that the good reviews of this one are mostly written by fans who have attended their concerts, and understandably enjoyed themselves (as most concert-goers do, regardless of the merits of the music). Listening to this music at home is a very different sort of experience."
2,What is it this book is about again?,"Honestly, its not a bad book, but the title and description on the back cover are very misleading. I think 'Memoirs of life and humor ON LEAVE during the cold war' might make for a more accurate title. What I mean is that the book itself really isn't about day to day life in the navy or funny stories from being at sea during the cold war. As a matter of fact, I don't recall ANY stories that took place at sea, this book really revolves around stories of drunken foolishness when on liberty in foreign ports (and to be fair, a good amount in Florida and other US cities too). Some of it is pretty funny, and it is an interesting read to say the least, but very little of the story has to do with anything besides alcohol."
4,A fascinating adventure!,"Daisy Bates appears to be delusional at times in recounting her adventures with the Aboriginese but this is still one of the most fascinating reads I've had in a long time! If you were to separate her tales from the fact that she lived on her own among the indigenous peoples of Australia during a time when it was shocking for a woman to do so, there would still be an incredible story of courage and perserverance. This is an account worth reading!"
2,If you enjoy fantasy and poetry this book is for you,"The author is highly imaginative and tells a lot about her own life in this mish mash. We never learn much about Daisy Bates. the author writes "" her body shudders like a dying rabbit and her new husband wakes and stares at his new wife..."" But the author is really describing her own childhood dream of an old man with his legs wrapped around her neck!!! Blackburn's ""very personal interpretation"" of the life of Daisy Bates seems to include Blackburn trying to overcome some of her own childhood traumas and problems with men. If little is known about Daisy Bates' feelings towards her husband, I'd rather have that than a lot of silly conjecture and fantasy. The prose is very good, very flowery and high flown, but it doesn't help tell the story of Daisy Bates. Like other reviewers, I will have to research Daisy, yes even after reading her ""biog"". It didn't feel balanced at all."
2,Interesting subject.....resulted in disappointing book,"I read this book for my reading group, and if it hadn't been the ""assigned"" book for the month, I would not have finished it. I was initially enthusiastic about the book because of its unique setting, and Daisy Bates sounded like an interesting character. Like most of my reading group's members, I was disappointed in the writer's treatment of Daisy's life. She failed to provide sufficient details to form an interesting and cohesive story. I found myself skimming through much of the book because I didn't really get to know Daisy well enough to care about her as a character."
1,The Movies are Great cant wait till 3 comes out in 2011,"The store I bought it from refunded me right away because it wasnt in stock as they had thought, so I cant rate them for something I never got, but I may do business with them in the future because of their honesty and quick response."
3,i might get it,"i might get this dvd set if i relly think about it. i dont know.i relly liked the 1st one, but i dont know about the 2nd one."
5,"Love MIB, MIB 2 is terrible",MIB 1 is great. MIB 2 is painful to watch. Even the Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones seem to be in pain throughout the movie.
5,All Time Best Seller,There is a reason this book is a classic. Read it to my kids and they loved it and so did I.
1,The Pilgrim's Progress (complete and unabridged version),"UNFAIR you are showing a wonderful book, which I have read and thouroughly enjoyed so I orderd (I thought) another one for my son. I was VERY disappointed when I saw what book had been sent me. It WAS NOT ""Pilgrim Progress in todays English"" which is the book that I was under the impression I had ordered. The one I received was the 'COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED EDITION"". The one I thought I would be getting is ""In todays English"". NO WAY can my young adult student begin to understand this language! I was very disappointed, but the cost of returning it would have been more than what I paid for the book in the first place."
4,Pilgrams Progress,"Received the book in a timely manner and the condition was as stated, i am totally satisfied with this seller"
5,Good book,"A must read. If you struggle with burdens, uncertainties, difficulties read this book. Then watch the movie. A fictional realm that allegorically maps out a spiritual journey"
4,I loved getting on Kindle app.,I bought it to come onto my ipad via the Kindle app. It was quick and very good reading . Glad I bought it.
2,Really not modern English,This version is really not all modern english or at least not conversational english. At times it is very stilted and sounds more like nineteenth century english.I had heard of Pilgrim's Progress all my life but never bothered to read it until now. After a dozen or so pages I stopped because the story is already known...I see no use in bothering to read it. It was instructional when it was written because so few people had read the Bible but now it's useless.
5,Pilgrim's Progress,What a great book. Excellent way to view the struggles that we encounter in our lives. Excellent way to explain CHRISTianity.I have read the original version and this version is much easier to read. It reads lilke a regular book
5,highly recommended,"Loved it. Timeless classic, just as inspirational today, as I'm sure it was to a reader in the 1600s. I would recommend this book for all ages."
3,It's ok but!!!!!,The English was good however they left whole parts of the story out or did not carry through with the dialogue as it was in the org.old English
4,Good read!,"Delightfully written; it captures a Christian's journey & our experiences very aptly. Would recommend to fellow believers, to help us stay the course."
2,Painfully Boring Gothic Fairytale,"I started watching Spike with an open mind, but it quickly became one of the most disappointing movies that I've seen this year.The film follows the story of four friends who find themselves in an ominous forest after a tire blowout. They come face to face with a beast that shares a connection with one of them.The good news is that the costume design is great. For being a low-budget flick, the overall video quality was better than most Redbox movies.The bad news is that the movie is just boring. Lots of mediocre acting, laughably bad animal scenes, minimal gore, and the most annoyingly emo monster in film history. The romantic dialogue is corny, and the film's pacing is awful. To make matters worse, Amazon and IMDB both are completely littered with fake positive reviews for the film.Beauty and the Beast has left the building. Normally I'd suggest that people rent a movie before deciding to buy it, this is one occasion when I'll suggest passing on it altogether."
2,I LOVED YOU LIKE A STUFF ANIMAL,"Three girls and a guy (2 couples) crash their car due to a blow out. The guy (Jared Edwards) gets injured while being outside the car and has a spike in his neck. His girlfriend springs into first aid action and applies the proper first aid, something rarely done in movies. She even constructs a stretcher out of skis and a sleeping bag. Meanwhile there is a porcupine man (Edward Gusts in the title role) running about who speaks in poetic lines.The movie is a weird Beauty and the Beast love triangle. As it turns out Spike and the girl (Sarah Livingston Evans) were childhood friends who became separated. The movie is boring and shot at night so the scenes at fairly dark. While there are a total if 5 characters in the film, he centers around 2 of them. You keep waiting for something to happen, but it is more of a drama than a horror.F-bomb, 2 girls briefly kissing, nudity (Sarah Livingston Evans), no sex thank goodness."
2,Had so much potential,"Stars are for the guy playing Spike and the makeup artist. Otherwise, this is slow, dull, and we are never told how Spike came to be, how he knew the girl he apparently grew up with, what became of his parents, or how he can even sleep covered in all those spikes.Quoting from classic lit romance stories does not help."
1,What a waist of time,"What a waist of time and a really cool spike costume. Who is it that thinks this is a good movie ? The only way you could write up a good review for this junk is if you worked on the movie, other wise I just call B.S. on any review higher then 2 stars. This is one of those ""Monster"" movies that is better left in the shadows and not in the light as you can plainly see this lame actor is wearing a costume with no make up. Why would you use a bright light in every other scene to light up every flaw in the costume and not use a little make up to blend it all in ? It really is worth seeing just so you can point and mock at the sad final cut. If your are not into seeing poor film making, bad acting and shoddy story telling stay away from this mess."
3,Hold Me Tight... AAAAAGGGHHH!!...,"SPIKE is a love story w/ a tragic, spiny mutant in it. It's sort of a cross between BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS w/ a bit more blood. I did enjoy the female characters, including a tough, resourceful chick w/ medical knowledge. There's also a guy who spends most of the movie on his back, bleeding. As for the ""monster"" himself, he's an emotional wreck, unable to get past the lost love of his life. Is it sappy? Yes. Does it drag on? Yes. Is it a complete catastrophe? No. I liked the beginning and the ending. The middle part gets long-winded, meandering a lot. If this had been about 20-30 minutes shorter, it could have been a classic... P.S.- The thorny suit of the title creature is pretty cool..."
1,If you watch- make sure you are spiked first!,"Let me start by saying I love my spouse. However, the rental of this movie (and I use the term movei lightly) would hold up as grounds for divorce in any court of law! Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No acting, no plot, no coherent story line- you get the drift. I suppose if you are a liberal who is stoned or drunk, you might enjoy this. Suffice to say, if you want to be creative for Christmas- forgo the lump of coal in the sock and stick this in there instead! (PS- I will pay the producers of this movie to get out of the film business.)"
1,Worst Grossest Coffee Candy Ever - YUCK!!!,"I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had. I should have known, seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup. Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you."
5,best coffee flavor ever!!!,Can't always find this in my supermarket.. so easier to stock up...and it stays very fresh. I have gotten my friends hooked on this!!!
5,Bali's Best Coffee Candy,I discovered these candies at a Fry's electronics store of all places. They are WONDERFUL! Robust coffee flavor with just the right amount of sugar. They make a great pick me up or little something to tide you over between lunch and dinner. Delicious and addicting. I have gotten four colleagues hooked on them too. Could not find them for sale any longer at Fry's or anywhere else in town. I located them on Amazon and got a smoking deal. Definately worth a try.
4,"Good and comprehensive guide, a little difficult","It is a good and comprehensive guide, it has a lot of animal tracks, I found it a good and complete guide, but honestly sometimes I had a lot of difficult tryng to find some kind of tracks that I found.In my personal opinion I think that this is a very good book for experts on the field but not so good for beginners in animal tracks. And by the way it doesnt have any color illustration, and altough they are not needed I was very familiar with peterson guides and this one is a little different."
5,Good product,"I bought this product for my granddaughter who has eczema and cradle cap. I washed her hair and she seem to slow up on her scratching. I have yet to have any complaints because she seem to be doing better, combining this product with the conditioner. The smell is not bad."
4,Great results!,Shampoo is exceptional and got rid of bad scales instantly. Will continue to use and buy...
4,As Expected,"Nice smell. Doesn't lather quite as much as shampoos with SLS in them, but that's why I bought this one...no sodium laurel sulfate. I plan to buy this again. Next time I might try the conditioner, too. My hair seems fine without any conditioner, just this shampoo. I'm satisfied."
1,neeme shampoo,"this shampoo is very harsh it dryed my hair out bad with 1 use ,i had to put major oil treatments on my hair after using this shampoo"
4,Satisfied So Far,"I am using this shampoo in conjunction with Nizoral Anti-Dandruff shampoo. I have started to make a positive effort moving toward ""greener"" and more ""natural"" solutions to products and foods. What drew me to this shampoo was its lack of sulfates. Using this with the Nizoral has started me in the right direction for obtaining a healthier scalp with less irritation and dandruff compared to using Head & Shoulders (NEVER AGAIN!). I really have no complaints about the smell what so ever and was surprised at how good this shampoo was at foaming considering it is without sulfates. One thing though is that this shampoo is very thin compared to other traditional shampoos so you have to be careful not to waste by letting it slip off your hands. Using a sparing amount, get a good lather and enjoy!"
4,Gentle shampoo,"I purchased this because I thought it might help with scalp eczema. It did not affect the eczema at all. This shampoo is very thin, so it will go straight to your scalp and feels cooling to the scalp. It does not have much lather. I have to use a conditioner after using this shampoo but I have long hair. I have the best result not trying to lather it in but just gently rub it in as to not make too many tangles. It cleans well but is not drying to your hair. It does have a earthy herbal fragrance. I have used several bad smelling shampoos for eczema and this one does not smell that bad."
5,Exactly as described. Love it! Will do business with them again.,Exactly as described. Love it! Will do business with them again.Exactly as described. Love it! Will do business with them again.
2,Consistency,"The product was okay. Did not like the thin consistency. Otherwise, okay. Promptly shipped. Love some of the other products."
3,Natural product,"The packaging for this shampoo was horrible!!! The cap to the shampoo was not screwed on tightly so I had a little leakage problem. The smell of the shampoo is NOT pleasant! If you want a shampoo that makes your hair smells good; this product is not for you. After using this shampoo, my scalp feels the same nothing significant changed. The only good thing I can say about this product is that they use natural products."
5,Fast,"The Mythbuster: Collection 1 arrived very fast and in brand new condition, no dents or tears. I am looking forward to getting him the next collection."
4,Nearly Perfect,"As a 14 year-old, so-called pyromaniac, this show hits the spot for me, just not this season. If you are like me, and watch the discovery channel, hoping that some ship will sink on The Deadliest Catch, or that Bear Grylles will finally fall to his well-deserved doom on Man vs. Wild, this show is just the same. I personally watch this show hoping to see some amazing explosion that will break some Guinness-World-Record for the largest explosion held by some Russian guy whose name is harder to pronounce than an island in Indonesia. The truth about this season of Mythbusters is that things aren't as dramatic. Although the show gets much better as it matures, the first couple of episodes help the cast members find their comfort zone, and this makes the show MUCH more enjoyable. On the debate on weather-or-not to buy the box set, I say buy it."
3,The Face and Other Fantastic Tales,"Dondiego is young yet but he has kept writing and I am sure his promise is being fulfilled. His recent works, which I will read, are bearing that out."
1,Don't order this lamp!,I keep reordering this lamp but they keep sending it without the shade.House of Troy DL20-WB 1 Light Wall Swing Lamp in Weathered Brass
3,works but not very durable,"I purchased this bag to contain and protect my Camp Chef stove. it works good but the corners are a high stress point and they are NOT reinforced in any way so it dosen't take long for the legs to poke through the material. I store the stove in my travel trailer in the bag, so the only time it gets moved around is at a camp site when I take it out of the trailer to set up at camp. We camp often and use the stove a lot, but very lite use as far as the bag goes. In my appinion the bag should have lasted much longer."
5,Don't leave home without it.,"Essential to have if you are going to camp or travel with the Big Grill Box. Makes carrying Grill Box much easier and helps in keeping all the Stove & Grill Gear organized. Keeps debris out of your Grill Box and keeps any food drippings from leaking onto your other camp gear. Not fun when black grill grease drips or rubs off onto other camp gear or clothing. Bag may be a little thin for any real protection to Grill Box from Bumps & Bangs and possible wear through if not very careful packing next to other metal or rough surface items in your camp gear. The handle carry straps however Do encircle the entire Box and are plenty strong to lift & carry it. My best satisfaction comes from being able to carry it and keeping everything ""Clean""."
3,Hot in Da Club!,This DVD is kind of misleading but overall it is cool. This is a DVD of performances in a club. The people in the club were not hype at all but the performers were somewhat trying hard. Its not what I thought it was but its cool. If you can find the bootleg then I would recommend that.
5,Release the beast,This is a great collection of Irish pub fair that will have everyone in car the singing. This is the fourth copy of this I have purchased to give as a gift.
5,I love It!,I read these poems over and over again. The writing is very rich in images. I love some of the surprise elements. I love the book.
3,"good performance, mediocre to poor sound quality","There is something not right with the sound quality on this CD. The performance is rather good, but after a while the sound gets to be grating, especially the female voices. I have heard Troyanos live and her voice is quite pleasant to listen to. On this CD I found her voice to be irritating, so it must be the recording. I doubt I will listen very often to this particular recording. There are more enjoyable Normas out there, so I would be hard pressed to recommend this one."
1,DOES AMAZON TAKE RETURNS?,"If you like annoying repetative music this disc is for you! Nothing much in the way of lyrics, and undancable rythmes make this a dud! I've enjoyed Susan Morabito's work in the past, so this disc was a big disappointment. Cath by sunscreen is the best on here, and its just average. Phunky Phantom's Get up Stand Up warrents special mention as the worst track on this piss-poor disc. Trust me I'm a nurse, don't go here."
5,THE BOOK on musical notation,"This is a very complete work. You get a very detailed description of every important notation system used from 900 to 1600. Even the slightly different systems, like Milán's vihuela tablature, are not just mentioned... they are discussed.If you are interested in white notation, tablature (lute or keyboard), you need this book."
5,Loving It,"What can I say but without a shadow of a douht ""This is my kind of Coffee"" Enjoying it to the Max"
4,Interesting...,"I'm not a fan of these premixed but I did like this? It was not to sweet, it was not bitter? I shared with my Mom and she likes it as well? I may purchase again?"
4,Delicious!!!,"I've been trying to cut back on my caffeine/Starbucks addiction for a while without success until a friend introduced me to this brand. I loved it from the moment I tried it. I cannot believe it has no caffeine! It is super easy and convenient and I can enjoy it at any time. I just boil some almond milk and serve, done!! It is delicious! I've also tried it with soy milk and it is just as good.My hubby will be so glad to see I finally cut that crazy high Starbucks expense from my budget!!!Totally recommend this product!"
4,alright,This cd seemed very good - but it isn't my particular cup of tea. But I haven't decided to sell it yet either. Four stars for now
5,Great little camera!,"This camera is loaded with features, but still easy to use. My Mom is a professional photographer and proclaimed this the best point and shoot ever. Bought one for herself, for me and my brother as well! She especially likes that it has sports/action capabilities. I have fun using the captions now and then (they are optional, so you can turn them off completely if you don't want them). It's nice and compact. Most importantly, it takes beautiful pictures!"
3,Red Eye -- Red Eye ...,"I had a Ricoh 35mm for about 12 years (I loved that camera - I took it everywhere). It finally just broke. I needed a new camera - after many hours of research we decided to buy a canon. We bought the 85 and the 120. We took identical pictures with both cameras. The 85 had red eye problems even when the red-eye function was on. The 120 has similar but fewer red-eye problems. The color and crispness was beautiful. However, the red-eye simply ruins the photos. I never used the red-eye function on my Ricoh - and when reviewing my last few hundred photos - I noticed that I never had red-eye. I'm so dissapointed that Ricoh no longer sells the 35mm. I returned both cameras. I am now stuck with no camera. Do not buy this camera!"
3,Works well but a bad lens,"I just returned from taking this camera on vacation to Europe. I am decidedly disappointed with the results when the lens is fully zoomed. With the zoom, the photos are vignetted. On the plus side, the color with this camera is good which means the coating of the optics is OK. They just should have never put a 120mm zoom on this camera.One other positive feature. The red-eye reduction works well unlike some other point and shoot cameras. Also, the flash throws a long way."
3,Got to have steady hands !,"I have used a Nikon 38 to 90 mm point and shoot camera before. This gave a lot of good pictures, but the red eye reduction in that was not good enough. So I decided to buy this canon camera.This camera gives great outdoor photos. Normally most of these point shoot cameras do give good outdoor photos. But the real test is in the indoor photos. The flash range is not much, so the faces come dark if you are beyond 10 feet from the camera. This is not the case with nikon (but the nikon drains the battery really fast, due to the brighter flash).Secondly you have to hold the camera steady even after clicking the photo for another one to to seconds, else the photo gets blurred. I discovered this after printing the roll and getting quite a few blurred photos. So you got to use a tripod or have very steady hands."
5,Work Great With XBOX,"After checking all the message boards I could find, I was becoming convinced that I needed to spend a small fortune on various digital theater components to get the proper sound from the XBOX. All I did was plug the speakers into the decoder/amp & plug the optical cable in to the amp + the XBOX & everything worked perfectly (Dolby 5.1 & DTS). These speakers sound great at a volume that is more than enough for a 12x14 room. Everything you need is included except an optical cable . Also comes with a nice little remote for volume & effects etc. Bass is clean & although not quite as good as a powered sub is amazing for what these cost. Well worth list price, but incredible at the sale price."
2,I'm not Quite Sure about These Speakers,"I've got two sets of these speakers. The older set, for the most part, works fine. I've had occasions where I lose the rear speakers and I'm not too sure that I'm getting proper sound out of the subwoofer. But, for my needs, they're fine. The newer set (about 1 and 3/4 years old, now) are more of a problem. After days of checking and swapping settings, cables, connections, and amplifiers, I've determined that the digital DIN connector on the back of the amplifier has just stopped working. I ended up putting my Audigy sound card back in analog mode and running four-point sound out of that into the RCA jacks instead of the 5.1 digital sound. Again, that's fine for my use. But, I'm rather upset that an amplifier connection less than two years old would just quit. The speakers sound fine. It's just that the problems I'm having with the linkages make me wary of buying future Creative speakers."
1,Pathetic Sound,"In an attempt to find a 5.1 replacement for my dated FourPoint Surround Sound system (Also a Creative Product), I came across the 5700 Series. The only reason I gave it any stars was the fact that it had a remote...a big plus. However, I am willing to sacrifice that for sound quality. My two-year old system with less power somehow produced lower base, crisper highs and a nicer midrange than this set of speakers. I promptly returned them in exchange for the Klipsch ProMedia 5.1 system. I am very happy with this setup, and with 500 watts total power, the bass and sound reproduction is closer to where I want it.Save your money and buy the Klipsch...you won't regret it."
3,Starting Over,"The title of this film refers to the way in which its protagonist manipulates well-meaning strangers to provide her with money which she needs to survive given her relinquishment of a financially comfortable but ultimately deadening marriage to a shallow, self-absorbed man who cannot see Karen as a person in her own right to save his life. Beautifully photographed and well acted, Karen Cries On the Bus is a gritty, often disturbing examination of the profound difficulties generally encountered when a socially isolated individual possessing little native talent is precipitously thrust into society with no resources except the wile and determination to make it on her own whatever the cost. My problem with the film was that I often found Karen to be an unsympathetic character but that did not stop me from remaining absorbed by the film-making throughout. 3.5 stars."
