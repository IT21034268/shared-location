2,What Is It?,"Sordid, violent, insidious, and that's only the beginning. A character in Dirty Sally asks, ""What is the largest creature in the world?"" and then answers, ""A network of cypress trees. The roots are attached, tree to tree, over a span of a hundred miles. You can cut down one tree but you can't kill the roots. Evil is like that. You don't beat it. It draws back and pops up somewhere else. But it didn't move. It's here, there, it has a network that stretches across the world."" OK, so if this is true, then why live? What are the characters in this book doing besides killing, mutilating bodies and having doped-up or drunken sex? Are we actually supposed to believe a love story develops in this sordid mess? But what really threw me is the kingpin behind it all's justification for causing these rivers of blood and semen, lame to the extreme. But I guess it must be me, for the jacket says, ""Noir fans will be hungry for more."""
4,"Edgy and dark, but good...","I started reading this book because I picked up Little Faith first and realized it was like the fourth in a series. Simon does a good job with Dirty Sally. It's gritty and dark. It started off a little slower than I would have liked and took me a little longer to read than I usually do. Towards the middle though, it was really engrossing. I enjoyed it. Now I'm ready to continue the series...."
3,"Not bad, but confusing...","I like his writing style, but too many characters are introduced, then killed off. The plot is a bit tangled as well. For me, this one was barely worth (3) stars."
4,Promising Debut...but hold the Ellroy comparsions,"This is a very fine debut novel. Reles is a GREAT character. A jewish boxer cop in Austin? Cool stuff. The story is complex and has solid twists and turns (if does get a bit nutty at the end--too much? That is for each reader to decide). However, the Reles character does indeed keep the book going and I look forward to other adventures with him. The book twists enough cop book cliches to keep it interesting. However, this one novel does not a James Ellroy make. THe opening chapters do sound a lot like Ellroy's trademark staccato style, but the narrative style is not enough to make a fair comparison. Perhaps, a few books down the line, Simon will be fairly compared with one of the greatest living American writers. Give the man some breathing room!"
3,"Oops, forgot something","This is a very well written book, drawing you in and keeping you reading. But alas, there is one major flaw - the publishers forgot to include the last chapter. I'm sure this must be the case, as no competent author would just end his book like this.Hopefully, when the paperback version comes out, it will include the book's lost ending. As I was reading it, I kept thinking that I'll definately buy this guy's next book - until there was not even a wimpy ending - it just stopped.Is this a cliff-hanger? Will there be a sequel? I'd wait to see if there is before buying this book."
3,Used to be Great / Why not Now???,"I have bought Tender White for years & have always enjoyed the flavor. I didn't even mind paying the extra cost. However,now for the past Year(2010)I have had the most loose HUSKS in the popping bag & in the bowl while eating that is enough to make me throw it out! At times the husks are so thick I choke on them!! WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY OF ORVILLE POPCORN?? I have bought cheaper brands that have popped much better. No one else carries the Tender White,that I can find,and so I would REALLY APPRECIATE O.R. cleaning up their act and getting a GOOD QUALLITY back on the shelf. I wonder are they using a LOWER GRADE kernel and trying to pass it off as a ""GOURMET"" popcorn,that they were KNOWN FOR IN THE PAST? I want the good stuff back again!"
2,Hardly pops,"This must have been old even though it was not outdated. My cheapie brand pops better than this. Otherwise, it tastes good. I won't buy it again since I only get half the bag to pop."
1,POOR,"The popcorn arrived full of melted grease and it was not from the box sitting out in the sun. I retrieved it as soon as it was delivered. The boxes were greasy. Too much of the butter had melted throughout which left me concerned about the quality of the product. I used what I could because I just didn't have time to go back and forth over popcorn. I will never buy popcorn through Amazon again. Tender White was my favorite popcorn until this experience, but not any more."
2,Disappointed! Poor Product Quality (Check Expiration Dates!),"Like some other reviewers, I also had a problem with the quality/expiration date on this product. I placed the order on 10/01/11, but the product I received had an expiration date of 10/03/2011. Unbelievable.I probably won't buy in such a large quantity again. Please be careful when purchasing and check the dates when your receive items. Orville Redenbacher Tender White is one of my favorite flavors. I am a long time Amazon shopper, I hope their quality is not starting to deteriorate like this. Expected a little better than this. Lesson learned. Disappointed to say the least."
5,The greatest popcorn ever,This is my very favorite flavor of Orville Redenbacher's microwavable popcorn. It is everything it's popped up to be and more. I always have some on hand.
3,not impressed!!,"thought this wasgoing to be hardly any kernels and great butter taste, rendenbacher movie theater popcorn has better taste and less grease, and less kernels bought it at walmart."
5,Best Popcorn,"My children love to eat popcorn every night. We have been searching for a popcorn they could both agree on. My daughter likes lots of butter, my son not so much. One day I lucked on to Orville Redenbacher's Tender white microwave popcorn and we found our solution. Everyone in the family loves it! Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find in stores - enter Amazon. It's great having this hard to find popcorn delivered to my house."
4,Many fun recipes,"Lots of fun recipes, some are a little involved for doing with children, but good suggestions on how kids can help with each recipe"
5,Disney cookbook,"beautiful illistrations. simple to make, encourages your little ones to have fun with cooking and eating different foods"
5,Excellent book,This book covers many aspects of flash photography that I did not know. It is very easy to understand and implement.
2,Average Mark Murphy,Not enough Mark Murphy on the video. Should also show date of taping. Music however was excellent.The musicians names should have been spelled correctly. The bassist was Monty Budwig not Budding.
3,Wish there were more Mark.,"Maybe there is a paucity of footage of Murphy, but the manufacturers had to fill out the DVD with more footage of the Candoli brothers than of Mark Murphy, which was the reason I purchased the DVD.The footage of Mark is very good, however, and if a person is prepared for the small volume of material, it can be quite enjoyable to watch."
3,50 / 50,First two stories are really good. Last two by Janet Spaeth and Kathleen Y'Barbo were not good. They were boring. Guess two good stories for this price is not a bad deal.
3,"Good fundamentals, but cheesy licks",I've purchased other books from this author and should have know that his style is a bit on the cheesy side. I will say that he does a good job explaining the theory behind the licks.
4,Engaging book,"""Stoner"" was an engaging book. A tale about love in many forms and the trials each form can have. In the end, his life could have been much more."
4,"The most complicated ""boring"" man","Granted, this isn't a exciting read; however, it is a fulfilling read. Stoner, the mediocre professor at the University of Missouri at first study could be considered a failure. Almost all of his relationships could be summed up as cold and distant: his parents, wife, and child. In the midst of that throw in a middle age torrid love affair with a younger colleague; even that affair hardly rocks his world. He lets the world and those around him determine who is he rather than ever rebelling against unfairness, boredom, or tradition. Yet, in spite of all that, in my opinion, he moves from a tragic figure to one that is to be respected (admired is too strong a word). Stoner is indeed a rock. Through the ups and downs of a marriage and a career, he remains solidly the same.The writing is beautiful in this book. The story is poignant, thoughtful, and though provoking."
4,Good story,"I had not read John Williams before, but this is a very good book. The story itself is a little slow, but the characters are very well developed despite their introspective nature. Williams' detailed knowledge of the human thought process is amazing."
5,Book Club Favorite,"My classics book club recently reviewed and rated the books we've read over the past five years. Only Stoner recieved top ratings from all our members (Vanity Fair was second). The stoicism of Stoner and his family rings a familiar and heartbreaking bell for those of us with roots in prairie farm communities. It is a beautiful, sad read. Enjoy."
4,Great story about an ordinary man,"This is a really nice, quiet story, rather uneventful about a rather average man. It sounds boring, but it's not at all. Stoner is born a farmer, his father expects him to run the farm when he returns from school and instead he is lured by academia and becomes a university professor. His career and life are both rather uneventful. He marries, has a child and dedicates himself to his work. The characters are extremely well drawn without being caricatures, his strange wife, the professor that is his memesis at the university, his lonely daughter. THis is a very difficult book to describe, you might expect the usual saga that is found in books covering the span of a life, but this is much more subtle. If you like thoughtful, well written stories that engross you with their simplicity, this is for you."
4,Everyman,"Rejecting the plotless postmodern novel, John Williams believes the novel should deliver a good story. Stoner does tell the sad story of a man's everyday life. Although this life has high points, and the story is told beautifully, it plays in one low key. The reader knows that the story has to end as it does in classic tragedy. Romeo and Juliet both must die; Anna Karenina must be killed by the train, ect. This novel, however, just leaves me depressed at the sadness of ordinary life. The story has psychological intensity, but the text somehow does not deliver. Rather than the keen stab of emotion imparted by a tragedy, this novel produces the dull pain of a toothache."
2,emotonally crippled people,"If you think a book must be depressing, hopeless, and about unhealthy people who don't really want to change, than this is the choice for you. It is well-written, but pointless, falling into the genre of fiction about pathetic losers failing to find any glimmer of happiness or meaning or joy or redemption.I am not suggesting that fiction must be happy, but this book is just too much about failure and mean-spirited revenge. There are no good guys. The main character watches as his little girl's life is destroyed by his wife, and doesn't stop it! Or even try to stop it. Angry and Hopeless: and do we need another book about such people?Sure, there are such people: by why wallow in their misery?"
2,Disapppointed,"I was prepared to like/love this book, as so many reviewers I respect (including the novelist who wrote the foreword) call it a great novel. It is well written....but about characters I would not want to spend time with in life. The title character, an only child, is flat emotionally, as were his parents. I read that the author views Stoner's life as a triumph solely because he did what he wanted to do (teach literature). It didn't FEEL like a triumph. A depression hovers over Stoner and the novel. For most of his career he wasn't a good teacher; his long marriage was a disaster; his university career was dead-ended by a rival. He dies forced into an early retirement, tended by the neurotic wife from whom he has been estranged for decades. I want to find one character who holds my interest in any novel I read--even a villain, as long as (s)he's compelling. I didn't find one here."
2,"Zero Emotion, Depressing Throughout","This is one of Tom Hanks's 5 favorite books, according to a recent interview/article. A review on the back cover calls it a ""perfect novel."" While it is not badly-written and uses vocabulary well, nothing is described using any of the five senses. Reading the book, I don't know what anything looks like, smells like, tactilely feels like, etc. My main complaint is that every character lacks the expression of emotion of any kind. The story covers decades, yet, every character is flat of emotion and either doesn't fulfill any purpose in life or doesn't attain any joy from the fulfillment. The author is clearly intelligent; it is the story I do not consider worth reading, as it does not provide enjoyment or lesson learned."
4,Sad but fulfilling,"I almost abandonned Stoner when I first encountered it. It seemed so slow and pessimistic but I'm very satisfied that I gave it another chance. Despite its somewhat pedantic discussions of literature and rather slow start, once you get into the novel and observe how the hero develops from a sad sack to a fully rounded hero, you won't be disappointed in the novel. I was truly sorry to finish the book and would definitely recommend it. Not just for English majors, but for anyone who appreciates someone who stands up for his/her principles."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"I just laughed like crazy at the pictures in this book. They are absolutely hilarious and go right along with the captions. The author certainly picked the right photos. He also dishes out sensible advice on finding the right man, but in our desperation to find one, we often forget this. What he says certainly does make sense."
1,Ugh,"Anyone with 5 spare minutes could have written the text for this book - I found it very cliche - I'll admit some of the photos are decent - but really why would you pay money for this? So-so"" photos don't make a good book."
4,Cute little book,"This is a great book -- especially if you really are looking for Mr. Right! The text itself is entertaining, but without the hilarious pictures to accompany it, I must admit I wouldn't have bought it. The pictures really make the book. Very cute! Also, for something deeper, I highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold, which has really helped me find happiness within myself as I continue my search for Mr Right!"
4,"Cute book, but men might not enjoy it as much as","The pictures and captions are hilarious and so true. I could not stop laughing as I flipped through the pages. I was actually laughing so hard at some of the pictures that I felt silly because I was sitting in a room all by myself laughing harder than I had in a long time.This book really is not a ""How to Find Mr. Right"" or anything like that, it is just a cute little book that pokes fun at men. Maybe it's just the men I have known, but the book seems to be pretty true.I thought the book was Extremely Funny, and I Recommend it, especially for any single girls!"
5,Another Dimension - A World Beyond,"The late author, Herbert Greenhouse, was always a meticulous and avid researcher, crossing the t's and doting the i's. I knew him personally, read and own most of the books he published. The Astral Journey reaches across centuries, exploring and researching both religious and scientific evidence of astral projection. My own involvement with the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) and the late Dr. Karlis Osis is included in these pages among others who worked with Dr. Osis.For any student researching out-of-body experience (OBE) this is a must read."
5,Fabulous!,"As always I really enjoyed this book! But, I felt sorry for Mrs. Cobb because her new husband, Herb Hackpole, died in the fire not that he didn't deserve it or anything. It was also such a waste because all those antiques burnt up in the fire. And it was ingenious when Braun made Koko want to go to the carriage house because he knew there was going to be a fire 2 hours before it happened.-Angel Granata,12"
4,Good Old Fashioned Mystery,"I discovered ""The Cat Who"" books by Lillian Jackson Braun sometime ago. I love them because they are simple, old fashioned stories. I am now reading the books I missed, starting with the first published book in the series. I usually read them on my Kindle, or listen on Audible. Some of the books are only available in print, not digitally. It was so easy to order on Amazon, and I have enjoyed following the story of Jim Qwilleran from the beginning. These books were written sometime ago and so do not include cell phones, etc. The murders that take place are without the gore of today's murder mysteries. I can speculate who did it, but it is never apparent until the end of the story. A great relaxing read!"
3,"In Which Qwill, Koko, and Yum Yum. . .",". . .investigate the death (was it murder?) of the local newspaper publisher.Alas, Qwill's doctor girlfriend has moved to Boston to specialize, leaving him without the benefit of female companionship. But not to worry! In ""Shakespeare"" we are introducted to Polly -- a widow about Qwill's age who manages the local library. In Polly, Qwill seems to have found a soul mate.Also, Mrs. Cobb, Qwill's landlady from Down Below (see ""The Cat Who Turned On and Off"") and his new cook and housekeeper (see ""The Cat Who Played Post Office"") decided to re-marry. Will the third time prove the charm for Mrs. Cobb?This mystery, set once again in Pickax (pop. 3,000) while not the best of the series is certainly an entertaining read. I enjoyed it."
1,Why is this the only one not on Kindle,Book is great but Publisher needs to put this one on Kindle along with all the others.This is the only one of the series not on Kindle and it makes me not want to get the others
3,A interesting look on British thought but difficult to get through,If you are curious about how the British felt about Napoleon than look no further. This book is an excellent account of how the British perceived not only Napoleon but the French Revolution. From Edmond Burke's opinions to parliament this book analyzes the whole package. The prose is a little difficult to get through leading to my three star rating but overall this book provides some interesting information that is unmatched in any other text. If you want to look at relations between the countries this is a good place to start. On that note however the book is really not for beginners but is a good addition to a reading list on how Napoleon's obsession with Britain led to his downfall.
1,Sony Reader Too Slow,"While this product is the case for the Sony Reader, just wanted to head off anyone considering the Reader itself. The time it takes to go from one page to another is way too long and will drive you crazy. And be sure not to buy it from the Sony Style online store, as their return police is horribel and intractable."
5,Must read if you listen to Texas music or 'alt country',This is THE book. I could not put it down. Every page was a jolt for someone who has listened to this music since 1974 or so. The newer added chapters at the end cover Robert Earl Keen and some newer artists. Just an amazing book about Austin music and everything you need to know about the difference between Nashville country and real American music.
3,Of more interest to locals,"This book focuses a lot on the people behind the scenes who made the clubs happen in Austin and some folks who didn't make it to the big time. An extraordinary local history, probably a tad windy for those only interested in the music."
3,Herb Steiner is NOT from Brooklyn,"Jan Reid needs to get his facts straight. He writes in this book that Austin pedal steel guitar player, Herb Steiner, an early member of Michael Murphey's and Jerry Jeff Walker's bands, moved to Austin from Brooklyn, NY. WRONG! Herb was raised in Southern California where he was a part of the fledgling country rock scene of the late 60's and early 70's, even playing with Linda Ronstadt before deciding to move to Austin in the early 70's. Brooklyn? Where did THAT come from?"
3,A so-so read.,"I'm not sure what I think about it. Mixed feelings I guess. Part of me was bored throughout the book and kept thinking maybe I should stop reading it, while the other part of me wanted to finish it to see how it ends.I could have done without all the history stuff. That's what bored me. I pretty much skipped over it.I did like who Norma ended up with at the end.I found the whole book rather dark, disturbing, and depressing when I expected it to be more uplifting, like other chick lit books. A bit of a letdown I suppose. I'm hoping that if the author does write another book that it wont be so much like this one.If you're expecting a funny, lighthearted, romantic chick lit, this book is not for you."
2,Good Grief Is It Noisy,"I bought this here at Amazon after seeing that it was given the number two spot as a top performer by a major testing lab. They mentioned it was a tiny bit ""loud."" Yes it does cool ok but my god it had a schreeching loud whistle (!) due to the way the air outlets were shaped. I tore the unit apart and stuffed some styrofoam in the outlet hole to change the shape just to bear having it around. When I say loud I mean like a police whistle!!! Now it puts out 30% less air but the whistle got shut up thank god. You could hear it outside in the garage!!!Yeah I could have sent it back, hassled with it, etc but we were talking about selling the house so why get too excited.The blower now is only loud enough to drown out my stereo (!) my TV (!) and can clearly be heard as a very loud noise downstairs on another floor.And guess what, we aren't selling. Damn it I hate it when that happens.If you pay for one of these don't say I didn't warn you about the noise."
1,Free ear plugs should be provided,This unit is the loudest a/c I've been around in my life. We are returning it as soon as possible.
3,"Features are pretty good, but LOUD","Noise is TERRIBLE! Even on the lowest fan speed, this model is extremely loud. Unfortunately, due to the fast fan speed, the sound is also high pitched - like a hair dryer - so is more annoying. Returned week after buying.Remote is nice though. It's almost a replica of the panel on the unit itself."
1,NOISY!!!!,I wish I had read these reviews before buying the Frigidaire FAA075P7A. This is without a doubt the loudest a/c I have ever heard. It was on sale for $199. I thought that was a pretty good price for an 8000 BTU energy star rated machine. Now I know why. It is going back tomorrow!
4,A very good air conditioner when purchased on sale for 169.99,"The frigdare a/c is a very good unit when purchased on sale...I purchased locally,to avoid the shipping damage that others have suffered with.The unit cools well and has a remote.The unit is very noisy even on low...The unit is very cheaply made...For 5 bucks more frigidare could have included real insulation,instead of the cheap cardbord,used in this...If noise is not an issue,this is a good unit to keep cool with.I payed 169.99 including installation....Now the prices are up for the summer sales!! Thank you from Stewart L/06/15/07"
2,"Cools the room, but so loud","I can sleep through anything so it doesnt bother me, but it is tremendously loud (sounds like you are sitting near a wing of a plane) But it does cool my large bedroom with high ceilings.So if noise doesnt bother you and its on sale get it."
1,Loudest air conditioner I've ever had,"This is the worst air conditioner we've ever had. It sounds like 3 hair dryers going at once. I can't even stand to be in the room for more than 15 minutes, and here we are in the middle of a heat wave! The cooling part isn't up to par either. It cools more like a 5000 btu unit. It's going back."
1,EXTREMELY LOUD,"This has to be one of the LOUDEST air conditioning units I've ever come across. All 3 settings are noisy and difficult to ignore. If you're trying to watch tv or a movie while its on, you have to blast your tv. I'm actually a heavy sleeper and not really affected by noise when I sleep but I could NOT sleep with this AC unit on.It also takes a really long time to cool the room. I honestly gave this product a chance but the noise was unbearable and I'm returning it today. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Good but not GREAT!,"I had to stop and think before i wrote this review. This is the 9000 btu Fridigaire room air conditioner. It works very well. It cools great. It even looks great. Easy to install, easy to control, BUT . . . so very noisy! Thats the only negative thing I can say. I had originally purchased an identical (looking at least) Fridigaire room air conditioner but it was a 6000 btu size. It also had all the positive attributes of this unit but it is so whisper quiet that I was impressed enough to buy the 8000 btu model for my living room.Bottom line - Super great unit but really hard to hear my television when its running."
1,I hate this air conditioner!,"This air conditioner is so ridiculously loud it makes you want to kill yourself! You won't be able to hear the TV or music or hear anyone talking on the phone! And it completely sucks, the btu's should cool my space but it's 80 degrees in here despite the fact that I set the air conditioner to 60 ad it's been running all day!!! I hate this thing!!!!!"
1,Loudest air conditioner ever!!! Stay away!!!,"This is the loudest AC we have ever had!! Stay a mile away. You have to shout to be heard above the annoying, high-pitch sound of the compressor. We exchanged it for a Sharp, which was much less noisy. I can't believe that they would roll-out a product like this!"
4,Graceful pianism in a useful collecgtion,"I have been looking for years for a recent recording of Chopin's four piano concertante works other than the concertos, and at last here is one and it fits the bill nicely. Older recordings, such as those by Arrau and Weissenberg tend to be yoked to less recommendable versions of the two concertos. Kolly really understands the spirit of these early works, and can deliver bravura and virtuosity when required, but he can also play poetically. The orchestra have an unrewarding part, but they play with spirit. Perhaps the piano playing does not have the last degree of fantasy and imagination, such as Argerich or Ashkenazy could offer, but then they have not recorded these works."
3,Mad and joyful !,"Had this stuff years ago on vinyl (an african issue), and enjoyed it a lot. Not really your easy skanking type : dubs and toasting all the way - if you like your reggae spacey ans stoned to the bone, this is recommended (or else, flip straight to Musical Youth, instead)"
5,Great Card! Two Machines with it!,"I have two computers with this card in it. With my nicer computer(p4 3.2g h/t, 1gig PC2700 RAM) it has no problem and runs great. With my slow computer(celeron 2.0g, 512 PC2100 Ram.) It still runs pretty nice. But if you have the system to support it it is a great buy."
5,Stunning,"Just to chime in, this is a great lens. While I use the 70-200mm f.2.8 IS more when shooting events, for portraits, this lens gives stunning results. The sharpness, colors, bokeh--they're all great. I own the 85mm f1.2, but would choose the 135mm first--if only for the extra reach and easier hit on your bank account."
4,"Beautiful stunning lens, just back up","This takes gorgeous stunning photographs, but it is a lot of lens. I nearly returned it, but then couldn't bare to. I hope I get enough use out of it. Lots of bokeh, and fast shutter. Not so great in low light without a tripod or flash, as I am wobbly. I have to back away from whatever I am shooting. This puppy takes a lot of space, and therefore reqires, at least for me, planned shots. Thankfully I have a good smaller lens, and a great longer range one. This fills out my kit, and it will be fun to take it out and shoot some portraits. I can't wait to use it, hopefully this won't just be a ""backup"" lens."
2,Religious content,"I'm a public school teacher not familiar with this publisher and author. As it contains references to the Bible and asks children to look up Bible passages, this won't work ""as is"" in my classroom, but there are many questions and thought-provoking prompts that I can incorporate into worksheets I've created. Many non-religious questions and prompts are not useful as I find them presumptuous and to be leading kids down one path of thought, not as an exploration of one way of thinking of an aspect of the story, but as *the* way of thinking about it -- not what I'm aiming to teach.Overall, since it's already here, I'll put out some pieces, but if I'd been able to peruse it before buying, I'd pass as there are other guides that are more thoughtful."
2,Bottle Disposable Liners,"Well I really wanted to use the liners to avoid washing the bottles, but am not sure if the liners tolerate hot water when warm up the breast milk."
4,Good Product,"This is a great product with a great concept. These things save time with babies that need/want to eat on the spot. Also on road trips they help with the need for less bottles. Other then the price, they are awesome."
5,Get component cables,"These cables work great. If you have a progressive scan DVD player, component cables makes all of the difference. The picture is clearer, the colors are brighter and more distinct. I got these on sale, so search around and you can find a good deal."
4,Belkin PureAV AV21000 cables,"Belkin PureAV AV21000-12 12-Foot Component Video CableI was trying to hook up an older component to my new LCD TV. My eyes are not as good as they use to be, but the picture looks great!"
4,Support for your child at school,"School dynamics have significantly changed and parents are facing new situations. There's a new level of pressure at the elementary age from the restructuring of the child's schedule to the level of academic pressure. This book is written with clear information for parents and practical advice on being an advocate for your child.From simple conversation with your child's teacher, to solving a significant challenge, this book provides parents with ways to approach teachers so that you can work together in a positive way. The author gives parents steps to take at home to stay informed on where your child is and how to support his/her learning at school. Throughout this book, the insights from teachers provide clever insights to help parents understand their teachers' perspectives."
1,It stinks,I listened once and threw it in the river. If I wanted to hear BJ Shaver wheeze on almost every song I would have bought an album with just him.I wanted to hear mostly our next governor
3,Mediocre at best,"I picked this book up because of the recent reviews but I have to say that it is mediocre at best. It starts out well but by the middle goes downhill. It just didn't hold my interest at all. I couldn't even finish it. I didn't care if they got together or not. The main characters where pretty one-dimentional. I give it three stars for drawing me in at the beginning. Maybe one day I'll go back and finish it. Maybe. Also, one thing that really annoys(sp) me is when I'm reading a Regency-era book and it's filled with contractions!)."
5,Wayniac,I have these speakers hooked up with 5 other various pairs of outdoor speakers. the Bose sure help to fill in the bottom end all around you
3,Managing the Social and Emotional Needs of the Gifted:,"This book is intended for a teacher new to a gifted program. The book discusses gifted characteristics and the particular emotional needs of the gifted in terms of managing a whole classroom of gifted kids. The discussions on the variety of learning styles and ideas for steering the gifted child to solve their own problems are helpful. However, there are no ideas for motivating/helping the gifted child who has mentally dropped out. The book would not be helpful for the teacher with only one gifted child in the classroom. A better resource would be "" The Survival Guide for Parent's of Gifted Children""."
3,No programming keys?,"I was rather excited when I heard about this keyboard, however now I'm not so sure. I assumed it would have some keys needed for TI-BASIC programming, at a minimum the STO key would be nice. But alas, it doesn't, just your standard keys. If you can't afford a laptop, I guess this would be nice for taking notes, but for TI-Basic I guess I'll stick to my laptop and TI-Graph software."
1,Flop 'N' Go,"I returned this shopping cart a few minutes after receiving it. The basket is made of plastic and the ""frame"" is made of very light aluminum with very few connections to hold it together securely: not the ""sturdy frame"" described online. A light breeze could tip this over, making it inappropriate for toddlers."
1,piece of junk,"This is a complete waste of money! I thought that because it has metal parts it would hold up to my twins' play - not at all! The basket is flimsy plastic and made of several pieces you have to snap together, and they come apart whenever you put anything with any kind of weight in it (I guess that's why the toy comes with play products made out of paper). My 2 year-olds snapped the bottom metal grid part off of the piece where the wheels are, and my daughter actually got her sock snagged on the metal, so good-bye sock (luckily her foot was ok)! I'm very sorry I bought this thing, because now I have to go buy another, sturdier one."
3,Needed another one,"We purchased a shopping cart that looked like this one several years ago and because of more grandchildren playing at our home at the same time, we purchased another one. The new one is very flimsy and we are sure it won't hold up like the older one. The company shipped quickly."
2,A disappointment,I brought this for my 2 years old son who loves pushing shopping cart. This toy grocery cart looks real enough but I must say the real thing is so flimsy that I don't think it worth half of the price. I would not buy it if I had seen the real thing. It is too light even for my son to push it. I think the unrealistic of the whole package has turned him off. He doesn't play with it at all. A total disappointment.
2,Very Disappointing,"The biggest disappointment (among many) about this toy is that the items that go in the cart are so small that they do not even cover the bottom of the cart if all laid down flat. In the picture, the cart is overflowing with groceries. I realize it says that items may vary from what is shown in the picture, but it says due to ""constant improvement"" insinuating that what you get may actually be better than what you see. What a joke! Furthermore, the fake money looked like it was printed off from a home computer and had to be cut apart by hand, no perforation or anything...same for the ""coupons"" and ""shopping list"" that came with it. In addition, the seat for a doll is not big enough for any doll I've ever seen. It's barely big enough for a Beanie Baby stuffed animal. It is also mostly plastic, not metal like the advertisement insinuated. If you are looking for a shopping cart for your toddler, keep looking. This is not a good value."
2,Pretty flimsy,"I almost wonder if some of the earlier reviews are of a different product. The one I just assembled is pretty flimsy. Be aware that although the description says ""metal frame"", the basket itself is plastic. It hangs off of the frame by just two plastic clips. I am not sure how well it's going to hold up to my toddlers' play but I suspect they are going to pull it apart in short order. It's cute but I wish I'd paid about half of what I did for it (which, incidentally, is about half of what it's currently listed for on here)."
1,"Wobbly, not worth its money",This shopping cart is not very sturdy - VERY wobbly!! It is VERY small and won't hold much food. The 'seat' for doll would not hold most dolls it is VERY small - maybe a weibkin. It arrived with VERY small pretend food (not as pictured) and no money/coupons/or list as promised. I would NOT buy this item again --- buy a sturdier one that will last!!
2,Less than Satisfied,From the way that the picture looked I thought that the basket would be made from the same metal material that the bottom is made of. It is not! This makes the entire toy extremely flimsy. I would not recommend this particular shopping cart to anyone.
1,cheap junk,This thing is crap. Looks much better on the picture then in real life. Light weight plastic junk. Don't buy.
2,"Flimsy, flimsy, flimsy","I was so excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas. However, I was so disappointed when we put it together. It is really flimsy and poorly made. The cart actually bends when my kids walk with it. The money and products that come with it are also very uder-whelming. I would not purchase this product again."
1,"missing part, can't find a replacement","I bought this item at my local grocery store for half price. Problem is that it was missing a part, one side of the wheels! It's just laying in my playroom for a year. We can't use it until I find a replacement part. And it's pretty flimsy. the doll seat only moves about 2 inches back. the doll will need to be pretty small."
3,Small fun,"This is alot smaller than its visual and measurements, but works out great for my hardwood/carpeted floor and small one-family home that is already filled to the max with toys. It compliments our small-sized corner kitchen and table area for use by our son. It has been difficult to find a cart that isn't pink or bulky. This cart is very light weight and small and not completely metal, as the description led me to believe. It was easy to assemble."
3,Just okay,"My daughter likes to fill it with toys and push it around. It wasn't difficult to put together, but I did notice that the stickers on the shopping cart (which were already on it) were already peeling off straight out of the box."
2,"Flimsy, bleh","Shopping carts are fun, but this one has terrible wheels, is flimsy, just a bunch of cheap soft plastic. Finally died on us.Do not recommend. Get the Little Tikes instead."
1,Not good,"Not sturdy, my toddler fells several times pushing the cart.not good for little kids.toy articles included are made of paper and everybody with little kids knows that those are not going to last.we returned it and both a different one"
3,cheap,Cheap. Dont expect to get a sturdy cart. My boy is so rough with things that it broke the first day but it served its purpose! He still loves pushing it around.
2,Tired of FIXING IT!,"My 2 year old LOVES this toy- us, not so much. YOU assemble it in the first place (snaps together.) Very cheaply made, falls/comes apart all the time, wheels jam, tips over because it has NO weight to it. (Can't tell you the number of times my little guy has ended up doing a faceplant/buttplant on the floor!) We finally let him take it outside to beat the ""whooha"" out of it so we can buy one more substancial. Don't waste your money- buy one that looks heavier and hefty."
1,Not Pleased,"I was not pleased with this item at all.It was not durable at all for the price.I do not usally comment on products but the quality of this was so poor I would like to prevent someone else from wasting their money.I bought two for my twin grandaughters and one was bent within a week of giving it to them,that you could no longer push it.They did love them though,just wish they were made better.Small World Toys Living Toys Shop 'N' Go Shopping Cart"
4,son loved it but kind of flimsy,Both of my sons loved this toy and used it for everything from shopping to pretending it was a garbage truck! It lasted longer than I expected but eventually became bent and came apart. Very lightweight and easily bent.
3,As Funny as it Gets?,This was supposed to be a comedy. I would call it a light-hearted drama. Jack Nicholson was the same as he was in Batman and Terms of Endearment - a one-trick pony. Helen Hunt was both beautiful and convincing in her role.
4,An smart charming comedy.,"When a nasty obessive-compulsive writer (Jack Nicholson in a Oscar Winning Performance) and he lacks emotional, feeling and love until he meets an attractive Waitress (Helen Hunt in a Oscar Winning Performance) changes his life slowly with the help of his gay Neighbor (Greg Kinner in a Oscar Nominated Role) and also his adorably ugly dog.Directed by James L. Brooks (Co-Creator of The Simpsons) brings a smart entertaining comedy about Changing and Falling in Love for the first time. This is Nicholson's Third Winning Role. This was also One of the Biggest Box Office Hits of 1997. This film is a fine surprisngly well made dramatic comedy. Grade:A-."
5,out of the dark,"After Jack Nicholson's numerous roles in dark movies, this black comedy really took him back into the new movie business, his acting as an absessive compulsive person, with a waitress, Helen Hunt, by his side on his journey through a rough patch.Magnificant, in every way."
5,As good as it gets,I have watched this movie so much that I am now on my 2nd DVD. So much comedy and an awesome cast.
4,"Not bad, but not terrific either.","The only thing this movie had going for it was Helen Hunt. She was great. It was like she wasn't acting. She really looked like a working siongle mom. Absolutely did not like Jack Nicholson, all he did was swagger. All he ever does now is charm and swagger his way through a movie. He doesn't act anymore. The script wasn't bad, but it was nothing compared to Terms of Endearment."
5,Fav,This is one of my all time fav movies funny touching and shows what love can do....even to a hard person
5,"Very Good, Very Romantic and Very Funny as it gets.","In my opinion, this is the second movie of Nicholson since One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest which he deserves his 1997 Oscar for Best Actor. Helen Hunt is also pretty but strong. The trip of Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear who plays the role as a gay artist is the most impressive and outstanding point of the movie. One of my 'MUST-SEE' comedy films."
5,This IS as good as it gets!,"The best romantic comedy to come along in years! It was absolutely wonderful, with smart jokes and inteligent dialogue. With such a wide diversity of characters, it made you enjoy every one of them. Unlike other movies, particularly most action movies, these characters seemed realistic, themselves, and overall enjoyable. The actors fit their parts well. Jack Nicholson was absolutely hilarious and enjoyable. Helen Hunt was at her top-notch best and fit her role perfectly. I've never seen Greg Kinnear so into his role, and I'm surprised that Cuba Gooding, Jr. wasn't nominated for another Oscar. That guy is so funny. This is the must-see movie of the nineties! Great fun and great laughs."
2,pretty boring........yup........boring........(snore),"I watched this movie twice. Both times it sucked. I thought maybe if I watched it a second time, I would have better luck, but no. The first time I wanted to watch this movie bc I thought it was about the dog (who I could spoil all day!!!!). I don't even think it played too much of a role in that movie. There are a couple things I liked about this movie. Jack Nicholson's acting was nothing less than supurb. The dog was the best thing in the movie. I also liked the one line of the movie (as said in the title) 'What if this as good as it gets?'it was a shock of realism there and i liked that. Also, I loved the gay guy. He was...eh.....kinda funny..... I had to sit through everything else. If all that u wanta see Jack Nicholson in 'one of his best preformances' than u should get this movie. If not, don't waste good money on it."
5,You Down With OCD? Oh Yeah That's Me!,"There's a lotta bruthas out there flakin an perpetratin but scared to kick reality. This particular playa (Jack Nicholson) got the OCD chronic, yo. But what interests this G is that one of the main symptoms of OCD is recurrent, abhorrent, anxiety-provoking thoughts of doing violence to those close to you - i.e. poppin a cap in your homies, though you think this sort of thing is to-the-curb. Which is exactly what Jack Nicholson had going on in The Shining. The intrusive unacceptable thoughts are what motivate the ritualistic behaviors. In The Shining, Jack had the bad ideas, in As Good as it Gets, he's got the rituals. If you could somehow combine these two movies in your mind, you'd get a complete picture of Nicholson's mental illness."
1,Ho-Hum,"If you enjoy watching conversations between your grandparents and their friends, this movie it is for you. In 62 years of movie watching I can honestly say this is the most boring movie ever made. You will first be bored by watching the commercials that you have just paid to see. The writer of this, ""worst of Jack Nicholson"", fiasco did us a favor by allowing us to watch the first 2 minutes that is the entire movie. The balance of which is the same as those first 2 minutes. Save your money or buy Enron stock, the entertainment is far better."
5,Rosie31962,"""THIS MOVIE IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS""This Movie Is One Of My All Time Favorites And I Enjoy It And This Is A Movie You Must Have For Your Video Libary. It's One Of Those Movie You'll Never Get Tire Of And It Really Is As Good As It Gets For The Motion Picture Buiness"
4,"better than average movies, with fine performances.","This movie stars Jack Nicholson, being his usual strange, intense self, along with fine performances by Greg Kinnear (better than I thought he'd be) as a gay artist, and Helen Hunt (also not bad, but not as revealing as I thought she'd be in her ""art"" scenes with Kinnear, but it doesn't detract from her also good performance, as a waitress with a sick child) as three people looking for the answer to the question: Is this as good as it gets? Life. Except for a ""glitch"" unrelated to the movie, I enjoyed it."
3,Only OK.,"This movie did not do a lot for me. I mean, it was a really boring pointless movie. Sure, relationships did develop and the characters changed but it was really a snooze. Helen Hunt should not have won the Oscar for Best Actress that she stole from Kate Winslet. Jack did deserve, but this definately was not his best performance of his career by any standard. The movie wasn't bad, it was just OK."
1,A movie even Nicholson could not save ...,This is a slow moving and boring movie. The slowness of the movie is aggravated by the acting of Helen Hunt. Ms. Hunt goes through the movie with a woody expression. There is furniture in the picture that is more expressive than she is. So watch something else and dont bother with this one. By the way Nicholson is spectacular as usual.
3,Half as good,One of those frustrating flicks that doesn't know when to quit while it's ahead. I tend to switch off just before they hit the road. It lacks the ruthless discipline of vintage Neil Simon.
4,human transformation,I like the transformation process. How a woman could change a person. Make so much difference in a person.
1,"Terrible, predictable fluff","This, along with ""The Matrix,"" provided two of the least enjoyable movies that I can remember sitting through. The story was very predictable, and tediously told. Avoid this unless you only enjoy the very lightest of fluff."
2,Go figure,"Mentally ill dirty old man leers after vunerable young woman with cute ill son and finds a kind of redemtion helping a cute gay guy who doesn't seem very gay.This is one of those movies that I watch and just go ""huh?"". Jack Nickolson.. yeah... Col. ""You can't handle the truth!"" plays a romance writer who apparently loathes women. And women buy his books. Yeah. It is one of those contrivances that writers pitch in Spago after two martinis. Greg Kinnear is sweet as one of the needy triad of Helen Hunt and her son ... but come on. Are we so desperate to see A list actors that we'll watch them in a C quality movies? Enough already. The end of the movie gives the viewer a crawly feeling... Helen Hunt is so driven to desperation by her insurance company and her son's medical bills that she'll even do it with a guy as old and dissapated as Jack Nickolson. Stop! Stop! Ewww!"
3,"I'd agree with the ""overrated"" review, but let me elaborate","I recall reading something someone had said about Jack Nicholson. He said that Nicholson was a terrible actor, because he is the way he is on screen in real life. This makes sense now, given all his roles are the same person. I suppose you just need to find a story that matches you so you get awards for being yourself. (?)Why this movie won so many awards is beyond me. The acting is mediocre, and the story was very annoying. I was in a very lovey-dovey mood when I watched this, but when I stopped... I was more angry than anything because the movie didn't end quick enough. This was supposed to be a romantic comedy. I'm not a huge fan of Helen Hunt, so I suppose that didn't help... but the overriding thought throughout was, ""please end. why won't this end?""I know... sad.Go get You've Got Mail if you want a good romantic comedy."
5,"Really Funny Comedy, Sparkling Performances!","This is one of the best comedies of the 90's. It is extremely entertaining and features perfect performances by an all-star cast. Jack Nicholson really shines as Melvin Udall, a role he was born to play. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are also brilliant as Carol the waitress and Simon the f@g, respectively. James L. Brooks manages to write a refreshingly funny screenplay with perfectly drawn characters. It has some great insights on what lonelyness can do to a man and how relationships with other people can change your life. Extremely entertaining comedy. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
5,Nicholson at his very best,"Nicholson starts out as such a miseable human being, along the way he learns tolerance, love and compassion. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear add to the magic with the touching scene at the motel when she takes a bath. Wonderful, a real treat for intelligent people."
5,A perfect role for Jack Nicholson,"If you want to see Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances, showcasing the craft at its best, then you have to see As Good As It Gets. Nicholson plays a grouchy writer with some strange habits ... he's a germ freak. And while the story isn't about anything exceptional, except for ""usual"" circumstances in life, the characters are highly interesting, especially Nicholson's and Kinnear's characters. It's just a joy to watch great acting in this cute little story, and to relax as you watch this 2+ hour comedy. Helen Hunt is also doing a great job and she fits well into this triangle. You'll enjoy it!"
5,Awesome,Downloaded it from Amazon dvd section. Download was a little confusing and it is not easy to find your videos that you have purchased. Itunes is much more user friendly.
4,You Can Find Romance With The Most Unlikeliest Person,"This is a very sweet movie about a man. Who does not connect with other people well.All though it does fall into the humor gender. There is a lot more in the story then that.I don't usually like romance stories. However, this one is very good. I recommend it to any one who likes a romance movie with a little more things thrown in."
5,The title says everything,"Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding Jr and Greg Kennear are phenomenal in this classic masterpiece of a man's journey to find love. 100% entertainment and pure gold, academy award and golden globe winner, this movie is great. 10/10."
2,How Helen Hunt got best actress for this is beyond me,"Jack Nicholson delivered an amazing performance, as always, but this film was absolutely ruined by Helen Hunt. Doesn't anybody find her incredibly irritating? I can't put my finger on it. Maybe its her voice, or demeanor. I don't know. But I can't stand her."
5,Do yourself a favour!,"Do yourself a favour and if you haven't already seen this movie, get it - watch it - and thoroughly enjoy it. It's by far one of the best movies I've ever watched. Helen Hunt is amazing, Jack Nicholson is great, and Greg Kinear is tops as well. It's worth alot more than five stars!"
2,Did not like it at all,"I must admit I hated this film. I sensed absolutely no chemistry between Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson whatsoever. Nicholson played himself yet again. His racist/homophobic/anti-semetic comments weren't supposed to be funny ... or were they? Hearing the audience laugh at Nicholson's bigotry sent chills down my spine. The only saving grace of this film was the acting of Greg Kinnear. Ironically he was the only actor to not receive an award for his work in this film, but the only one who deserved it."
1,This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!,"I Thought this movie was horrible. The age difference between the two actors (Hunt and Nicholson) was too huge a gap to make an enjoyable movie. Jack's character was horribly mean and in reality, Helen's character would have never looked at him again after he said such awful things about her son. If it were possible, I would have given it 0 stars. I wouldn't recommend this movie to even my worst enemy."
1,Ugh!,"People love this movie? I usually can understand why a movie has fans, even if I do not particularly care for the movie, but this movie was horrible. Helen Hunt cannot act her way out of a wet paperbag-the worse Oscar win in history. Kinnear over-acted badly, Nicholson was in his own movie, and I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this garbage!"
1,NO,"There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is. I'm sure most of us have at some time or another laughed at the misfortunate medical circumstances of others as represented on film. But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs."
2,Disappointing,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. Nicholson and Kinnear were okay. But generally, the acting was clumsy (that Helen Hunt beat out Judy Dench in ""Mrs. Brown"" for the best actress Oscar makes me sick), the writing was really clumsy, and the direction was really REALLY clumsy. You could almost feel the camera creak on its tripod during panning shots! There is some clever stuff in it. But overall, it was a half-baked, clunky film."
2,"If this is the state of witty dialogue, we're in trouble.","There are a few (very few) amusing moments, but the overall spirit of the film is entirely flat. This represents the low point of Brooks long descent into mid-cult mediocrity. It isn't the kind of mediocrity that one can vege out in front of, though, rather its attempts to hit the target in the lowest-common denominator funny bone get increasingly grating and insulting, to the point that by the end of the movie I wanted to see the entire cast drawn & quartered, and the writer and director in stockades. Avoid at all costs."
3,Entertaining but Flawed,"I enjoyed this DVD for the most part, but I was very disappointed with Helen Hunt's acting. She was clearly mis-cast in this role & even though she apparently had countless retakes of key scenes she still could not bring herself upto the level of her co-stars. I think with a real actress in her place this could have been a real gem of a movie. I watched this DVD three or four times & it got to the point where I had to fast-forward past some of her dialogue because her ineptitude became increasingly irritating with each viewing."
2,As soggy as possible,"As doggone doggedly doggy as could be. There is some kind of unbridgeable cultural social divide between America and the rest of us when it comes to this type of material. What apparently seems so delightful and Oscar-worthy over there just strikes the Old World as incredibly yukky and fake. The extra star is for Helen Hunt, who did the best that could be done with the cringe-making script. Like someone said, Jack could have sleep-walked through this role; and I think he did. That cute little tyke looked female to me, but they kept calling it boy. Embarrassing."
1,very run of the mill,who hasn't already seen this film done oh say about 75-80 different times already?Helen Hunt is a so/so actress.nothing really special about her character.as for Jack Nicholson is he ever gonna change his style? to me he is just like the Rolling Stones.some good songs here&there but after a while everything starts all sounding the same.well that's the case with Nicholson all of his movies he plays an Arrogant Man.this is one of the many reasons why i don't watch award shows they like to much sameness.there's nothing special about this film at all.
1,As Good As It Gets,"We had this movie on an old casset, wanted a newer version. Loved it. The quality of DVD is great!"
5,a real show stopper,This movie that I have on dvd is a real show stopper.It's touchingFunnyromanticsincerestraightforwardI loved the cam angles and everything about the sets they used to filmThe locations were just marvelousEverything from the diner scenes to the apartmentNice wardrobes were picked out tooMy regards to the stylist tooCunning crafty movie.Go rent itI loved itI'm sure you willpeace
5,As Good As It Gets,"When I first saw this movie, I hated it. But I watched it today, and found out that it was actually pretty good. Helen Hunt gives the best performance in the movie, but the Oscar should still have gone to Kate Winslet for Titanic. Jack Nicholson was also good, but not quite Oscar worthy. I don't know why I hated this movie, but this time, I actually laughed. Maybe I didn't understand it the first time around. It happens, right? I found this movie to be warm, a little cold, witty, and funny. While still not the best film ever made, or not the best film of 1997, this is still not a bad movie. If you hated it the first time, give it another chance. You might like it the second time around."
5,Can't go wrong with Jack. .,"he was so funny in this movie. . the whole cast worked perfectly together. . it's a movie with a message, but also some great laughs. If you haven't seen it, this is a great movie, another must have for me."
2,disappointed,"I love Watsonville Patio's first 3 CDs (Watsonville Patio, Hotel Roselynn, population 02), so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found this CD to be boring. All the songs sound alike to me and there are no standouts, no catchy tunes. I listened to it a bunch of times to give it a chance, but my opinion did not change. Very disappointed with it."
5,Fish Bowl Review,"My mother was delighted with the bowl because it was an exact replacement for her old one. She didn't think they made these anymore. Personally, I believe the bowl is small for even one goldfish, but if you like one-gallon glass bowls in a flat shape, this is the one for you!"
2,Disappointing!,"This is a very disapponting book. It has to unifying theme, unless Semiotics is given that role. In fact, it is not a book, and doesn't read like a book. It is a disparate collection of variable level of interest, going from no interest at all, to moderately interesting. It is, to a large extent, nothing but a waste of time. My interest in semiotics as a field of intellectual endeavour wasn't sufficient to carry me through the entire thing."
4,Looks good!,"Fits snugly on a 2000 BMW Z3 2.3. Needed 2 of them, of course. Used 2 of the screws on each tip."
4,it is a great product if you dont mind the change,"the controller has a equal performance than the original controller, however a far superior quality of joystick. it is a great product as long as one doesn't mind he change of sized and positions of some things"
3,A Nicely Detailed Die Cast Miniature BUT...,"I purchased this die cast miniature of Darth Maul's Sith infiltrator a few years ago soon after it was featured in the Star Wars Episode I movie. The detailed features, the paint work, the sturdy die cast construction, and the folding wing tips are great! BUT, the legs underneath the ship are way too big and do not retract into the ship, thereby ultimately ruining the aesthetics of the whole model. It's a pity because I do still like the ship very much. I'm still searching for another die cast version of this ship...."
2,wrong named,"If ""practical"" means having a sample project with the theory, the name of this book is incorrectly named. With a big bunch of text or description, it is not ""practical""!"
4,Customer Satisfaction,The book I got was in very good condition and the time it took for delivery was also good
3,"A little too wordy for my tastes, but good","This book was pretty good. I have to admit that for the first hundred or so pages, I was feeling very impatient. All of that information could have been conveyed in about 25 pages, and been much easier to read. But there are some very good examples in here, and it is worth reading. If you are looking for something more technical, try ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"", by Christopher M. Bishop or ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman."
5,A book to understand the subject,"It's the best book I know because it explains the topics in a very didactic fashion and the book refers to a computer program easily available (Weka, from the University of Waikato of New Zealand)because is Open Source."
3,Not A Good Data Mining Book,"This book is not particularly well written. However, I thought its value might be in how to use the WEKA tool. Sadly, all it does is recycle a lot of online documentation (that is poorly written). I hope somebody will write a good WEKA book soon, because there is a big demand for it. This is sadly not the book."
2,Not particularly useful,"The material is very superficially laid out and for a book with the word ""Practical"" in the sub-title it contains almost no practical examples of data mining."
3,ITS A TARP,ITS 6 ITS 12 ITS BLUE AND ITS A TARP. SO IT IS IN FACT A 6 BY 12 BLUE TARP AS ADVERTISED.
2,FIne with me but hubby hates it,"I needed something that didn't SLAM every time you raised/lowered the lid. It's a little weird to sit on, but I was willing to get used to it. My husband hated it! Fortunately, I was able to find inexpensive, ""no slam"" toilet lids at my local hardware store. We weren't interested in the padding, just cutting down on the noise. In conclusion, we're not using this product anymore."
1,A systematically misleading book,"In this popularization of his prodigious body of academic work, leading Jewish Studies figure Jacob Neusner presents his philosophy of the Mishnah. Unfortunately, what he presents is an unrealistic account of the Mishnah and its world-view. Neusner force-fits the Mishnah into his own tendentious views of Rabbinic Judaism as a harsh and callous system, bent on enforcing unrealistically perfectionistic halachic minutiae and on exacting strict justice on those who fail to meet this standard. Selective interpretation of the Mishnah, using quotes out of context, and ignoring essential commentary provided by the Gemara and other sources leads to Neusner's systematically misleading picture of not only the Mishnah but of Judaism itself."
2,Just a so-so text,"This book was given to me; it is a decent reference text/atlas with some good color illustrations; however, I believe that another text -- Recognizable patterns of human malformation: genetic, embryologic, and clinical aspects by David W. Smith -- is far superior. I very much recommend the Smith text over the Spitz text. Although Recognizable patterns of human malformation does not have color illustrations, it is much more comprehensive, easier to read (in my opinion), and cheaper ($65)."
2,"Nice try, Farylrobin","The design of these shoes is so pretty, especially the thin ankle strap and toe cleavage in the front. However, they are so poorly made and therefore look so cheesy that it spoils the overall attractive design.Even though they are not that expensive, they are still way overpriced considering that the quality is so inferior."
5,An excellent reference guide,This is an essential book for the beginner or experienced photographer. Mr Coe provides good advice that helped me improve my photography. He uses examples of badly taken photos (we all take them) and shows how you can use simple ways to improve and turn your pictures into ones that would make even the top professional proud. The author has teaching down to a fine art.
1,Not what I thought,I went into this thinking that it would be a nice techno/trance CD. I was wrong...very wrong. This is nothing more then hard driving drum machine and not much more. I say stay away from this 0ne.
5,Insanely funny!,Meet Horse Badorties and travel with him on his picaresque wanderings through lower New York City. He's Tom Sawyer on acid
1,Virtually unreadable. Garbage.,"I found the continuing use of the word ""man"" To be distracting. Acually, I hated this book."
2,A strangle little book,"I've read other books by this author and liked them, especially ""The Bear Went Over the Mountain."" Perhaps I didn't read the emailed Amazon promo carefully enough because I had no idea that this book was written 35 years ago. It is a story of a druggie living in NYC in the '60s. Although I was part of that culture, I really didn't know anyone as deeply into weed as this character so it was hard to relate. Was the story supposed to be happy, funny, or just sad? It was hard to tell. And how DID the chorus get all those fans?"
1,Misleading Page,"I just got a remanufactured cartridge instead of a new, HP-made one. See comments from others. My complaint is that Amazon allows at least this seller to post a misleading product description. The weasel word which they use to cover their tracks is ""replacement."" This hardly connotes ""remanufactured.""Amazon needs to police its 30-rd party sellers far more vigorously. I don't blame the 3rd party, I blame Amazon."
2,"Black Market, Grey Goods","The box I received was that of international marketing (Grey Goods), this is typically only sold outside the USA.I was never informed of this when I made the purchase. The box has very little English on it.Buyer beware."
2,dissapointed,"Disappointed to find that there was powder ink all over the cartridge when we recieved it today. It was a mess, we did however still use it and hope that I have not spent my teacher funds in vain."
3,Not in OEM box,"The printer toner cartridge was not in the OEM HP retail carton, just a bulk plain cardboard box. It did not have the prepaid shipping label that HP provides for recycling the old toner cartridge. I was disappointed."
1,Not genuine but a remanufactured cartridge,"Nowhere in the product listing is it stated that this is a used cartridge that has been drilled and refilled and repackaged. The toner cartridge I received was an ""Office Depot"" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.If I wanted a refilled used laser toner cartridge I would have bought one and at a much lower cost than this one is selling at - hence my surprise to see I was sent a refilled cartridge."
4,Skeptical--but,"I was really skeptical of the whole thing, I had never tried hypnosis until I was having problems sleeping. I tried this one about a week and a half before my next exam and listened to it at lest every other day. I went from getting a 30 because I was so nervous and frozen in fear of the exam to an 80! well, I also studied, but I had studied the time before as well. All of the shakes I had problems with and mind blocks went away!what was most helpful to me (consciously) was definitely that he repeated my subconscious never forgets. it really calmed me down at any rate.I did think the music was a little corny, but it definitely woke me up at the end."
5,green cane,I love this cane . I use it all the timeand I have other canes but this one has a nice grip.
5,wonderful,"I waited too long to purchase a cane. I'm 35, have rheumatoid arthritis, and finally realized I needed a cane on July 4th. I could have participated more in all the fun had I had one sooner. I just received this cane today and am very happy with it. I took a walk with my daughter around the block and it works great. I was able to move quickly and confidently. The cane is light weight, easy to use and looks nice. The handle is wonderful, it stays when I hook it on the counter. Now I can do dishes and still keep my cane ready to use. The height is easily adjustable for my hands. I recommend this cane and encourage anyone who might need a cane to not hesitate in purchasing this one. Buy one sooner rather than later, you can enjoy more life that way."
3,Carex Canes.,"Remember the add is deceiving it is not two(2) canes only one(1)! I was attracted to the advertisement because it stated two canes and red, however I didnot receive 2 canes. I had to order a second cane since I need to use two canes at a time. All of the other Carex Canes I purchased scratched easily. I have dropped them on soil and cement when my grip is unsteady and they were visibly scratched. The ruby red canes arenot totally red they have a flower pattern on them. The canes last longer than the coloring on them. The canes support my full figure however the cushion grip could be more comfortable. I have many Carex Canes because they are affordable, each one have different grips some more comfortable than others."
4,"Cane is great, price too high","The cane is working out perfectly for my Mom whose scheduled for knee surgery. However, the bronze cane was more expensive than other colors and subsequently have seen all 3 colors of this cane available in drug stores for same price and $2 cheaper than Amazon.(exclusive of shipping cost.)"
2,Good cane BUT...,"This is a good cane and would get 5 stars from me but it's impossible to get the instruction packet off the cane without a sharp knife which will either scratch the finish on the cane or cut your hand, or both. I managed to do both. No excuse to attach this packet to the cane with very tight plastic zip ties."
2,Book,"The book arrived on time and looked to be in ""good"" condition on the outside. Once I began reading the book I found that several pages were missing throughout."
3,Woody Medium Scent,"Scents and perfumes are obviously a very subjective experience. For my tastes I just don't care for this perfume that much. My first reaction when I smelled this perfume is woody - so the product description is pretty accurate. Oriental isn't a bad way to describe the scent either although I wouldn't have thought of that without seeing it on the product description. It's in the middle range of strength, which is a plus. But for some reason it just doesn't do much for me."
4,"Works as promised, But quality is lacking.",I received it in a short period of time. When I opened it it was what I needed. The tip is a bit off center so if you are using a drill or electric screw driver it is wobbly. But it seems to have a tight fit and as long as I dont use it alot I should have it a while. Im not expecting a whole lot out of a bit I paid so little for.
2,Prison Break-Interference (Bonus Content),"was hoping for a little more; guess this is what one gets for looking for something free. if you want me to purchase a episode, you will have to part with more than 2 minutes of a teaser"
5,Rockin',"This cd is fun! The lyrics are witty and I find myself wanting to sing along with them. Also, the beats are groovy and I like the variety of songs and to sum it up I really have fun listening to this cd. It's definitely worth purchasing!"
3,"Not the worst, not the best.","A general overview of VBScript. Definately not the best book. If you are used to books like Professional Active Server Pages (Wrox) or JavaScript for the World Wide Web (Peachpit Press), you will be sorely disappointed by this book. One good thing about it is that it gives review questions at the end of every chapter, which I liked, but as far as information goes, it is not the best."
3,"Good for starters, not so much otherwise.","This is a good GPS for navigating a straight line between two points, but not much else.This GPS is rather primitive and not very intuitive in its design.I used it for a few days, but then the novelty wore off and I realized that I'm going to have to cough up some more money for a better unit."
2,not so good,"I am from Montana, along the Yellowstone. I think I was more than ready to like this film BUT found it lame and disappointing. I tried turning the sound off because the commentary was so bad."
4,Great!,"A fun calendar with great patterns. of course, you are not supposed to KNIT one every day (that would be ridiculous!) . Several patterns are reminicent of last year's book."
2,Ummmm... not so much.,"A pattern-a-day knitting calendar is a nice idea, but the reality is that most of the patterns will be either thrown in a file somewhere or simply dropped in the trash; very few knitters are able to keep up with this much work, and even fewer would have any desire to. The main problem with this calendar is that many of the patterns are relatively unattractive (witness the goofy hat they decided to use for the box cover; it might be better with different yarn colors, but still....) Don't buy this for your mother or grandmother unless you want to be the proud winner of a bunch of goofy knitted garments that they'll be sure you'll like (""But my desk calendar said it was 'groovy'!"")Get a joke-a-day, word-a-day, sudoku-a-day or cartoon-a-day calendar instead, you'll be glad you did, for so many reasons."
2,Skip,I usually like calenders that give me something to think about or to do. Most of the patterns on this calender are useless. It is easy to tell that most of the items were already patterns found on the internet that you could get for free or they were patterns that were quickly made up. I don't think there is much thought put into them.
4,Butcher Block Finish,"This product worked as promissed, but you may want to consider a beeswax product. Traditional mineral oil doesn't repel water as well as beeswax."
4,Laughs Ahoy!,"Okay, sorry about the cheesy review title, but as my friend, Herm Melville said, this is the best ""guy-tries-to-get-revenge-against-a-whale book"" published in 155 years. So I got carried away.Our Story: Gus Openshaw is a cannery worker/blogger who has never read MOBY DICK. He is seeking revenge against the darned whale that ate his right arm and his family, and Gus relates his tale in the form of a blog recounting his battles with the elements, mutineers, and litigators.The plot's not just an excuse to trot out absurd action and boisterous humor, although it does that too. It's actually a pretty ingenious maritime story, and it ends up doing comic takes on a multitude of genres. Plus, it has pictures!Extra Credit for the remote controlled giant squid robot. This book was funny enough for me to search out Thomson's previous novel. If it's only 5/6ths as funny as this one, it will be worth the effort."
3,A thought is just a thought,"Excellent book for introducing treatment for OCD looks at medication and psychological treatment from a ""childs""perspective. I used this as homework reading for my clients (children).American slant but ok for Australians."
2,Not worth the price,"If you are completely clueless about your options, then flip through this book at the library for ideas. Information is minimal--not worth buying."
1,Piece o' crap,"You're better off saving your money and looking through the want ads. Like all books in this series, it's a thorough waste of time. Even the binding job is horrible...the pages fall out with a mere flick of the wrist."
4,You ARE there with the Eight!,"Hats off to Mr. Woodworth for putting the finishing touches on the late Mr. Wilkinson's regimental history of this fighting unit. The diary, journal and newspaper accounts of the period allow a true ""you are there"" experience for the reader - and all are woven nearly seamlessly to offer a vivid text for the scholar or casual reader. A bit annoying, though, are the lack of ANY maps! A definate ""recommend"" from this Civil War enthusiast!"
3,"Good, but limited analysis","Riker's work has become a classic in political science. His ""heresthetic art"" essentially means that politicians structure the choices available to suit their desires and preffered outcomes. While this should not shock anyone, Riker does provide examples where politicians did this that may surprise those unfamiliar with the legislative process.This book has limited applicability, however, due to its rational-choice assumptions. Riker assumed that people will react rationally to the choices they are presented with; however, knowing that some politicians are trying to manipulate the system, won't others try and do the same thing? What prevents them from succeeding; or, in other words, why do some people win while others lose?Riker can't explain many political outcomes in which both sides act strategically to suit their own goals. He leaves out the crucial role that institutions play in shaping political outcomes, and thus his analysis is incomplete."
5,"Go, Michael!","Every year, Christmas is not Christmas until I hear Michael Crawford's O Holy Night on the radio. I actually collect versions of this song and Michael's is far and away the best. When he's gearing up for THAT note at the end, I usually find myself going 70mph down the road, going ""Come on, Michael! Bring it on home, baby! Do it NOW!"" And he does. Oh yes, he does.You'll have to pull over. I'm telling you."
5,Goose-Bump Time,"Most Christmas music enthusiasts will not like everything on this disc, but if Michael Crawford's presentation of ""O Holy Night"" does not give them goose bumps, there's something wrong with them. I do not especially like this song, but Crawford's performance is worth the price of the disc -- and then some. Interestingly, Crawford's ""O Holy Night"" is also featured on the Trans-Siberian Orchestra DVD ""Ghosts of Christmas Eve,"" though it is quite a contrast to TSO's usual fare. This is not to say that ""O Holy Night"" is the only worthwhile track. A number of others are quite good. It's just that this version of ""O Holy Night"" is so powerful that everything else pales by comparison."
3,A Christmas Album,"The plastic case arrived cracked, but the CD itself was okay. The content was mediocre; not what I was expecting. There is only one song which I bought the CD for that I play on a regular basis."
5,Michael hits another home run,His truly incredible voice lends itself beautifully to Christmas carols. Each person who cherishes Christmas music should own this CD.
5,Beautiful music for Christmas and all year,"Wonderful album for all ages. I bought it because it has ""Mary Do You Know?""-the best version I have heard. The albumhas many other relaxing and inspiring songs,some I had never heard but then loved.I listen to and enjoy the album all year."
5,The Angel of Music Sings Again!,"Whether he is enchanting you from behind a dressing room mirror, or from your cd player, Michael Crawford is undoubtedly the most ""angelic"" voice of the decade. Who better than the angel of music to deliver for the holidays a beautiful collection of Christmas hymns that we all know and love?"
5,Michael has done it again!,"As usual, with Michael Crawford, what you see/hear is what you get: ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!! This will be a classic!"
3,"too much background ""noise""",I just wanted Michael Crawford singing Christmas carols not all the background music and backup singers. too much of a production (formal) for my taste.I love Michael Crawford but I didn't like this CD and I won't play it again.
2,"Wow, what a shocker!","Boy how could an album that possess what I feel is the world's best version ever recorded of ""O Holy Night"" not do anything for me after that? It sounds as if Michael held back on all the other songs. Maybe my hopes were too high, my suggestion, down load the single and save the money to purchase the Phantom of the Opera, a 10++."
5,A Holiday Treat,"My whole family loves this cd. It is easy to listen to and the arrangements are lovely. The only negative would be the crack in his voice in ""O Holy Night"" - very distracting. Still our new favorite though."
5,No One's Better Than Michael,"I bought this CD for one song - ""O Holy Night."" In my opinion, there is absolutely NO ONE - not even Josh Groban - that can touch Michael Crawford's performance of this beautiful song. No one in my house or car is allowed to even speak when this song is playing, and I must play it more than once...The rest of the album is a glorious potpourri of carols (A Journey To Bethlehem), hymns (Peace, Peace/Silent Night), and touching holiday melodies (Scarlet Ribbons), all wrapped up in the velvet warmth of Michael's voice. We always have this playing when decorating our tree; Christmas wouldn't be the same without it."
3,"Nice voice, not OVER THE TOP","Well, I bought this Christmas Album thinking I was getting a particular song I heard on the radio. Turns out it wasn't the one, so I'm a little disappointed. Over all, it's ok, but I'm not going to buy any others by Michael Crawford."
2,The Phantom Does Christmas,"This is NOT a Christmas album, per se, so much as a Phantom of the Opera/ Michael Crawford album. While I like the Phantom album and another Crawford album I own, this one is so full of Crawford's thoroughly affected whispered words and ""soaring"" vocals that it completely overwhelms the songs he is performing. On ""Candlelight Carol"", for example, the best part is when Crawford stops and lets the choir sing. Only then can I fully pay attention to and enjoy the tune. ""O Holy Night"" sounds like it was arranged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Frank Wildhorn together: what ought to be a beautiful, pristine melody sounds like a Broadway finale with layers of instruments, synthesizers, chorus, and full-blast Michael Crawford. It's just too overblown. Crawford should have kept the Phantom locked in the dungeon."
2,"Over the top Crawford, but nice anyway","More acting than music, this is more of a production than what I generally want from a Christmas CD. In fact, to me the pageantry overwhelms and diminishes the beauty of the music. But, Crawford fans will enjoy the Webber-like soaring crescendos and hanging whispers that add (melo)drama to well-known classics."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"THIS IS A SIMPLY WRITTEN, NICELY ILLUSTRATED BOOK WITH AN OBVIOUS ANTI-SOUTHERN AGENDA; PERFECT FOR THOSE LIVING NORTH OF THE MASON-DIXON LINE."
3,Very simplistic,"If you need a cheap-ish Civil War book for your 10-year-old buff, this may be the one. It's simple, easy to read, doesn't contain overwhelming inaccuracies, and has lots of pictures. I wouldn't really recommend it for adult scholars. It's a decent quick reference but is so short and lacking in either detail or gripping writing that many people won't find it very useful."
1,Defective,"Amazon won't let me give this ""zero stars."" We got the toy for Christmas, and it's defective -- when the toy lands on ""Cow,"" it says, ""Dog""! We didn't get a receipt and don't know what store it came from, so it was a sad waste of money from a well-meaning relative. Don't make the same mistake!"
2,Not impressed,"My daughter got this ""CD player"" for her birthday. It plays some cheesy renditions of nursery rhyme songs, but the only thing my daughter wants it to do is make the power drill sound that it makes when you push the big button on the front. Very annoying!"
3,For younger kids,I wouldn't go so far as to say that kids 36 months old will still enjoy this toy. I would put the ranges 6-18 months on it. It is cute and my son enjoyed the music and spinning but outgrew it fast.
5,Lots of fun!,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was 6 months old. She has played with it ever since. Although this player DOES NOT play CDs, it does play different songs when the big button is pushed. My daughter can easily push the button, and enjoys the lights and sounds it makes. This is definitely a favorite!"
4,Cute and fun toy!,"My baby was scared of this the first time the CD spun around but once she figured out that music came after it, she loved it. She likes watching the blinking lights too. The songs aren't too annoying (although there's a weird version of Baa Baa Black Sheep that drives me crazy) and there is adjustable volume. I'd say it's worth the money."
2,Fun but short life,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift. She absolutely loved it, but within 3 months the push button in the middle stopped working, so you had to turn the CD by hand if you wanted to use it. We kept it around because she liked it, but just recently when we turned it on the sounds were all garbled, we changed the batteries to make sure that wasn't it and it was still garbled. My daughter has had this toy for about 8 months now and it is the worst I have seen. The quality is not worth the price. I am sad to see that my brother paid so much for a toy of poor quality. I would have to say buyer beware with this toy."
2,kid loved it until it broke!,"my 1 year old daughter loved this toy, she would press the botton to make the disc spin and then dance to the music. The music is okay, not annoying like most noisy toys. But after a month or two of rough play it no longer spins. It will still play the music and if you move the wheel by hand I can select the different songs, but my daughter doesn't play with it anymore she has totally lost interest in it since it broke. I guess she liked to watch it spin and light up. I haven't called Fisher Price to complain about it yet, but I should--they have been good about making amends for other products that have been faulty."
3,fun for a while,"My little one got this as a Christmas gift (9 months old). He really enjoyed it at first. The ""cd"" would stick and less than 6 months later the button doesn't spin it at all. It was fun while it lasted. He really liked carrying it around! It just wasn't durable enough."
5,Great Fun,I got this for my daughter at only a few months of age. At first we just pressed the button for her until she started doing it herself. She has a lot of fun spinning the wheel and the rhyming songs are fun to sing to her. A must have!
5,Entertaining,"My 3 month old loves this toy.Although he can't make it work himself yet, he loves the sounds and flashing lights, and it keeps him entertained for a long time."
4,Fun Toy!,"My daughter started playing with this toy when she was 6 months old. She loves pushing the button and making the CD spin around! She is now 9 months old, and still enjoys it. She has thrown it, dropped it and held the CD down so it couldn't spin many, many times, and it still works and looks just like new! It is very durable. Fun toy, worth the price!"
1,False advertising,"If this is a CD player, then my kid's See-and-Say is a record player. This doesn't play CD's - it just has a spinning plastic disc with pictures. I was rather dissappointed with this purchase..."
3,Easy and Not Interesting,"At first, my son loved this toy. In fact, he liked it so much in the store, I just had to get it for him. But his interest quickly wore off once I got it home. It does teach animal sounds and sing nursery rhymes and it spins around in an ""exciting"" fashion when the ""nose"" on the front is pressed, but after the newness wore off, it now just sits on a shelf. I don't think it leaves anything to the imagination and because there's not that much to it, it is something that will quickly lose its appeal."
4,Fisher-Price Nursery Rhymes CD Player,The Fisher-Price Nursery Rhymes CD player (now an old model) is a great toy. Both of my girls had lots of good entertainment from it. It is simple to use and a fun way to learn some of the basic nursery rhyme songs.
4,Lots of fun,"Cute, solid,takes a child's abuse and still works. 3 batteries came with the purchase so it was ready to use."
5,Loves it!,We got this for my son at 5 months and he immediately could operate it. Now at 14 months it's still one of his fav's and we've only had to change the batteries once! He carries it around like a little baby-boom-box -- so funny!
2,The filter did not solve my noise problem through my TiVo.,I've been having a noise issue on the lower channels 1-13 through my TiVo Premier. Someone at TiVo suggested a low pass filter. I was hoping that this would solve the problem but after connecting it did not.
4,more solid Stanton,"Stanton Moore picks the Zeppelinesque title of III for his third solo CD, and he even covers a Led Zep song, ""When The Levee Breaks"". This CD is formatted like his others, in that it starts off funky, from ""Poison Pushy"" to ""Maple Plank"". The last three songs shift the tone, this time to a sorrowful tone with three cover songs related (indirectly) to New Orleans' Katrina disaster. The band is mostly a trio, Robert Walter plays organ and handles the bass notes (on the organ). Will Bernard plays bluesy guitar. Skerik plays sax on five of the songs. Stanton has made a lot of music with these guys in one form or the other. The CD is simply very good, it might be slightly better than ""Flyin' the Koop"". It's great acoustic funk, with well-written songs, starts, stops, syncopation, solos, and so forth."
2,The Geneva Bible was not talked about.,"The Geneva Bible should have been given time in this movie. Sadly, it was only mentioned one time. It was the most revered Bible until they stopped printing it in 1644, due to the KJV. The people of the time coming to the new world wanted nothing to do with the KJV as it was Anglican;they were still being persecuted by them,why would they want their Bible. The notes provided by the founders of the protestant faith, contained in the Geneva Bible, were of great value to the people and King James didn't like the fact that the notes condemned the so called, ""right of kings"" doctrine he held in high regard. There were also other reasons I won't get into in this review. Shame on you for not including one of the most influential Bibles in history."
1,This book is REALLY -- NOT AVAILABLE,"Just so you know, I recieved an email from Chris Klaus after contacting his secretary hoping to get this book faster.This was his response:Thanks for your interest in the book. This book was prematurely launched by a publisher before we had any kind of agreement, other than I indicated I might be interested in writing a security book. I'm currently in collaboration to co-author some other security books for next year. You should see them come out first half of next year.chrisAfter waiting almost 12 weeks for this book, its good to finally know why Amazon can't provide. Hey Amazon, how about taking care of your customers!!"
4,Just as promised,I received the book in the condition that was stated on the site!! Shipped promptly. Will use this seller in the future.
4,Pretty Good,"So far, the book is pretty good. It points out a few things one may not have known about God and money. Presents money from an accountants standpoint and shows that you can run your personal finances the same way you'd run a business. I do see this book being a useful tool in managing my personal fiances."
4,Soulful singing,"Lorraine Hunt Lieberson has a beautiful Mezzo and conveys a lot of emotion in these songs. My personal favorite was the Aria from ""Asoka's Dream"" and I loved the Mahler lieder as well. I know one review criticized her for being a little affected in rendering these, but maybe because I'm hearing them for the first time, I went with her take and did like it."
2,Not dept store quality,"I received this item in good condition and the products are of the volume described. But the perfume itself does not smell identical to the dept. store quality Escape perfume. I purchased this because I was running out of Escape and thought it was a great deal; however, the perfume is very faint and different than the original product."
5,Great deal,Love Escape!!!! Have been buying from an upscale department store at a much higher price. Got lotion too at a smaller price!!!
2,Dissapointded,"Dissapointed in this product from this vendor. Lotion was not full; missing about a quarter of its contents, and did not have time to return and ask for replacement. For the time it took to receive, due to the fact that I was not given the option to ship ups and it shipped via US Postal Service, and the fact that the body lotion was not full - was not worth saving a few dollars.Would not buy again - better off going to authorized retailer for this."
1,Very Disappointed,I received the merchandise yesterday and while I am sure it is okay the price charged me is WRONG! I am not willing to pay the $85.00 on the bill when this item was marked down on the Amazon website. I will be calling today to report this but it is disappointing that I now have to take my time to follow up your mistake.
2,At least there's sound (usually),"I bought this just because of the price, to see if I would even have to fork out more dough for Mics for my projects (and for this price, why not?) but to sell a Mic of this infernal quality that says ""Super Professional"" on the casing is just a crime against humanity.Bear in mind that it DOES usually work (from no more than about 12 feet away), but it sounds like 1930's radio (actually, 1930's radio had tiny amounts of bass, and was at least *remotely* clean - this has negative amounts of bass, and has a filthy quality to it), and should only be used if you ONLY care about capturing someone's words, with no regard to what those words will end up sounding like.Now it's a Super Professional trash ornament. Looks good, too."
1,Cheap Lapel Microphone,Hey folks - Just pass on this wireless lapel clip on microphone. It is very cheap. Mine lasted only 4 hours and then shorted out. This model is cheap for a reason - it doesn't last. Buy a better quality microphone.
4,To use with camcorder,"I brought this to use with my Canon HV30. The mic itself is working fine, but it does not work with my camcorder when plug in directly. I spent so much time to try to get it to work, and finally I got it to work. Here is the solutions:1) Plug in the lav mic receiver to your pre-amp, mixer, or receiver. In my case, I use Rolls MX56C mixer for the portable reason and it work with V9 battery.2) Connect the phone out from the pre-amp/mixer to the camcorder mic in with 1/8 jack cable. If you pre-amp or receiver does not have phone out, you can use line out. However, you need a special cable from Radio Shack to pad down the signal or whatever. The cable cost about $5 and the part# is Attenuating Cord 42-2461A."
1,Worked less than one day,"I was expecting lousy quality, but I thought it would at least work. The battery compartment wouldn't even close so I had to tape it shut. Then I got it to work and you could hear a loud buzzing sound underneath the audio. Then, the mic just stopped working all together. This was all in the span of one afternoon."
3,"Wireless mic works okay, but prone to interference!","I tried this wireless mic system four times in three months, before I switched to a 900 Mhz wireless mic system. I noticed two major problems. The batteries need to be replaced after two to three hours of operation. The receiver design isn't pro quality as the frequency drifts on the receiver and the signal get noisy when the battery voltage drops. You can make adjustments on the receiver, but the frequency still drifts.The second problem is the 170 MHz frequency, where this unit operates, is prone to interference, especially in the city. I had several intermittent interference problems that interfered with the audio, while taping several speakers. That's why I switched to a 900 Mhz wireless mic system. So far, the 900 system has worked, but only had it for a month. I kept the wireless unit as I'll use it as a backup or if I need a second wireles mic. For the cheap price, it's okay, but beware of these two problems!"
3,"Nice toy, you get what you pay for","I bought two of these just to play around with them. At $15 each, who can really complain.Do they work? Well, sort of. If you are out in the open, with a decent mic hooked into the transmitter and are no more than maybe 30 feet away, it is ok. If you are near any kind of electrical interference (lights, radios, etc), then you are going to have a mess on your hands. The mics that come with the units are really poor.The quality of the construction is pathetic, once again, but it only cost $15 though. Labels all fell off immediately. LED indicator lights may or may not work, but it does have a cool case.So, if you are doing something like recording your kids playing in the back yard, then these are great. Maybe video taping the wedding or party of a friend who has no money would work well too.It does transmit, it does receive, it costs $15."
4,The Wireless Lavalier Microphone Review,"The Wireless Lavalier Microphone System is perfect for informational interviewing and personal media management. It provides a portable option to amplified audient properties and gives the user a greater degree of movement during presentations. It can be used as a binary system, (two separate microphone systems and a small amplifier are needed)to interview your favorite personality, take testimonials or to exchange opinions with local leaders. The Wireless Lavalier makes the idea addition to any media kit."
1,Wireless Lavalier Microphone System,"This product is terrible, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Before, I purchased this, I was forwarned by others. I tried it anyway. I should have took the warnings and purchased some other wireless system ! One day, I'm going to give it to charity."
1,Save your money,"When it worked this microphone was fine for a distance of about 20 feet. It faded quickly however in under an hour. I checked the battery, thinking it was chewing up batteries. The battery still registed 9Volts? I returned the item and spent an extra hundred for another lavalier that I am happy with. The only thing this has going for it is that you can't get a better price. If it stays working - you got a deal. If not you are only out $20.00 at most. I successfully returned mine for a full refund so I lost no money. I own the Pyle 100 watt portable PA system & it is a quality product - so I don't understand the lack of quality in the lavalier."
1,Never Again,"This product was cheap plastic, like a toy, just as a few reviews had said. I should have listened, but no, I had to give it the benefit of the doubt and try it. I found it to be just as was published, no good... would never recommend it to anyone."
1,Too small to do any good,"I bought this to use in front of a class I teach, but my own voice is louder than this system. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Want to add some noise to your work?,"This will do it, static and interference, it adds it all to what ever I tried it with.Good thing it was cheap."
1,Old toner - don't buy from here,Received what looks to be the oldest box of toner I have ever seen. The instructions inside were even yellowed!! Poor toner quality (streaks the whole page).Don't buy from this vendor.
5,HP LJ Print Cartridge,"Product was received earlier than predicted. As of the date of this review cannot comment on quality as I have not installed in printer, yet. The product was delivered in good(new) condition so I do not believe there will be a problem with its quality. Will order again in the future"
1,What's Up With the HP-Packaged Toner?,"This is the SECOND ""HP retail packaging"" toner cartridge sold-as-new that we've purchased that was bad right out of the box. In both cases the drum was bad and created substantial ""ghosting"" on the printed pages.THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE AMAZON SELLER, since both packages were in original, sealed HP boxes of purportedly new toner for our 8000DN.It used to be a very bad idea to use ""refurbished, refilled"" toner cartridges even though they were much cheaper than the HP factory units. With the utter uselessness of the HP-packaged units at this point, I see no reason to pay more for toner that's unusable anyway.I wish there were a a better solution."
4,"Good product, wish there were less artificial ingredients","This has a good taste and is better than a lot of similar snacks, but I wish it had more natural and less artificial ingredients, such a flavorings. It's slightly higher caliber junk food."
3,Good Value,"These socks were good value, but the green dye bled badly when washed. And the cotton ""pills"" quite a bit on the inside. But for high boot socks you can't beat the price."
2,Guitar teaching on VHS,"Don't know how to rate this. Was trying to order a guitar BOOK, and ended up with VHS tape. My son is VERY talented on guitar, so VHS wasn't much help. It may have been my error, but I had typed in Rage Against the Machine Guitar BOOK, so thought I was getting both book and VHS. Fairly, new at ordering online, so maybe my mistake. VHS was sent immediately and do appreciate that. Actually got back online and ordered and received in book form before Chirstmas."
5,Paris Remixed,The bad reviews of this song in my opinion are the result of others with issues against Paris. I dj dance music and the mixes are pretty good.
1,gotta be a joke,"thanks to Studio technilogy almost anybody can go into the studio&make a record&with the right amount of money you can make the song halfway sound kinda legit. Paris Hilton basically is riding the groove of Blondie's "" the tide is high"" with a touch of what Gwyen Stefani is trying to do as a solo Artist&that is tie in part Madonna with other 80's Hybrid sounds&Music. Paris Hilton ain't got much musically going for her&just makes me miss Deborah Harry even more.good news is that Debroah harry is still making music. even better news will be that Paris Hilton will stay out of the studio here on out."
1,Terrible Fireplace,"The fireplace video is bright red. It does not look natural at all. They are both gas fireplaces so the logs do not burn with time. It is basically a static image, and a bad one at that.The other scenery is ok. I bought it for the fireplace, so I am not really using them."
2,Lots of room for improvement,"1. Menus are very slow, and my player many times just jumps out of the disc all together and I have to eject and reload.2. The audio is not a match to the view. The water scenes are of waves, bays, waterfalls, but the sound is all where the camera was.......waaaaay back, and all you hear is what sounds like a tiny brook.3. The views were very good pictures, and I did appreciate the wide screen"
1,Only good for a year or two,"I have been through a number of Sony DVD players, most recently this one. After a year and a half, it just quit playing all discs. Keep looking, there must be a better quality product out there."
5,Better All-Around Product Than iPod,"This is a great mp3 player. Not only is it extremely easy to use (yeah, that's right tobytoby, it's really easy to use), it has great audio quality. If you think it looks too thick you are wrong. It has a really good feel to it. If you are the type that everything has to be an incredible fashon statement go ahead and get your pretty little iPod. But if you care about quality, this mp3 player is the one to get. With features such as FM radio, recording, and much much more, the Zen Sleek Photo beats down the iPod like a sick dog. The price is great, it has a huge capacity, the brushed metal surface is very durable and does not scratch very easily, plus you are not just limited to iTunes but you have a wide selection of music services to choose from. Also the accessories are very cheap. I got a nice case for five bucks. I saw some iPod socks (you read right, socks) for the iPod for thirty dollars! The choice is yours... iPod or Zen."
3,Plastic,This knife has held up well and I have had it almost a year but the outer shell is plastic and feels kind of cheap. I also wish I had bought the one with the saw. It is nice how large the knife/blade is though.
5,Great knife,Love this knife. I use it every day. It is nice to see that some items are not made in china.
4,Take a trip to the moon,"If you have ever wondered what it would be like to go to the moon, this book will take you there. Go with Astonaut James Irwin on Apollo 15 to explore the moon. From lift off to splash down, it's like being right there on top of the massive Saturn V rocket, or having fun on the lunar rover. ""To Rule the Night"" captures in brilliant detail the beauty and awe inspiring view of seeing the earth from 250,000 miles out."
3,Good account of Apollo 15...,"3 and 1/2 stars...This is an excellent companion to Chaiken's ""Man on the Moon"" for the account of the Apollo 15 mission...Irwin confirms the relentless/intense desire of mission commander Dave Scott to ""give his all"" for science and he also honestly discusses the ""stamp"" scandal that essentially ruined this crew's chance to fly again. All the important details of the mission and Irwin's feelings about being on the moon are all covered very well as well as enough technical detail to keep the Apollo buffs (like me) happy. I realize that Irwin became a minister following his astronaut career, so it was an essential part of the story, but he spent too much time and detail discussing his religious feelings and I personally think that this detracted from the story. Good read for the general Apollo enthusiast, great for the detailed Apollo 15 review, but definetly a turn for the worse when he enters the ministry portion of the story."
2,a bootleg compilation,"This CD is just a bootleg compilation.In 2005, an official compilation was released - ""The Best Of And More""."
5,Very Helpful,For those Christians who have encoutered the different apologetic methodologies and have been left feeling quite confused and disoriented this book provides clear analysis into the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology. It presents each view fairly and it gives some very helpful insights on how these methodologies could complement each other. This book is definitely worth a fair reading and it may help other thinkers to see the possiblility of integrating these diverse systems. Highly recommended!
3,It's really a decent piece,"This cabinet seems at first as though it might be difficult to assemble but for the most part it was easy, as particle-board furniture goes. It could be sturdier--the cardboard-like backing is really the major thing that shores it up--but it's not as rickety as some similar items. The elongated foot board at the bottom keeps it from leaning forward or back.It does hold a lot of media, which was the point for me, and having storage in the doors is unique and useful although I have concerns that the weight of full doors might cause problems eventually.The locking facet is a neat addition but be sure to look over those parts closely before getting to the end, otherwise you'll end up having to backtrack as I did to make it all line up right.Aesthetically, this is a very nice item for a living room with all-black furniture, and considering what particle-board furniture costs these days, the price that I paid wasn't too bad."
3,"Not bad, but could be better",I bought this cabinet to store DVDs and Cds. The construction is pretty good for the price but I was very disappointed with the lock. It jammed up the second time I used it and had to buy a new one. I would recommend using a different lock than the one that is supplied.
2,Good CD But Not what I expected,"This was a good CD but I was surprised to find out that it's completely instrumental. The names after some of the songs (especially Amy Grant) led me to believe that various artists SUNG the songs. I was disappointed and suggest that somewhere in the advertisement it says ""instrumental""."
5,Needed for our times.,"""From her [Poland] will come forth the spark that will prepare the world for My final coming"" says Jesus to St. Faustina. ""Before the Day of Justice I am sending the Day of Mercy"". ...[B]ecause the awful day, the day of My justice is near"". Find out the theology and insights of these Words of Jesus in this book from the priests who were the saints confessors and from theologians dedicated to the Divine Mercy."
2,Be prepared to read...,"If you are interested in Theories that go on and on, this is the book for you. I was expecting more meat about the participants rather than what they were working on verbally, because it is all about verbiage. It is interesting to note how much thought went into written science in these times, but reading it was like watching paint dry... Very large volume and I would imagine, when Hubble recommended it in his book, it was to trick Grad students into buying and trying to read it."
4,Best Resistance Band Ever,I have been enjoying the resistance band every day when I exercise indoors.The weather has been so very hot and humid in my area that I have discontinuedmy exercise outside for a while. I exercise using the band twice a day and ithas helped my flabby arms see some more definition.So glad I purchased it. I did have a different resistance band but when Imoved to my new condo it was lost in transit.So glad I could purchase another band with no problem.
2,Length not as advertised,"This is a great band in terms of resistance (used in pilates and toning), but it was NOT 6ft as advertised. It measured 5'1"" -- had I known that I would've gone with something else as the extra 11"" in length would really make a difference on some of the moves.UPDATE: After returning this item because of it's length, I found a set of bands that really are 6ft+. TheStott Pilates Flex-Bands Gift Pack (Blue and Green)includes 2 bands over 6' each, perfect for pilates, arm & leg exercises."
5,Excellent band,"I bought this band for Cathe's workouts, and it has been working great. It's durable even when I stretch it to the max!"
2,Not good for Wii active,"Need a stronger band for Wii active this band is not 6ftSo it does not work good for the game Active it is about 9"" short"
3,Targets muscles effectively but breaks after about a year of use,"I like this band because I sometimes use Cathe Friedrich muscle training DVDs and she uses this same band. It works well as far as targeting muscles, but after awhile the places where you hold it start to get sticky and it eventually breaks. I've gone through three of them in the past three and a half years :( I keep replacing it because I don't know of another one that offers the same resistance that will last longer."
5,A provocative and entertaining journey of trains and film.,"Readers interested in the relationship between railroad and cinema should not look beyond Parallel Tracks, Lynne Kirby's extremely entertaining and insightful historical coverage of the how the train can be seen as a precursor to cinema. Conceptions of spectatorship, travel and suggestibililty normally associated with cinematic viewing practices are forcefully argued as inherent properties of how a passenger experiences rail travel. Perhaps a fault of the book is that it ends with the birth of sound cinema, when the whistle of the incoming train signified a new stage in cinematic representations of rail journeys, gender and identity. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in classic American silent film, westerns and rail thrillers, as well as those interested in how the railroad continues to impact on the triad of cinema, identity and modernity."
2,Up to you!,"I love Nightwish, I think they brought freshness to a metal scene that was screaming for something new. Call it goth metal, power metal whatever at the end it is very very melodic and that's exactly what I love about them.This DVD is cool for the Nightwish fans it features a extensive documentary about the band which is fun but not must have material.It also features a few songs (very good ones) from different footage in different countries but the sound is not good.So, Up to you!!"
2,great band.....bad sound,"I love Nightwish, but this DVD was not a good investment. I know that I sound lazy when I say that I don't like subtitles, but I wish that there was an English overdub option for the documentary part. It would make life a little easier. Even though I'm not happy about the subtitles, that's not my main complaint. The sound quality during the live performances is horrible. The one performance is in mono and sounds like there was a single mic, placed in the crowd , used to record it. The other performance actually utilizes surround sound but all of the low end is gone. My subwoofer was pretty much useless for both live performances. I feel bad saying such horrible things about a Nightwish DVD, but it's depressing to see such fine music be butchered like this. I hope that From Wishes to Eternity is better and I hope that the next DVD has better mic placement and better mixing work."
1,I love nightwish but...,"...this DVD sucks. are only interviews and Tarja even talks, probably because when this DVD was make, she already was the ""diva wannabe"" that is now (thanks Marcelo), only few concerts but at the end, this DVD it's only for real fans of nightwish. and only has english subtitles."
2,"Good songs, terrible sound","The sound quality in one of the concerts is terrible to say the least. Half of the audio tracks are probably recorded with a monophonic voice recorder - at least they sound like this.The band history (narrated in Finnish if I'm not mistaken) is boring. Would've put one star, but I like Nightwish and hope that their new DVD would be mastered by professionals."
3,Only for big fan,Don't buy if you want a show. The sound and the camera in the show are very poor. Not far from amateur. What is good in quality is the story of Nightwish in 2 hour 15 minutes in Finnish subtitle in english.For fan who want everything on Nightwish
3,Lackluster,"This novel inculdes an extended episode of a spacefaring alien Elvis impersonator which is supposed to be humorous, but is a dull, tedious, and overblown joke. Satirical use of Elvis, in any incarnation, is no longer funny, because it is so overused as a humorous counterpoint nowadays.Writing is crisp but uninteresting, in the face of this simplistic story."
2,unimaginative,"What a disappointment! Just some old street maps, no interpretation, no then and now photos."
2,How NOT to Transfer a Motion Picture Film to DVD!,"The technicians who did the telecine work on this DVD product should be sent back to video school. Not only is the widescreen movie framed to 4:3 (cutting off the left and right sides), but the picture is ""overscanned"" (cutting off the top and bottom portions) as well. At least 30% of the widescreen frame cannot be seen--hiding some of the subtitles. For those movie lovers interested in an absorbing European erotic thriller, may I recommend the VHS form of ""Suite 16"" distributed in Canada by Norstar Entertainment/Malofilm. Their widescreen transfer is properly done. Perhaps these Canadians can produce the DVD product sometime soon.Note: There are at least three different ""cuts"" of this film: 106 minutes (European version), 98 minutes (Canada R-rated version), 93 minutes (U.S. R-rated version)."
1,Bad luck?,"My review is bad enough very negative.The movie was just copied in VHS quality on a 'official' dvd release.Even some parts in the movie ware cut out.Maybe a a little to much of (non sexual) nudity, but later on in the movie you're able to see everything.So the cutting was with no reason. Even on our national tv we could see the normal version of this movie.Very disappointing tough, bad luck probably?"
1,techincal problems,I found it hard to watch. The movie is in a language other than English which comes as no surprise. The problem is that the subtitles are partially cut off in the lower half of the second line of dialogue. It was too difficult to determine what was happening since I don't speak the language and the subtitles were largely illegiable. I never finished the movie. This applies to the DVD version
5,"Patti Austin ""Street of Dreams""","I first bought this album on tape znd wore the tape to shreds. The Look of Love what a perfect rendition, its far better than the original. My Favorite is Calling You .... Patti Austin delivers everytime.. I probably need to purchase an extra copy of this as I know I will wear it out....Enjoy....."
5,It just gets Better with time,"After ""In and Out Of Love"" I figured Patti wouldn't be able to top it. Well she matched and then some for sure. This album is another great mood setter and will quickly become one of your favorites. My 15 year old Niece-""Miss Backstreet Boys"" herself asks to play this when she comes over. This is another keeper from Ms. Austin. Buy it before it goes out of print."
2,A bit thin,"I bought this because I couldn't find my fleece scarf that keeps me warm. I bought the grey and it looked nice but it was just surprisingly thin. It almost felt like if I pulled hard enough it would separate and create a hole of some sort. Luckily, I found my fleece scarf so I no longer need this one. The thing is, it has got to be cold outside for me to think about wearing a scarf in the first place. If it is cold enough that I will put up with the inherent hassle of wearing a scarf, then this scarf just doesn't have the warm factor that would make me think, ""hey let me choose the grey scarf today now that it is cold."" I gave it two stars because if I lose my fleece scarf again, I can wear this scarf and block out some chill. Also, it is soft."
3,"Easy to use, but too light on the harness","I bought this as an extra stroller to keep in my car. I wanted a lightweight, simple-to-operate stroller that I could use when I was running errands, etc. I bought it because it seemed to fit my needs and the price was right (considering I already owned other, more ""heavy-duty"" strollers).It was very easy to use, was lightweight and easily fit in my trunk. The real problem was that the harness was just a belt around my son's waist (and through his legs). It did not provide the type of restraint needed for my 16-month old wiggleworm! If your child is less energetic/curious than mine, it might be OK, but unfortunately I'm going to need to buy a different stroller with a 5-point harness."
2,"I really wanted to like this stroller, but 3 point harness? No way.","I ordered this stroller because of the reviews saying that taller people could use it well. The price was right, the color was right. I was really excited.The minute that I put my 19-month-old into it, I was really unimpressed with the harness. It was so cheap. It also barely fit him without falling out.Then we went rolling. He totally got out of the straps.Maybe this would work for younger babies, but not for toddlers."
4,Alright.,"I only use this for travel as you need an umbrella type stroller for airplanes carry-on and we travel across the country twice a year. It works well, way better than the cheap one I had from target anyway first that broke on the trip. I like that the handles are higher so you can push without bending over but it is hard to open and close it, you need two free hands to do so and with 3 kids traveling alone this is very challenging so I have to rely on help from the airline staff to manage it. Otherwise nice product."
5,Funny Stuff from the Queen of the Trailer Park!,"Whether or not you actually execute any of Ruby Ann's kitschy krafts, this book will amuse you and put you in the campy Christmas spirit.Sparkling with humor and innate sense of down home fun, this holiday How-To manual will transform your white elephant trash into treasures to be cherished far beyond the next swap meet!A fun stocking stuffer for anyone who appreciates a good bouffant hairdo or the culinary value of potato chips in any casserole recipe."
4,Need a sense of humor,"I love this book. You have to have a good sense of humor, but also know that Ruby has some pretty clever ideas. I am almost afraid to try some of the ideas, but overall there are some funny and clever things in this book."
5,Ruby Ann,"Ruby Ann Boxcar is the funniest author! Her description is wonderful.I have read many of her books and all are laugh out loud funny! The recipes she includes are a scream, too."
1,OUTDATED CPR information,I have not seen this video; but it was released in 1996 and CPR skills were updated in 2000 and will soon be updating again. I would buy a more up to date tape. Much has changed since this tape was released.
5,Miracle : Bobby Allison and the Saga of the Alabama Gang,"Peter Golenbock has done it again .This book will open your mind and heart to the joy and tragedy that might come with being a racing family. It won't matter if you were fans of The Alabama Gang or not. You just need to be a fan of Racing to understand the drive that pushed Bobby Allison to continue to love the sport of racing which handed him and his wife Judy such unspeakable tragedy of the loss of two sons and almost cost him his life .This book will touch the heart of every NASCAR fan who has cheered his heart out for the win of a race.It will also touch the heart of every father and mother who has lost a child but continue to go on.This story is for anyone who is a fan of life and isn't that what we all are...A fan of life. A Must read for every fan of NASCAR , no matter who you want to win the race !"
1,Lots of errors,"While at it's core, this book does tell a compelling (and sometimes heartbreaking) story of the Allison clan, it is seriously handicapped by the author's failure to thoroughly research the subjects discussed in order to be accurate. Another shortcoming is the numerous mis-spellings, which should have been corrected during the editing process. An example is the author stating that Bobby Allison test drove the Buick Riata before it's release, when a simple Google search reveals the correct spelling is Reatta. In the end I found this book very frustrating and confusing to read. My advice is to pass it by."
3,BOBBY'S STORY,"Hmm...I'm not sure about this one. If you know Bobby Allison's story, you know that it's one of the most heart-wrenching, sad stories in all of sports. The beauty of Bobby Allison is that after all he has been through, he has soldiered on. He has overcome obstacles that would have killed most others, and he has done that with an inner strength that is truly amazing. Most people would be bitter and demoralized, yet Bobby remains positive, spiritually strong, and still a ""racer"". Racing took so much away from him, yet he still obviously loves the sport. His really is a great, inspirational story. The problem is, that doesn't come through very well in the book. The story of Bobby Allison and the Alabama Gang is a great one, and one that needs to be told... I'm just not sure this is where you want to read about it."
3,"Great story, but many errors","I enjoyed Miracle: Bobby Allison & the Saga of the Alabama Gang. The content was great-there was a lot of info in the book that I didn't know about the Allison family, which I appreciated. Why 3 stars? Well, I agree with W. DeWald-there were many errors in the book. I won't cite the errors, as W. DeWald's review was pretty comprehensive. I'm not a NASCAR authority, but I have followed the sport for over 20 years and know enough history to have been bothered by all of the errors."
4,A great book about the life of a NASCAR driver,"This book tells the story of the the Allison family & the Alabama gang, how they came to be and how far a driver will go to become one of the best drivers in Nascar. Just reading the story of Bobby Allison will make you realize that other peolpe in this world have it tougher than you and fight through the tough times with everything they have inside themselves."
5,American article by Kay Redfield have most of her books,"I have lived with Manic Depressive illness for over half of my life. Her books were true to life as if she were talking to me. I have worked with mental illness as patients I have been a priviate nurse worked with Alzimers patients for 8 yrs. Kay""s book have given me hope and strength to face what I have to each and every day. I was taking the drug Lithium as she did.For 30 yr then it became infective resulting in an episode requireing 11 days in a locked up hospital mental unit it has been 2 yr and I still suffer sleepless nights and turn to her books for help. Her books are great I can't say enough."
3,BJH,"This DVD is not too bad, its audio is in DTS and 5.1 but dont expect a audio mega blast, Its fairly ordinary the audio is presented in either format and very basic to listen to with an overall low level, Video is passible with a collection of videos transfered to DVD Needless to say for fans of BJH its good to have, a word of warning the navigation of this disc is extremley difficult to manage, the main problem being very poorly lit highlights you just dont know where you are on this DVD overall a score of 4 out of 10"
5,Unusual Courage,A wonderful story from a happy teenage girl to courageous woman in a few short years. Makes one wish they could display such love and courage.
5,Into My Hands went into my heart!,"I am an avid reader of all books about the Holocaust. I try to get my hands on every single good book out there about this topic. When this book came into my library, I was stoked! Irene is an incredible lady who survived rape, sexual advances from her female boss, becoming a mistress, and through all that and more managed to be a fabulous provider for the more than 12 Jews in her hands. To think of the life she lived, what she gave up, how precious life must have been, knowing that she could be caught at any moment. And Irene Gut Opdyke did all of this before she was 23. I rest my case. Read this and her other book ""Into the Fire"". You'll LOVE them and her by the first chapters!"
4,An unforgetable story,"I have to say that I came upon this book by accident. I am an avid reader of WWII. I was completely impressed by the life of Irene. I could not put this book down and when I was done it made me yearn for more. The reason for the 4 star review, is that I felt that the book rushed to an ending and could have elaborated more on her partisan days. I could have read another 300 pages. This story had to be told and should be used as a teaching tool in all highschools. I would love to have a sequel to this compelling book. To the author, please bring us more of this lady's fascinating life. These stories must never be forgotten."
3,A Moving Account of WWII,"Moving account of the ravages of war. WWII was an horrific time in history and I still marvel at the kindness that pervaded this period. Other books have told this same story and told it better, but In My Hands is still a compelling account of the Polish people's sacrifices to help stop the atrocities happening all around them."
5,"In Hard Times, There Is No One's Hands You'd Rather Be In Than Hers","Irene was a Polish girl who suffered first at the hands of the Russians, then the Germans, and then the Russians again during WWII. Despite all the horrors that befell her, she realized that war is made up of a series of choices made by people who have free will. She was determined that her choices would be ones that would promote life.While being forced to work for the Nazis, Irene witnessed a brutal murder of a baby who was thrown in the air and shot, in front of his mother, who was shot immediately afterwards. The vision of that atrocity haunted her and solidified her determination to do good.In 1982, Irena was honored in Yad Vashem in Israel, as one of the Righteous Among Nations for saving the lives of a dozen Jewish people, who would surely have perished were it not for her dramatic and selfless sacrifices.This book is her story. It is spectacular."
5,Awesome,"I just finished listening to this book on tape. It was extremely well done from Irene's recollection of events. The Holocaust was an atrocity to society, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't study the topic. Hitler and his regime need to be understood to prevent similar occurences in the future. I can't image what she was going through during those times and I wonder how many of us could even begin to imagine her anguish."
5,A must read,"Having read many Holocaust and WWII books written by both historians as well as survivors, for some reason this one sticks out in my mind. I think there must just be something about this brave woman (not to discount the untold stories of the countless other brave men and women of this time) that captured me from the beginning. It took almost no time to read because I needed to know what happened and was immersed in the story.After having read this, it was passed around my office to no less than 6 other people, all of whom had similar reactions. Definately a must-read."
5,A True Hero,"This book is the most powerful, incredible, and moving book I have ever read. It starts out a little shaky, and looks as though the author is quite simplistic, but as you get into it, you can't put it down! I could never wait to find out what happens next! Bravo to Mrs. Opdyke for an incredible story, and even more so, for an incredible life."
4,An inspiring story,"This story is unbelievable one. At first i kept thinking to myself ""what story this, what a brave girl"" and then i kept on telling myself this really happened. This is a story of a girl that sacrificed her own life to save others. Being Jewish this story meant even more to me and i believe that anyone that reads this will be touched by it."
4,i think this would be a great book,"well, i'm very grateful that i have met irene gut opdyke. i met her last week. she was a friend of my classmate's family. she told us her story orally. it really touched me and everyone else who was with me. it was really sweet that she gave her spare time to share her story to us even though she had gone to a surgery a day before we met her. i didn't realize how tragic her life was until i met her. she truly deserves to be a hero."
4,Bravo,"I enjoyed reading this true story of one of the righteous non-Jews who managed to save herself, her sister, and several Jewish people from the concentration camps. It was interesting to read about the other groups who were mistreated and whose civil rights were compromised by the Nazis. The story is well constructed, with just enough realistic detail to help the reader feel like a witness of the horrific injustices, without getting lost in darkness. I appreciate the author's overall sucessful attempt to help us understand each character. Even her Nazi officiers had a human side that made them both abhorant and tragic. A good read."
5,"Engrossing tale, beautifully, beautifully written","This story is told in a simple and straightforward fashion, beginning with a couple of chapters that are astonishingly lyrical, but it is no simple tale. Were it not for the photographs documenting the events, it would be virtually unbelievable. I could not put it down. I do not know if it won awards, but it of the highest quality in both the material conveyed and the lovely writing style, which all but disappears, allowing the events to unfold as if the reader is just there, witnessing them. Highest recommendation. My only teeny nitpick is that the section on pronunication comes at the end. I read it first, and found it very helpful in hearing the words and names as I read. But I warn the reader not to skip ahead to the section giving historical background, as I did, because it contains information better read at the end."
3,Good looking but not well-made.,"These lights look very nice, but one of the plastic stands easily snapped in trying to put it into soft dirt, and some of the lights don't work."
5,a son that didn't work construction,"john turturro captures with his directorial excellence all the things he could not be to his father. This homage to the elder turturro captures the day to day grind of a ""one man show"" construction company and the problems that arise when working with family members. The lost art of craftmanship is worshipped here with a vengance. The skill of turning a pile of lumber into a home, one nail at a time, with love and conviction.

2,"Meh, it is a wege",Don't bother buying this if you have a wedge already. Don't bother buying this if you have a wedge already.
5,quality,Strange to say I have purchased another brand and have had 2 of them break ..... what how could they break ? well they were cast and well I guess cheap cast. This one has not been used a year yet but if it makes the year and it will you can just tell it will. Then I am pleased Estwing has always made a great product and made to last. The wedge also gets into the wood and split better than the one we got at the depo and lowes ....
1,Disappointing tool,The idea is to use a wedge when the going gets tough and this particular tool has proven to be totally USELESS in such a situation. Case in point - I was working a white oak that was dying and had already partially dried up. My splitting ax was not going into the logs and I was not getting anywhere splitting the logs. Using the wood splitting wedge made NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever. Hammering it in got it stuck and the logs would not crack. I even had a hard time removing the stuck wedge from the logs. What finally did the trick was a twisted wedge from Germany - a wedge that has a 90 degrees twist. There was still a lot of hammering involved but it reliably cracked the logs.Final word: If your splitting ax cannot do the job this tool will not help you.
2,Nothing special...,"I bought this after reading very good reviews here on Amazon. To my disappointment, this thing isn't anything special. Doesn't perform any better than a $10 splitter you can buy at home depot. Definitely over priced at $19..."
1,Breakable,This rocket is -0 Star beacuase it said to bent gently and it broke and it said to a slight cut on the wings and it broke.Quest Product got on my Nerves
3,Works good but cheaper alternatives work even better,"I got this in a ""sensitive skin"" bundle from an art of shaving store and am not impressed with their products. Their after shave balm and pre-shave oils are good though. Their shaving cream is too thin for me and the ""moisturizer"" left my face feeling tingly and burnt for awhile after shaving. If you're looking for something to rub on your wet face after shaving buy proraso pre/post shave cream (not their sensitive one though) in a jar. Their stuff in the glass bottles isn't as good- one is a liquid and one is a lotion."
5,Great tennis bag.,"Great Bag, holds 3 of my racquets, shoes, balls, and tennis clothes with plenty of more room."
3,great movie,"Just did not realize it was coming from the US, so it won't work in my dvd/blueray-will in my laptop."
2,Poorly acted and obvious,Brad Pitt cutting off human scalps... Please. And who could've guessed that Aidan Quinn's lovely young intended would fall for the troubled Pitt... Gimme a break.Way overated
2,Ugh! No mas!,"Where are the good writers? What was this supposed to be? If you like a contrived plot, cardboard characters, stupid dialogue, you will love this movie. Alright, the scenary was wonderful, hence the two stars."
1,Legends of the Fall,"Legends of the Fall (Deluxe Edition)Inner clip broken.DVD all scratched,some parts untrackable.Collecter box all corners damaged.Better packageing would have taken care of this.As for the factory case,what a piece of junk."
3,Legends of the Fall,"A very dramatic and excellent movie, highly recommend it. A pity the BluRay transfer is soft and not crisp as should be; I give a 3 star for this reason only. It is a 5 star for the movie itself."
2,Ho Hum,"Unfortunately, the wait was not because they were doing a better job....This movie is a fairly recent movie, compared with, let's say, ""Out of Africa"", but the work done to make it Blu-ray was not well done. I have both movies and I would say that the original is a better representation of what the movie requires. The Blu-ray, in this case, did not add any clarity to the grandeur of the landscapes, nor enhance the softer character lighting. This movie is a classic and requires more than what was given it. I am greatly disappointed that the tech people did not figure that out before working on it...."
5,My wife loves it.,Actors played the characters rather than themselves like Tom Hanks and Jim Carrey do. Plot was good. Ending kept the main character in his unique role.
2,Pretty. Very pretty. Really dumb.,"A remarkably pompous and self-important film. Elements from William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway never manage to coalesce. We just get lots of truly gorgeous scenery, and a witless script that loads on the Mythic Significance with a shovel. Brad Pitt stands around rehearsing for a Calvin Klein shoot. Aidan Quinn lets his big baby blues tear over. Anthony Hopkins chews scenery. Only Julia Ormond comes out unscathed. A film of value only as a collection of images of the wilds of Canada. Not as a drama."
1,Ridiculous with a capital R,"Boy, this is one silly movie! Now answer truthfully, If your lover pulled a knife on you in bed, wouldn't that be the end of your relationship? Well, that's the kind of stuff going on in this incredibly unbelievable movie. This was my first Brad Pitt movie, and I just don't see what all the hoopla is about. And check out Anthony Hopkins--even after he strokes out, he's still pulling his rifle out on people!One legend that doesn't merit perpetuating."
1,Implausible and fragmented,"Unsatisfying, grotesque, lame parable about selling out. Pitt tries for smoldering, but comes off smarmy. Ormond is aloof and never connects with anyone, let alone her character. The little brother is pitiable and loathsome. Hopkins is the only bright spot - making the best of a flawed role.Save your money."
2,not,Not recommended. 10 minutes was more than enought for this movie. Thanks to fast forward. Boring. Couldn't get into it.Nice nature. Violence.
1,Horrible !,"It's a commercial for Brad Pitt on the horse, which is unnecessarily and annoyingly long. That's it, nothing more. Besides, it doesn't work. Brad Pitt looks stupid in this movie, thouth I admit he is still hansome. Nearly all of the characters are annoyingly irreasonable and irresponsible. Female characters look especially stupid. Also, I am really sick of seeing white people mystify the native Americans, pretending to forget the fact it's the White who destroyed them almost entirely.It's not a good movie, though its background is beautiful and some hansome and pretty people are in it."
1,the best part of the entire movie...,"...is when brad pitt gets eaten by the bear.here's the reader's digest version of the movie:close up on brad pitt's hair.julia ormond cries.someone dies.julia ormond cries.close up on brad pitt's hair.someone dies.julia ormond cries.anthony hopkins suffers a stroke.someone dies.close up on brad pitt.julia ormond cries yet AGAIN.more people die.more people cry.brad gets eaten by the bear (yahoo!)it's *not* an epic. it's not a masterpiece. it's silly, inane, and melodramatic--that's why only 13 year old girls love it and want to name their boys 'tristan.' please, little girls, don't name your boys 'tristan.' they'll hate you. they'll get beaten up at school."
5,It reminds me of a life that could have been,"This is a magnificent film but one that can only be appreciated by those who know the true beauty of Montana like scenery and those who are not scared to appreciate their emotions and what they bring out. Its an intriguing tale of a family who make their homestead in Montana and each of their travels through life centered on Tristan(Pitt) and the patriarch(Hopkins).It makes me long for the outdoor life and simple living that may still be there to be had. Any person who is not cold inside or who has disdain for the ills of society or regimented society itself will be drawn into this world and will not easily escape.If you identify with tristan's story then try the razors edge another film that I get reminded of when I think of tristan's story, a search for the real meaning of our existence."
5,Better than the Book!,"The book is great, the movie is better. It explores the psychology of men in such a way that rivals even ""The Godfather"" (though the film itself does not). Brad Pitt is a mighty actor, and he completely melts into his part as Tristan. Wow!"
4,"Lavish, star-studded soap opera","Great performances by an all star cast and gorgeous cinematography highlight this often overwrought historical sudster.Aidan Quinn gives a spot on performance as the eldest of three turn-of-the-century brothers, with equally strong turns by Brad Pitt and Henry Thomas. The burden of the picture rests on Pitt's often exposed muscular shoulders, but still it remains an ensemble piece.The Native American aspect to the story brings an added dynamic to this interesting tale. Beautiful costumes and lighting, too...although the constantly changing (and obvious) wigs, wiglets, hairpieces, spirit-glue facials hairs and falls get a bit tiresome.There are also some gratuitous buttocks shots of Brad for his many admirers. Julia Ormand, however, was not similarly objectified."
4,good epic drama,"a little silly and overwrought at times but if you like epic dramas, you'll be entertained"
4,Worth watching,I somehow missed viewing this movie when it was in theatres.I was attracted to it by some music from the soundtrack sodecided to buy it.The scenery and cinematography are wonderful even thoughthe story has many dark turns.
3,Brad Pitt is trailer trash,"The movie is entertaining to watch and silly, but it's overrated. Brad Pitt is trailer trash looking. Brad Pitt looks like he needs to take a shower badly."
2,Disappointing Blu,"This movie took a very long time to make it to Blu Ray. So when it did I couldn't wait to upgrade this film from dvd to blu. Imagine my surprise to find this elegantly written, and beautifully photographed film to be quite grainy, overly contrasty, and drab. At one point I actually put in my old dvd to compare. Although it was softer in comparison the blu isn't that much of an upgrade. Heavy sigh. I believe the marketing term that they used is newly 'remastered'. Extremely hard to believe.John Toll deserved the Oscar that he won and the film is worthy of a better 'remastering' than the one that is offered here. Its a huge disappointment to see this movie in Blu. It is one of the poorest discs remasted in the medium. Buyer beware."
4,Really good movie,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I like the story and the movie."
3,Not to be contrary,"The two previous reviews are a little gushing IMHO. This film is beautifully photographed. After that, there's little to rave about. The acting is poorly directed. The script seems forced and contrived in situations where some greatness is called for. It's also one of those movies that uses up well over two hours but seems like far too much was edited out leaving many story lines unfulfilled. This is like a 12 hour mini-series crammed into a few hours. And why is Brad Pitt illuminated like he's a christ or something? The guy is eye candy enough without making him glow on mountaintops. It's just too much. Great cast and photography. But the writing and the direction sabotage this effort. In the end it's becomes another weeper worthy of the Hallmark Channel."
3,"'s a jo', this dvd, man!","Although I like the film, I think this is not a Special Editions. 3 deleted scenes and 2 uninteresting featurettes, heaven, what do these people think that produce these so-called Special Editions? But as I said at the beginning, the movie is very good, although it might be sort of corny at some parts. I especially liked the ending, which is pretty bloody and pretty good filmed as well.The story generally is about three brothers who all fall in love with the same woman. One bro dies, the second goes crazy, the 3rd fails to make her happy and in the end there is a whole deal of revenge business Brad Pitt has to get rid of! Cool. I bought the soundtrack too - it's very good, I like to listen too it from time to time while reading. See for yourself!"
3,Different Movie,"Legends of The Fall was okay, but there was way to many deaths and time went by so quickly it was pretty confusing. In my opinion, Brad Pitt was good, but his character was a few cans short of a six pack if you know what I mean. Julia Ormond is a good actress (I saw her in First Knight with Sean Connery) but in both movies she can't seem to keep one man. Yeah it's R and not for young children anyway, but I still don't think I'd recommend it to many people. Itwas just weird. Call me slow, but I had trouble following the storyline. Legends of the Fall just didn't do much for me."
2,"A mawkish, overlong family drama","Well intended but unsatisfying melodrama with flat performances, a mediocre recreation of the time period, and a story that has as much wit and subtlety as a pro-wrestling match. You've seen it all before: complications of love between two brothers, a World War I subplot, and Hopkins overacting! This movie could have been made fifty years ago, and made much better, with stars like Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy as the father, Liz Taylor as the young woman, and Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift as the two sons. Well, at least that's who I see as the leads."
1,Legends of the Fall,I never received this DVD and was sent a different movie instead. I tried to request to be sent Legends of the Fall and was told there weren't anymore in stock!
1,I hated it,I hated the plot of this movie. I started watching it and almost immediately hated it. I wanted to see how it ended so I forwarded through to different chapters which only made me hate it more. I watched the end and screamed at the movie (which I never do) took the CD and broke it and threw the cover away. Yuck.
5,Battlestar Galactica,I loved the new series of Galactica. A long time I want to purchase this miniature. And now I got it!
2,too small,I guess I should have read the size better. It doesnt extend so you cant reach much. I am returning.
3,A quick .. too quick .. a read,"This book just blazes along. It's a quick .. too quick .. a read. While the task of covering 250 years (or so) of California in 344 (small) pages is an impossible task, the result is a text that is superficial and that would be appropriate for a summary tourist guide.I think Professor Starr knocked this one out in his sleep. His other works are much more valuable.I would pass right by this volume and proceed directly to ""California; An Interpretive History"" by Rawls/Bean (now in its 8th Edition). For good reason, Rawls/Bean is the standard introductory survey to California history."
1,Very big let down,"As a student of California history, I was looking forward to Starr's condensed account of the state's history. After all, he has written many books on various eras of California and there was every reason to rejoice over a shorter book to learn more. However, I was very disappointed in this error-prone, often dry and shallow account of our history. While it is a fast read and some of the facts were interesting (like how California got its name), Starr tends to write some of the more uninteresting history of his beloved and favored San Francisco and glosses over some of the more important history of Southern California, one of the largest metropolises on the planet. While I haven't read all of the books on California history, I would not recommend this one as the defining one for those who want to learn more about the Golden state."
4,well done and very readable,"I think the State Librarian has covered a lot of ground in a small space and done so with a fascinating writing style. I am somewhat surprised, however, that as a scholar, there would be such a glaring error in the 1978 Chronology. George Moscone and Harvey Milk were not murdered in December of that year, but on the 27th of November. A seemingly small thing but not to San Franciscans. I'm sure Mr. Starr's latest book will rank with all the other ones for their ability to bring the reader into a time and place that is not done by many writers.I'm sure the book will meet with much success as it seems to have so far."
1,factual errors,"On page xxiv, Chronology, Kevin Starr states that ""1945 Bank of America employs ENIAC computer"". I wonder what the author means by ""employs"" as ENIAC computer was run at the Moore School at the University of Pennsylvania from 1945 until January 1947 and then moved to Aberdeen Proving Ground, where it operated from July 1947 until October 1955. No relation to the Bank of America. I wonder what other factual errors this book contains and how much I can trust the author with his story."
5,California Dreaming...,"Another triumph for the Modern Library Chronicles! If you want to understand why people around the world continue their California dreaming--read this book. It is a very easy read but full of interesting facts encompassing the periods of 1510-2005. Yeah, that comprehensive. I will keep it as a reference book, one that I am sure I will come back to for the rest of my life. Viva California!"
5,"One of the best, if not the BEST western ever.","This Peckinpah classic is a must see for anyone that can appreciate what a ""perfect film"" is all about.It never crowds you, it never bores you, the scenery is remarkable, and Randy Scott and Joel Macrea givethe best performances of their long and illustrious careers. I can't wait to see it again as it's a two timeper year must see. This movie unlike any other western I've ever seen, and I've seen em all, actuallymoves me emotionally at the end, I almost cried! Imagine that!! It is high art at it's best, and is a movie to be treasured for it's timeless simplicity, moral lessons, and how an old guy can still get it done!!!"
3,wild west,"Can't beat the price and the quality, as a John Wayne nut of recent I especially enjoyed Chisum. All of TCM's movie have been great"
2,Good Movie - mediocre video,"A good movie, however, the video version needs to be letterboxed. The wide screen photography that is mentioned in Leonard Maltin's review is not to be seen with the video."
3,Not As Good as Remembered,This is a great movie whenever Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott are alone on the screen. The rest of the cast is very weak. The decors smack of the 60's as do the costumes and make-up. The dance hall girls do not look turn of the century and the Chinese restaurant is made of materials that did not exist in 1900. So I enjoyed seeing two great stars act together but was disappointed bt the rest.
2,"I don't get the ""picture""","As a new teacher, I am constantly searching out new and interesting ways to present material to my classes. Since grammar is particularly boring to students, I bought this book in hopes of finding some new, exciting way to teach it. Instead, I got a book with lots of theory but no real ""practice"", and a cd-rom that has pictures I could have obtained from the web myself. Noden has a wonderful idea, but he seems to have left out the most important chapter in his book: HOW TO USE IT! In addition, there is little said about the part of grammar we all have trouble teaching--the rules. Most of this book relies on content and revision of WRITING, instead.I like that idea, but with the burden of standardized testing, students need to know the rules behind the revisions, too. If you have time to come up with your own ways of using Noden's great concepts, get the book. If you don't, wait for him to come up with a practice manual."
3,It was OK,"The photographer is good, but not great in my opinion and other than being beautiful, the models aren't great either. Just another marketing thing to get people to pay for a brochure I guess. I had hoped it would be more interesting with Photoflex's brand name attached to it like that on the cover. About the only thing that helps it is that it has a few good behind the scenes segments on how to use some light modifiers for photographers who don't know what they are doing."
3,Insane Asylym,"interesting, yet horrifying accounts from an actual inmate at a state mental hospital. I was a bit confused at first, but I figured out it was one person telling about all the different characters around him. Sometimes hard to follow."
4,Great Item DONT BUY IT FROM AMAZON,"Amazon offers rebates for new service activation, good luck receiving them! I bought my phone over 6 months ago and I haven't received any rebate whatsoever! Don't get trapped in the deceiving advertisement!"
4,"Does the job, mostly...","Pros: Great for holding my pots and pansCons: The top shelf really isn't deep enough to hold the lids entirely. They hang off the edge. This isn't a safety issue, just an aesthetic issue."
4,"Very nice, no stud mounting needed (with toggle bolts)","I live in a small rental house and wanted more space in my cabinets. Though the reviews state you NEED to mount this to studs, you actually do not. To mount this to dry wall you will need toggle bolts (got mine from lowes). These bolts will hold 235 pounds each. I am using a total of 2 On the top holes where the arms are and 2 regular screws on the bottom. I have wll my pans anf pots hanging and have zero issues so far (1 week). The only complaint i have is that the coating is cheap and will scratch very easy, also the grate that covers the shelf is not even. But for $71 i am very satisfied."
4,the very best,I recieved these pans yesterday and tried them out right away. They are the best I have ever used. You will not waste your momey when you buy these.
3,ok for starter set,"I know that this set was inexpensive but, as I learned again, you get what you pay for. The handles look and feel like they won't take too much weight-looks like they are welded on-no screws-the stainless steel is thin. I was hoping for more-would work for someone just starting out-not for a avid cook."
2,low quality,"This is a low quality cookware, and I'm very unhappy about it.The lid can get hot where you might need a kitchen glove.The cover lid I can't get a good grip on it.The button is copper which should be sliver color stainless steel. Base on experience cooper button do come out round 6 months of use."
5,arghhhh...,"2 months late? no tools? almost $20 more? Sure does make the Mac version less attractive.Anyways, aside from that its a great game, and the multiplayer is far beyond addictive. There are new weapons, new multiplayer maps, and the awesome single player game still intact."
2,HALO MAC HOPELESS WITHOUT GAME PAD SUPPORT,"Now as a great Halo fan, I was looking for to this for months. The graphics are perfect and fabulous but as virtually everyone buying this is used to playing it on Xbox, MACSOFT never told anyone that they couldn't be bothered to add GAMEPAD support! Of course the pc version has. It would have taken them an extra day to do it but didn't. SO until they do this is a MOST USELESS game to play as using a mouse and keyboard require 17 hands and two sets of eyes just to get some basic gameplay, SO until they deal with this SERIOUS issue do NOT BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY as they may NEVER release the patch to allow GAMEPAD support. best Barrie Roness"
1,Major problem,"Lets see on a top of the line mac this game is very choppy. I can't run at full screen mode 1600x1200 with hi res graphics. Very, slow. Under 5 frames per second. So I bumped it down to 800x600 medium graphic and got choppy but ok game play. Like playing a new game on a 5 year old system. In a word bad.UT 2004 looks great, plays great at 32bit color, 1600x1200 with full graphics. This game won't even play well at the low end of the settings. (...)Oh, the full system was Dual 2 Ghz G5, 1.5 GB RAM, ATI Radion 9800 128 MEGS ram."
5,HALO Combat Evolved Mac OS,"Over the past month this has been a truly addictive game. Just the campaigns have had me cringing and jumping out of my seat. The graphics are nifty, even on my somewhat modest dual 867 Powermac G4 with a paltry 32 MB of VRAM. If the campaigns are cool, the multiplayer action is downright marvelous! I connect via gameranger and play for hours against whoever is out there in myriad settings and game types. I am considering upgrading my machine in the hopes that there are more HALO titles coming! Kudos to whoever is responsible for porting this so that we few trivial Mac gamers can enjoy a taste of what the rest of the world is playing...albeit a few years later:-("
1,INTEL MAC OWNERS BEWARE!!!,"I just purchased this game after getting my new 24"" Intel iMac (dual 2.16ghz, 2gb RAM w/ 256mb GeForce GT 7600 upgrade) and I am very disapointed with the Intel port (2.0). On my monster machine it runs at 15-20 FPS on nominal graphic settings, even at 800x600 with all textures on normal. I don't know what MacSoft did with the 2.0 universal update but it runs like an absolute dog on my high end iMac.To put this into perspective: DOOM 3 maxes out at 60FPS (and 60FPS is the built-in limit for DOOM 3) for 95% of the game on the same machine. Oh, and that is running at 1920x1200 on the highest possible detail, so it's not 'lacking the grunt' so to speak.My friend has a Powerbook G4 1.5mhz with a 32mb video card and Halo 1.5 (PPC) runs faster than it does on my new high end iMac... So if you're planning on buying this to play on an Intel Mac DO NOT DO IT, YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3,"Decent, but Xbox is definately the best platform for halo","Alrighty, I see some of you folks playing this have really souped up macs. Well I'm on a Powerbook G4 (laptop) for school, 867 MHz, 256 MB Ram and in order to run the game period, I have to set all the display settings to their lowest or turn them off. The game looks like crap, yes, but I enjoy it so much I could care less how it looks. If you are knocking the game because you don't have a good enough graphics card, get a life. Yes, it lags (especially for me) but what do you expect? It's a good game, and it's best on XBOX so if you have the choice, play it like that. Otherwise, quit complaining."
4,Great gameplay. Questionable plot turn.,"My (9yr old) son and I both enjoy this game very much, and come back to play the more enjoyable levels from time to time.The decision to include CREEPY(!), zombie-like aliens put my son off the game; ""Papa, could you get past this level for me?"". I know, it's a ""mature"" game; but he enjoys many other ""mature"" games, all the way through.Anyhoo, beautiful graphics, great sense of immediacy (we both lean and duck in our chairs, trying to avoid getting hit), and high replay value."
1,Not Worth the Library's Shelf Space,"Isn't it fishy that this book was reviewed by 3 people, each within 2 days of the other, posting nearly the same glowing ""review"" (5 stars of course) and not one of these 3 reviewers have voiced an opinion on any other book, at any other time before or after this book? How cheezy.Like the one ""real"" reviewer, I also thought this book was textbookish and read more like a term paper for a community college class, only with about 80,000 too many words."
5,Childhood Favorite,"I saw Willy Claflin perform live several times when I was a child and got all his (then) cassettes for Christmas presents over the years. I loved Maynard and Rocky and all their songs and stories. To this day, many years later, I still chuckle when I think of Maynard's ridiculously mixed up fairy tales. Cinderella and the Three Bears is delightful and speaks to the silliness in all of us."
5,"great television, good price","I just bought the jvc 27"" and so far I'm pretty happy with the picture and the way the remote works. I have it hooked up to my toshiba dvd player and they work well together. The 3 line digital comb works great and the component imputs were compatable with each other. You have to hit a couple of buttons to get everything turned on but once on its set. I don't know how the speakers are because I have a surround sound system hooked up, sorry. I gave 5 stars and have no real complaints."
4,Good resource!,"""They Signed the Constitution"" by Elizabeth Levy has become an excellent resource for me to use in the classroom. I teach 7th grade social studies, and we spend 1 quarter of the year on government. My colleague and I have used most of this book for the past 3 years to supplement the rest of the material we use. We have also created a worksheet to be used with it. Students take turns reading aloud in class from this book. They find it easy to read and easy to understand, definitely not the dry textbook we're used to reading! I recommend this book for elementary and junior high teachers teaching government, as well as students looking for an easy way to understand part of our early American history."
5,This book is fantastic!,"This book is well-written and extremely informative. It's a good book for anyone (of any age) who wants to understand the Constitution better, and how the Constitution came into being. I bought it because I am using it as an elementary school teacher, but it really is a great topic for all of us to better understand."
5,Held 3rd graders attention,Great book with lots of facts. Very entertaining and was able to keep the attention of a third grade class. A+
5,book,Hoping to go in August and will give this to the kids. Hoping they will look thru it before we go so we can figure out what we want to look at.
4,French book,I was fulfilling a Salvation Army wish listThis was the best I could find for a 6 year old who wanted a book onFrance.
2,Gardner's Tone is Nauseating,"As an MFA student, I thought this classic would be useful, but I found it extremely difficult to focus on what Gardner was trying to say because his message is relayed in such a pompous tone that it was nearly impossible for me to see past it. I understand that he's good at what he does, and bravo to him-- but please, it's hard to take someone seriously when they tout their opinions as facts. I'd recommend reading this because every person is different and what someone else might find this book brilliant, but personally I was so turned off by his cockiness that I had to stop reading."
5,Every writer should read this book.,"I have read this book four times and given it to about ten writers I know. Its like a bible and each time I read it I find something new. I never could have written my novel, Lip Service if I hadn't studied Gardener. Especially importand are his comments on rewriting."
2,The Art of Fiction,Chockful of information but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe because I am not a young writer. I don't know.
2,2 Stars.,"This book has many wonderful reviews. I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. So I read it, then read it again. I didnt find much that is helpful to new writers. Certainly no ""Ah,Hah!"" moments.Gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me: ""If you were lost in the Amazon jungle would you want an Indian to help you OR someone who knows a lot about Indians?"" Gardner knows a lot about writers! This book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature. Very interesting book.But what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery. New writers are not Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac. New writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly...later they can soar."
3,Good & Bad,"First for the bad. The entire first half of the book was filled with opinion stated as fact in his over-confident manner that is painful to read through. There was very little of value in that first half - in fact, I'd recommend skipping it if you do purchase the book.Second - the good. The second half was extremely valuable and informative. It gave me several aspects of writing I hadn't given much consideration to a new light. I do recommend the book for this alone. His condescending let up almost entirely and Gardner actually shared the knowledge he had on the subject."
3,An excellent guide if you already know a whole lot,"Although there is much to be learned from Gardner's classic, when I've used this text in my college intro to fiction-writing courses, it doesn't fly too well. My students are put off by Gardner's insistence that the young writer is always male, and they usually haven't read many of the works to which he refers. Because Gardner is so exacting about what good fiction is, many students feel paralyzed after reading *The Art of Fiction*--they feel it's impossible to do anything even remotely correctly. But if you can get past those problem areas, then this book is a gold mine. The exercises are provocative and, yes, educational."
3,Not so good,"There is some very good information in this book but, in general, I did not like it. I found it sometimes too abstract, sometimes simplistic. Moreover, I think that the author is right when he says that writing very long sentences may be a good exercise, but I just wish he had not done it so often in his text.I much prefer David Lodge's ""The Art of Fiction"""
2,Vastly Overrated,"Tendentious and outdated in the sense that Gardner's views on the mechanics of fiction come right out of English departments of the 1940's and 50's. And I know it's been said elsewhere, but his defaulting to the masculine personal pronoun is incredibly grating. And then there's the question of why we are supposed to care about the views of someone who was neither prolific nor especially successful himself as a writer of fiction? He makes a few interesting points, but overall it's a pretty tedious read."
2,beware ...,"If you aren't well-versed in the Canon of Great Literature, then most all of the author's references -- and perhaps a good deal of what he has to say -- will be lost on you. There are a number of good, clearly stated ideas in this book, but after wading through three quarters of it, I have to say that there must be a better way. To wit, probably better than half of them can be had by reading the previous reviews and any one of a number of internet pages that address the common mistakes of beginning writers. If my knowledge of literature was as complete as Gardner assumes his readers' to be, I wouldn't need to read a book about writing ... Perhaps that's a good bit of Gardner's point, but I paid money for a book about how to write, not for a reading list. I'll be moving on to Burroway's ""Writing Fiction"" before I subject myself to the remainder of this snobbish morass. Esthetes only; mortals beware."
2,high brow advice,"Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for."
1,Spare your pennies,This book by John Garndner seems to go on and on with making himself important and well-read. I found it hard to focus.
2,"Difficult, Demanding Text on Writing","If you're a beginning fiction writer, odds are that this book will be too difficult for you. Don't be misled by the glowing reviews. Sure, Gardner knows more about writing than most of us ever will. But his philosophical discussions and frequent allusions to classic literature make this book suitable only for the best of students. Browse it in the library before you plunk down your money."
3,good points included,"This book is more gentle than I imagined something from the famously egomanical John Gardner would be. And it does have some good advice. But I DO think that one should consider that 1) Gardner notoriously said, ""I am the greatest writer since Chaucer."" 2) Almost all of Gardner's many novels and short-story collections are already out of print. Hardly Chaucer-like!"
4,"Unique, helpful writing reference book","As a writing instructor and literary agent, I am a regular visitor to writing reference sections. John Gardner's book is sometimes hard to read and follow, but it does explain the basics. And I haven't found any other writing reference book that discusses psychic distance (a very important beginner concept, *not* ESP!) and word rhythms (an advanced concept) quite as well as this one does. This should probably be the third or fourth book a writer should buy, after Stein on Writing, Getting the Words Right, and perhaps Valerie Storey's The Essential Guide for New Writers."
4,An excellent guide,"This is an excellent book that covers a wide range of issues in fictional writing, in fact, I would venture that it covers most everything that an aspiring writer needs to consider. Gardner's fundamental principle is to view all fiction as a 'fictional dream', and this leads to a lot of very useful advice and criticism. He goes on to discuss various more philosophical as well as practical, technical issues in a superbly informative and entertaining manner, with lots of excellent examples from very good literature. But beware that Gardner expects his student (reader) to think for himself! Above all Gardner tries to teach the reader to think like a writer, and I believe that he succeeds."
3,The Good Stuff is Buried in Wordy Prose,"I'm a journalist and writing teacher and do not think this book is very well-written or reader-friendly. It's dense, wordy, sometimes pompous and intimidating, too. At times, Gardner seems to be putting down young writers. I made myself read his book since I've been hearing that it's a classic for years. Finally, after three attempts, I got to some good stuff in it--i.e. don't put yourself between the reader and the story or say things like, 'Mary saw...'--just tell us what she saw and make it more direct. But there is far too much to wade through! I much prefer books like BIRD BY BIRD or IF YOU WANT TO WRITE for inspiration (they don't put you down)and SELF-EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS for craft (a gem of a book, beautifully written). If this book were not written by a noted novelist, I doubt that it would have been published without substantial editing. I think it's more disheartening than encouraging of young writers and writers in general."
1,they do not honor warrentys,we had a one year warrenty and at six months the moniter stopped working without any apparent cause. Our computer tech. and sales guy we bought from could not fix or get ahold of the company. The following six months went by with no word from the company by our tech. and us.I wouldnt waste money on ANY product by this company again. We paid well over 300 dollars for a flat moniter to work all of six months.AOpen SUCKSI wouldnt rate it even the one except for having no choice since there is no zero availableDo NOT waste your money on this companys products
2,Enchanged April DVD,I have to agree with previous reveiwers very disappointing. It is just not up to the quality and content of the Video.
5,A spirit-restoring gem,"This movie is perfectly realized; the writing, the photography, the cast and direction, the locale, all conspire together to create joy in the viewer. It is as if Joan Plowright, Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson and Polly Walker each was born to play her part in Enchanted April. The fact that the movie was actually shot in the real villa that had inspired the novel 6 decades before makes it all the better! I watch it again every year or so to refresh my spirit. In fact, I've all but worn my videotape out, and sincerely hope that this gem of a film will be released on DVD soon."
1,Not formatted for use in the US.,"This is my favorite movie so I wanted to buy one for my mother. (I bought the video many years ago and have watched it repeatedly.) However, I could not find a DVD that was formatted for use in a US player. I was disappointed."
3,Sweet Movie,"I enjoyed the movie, but I expected a bit more substance to get from Point A to Point B and the conclusion. The actors are all very good and the scenery is quite nice, but like I said it felt like they must have left out some scenes to get to the conclusion. I have not yet read the book or play the movie is based on, so I am not comparing it to another version. My initial reaction was, ""wow"" that must be some enchanted place for this turn of events."
3,Sad But Sweet,"This movie has an excellent cast, beautiful scenery, and wonderful acting. It is a rather melancholy depiction of restless women, bored with their husbands and lifestyle, tired of being overlooked and taken for granted by their husbands, but the end results are very encouraging, that married women can find romance with their husbands, just by getting away from it all. Funny how the men change once they are out of their controlling environment!! The men see their wives in a new light and suddenly what attracted the women to their husbands, is revived. If you are down in the dumps over your hum-drum marriage, this will give you a pick-me-up."
4,Enchanted April,I personally enjoyed the movie and bought two for gifts to friends who I know enjoy the same types of movies I do. Both recipients said they loved the movie.
4,Sweet and dreamy,"This is a great pick for people who need a pick-me-up or want to imagine a dreamy, sunlit paradise. No car chases, no torrid sex scenes. It's got romance, humor, and quiet introspection. I want to warn you that not a lot happens in the film. My favorite image is Miranda Richardson lying on the grassy hillside in Italy, dozing and trying to decide if she should invite her husband to the villa she and her friends have escaped to during London's rainy dreary spring. This movie is appropriate for grandmas and infants."
3,The film's a 5. This DVD is a 1.,"I was very pleased to see this film was to be released on DVD. 'Enchanted April' is a lovely and uplifting film, beautifully shot. Unfortunately this DVD edition is a cheap Mother's Day knockoff. It appears to have been mastered from the VHS edition with absolutely no adjustments or enhancements of any kind. It's hard to imagine the VHS edition being worse. The menu screen, which is barely necessary, is actually ugly - a considerable feat when this film is bursting with beautiful imagery. The picture is grainy, fuzzy and full screen with poor contrast and saturation.If you love this film don't sully it's memory with this travesty.Why is it when ""Braineating Zombies from the Planet of Rancid Puss"" can get the royal DVD treatment, cinema gems like 'Enchanted April' get treated so shoddily? Sadly we all know the answer to that question..."
5,Enchanted April DVD,Amazon made it easy to locate and order ... came within just a few days and was exactly what I wanted. Couldn't be happier!
4,20 years of love,I first saw this film when it first was in theatres. Its a quiet lovely film. Not over the top. I loaned it to a friend who them loaned it to another who kept it. Very happy to have it back in my collection:-)
4,Enchanted April - Enchanted story,"Like a lot of British productions, this movie was slow in the beginning - and somewhat depressing -- but we hung in with it and it turned out to be a very pleasant , and yes, enchanting movie."
5,"No Violence, Chase Scenes, Drugs or Sex. Just A Relaxed Movie About A Group of Strangers Renting an Italian Villa For A Month","The movie has some enjoyable elements to it as long as you are in the mood for a slow-moving story. The beginning shows the drab, unacceptable lives of several women, hopeless until one of them decides to change things. One by one, the others are added.The negatives would be the quality of the video and the fact that we don't see enough of the beauties of this Italian retreat.The positives include surprises in the personalities of the characters.I would advise watching this when you are in the mood for a pleasant story about people. There are no villains in the end. There are no explosions or chase scenes.The last scene was a joy to watch. It made me smile."
4,"Interesting and Scenic, But ...","This movie kept my interest and was very scenic, but I am at a bit of a loss to explain the point of it. When it got to the end, it had put me in a better mood and as were all the characters. I guess that must have been it then. In any case, I liked it and recommend it."
2,enchanted april,I received the movie...it started out fine but half way through it I had to turn the volume to 100% and still could not hear it. Any suggestions? Otherwise it was ok.
5,WE WANT THE DVD NOW!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a true sleeper... Joan Plowright is again an utter joy to watch. A must see for all, I really loved it.Please, when will the powers that be release this to DVD??? What are they waiting for???An absolute fantastic movie!! MUST SEE!!"
5,"Tra-la-la, tra-la-la","Oh, where to begin? This is one for the ages. It starts in cold and rainy London with two women who, in desperation with their unhappy marriages, rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. To afford it, they advertise and interview prospective candidates who will share the rent. Precious few respond, but off they go to an enchanted paradise where the mellow garden, sunshine, house, climate, food, ambiance cast their spells.Then the men somehow appear, and you think, Oh Damn, now the spell is broken... But nooooo. It just gets better - and better - and better.Joan Plowright's immortal line upon reclaiming her 1st choice room from a would-be squatter has passed into lore: 'I shall just sit here and think of better times and better men.'Don't miss this one. And then see it again. And again."
1,"After all this wait, a terrible transfer!","Of course this is one of the best films ever made. But for those of us who saw it in the theatre, bought the VHS, then bought the Laserdisc, this is a terrible disappointment. The sound quality is poor and uneven. The film looks like it was run at a grindhouse for a year before they made the transfer. Spots, runs, fades, off-colors, grain--in short, WHY? Why not take a film everyone's been waiting to appear for years & get the negative out of the vault? Do a little resotration? Shame on Miramax & Disney--they certainly won't be in my ""tub of love"" anytime soon."
5,movie,"What a soft movie in that it is touching and life changing in a soft, slow way and how love changes all or most all."
4,Good movie,Different........wish I could do it ....but no way would I invite the men......Interesting how everyone started out as strangers and became good friends.......
2,enchanting april,"boring, keep watching thought it would get better but it didn't. Gave the movie away it was not something I would want to watch again."
3,"Sweet, charming film","Enchanted April is a lovely film about two women who are both starved for attention from husbands who barely acknowledge them, and their time away in a beautiful Italian villa. The cast is terrific, including Alfred Molina and Joan Plowright. Beautifully photographed and well acted."
5,One of the Best!,Enchanted April is a number one in my collection of films (over 1000). It is a story of possibility and renewal. Even the men are transformed! It is a beautiful film with a great cast. You will want it in your collection.
2,WTF!,"First of all, I don't know if me and the other reviewers watched the same movie?!It made me very uncomfortable when Lotte kept kissing the old lady."
2,"A woman may like this movie, but it did not meet my interests.","They story was boring to watch, it was more what ladies may like to view. I need to check out movies before ordering a copy for home use."
1,Defective movies,"I tried purchasing this item twice. Both times, the dvd was stuck on ""director commentary"" and the movie would not play.I returned them and will not try to buy this movie from Amazon again."
3,Disappointed with Enchanted April,"I had high expectations for Enchanted April. With Alfred Molina and Joan Plowright heading a good cast, and having heard and read strong reviews for the film, I thought it would be a film I would enjoy. In short, it's alright, but it moves too slowly - and I like quiet, slowly unfolding films - but this one is simply too slow and uninteresting for my taste. Part of the problem is that the film seems very dated. The quality of the film itself is not very good, and everything about it seems lackluster. I didn't find the characters to be very interesting or compelling, and I wasn't moved by the film."
1,Suspect something wrong with Amazon DVDs,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon. When it arrived and I tried to play it, the scenes were all out of order. Amazon was good about quickly replacing it, but the second one does the same thing. All my other DVDs play just fine on my DVD player, which is connected to my Samsung TV. I will probably not be buying any more DVDs from Amazon."
2,Enchanted April,"This film is one of the finest and fairest stories ever told. Taken as a whole, the actors, the concept, the scenery, and the magic work perfectly (thank the director Mike Newell for that). I purchased a VHS copy over 10 years ago, and now I'm anxiously -- and a bit impatiently -- waiting for the DVD version which, no doubt, would be even more beautiful in every sense of the film. Step on it fellas - we're all waiting!!"
4,"Okay, but I was not enchanted",It was a fun movie to watch but I never found myself recommending this movie to anyone except to watch a rare and amusing flaw: in one of the dinner scenes while still in England there are some flowers in the middle of the dining table that are fresh when the woman is speaking with her husband and then when it switches during the same conversation between the faces of husband and wife you can notice that the flowers wilt -- then come back up again. LOL. Very funny.
2,Not Convincing,"Pretty picturesque views, but besides that not much else. The acting was stiff and not very well done. Especially Lotty -- that was some bad acting. We didn't get deep enough into the characters to really appreciate their epiphanies. Read the book and forget about the movie."
5,At last!,"I've been waiting for years - literally -for this movie to come out on DVD! It's lack of availability has left a tremendous hole in my collection. This is a gem of a film that deserves a wider audience and now it will get it. One of the finest ensembles of actors imaginable in a setting that will make you long to visit Italy. It will reaffirm your faith in the ability of the human heart to return to life regardless of how long it's been lying dormant. Once you've seen ""Enchanted Aprl"", it will become one of those comfort films to which you'll return again and again."
2,Disappointed in quality of DVD.,"I really like this story, but am disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The sound was bad and the entire movie was very dark. In some parts, the scenes were so dark, it was difficult to see the action. And in some scenes, the lighting faded almost to black and then it came back. All in all, the quality is very poor, especially at the beginning of the movie. Are all of the DVD's of this movie like this? I gave it two stars because of the poor quality."
5,Enchanted April,"A true delight! A beautiful exploration of what our hearts yearn for beneath the obvious, and the magic of unexpected relationships that can form when being true to oneself. Enjoy."
5,"Enchanting! Beauty, kindness ....","Enchanting! Beauty, kindness and togetherness and a sense of happiness. Women put together by circumstance of wanting more out of life. Brilliant cast of characters."
5,ABSOLUTELY GREAT MOVIE BEST OF THE BEST DVD RELEASED IN EUROPE,AS TO BE EXPECTED THERE IS NO US RELEASE ON DVD I HAVE THE VIDEO AND THE IMPORT DVD.PLEASE RELEASE THIS TITLE NOT KILLER MICE ON MARS OR KILLER TOMATO TRILOGY
4,Needs more appreciation!!!,"In my opinion, this movie is vastly underrated! One problem is that people want to compare it to Who Framed Roger Rabbit since they both make use of live action and animation. This movie, however, is not aimed toward children. In fact, the language, violence and adult situations make it unsuitable for children.What it DOES offer the grownup crowd, however, is amazing animation sequences along with top of the line actor ""live"" sequences. (We're talking Brad Pitt, Kim Basinger and Gabriel Byrne here.) This movie begs to be watched over and over again as the animation sequences are so intricate you see new things happening on screen everytime you watch. The animation/live action crossovers are also compelling.My suggestion, when first watching this movie, is to go into it expecting something different. In my opinion, it's well worth the time."
5,"Great Movie, Great Condition","I needed this item for a 'movie night' and just by the look of it, I knew there would be no problems. I watched it to be sure and was relieved to find that the movie played perfectly--in all its animated and live-action splendor. Thanks!"
4,DON'T MISS IT!,"I liked it! Holli IS the cutest thing. It opens another world..one where you need to watch your step. Yeah, some of the questions could be answered. What picked Pitt to be pulled into Cool World? What became of Holli? Do Lonette and Pitt have 2-d kids now? The music PLAY WITH ME and Cool world by Bowie are just great! And the rabbit was too funny..BUT I WON! See it!"
4,for teens only,"I was never aloud to watch this movie when I was younger, and for good reason. This movie would only be good for people who know curse words and know about sex. It is no childs movie. All in all it was a very good movie to watch. The plot is funny, and the characters are very amusing. If you watch it you should like it."
5,FABULOUS! A MUST-SEE FOR CARTOON FANS!,"This is a wonderful movie and a definate must-see for cartoon fans. Cute, but in a much more adult way than Roger Rabbit, Cool World is an odd but appealing and fun look into the separate worlds of humans and cartoons."
2,I've seen worse!!!,"I've seen worse!!! I think that this movie is trying to somewhat copy the fantastic movie ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"""
3,MINTY FRESH.........,"ITS THE CLOSE-UPS that get you - not too flattering for 1992 - lots of unfiltered frown-lines, etc. BUT overall quite a neat little plot ~ talk about being abducted!BRAD PITT ends up on - so to speak - the other side of the mirror in a sinister but very real 'toon world [akin to 'Roger Rabbit' but darker ... and these guys are not quite three-dimensional for good reasons].KIM BASINGER is the 'toon who wants out - wants the real world, and Gabriel Byrne is the 'toonist - caught in between the chaos.QUITE good stuff - but rather on the dark side - would like more of these ventures .... just a pity about Kim's odd little costume in the real world - the skirt didn't quite translate correctly [or was there an underskirt???] - oddly jarring."
1,Ghastly,"Brad Pitt tried when he was younger to do cutting edge work in film. As he rose the ladder he succumbed to the Hollywood cookie cutter style of acting, but you have to give him points for trying early on (remember 12 Monkeys and Fight Club or if you're really good - Johnny Suede). However this mishmash of an attempt to cash in on the success of Roger Rabbit was ill-conceived and badly executed. Not that Pitt didn't bring somehthing to his role and the same can be said for Kim Bassinger's badgirl, which made Jessica Rabbit look like Snow White, but they both failed to salvage the movie. The interaction with the doodles (toons in Rabbit) is mostly annoying and lacking in wit and style.The movie is noisy and meandering. Save your money.Save your money."
1,Bakshi's worst movie,"The movie is poorly written not to mention the lame special effects. Its a completly souless film. If you liked Fritz the Cat,Wizards,American Pop, or other films by Ralph Bakshi, than stay away from this, because its embarassing."
1,Holli Won't...,"More misogyny from the stunted, adolescent mind of Ralph Bakshi. People love to point out Bakshi's movies as ""adult,"" but I submit they're more in line with the musings of a junior high misfit. But mainly, they're about how much Bakshi hates, fears and misunderstands women.In this blatant ""Roger Rabbit"" retread mix of live action and crude animation, Gabriel Byrne plays a dimwitted cartoonist whose creation, Holli Would, comes to life in the luscious form of Kim Basinger, who proceeds to ruin his life and transform him into a gibbering, idiotic superhero cartoon. That is, when she's not killing other `toons and turning into a monstrous, hideous caricature of herself. Holli's just another in a long line of Bakshi women- either they must be pliant and vapid (the faeries of ""Wizards""), or manipulative shrews like Holli. Yep, women are truly evil, Ralph.Brad Pitt sports some crazy hair, but truly there's little here of adult interest. Adult meaning ""mature and reasonable."""
4,It's a great movie everyone should see it!!!,"It's no different from anyother movie,like spacejam it's just the same only this one is better!"
3,Could be a bit better,I think that this movie could have been done a bit better. It had a good concept and some well done scenes but it drags on a bit too much. The weird fantasy enviroment is awesome and it makes this film worth a peek if you like weirdness. The plot however can be viewed as a series of loosly conected holes together by stunning animation.
4,COOL WORLD,"Hey!, give a movie a break!!!! i myself love this movie.it shows 2 sides of life,and the 2 sides of society. people for real are like this in life,always wanting power,and creating problems,using drugs,alcohol,sex......trying to change themselves physically.....doing the forbidden,so,i dont see why people think the movie was so bad....hey,it could be your next door neighbor!!!!!or a great fantasy."
3,Fun to Watch,"This is not the best movie ever made, but if you have nothing to do, should definately watch.It has great animation, and for those Brad pitt fans, he comes out extremely hot."
3,Very bizzare and entertaining,"Although not perfect the film does deliver. It is racy, bizzare, and leaves a smeark on your face. Although I liked ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"" better, I liked this one more than ""Space Jam"""
4,Great! Truly cool.,"Wow! This movie is cool! It's like Japanese Anime, but made by Americans! Rare to see a GOOD animation done by Americans. If you like Anime, you need this! Not the same in a sense, but has more the ""adult"" thrill! A must have!"
1,"Terrible, terrible","I finally got around to seeing Cool World. I wasn't expecting much (heard all the bad reviews when it was released), so I guess I was not disappointed. Cool World is terrible. It's not even ""good-terrible"" in a campy, kitchsy sort of way. It's a miracle that it didn't kill the careers of Pitt, Basinger or Byrne."
3,Its a Cool World,I saw this back when i was a kid i thought it was a cool movie i know its not a good movie but i still like it Brad Pitt was good as a cool world detective Holli Would was one sexy cartoon doodle David Bowie's song at the end of the movie was hella cool i mean it had Its own video game which i use to play a long time ago give this one a shot if you can because Its a real cool world baby
1,Um... I'd rate it garbage,"I watched this because it comes up as a recommended film, like a cult classic. Clearly those critics were high when they saw this movie. This movie is absolutely terrible! There are such huge plot holes that you practically have to go into a concussion to understand what's going on. I'm so surprised that Brad Pitt's career didn't go down the pooper 'cause this movie had bad acting and animation all around. It's incredibly cheesy and at times annoying. At least with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the humans felt like they were interacting with the toons and were physically affected by their presence. This film was like watching amateur mimes. Could they have at least looked in the direction of the toons they were interacting with? It's like they decided to just look left of the camera at all times instead of at the fictional character. >_< If they remake this movie, it can only be for the better."
4,Definitely different,"The concept of this movie is so different. Even with the live-action/animation, sometimes it's a little difficult to keep up. The graphics are great and Kim Bassinger and Brat Pitt do an outstanding performance. I would not recommend this for a family viewing night despite the cartoon graphics."
1,This one really doesn't end!,"I got this movie because I was a big fan of the first two, and I expected this one to be great. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. This movie should never have start production. It is geared too much toward little kids, but I doubt even little kids would be amused by it. The plot has Bastian returning to Fantasia to escape ""The Nasties"", which is some sort of gang. The Fantasia in this movie is very different from the one in the first two. It looks a lot less inviting, and they really screwed up all the beauty that Fantasia possessed in the first two movies. They turn the Childlike Empress into a joke, who even contemplates using the Auryn to go shopping! Michael Ende would die of shame if he were still alive. They turned his wonderful idea into one big joke. This movie should never have seen the light of day."
1,I'd rather vomit and go play in it...,"This movie was so horrible, I was going to sell it in a yard sale. Then I thought... 'that means it will be floating around somewhere else in the world."" So I decided to throw it away, then thought 'what if someone goes dumpster-diving, takes it, and watches it?"" I couldn't live with that! So, I burned it. Bad for the environment, yet good for the general population. The only thing RIGHT about it was that the Rock Biter had the correct, book-version of the name. STILL, if I wanted Cheese, I would have grabbed a bag of Doritos. Mmm... Doritos. ::Walks away to find the Doritos::"
2,It only feels like it never ends.,"The first movie was awesome. The second one was ok. This one is just embarrassing. The only cool things about this movie are that you get to see Jack Black play a school bully, and hear Rock Biter sing ""Born to be Wild"". Other than that, this is a total waste of time.Oh, and if they're going to have a different kid play Bastian in every movie, they could at least make some effort to have them look somewhat alike. They all look completely different. He might as well have been black in one of them.Bad trilogy. Very bad. Just go with the first one, it's the best."
1,An insult to NES fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first Neverending Story was and is one of my favorite movies ever made, I can't get enough of it. After the second one came out they messed everything up and this third one is a joke, a disgrace and an insult to NES fans everywhere. First of all the book and the auryn look nothing like the original. Atreyu isn't in the film nor is he mentioned. The rock biter has shrunk, there is a stupid talking tree and poor Falkor looks like he's going to die off! I swear I think the people that made this movie didn't even bother to watch the original. The Rock Biter singing ""Born To Be Wild?"" You've got to be kidding me?! They should never have made any sequels to this movie unless the original actors, writers and directors were in it. They should have just left well enough alone. Like they say ""If it aint broke, don't fix it"" I wouldn't spend 5 cents on this movie nevermind wasting [$$] on the DVD."
1,"A Dissappointment, Inded","I was and still am a fan of the Neverending Story plot. It has always given me an interesting view of life. I was one of those people who were anxious to see TNES 3 when it came out. Sadly, enough, my expectations weren't met. What in heavens name happened? No more Atreyu? or Artax? Whatever happened to the senior councellor of the child-like empress? Why was he replaced with someone who has a bid head? Why is the child-like empress not a child? I have many more questions about this movie. Falkor, come on now, the lovable luck dragon who always had words of encouragement became dumb. No offense to the creators of the movie but sophomoric/slapstick comedy don't work well with the TNES. Indeed a great dissappointment."
1,OMG this was HORRIBLE,"I saw about 15 minutes of this movie on TV, and I had to change the channel, what a HUGE disapointment! The first movie will always rock forever, the second one isn't as good, but I still liked it......the 3rd movie......FILE THIRTEEN!"
1,I will give it a chance,"I have seen both of the previous chapters of this series. and liked them both! I would love for both one and two to come out on DVD! I have yet too see chapter 3 but i will give it a chance, becasue some people like it and some do not. It probably wont be that great, only becasue it has to live up to higher standards than a movie that is coming out that has no prequels. It should be good, we will see. I know I like Jason James Richter(Free Willy) as an actor, so I am hoping it will be good"
1,Attack of the Clones - RockBaby born a CrackBaby,"A Clone of a Clone with a twice dead soul, this movie is... HUHM!?This will be written off like Halloween 3 or something and a really good one like H20 should come back @ 20 year anniversary.Neverending - The Prequel_____________________________write U'r Congress-personage naw, ya heer!"
2,This was the Dumbest of the series!!,I've seen Part 1&2 they were pretty good this one sucks!!Take my word for it don't waste your money!!I rate this DVD a 2 of 5 stars!!
1,One of the worst fantasy movies of all time!,"Jack Black is the only redeeming aspect of this movie,playing the ringleader of the Nasties.He's the only actor in the whole movie who seems to be having fun.The story has a cheesy premise (Bastian runs away to Fantasia,the Nasties read the book&wreak; havoc)The Rock Biters act ""cool""&have; a terrible version of ""Born to be wild."" Bastian has a creepy crush on his stepsister--and in the end she has to save the day by comparing him to Arnold Schwarzenegger,Hercules&Bruce; Lee(!)This movie is a mishmash.The attempt to meld Fantasia with the ""real world"" wreaks havoc with the script;potentially interesting idea,but it gets wrecked.Avoid this movie,unless you like cheesy fantasy movies."
1,Absolutley Awful,"This movie takes out all of the fun and wonder of the series. The actors are awful, the special effects are worse, and Falcor looks like a stuffed animal. Atreyu is nowhere to be found and Bastian is just pathetic.If you want to know more about the Neverending Story, read the book!"
1,Boring,"I love the NeverEnding Story I & II. The first NeverEnding story was made before I was born but I remember watching it as a 4 year old and that tells you something--it's good. But what happened to part III? It is nothing like the previous parts. I think III was a rush to put together another chapter to this story, but it horribly fails. The writing is crap, production sucks (low budget. could be better), and the magic of I & II is lost. If you're curious to really see how this movie turns out, rent it first."
1,do not buy this movie,"it is the worst thing that i have seen in all of my life. i got this movie knowing that it was going to be bad but i wanted to see becouse i had the other two. the frist movie was great i loved it as a child. i have even got it for my own, when i seen the 2nd one i disliked it not any bit as good as the first 1. but this movie is just a wast of time and money. it is a shame. i sat down to watch this whit my 6 year old. she did even want to see. so dont buy this i know jack black is in it but still dont buy this i could be the worst movie of all time"
3,Its ok...,Ok so this movie looked alot more fake and was not thought out like the other 2 movies. I mean come on falcor didnt even look the same. I didnt like it no where near as much as i liked the first 2.
3,The NeverEnding Story III,Bought this movie so that I could have all three of The NeverEnding Story movies. The first one is by far the best. This one is cheesy but that's not why I bought it.
1,Didn't like it!,"I didn't have a problem with the shipping, cost, etc. I was the movie itself! My family loves the original and even part two since it looks like the same director did it. The 3rd one was completely different! The Oron symbol, Falcor (how can you change the beloved LUCK DRAGON)! If you just want a movie to watch that only has a few names mentioned from the first 2 then buy it you might like it."
1,WWW (What Went Wrong),"I hate this film. I liked the first two films and I was looking forward to watching this. But when I did, I thought it was terrible. I feel so sorry for fans of ""The Neverending Story"", this film is a disgrace to the series and should never been made. The film is so unlike the other two films. Craetures from Fantasia on Earth, the guy who plays as Bastian cant act and the child like emprise suddenly turns into an adult. What a bunch of bull!!"
1,The Neverending Tragedy,"Do you want to know why there are no more ""Neverending Story"" films? This film is the reason. It was a tragic display of ignorance on the part of the producers. They threw away everything that had been established in the previous films and started from scratch. Why did they do this? I have no idea but they definitely ruined the series. There is almost nothing redeemable about this film. It was hard enough getting through the second film but this one was too much.I recommend going back and watching the first one again and not wasting any time with this tragedy."
1,BORING!,"The first one was awesome, the second one was good, this third one is cheesy, I mean really cheesy. Who would want to see this third film of the series? Don't plan on seeing this movie it's a waste of time. I bet the Free Willy kid was disappointed that he had to play Bastain in this boring sequel. I think this movie is just for little kids who are into kid-action stuff."
1,WORST FILM EVER!!!,"This film is the absolute worst of the series. I loved the first Neverending Story and the second one was ok but not as good. This film has almost nothing to do with the book, it's like they just made up an extra story that stinks. This is a bad example of marketing gone bad. There are way too many 90s ish references and the cast was terrible.If you want to see a piece of garbage watch this movie."
1,The Only Thing Good Was..........,"The fact that the kick ass number 1 hit single Crash! Boom! Bang! by Roxette is played at the beginning og this film. Other than that, this film is absoultly terrible, save your money!!!!"
1,The End,"Do you want to know why there are no more ""Neverending Story"" films? This film is the reason. It was a tragic display of ignorance on the part of the producers. They threw away everything that had been established in the previous films and started from scratch. Why did they do this? I have no idea but they definitely ruined the series. There is almost nothing redeemable about this film. It was hard enough getting through the second film but this one was too much.I recommend going back and watching the first one again and not wasting any time with this tragedy."
3,"Just a money making film, but better than II","I was very disappointed at the Never Ending Story II and donated it to Library for children who wish to see it. Two days ago I saw the III in ToysRus for $4.99. This has nothing to do with the original books. However, I have to give the credit to the screen play to try to make it something educating for the new family formed by the previously divorced family. Children are hurting from their past experience and the void of the last parent is hard to make up for. The story move more out of fantasia to the human world and Holloween theme fell into it nicely. I think the director is trying to tell people not to be so nasty toward each other. This is very good because the next generation kid's attitude toward us senior are very rude. I wish the film could be more fun like the original Never Ending Story. The imagination is there, but not enough of it to attrack the attention of the audience. It is more for the teenagers than anyone else."
1,Worse than part 2 (which is an abomination),"As much rage as I feel when I think of how part 2 destroyed the luster of a valid trilogy, THIS ONE just makes me feel sad in my soul.Bastian sucks.Falkor sucks.Atreyu a no show.Rock-biter and son could hardly even amuse toddlers.Stupid stupid stupid. Don't even want to go into just how stupid. I feel like crying.If you helped make this movie - go to hell.If you liked this movie - go to hell.I should sue your insane sins against society."
4,A nice companion to Moore's Writing in the Sand,"This is more of Moore's personal reflections on why he is the religious person he is, and that is helpful to know, and does help widen the view one can take of what living the religious life can be."
3,Eloquent,"I think the concept of nourishing ones' inner life is important but might better be found in Thomas Moore's Care of the Soul and the existential concepts in Freedom and Accountability at Work, by Peter Koestenbaum.In this book Thomas Moore takes us through his spiritual journey which may well be interesting for some and I am sure was cathartic for him. He is also an eloquent writer; to that extent I found merit in his pen and leveraged this inspiration into a few poems myself."
5,Great recording at right price!,"I just saw my first production of this wonderful musical jewel mounted by the Washington National Opera at the Kennedy Center. It was love at first note and I asked a good friend, a real Strauss fan, to recommend a recording.He suggested this one and other AMAZON reviews seemed to confirm it. Well, it is glorious! What a cast and with James Levine at the podium the performance really shines. All are in their prime. Thanks Allan S. and AMAZON.com."
5,Ottoman Glider,"Outstanding quality.Cheaper thatn everyone else on the internet, plus no tax or shipping.Grreat product, my wife loves it."
2,Glider Rocking Chair- Not comfortable,"Purchased this for our daughter while she was pregnant so she could breastfeed our first grandchild in. Expected the chair to be comfortable but was very, very disappointed in the comfort. Cushion uncomfortable and the chair back sits almost straight up instead of somewhat reclined and wrapped around you which would be most comfortable. Would not recommend this...for something so important spend the money for one that slightly reclines and wraps around you so you feel comfortable. Very Disappointed."
3,"Cute, but not real motivational material","My son loved the stickers, but wanted to wear them...not put them on the stickerboard. his motivation ended up being .. here you can have a sticker. For this motivation...it's a little expensive and would probably just go to WMart to get some cheap stickers for this. The sticky on the stickers were not very good either (due to the fact that they were probably meant to be stuck on the stickerboard)."
1,Not worth the money,I was really disappointed by this 'chart.' All it is is a bunch of circles where you are to stick stickers. You could easily download a template like this off the internet. The stickers are also very boring and I ended up getting other character stickers that my son preferred. Wish I had not bought this item.
3,Potty training rewards,This potty training reward book is ok. I didn't really help with my son going potty training. He had no real interest in the stickers. If a child is into stickers then this might be a good item to go with.
3,"Helpful, but could probably make your own chart.","Though the stickers and chart seem to be exciting for my little boy, I could have saved myself some money and just as easily made my own chart and bought cheaper stickers. The pictures weren't that creative, but if you don't have time to make your own, it's probably worth the money."
3,Sort of Works,"At first my son was very into the stickers but has lost interest after about two weeks. It is still nice though to have the chart as a reference and ""bait"" to get him to at least sit on the potty!"
4,Looks fun!,"This book has tons of stickers that are all very different, rather than the same smiley face over and over again. I love that you can implement a bigger reward than stickers at the end of each row. It also has plenty of space for the inevitable many weeks that potty training realistically takes. I only didn't give it 5 stars cause there could be more order to the stickers and there could be more examples of how to use it."
4,Pretty good system,"I got this for my 2 year old son, and at first he was very into it. But, he has lost a little interest. He still wants the stickers and loves putting them on the tracking sheet, but it isn't worth it for him to use his potty chair. He's barely 2, and I am sure he will come around. Some of the stickers are very specific to what they are for, and it's hard when he wants to use those stickers when he hasn't accomplished what the sticker says. I may try this when my daughter is ready for potty training. It has been worth the money so far."
4,Great Incentive!,"My son loves these stickers! They've been a real incentive for him to do his ""business""!"
4,Gets kids excited about potty,"The sticker concept is a great idea. Although the stickers aren't brightly colored and glossy my two year old still jumps up and down with glee when I give him one.Hey, kids love the simplest things and this is a great aid for a child going through the potty training process. Definitly recommended."
5,Lets go potty!,"Do they make these for adults :) This book is so cute and so motivational! The child goes potty and then, as a motivater, picks their own sticker and puts it on their spot on the chart, and what child doesn't like stickers? This makes them feel even ""bigger"" and gives them a huge boost in the right direction, the POTTY!!! The stickers are adorable. The progress calendar would be nice to save also with the baby book. I recommend!"
3,very sticky,My 2 year old loved these but my cat paid the price. They are sticky and pulled off my cats fur where she stuck them all over him.Just make sure to stick them to a chart or something right away when your child earns them. Mr. Miffles is fine now but he did look a little funny for a while.
2,Potty reward stickers - Review,"The stickers themselves are pretty boring and repetative. There are bland pictues of different coloured undies, toilet rolls, cartoon kids sitting on the potty. It hardly seems rewarding to give your son a sticker of a pair of underpants (LOL!!)The value of this product for me, was in the instructions supporting how to use the stickers. That is, to use the stickers to prompt conversation about using the toilet. Eg. ""what happens next"", ""what color are the undies on this sticker"" etc."
3,a little disappointed,"Whilst the concept is good I had it sent to NZ from the US and felt like it was not much for the money. The stickers, whilst all about underwear and toilets have left me wondering if they are 'flash enough' to make a child feel proud. I could have made a chart and brought some stickers for a lot less than the purchase price and, in all honesty, probably got the same reaction from my son. Either way I'm sure the little guy will love it when he gets around to using it, I might just add my own sparkly stars. I also wonder if one chart is going to be enough."
1,Complete waste of money,"This is way too expensive for what you get.Making a chart and using the stickers your child already has would be just as helpful in potty training.The vendor didn't get me the product in a timely manner, either."
5,Great Read!,"Historical setting for a very riveting book. I was drawn into the story and felt like I was a witness, instead of a reader. The characters are complex and well defined. The mark of a good writer is one who can compel the reader to become emotionally invested in the story and the characters. As with all of Nann Dunne's works, this book brings the setting to life and the characters become as real as someone you know. I highly recommend this book!"
1,"Violent, too lengthy","A couple of bad words, too small of a courtship in the romance part of the story, and that most feared for girls in combat took place. I would have preferred to not have read this book (or that the Civil War happened, for sure)."
3,A Pleasant Regency Romance,"This is a continuation of the Notorious Series and is the story of Kell and Raven.Although I have read the others in this series I did not feel that this was as good as the others. The plot was a bit thin and at times I was not sympathetic to Raven. I understood why she did what she did and why she felt the way she felt but after awhile I was thinking ""get over it and move on"". I am sure that this was not the way Ms. Jordan met for me to feel but there you have it.The romance between the two main characters was a bit thin in the beginning and it took a long time before I felt that there was anything between them, and the plot as I stated earlier was also a bit thin. The saving grace for me was a fact that characters from previous books in this series are part of this story, and it is set in a time period that I like. This book also has the trademark sensuality that Ms. Jordan is famous for. Still worth reading and I look forward to the next book in this series."
3,Disappointment in the H&h relating to each other,"""Ecstacy"" by Nicole Jordan. The on and off feelings of the couple didn't feel like a romance nor was there even sexual tension building up to a romance or love; it was more like occasional desperate sex. I hung on until about page 323 and just got bored with the H&h. I tried a few times to finish it, but just didn't like any of the people well enough to care how it ended. I gave it 3 stars because the first half did hold my interest in a bizarre sort of way. (Because I enjoyed reading ""To Bed a Beauty"" and ""Wicked Fantasy"" by the same author, I will try a couple more.)"
2,Maybe Nicole Jordan just isn't for me,"This is my second book by Jordan, but I'm not very impressed. Oh, it certainly had its moments, but despite some really emotional inner struggles, the book as a whole didn't often move me, although I liked it better than the other one.The love scenes too seldom move the plot forward in any significant manner, and they often skirt the border of what's acceptable for me personally. The middle of the book were terribly slow, and while I rather liked Kell, I wasn't too fond of Raven. Most of the secondary characters and the plot points were weak, tired, or overused.All in all, I think I'm done with Nicole Jordan for a while. It just wasn't worth my time (except perhaps as an exercise in what I don't like)."
4,Ecstasy,"I enjoyed the read. The characters are what makes this book not the sex scenes although it is sexy. They are two lost souls who manage to get together and ""repair"" each other. I liked the ending a lot also. It was a surprise."
2,Disappointed,"I am very pleased with the time of delivery. However, this header board clearly is NOT FOAM. When I opened the package, I was disappointed to see the board had three creases down the center. Sadly, I cannot use this for a presentation as planned."
5,GREAT,I was glad to get this item quickly. I was unable to find it in a local store so I was glad you had it here.
3,wrong color,"I ordered this twice. Both times we received a purple one with pink buttons.My son was hoping for the green one shown.The second time I ordered it, it was twice the size of the first one I ordered.It does not say that it is available in colors other than the green one that is shown. Not happy with order.It will cost more than it's worth to return it and reorder another one."
3,Back to the 80s,"My grandmother wanted this pair of earmuffs. They are cheaply made, but if you are looking for a pair that was popular in the 80s, this is it."
2,Very disappointed,"Am getting ready to return the ear muffs. The first time I put them on one of the ear muffs popped off and could not be replaced. In addition, there was little to no flexibility to the plastic band to which they were attached."
1,Don't buy these-way too tight,"The ""adjustable"" earmuffs were way too tight! Not only too tight on on my skull, but they were almost impossible to even open to put on my head. I returned them."
2,Almost impossible to get on,My wife can't get the earmuffs on by herself. I can get them on her with a struggle. Hopefully as time goes on the plastic band will not be so curled up tight and relax.
4,Good or the price,"I bought these earmuffs to wear while running when it's cold or Windy. These work just fine. The plastic head band is a little stiff, but the muffs fit well on my ears and the earmuffs stay put during my run. Good product for the price."
1,Deceptive sizing.,"What appeared to be a great buy was anything but! One would think that if an accessory is sold to fit it would be sized by the item it fits, not its own. My exhaust is 3 inches so I ordered this item in the 3 inch size. The item is supposed to slip over the tailpipe but the dimension of 3 inches refers not to the tailpipe it will fit, but to the item's diameter making it the exact same size as the tailpipe and thus, it will not fit over it like it is supposed to. DO NOT buy as returning it will cost more than than paid for the item."
3,RIP James Dean,"Before this book, my knowledge of James Dean was very limited. I had seen Rebel Without a Cause many years ago. I knew Dean had died in a car accident before the movie was even released. That was the extent of my knowledge of the late, great Mr. James Dean.I was prompted to buy this book because I wanted to know more about the alleged ""curse"" of James Dean's car. I was a bit saddened that only a couple of pages actually discussed the ""curse"" of Dean's 550 Porsche Spyder. The first half of the book discussed a lot that happened September 30, 1955--the day James Dean died. Many conflicting reports, witness statements, etc. The second half of the book dives into Dean's loyal following and those obsessed with the crash that killed him.Overall, this was a decent read for those like myself with limited knowledge of James Dean."
5,"Comprehensive, Objective and Fascinating","Warren's book continues to outshine most every other Dean book. Granted, this is my particular area of interest, but I would challenge anyone to read this and not be enthralled. Dean's last days are meticulously researched, rumors addressed... Warren doesn't try to pretty it up. This is the way things happened. I refer to this book often - it's a bible in my home."
5,A book that tells what the title says (for once!),"The focus of this book is the automobile crash that ended the life of actor James Dean. Dean only ever made three movies but those three had a huge impact on folks of that period.In any case, the details given here will present you with a clearly defined account of why and how this youth noir-icon died.He was on his way to a race, in a racecar, when a young man pulled out from an intersecting highway. So, the question arises, 'Was Dean's speed the cause of the spectacular crash or, was it carelessness on the young man's part who possibly failed to yield the right-of-way?' (HINT: Dean was just issued a speeding ticket about an hour or so before the crash!)This book has plenty of nice illustrations and I found it a real page-turner of a mini-biography."
1,Order I never received,"Sorry, but I never received this book even tho my credit card was charged. I wrote Amazon previously but heard nothing back. Suppose someone could check on this for me? Diane McCammon"
4,Bridget Loves Frankenbernie,"The TBBOM is a very well-described memory of a time when Bridget still loved Bernie and mucky-green bell-bottoms were on their first round of fashion. Like a Supressed Memory Recovery artist, Jim GLADSTONE reminds us why we gave up eating Count Chocula, despite the prize at the bottom of the box. He takes us on a journey that some us never wanted to be on in the first place, but had no say in the matter. We've all been through, ""If I have to stop this car, my belt's coming off"". GLADSTONE reminds us that, regardless of who we've grown into today, our destiny was shaped by a little brother's fear of a Satanic night light or a father's absolute disbelief of a family broken up. After finishing this Psych-Time Travel novel, you will end up right where you should be - asking yourself how you got here but thankful that you do not have to go back."
5,Absorbing fictional look into a colorful subculture,"You can't really relate to another man's (or woman's) obsession, but ""Cockfighter"" does a impressive job of drawing the reader into the psyche of Frank Mansfield, the single-minded hero of this pretty intense novel. Frank's goal in life is to win the Cockfighter of the Year award, and he's taken a vow not to speak another word until he does so. In relating silent Frank's journey, the author takes us on a memorable trip through the cockfighting pits of the Southern U.S. and allows us a close-up look at the rugged, obsessive, fiercely individualistic types who haunt them. You will learn from this novel virtually everything you could conceivably wish to know about cockfighting; the details feel absolutely authentic. Above all, though, it's a convincing portrait of a man driven half-mad by his private demons."
1,"Great devotion, but not this translation","I have a great devotion to the Blessed Mother. I try to say the rosary every day, but when I can't, I say the Little Office. The copy I had (Red cover) fell apart and so I ordered both this copy and the ""Blue"" copy. I didn't like either one. I'm a traditional Catholic and really don't like any changes made by VCII. Unfortunately, this translation is a ""newly revised"" translation and I really can't get used to it. The ""Glory Be"" is not like the way I learned it when I was an Altar boy and it is just too modern for me.If you want a ""tradition"" translation, this is NOT it.Phil Haase"
3,Disappointing,"Great anthology badly edited. Editor sees to apologize for this being an academic book. In retrospect I probably should have gone to the original sources - Berger, Sontag, Barthes et al. If you're new to photo theory then this is probably a useful crib. Disappointing"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GREAT WHILE I FOUND A SINGER WHO MAKES' ME BELIEVE HE KNOWS' WHAT HE IS SINGING ABOUT. SURE DOES' TAKE THE EDGE OFF ALL THE PLASTIC ON THE RADIO RIGHT NOW. MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU KEITH. I REALLY ENJOYED DON'T LIE IN MY ARMS
5,Any Doubts I had about the Governing Body were Dispelled,"If you have doubts about Jehovah's Witnesses, THIS is the book to start with. Before I read this, I figured that the Watchtower Society might have some doctrinal problems, but I thought that they were decent, well-meaning folks. This book showed me just how controlling -- even Machiavellian -- they can be.The astonishing thing about this book is that its tone is so mild. Ray Franz was treated very badly indeed by the Watchtower power structure, but he never sounds nasty in his book. His gentle tone inspired me when I created my web site (Beyond Jehovah's Witnesses); I decided that I would never sound bitter or take cheap shots.If you're a Jehovah's Witness, you are not supposed to read a book like this. The rule has its purpose: this book will let you see just how the Watchtower Society really operates -- as seen by somebody who was at the very top of the organization. It's not a pretty sight."
4,"Very Interesting, but left confused","I could not put this book down when I started reading it. I am an inactive JW, but I was sitting in the Kingdom Hall when the announcement was made that Raymond Franz was disfellowshipped. I was devastated. So I was so glad to get the opportunity to read his book. I only wished I would have read it sooner. The feeling I got from the things he wrote is that he never questions the truth, but the way that it was delivered. The judgemental attitude of these imperfect men."
5,This book helped me open my eyes,Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to everone who is a Jehovah's Witness or knows one. When I first started questioning their teachings this book was given to me and opened my eyes.
3,Crisis of Confidence,"The web information about the author and excerpts led to an interest in the book. After receiving it, I thought better of reading it and put it on the shelf. Not sure any literature on this topic will ever be balanced or objective."
5,Eye Opener,"If you have any questions about your involvement with the JW's you need to read this book. You will never feel the same about that organization again. Especially if you have been a witness. If you are an outsider you will probably be confused by a lot of the things said and the ""learned language"" that it contains. Don't be afraid to read it tho."
4,Ignore the irrational thoughts of Heinz Schmitz's review..,"If one followed reviewer Heinz Schmitz's reasoning out to a full conclusion then God should feel bad for authoring the Bible. As the Bible has been used by millions throughout history to promote hate, bigotry, and violence."
5,23 Minutes in Hell,"The book arrived in excellent condition. It was rated as not new, but it certainly lived up to new condition. Speedy delivery"
2,Outdated Edition - Crisis of Conscience,"I was very disappointed that the seller didn't let me know that I was buying the outdated edition of the book, therefore rendering it useless to me. A lot of the info was outdated/changed and have been updated in the latest edition."
5,Indeed a Crisis of Conscience,"As I was starting reading this book, I realized that I wasn't the only one with ""crisis of conscience"". What I like about this book is that it also contains countless quotations and referrals to the Watchtower megazines and the other publications so that I could look into my Watchtower Library CD Rom. Yes, I've seen the arrogance of the Watchtower Society especially in the child molestation case...."
1,Didnt work!,We bought these for 6 of our doors. We had the locks on the doors for only 15 minutes till our 2 year old...he had JUST turned two...was able to open the doors even with the locks on them. lol. Buy at your own risk...just hold onto the packages.
2,The Hole Has Got To Go!,"The hole in the middle is just the right size for little fingers to get in. My son realized this immediately. They manufacturers really need to think of a more clever design. The covers did however successfully keep me out when I needed to open the door. I therefore think it should be called ""parentproof""."
1,Junk,"Assuming your child was born with 2 functioning hands, don't waste your money. My cat could figure these things out."
2,Shouldn't have a hole in it,This item got me thru until my son is now 3 and a half. He now realizes he can stick his finger in the hole of the door knob proofer and open every door in the house . I now have to search for one without a hole at the end.
1,2 year old figured it out in less than 5 minutes,I was so excited when I bought these door knob covers as I thought I would finally be able to keep my 2 year old out of the bathroom. He figured it out in a matter of minutes (in fact I think it made it easier because now he had some leverage). Now were back to locking the door and opening it with a credit card (kind of hard to explain when we have guests).
1,waste of money,The wine glasses slide off. It was a waste of my money. Bad design as the rods need to be slanted upward so glasses don't slide off. No instructions!
3,Pegs become loose so beware,"I purchased one of these because it was the most practical thing I could find for my kitchen. When I was away for a few weeks, I came home to find one of my favorite glasses had fallen off and broken. I don't know if possibly I didn't tighten the pegs enough, but I swear that I did so I think they become loose over time. And since it is attached to the wall it is a pain to take it down and re-tighten them so I would prefer not to have to do this. Over all it is a decent idea for a product just not as reliable as I would have hoped."
4,She Could Not Afford to Fall In Love...,"Once Miss Amaryllis Duvane had been the reigning beauty of the London season, about to marry the man of her dreams and live and love happily ever after.Then her father died. Suddenly Amaryllis was penniless and alone, forced to survive on teh charity of relatives who made her little more than a servant to their husband-hunting daughters.Now the lord that Amaryllis had once loved - the magnificently handsome Marquess of Merechester - had come to court one of these daughters. And the only thing Amaryllis feared more than his discovering the sad state to which she had descended, was her finding out that she still wanted him so heartbreakingly much..."
5,Great knife,One of the best Vicotorinox pocket knives made. This has everyting you would need in a multi-tool pocket knife without all the bulk. Great for EDC!!!
5,Awesome!,This was my first pocket knife and I love it! It has the tools that it mentioned and more! It is awesome.
4,Love the knife - but I might not be its first owner,"I absolutely love the ""Climber"". I first received on in 2001 as a gift and it was by far my favorite Swiss Army knife I had ever owned. The blades and tools that are built into the knife seem to suit most of my needs while not creating a handle that is an inch thick.The only issue that I have with the knife is that there is a skuff on the black surface of the knife so that it is no longer shiny. Although I realize that this would probably occur fairly quickly during my own use, I was highly disappointed to find it on a newly purchased knife.(As a side note, as another review states; the description does list a 'wire stripper', which it does not have. However, the picture is accurate and I knew what I was getting when I purchased so I did not take any stars off for this)"
4,NICE!,"Very nice willow barrier/fence. I used this around my pool and it looks great. A little expensive, but hopefully it will last."
4,Krasno in the Background,"Great music but being a Krasno fan, I think his presence on this album is too limited. The sax seems to in the front most of the time."
1,New direction for Soulive,"Not sure where these guys are headed, but I'm heading in the opposite direction. My sentiments echo what many have already said: ""Overproduced"", ""smooth"", etc. ""Next"" was such a disappointment considering how much I liked ""Doin' Something"". I wonder who's really behind this, Soulive or Bluenote (or both). And before everyone gets all crazy, I'm all for a band trying new things, growing musically, yada, blah, whatever, but this is such a departure from their previous sound that I just can't sponsor it.Despite my negative review, I do applaud the band for trying to reach out to a wider audience. I just wish they hadn't compromised their sound as much as they did."
2,background music,"This is the soundtrack for a day of browsing through chain bookstores.I was very dissapointed. Krasno is an afterthought in this soulless, studio born album.Im waiting for the REAL follow up to Doin Something."
3,"good, but not great...","the addition of vocal talent, although still resulting in some chill tracks, really takes away from soulive's musical talent. at least half of the album seems to be mainly comprised of looped, downbeat samples creating, in effect, melodies that resemble high school ""slow dance"" songs rather than the band's prior jazzy urban tunes. the remainder of the album holds true to the band's earlier days, but while noticably soulive, ends up coming across more as background music you'd hear on the weather channel. not their best work..."
3,Joyful Girl - A wonderful Ballad,"Despite the violent objections to Dave Matthews' song on this review site, I on the other hand thought it a refreshing change from Soulive's usual charged-up fare. Fusion may be fun, but ballads are in no way inferior. The fact is, jazz is all-encompassing in styles and thus malleable. THIS is the point that most reviewers here missed out --- they obviously prefer only a certain genre (fusion). Take it from an objective music-appreciator: ""Joyful Girl"" will melt you all over and create the perfect ambience for an evening with your lady / man. Dave Matthews' voice is also wonderful.As for the REST of the album, well, the other reviewers seemed fair in their critique, so read them."
1,"I paid for this book, you never sent it to me","Yes, you guys never resolve the issue on this matter. I was charged on my credit card and I have not received this book. I wrote you twice and never got an answer from you. So now you still got my money and I have no book. Nice."
1,Terrible quality!,"I bought two of these watchbands in different sizes, one for me and another one for my husbands, since our original rubber ones had both broken. We were excited when we received them because they looked great and had good fit.The product's quality is just awful, both velcros came off after just two months of use (mine and my husbands) and I had to sew them back on with nylon. Then the velcro came off again... We just gave up.I would have returned it if I didn't live abroad de US.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT!"
3,It's cheap. It does the job.,"It is cheaply made, but seems to hold together OK. I don't expect it to last forever, but in the meantime, it keeps my filters organized."
2,"Not useful, Better to pay more and grab good stuffs","The seller probably has a different pics uploaded for this product. The build quality for the items is not good. I would say it is better to ""not buy"" then to buy at all and give the 3 dollar something(cost of the wallet) to charity instead.I would suggest the seller to remove the 2nd picture of the product so that buyers are not misled. Basically as soon as the items arrived i opened it and threw it to trash ( I am sorry to say this). I understand that I shouldn't expect a robust wallet for this cost but atleast I would say I was misled by the image (2nd image)uploaded for this."
2,It's OK,"The good:It protects the filtersAdequate paddingFits quite large filters (77mm should go in)LightThe bad:Burgundy color (yuck)Similar but not what is picturedWhen storing small filters (52mm) they flop around quite extensively. As a matter of fact one needs to close the wallet in a careful, special way so that the filters in the bottom 2 pockets don't slide down and almost out. The description states it holds filters up to 62mm, which is BS, I just put a 72mm one in and it fits quite nice with plenty of room to spare. I got it for my set of 52mm filters and it is just way too large. However, if you do get it to store 72mm+ filters you may not be able to close the flap completely because of resulting thickness.In all, for ~$10 I did not expect miracles, but I did expect better. This, it seems, would have been better spent on few cups of coffee. Need to take a trip to a brick store to find something that actually works as needed."
1,Image is Wrong,The item shown in the image is not the item that arrived. What I received was MUCH lower in quality that what is shown (rather than mesh it is cheap plastic sheeting). Overall construction also feels very cheap (some stitches are loose plus the Velcro isn't properly attached). On top of all that the item arrived USPS with postage due!
3,Much Better Than Previous Version,"Pension books are like Y2k Survival Guides. Once the year in question is over, what good is the book? That's what you run into with Pension books nowadays, material that has to be updated on a yearly basis or it's woefully out of date.As I mentioned in a previous review of the 1996/97 version of this book, it was lacking in the compliance and regulatory sections. These sections are KEY to understanding pension plans.As a former student of Dearborn's security texts, I can tell you they are THE source for any of the securities exams - absolute top notch. But when it comes to pensions, they need to incorporate more detail and focus separately on defined contribution and defined benefit plans."
1,Not Worth the Time,"Mr. Akbar's ""effort"" is a book suffering from its fair share of inaccuracies. Stanley Wolpert's biography of Nehru is far better, providing a more honest and objective portrayal about a man who was from being the indomitable giant Mr. Akbar makes him to be."
2,Mildly Interesting,"Bought this book to read on a trip to Las Vegas. The descriptions of the casinos and how they operated were interesting. However, Morgan Crew vacillated between being a push-over and being hot-tempered and obnoxious, as if the author couldn't quite decide on his character, and despite that, I somehow kept feeling I was in an old rerun of ""Hart To Hart"". It was flabby, rather like Mr. Crew.A note to the publisher--books need editors, not just running a spell-checker. I've never read a book with so many errors before (""then"" instead of ""than"", ""it's"" instead of ""its"" and many others). But this is the first iUniverse book I've read..."
1,Long winded,The book focuses too much on theoretical approaches. The methods are presented in a verbose manner. A lot of the information is irrelevant for practical use.
1,too theoretical,"Good for the classroon, not the real world. Almost a total emphasis on disocunted cash flow, not used much by most practitioners."
4,Excellent review of several valuation techniques though...,"Professor Damodaran wrote the most comprehensive introductory books on Valuation I ever read. He covers discounted cash flow, relative valuation and the -still- less accepted contingent claim valuation. In addition, he presents simple solutions to complicated problems. Having in mind its introductory and (almost) self-teaching nature, the book is hard to criticize. Nevertheless, a couple of things should be mentioned to warned the potential reader. First, several issues that Damodaran presents as (almost) unquestionable are actually a matter of dispute among financial analytst. Second, multifactorial models -APT like- deserve much more analyisis. Third, the lack of emphasis on international investments is striking. Fourth, it lacks an analysis on preparing/estimating proforma financial statements. It might seem as a lot of objections but they are not... The book is a must."
2,The book does not go beyond basics of most subjects touched,"I will not receommend this book for an MBA Investment Finance elective level. It is just too basic in most areas, for that purpose. On the other hand, I have already recommended it to most people who wanted to develop their understanding of stock fundamentals entirely on their own. Since I am a teacher, I would like to see the author include more depth and examples specially in the areas of free cash flows based valuation. Secondly, I would like the area of debt leverage and its impact on stock's stand-alone risk, to be given a more extensive coverage."
3,Promising future,"The book is enjoyable--a quick and easy read. The author, however, like his main character, does have some growing to do."
3,I'm in another minority on this one,"The writing style is pleasant for the most part. But I found the ""hero"" Derek too annoying, immature and self-centered to really feel connected with what was going on. For instance, he comes cross country to a funeral and stays with his aunt who just suffered the loss, and whom he hardly ever sees but loves, then goes out for a one-night-stand with a man he just met. (Plus he was constantly described as smoking. Another turn-off.)The mystery was ok in itself. I think the author would do well to retire Derek and use his talents to create stories around a more appealing character. Then I might try another one of his books. I don't plan to spend another 200 pages with Derek."
1,Don't Bother,I'm sure there are ten year olds who could come up with a better novel then this. The lead character is so immature and over dramatic he is enough to keep all closeted gay men with their wives.I don't even know how this thing got published.
2,Thin,"I hate to sound a negative note among all the enthusiastic reviewers here, but I just didn't find this book very enjoyable and had to struggle to finish it (fortunately it's pretty short). The main character is colorless, to put it mildly (perhaps he seemed especially so because I just finished a book by Rick Copp, whose protagonist is particularly interesting), the motivation for the characters' actions never quite rings true (the ""solution"" to the mystery was especially disappointing), and the characters themselves are neither fully-developed enough to be interesting nor weird enough to be entertaining.The book is really more of a soap opera than a mystery: it's full of family business intrigue, issues of incest, long-buried secrets, and other soap-opera business. If you like Passions, you might enjoy this one!"
5,Great twist to this story,I have to say I never expected the turn out that happened at the end of this book. I was completely taken by surprise but totally loved the twist since I am usually the type that can figure out endings way in advance.
5,Fingering the Family Jewels,Once you start reading this book you can't put it down. This was one of the bests reads I have experience in a long time. The character development and suspense were intriguing. I enjoyed it so much I reread the book.
1,piece of junk,I totally agree with the guy above who was disappointed with this. I saw an interview with Chris Ryan where he said that he was really angry about the makers of this movie not adhering to the true events of the story. The movie suggests that Chris Ryan was the only serious guy in the patrol and the rest were a bunch of glory hungry morons that were constantly annoyed with Ryan. Ryan himself said that this movie is rubbish. don't waste your time.
1,didnt like it... SPOILERS!!!!,"i got so sick of the hero's moody daughter, she was such a nightmare, plus she was selfish. before i say anything i just want to say im against abortions even though i do believe a woman has a right to choose what she does with her body, i'd rather a child be adopted than killed. but the heros kid had the choice of strangers raising her kid or her dad, and b-c she was selfish and could bear to see her child everday she chose to give her kid away to people that could do god knows what to her kid, does her own feelings mean more to her than her childs safety? if i had to choose between family and strangers, id rather my family raised my child, no matter how painful it would be to see the baby everyday. she claimed that seeing her fathers newborn would pain her, yet she seems to very easily accept him into the family. i dont know it was just an annoying book."
1,Very poor DVD player,"All the features seem impressive for the money. However it takes a lot of pain to make it work reasonably, (that is smoothly), and after finally making it work, I have been unable to watch ONE movie or concert without some kind of freezing, ""pixelization"" of the screen at least ten times during the playback. (It doesn't matter whether the movie is zone 1, unrated or after modifying the flash memory to make it multizone reader. It is a nightmare)The only feature that works effortlessly, is MP3 playback, though the titles get truncated after 8 characters.In brief don't flush your money through the toilet."
2,Not what I hoped for.,"The author obviously knows a lot about model railroading. And he seems to want to share it. But I couldn't get past the feeling as I read it that he was saying ""Look at what I did, isn't it great?"" And""My way is the right way, don't try any other way.""I didn't really find it helpful."
3,razoavel,"o livro é razoavel, apresenta o aspecto da construo de uma ferrovia, no mais que um assunto estendido que poderia ser publicado na revista model railroader, poderia ter todas as fotos coloridas, no é to indispensável, ajuda mas no muito. Poderia ter um preo mais baixo."
3,OK- the bigger one is probably better,"I bought this to play with with my 18 month old daughter because she loves the magnadoodle. I of course realize that this is something she'd need to grow into, but thought it would be fun for me in the meantime. The lines are very faint and don't erase very well. I remember the larger version from my childhood being a much better quality. It might just be the size that's the issue."
2,Design has changed! Please be aware!,"I'm an Etch A Sketch enthusiast (stop laughing). ""Pocket"" used to be my favorite size, but as of around September 2012 the design has gotten smaller. Instead of 4.25"" x 3.75"" (2.75"" x 2"" drawing area), it is now 3.75"" by 3.25"" (2.25"" x 1.5"" drawing area). This makes it far less usable and doesn't really make it any more portable, since it's still 1.5"" thick. I'm really, really unhappy with this change, but I suppose that's mostly my preference. I will probably need to use ""travel"" size now.The main problem is that the current image and dimensions on the product page here are misleading. I'll try to add a picture showing the relative sizes.It is worth noting that drawing and erasing seem to work just fine."
4,fun,always a fun toy...take along in the car;;;keeps the darlins busy for the moment..and doesn't take up too much room
2,Overpriced for being a travel size.,Overpriced for being a travel size. Not overly impressed with the product but will do for the gag gift it is intended for.
5,Pocket Etch A Sketch,"I used to keep extra crayons and coloring books on hand as gifts, and sometimes just stress relievers. The Pocket Etch A Sketch is one of my new items to keep on hand. Recently, I have given this fun item to more adults than children. It is a great stress reliever. I have purchased these as graduation gifts for two of my classmates for our upcoming leadership graduation class. A friend recently celebrated his 50th birthday. Since he is an architect, I labeled his gift ""50+ Drafting/Drawing Tool."" I am currently making a basket of retro type toys for a family. The basket has a few Pocket Etch A Sketches included. Pocket Etch A Sketch makes a good stocking stuffer too!"
4,Cute retro gag gift!,"My stepdad has a thing for etch-a-sketches, and when I saw this little one I had to buy it for him for Christmas! He loved it."
4,Lines are a little small,"The lines are little thin, and it takes a lot of shaking to erase, and even then it doesn't erase completely. But it's fun and cheap."
5,"Incredible, best of 99!","An incredible CD. Contemporary and traditional at the same time. Mala Ganguly on vocals is just amazing! Much better than the most Asian Underground stuff(see Talvin Singh, Asian Dub Foundation) Those guys make you wanna get up and dance while ""Shri Durga"" just takes you into a deep, spiritual experience. To me, the best thing coming out of this musically boring year.."
5,Great Fusion remixes of tradition Indian Devotional Music,"DJ Cheb I Sabbah's ""Shri Durga"" and ""Krishna Lila"" are two of my favorite Fusion remixes of traditional Devotional Music. He seamlessly blends, remixes, and overdubs tracks from ragas containing organic traditional instruments and vocals with a modern upbeat tempo and basslines. He creates a great fusion sound. If you like Indian Fusion and you like ""real"" traditional instruments without a lot of electronic keyboard, I highly recommend these two albums."
3,Don't believe the hype....,"I have many ""Ethno-Techno"" albums and this is not one of the best ones. Maybe ""D.J"" stands for ""Doesn't Jam"", because the until the 5th track (and there are only 7) the DJ doesn't show up. The fusion of Indian and electronica is done much better on many more albums. If you have Joi, Midival Punditz, Tabla Beat Science, Badmarsh & Shri, Karsh Kale (try Redesign)or others, than don't count on this album delivering the same. Do your self a favor, pick up any one of those artists mentioned first before you buy this."
3,"More traditional than MahaMaya, but still enjoyable","Those of you expecting a Transglobal Underground or Temple of Sound or Govinda feel to this disc might be somewhat dissapointed. It comes across as more of a traditional ragas collection with electronic / DJ elements added in. The CD is quite listenable, but don't expect a whole disc full of 'global techno'.That being said, this CD is very enjoyable. The vocals on the various songs are quite different from each other (compare 'Mare Kabu' to 'Shri Durga' for example), and the mix of mostly male Hindu and Muslim vocalists works well. The disc leans to the atmospheric side, with many environmental sounds in the mix. Even the faster or harder songs (like the more techno-focused 'Ganga Dev' and 'Radhe Krishna') have a breezy lightness about them.For me, this is a morning CD. It goes well with the bright early sun, hardwood floors, and a strong cup of tea."
5,A unique syncretic mix,"I've been listening to the ""Asian Underground"" for some years and Shri Durga's syncretic mix takes the fusion of Indian music and beats to a new level. In the June 99 The Wire Richard Henderson says that Cheb i Sabbah is one of the perks of living in San Francisco. I would say it's one of the privileges. In addition to being a great album, Shri Durga is also a great collection of dance tracks, all with superb organic beats. The Cheb's is my favorite DJ set in the city. The tracks from Shri Durga, and the remixes by TransGlobal Underground, Fun Da Mental, Bally Sagoo, Talvin Singh, State of Bengal, and others, take his sets where others don't go."
4,GOOD WORK,I recently bought this cd from amazon.com..It is a really good cd..You can sense the real Indian music here.Strongly recommended to world music fans.You can trust Dj Cheb Sabbah if you see his name on a label...
5,A jar candle must have,"These candle warmer pads work great. You know how the candle never burns evenly and you always have an inchor two of wax left in the bottom, maybe the wick is gone, or the wick has reached the metal and won't light. Put it on the pad and it warms the wax. I have three. But let me tell you, I did not pay $12.99 for them. Thet are really only $3-4 bucks at a craft store like AC Moore, or Michaels. They work great for wax tarts too, just use a left over jar candle that you may have hanging around."
1,dose not warm any candel,"I ordered 3 candle warmer in amazon.com for $25 each and after several days dose not warm the candle and very little scent, the seller dose not accept return"
4,good for unattended watering,"This kit contains lengths of tubing and small soaker hose that can be very useful for setting up a customized watering system if you have several outdoor plants that are fairly near each other. When combined with an automatic timer, it was great for watering some plants that were temporarily set outside while we were gone on vacation. In some situations you could use this indoors, but you would have to be careful that the soaker-hose portion did not leak on anything."
2,Really bad,"The screen writer uses all of cliche' know in the world. The acting horrendous and the special effects are easily duplicated on any computer. So you are probably wondering why, I gave it 2 star rating. It is so appalling and inferior, you have to wonder, can I make a film like this and sell it? It is implausible to say the least."
4,eeuphoria,I have used this product for years and would have replenished my supply sooner but price way to expensive. I bought the original trio of after shave cologne and shave balm at Tj Max for same price as the after shave. Price is absurd .That.k you
3,"Not bad, just not as good as most Wolfe","I like Gene Wolfe a lot. The Fifth Head of Cerberus is one of the best and most intricate SciFi books ever written. The Book of the New Sun is very entertaining AND literate - not a common combination for the genre. The Devil in a Forest isn't quite on the same level...It was obviously written for a younger audience as previous reviewers have pointed out, and though it still maintains some of the level of characterization I expect from Wolfe, the writing just isn't as complex as that found in his other works. Yet, the Wolfe-themes of the indeterminancy of Good and Evil are there -- as well as a critical look at religion and superstition.Consequently, I don't recommend it to anyone other than those who find reading other Wolfe difficult, and hardcore Wolfe fans who wish to complete the bookshelf."
3,Quick Read,"The story revolves around Mark, a young apprentice weaver, and the small village that he lives in as they go through the trials and tribulations of dealing with a highwayman, an elderly lady with an evil heart who may or may not be a witch and the soldiers who are sent in to deal with the highwayman. Wolfe is able to capture the persona of Mark quite well as he struggles to realize that the adults around him are not all powerful or perfect and that even at his young age, he may be more equipped to deal with some of the stressful situations then they are.It doesn't appear that this is one of Wolfe's customary stories. There were no stories within stories and it didn't appear that the reader needed to be paying extreme attention to every detail to gather everything that is going on, both on screen and off screen. Also, Mark appeared to be an at least mostly reliable narrator. All in all a quick read that was enjoyable, but definitely not my favorite of Wolfe's novels."
4,A slight but (of course excellent) book by Wolfe,"This book is aimed at a younger audience than Wolfe's other works. It would probably appeal to intelligent young teens or preteens more than Peace or The Death of Dr Island etc., the books I would recommend to adults reading him for the first time. If you've read his other novels or want to introduce a young friend to this greatest of contemporary fantasy writers, don't hesitate to try this. The Devil in a Forest has surprising depths and is probably Wolfe's most successful work as Bildungsroman."
3,Folk Diva Delivers,"As a great fan of Judy's, I was delighted with this folk compilation. With lush orchestration and Judy's crystalline voice, fans of her folk side will take particular joy from the very moving ""Barbara Allen"" and ""Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair."" I have only heard Joan Baez' interpretation of the latter and found Judy's somber, pensive version the highlight of the CD. Though I enjoy Judy's interpretation of more contemporary songs and love her original music, she brings an almost angelic purity to traditional folk songs and hearing these new recordings is magic."
2,Not the best idea to buy this book,"Excellent text, horrible edition. Sure, the price is good and the fact that you get all 4 volumes of The History of Napoleon in one book make this version tempting, but the quality of the print is so bad and the size of the book is so huge that most likely you will not get very far reading this. Better find copies of separate volumes in the library or buy them. However, the full version is also openly available online. It shouldn't be hard to find."
1,Does Not Work!,"Bought one of these at Linens and Things for $14.99. The ground meat sticks and falls apart making it impossible to get a patty. We tried using Pam, that did not help. Just bad design."
4,great product,This is a great product for making 1/3 - 1/2 lb. burger patties. The slats that the press makes in the patty helps keep the burger nice and flat when cooking. I found that a small sheet of parchment (or wax) paper on the bottoms solves the sticking issues noted by other reviewers.
4,Good Book,"From the Book: Cindy was a daring little girl who wanted to be a smuggler. She had a couple of willing assistants in Emmet and Hank, plus lots of opportunity trying to sneak things through the British blockade in the War of 1812. She was the ringleader and got them all involved in plots, mystery and danger. In addition to exciting adventures, the tree had time for fun digging for buried treasures on Cape Ann at a colorful period of American history.First I must say I'm not a young reader which is who this book is intended for; nevertheless I did really enjoy reading it. Even though this book is fiction, I believe it gives you a good idea of how living in coastal America was during this time. The mystery and adventures were engaging and the characters were likable. I would recommend this book to any kid."
4,"Pretty good, but..","I ordered the white belt with black buckle. Belt arrived with a small, but noticable scratch on the front of the buckle. Otherwise good quality; obviously it still fits and I wear it all the time."
3,"Nice, but it doesn't have the cross","This belt is nice, and good for the price. I'm sad because it doesn't have de cross that they promisse in the picture."
1,Careful! This is not the novel - it's an adaptation for theatre,"Heads up - although it isn't clearly stated here, this is not the novel ""Midnight's Children."" It's an ""adaptation for the theatre by Salman Rushdie, Simon Reade and Tim Supple."" I thought I was purchasing the novel. Amazon needs to make this clear!"
5,A Testimony to What the Human Spirit Can Endure,"These authors have such an amazing way of conveying emotions and the healing process. It is so powerful and touches such a deep part of the soul. In a Dark Time left me feeling as if I know this man and could feel his pain and then his rediscovery and growth. The story was so gripping that I couldn't shake it; to have pulled oneself back from being so far gone is such a testimony to what the human soul is capable of. The book made me see that being a victim, and victimizing others, is much more complicated than I had thought. It's not always black and white. It is difficult to convey the effect that this book has had on me, but I wholeheartedly recommend it and urge others to read it."
5,"Awesome charactors, awesome plot","I loved the plot in Wind Shifter because it had sort of a surprise ending, or I, at least, didn't expect it. I loved the fantasy setting and all the charactors."
3,Interesting WWII thriller,"At times I wonder if there is a dog eared manual for ""thriller"" authors stipulating that they must write at least one WWII/Nazi caper to earn their wings/stripes. ""The Runner"" is this author's venture into this realm. In a nutshell - and without spoiling the plot - ""The Runner"" chronicles the professional and personal hunt of an SS Nazi war criminal who escapes from Allied detention in post war Germany - literally right after the conclusion of the war. Character development in this book is very good, historical detail is excellent and the ""hook"" devised by the author is realistic enough to make one pause. Unfortunately, for me at least, this book was too long. The detail that makes this book a success is also its downfall - overwhelming the story line and bogging down the reader."
3,Good Story - bad Grammar,"The story itself is good and well written. Unfortunately, my paperback edition was full of typos. Also, someone with better German language skills should have reviewed the grammar and spelling of the German in the book!"
3,Conspiracies Abound,"Now I like a super hero as much as anyone. But I like him to be believable.. I think the character of Devlin Judge moves beyond reality. Much more realistic to me is the character of his foe, the German officer Erich Seyss. This novel is a reasonably good read. But.I think, not compelling."
5,Another winner,"Like his first novel, Numbered Account, Chris Reich has written another fabulous book, this one a sophisticated, smart period piece. I'm waiting for screenplay adaptations (and the movies) for both books."
2,Mediocre,"Reichs' first novel that took place in Switzerland was pretty exciting, but I felt this one was not nearly as exciting. It seemed very jammed with facts and details, lots of research that got in the way of the story. I also didn't believe that the hero who's supposed to prosecute cases at Nuremberg would drop everything to chase an escaped Nazi POW."
4,A first-rate thriller,"This novel is first-rate. Reich spins a captivating tale of a German Olympic runner and a New York detective caught up in a web of intrigue and revenge in the period immediately following the fall of Germanay and the end of the Second World War. Devlin Judge is part of an international tribunal to try Nazi war criminals. He sets out to capture Eric Seyss who has escaped from a POW camp. But Seyss, a former Olympic sprinter, has one last mission to accomplish for the Fatherland. This mission is part of a conspiracy that reaches into the upper echelons of the American army."
3,Just Okay,"The basic premise of The Runner and the description of the post-WWII period in Germany are very interesting. However, Reich's writing style has made his latest suspense thriller somewhat lacking in ""the stuff"" I need to keep me, and I think many readers of this genre need to keep them, on ""the edge of their seat."" For instance, the main character and key supporting characters are not interesting enough, and so I found myself not caring as much as I probably should have about what happens to them. Further, the action sequences were not plentiful enough for my taste and were too spread out when they did occur. As a consequence of these limitations, I found The Runner, overall, to be moderately enjoyable but a book that was easy for me to put down to do other things and not be in a rush to get back to."
3,Will give 3 and 1/2 stars,This is one of those novels where its not really a problem to put the book down and take a break. The writing style is such that it just doesn't grab you and not let you go. It is well researched and brings back some history that I've forgotten involving General Patton and his ideals and opinions. The action-when it occurs-seems abrubt. The details could have been more interspersed with the action to create a more fluid and suspenseful read.
3,Those Crazy Nazis,"I took the time to finish this book, hence three stars. The setting in post WW II Germany seemed well researched and was fascinating. The rest of the plot and characterization was more preposterous than Jason Bourne, and far less exciting and entertaining. The historical twists were somewhat thought provoking. Could an Allied General who fought Nazis be one?"
4,Good reading,Amazed how historicaly and geographically accurate this author is. You would expect that he lived in Germany for years and privately new the main characters met in the novel.
1,"Been there, done that. . . Way too familiar","Not a terrible book, but it's marred by the feeling of familiarity -- it's been done by better writers (Ken Follett, Jack Higgins, others) and seems not just derivative but sort of rote. The author is a workmanlike prose stylist with a tendency to overuse big words; the characters are pretty thin and not so easy to identify with. The author's first book at least had the virtue of a setting (inside a Swiss bank) that we hadn't really seen much of before. This one's OK, but I recommend instead getting a copy of ""Eye of the Needle."""
1,Say no to hate !,"Yet another hate mongering bigot author trying to cash in on the Germanophobia money pit!Say NO to hate, don't buy this book!I know you would never have the guts to print this."
3,Not as good as Numbered Account,Bought this with high hopes after reading Numbered Account. This is not as good as that one was.
3,Stalking The Elusive Nazi War Criminal,"The author writes well and the characters in his novel are well drawn and interesting. The problem I had with this book is that, plot-wise, almost all of it has been done before. The time of the novel is just after the second world war and the action takes place in Germany. The bad guy is a dedicated SS officer who escapes from prison. He plans to assasinate one of the big three (Truman, Churchill, Stalin) in order to shape the political/economic future of Germany. The hero of the piece is an American officer (former policeman/lawyer) whose priest/brother was killed in cold blood by the Nazi. He pursues the bad guy. My interest flagged three-quarters of the way through. Maybe you'll do better."
2,Horrible,"Don't read this book just because you liked Numbered Account. Numbered Account was excellent, this is anything but. I had to force myself to read the last 200 pages. I still don't know where the climax is. Horrible book. I hope he does better next time."
2,"Just the facts, ma'am!","Sorry, this one doesn't do it for me. In order to enjoy fiction, one must be able to ""suspend disbelief"" and be caught up in the story along with the characters. Too many factual errors for me to maintain that critical suspension of disbelief in this one. For example, Mr. Reich describes a .45 caliber pistol as having nine bullets in the cartridge, one in the chamber. Huh? A bullet IS a cartridge, and they go in the magazine, or the clip. Little things like this are jarring, like seeing a soldier with long hair curling over his ears in a movie about WWII - just not realistic. Mr. Reich has a fairly good writing style, but he needs - badly - a fact checker."
2,Good Yarn - Bad Editing,"An interesting story. Mediocre writing style. Terrible editing. Historical facts, geography errors, and anachronisms take away from an otherwise ineteresting plot. This author needs to check his facts, even if his book is fiction. A Nelson DeMille he's not."
4,"A Fun, Well-Crafted Story!","Rita Herron is a master of the descriptive word. Her writing is rich with color and description and her characters are well-developed. Though this story is sexier than I normally read, Ms. Herron does a terrific job of crafting a fun and interesting story."
1,Charlotte,"Very close to porn. In addition, the descriptions and actions were so repetitive that I wasn't compelled to finish reading the book. I just skipped to the back to see if I would be surprised by the ending. I wasn't. Lesson for me - read the negative reviews as well before purchasing."
2,Meh,"I always try to finish books I start and I finished this one even though I didn't care much for it. Maybe it was the genre that caused me to dislike it so much - I'm not into the ""romance novels."" An example? This line: ""He wanted to taste her, to touch her, to revel in the heat that spiked a fever in his body every time he was near her."" Seriously? I think a cute story could've been told without all the references to sex. I'm not opposed to sex, but in today's world, this book takes a male/female relationship a few steps back. If you like reading these kinds of books, go for it. Me - not so much."
1,How Much???,Really? I would never pay that much for any book much less this one. If this is an error please let me know I might be interested if it were $.99.
1,oh DEAR!!!! $99 for this??,"hope this is an error cause the reviews stink and that's just a tad pricey for a kindle book,lol, but free for prime members...."
1,Two Thumbs Down!!,"I got this book as a free Kindle download, which is a good thing, because had I paid money for it, I'd be angry. Now I'm not one who only reads highbrow literature, I like a fun, easy romance as much as the next girl, but this is pure drivel. Poorly written, silly characters and as one reviewer stated, ""close to porn""-let's call it soft porn. I make it a point to finish the books I start, because usually I can find some redeeming quality by the end, but this book is unreadable. Pass this one up."
2,needy and flat,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, Marry Me Maddie, enough to see what was next with these characters. I appreciated the attempt but I found myself only finishing the book because I started it. The characters turned needy and the plot and side stories just became whiny, overly predictable and unrealistic. I suggest sticking with book one and reveling in that happy ever after."
3,"Good story, but...","I liked the story, for the most part. Even though it was fairly predictable and a bit too cliché, I cared about the characters and wanted to know how it would end.However, the book was in great need of some editing, and I did wonder if English was the author's first language. For example, someone was told to quit standing there and get off their duff, characters made love with bated breath and there were several other confusing uses of idioms. The sex scenes were plentiful, but very stilted, awkward and oddly phrased. I found myself skipping through them to read the story (as opposed to some books, where you skip to the sex scenes)."
4,Rich characters in a wonderful story!,"The author hooked me into this story right from the start. Sophie hosted a talk show dating game and her on-going crush with her best friend's brother forced her to sabotage the production by organizing that her friend's brother be chosen as the winner. Except he found out and changed spots with a smarmy, love-sick loser who Sophie was now forced to share the glamorous romantic weekend she had planned with Lance in mind. Imagine everything in her suitcase chosen with the man she loved as her goal to seduce. Imagine Lance, at home, renovating her house and thinking of her lying in the arms of the creep he'd foisted on her. What a fun book! Rita Herron is a wonderful writer and her rich characters will keep you reading till the end."
5,Loved it,"Another great book by this talented author. Quite sexy and romantic, just like I knew it would be. I'm looking forward to the next one."
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!,"I read ""Marry Me Maddie"", my very first book by Rita Herron. I was very happy to learn from readers there was the second book ""Sleepless in Savannah"". This was just as good as the first. Love all the characters. It actually had me laughing out loud in parts. I must say I am looking forward and hoping for the third book. Something good has to happen to Reid now. Give Rita a chance, I am sure you, too, will fall in love with her writing. Very light, fast paced, funny works!!! We all need some fun things in life & Rita Herron provides that in a her writing!!! New, huge fan!!! Given the opportunity, get them both. You will not be sorry, I wasn't, I was pleasantly surprised & enjoyed every minute of both books. Rita please keep them coming!!!"
4,Loved it,"Clever twist on emotional childhood baggage we all carry. Loved that the hero was a but of his ""game"" and had to really think outside the box.."

2,save your money,"the white papers and study tools that come with the book are not available from the syngress website. I have emailed them twice and got no response. i previously purchased the checkpoint ng book and took the ccsa and failed. that book was completely useless. this book isn't as bad, but still too basic. the best study tool is to get a copy of AI from checkpoint and use the 15 day trial as a training / studying tool. don't buy this book."
1,Ronan doesn't have the unique voice,"he should sing baladeand he should go back in BoyzoneStephen Gately has a far more better quality album, but just because of lack of geniune help from record company, didn't let him climb high as Ronan. Ronan can't sing the way Stephen sings. He got all that just because everybody weirdly helped him.Being a fan of Boyzone for 8 years, I can tell who can sing and who can't! Just watch Boyzone's Live performances, you'll get the answer."
2,Un cierto vacío.,"García Márquez escribe muy bien, es un gran profesional... Y quizá sea por eso por lo que algunas de sus obras no acaban de convencerme. Me cuesta trabajo encontrar el sentimiento detrás de su virtuosismo. Prefiero escritores quizá no tan hábiles pero que narran más a flor de piel, como Arlt. Estos cuentos están, sin duda, bien hechos, pero me han dejado indiferente."
3,"Worked for a while, then stopped lighting","that's it. I had the lighter for a few months. I enjoyed the incredibly powerful flame. Now it usually won't light and I have trouble keeping it lit when it does light. It still has 3/4 tank. I've tried adjusting the flame all over (I had not touched this adjustment before the problem).For 8 bucks, I don't feel horribly ripped off, but I'm looking for a different lighter as a replacement."
1,nail polish remover????,"I was very excited to find the Suncoat product line because I'm trying to make my home as green as possible. I have three colors of the nail polish and the nail polish remover. I love the Berry color nail polish but I haven't tried the electric blue yet. When I went to remove the polish from my toes, it took an exceptionally long time to remove. I didn't time the first foot however it was over ten minutes. It took 16 minutes to remove the polish from the other foot!!!!! I don't know about other people but being a mom of two boys, I don't have much time to begin with. This is not acceptable for me. I may have to go back to the chemical kind of remover."
2,Smelly Remover that Works on Water Based Nail Polish,"This remover works with both water based nail polish and regular nail polish. I used it with Suncoat non-peel-off nail polish and it took about 25 minutes to remove the polish from my fingernails. It gets the job done, but I do not like the unpleasant smell. There are other natural nail polish removers that smell better."
1,Scam!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother and had it shipped directly to her house. My mother didn't open it immediatley because she still had some of the Vivid I gave her for her birthday. She was very disappointed to discover the Vivid I purchased from the seller didn't have ANY fragrance. My mother is upset that I spent that kind of money but I am upset the the seller will not replace this defective product. We all know Liz Claiborne no longer makes Vivid perfume so every bottle out there is old, but don't ship someone an inferior product and fall back on some return policy BS.FOR THE RECORD: I didn't ask for a refund - I asked for this seller to make it right by replacing it and they refuse to!Buyers beware of this one!"
3,Not the same as the original,"This was my favorite perfume and I was so disappointed when they stopped making it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered immediately. This perfume is similar, but not quite the original Vivid."
1,Repetitive collection of dated newspaper columns,"I'll try to start with something positive: the cover is pretty.Beyond that, I'm not going to put more time into my review than the author spent ""writing"" this book which means I've got 5 minutes or less. This is a collection of newspaper columns. If the author wrote 10 columns on the same topic and included them all in the book, he didn't even bother to edit out the redundancies. Columns that span 20 pages in the book could have been reduced to 4 by eliminating the 80% of each column that he spent repeating the previous day's columns.Couple that with columns that spend 10-20 pages arguing against a particular injustice, only to see in a 1 paragraph note at the end that the injustice was indeed righted, or that the column is 5 years out of date and no longer relevant with events that have transpired since, and one gets the sense of a writer with little respect for his readers and their time.Done. In under 5 minutes."
1,amazon owes me a refund,"purchased item.... it came with contents missing.... sent item back and amazon sent another package with an item missing, finally requested a full refund and i have still not been given my refund and the website doesnt allow me to correspond with anyone about the problem, also there is no phone number to call anyone in customer service....i just recieved a form letter that states that they could not give me my refund becuase they did not charge me for the second shipment..... of course they did not it was an exchange, idiots... any one else having problems like this please email me.. becuase this is ridiculous if it is not an isolated incidentgransenor@yahoo.com"
2,Too many stories,"I, too, have read all the novels in this series and have been waiting for Sam and Lys's story--and that's what I wanted. But why in the world she threw in the stories about Noah and his grandfather's second wife--well, it made the book endless. Those stories were incredibly boring. We could have learned about Sam's terrible childhood in five pages. I skipped many chapters and the middle of the book, just looking for sections with Sam's name in them.Cut 100 pages and this is a FIVE star."
4,"Not what was expected! But, still a must read story!!","As an answer to the reviewer who did not get what she expected, I share some of her thoughts. The usual suspense, drama and sparks really are not in this book. It almost does not qualify as a romance. But, for Suzanne Brockmann fans and fans of this series, this is a must read book. It does put an end to a lot of story lines. Also, it was very interesting looking in to Sam's background and reading the story of his up bringing.As far as romances goes, it was sort of dull (except for Max and Gina). This book is well worth the money."
5,Well worth waiting for!!!!,"I'd give it a perfect 10 stars if possible. I try to never buy hardcover books because they don't travel well. I was dying to read this book about Sam & Alyssa so I bought it instead of waiting for the paperback. I know some of the reviews have called this not one of her best books but I totally disagree. If you've never read one of her books about SEAL Team Sixteen you may be lost for a while, but as far as I'm concerned you just need to read all of this series and get the thrill of your life. This is one of Suzanne's best series and I'm just sorry it may be over. Come on Suzanne there has to be someone you left out and need to write about in your next book."
1,Too Far Gone,"I'm really struggling with finishing this book. After reading the part about Alyssa's 2 sisters pregnancies, I realized this sounded familiar and checked my list of books read. I checked this one out from the library, didn't go looking for it on purpose. This story is just too much to swallow. Why does an author try to cover EVERY subject in the world with one story? Terrorist, AKA 9/11, spousal and child abuse, porn, inter-racial marriages, red neck stereo type casting, FBI paranoia,etc? Better to pick one theme and stick to it. I hope our countries security and safety is not hinged on these sex obessed people as described in this plot. Help. Did we really swallow the accident Gina had with Max just happening to be there to the rescue? And that the drivers mimiced her cousin that was her father's 4 youngest brother's 3rd youngest son. Give me a break. My last foray into the world as seen by Ms. Brockmann."
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed in this book. I felt the plot was not good and it kept going back and forth. It was hard to follow. I probalby will not read one of hers again. I also did not like the language in it. I don't know why writers feel they have to use bad language to make a book. I was offended.
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Suzanne Brockmann, but this book was not her usual suspense, drama and romance. I agree with readers from Watkinsville and Medina. In the beginning Sam was more worried about getting Alyssa back than his daughter. Also, Sam's character was so super sensitive and so unlike the Sam in the other books that his character wasn't Sam at all, but Ringo. There was very little suspense with Sam and Alyssa in this book, no shockers at all. There wasn't much SEAL action either. The only real action was at the end, which as one reviewer mentioned was tied up as neat as a bow. I have never been able to put any of Brockmann's books down until completely read. However, I had to make myself finish this book because it was so boring. I gave it two stars only because of Max and Gina."
3,Gone Too Far,"As a devoted fan of Suzanne Brockmann, I was very disappointed in Gone Too Far. It was difficult to get past the constant flash backs to Sam's early years. Whilst I like more than one story going on in a book there were just too many in this one. Just as you got into a story you were switched to one of several others. Usually I read her books immediately but found this one difficult to get through...at least Sam and Alyssa are at the heart of the book."
5,The Best One!,I love all of the Troubleshooters books but I think this one is the best by far! I love Sam & Alyssa's story!
2,Worse than 'Into the Night ' - boring,"This book is the closely-tied sequel to 'Into the Night'. I felt it dragged. I skimmed large sections of it just to get through it. I'm happy that Mary Lou survived the storyline although her character development pretty much ended in 'Into the Night'.I was surprised that Alyssa had any warm fuzzies at all for Sam - they must have happened behind the scenes or in the sections I skimmed because in the pages I did read, she was always hateful to him.However, I was happy to get the background story on Max & Gina whose story is a well-done recent release of Ms. Brockmann's."
3,GONE TOO FLAWED,"Yes, we were all looking forward to Sam and Alyssa's story. Yes, this is an excellent series. But in common with many other reviewers, I feel that there are too many story lines going on in GONE TOO FAR. You never can settle back with the book, because it jumps around every few pages. Also, this book keeps going back to previous books in the series. I had trouble remembering who Ms. Brockman was talking about. Maybe it would help to go back and read three or four of the previous books in the series prior to reading this one. In any event, it was hard to get through the book. I usually read a book in one sitting, but this one took me several days. Hopefully, Ms. Brockmann's next one will be an improvement."
2,Too drawn out,"I was very very disappointed in this book, after eagerly awaiting it. It was too long, with too many story lines. It could have been made into a 200 page book. No sizzle and spark like the other books in this series."
4,been there read that,"over all as always, Suzanne has kept my attention. her characters are strong alpha males with a touch of nice added to them, The one thing that bothered me was the character Tom, It was like I read this before, The first thing that popped into my mind as I was reading was that Tom had turned into Morgan Treyhern from Lindsay Mckenna's Morgan mercenaries, It's perseus revisited"
4,Finally,"I actually read this book a longggg time ago. Even before I got my kindle, and to this day I still love it. I might be a little biased considering I am in an interracial marriage, but I am big Brockmann fan so this book does not let me down. The one thing I did not like was the subplot and the backstory. It seemed a little forced and when it wasn't forced, it was just plain boring, but it's very easy to skip over those parts. I waited and waited for Sam and Alyssa to finally get their own book, and while I do miss them being a subplot, they work for me very much now that they are together."
2,Brockmann can do better,"After anticipating the conclusion to the Sam and Alyssa story for the last five Seal Team 16 books, I was sorely disappointed in this book. There were too many story lines introduced that interfered with the flow of the main story. Only about 40 percent of the book were devoted to the main characters, very little of which is spent on romance or even true character building. Ms. Brockmann seems to have been more concerned with setting up her newest story line (a civilian, covert agency) than giving her readers what they have been expecting. The ending or HEA for these two characters was very rushed and not supported by the action in this book. After her dismal efforts in Into the Night, this is a second strike for Brockmann."
4,Loved it!,"Lot's of action, romance and fun. Suzanne Brockmann really come through with her Troubleshooters series, my daughter and I loved it."
3,"Good Bearings, Over-Priced","I think these are good bearings and probably well-made, but I feel they are way over-priced.Guess that's the cost of dealing with the Swiss."
1,A rare Taunton miss...,"The title is misleading. Interior painting is barely touched upon, exterior painting content is basic at best. Staining and finishing sections are rather rudimentary.Typos abound. Some sidebars are repeated three times.I've never been disappointed by a Taunton book until this one."
4,A nice little book for improving your pictures.,"This little paperback book provides a good introduction not only to the Advanced Photo System (APS), but also to general photography technique. It helps you to learn about your APS camera and to make decisions on how and when to use the various photo modes and sizes. It also talks about composing your photographs to obtain the best shot possible, and it covers specific issues such as indoor versus outdoor photography, holiday and vacation shots, children, etc. This would be a great book for anyone beginning to have a serious interest in taking pictures, and it would be appropriate for an older child/teenager."
4,A decent beginner's book,"This book is perfect for the beginner. It briefly explains what APS is, how it differs from 35mm. Then the book descibes the basics of photo composition: rule of thirds, flash vs. natural light, shadows, etc. Plus it also suggest how/when to use C/H/P settings on the APS when composing your shot."
1,Pots,"This pot is worthless, the coating inside wore off in such a short time, it is made too cheaply."
1,Difficult to follow!,I am in a class at Community College of Baltimore County and we are using this book at this time. Our whole class along with the Professor find this book to be very difficult to follow. The book constantly repeats itself making it extremely boring to read and is not fluent at all. They have examples that reference charts that are 3-5 pages apart from the problem being discussed the formulas you almost have to figure out for yourself how they are used and there are alot of typos.I recomend burning this book!!!!!!!
4,A good guide from start to finish,"As a general civil engineer in private practice this book has provided a good overview on the more abstract side of land development including financing, rezoning, and public involvement. All of which, are topics that typical engineers strugle with as it is not the enjoyable aspect of what engineers are trained to do. Nevertheless, these abstract components are just as real as the plans we develop. Of course, the book is excellent for hands on design and calculation support."
5,Another must have for the civil engineer's library,"Buy this book if you are a general civil engineer, even if you do not practice land development, it includes a vast swath of useful information on a variety of projects and topics."
1,Misleading Track/Artist Listing,"Beware - the Amazon track listing lists the song writers, not the artists. For instance 'Isn't She Lovely' lists Stevie Wonder but on the CD the song is sung by Livingston Taylor - not a bad rendition but not what I was expecting.This is a Chesky label compilation (sp?) CD. Title should be ""World's Greatist Audophile Vocal Recordings On Our Label""I should return the CD but don't feel like going to the trouble."
5,One of the best,I so much regret the stupid war sacd vs. dvd-audio. Both formats were good choices.I enjoy a lot lestening multichanel music and this CD is great!!
2,uninspiring performances,"There is not much doubt about the high quality recordings on this disc, but surely we need more than that. Most of the featured artists left me cold and unimpressed. There are far better SACD options out there. A wasted opportunity."
2,Chesky chesty,I have yet to hear a recording of any musical substance from Chesky and would never spend another penny on anything with Ana Caram which has to be one of the least talented singer from Brazil needing hormone injections or something to put some energy into her anemic delivery.
4,Not what I expected,"Yes, this is an SACD but it is only two channel and it has no base track (Sub Woofer). Other than that, the sound is fantastic."
3,Flat line,"I have only heard the samples and opted not to buy. I'm sure the sound quality is audiophile quality, but I can't get past the ""FLAT SINGERS'. It must be fashionable in this day and age to sing flat or to consistently force notes flat. The GREATEST of entertainers made a fortune doing that (setting a trend?), and it drives me nuts! I don't want to offend any one's favorites, and if you don't notice or don't care, then more power to you, but I personally feel that one's voice is his/her instrument and it should be in tune regardless of how much money you make or who doesn't take notice! If I only cared about the content and not quality, I would listen to the Muppets sing Sinatra. I'm sorry, but I don't apologize for my convictions, these are professionals who should know better, and who have at their disposal the marvel of electronic pitch correction. It's like jazz-crooner grunge. Don't you hear it? I won't listen to it!"
3,My Purchase,The product took too long to ship out. I could have purchased it from another seller and receiving it much faster (only 2 USD more expensive)
2,Technology Lacking,"Disappointed with the function of this product. With today's technology, I expected a lot more. The manufacturer claimed a greter capability. It identifies colors, but not alwys with accuracy. For example, pink is identified as red. On the positive side, I learned the placemats on my table are black/olive green. I think that is right! Being completely colorblind, I rely on my color-sighted friends for accurate information. In a pinch, the device will be useful; although, it is almost too large to carry in my purse."
5,The reason for all the 5 star reviews,"This game deserves all of the 5 star reviews. The concept is simple, the execution is nearly flawless, the possibilities are endless.Each player's task is to work their way around the board to find treasures. The only problem is, the paths around the board shift on every move. You might be one space from your treasure at the end of your turn, then find yourself on the other side of the board on the next turn. Conversely, there is often a path from one corner of the board to the diagonal opposite corner for a clever player to discover.With three or more players, cooperation comes into play. ""I'll help you if you help me,"" becomes a strategy to beat another player who has gotten ahead. This can get very interesting, as players can use their move to block other players instead of getting themselves closer to their goal.Overall, a family winner."
5,amazeing,I bought this game for my neighbors kids after playing it with my 11 year old nephew. Ravensburger products are always awesome. Even my 17 year old son enjoyed it!
5,one of the best,"Ravensburger puts out great games! We have played the aMAXEing Labyrinth for years and it's always fun and fresh. Just bought another copy for a friend. We use it at school when we play learning games as well. Family and friends from age 4 to 74 have played it; especially enjoyed by middle schoolers, believe it or not. Put away those video games for a while and try this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,Good game,I bought this for my 7 year old son. We've played sereral times since he's gotten it. It is a challenge for both of us. I love it because it's not an easy mindless game. It's a fantastic change from xbox 360!!
5,grandmom,"I bought this game years ago for my children and we loved it when they were little. We all remembered the name recently and I ordered it again. This game is fun for all ages. You have a piece that changes the path in a maze in order to help you get to a certain spot. Sometimes when you change it for yourself, it changes the path for an opponent and they are unable to get to their location. I was so happy to see that this game was still available. This company has some amazing, creative, and enjoyable games and how nice that we can all play."
5,SO much better than Candyland!,"I have been playing this with my 4 year old for a year. We modify the rules, and it is SO FUN! I even like it! It's not totally repetitive and boring, instead it's fun every time and even holds my attention! BUY THIS GAME! You won't be sorry!"
4,Great for maze enthusiaists,"rules easy to learn, somewhat difficult to visualize new paths, have played many times. good, but not great game"
2,Its really a boring game . . . .,"I bought this game for nephew who is eight. It has a lot of pieces and a lot of colors, which makes it fun for a kid. The game is really kind of boring and the labrynth tiles are hard to slide."
5,Awesome,The most awesome game for kids and adults alike - teaches kids to think out of the box. Probably okay for kids 8 years + til 99!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If this is a gift for a child, it's OK at best. If you're truly interested in learning the art, do some research and spend a little more. The brushes and ink stick were cheap and the ink stone isn't the right shape inside the bowl, so ink cannot be made properly.Check out: Takase Shodokai (Learn Japanese Calligraphy) for both the proper How-To, and the correct tools you will need."
2,Not what I paid for,"I ordered this for a calligraphy class and chose this particular one because the stones looked especially nice with the design at the top. When it came in the mail the ink plate was broken along with the plastic tips of the brushes. Also, the seal stones were about half of the size represented in the picture and did not have any detailing on them at all. Another issue I had was that I paid expedited shipping and it took about a week to get to me even though they did not ship it from all that far away from where I live. It was a major disappointment and I can't use half the stuff since its either broken or too small for what we're doing in class."
2,Disappointing,"We bought this set as a gift for our teenage daughter. We were very disappointed with the quality of the brushes, which broke immediately. The cover of small pot of red ink for the stamp had bonded to the base and we had to work with hot water and a blade to open it. The stamp is uncarved and there is no practical way to carve it unless you already own sculpting tools. The parts we did like include the pretty case, bar of black ink, and brush rest."
1,Not the actual book!,"I ordered what I thought was the book, but received an audio CD instead. I can't take the CDs to class."
5,Very Elegant,These flutes sold for twice as much in the upscale stores. I was very pleased and they do come with a lifetime replacement certificate.
1,A disappointing read,"I don't usually write book reviews; however, in the case of ""ANATOMY of the CHOPPER"" I'll make an exception. This book is a glorified advertisement for about two dozen custom chopper builders and even more manufactures of motorcycle parts - truly a disappointing read. ""ANATOMY of the CHOPPER"" is filled with ""one-off"" non EPA compliant custom builds that can only be ridden into the trailer on show day. And shame on you Doug Mitchel for letting Exile Cycles' ""Brown Pearl"" into this book; rusting tin may have its place in the art world, but that bike clinched a spot for ""ANATOMY of the CHOPPER"" in the ""worst chopper books"" hall of fame... nice going Doug. And to everyone thinking about buying this book - if you're looking to expand your knowledge on chopper design, construction, or dynamics - buy something else; although, if you like looking at show-chrome and cool chopper pictures this book is for you."
2,poor video quality,"This female s-video to male RCA converter does work, but the video produced is jittery and pretty grainy on a 47"" LCD tv. Also, some horizontal sections of the screen randomly shifted sideways. I ended up getting a new cable."
1,Buyer beware,I purchased 8 of these converters and 4 of them worked. Very disappointed in the lack of quality control. They must not test these out at all. Would not recommend.
1,Didn't work for me,"This converter did not work for me. I originally wanted to use it to connect my S-vid output on my media computer through my Pioneer A/V box which only had RCA plugs. All i got was a bunch of diagonal lines on the TV.Tried connecting directly to the TV's RCA video input and got the same diagonal lines. Svideo from the computer to the S-vid input on the TV worked fine, so it looks like this converter doesn't work. It came from Hong Kong and took three weeks to get here. oh well"
5,great for the job....,"If this little converter is what's needed for your application, it'd does the job completely. Coming off a LONG s-video cable run from a Directv HD receiver with the HDMI being already used and not wanting the extra cost of a HDMI amplifier or re-running that long of a HDMI cable for this application it was perfect. Of course the picture quality is downgraded form a HDMI signal but on a smaller screen or just for a lesser cost use it is great. And can you beat the $$$$ ??"
3,Its ok,Didn't give me the video quality I was expecting but it did work. I did end up purchasing a different adapter that had better reviews and cost a little more money. I wouldn't but the Dayton converter again.
5,Does what it says,There is not much to review. This product does what it is intended to do. Easy to set up and use.
4,Works well for us,"I am not sure why this doesn't work for other people because it works for us and I'm back to buy another one. Yes, If my kids go wild and pull, pull, pull, pull like crazy they can get it open, but it takes them a lot of pulls, which lets me know that they are trying to get in the oven and I can stop them. I have 5 kids and I wouldn't be without it. I have never had any trouble with it sticking. Maybe my husband used some magic glue, but it has worked fine over here. When we really want to keep them out of the kitchen we use a gate, but mostly this lock deters my kids fine. And for reference I have a 7 year old, 4 year old, and 18 month old triplets."
1,not worth it,My son is obsessed with the oven. hurried up and ordered some sort of locking mechanism. got this. he was only about 10 months at the time and he ripped the thing off. waste of money.
5,The best book I have read on developing personal leadership.,David Neidert's book is the best book I've read on developing personal leadership. From the quotes to the content this book will provide you with the the stimulus to engage in real learning through reflection. The organization of leadership into the four seasons is easy to understand and follow. A must if you are serious abour personal leadership development.
3,Perfectly adequate,"Having read _Real Freedom for All_, in which the author outlines his UBI proposal in detail, I purchased this volume in the hope of finding insightful commentary and sound criticism. Much to my chagrin, I was disappointed. While Edmund Phelps and Emma Rothschild had insightful essays, I didn't find very much in the way of dissent. Phelps certainly did disagree, but many of the others were just wailing like nettlesome grandmothers while conceding Van Parijs' point. Galston's essay left much to be desired, predictably enough. Couldn't they have asked a thoughtful critique on the Right? But again, this is certainly not awful. My favorite Boston Review forum remains Martha Nussbaum's _For Love of Country_, which did have a broad range of dissenting voices and is definitely worth checking out. If you are strictly interested in UBI or distributive justice, turn to _RFA_."
1,Agree it always falls apart,The two peices always fall apart. I have found that the safety 1st AC cord mender works better for blinds.
1,Worse than useless: a false sense of security,"These appear at first to work just fine. But, when my son reached the end of the cord and pulled it, the wind-up popped off, and the cord unspooled instantly.Don't trust your baby's safety to these."
1,Great idea but didn't work for me,These are a great idea but didn't work for me. Our cords are thick and long and wouldn't fit inside the box.
2,Better to just shorten the cords.,This works but it is just a container to hold the cords. It does not wind and unwind without opening. We ended up just cutting our cords to shorten them.
1,try something else,"I bought these for my plantation blinds. If you have lightweight venetian blinds with very short cords, this might be useful. I can not wind up enough cord to shorten it enough to keep out of reach. And if I do get it short enough, then when I try to actually open the blinds this thing pops off. they are hard to keep on. Also, if they are within reach of the child, they create a strangulation hazard because they create a loop. I am going to replace these with cleats next to my windows."
1,Frusterating!,I am a short mother of active twins. I purchased these in hopes that it would save my blinds from being yanked down. Sadly after the first couple times of using them I realized they were not going to be any help at all. Any time I try to pull the blinds up or put them back down the cord winder pops apart and the two pieces go flying in opposite directions. I can hold onto them till a certain point but then I am to short to do it the rest of the way. Everytime I use them they come apart. Putting the cords in a loose knot is less work and quicker! I can't even get one winds cords to wind up enough for my two 15 month olds not to get ahold of it. It was a great concept but they just didn't pull it off. They need a much better way of locking the two pieces together for them to be even slightly useful.
3,like it... but dont love it,"these do get the job done.... if you have really long cords they still hang down pretty low, but they still are high enough to keep out of my son's reach. before i just had a nail up on the wall and had the string up on it, and that did the trick too, but this is a bit easier. (my son is 15 months) I for the life of me could not figure out how to put the dang thing together. the package instructions didnt make sense to me, and i even looked up instructions online. maybe i'm just blonde, i dont know. I was just horribly confused. i ended up just doing what i thought looked right, and it worked out, but i'm not sure if it's the ""correct"" way. it was very inexpensive and it got the job done, so overall i'm pretty happy with it. just wish it went up higher. I guess for the money, I would recommend it."
5,Good book to read in bed,Title says it all. Well written and follows the TV show and a nice way to relax on a rainy day.
4,Murder She Wrote: Dying to Retire,I happen to enjoy this book very much. It just so happened that I was in Florida at the time I read this book. What a coincidence.
3,Doesn't fit the Magellan Meridian in Car Bracket,"Though Amazon offers this item at a discount with the Meridian GPS, it is the wrong model. It is designed for the GPS 315/320 and does not fit the Meridian when mounted in the Meridian Vehicle Mounting Bracket. The correct one (I presume) is labelled ""Magellan Meridian PC Data Cable with Cigarette Lighter Adapter"", part number 730345."
4,Protect the Pins,I love using this cable with a laptop and a street atlas program to know exactly where I am and how far it is to the next turn. But be careful with the cable when not connected to the GPS. I bent a pin while pulling it out of my backpack and it eventually broke off. I had to buy a new one. I'm now making a cover to protect the pins during storage.
3,"a horrible, but completely necessary cable","this cable sucks but it's all you've got.it's a pain to attach (you have to press it against the back of the receiver while trying to screw it on) and it's a serial cable. gawd forbid, you don't have a serial port.HOWEVER, without it, you can't attach your Magellan GPS to your computer. and if you can't do that, you're missing out on the best parts of the receiver. manage your waypoints, create routes, upload topo or street maps ... there's a world of stuff you can do only with your PC.as for the serial connection, well, there are serial to USB adapters. they aren't always easy to configure but with a little work you can make it happen."
3,Celebration,"Out'a Nowhere is the 1st and best song on here! Stay Strong & Together are next. In fact, the 1st 4 tracks and last two are the best . The album started to slip for me somewhere in the middle. I guess because I didn't like the vocals. But an overall good album, especially if you Cd burned this like I DID. (hehehe)"
5,Norman Brown -Celebration,"Love this CD! I bought it for the song ""Paradise"" but it is one sweet CD. Great songs, he is a great guitar player, and he is from my home town! A MUST for any jazz lover or music lovers who enjoy a great guitar player. Thank you!"
5,Another Great CD By Norman!!,"Well I wasn't disappointed when buying this laest CD by guitarist Norman Brown.It is the usual mix of contemporary jazz with vocals added on the remakes of R&B songs you know.The best rendition comes with the final track, 'Rain'.(NOTE-This song was added on later editions of this CD, and all previous discs only have the instrumental version.) The new vocal version includes a great performance by Vesta, who makes you forget about the original song by SWV.Vesta 'puts it down' here, and the vocal version of 'Rain' is worth the price of the entire CD.Great music from start to finish!!"
5,SWEET & MELLOW,"I HERAD HIS NAME A LOT, BUT NEVER REALLY PAID ATTENTION UNTIL NOW... I MUST ADMIT I'M IN LOVE. MR. NORMAN BROWN CAN PULL UP A CHAIR AND PLAY FOR ME ANYTIME. IF YOU LOVE JAZZ WITH A TOUCH OF R&B PLEASE GET THIS CD...IT FLOWS SO SWEET AND MELLOW. MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE CD ARE...PARADISE, YOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW, AND THE RAIN REMIX WITH R&B SINGER VESTA. I CAN'T EXPRESS ANY FUTHER HOW GOOD THIS CD IS. BUT LETS SAY YOU NEEDED TO RELAX BY THE FIREPLACE, WITH SOME CANDLES,AND A NICE LITTLE DINNER WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL...THIS CD WILL COMPLIMENT YOUR SETTING LIKE A SWEET TASTING DESSERT. SO ENJOY."
1,Good news! Finally: a Black Kenny G!,"Scientists who have been working to find a frictionless surface need look no further: Norman Brown is it. This guy is smooth. So smooth he might just slide off of your ears. I tried but I could not detect any soul at all. So let's call Norman a Black Kenny G. Seriously, though, folks: if you want silky smooth soul music, buy some Marvin Gaye, okay?"
3,Second best Brown offering to date,"Brown hasn't hit the fine middle ground between too-commercial and tradition that he nailed almost dead-on on his earlier ""After The Storm"", but this record is a pretyty decent smooth jazz record all around, considering the genre's filled with Janet Jackson covers right now. His playing is fine even if all of the actual songs don't quite ring true, but he gives us some things to notice, for sure. And his cover of SWV's ""Rain"" actually soars. Go figure."
1,Agony of the feet!,"I bought these because they look almost identical to my beloved Gizehs. They turned out to be far less flexible, and the thongs injured my middle toes so badly after very brief and painful wearing that I could not wear any shoes at all for the several days it took my feet to heal. Don't be misled by their visual similarity to Gizehs."
5,Betula thong,This thong feels great....Make sure you order your correct size...I went one size up...perfect fit
3,Be aware,"I admittedly bought this one thinking it was an actual Birkenstock, only to realize that it is 'Licenced by Birkenstock'. I must say there is a big difference in the feel and comfort of the 'real thing' to this one. Also I am a US 7.5m and therefore bought the 38 since with Birkenstock you have to go up a size or so to ensure your foot fits properly, however this item was at least an entire size too big and impossible for me to wear. For the price it is a good looking product the straps were very nice and I would have kept the product anyway except for the size. Luckily I found someone to take it off my hands.If you like the look (which I do) and don't mind that the sole is not as soft and comfortable as a Birkenstock then this is an option for you.Hope this helps someone."
4,Betula Sandals,"I bought these sandals because I was looking for something reasonably nice-looking, yet comfortable enough to walk long distances. It was a good choice on both counts. They are sturdy and provide a good amount of support. While I would not wear them to a formal event, I believe these sandals do not look shabby in any way. As with all Birkenstock brand sandals, be advised to not wear them for long distances at first. Give them a chance to become broken in by wearing them for short trips, so they can form to your feet without causing blisters."
4,great shoes,Order from this company only if you have a narrow foot! Great for people with narrow feet and great prices!! I love these shoes. I wear these betulas all the time.
4,Betula sandals,"THe shoe is exactly what I expected, the fit is fine, and the delivery time was quite good. OVerall, this shopping experience was a joy."
5,The Art of Transparency,"This is a beautiful book of wonderful pieces of art which are all done with transparent collage images. The reason I got this book was because I love to work with this medium. They have that see-thru quality that resonates into a different look at art.So much of the art work in this book is so easy to do, I was amazed. The directions are clear and concise and even a novice can do some of these projects. Working with varied mediums such as glass, wood and fabric made the transparent images look different and new.I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't tried their hand at working with transparencies in their collages or altered art. They will be surprised at how this medium will enhance their art."
5,Of significant merit to the literature of mountaineering,"""Alone on the Summit"" is, admittedly, about the ""hard men"" of mountaineering. Some would say that Venables and company are fools for even trying what they succeeded in pulling off: a route up the Kangshung face on the Tibetan side of Everest without oxygen and limited Sherpa support. The book is very well written (why does it seem that the British mountaineers are the only folks with a sense of humour?), and engaging, with spectacular photos. Many people also argue that Venables is particularly prone to having to be rescued, but if you read closely, who among the best mountaineers hasn't been rescued or helped off base camp at one time or another?"
1,HORRID,"I'm a huge MJ fan, but this DVD is a COMPLETE waste of $$$. It's full of commentries, hardly any shots of MJ himself. BORING too."
1,a remarkable flop,This DVD contains none of Michael Jackson's music. It is full of interviews with people that dont know Michael & people that have never worked with Michael.The DVD is full of info that everybody has heard a thousand times so dont expect to be blown away with any new sensational claims.High point would be a portion (very short portion) of a teenage Michael being interviewed. This DVD is cheap and you get what you pay for!
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!,"Do not buy both ""Michael Jackson, A Remarkable Life"" and ""Michael Jackson, Never Surrender."" Though they are packaged and named differently, the CDs are exact copies of each other. The publishers are obviously trying to double their money. I got taken, but don't you do it!"
1,Do Not Waste Your money,"This was one of the most poorly generic pieces of trash that was ever thrown together for money. I am sorry i ever wasted my money. I ususally want Michael Jackson stories to last forever, but I couldn't wait for this one to end. I will never buy something before reviews of it are posted. A complete RIPOFF :("
1,HORRIBLE!,Please save your money! This DVD is cheaply put together and is just utterly awful! It is filled with cheesy background music (none of Michael's music is present) and it is very unprofessional. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your hard-earned money on this wretched documentary!
2,not interesting,This is about people from back in the 70's talking about Michael and J5. Really strange that they were not allowed to play any mj music.... boring
5,Perfect choice for a prayer group Book and Bible Study,"with Prayer and listening for God's voice, our 5 woman strong prayer group chose this book to read for Advent. We've only started but are finding it just what we were looking for. A book to help us connect stronger to worshiping God and Jesus. The writing is filled with humor and is a pleasure to read. It was the right choice for our group!"
5,Best Devotional Commentary on a Popular Passage,"I've read a lot of commentaries over the years that deal with the Martha and Mary passage in Luke 10:38-42. None of them enable the reader to apply the truths there as this book does. While this title is directed primarily toward women, men can learn much from it as well. What Joanna Weaver does here is to promote a balance between the productive Martha and the pensive Mary. She describes the value of both, although acknowledging that most of today's women have far more problems with the Mary side of the equation than with the Martha side. This book would make a great women's Bible study -- in fact, several ladies in my church are using it for that very purpose. This title is excellent -- I recommend it highly!"
4,Good stuff...,"This book is full of good, solid Bibical truths and hits on many different topics that I think most women can relate to. It definitely gives practical and godly advice at how to find intimacy with God in everyday life. While the book probably has a target audience for women older than myself (after college and probably women who are married and have children), it still has spoken to me. I would recommend this book to other women as it is practical and an interesting read. Joanna Weaver relates effectively to the audience and her voice is not a didactic or preachy. I think she speaks from a heart that realizes the importance of seeking an intimate relationship with God. If it is the cry of your heart to have a more intimate relationship with God in this busy world I would encourage you to give this book a shot. Its practical and enjoyable."
4,Easy to apply to your life!,"This book has opened my eyes to how many difficulties I ""think"" I have in my life, but never rely on God to solve them! It redirects you to come back on the path of the Lord and by quoting scripture you can really see how God's word can apply direcly to your life.I am also sharing this book with a group of God-driven women, which really helps to apply the book even further. I highly suggest this easy read!"
3,Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World,"Product was as described. Took a very, very long time to arrive. I ordered July 6, they shipped July 28 and I received July 30. I was afraid I would not receive the item, but it did finally come through."
1,Having a mary Heart in a Martha World,"Our women's covenant group at a local Methodist church worked with this book for a few months. We found the author's viewpoint to be disappointingly demeaning to women: a very fundamentalist portrayal of women based on their Biblical status vs. contemporary society,and assumptions that we cannot prioritize our lives and work to make room for a relationship with God. The writing style was rather awkward, too: many little personal stories with ""forced"" linkages with spiritual messages. The last chapter revealed a probable reason for our frustration: the author states she wrote this book at the age of 37 -- too young to have developed mature coping strategies. We would not recommend the book, due to the biases noted above."
5,"Wonderful, practical book!","We are currently studying this book and even after only studying 2 chapters, we all agree it is a life-changing book!"
4,Excellent Bible Study Book,The girls in my Bible study have really enjoyed reading and studying this book. There is a fantastic study guide at the end of the book that we have used for discussion purposes during our sessions.
5,A Must Have !,"I absolutely love this book and the illustrations provided in it as well. This book has helped me grow and mature in God. If you are a worrier, someone who've been discouraged, in need of a breakthrough this is for you. Even if those things don't apply to you it's something I recommend, b/c I'm not a worrier but this has helped me tremendously. Two thumbs up to Joanna Weaver she's an amazing author."
3,Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World,"This was a good enough book with study guide. It was redundant in numerous chapters and restated the obvious in different ways. It was exceptionally nice of the younger women in my study group to be able to relate to it. However, it really didn't speak to women who are older and have different issues which they encounter on a daily basis. All they could do was agree, as they had ""been there, done that and gotten the tee-shirt"" so to speak. Still, they enjoyed the book to a certain degree. Interest was lost before it was finished and two ladies did not return as a result.We are having another book and Bible Study group in the spring. We will be looking for other books to discuss and even though I've bought and read the follow-up to this one, it will not be used this time.My compliments to the Pastor's wife. Joanna Weaver writes well but speaks to only a certain age group, according to the findings of our group."
4,One of the best guided studies for women,"I did this with my singles group a few years ago, and I've found it helpful again and again. I recommend it, as it is highly convicting and thorough. If you're already know you're a busy Martha type like me, or a quiet Mary type, you'll find this study useful and engaging."
5,Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World. Wonderful book.,Excellent material for a Bible Study. We are all enjoying this book very much. It is giving us so much insight and food for thought. I am glad we chose this book.
5,Great look at the Mary/Martha story,"this gave me a new perspective in an old story. Each element of the story is discussed and the book can be used for a discussion group/bible study. I direct a ""Women of Faith"" discussion group and we spent several sessions discussing Mary and Martha. I used some questions and ideas from the book for discussion. It also is an excellent read for a single reader."
5,Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World,Our small group is doing a study on this book at this time. Everyone feels that we are growing as Christian women.....being able to relate to women in the bible gives us all a different perspective on our lives. A great book!Dorothy Peters
4,Wonderfully informative...,"Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World by Joanna Weaver is a wonderful exploration of two prominent women in the bible. I love how Ms. Weaver relates it relative to our lives today. As a Martha type striving to be more like Mary it was totally relatable and relevant. I loved the way Ms.Weaver revealed her own struggles with Marthalike tendencies.I recommend this book to any woman who is struggling with the busyness of life and would love to slow down and appreciate like Mary. Wonderful spiritual blessing, Ms. Weaver."
3,Can't refill expired or unusable items in the Kit.,"This Kit does have everything one may need to provide emergency first aid. The problem is when such items as the Extra Strength Tylenol, Motrin and St. Joseph Aspirin packets expire, there is no where to purchase them for replenshiment, including from the Kits Manufacturer Johnson and Johnson (J&J). The moist towlettes used to clean wounds eventually dry up and also can't be replaced. It would appear J&J would prefer you buy a new kit, even though the other items are perfectly good. Yes the items are sold separently in bigger sizes at stores and online, but they may not fit well in the kit. Besides, by the time you pay for all of them , it may pay to buy a new kit. Another engineered Corporate ploy to take more money from the consumer."
2,Overpriced,"I bougth this at Walmart for $9.90 and it is overpriced even at that price. The products in the pack are el-cheepo stuff, better to go buy individual and get what you want.."
4,Round Loom Knitting Visual Instruction,"For those of you for which the book instruction is not enough. This is a GREAT instructional dvd. This is a wonderful way to learn to knit on a round loom. You can stop, start, and slow down the dvd. The pace was slow enough for you to follow along, but not too slow. The speech was clear and concise. You learn at YOUR own pace. Repeat something as many times as you need to get it right. No pressure! It was great! When I completed my first project, I was so proud! This is a great dvd and a wonderfully pleasant way to learn. I would also like to highly recommend the Knitting with Needles dvd by the same company. [...] has a sample clip of a lesson."
2,50/50 review on this Knitting Loom DVD,"I learned how to knit on the loom from excellent videos from everyday people on youtube.com. I got this dvd to learn NEW things. From other reviews it sounded like a goldmine of information, it wasn't. This video will NOT teach you the knit stitch or the purl stitch. It will NOT show you how to increase or decrease. Her idea of a ""decrease"" is not knitting the end pegs. The ONLY stitch used is the knit-over. That gives you stockinette stitch. That is all she knits on this video. Video shows how to knit a basic hat, scarf, a slipper and a sock. If you really want to knit a loom sock or slipper then buy it. You can find everything but those 2 on youtube.com"
5,Looming DVD,It showed me how to do something i did years ago and had forgotten how to do it.It showed me how to do it in very easy to understand directions.For anyonyone interested in looming i would suggest this DVD.
4,great product,"Great for storing DVDs in their cases -- 21 fit perfectly. Extremely durable and very well made. I also like that they are stackable, although when they are filled with DVDs, they don't stack properly. They bottom is design to ""nest"" into the top of the one below, but the DVD come up slightly past the top preventing them from nesting. This is not a problem for me since I just have them on shelves next to one another in my entertainment center."
1,Way too small to store anything in the freezer,"5-Inch by 0-1/2-Inch by 8-3/4-InchWay too small to store anything in the freezer.What were they thinking, huh?Maybe I'm missing something."
3,Jesse James: The Man and the Myth,"Apparently, Hollywood paid Brant to do research for a movie on the Younger Brothers. Without a doubt, the research overlapped to the James brothers. For the first of the book, she does a fare job of exposing the myths & must have tired because she took the last quarter to reiterate the dime store versions of history.I question not so much of what was written, conversely what was left out of the book that would eliminate the absolutes is disturbing."
4,Perfect case,I order this case for my grad filters and it works perfectly. Only wish there was a little tab I could write on to show which filter is in which slot. Otherwise it's perfect!
5,I can't imagine anyone playing these pieces better.,"""Clara Park, who makes her recording debut with this disc, is a fastidious, lyrical player who combines delicacy with an ear for detail and matters of structural significance. I can't imagine anyone playing these bon-bons better, or with greater elegance and dedication...Splendidly realized."" -American Record Guide (November/December 1997 issue)"
3,mortise lock sets,I purchased several of the mortise locksets for a remodel. For the price they were pretty nice looking but had problems installing a couple of them and one did not work at all when locking and unlocking it so couldn't use it . All in all for the price they were okay but not sure I would buy again or recommend them.
4,An excellent source for alien information,"This book provides a brief history, typical personality description, and a physical description for each race. You will also find a brief description of the alien's home world as well as all the information necessary to play the race as a character or NPC. There is art accompanying each race however, this artwork is the main reason that I cannot give it 5 stars. While the quality is good, in a few cases it is obvious that the artist did not read the physical description of the species."
5,Great Reference Tool,"Best reference for family games! My family used it to clarify rules regarding Double-Pack Pinochle. It came in handy for my team to win a game because scoring was in dispute, such as, how much does a quadruple Pinochle count?Great book."
2,"Decent book, Low readability.","The amount of information actually obtained on the subject is very little. 1% background, 10% account of the killing incident, 89% of the court case. Pretty boring. The readability of the book is not very good. I think I would actually rather read the original source documents then read this book."
3,this is what I didn't write in my essay for the book for HIS103,"I feel that the story of Celia is better than the book. I say that because the book can be very vague and too narrow at the same time. The author will go on and on (for pages at a time) about an irrelevant political issue in great detail and frequently makes statements like, ""it is possible that..."" and ""it is unknown what happened..."" about Celia's story. To me, it felt like the author was trying to fill the holes left by Celia's lack of historical evidence with other, well-documented events of the time period. I understand some background information is important but that was too much and it happened too often. Despite some of the issues with the book, the story itself is great. I was completely sympathic to Celia and wished that things turned out differently."
1,Classic,"I don't often give book reviews, but when I do... I review terrible books that I had to read once."
4,Fun little device,"It is fun, but little. The speaker volume is not as great as I would have liked, but works."
4,Good sound for the size,"I bought this for my husbands birthday, and he was very impressed with the sound from such a small machine. He just wanted something to listen to his music around the house and this did the trick. We both were happy with this, the price you cannot beat. At Christmas I bought my son a $75 speakers, and it already does not work and did not sound as good as this."
3,Good for price but no volume control!,Good speaker for the price and great that it comes with car charger but it does not have any volume control and it's not as compact (flat) as I thought it would be. Overall it's still a decent speaker for the price.
4,Great Little Speakers,Excellent little speakers for my I-pod. Good sound for their size. Perfect for taking to work to use on my desk. Quick service from seller.
1,isound speakers,"buy something else. The wall plug didn't work, using it with batteries the sound is poor quality"
2,i.sound station speakers,"I found this product to be ok, the only thing i didn't like was there was barely any bass to it and that was what i was looking for."
1,Awful Product,The i.Sound Audio Staion Speakers were awful. The unit was all plastic and very cheap looking and feeling. And the sound quality was terrible. Lots of static and very crackly. I returned this product nearly a month ago and STILL have not received a refund from the seller. Won't purchase from them again!
5,Can't Live Without It,"I was told by a fellow mom that these pads were the only way to go, and I have to say that after 7 months of breast feeding, SHE WAS RIGHT.The local store where I live soled Curity until about 3 months ago. Because of this change I have to order the pads well in advance. On the few occasions that I have run out I have been forced to try other brands. I can tell you that the moisture lock in the Curity brand is the best. How do I know this...I have broken out on several occasions due to the other brands leaving the milk trapped at the surface of the pad.I reccomend this product to everyone I know and thank the fellow mom often."
2,uncomfortable,"I've used the Curity nursing pads because they are the cheapest, but after trying out some others I'd rather pay the higher price. These pads are uncomfortable and lumpy under clothing. I've switched to the Gerber Heavy Flow for nighttime and Johnson and Johnson nursing pads for daytime. These are much smoother, less itchy, and more attractive under clothing."
1,Where's My Leisure Suit?,"There's a reason this is Homer Simpson's favorite ""band"". This is absolutely the most mediocre group of the 70's. This stuff makes Helen Reddy sound exciting. I put part of it on my iPod to play as a joke at parties. Not recommended for people who like music."
4,Nice starter set,"Like the previous reviewer said, the chips themselves are pretty nice looking. They feel solid, and are heavier than other chips I've used. They don't feel like they're gonna fall over when you stack them.Yes, the case is cheap but that's relatively unimportant.Just in case you're wondering, you get the following denominations:150 $1100 $5100 $25100 $10025 $50025 $1000I personally could use fewer $1 chips in favor of some $10 chips, but all in all I'm pretty satisfied."
5,An Amazing Series,"One of my all time favorites, along with Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu and Shoushitsu. And it's even in a boxset version!Most Recommended!"
1,cheap material?,"My son got this driver for Christmas, and used it three times before it broke on the driving range. One swing, and the head broke, flying half way across the range.It's more disappointing, because he liked the thing. He liked the range it had."
5,Very Satisfied!,I bought this driver for my husband so he'd stop using my driver...and he loves it! He doesn't slice the ball nealy as often now and he thanks me every time we go play a round!
2,Okay club,Once I got this club I liked the looks of it. First time I used it I was not that impressed. Really lacked distance. I have since bought a Cleveland Hi Bore XLS and the ball justs pops off the face. Added at least 20 yds with it off the tee.
1,Great driver if you want to play from the OTHER fairway!,"I do get some good hits with this thing, but I have far more bad ones. Maybe it's just me swinging poorly but with my old Dunlop driver I hit about 75% in the fairway, with this club I'm at around 15%. Maybe Tiger Woods can hit it, but I can't."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Used this driver at the range last night for the first time. It felt nice and I was hitting pretty good until, ""pop"" the head snapped right off after hitting about 30 balls. Guess I'll have to spend a little more for a quality club. This is definitely not it."
1,more blather from the scorge of meaningless amazon reviews,just goes on and on about nothing. just like the reviews going nowhere that searchers have to put up with. just a lackey for publishers and labels that fills up amazon product pages with wordy tripe. the only emotional investment seeps through in this book and in careful(though unrevealing) writing technique which brings in the money. enjoy your wealth. it comes at the expense of both good intention and general honesty toward the reader.
5,"War songs: metaphors... of truth, destruction, and love.","I read WAR SONGS on a Sunday afternoon. And even though the volume is short, it is not an easy read. I was never in Viet Nam, but through the author's eyes and in the poetic lines of his experience, I was able to glimpse a bit into the horror and uncertainty of that time as it played out for Grady Harp and his young friends... the soldiers he met, cared for, and sometimes, lost. His style is spare and to the point, but gets to the heart of his feelings in a literate and flowing fashion. I found myself reading each one out-loud so that I could get the full impact of each piece. From reading his book, I worry that we, as a country, have still not learned much about life and the consequences of war since America's hellish days in Viet Nam. But, I do know one thing, Grady Harp remembers, this book remembers, and both are survivors that have lived to tell the truth."
5,Poems of deep compassion and unflinching honesty,"I find it difficult to put into words the emotions stirred by the poems of War Songs. Rarely have I read such a candid expression of suffering, so raw and immediate, yet somehow stately and sublime--Whitmanesque at times. It seems obvious to me that the contrast is the result of experiences so horrific that they lie beyond my comprehension. I am filled with sorrow by these poems for all of those who survived--however marginally--the unspeakable tragedy and trauma of Vietnam, for they must carry with them forever the memories of such carnage. That a poet like Grady Harp endures the scars he so openly reveals in ""War Songs,"" and somehow continues to live with such sensitivity, generosity and aesthetic intelligence fills me with admiration and faith in humanity."
3,Look at the Title!!!,"I have watched this documentary and though it may not be very good, it still does not deserve the kind of trash being written about it in the reviews. First and foremost, this is a documentary about Kurt Cobain ( I mean just look at the title!!!). So all those expecting concert footage or nirvana music or even spotlight on other band members are sure to be bitterly disappointed. THe documentary itself starts off with a note: ""No nirvana recording or music feature in this programme"".Obviously then, this documentary is best watched by Kurt Cobain followers or people who want to look into Cobain's legacy and what and how he influenced the early 90's music scene."
3,recommend but,I think that this is a fairly good documentary but it also does get very boring if you watch it all the through. What it lacked was there was no Nirvana music in the dvd.
2,"Very informational, but boring at best","Great source of Nirvana's lesser-known history, but all in all, this could not grab my attention to save it's soul. It seems like something we are forced to watch in school. If you are into informational videos, or just a total Nirvana FANATIC, sure, go buy this DVD, but like I said, you most probably won't like it."
4,Lets you know a bit about events in Kurdt's life...,"... This has no videos, performances, or tracks of Nirvana music. However, getting to know Kurdt through the eyes of friends, neighbors, and (even) enemies of his person is quite interesting. I'm not exactly sure how many people can just listen to others talk in monotone voices about him for 4 hours though. It does well to make people that put down Kurdt and Nirvana for either no reason, or for something that they heard that someone heard about him/them look ridiculous though. The guy at the begining is just to show how many are just ill-informed about Kurdt, and should (maybe) watch the film."
1,Just utterly terrible,"No one really knows what they are talking about in this film. People just seem to talk. It's just bad. I can't say one good thing about it. There is no footage of Nirvana outside of some interview footage, which really isn't even that good. Most of the film is listening to people that kind of, sort of, might have known Kurt Cobain. It's just bad. Don't buy!"
1,WHAT WAS THIS ALL ABOUT????,I TINK THE VIDEO WAS POORLY MADE. IT LEFT YOU WITH NO USEFUL INFORMATION AFTERWARDS... IT LACKED EVERYTING THAT GOES INTO A WELL MADE DOCUMENTRY.
1,The worst musical video ever made on any artist or band ever,"I bought this video knowing that it wouldn't be good. But, I was horrified when I actually saw it myself. This video doen't even deserve the one star. The interviews were with people who knew nothing about what Nirvana was. And the people who were saying that they were the fans of Nirvana seemed to say it just because they wanted to be in the video. PLease, I request you not to buy this video if you like Nirvana. But if you don't appreciate them and their music(which is highly unlikely), then go ahead show it to your friends and tell them how crap Nirvana was."
2,not even worth it for $16!,"It was not a good start...the first words were that ""this video contains no actual music by Nirvana"". It turns out to be a bunch of lame interviews with people who apparently were worth interviewing to someone involved in the making of this disappointing piece...why don't they release ""Live! Tonight! Sold Out!"" on DVD??????? That's at least done by Kurt himself and has music/performances!"
1,"Please, I'm begging you........dont buy this!","This is just rubbish. If you want footage of the band, interviews, music, rare stuff, insight into the life and times of kurt cobain......Sorry, it has none. The people on it knew or heard of Kurt Cobain, but there is none of him or Nirvana on it. Abit of a flop really."
1,Kurt would be disappointed!!!!!!!!!,"Well first of all, the video wasn't anything! I probably could make a video of Kurt's life and make it a 5 star movie! I am the biggest Kurt Cobain fan in the world. I am all for Kurt movies, but this was a big dissapointment! Any Nirvana fans out there don't buy this. Get the ""Live Tonight-Sold Out"" video it's alot better! Only people who like to waste money should get this!!!!"
2,Do not recommend,"While being quite an interesting documentary to those that do now know the band very well, I found it being quite boring. The DVD consists of a number of interviews with some people that are in one way or the other related to the band, and little bits of footage. Some of the interviewed people were very annoying. One person overanalyzed the bands success way too much. The best bit of the DVD was the photographers stories, and his photography were quite good and interesting. While I have not seen any other videos or documentaries related to the Seattle music scene or Nirvana, I recommend you look elsewhere."
1,"IF YOU EVER GET A HOLD OF THIS MOVIE ""BURN IT!!""","THIS MOVIE DOESN'T EVEN DISERVE THE NAME""KURT COBAIN"" ON IT! THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SAW! NOBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT! THEY JUST RAMBLED ON ABOUT SOMETHING THEY PRETENDED THEY UNDERSTOOD! IF KURT COBAIN SAW THIS MOVIE HE WOULD ""KILL"" THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT! DO NOT BUY! IF YOU WAN'T TO SEE A GOOD MOVIE ABOUT KURT COBAINS FORSHADOWING LIFE I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT ""KURT AND COURTNEY"""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"this is an unnofficial documentary that has no live performances, and no interviews with anyone worth talking to. all they do is talk to people that LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN as him, and give little random facts about kurt cobain. for christ sake one of the people interiviewed comments on his music and says ""smells like TEAM spirit"", WHAT THE HELL?!?? this is the stupidest excuse for a biography i've ever seen.DO NOT BUY THIS."
4,Winding down the thread,"This book was profound, but easy enough to read in a La-z-boy if thats your style. It's a series of short stories all joined by a common thread, the narmada river. Filled with hindu ascetics and Indian playboys, A River Sutra should be the first book you read about India-its kind of like a primer to India's often ignored jungles. This book flows, and its not sketchy like some other writers who write about India."
3,"A novel rich in Indian heritage, yet universal in its themes","Rich with cultural flavor, A River Sutra combines the River Narmada's myths and legends with human experience. Gita Mehta has woven the universality of love into the many stories in the novel. Each fable has the ironic charm and the twists of a bestseller. The portrait of the most sacred river in India enlightens the reader with its cultural heritage. Like so many writers of foreign cultures, she manages to find a slant on love that reaches out to all ages. Two thumbs up."
4,Denial of the world or Acceptance of all things,"This is a beautiful novel about the search for the enlightenment of the human heart. The main character is a hotel manager who had recently left the business world to run a small rest house near the Narmada River. During that time he runs across others who are also looking for the same inner peace. From their stories he learns more about himself and his search for self satisfaction. My personal favorite character is the Naga Baba, an ascetic to the god Vishnu. His own personal quest for enlightenment leads him to both isolation from and acceptance to the civilized world. All the while the river runs through as a constant symbol of the human search for truth and happiness and trying to find a balance of the two."
4,"Absorbing narrative, two thumbs up!","Collection of short narratives keeping a retired government officer and the Narmada River in the background. Each tale brought out a different flavor of life in India. Very good treatment of the characters and the storylines. Slick narrative, wonderfully woven tales. Strongly recommended for anyone who's interested in Indian life and particularly modern Indian English writing!"
4,A simple pleasure to read.,"Mehta accomplishes a meditation on the Eastern philosophy of life, love, and death without the usual stuffy intellectualization. The lack of character development is compensated by the rich exploration of spirituality. This book makes one assess their own life."
4,An enchanting tale of human emotion,"Along the banks of the Narmada River in India, a bureaucrat retires to reflect in a seemingly separate sphere of reality. The narrator hears anecdotes about greif, suffering and love from many different sources, among them a monk, an worried mother, a wise mullah, and a possessed businessman. One theme of the novel lies in the fact that all people, regardless of religion, culture, or upbringing, experiece frighteningly similar emotions. During the course of his reflections, the narrator realized that he could not flee the world at a rest house on the Narmada River, for ""too many lives converge on (its) banks."" A River Sutra reminds readers of the common thread of human emotion that links us all. Though it is not a lengthy novel, A River Sutra leaves a reader emotionally satisfied and, indeed, ready to reflect upon his or her own life."
3,"Draws connections between love, death, struggle and pleasure","A River Sutra is a wonderfully composed story, intertwining the lives of very different charictors. The novel focuses around a inn keeper who lives on the River Narmada and meets travelers as they pass by. Each traveler relates a story to the narrator...some uplifting, some tragic. But each story, no matter how differnt, finds connections to eachother, proving that lives, no matter how different, are connected by the fundamentals of love and truth. A true glimpse into the universiality of the human heart."
1,Dull,"What has happened to this author's sparkle? Mehta's first book, Karma Cola was amusing, this novel on the other hand, is deathly dull."
4,This book was a keen examination of indian heritage.,This book did a good job of writing about modern themes in relation to ancient mythology. It was well written with vivid imagery and symbolism.
4,Excellent literary work that examines many lifelong themes,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""A River Sutra"". The manner in which Ms. Mehta presents the ideas of the book, through the various experiences of several others, which ultimately leaves an impact on the main character, the narrator. The lessons of love and the attainment of self-fulfillment are very uniqueing dipicted. The text is also very rich in Indian culture and imagery which enhances the experience. This book was a pleasure to read and I recommend it to anyone interested in exploring another culture while learning universal truths."
4,Heavy Radics riddims carry sweet soulful voice,"A lesser known McGregor CD, but rates very highly for those who like the heavy radics sound. Especially prominent is the no-nonsense bomb-drop Bass of Flabba Holt, backbone of the roots Radics. No drum machine here. If you like the ""Big Ship"" sound, this won't be a disappointment."
2,Repair Issues on Handle of Hose,"This is the only Miele S4 Galaxy I have ever repaired. I have repaired several Miele Orions. They all have the same problem. The radio controlled hose controls. This technology is new, and has had problems since day one. They all have been warranty repairs so far, but expensive parts after warranty period. Great cleaning, but some major technology problems in the hose. The antenna for the radio controlled hose also has some issues. The antenna will bend over and point down, which causes difficulty when trying to change the speeds up and down, and turning the vacuum on/off from the hose can be challenging as well. Best idea is to avoid this canister."
5,We enjoyed it,"My 5 year-old daughter and I really enjoyed played Spirit together. The game presents a series of puzzles and challanges that Spirit must solve to rescue his friends. There is some reading involded, so I think she'll also like playing it again by herself in a couple of years."
5,Pilgrim's Progress,"My 5 year old loves this book. I had it sitting out and as soon as he found the picture of the dragon, he wanted to read it right away. I think I like reading this more than the original, which I couldn't finish even in the modern translation."
1,crap,this is one of the worst books i have ever read and i read alot of them i would not recamend this book to anyone.
5,Dale Jr Cola Car,Came in a timely manner. Was in great condition. Will be a great addition to my collection as I collect a lot of Coke items. I also collect other Nascar items so will add also to that collection.
3,compare with blu-ray disc & dvd,"If the product is Blu-ray Disc, I think it will better than dvd. The item which I purchased is quite good, if it is Blu-ray disc, it is the best!!"
5,I'll never try another toothbrush again--this is it!,"I never thought I would write a review raving about how great a new toothbrush was. I never thought in my lifetime I would ever see a meaningful innovation in toothbrushes...I used to laugh at the idea of someone actually spending their day trying to improve a toothbrush.But then...it happened. The Colgate 360.I got the medium one, and the cheek cleaner works kinda gently and is pretty minor, but thats not what I am excited about. The design with the two smaller inner circle brushes reminds me of what you see plastered outside your car window when you go through a car wash. It seems somehow that they brush counter to the outer brushes, and it gives the feeling of one of the auto-rotating toothbrushes but somehow seems even better. It seems like it's actively polishing your teeth while at the same time penetrating all of the different gaps between them.I can't really do this thing justice in my weak attempts to describe it...just try it and see."
1,Condition was not as claimed,"CD was rated as being in Very Good condition but was not. Not only was the CD scratched and worn, it was missing one of the two CDs it was supposed to contain. I returned it."
4,sugar bowl,"I really like it. I have other new wave items as well and like them all. Shape is nice and it is well made. The only draw back is the ""tab"" to lift the lid is a bit slippery so be careful to get a good grip on it."
2,Enormous,You should only get this if you want an enormous red vibrator in your possession. Great for embarrassing someone at a party. I would assume NOT intended for actual use.
5,Works well in combination...,"This was a product recommended for me to help reduce stress. I find it works well in combination with a healthy diet, regular exercise, 7 hours of sleep and other stress-reducing activities."
1,Very bad product,"After I installed this, the computer freezes on startup and I couldn't even shut down properly. The CPU utilisation shows 100% all the time.I finally removed the Spyware Doctor from the system, and now the computer is back to normal.I am very disappointed with this product.Not sure if its because I also have a Norton Antivirus on my system.If anyone has found the solution, appreciate if they can share"
1,Spyware Doctor crippled my computer,"I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing this item. Almost the day it was installed, we started having problems. The computer would freeze anytime an application was opened. We couldn't use Microsoft Outlook or Internet Explorer without turning off the Spyware Doctor. It used so much memory, there was no room for any application to run. Even turned off, it somehow seemed to be creating problems. The computer was freezing frequently and I couldn't even shut down properly. I finally removed the Spyware Doctor from the system completely, and now the computer is back to normal. Spyware Doctor is going in the trash."
4,PC Spyware Doctor 2007,"This is an excellent product. It found ""garbage"" on my computer that no other program found. The free on line scan found it but wouldn't remove it, so I bought it, btw-no other on line free scan found a thing. I feel it is a wise addition to any & all other security software you may be using. I would have given it a 5 star rating except that it slows my computer down a bit but not enough to warrant removing it. A wise buy-reasonably priced & does an excellent job. A must buy if you want to be ""secure.""I have used this product for about 3 months now. I had to uninstall it. CPU usage is minimum 50%. PC Spyware Doctor 2007 started off great..slowly over time it slowed my computer down to a snails pace. I no longer give it 4 stars...I now give it 2 stars. It is no longer, in my opinion, ""a must buy""...I won't buy it again."
1,Effective if you don't want to do anything else,"I agree 100% with the criticisms I have seeen here. I found that, contrary to the salesman's claims, it conflicted with Norton and completely froze my computer. When I installed it in safe mode, it worked (that is it scanned and so on), but slowed my computer's performance to the point where it took 10 minutes just to access my home page. Since it found no problems anyway, I have removed it and will not reinstall it."
1,spyware doctor is a quack,"It used to work before version 5, but now kills my PC. My only option was to restore to an earlier date. A "".dll"" file was then missing and it would not automatically run - thank goodness. Version five point whatever is worse than junk. I was able to 'fix' my PC by 'restore', and when I downloaded SD again, the same thing happened. I don't need to download it a third time to prove to myself that is the problem. It killed the PC speed to almost nothing each time it was re-installed."
1,DO NOT BUY SPYWARE DOCTOR,"Do not buy this product!!!! It's a terrible product sold by an invisible company. You cannot contact them. They will not respond. It will freeze-up your computer. You cannot uninstall it. And the company will continue to charge our credit card. If you buy it, you'll be sorry and don't say that I didn't warn you!!!!"
1,Hidden Auto-Renew,"Do not buy anything from PC Tools without understanding that there is a yearly auto renew included in the agreement. This web company just want to pick up your money. You should stay away from the PC Tools payment processor ""Element 5"" too.This software is a bag of crabs, period. It slows your PC as you can't imagine and is impossible to completly remove without formating.Again Stay away.Good Luck."
1,version 5 is a disaster,Over the weekend (9/15 AND 9/16 2007) I have had to uninstall this product from multiple systems. The phone never stopped ringing. Apparently they put out a disasterous release within the last week or so. Couldn't even turn the product off just had to uninstall.
1,"If you DON'T want to use your computer, then install this code","I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory. So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE! Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products."
2,Not what I hoped for,I guess I was hoping for a much more in depth how to. I learned some things on the topic but not enough. I wanted to learn how to do this for myself instead it seemed more like a show case of his work.
2,Not as described - containers don't stack,"The description reads ""Easily stacked for maximum space utilization"". Don't be fooled. They 'nest' but they don't stack. Bought four of them to use in my freezer but they're totally useless because they can't be stacked on top of one another. Now I have to pay to ship them back because of the misleading description."
5,"Top quality, worth the price!","I was skeptical about the price, but I love art, and I decided to splurge this weekend.I hadn't heard of Van Gogh before, but this Van dude came up with some awesome paintings, and I think I happened to pick one of his best in ""Starry Night"". It's has big stars and is at night, just like its name, and it goes great with my sofa!It says ""Made in China"" on the back and is of superior quality and craftsmanship, with bright, cheerful colors and superb glossy paint. Those who have told me otherwise (""A fake""??? Look at the signature and the certificate of authenticity!) are obviously racist, or more likely, just jealous.I cannot even imagine how I had ever managed to enjoy Tuscan milk in my living room every evening before getting this masterpiece. I'd like to get another for my dining room."
3,Just a clarification for North Americans,"This is the UK version of the first American-released Bellydance Superstars DVD, but with a different cover and a bonus CD. It's not a new release."
3,Wicca,"This is a very simple basic book, it doesn't bother to go deep into the philosophy or history behind the Craft, and I've seen better books for begginers."
3,Not all Witches Are Wiccans.,"And Wicca is just one of the Pagan paths. This is the main thing I wish to point out in this review. Obviously, the author practices a different type of Witchcraft, this does not make it any less valid. This is more similar to Dianic Wicca, in that it focuses on the Goddess. You can see this by the title, so don't get a shock. Though this is not my form of paganism, I respect her, and other Goddess orientated Witches & Pagans. ...The Goddess is a powerful force... She is the Earth, she is the Universe, she is the Mother of All. The Goddess can include the male, in a way that the male cannot include the female. Why is it less valid to refer to a neuter force as female, than male? Especially considering the creative principle involved? With cells that reproduce asexually, we refer to Daughter cells, even if they have no 'sex' as such. My last paragraph is part my own beliefs, and part an explanation of Goddess centric Paganism. Live in peace, Keladras."
5,To the moron below me,"So they let COPS use Bad Boys as a theme song. So what? They're still a first-rate Reggae band, and you are an idiot for disliking them for that reason.NO stars for Hey Now."
5,This is amazing! Never get lost ever again!,"Bought 4 months ago and can not live without, just and amazing device, has 12 channels! There is no way you can not love this GPS, has all the features that others have as ""options"" huge database built in, iluminated panel for night use, easy and fast responses just superb.Had the smaller versions from Garmin, but I now know you get what you pay for! Magellan still beats my new Garmin( 2 months old) constantly used while camping it is a must have, I highly recommend if you are going to depend on a GPS get the 410.( By the way sold my ""newer"" GPS to my neighbor :) kept the Magellan 410 of course!)"
2,Ree gun,"I love the sound design, I love the content. Important history for all Americans, even still.I like the accent of the wheezy narration- the Eagle in the comic.But there are just incredibly stupid mispronounciations: Reagan pronounced ""Reegun"" (repeatedly) is the most head slappingly stupid oversight.Junta, pronounced ""Joon tuh"" instead of ""hoon ta"". It's not Nicauragua, it's Nik ar ah goo uh with an extra syllable (British style?).Albert Hakim: ""HAY kim"", emphasis on the first syllable. Secord: Emphasis on the second syllable: see KORD.These are major figures in the narrative, yet the voice artist can't be bothered to learn how to pronounce their names?"
3,Check the supported cards!,"The product works well, but unfortunately it doesn't support xD cards, which I neglected to notice before I ordered it. Make sure you read the list of supported formats and decide whether they'll be enough for you; if you get a new card later on, you might regret this hub."
2,Bet with your own luck!,"My two PC and one laptop all have trouble from time to time when trying to use this IOGEAR USB hub. For example, (1) if the hub is plugged in before booting up, it will take a much long time for the PC to show the Windows welcome screen; (2) the PC will hanged during the shut down step if the HUB still connected; (3) The PC can't recognize all ports on the hub from time to time; (4) some time keep asking me to format a CF card which has data inside.I had few IOGEAR products at home and they are not performing very well, guess I won't buy from this brand any more."
2,"Convenient, but can't power/charge some devices","I purchased this hub for the convenience of having a card reader and usb hub, all in one. It works fine as a card reader using Mac OSX. Cards show up on the desktop and transfer speeds are acceptable. I use an external bus-powered hard drive (2.5"" 5400rpm), and it will not spin up if connected to this hub, even though the hub does have its own power supply. I've also had no luck charging my Garmin Forerunner 205 GPS watch. If these things are essential to you then I'd recommend trying another approach. If you're content using thumb drives, media cards, and devices that don't need to be bus-powered, this seems like a nice solid device."
4,"Not perfect , but the next closest thing","Needed a few more USB ports and since I already had a Card Reader tying up one of my USB ports this seemed like the way to go. So far it has lived up to my expectations. The only thing that could be improved is the decktop bracket, which has a tendency to fall off but other than that for the price it works great."
2,Not Powered Enough,"Unfortunately, this nice looking package just doesn't pack the power punch needed. I have an Epson printer, a Saitek joystick, a gamepad and my dell monitor (with 2 usb ports) plugged into the back of the IOGEAR and several times throughout the day my computer will ""bonk"" and state USB device is not connected, only to redetect the device a few seconds later.Would not work at all with a Dell9150 I use at work. :( Fortunately it works great as a card reader on my xp sp2 asus based home system."
1,Piece of junk,"This device lasted less than a year. I plugged in and it worked fine at first, then all of a sudden started having problems. Couldn't tell if it was the USB port in the PC or the hub/reader until THE JACK ON THE BACK OF THE UNIT SNAPPED AND FELL INTO THE HUB! I would recommend you stay away from this brand.And yes, the stand was useless."
1,hardly works,"The plug sockets work only intermitently and after troubleshooting a little too many times and ending up unplugging it, Im going to return it.I didnt even use the card reader...but if the plugs dont work, whats the use?Avoid this!"
3,"If it worked with Vista, it'd be great","I purchased the Iogear Hub for use with my Vista laptop to have some additional USB 2.0 ports and to easily get pictures off our Memory Stick and CompactFlash cards. while the unit works correctly on my wife's Windows XP laptop, it is not recognized on mine running Windows Vista.Technical support was easy to reach and had some suggestions to solve the problem. It looks as though I may have to send the unit back to them for repair, though it is it still unclear whether this will fix the problem. I was told there are no drivers needed, everything is already included in Vista to use the hub.Overall the unit is pretty small and offers all of the functionality I need. It if worked correctly I'd be thrilled with it. It does need to be plugged in, so making sure you have enough open power outlets near your computer is critical."
3,Poor Quality Control,"My hub arrived with the internal ""circuit board"" off center from the outer plastic shell. I own both SD and CF cards. The larger CF cards would fit into their slot, albeit a bit crooked. The smaller SD cards, on the other hand, were impossible to insert due to the misalignment. I am returning for replacement -- maybe another unit will be better. It does look like a rather nice device otherwise."
2,Broke in 3 months,It worked fine for about 3 months and then it broke. too bad because the design is good
1,Defective piece of junk! - 0 star,"I got this some time last year, but like many things I buy I didn't use it right away and just stored it, until last week. First time out of the package I used it and it worked fine. Second time I tried to use it about a week later and it won't even power on, so only got to use it one time, so disappointing. No matter what I do it won't turn on. What a piece of junk. Though it's been a long time since I purchased this piece of junk I'm going to try to return it for an exchange so I don't lose my money, if not from Amazon, then from IOGEAR. Don't bother getting this product. It's a Zero."
1,Very Buggy,"It looks nice although the vertical stand is useless. Sounds good to. 6 USB2 ports and a card reader.Unfortunately it is badly flawed. It'll pause and restart during file transfer using the card reader, corrupting files in the process. Additionally, if you leave a card in the reader your computer will every so often redetect it and pop up a window. Can get very annoying as it interupts whatever you are doing or wkaes your computer if suspended. Lastly, it has the same pause and restart problem with the USB ports. If you are trying to print through this hub you are in for a tough time. This thing cost me a lot in paper and ink before I went back to my previous hub.I've used other hubs and readers on this computer with no trouble. This one though is going back to IOgear."
2,Doesn't play nice with multiple peripherals,"I have this connected to my laptop, and it doesn't work with my all-in-one printer scanner. It appears to have throughput issues. The card reader works fine, hence the 2stars."
5,No complaints,"I've been using this with my Powerbook and have been having no problems. I have hooked this up to two external hard drives, an external CD-RW, an external DVD-RW and various other things. The card reader works great. I've put my memory sticks in there as well as other memory cards and it read them with no problems. I haven't tried the stand yet because it fits the space I have for it just right when it's laid down, but it doesn't look like it can hold the hub when things are plugged in. If you want a great hub and don't have a card reader, give this product a shot."
2,Stick to 'Broken Stones' for short fiction.,"Dan Simmons is no doubt a great writer... 'Hyperion', 'Carrion Comfort', and 'Song of Kali' are all great books, but this collection of novellas is a total disappointment. I think the problem lies in the fact that Simmons is moralizing here on subjects that he cares about (like the horrors of AIDS) and it's getting in the way of his usual magical style of storytelling. With the story subservient to the moral, we the readers are left to consider Simmons' ethical point of view, which in the case of ""Dying in Bangkok"", is downright offensive. It's not hard to understand why this book is out of print. Stick with 'Prayers To Broken Stones' if you want to experience Simmons' shorter works of fiction."
1,Disappointed!,"I did not enjoy these short stories at all. Some were rather vulgar and I felt like I was reading porn. Not all the stories were like that, but some just didn't make any sense. However, Dan Simmons is a great writer (except for ""Lovedeath"") and I will continue to purchase his books."
5,Hot Dog Halloween Costume,"It looks just as cute as the picture, the costume is well made and looks best on Daschund's, we love it."
1,Sooooo cheaply made! Not quite as pictured.,"I bought the medium for my 14 lb dacshund. The package arrived pretty quickly, however as soon as I took it out of the package, I saw just how cheaply made it was. The mustard piece is not actually attached to a strip of fabric the way it is shown in the picture. Instead, it is loosely sewn to the Velcro strips and one end of the mustard strip had already come off so it was flopping around. The Velcro strips are very narrow and will not hold up if there is any slight pull on them. A waste of $8.Side comment- the package lists a bunch of dog breeds that this is meant for and doesn't even state the obvious one which would be a dacshund!"
2,Poorly Made...,"I bought this for my puppy and found when I opened the box that it was broken. The velcro was only attached to one side and the thread was still on the other side, like it had come apart before anyone in my house had even touched it. I am far from a seamstress and had no needle and thread so I had to go out and buy it to fix the costume before he even wore it.It was cute once I got it fixed...but I just wondered if it was worth the trouble. I could have got one at Target that wasn't broken for less (I found out later.)"
4,Earrings,"I was very happy with the look and quality of these earrings. They were a little smaller than I expected, but are beautiful!"
3,ok,"Product was is great condition but it was oddly wrapped and took a while to get here. (not late, but the shipper wasn't in a hurry to get it here either.)"
3,not {live} to bad!!!!!,"i order this cd but it's not live, i only wanted live but has some good songs on this cd"
5,will offend Christian fundamentalists - great for research,"This book demonstrates the evolution of the Bible as we eventually wound up with it. This is NOT a book for people in possession of a conclusion searching for a premise. It will definitely offend Christian and Hebrew Fundamentalists, but then they have an enormous stake in maintaing their sense of place and livelihood with the status quo. Buy this book for an IMPARTIAL look at the history of what constitutes the bible."
4,Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic,"I bought this book because I am totally ignorant about the history of this area. I found it very interesting, but am not adequate to the task of reviewing the information. I learned a lot and also skimmed through a lot that I had no clue about. It is easy for a beginner to get bogged down, but worth the attempt."
2,resource rich substance poor,"This book is overburdened with pointers to other works which may not be familiar to the reader. It is also very poor on drawing conclusions from the bewildering amount of insubstantial information that it contains. Lets face it, if language describing Yahweh is virtually the same as that describing Baal we should be able to draw a reasonably clear conclusion that the writers share a very similar religious culture. Way too cautious for my liking although obviously very well researched."
2,MY error.,"This is a hippy dippy 1960's leather vest, wrist band, macrame and similar book. Paper is old comic book feel and look. Certainly not what I expected to see. Paid a premium for it versus other book sellers. Never again via Amazon."
4,Say it right in German,"This is a short book with basic phrases in it. Each phrase builds off another in an attempt to increase your conversational needs. The book has a key of small circles, and the sounds they make. It is very easy to get the hang of it and to learn to speak the words properly. However, you should still listen to a native speaker to understand the subtle nuances of pronunciation."
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!","Excellent - I'm not from a Jewish background and have never heard most of this music, but I love it! Rachel is an outstanding musician and her presentation along with those lovely melodies have truly touched my heart. I listen to this CD very often."
1,micro sized,"My husband ordered this, thinking it would be bigger. It's TINY! What a joke. This is way overpriced for the size. Lesson learned: read the product dimensions before clicking the order button. High return shipping charges make this not worth returning. What a waste of money."
3,Read the fine print (?),So small it's like a cat's toy. This is NOT anywhere near the size of a normal Nerf. I does however throw nice.
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen! Earl Owensby ""stars"" in this poorly written, poor acted, poorly everything movie of the classic wolfman story. Although the movie is set in Scotland, all of the actors (with the exception of one or two) speak in a thick Southern accent. The clothing is late 19th century at one point, and then towards the end of the movie the actors are inexplicably dressed in modern clothing. Earl Owensby is known for his independent film studio in Shelby, NC and his entrepreneurial prowess in that field. However, ""Wolfman"" goes to show that just because you have enough money to produce a movie does not mean that you should! This movie is good for a hoot if you enjoy seeing just how bad a movie can be. What did I like about this movie? That is was over."
5,Our Gang,"OW-WOO! Werewolves of London! I will need to put on a big pot of coffee before we talk about these characters. They came around to my neck of the woods only now and again, appearing at night (like some Hollywood types I knew) when wolfbane bloomed and the moon was full.OW-WOO!Henry Hull was ""The Werewolf of London"" in a thriller, Michael Pare was cool in ""Bad Moon Rising,"" but Lon Chaney Jr's wolfman was the big favorite. His hair was always perfectPoor guy ended up either on a slab in a lab somewhere or at the bottom of a cliff.Abbott and Costello killed him. Universal cast him,, the Frankenstein monster, and Dracula in supporting roles in ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" so Costello could poke fun ar them.""Oh, you don't understand,"" Chaney cried. ""Tonight, when the noon is full, I'll turn into a wolf!""Said Costello: ""You and 20 milliom other guys"""
3,Not too bad.,"I am a fan of low-budget horror movies, and this definitely fits that genre. For what it is, the production, plot, and effects are all really good. There is one graveyard scene where they are standing in front of a horrible back drop, but that is the only part that looked really hokey. As in most Earl Owensby movies, the weakness here is in the acting. In this case, however, it is normally so bad that it is humorous and tends to make the movie more entertaining. If you are looking to be artistically enlightened, this is not the movie for you. If you are just looking for a couple of hours of goofy fun, Wolfman isn't bad at all."
2,Bronguideze Bow study,It was not want I was looking for. No chapter summaries. It is more a teacher's helper.
1,Feel jipped!,"You ONLY get ONE glue stick for $4.80. Don't fall for the 10 after the description, means it's 10 inches long. You don't get 10 sticks ONLY ONE!!! Feel jipped!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,Ridiculous Price for a SINGLE Glue Stick,"I think the seller is deliberatly trying to deceieve people into thinking they are getting 10 glue sticks when in fact, your getting ONE glue stick.Who would buy JUST ONE glue stick anyway?I added this to my wish list months ago, and when I ordered it, I didn't read the comments."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Should have read the other reviews!!!! You only get one stick. Nowhere in the add does it say 10 ""inches"". Bogus!"
5,"Truly a ""Victory""","I've been listening to Half Pint since High School. I have his Classics and Classics in Dub, also have the Ras Portraits. This one of the finest albums he's made. With song's like ""She's gone"" and ""Mary Long Tongue"", it's definately worth it."
2,Outdated,"The book's cover and title were a big draw for me as an amateur naturalist. The book's content however, is really just a travel guide. The information is not about nature, or adventure travel in particular, just the standard travel stuff. In addition, the information is outdated. Buy a newer, up to date travel guide."
3,Leather case purchase,The leather case was shipped and received quickly and as described. Very satisfied with the transaction although the case is a bit bulkier than expected but functional.
4,Publisher's Note for the 2007 reprint by Clearfield Publishing:,"From the founding of the first official church in 1683, the Baptist Church grew prodigiously in South Carolina. Leah Townsend's superior history of the development of the Baptist Church in South Carolina emphasizes the growth of the Church in the Low-Country, the Peedee Section, Charleston, and the Back Country, and gives a county-by-county breakdown of the various churches, with statistics of members, dates, and names of ministers. Of greatest interest to genealogists are the membership lists of the various associations and congregations which are interspersed throughout the narrative and in footnotes, many of which supply genealogical data of the first rank. In all, something like 7,000 individuals are identified in this book."
5,Buying more,My tractor gets holes in the tires all the time-too much Mesquite and Cactus on my place you know. I have already used a whole 30+ pack on the various tires holes and they work great. Tried to to be cheap once and cut the patches in two but then they are not as good and will have a slow leak. If you use the whole plug they work just fine. I have even used some to patch nail holes on my Toyota truck tire and they are holding still. The tire is near the end of its tread life anyway. I really like these things and they saved me the cost and hassle of taking the truck tire to get patched. With the tractor I have no idea how much time and money it has saved me but its a lot.
3,good servants are hard to find but love is more important,"Mr. Burton Crane (the book says he is under 30) rents a house from ""one of the most aristocratic families south of the Mason and Dixon's"", with the understanding that it comes complete with servants. The butler seems young for his job but looks like he will function very well. The cook is beautiful and cooks like a dream. The maid is rather sullen and ungracious. And the 'Useful Boy' is inclined to be impertinent. Within a few days Burton moves into his leased home with his lawyer, his almost fiancee and her mother. It doesn't take very long for the servants to make life difficult for Burton with amusing results. But, boy, can the cook deliver some delicious dishes. And she's beautiful, sweet and nice to talk to. This story is easy to read, and is not too long. I think I enjoyed reading it more the second time. - posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"
2,Disappointed,I thought this story would be funny and entertaining but could not get past the second chapter. The character descriptions were too wordy and it seemed like it was an old movie plot from the 20's. I was disappointed it was just taking so long for the author to develop her story about the romance.
5,Very cute story for little princesses.,"My 4 year old loves princesses and she enjoys this cute little book about Jessica, a young lady who likes to play make-believe princess. She even has a tea party with her other princess friends. A delightful book for little princesses everywhere!"
5,Limited Numbered Edition,"This rare set from Micro Machines was made in 1994 and then discontinued, the Galoob company closed down in 1998. THis set is a special Limited Edition, and each box is numbered. Micro Machines are very tiny, less than half the size of a Hot Wheels car. The ships have display stands inside the box. There are 4 Star Wars vehicles, and 4 tiny figure characters. So there is an X-Wing Starfighter, the Milleniun Falcon, Snowspeeder and a B-Wing Starfighter. The figures include Admiral Ackbar, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo."
5,One of the most unique films made,"This is an excellent movie. Has humor but is mostly drama -- showing the struggles of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles.Is in Spanish with English subtitles, so it's better if you are bilingual or don't mind reading subtitles. Very well directed. The scene in the sewer with the rats was so well done that S. Spielberg contacted the director to ask how they did it.A sad but thought provoking ending."
5,Movie review,Excellent movie! One of the most heart rendering movies ever produced. The story is probably never-ending and heartbreaking but hopeful. The movie should be revived and viewed by new generations to be appreciated.
5,a cinemagraphic masterpiece,"This film is a visual and audio masterpiece. I first saw it as a univeristy student on my campus. Then i happened on it when Rite Aid was closing out its video store for ten bucks. I use it for teaching my Spanish classes. My students are able to see Mayan culture and hear the language. They are also able to hear the distinction between Guatemalan and Mexican Spanish. Before I show the film I read them selections from Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigobera Menchu's autobiography, I, Rigoberta. It is important for them to understand the plight of Latin American people and their struggle for a better existence. (I'm trying to locate the soundtrack if anyone can assist me.)"
5,A Sobering Tale,"As a former Spanish major at the University of South Carolina, our professor incorporated ""El Norte"" into his lesson plan. We watched the movie during class one week and discussions followed. It is a sobering tale that is sadly common among many people who have been affected by civil war."
5,Quite possibly the best film I've ever saw.,"----SPOILERS---AHEAD--I remember when this first was shown on channel 13 way back in 1983-1984.I was 13 years old at the time.(I was born in 1970)It was a simple story to me about hardship and family.For as long as I have been alive I will never forget that image at the end.Yes, he did kill himself because he had no one after his sister died, and the thought of just struggling on and on...was too much.I understood that then, and just last night I saw the movie for the first time in over 30 years, and this film has lost NONE of it's power.You know what I'm talking about, like having not seen a movie in so long, you see it today and you laugh.Well...NOT here.Life can(and will) be grim, and this film brings it home.I lost the name of the title in my head over the years, but NEVER the story and it's imagery.My favorite movie..."
3,Good film with insight to immigration,"El Norte is a tenderhearted film that documents the journey of a brother and sister who flee their home country of Guatemala. After their family is fragmented by local government militia, Enrique and Rosita realize their only option for survival is to leave their home country and pursue a life in the north. The film follows their paths through Mexico and their struggles to gain entrance into America.The film has merit - the story is certainly compelling and the locations chosen for filming help give a realistic touch, but from a technical aspect El Norte is very elementary. The storyline also seems to be slightly formulated and the acting performances are inconsistent. With that being said, El Norte is still a good film that brings insight into the struggles of immigration and the pursuit of survival."
1,Bad Deal,"I received my dvd nicely wrapped, but when I put movie on it did not play, the title and play appear on screen, but when you hit play nothing happens. Very disapointed."
2,El Norte CD,"The product was fine, it is a latin american import, so I was unable to view it on my current cd video unit. This does not represent a negative on the distributor as he probably did not know about this, in either case I was happy with Amazon and the distributor. I have nothing but praise for AMAZON, they are very reliable and I will use them again soon. Thanks..."
2,El Norte; good or bad?,"I have just watched this movie (Well, I did not see the ending but most of it), and enjoyed seeing from the Immigrant point of view what it MAY be like to come to the US. However, it should be noted that the movie is rated R for excessive uses of the ""F"" word, and other dirty language. Also, sub titles were difficult to read at times since they would blend in with white backgrounds. The movie did not go into great detail about why the Guatamalen siblings were moving north.The movie may help you to see the struggles some immigrants face when they are in truly trying situations. But isn't there some way to do so with less language????"
1,"The wrong message, the wrong vocabulary","As other reviewers have said, this book gives kids the wrong message on so many levels. The kids in this book dread the start of the school year. I don't want my kids to feel that way! This book also has some pretty complex vocabulary for a ""Ready to Read"" book - confidence, self-esteem, volunteer, decent. It seems like it took a story aimed at much older kids and sandwiched it into this format."
2,"True, but not quite.","I don't think that Charles Schultz would be very pleased right now. Someone is taking his beloved Peanuts and making products just to make money. I love the Peanuts and I love Charlie Brown and when I saw this book in a department store, I thought, ""Great, a new Charlie Brown book."" Well, this book isn't quite the nut it's cracked up to be. Charlie Brown enters a spelling bee against the protests of his friends. He really thinks he can win, but when he finally gets his moment to shine, he messes up big time. The book ends by basically saying things are hopeless for Charlie. The ending is what really bothered me. Yes, Charlie Brown is a lovable loser, but even when he loses there's always some catharsis; he usually thinks about his loss or talks about it with Linus and the story ends on a note of positivity. Not so here. Peanuts fans are the only people I recommend this book for."
3,It's very funny we liked Amelia Bedelia.,"We thought this book was funny because of the mistakes she made.These are the mistakes she made :Jelly ROLL,String Beans,Separate the Eggs,Match the vegetables,Stripe the Beds,Check the shirts and Change the towels."
2,Thank You Amelia Bedelia,"...This is a good book to read. It was really funny. Well about the book, Amelia Bedelia was hired to be a maid. But when I read it some of the words were in script. The first thing she did she cut up all the towels."
1,What tripe!,"This is a hatchet job... nothing more and nothing less, by the far left wing of the Texas Democratic Party. The editorial comments from such leftie luminaries as Jim ""Pinko"" Hightower were as bad.As for the reader comments, I noted that not one actually LIVES in Texas.Y'all need to get over it. Gore lost. He's not coming back. Liberalism/socialism has gone the way of the dinosaur, except for those who haven't realized that they're already dead. I'm so glad I got this from the library. I wouldn't buy this used from a Poteet garage sale!"
1,What a Joke nicknamed a book,"Can people really be that misinformed about reality and what really matters? Why waste your time even reading these reviews. This is a Joke, nicknamed a book.Seek the truth in all matters, not the perception of the truth...this is very likely only someone's false perception of the truth."
4,Delicious!!!,EZ and delicious. What a great combination! Tom Ka Paste makes Thai Coconut Chicken soup w/ Lemongrass. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The soup is delicious and quick to make (under 1 hour). I would suggest that you use a coconut milk that is rich in fat for the fullest flavor would recommend Chaokoh brand found in Asian supermarkets. This soup keeps well and leftovers can be frozen.
3,Monosodium Glutamate,"For those who care, be aware that this product contains Monosodium Glutamate.Complete list of ingredients from package: Salt, Spices, Galangal, Lemongrass, Sugar, Soybean Oil, Monosodium Glutamate, Shallot, Citric Acid."
3,Simple cane,"This is a very simple cane, but for the price it really can't be beat. It's made of wood with a cheap outside finish. The finish rubs off very easily and by the end of the first day I used it, it had two nicks. Nonetheless, it's sturdy. Since it's wood it's also very easy to cut it down to the right size for you. I used a simple hacksaw and it took about 5 minutes to adjust the length. If you need or want a basic cane to help recover from injury or just aid in your stability, this is a good one to get."
5,Great for little fans,"Yes, our daughter asked Santa for this for Christmas! This set is durable, colorful and great for little Steeler fans. We have owned other similar sets for a few years and they definitely hold up with repeated use."
4,Practical and easily implemented,"Carbon Monoxide detectors are now mandatory in California. Most units are combination smoke and COdetectors; First Alert CO605 is CO-only. This unit is mounted about eight feet away from the hot waterheater.The ""Test Silence"" button feature is a real convenience, as the only means of testing the unit wouldotherwise be puffing cigarette smoke (hence a small quantity of carbon monoxide) at the detector.There are clear instructions for installation and battery management. The front-loaded battery case is both a convenience and a problem: the hatch simply drops down for the pair of AA's, but sometimes will not snap back in place securely.First Alarm CO605 warranties this unit for five years. I feel comfortable with this guaranty. I hopeI never have to hear its alarm in actual use."
4,"Functional, Inexpensive Neccessity","We've used these for years without problems.They run on batteries(2 AA included) or plug, and produce an annoyingly, loud 85dB siren. The instructions are easy to follow- a no brainer- and it's a no brainer that along with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers we should have these in our homes.They recommend one alarm on every level and every sleeping area. They list the sources of CO, e.g. chimney, garage, furnace of course, heaters, dryer, range and grill.They say they last 7 years, and it let's you know when it's shot. I think, in general, we replace them after about 4-5 years."
4,I appreciate the simplicity and ease of use,"The First Alert CO605 Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm is just what I was looking for: something easy to use, didn't take up a lot of space, didn't require elaborate set up and tools to install it, and works. I can state for a fact that this one fit all those criterion except the last, of course. I do know that the testing button works and I have to hope that it will actually work in the event there is a carbon monoxide buildup in my home. I can't test that!However, for all the other criteria, this one passed the test. I installed it in seconds. It's fairly inconspicuous, and it works fine with the test button. I gave it four stars because I have only had it a couple of days. I will update if I learn something new."
3,Cheap battery compartment,"Battery door made very cheap. I purchased one locally and the door broke just installing the battery. When I returned it to the store, they told me that they are getting a lot of returns because of the battery door breaking. Bought this on Amazon because it was cheaper and the other brands were more expensive. I figure for the prioe I can just replace the whole unit if it breaks when I replace the battery. Don't know how well it will work if it senses CO though."
1,Not sure if this is working???,"Recently, I had a flood in my basement and ran a propane heater for hours on end. Common sense would tell you that a huge quantity of combustion byproducts would be released. My new alarm just sat there happy as a clam. I am suspicious that it is not functioning properly."
4,Seems to work...hopefully will never have to REALLY know,"Put this thing in the hallway near a wood stove. Using the test features, it's working fine. The red light is glowing, it's plugged in, and there is battery backup in the form of 2 AA batteries that came with it. Can't be too sure if it actually works, since that's not a test I'm willing to partake in. According to the instructions, it says it meets the standards for beeping in the amount of time (based on amount of carbon monoxide in the air), though I would have liked it to say that it's better. Maybe something like ""While national guidelines state the alarm sounds when <whatever>, this alarm will sound immediately upon detection of <some lower threshold.>""You know, better safe than sorry.Overall, I'll keep it until it does its own death, or around 7 years when all carbon monoxide detectors die. Recommended, but not necessarily over any competitors."
1,Needs replacement in 7 months.,"Bought this alarm in spring 2007. Manufacture date printed on back says 2007 Feb 07. Have had two sets of batteries in it in the time we owned it and recently it started beeping three ""chirps"" per minute. Checked the back and that means replace alarm... already?Plugs into the wall, yet will not work without the batteries. Overall pretty disappointed. Previously used a NightHawk carbon monoxide detector. Nearly the same price and nice digital readout. Works off outlet. Unfortunately can't find that quality and price now that CO detectors are required by local code."
5,Months later its still printing things clearly,"Months later its still printing things clearly even when I only use it once a month. I was concerned about it drying up, but that hasn't happened yet."
4,V,I'm not a big Carradine fan but I am a fan of filmmaker Douglas Schulze and this movie was excellent. I loved the three tales told about the same curse over three different centuries. I also loved the actress who played the lead Sasha Higgins. The film has a very creepy vibe and I really like the directors commentary. My only negative comment is with regard to the films title. It was originally called the Rain and that would have been a much better title. COLLIDER.COM really liked the film and gave it an awesome review. That's how I learned about it.
4,A New Level for Indie Horror,"It's a beautifully shot and composed indie horror film which strays from the standard, boring slasher and/or torture porn elements so prevelant in the genre and actually delivers a story! With characters and plot!It is at the end of the day a low budget film so it's not perfect but it's still a lot better than most of the crap released direct to dvd in order to keep a steady stream of new arrivals on the shelves.Best Parts: the cinematography, score, production design and Richard Lynch and Ellen Sandweiss' actingLeast Impressive Parts: Some of the CG effects aren't great, story is kinda slow and some of the other acting is a bit stiffOverall it has some flaws but makes up for them by being a tremendously ambitious and interesting classic style horror film."
4,Dark Fields airing on Showtime,"Dark Fields will soon be airing on SHOWTIME. Critics have given the film great reviews. COLLIDER.COM, SCREENRANT, DVD VERDICT, INSIDE PULSE, VIDEO VAULT are just a few of the sites that are recommending DARK FIELDS. ORDER IT TODAY from AOMAZON.COM and enjoy it. I DID."
1,Stay out of the field.,A horrible waste of time!! I wasted my time don't waste yours! You've been warned!! One of the worst I've ever seen!
1,Pictures are deceiving,Bought this product thinking I was getting 4 gears because of the picture. Only came with one.
4,One of the better Micheaux films,"Pretty good for a Michaux film (in spite of their historical significance, most of them are quite awful). Basically, this is the story of how Edna Mae Harris (who would be remembered by a later generation as the female lead on Pigmeat Markham's comedy records) refusing to prostitute herself at a seedy club and being framed for murder. Decent acting and good story, although the low-budget cinematography will cause some eyestrain. BTW-one of the detectives is played by Robert Jones-father of James Earl."
3,Old DVD Movie,"The quality and content of this DVD was not what I expected, however, I had placed it on the shelf with my old classic DVDs."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I read once that you can either buy a $1200 tripod off the bat or you can buy cheaper tripods and then spend several thousands of dollars before you end up with the $1200 tripod you should have bought in the first place.As a tripod, this does have three legs, but it is not very stable. If I keep it close to the ground it's reasonably stable and useful, but if I have the legs extended it gets wobbly pretty quickly. If I have the arm that holds the camera extended, it's basically useless.This was a replacement for a more expensive tripod that I lost somewhere along the way. Every time I use it, I long for the old one. Save your money and buy something more expensive :)"
3,"Good product,but bad item sent with poor packaging!","I'm giving this product 3 stars since the functionality of this tripod is really good but the item given by amazon is not. When I received the package, I was surprised to see that it is not enclosed in the usual brown box the way Amazon-purchased items that I bought before were packed. The address label is just taped on the product box which looked really old and is damaged though I ordered a new product. Now I'm wondering if I received an old stocked product or a used one. When I opened the box, it was really easy to open, since the other end is not even taped. Not only that, no bubble wrap or any protective cover was used in the package. The tripod looked new except that when I inspected further, I've seen a few scratches on it. I'm really disappointed!"
4,"Product Nice, disappointed with the Seller though","I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and was very disappointed in the fact that it came broken. He loved it and wanted a new ""flipper"" not a whole tripod, (if the flipper was not possible then a replacement) well. They explained they were sorry, but they had no more. I waited the 30 days to return in it hopes that more would come in. I saw that they had a LOT of them up for auction, but nobody responded to help me out.Over all the product was great, but now I have no tripod, no Christmas gift and it's almost February. I don't usually don't have issues with Amazon, but was disappointed this time. I will continue to buy, but not for important occasions."
2,190XPROB Review,I bought this tripod to use with a Kowa TSN-823 spotting scope based on reviews. This tripod is too small to use with a spotting scope. The slightest wind or the slightest movement of the fluid head causes tripod movement that takes too long to settle. Buy a more substantial tripod for use with a scope.
2,Great Product but defective one delivered,"This is a great product. I have used a friends before, but the product I received is a defect. One of the three legs is longer than the others. I send Manfrotto a message and they let me know it is not supposed to be like that."
4,Great Tripod but no Connecting Piece for Camera,"I gave this tripod to my son for Christmas. He is very happy with it. However, it did not come with the adaptor to attach the camera to the top of the tripod. My son needed to purchase this separately. Otherwise, great product."
5,sturdy and well built,"I was confused when i first started looking around for a new tripod. There were so many to choose from, but i knew that i didn't wanna break the bank for a Gitzo. The next obvious choice for me was manfrotto. I'm not a pro, but this tripod gives me sharp pictures at a great price. When i first pulled it out of the box, my first impression was how well built and put together it was. You hold this tripod and it just feels right. The legs are very easy to extend, no screwing and unscrewing parts, just a simple locking switch and you're set. Some may think this tripod is too heavy to carry around for long periods of time, but i'm not going on some safari for three days. I keep it in my truck and when i see something interesting i'll set it up and get my shot. Get it, save yourself some money, and enjoy taking better pictures with this solid tripod."
4,Pretty good for the money,"This is a good tripod. its still a Manfrotto!the only reason I gave it 4 stars its because its a little lighter than expected. but since it fit the budget and the price is really good, I am happy with it.I got it with the Manfrotto 322RC2 Horizontal Grip Action Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate (3157N) and it is a joy to work with.after researching all over the internet and magazines for a good tripod for that price range, this is the best one."
5,"Excellent craftsmanship, very practical","I have owned several tripods over the years, including a larger Bogen, but this is really the best I've ever bought. Not too heavy, sets up quickly and has a lot of versatility, also for low the ground macro work. Highly recommended."
4,Cheaper Manfrotto for DSLR's and Best too !,"I wanted a decently affordable tripod with good stability, less weight and I was definitely sure that I wanted a ""Manfrotto"". After lot of research, visits to many local camera stores and playing around with several pieces i found this one meeting my needs. Light weight (around 4 pounds) & pretty good stable for my Rebel Xti with 70-200 mm on it.Maximum load (11 lbs). One thing i didn't like is the leg locking mechanism. Sometimes it is hard to open the lock. I loved the 360 degree movement of the middle leg, when combined with Manfrotto 322RC2 it works like a charm. I highly recommend this product who is looking for a affordable Manfrotto with good durablity."
2,Well I HAD liked it....,"For about two years I had really liked this tripod. Now, I plan to sell it after I fix it.Its rated for 11 lbs??? I just broke two leg angle locks, these are cheap castings and should be machined aluminum, and I am not even sure how they broke. Either me wiggling it in some slush with my weak right hand did it, or else putting my 5 lb view camera on it. Nice that it didn't drop the camera, but that was only because of the rocky bottom of the creek bed holding the legs in place. To be clear, my 2 lbs Feisol has handled my cameras better and my right wrist is so weak I won't even lift a gallon jug with it... how could I possibly have broken TWO of these cheap castings at once without abusing it?I really like the older Bogen tripods. The new stuff just is not built as well. I've had a couple of grand of gear on this thing... I can't do that again, I got lucky that I didn't loose a camera today."
2,Bogen Manfrotto 190XPROB,"A usable unit except that the stem clamping arrangement is poorly designed. The thumbscrew knob will, after some use, strip its threads rendering the whole tripod useless as the stem will no longer stay in place at any level. In tightening the thumbscrew to hold my camera in the position I wanted the threads eventually stripped in the soft metal and the vertical adjustments were no more."
5,intellectual fun,"If you had to go through it in graduate school you'd probably agree with me that behaviour under uncertainty is usually handled rather mechanically by professors. You may even have considered that, anyway, not much intuition could be behind those theories. Ivar Ekeland shows in this book that dealing with the fundamentals of expectations, probabilities, games, and risk can be fun, and you get the intuition to start thinking by yourself as well. Early morning reading, though."
3,Elegant prose covers lack of novel insight,"As an aficionado of Norse sagas, I was intrigued to find that a mathematician wrote a book on probability framed by Saint Olaf's saga. Six essays on popular science topics, with clear explanations and interestingly non-standard historical and literary detours. But the choice of math topics (random number generators vs true randomness vs Kolmogorov complexity; random strategies in game theory; chaos, attractors, fractals and ergodicity; risk aversion and underestimation of rare serious events) seems in 2008 very unimaginative, and despite its colorful background the book brings no new insight or individualistic perspective to the science."
3,Historical Romance,"Outside of my preferred time period, several scenes I enjoyed especially the bridegroom being escorted by the bridesmaids into church but I gave up part way through. You may enjoy it.From the back of the Ulverscroft large print edition...In the year 1594, Bernard Kettering, a Member of Parliament and a Justice of the Peace, was growing tired of the capricious ways of his ward, John Harcourt. At the age of six, John had become the fifteenth Baron Harcourt de Laleham, under the joint guardianship of his mother and Bernard, his second cousin. John grew up spoilt and indulged by his mother, and after her death Bernard decided to bring his nineteen-year-old ward into line. When John falls in love with Tamsin, an illegitimate girl from a notorious family, Bernard is livid - and the affair is doomed..."
1,Turista drivel. The San Fermines are so much more.,"Stupid turistas from all over the world get drunk and act stupid at the San Fermin Festival. A ridiculous chapter wasted on an interview of a local pamplonense whose claim to fame was having been a pickpocket when he was younger. If you want to see the best coverage of the encierro and the festival highlights, go to TV Espanola Internacional on cable TV or on demand on the Internet. Don't waste your money on this amateurish garbage."
1,Borrowed ideas,Not quite what I have expected. She should stick to what she writes best - all about superstitions and buying feng shui stuffs. Classical feng shui are for the classical feng shui writers. Would rather read Eva Wong's books. I think she got most of the originals from other classical feng shui writers. It's disgraceful!
4,great for 8 or so hours,"Was taking APS with white willow bark, worked all day. Stress J works half the time but worth a couple hours focus on the day"
1,horrible,"got it as a gift for someone, pencil tips came broken, the mesh holding the sketch pad seems to be very cheap looking, and it snags the sketch pad each time you try and put it back in bending the corners back. I was expecting a little more from this to be honest, at least a decent sketch pad holder!"
5,great product!,Bought this for a daughter's friend who loves to sketch for Christmas. She really liked it and she has a couple of others that she'd gotten from other people. She liked the set up of this one much better!
4,"1/2"" R/C protective foam rubber","Product is as advertised and arrived on time. High density foam. I could have used thicker 1"" less dense for my project but this did the job. A little on expensive side for small piece of foam."
2,Case Studies can be missleading,Our class worked with this book using the case studies as homework assignments; too many cases in which we all completely disagreed with the textbook author's answers.
1,Clinical Assessment Workbook,"I used this book during my graduate studies at UT Austin, this book is completely worthless without the key book. I is only a workbook. I cannot understand why they are selling it so expensive if there is no answer book along with it. I have this book and can't use it, you will just be guessing. They should also sell the key book."
2,Good workbook but MISSING PAGES!!,"I bought this book brand new for a graduate school course that I'm taking.... I was enjoying the book until I realized that I can't do one of the assignments because it's missing pages!! It doesn't look as though it's missing pages, but it is. It skips from page 214 (case 8.1# to page 247 #case 10.2) which presents a problem since I need to complete case 9.2 for class. It's a good book... just check it out when you receive it to make sure you got the whole book. Wondering if there was just a printing error in my batch?"
4,QUESTION please,"I bought this book to play some songs on my flute, which I understood to be a ""C"" instrument. When I received it, it's great but the octaves seem too low for a flute. Were these books designed for piano only? I would appreciate knowing. I also bought a B flat one for my tenor sax and it also has very low notes for songs on a sax. Thanks!"
5,Impressed,"This book is so big that half of it is the table of contents! Just kidding. It is a pretty big spiral bound book with 600 songs though. This has a ton of great songs. I don't think the print is too small. I am able to read it off of the music stand in good lighting with no problem. I like how they have it categorized in the front; first all of the titles listed alphabetically, then categorized by artist, and then chronologically. Some of the artists where they have a bunch of songs by are: beach boys, phil collins, stevie wonder, elton, elvis, carpenters, mariah...just to name a few. The Great American Songbook!"
5,This Book Rocks,This book is one of the best ones I have ever purchased as it has a lot of songs not found in other books like these. I play it everyday I ge the chance to.
3,a good book for brief theorotical overview,"this is an excellent book for someone who wants to practically work on some basic digital circuits.this book provides good reading for practical applications and also provides a brief run through of the theorotical knowledge required for a particular circuit.it includes chapters on boolean algebra,combinational and sequential logic circuits and families and chapters on flip flops,counters and registers.however this book is certainly not meant for someone who is looking for some theorotical depth in the subject."
3,"James Boughton's book; Bouton--Boughton Family: Descendants of John Boution, a Native of France, Who Embarked from Gravesend, En","As a one of thousands of descendants of John Bouton [Boughton], I purchasedthis book to help with my family research. There should be a warning with this ""reference"", so here it is. There is little truth at all to the early information. The French Count Nicholas, etc. is contrived fable. A lot of the later chapters are based on vital records extracted from local or church records and are valuable or can be used to search for documentation. The format is also a trifle difficult to navigate."
3,Review of the Bouton/Boughton genealogy,"I received the book and it has a number of pages that did not come out- they were smeared in the xeroxing process and are throughout the book. Who ever was in charge of quality control was not doing their job. Otherwise the book is a good resource for doing genealogy on the Bouton/Boughton family knowing that the limitations of this book with regard to the errors in James Boughton's book, first published in 1890. As many know in doing research on the Bowton history John Bowton was not of French descent let alone the son of a Count. After the first 6 generations I was comfortable using the book with general information. I found some contradictory information regarding places where my ancestors lived, confusion of counties, cities and even some dates. Still it is a valuable resource."
4,Great source of information,To anyone who has a child with autism this is a book to read. Lots of ways to view how to better educate your child. It's worth buy it!
3,Crime as performance art,"The cinematic beauty of the early apocalyptic books has been replaced by a stripped down, suburban set of tennis courts, retirement homes, and fancy boats. The locals are bored into a catatonic slumber which can only be awakened by crime, violence and perversion. The delinquent instigators use communal participation as a way of bonding the spectators into a mass ritual of performace art where crime is the main event. Ballard fans will find the familiar themes of deviancy, crowd control, and city anarchy. Judged on these merits the book is a solid addition to his works. The weaknes lies in the narrator's too predictable behavior and his fall into temptations that are by ballard's own fictional standards rather tame. For sheer outrageousness, it is hard to top the deviancy and perversity of CRASH."
4,Vintage Ballard psych-noir,"""Cocaine Nights"" is a return to Ballard's psychological preoccupations. We're ushered into the quintessential Ballardian scenario: the microcosmic ""culture"" of the wealthy and retired. We quickly learn that all is not well, and follow the quasi-hard-boiled narrator as he succumbs to the community's visceral core. Bloody and provocative, ""Cocaine Nights"" is an excellent compliment to Ballard's other ""landscape"" novels (""Crash,"" ""High-Rise,"" ""Concrete Island""), in which he plumbs the apocalyptic interface between desire and environment, turning the psyche inside-out with the steely objectivity of a lab tech. ""Cocaine Nights"" is vintage Ballard psych-noir and won't disappoint."
3,Sun Baked,"Ballard's attempt to ""expose"" the seedy underbelly of English retirement communities under the guise of mystery ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise. The beginning, with whispered conspiracies and country club cliques, sets the stage for a scandal-laced, brutally honest look at leisure society and its inability and unwillingness to think outside the box without prompting. Unfortunately, the characters are ultimately shallow, the situations familiar (cocaine in discotheques, oh my), and, the mark of death for any mystery, predictable. The prose and Ballard's ability to breathe life into the strangest and far fetched situation shines through as usual, but this neither ranks as a good mystery, nor as good Ballard."
2,Club class? More like cruise control...,"Not a bad story, with the usual Ballardian ideas. But that is the problem: J.G. Ballard is getting lazy. Okay, so exposing the tedium, the superficiality, the pointlessness of bourgeouis life is the point of his writing (isn't it?)... but Ballard's books are getting more and more similar. This is just Vermillion Sands but less fantastic, Running Wild running on empty (and much less economical and experimental in form). All Ballard's characters, from The Drowned World to Cocaine Nights, are like millenial parodies of people out of a Noel Cowerd play - 'how frightfully dreadful, and pass me another cocktail, darling...'. Ballard is probably right ot say that unfortunately this homogenous, leisured, airport lounge, gated-communities culture is the future in a globalized, Americanized world, but surely there are different ways of approching it than to write the same thing, in the same way, over and over again?"
3,Disappointing,"I just could not accept the premise that crime is necessary for civic responsibilty and artistic endeavour. To quote the medicis and the Renaissance is not proof; there were many external threats and civic collectivism was no where in sight. having said that, i enjoyed his descriptions of the Costa del Sol which hold good even today."
3,I'm ok it's ok,"My major complaint is with the location. Mr. Ballard, it would be Estrella del Mar not Estrella De Mar. You forgat the article bro. It's ok. really. You'll like Bobby Crawford, the type of guy you really want to hate but can't help loving. The provocative title might sell some copies but its not really honest. Don't expect Hurly-Burly. I'm a big fan of Ballard's other work esp. sci-fi stuff so I give him props for attempting to follow the formula of the detective novel. The problem is, as a detective novel it doesn't really work. As a decent narrative and escapism its ok."
3,Hugely over rated.,"The most exciting part of this book was the cover, with its imaginative use of a line of coke spattered across a reflective metal surface, set over a background thermal image.What this story lacked was drive, something that should have been, since this is a first person, present tense narrative. Ballard is supposed to be avant-garde, but comes across like a so, so Agatha Christie. And Will Self, The Observer contributor, who grandly states that Ballard's writing `knocks the work of other avant-garde writers work into a hatted cock', should know better. Then again, probably not from what I've read of his.Now if only Iain Banks had written this book, then you'd have been treated to some real avant-garde writing. Go read Complicity, and you'll see what I mean."
1,It didn't work for me,"Very disappointing, especially after the rave reviews on the back cover. The book is little more than a vehicle for Ballard's much aired views on suburban alienation. These views are done to death in this book. The dialogue is absurd, the plot is risible, the characters cardboard and the prose style is tired. I don't recommend it."
1,Oh Dear!,"I know I can blame nobody but myself, but I was taken in by the interesting title and the reviews on the back: 'One of the few world-class British writers alive today. This is club class Ballard. You really have to buy it.' Let me tell you, you don't. The 'plot' was completely ridiculous and far-fetched - people are bored so let's set their houses on fire and steal their possessions, then they'll all want to star in porn films and play tennis! Hmmm, logical eh? Not only that, but the dialogue was appalling - I'm yet to meet anyone who talks like the characters in this book, and if I did I would probably tell them to shut up immediately.The back cover also tells me that this was shortlisted for the 1996 Whitbread Novel Award. I can only assume that my book had the wrong cover.This is my first (and last) Ballard novel and I could list you a great many better British writers than him. Save your money. (It gets one star for the reflective cover)."
2,Big Bust,"If I could have i would have given this video a 1 and a half , i was very disapionted in a 2 and a half hour video there is only 2 good matches the first one is macho man vs. jake the snake , in 1992 jake had a cobra bite macho man they said it was not devenomized ''DEVONOMIZED'' ya right anyway the second match was Taker (champ) vs. Hogan of course hogan wins , he had to or all the little kids would cry , it was part of that goodie to-shoo era. If ur going to get this just get it for ur collection!!! i thought it would be a lot better than this!!!!!!!!!!"
4,bought for my tokina 11-16 lens,"this was the cheapest i could find for lens size i was looking for, works great doesnt fall off like my tokina lens cap did"
5,Good!,Bought this lens cap because of the center pinch mechanism (I have a len hood). Good quality and snap right in. Will recommend this for anyone.
4,works,I was looking for a quality accurate tire gauge. I bought this one based on many positive reviews. It has worked well and accurately. However it does not provide means to deflate a tire.
4,Simple and accurate,"My wife was having a hard time reading a manual tire guage, so I added this to a recent order. The instructions are a quick and easy read (maybe a minute or two to get the gist). We've both had a chance to use this and it works as promised. The only downside so far is that it feels cheap. However, it was cheap - and for a product that will be used irregularly it will do just fine."
5,Feeding Your Soul:A Quiet Time Handbook,"Like a gift from the Father, this book came to me at a dry spiritual time. As I read the first sentence I knew that it was written in such a way as to be applied and used right away. Didn't have to read the book in entirety to begin restructuring my quiet time with God. It is a handbook easy to understand and follow. I know that the author has met with the Master and does so regularly. Thank you Mrs. Fleming."
1,Dont buy this,"Ummm, i might have read the description of this cover faceplate, but its not an actual faceplate, its a sticker. and it dont fit correctly. i tried to put the stupid sticker on and it was not good. I actually threw it away immediately! Man, why a stinkin sticker?"
5,Amazing,"A friend showed me this anime, we watched the first episode together on netflix, I was blown away by this anime. Absolutely amazing, and so disappointed there is not a second season. A must have, delightfully disturbing and with just the right amount of comic relief. I will watch again and again."
3,Fantastic if you're a fan of the brutally twisted.,"First off, I watched this anime about 2 years ago, and in one scene of it the main character has a puppy who was beaten to death by her elementary school classmates. There are parts of this anime that are extremely haunting and rather disturbing, but this is just my personal opinion. Just be prepared when you watch it, and I'd also recommend not watching it around children. That being said, it's graphic, but not comically graphic (more along the feel of sin city rather than kill bill) the drawing is nice and smooth. Although it did seem to me like some parts of it they were focusing making it more and more twisted rather than character development, but it could be that it was hard for me to focus on the character development with everything else going on."
3,"A review more of the edition, not the series.","Hey all. I bought this edition recently, and was pretty disappointed with the packaging. The outside box is sturdy enough, but the inside discs are all kept on one spindle, rather than in separate cases or separate disc holders. While this isn't definitely going to mess the discs up, I believe it does increase the possibility of damage happening. If this type of packaging bothers you, then I'd suggest going with one of the previous editions."
3,Check youtube first.,This series is a hit and miss. I liked it but didnt. Im not disappointed that I watched it. -Jult Warfell
1,Anime for shallow chuummmm...ps!,"Yeah yeah yeah, I heard it all. The majority claims this tripe is good because alot of people like it. Well alot of people love driving drunk but it doesn't mean its good. And Elfen Peed is the definition of very bad anime. Cliche ridden and beyond stupid characters. Plus it simply don't know what it wants to be. is it comedy, is it horror who the hell knows? People claim the naysayers simply don't get it. But I read some of the discussions going on for months. And I think the fans are simply fooled by the smoke and mirrors, plus they have poor debating skills too. You guys are the ones who don't get it. If you dig this and consider it a masterpiece. Then you don't know what a masterpiece is. Millenium Actress, Samurai X, Nausicaa, Grave of the fireflies Now that's what I call some masterpiece there."
5,An Amazing ADULT series!,"This series writing,storyline and animation are all amazing. although this serious contains allot of nudity and obscenity It is done so in a brilliant manor. I highly recommend this series it sucks you into the story instantly! however The plot is extremely adult orientated so this is far too intense for children. The manga continues after the end of the series so hopefully there will be a continuation but if not i recommend picking up the manga after watching this series. (Animea.net it will answer any questions you may have) Definitely get this series(The box is ok but the disks are all stacked ontop of eachother which dosnt help protect them) with that aside i say but this series its worth it! This series pushed a lot of boundaries but is phenomenal I recommend reading the manga where this series ends"
1,Can we say sucks?,"I bought this last year with my birthday money, WHAT A MISTAKE!! The bateries rarley last more than 10 minutes due to the large screen. Will die with the lens out. Pictures rarley come out clear. I want to sell it so bad. I hate it!"
4,It isa key issue in the spiritual dynamics of some churches.,"This book covers a very particular issue that I have witnessed and experienced first-hand in congregations. It is frightening that these dynamics actually exist. It seems incredible that they happen again and again. I only wonder what to do after one has been killed. Would appreciate a follow-up or a ""Dead Pastors' Society"" with whom to associate."
1,Don't But It!,"This book was quite popular fro several years. I now see it presented as what not to do. Following its advice can lead to disaster. May I suggest instead you check out the book ""Never Call Them Jerks;"" a book about difficult people from the point of view of family system theory."
3,Reprinted newspaper Q&A's on canon law.,"A small reprinting of some canon law questions-and-answers which were penned for Catholic newspapers in the early 1980s. Neither a code nor a commentary, the materials tried to respond briefly (sometimes, extremely briefly) to a few of the more common questions about Church law being floated in Catholic circles at the time. Some pretty famous canon lawyers contributed to the project, but unless one's current questions coincide exactly with a given question in the book, there is not much point in consulting it anymore."
4,a moving protrait of a place close to a civil war,"However confusing the backwards order of the movie's 3 parts may be, images and story itself remains deeply moving. An intense portrait of the senseless war on the balcans, where neighbors turn against neighbors and school friends are not able to see each other anymore. Anger and hate makes normal people to murderers. ""An eye for an eye..."" ?, but the response ""turn the other cheek"" vanishes in the chaos of the moment."
5,A modern masterpiece on ancient Macedonian foundations,"These compositions are a brilliant modern showcase of traditional Macedonian music, combining stylistic, rhythmic and melodic influences from Macedonia's rich culture (which has been developing since several hundred years before Christ) with modern compositional insight, including brilliant arrangements.Anastasia is one of Macedonia's most professional, cohesive, progressive and most talented bands in a while (along with 'Synthesis,' who are probably even better).Outstanding musicianship with FEEL most bands can only dream of.This should be in every serious music fan's collection.There are only about four albums around of this style and magnitude, including two from Anastasia (this and 'Melourgia') and two from DD Synthesis (a self-titled album and 'Swinging Macedonia,' which IMHO is the best)."
5,An outstanding example of Balkan culture,"I watched the movie with a couple of friends here in Texas, from both Macedonia and Bulgaria. Then I got the CD and have been listening to it for more than a week now. It feels like a drug, you cannot live without it. An exceptional work of real folklore music from the Balkans, a little bit modernized to only improve the impression, this music makes me feel like home wherever I go. Get this CD to experience the unbelievable depth of emotions of the ancient Balkan culture."
4,Remastered But Not Perfect.,"I've bought both the movie and soundtrack. I recently bought the soundtrack again is it's remastered version because the origional one was very poor. The remastered still leaves a lot to be desired I believe because when it was origionally recorded, it was intended to give it a bit of aa disco beat. The selections of course are very good. 'Evergreen' is a standard and you would probably enjou 'Man in the Moon'. A must have for Barbra and Kris fans."
5,Barbra's Best Album,"I love this soundtrack,even though its very hard to take Kristofferson's singing.Even he has to close his eyes from the pain,but his acting was great in the movie.Elvis was suppose to play his part,but Barbra couldn't come up with the Million bucks C.Parker wanted. What a great album and movie this would have been if she paid,and Elvis might still be alive. All of Barbra songs are the best,and she wrote two of them ,and won a Oscar for,""Evergreen""along with Paul Williams. I played this album to death,and especially love the last songs,""With one more look at you/Watch Closely Now."" Along with ""Guilty,"" this is by far Barbra's best."
4,what a star,This was a movie when I was a teenager that I loved and this sound track made me really like Barbra Streisand
5,A Star Is Born (1976 Film),its great just what I had remembered. deliver was prompt and cd was in excellent condition
3,Streisand's 'Star' for sure,"This largely forgettable cd from the mostly forgettable film is soley redeemed by a singular track: ""Finale - With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now"" (track 10). Streisand is peerless in her vocal rendition of the haunting medley penned with gorgeous lyrics by Paul Williams. Rarely, if ever, has La Babs bared her heart and soul as rawly as she does here. Her segue into ""Watch Closely Now"" is simply chilling in its immediacy and earnestness; she demands to be heard. Whether she is acting while singing, channeling Joplin and Garland, or merely revealing years of angst and hurt, she is a blistering force here. The arrangement is likewise an emotional piece of musicianship and combined with ""that voice"" creates a thrilling listening experience. That she has completely ignored this amazing piece of work in post ""Star"" concerts and recordings remains a mystery. Kudos for the back cover photo."
3,Barbra!,"'Tis true that this monsterous remake of a classic takes the biscuit. Tis true that it's set in the rock world , but the kind of rock these people peddle is the softest thing next to jelly. But the biggest embarrassment has to be when Streisand gets to shake her loins in rhythm...Kristofferson is much better is the fading drunkard. Only buy this C.D if you want a reminder that Barbra is better as a diva and Kris is better as a country and western singer..."
2,A Star Is Born soundtrack CD,"I received this CD in good condition and in a timely manner. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the remake of this album which I had when it originally came out."
3,The Worst of Steisand,"Boring, boring, boring. I don't like Streisand that much, but she did some nice comedies (notably ""What's Up Doc?"") and some of her albums are pretty good. I recommend ""Memories"", which has a lot of good songs on it. Never saw this movie and after listening to the soundtrack I am glad I didn't. The only redeeming quality to this album is that Sreisand does a decent job on some of the songs. Kristoferson is terrible on this album; I am sure he isn't usually as bad as he sounds here, but I have never been a fan of his, so I don't have any of his albums to compare with. If you want a complete Streisand collection or if you loved the movie, you might want to get this; otherwise I would pass it up."
1,Hilarious swill from her all-time worst movie,"Or, as TIME Magazine so succinctly put it back in 1976, ""Kate Smith conquers Woodstock."" Awful songs from an equally bad flick. Kristofferson is at least unintelligible, so at least you're spared listening to the actual lyrics in HIS songs."
2,"Book without cover, plain and boring...Cover, like CLOTHING, matters too!!!! Boo on this buy.","Glorious depth and inside stories, just NOT a cover, as the photo shows. A book is not only valuable for the information, but also for the outside cover, as shown in all photos...shame, for not saying so before I ordered. Very disappointed and would NOT have bought without cover if buying ""in person"" in a store. I love holding and touching and viewing a book as a work of art, inside and out. I feel like it is ""NAKED"" and missing something very important. It is an odd size, so buying a zip up or book cover for the OUTSIDE covering will not work. Boo on this buy, not saying NO COVER or I definitely would not have bought it.lesson learned...see first in peson, before buying.."
4,foot notes r great!,i can pretty much read all the foot notes and not even need to read the bible itself and understand. they really do help! just the darn pages r so thin..... not good for highlighting at all
2,HA!,"This is a great work of fiction, however it goes on and on in 5th century righting boredom. It is also quite disturbing that people find this fiction to be true."
2,The second edition is much better for commentary,"This Third Edition has a superior print type set and is more appealing to the eyes.The text is still the NRSV, which overall is an excellent translation, with the exception of some inappropriate inclusive language, eg. Proverbs 30:4, which refers directly to a father/son relationship, not parent/child. This rendering totally obfuscates the allusion to the Messiah. Anyway...The Second Edition is the one to get if you have any respect for the sacred text. Dr. Metzger was the editor and it has balanced commentary. At least the Second Edition acknowledges in 1 Cor 6:9 that the term ""sodomite"" refers to a male homosexual. The Third Edition tries to explain away any reference to homosexuality!!? How PC can you get? I want commentary that respects history and the Biblical Author. I can get PC mush on TV all day long.The only reason the Third Edition gets any stars is for production quality and use of the NRSV."
5,Incredibly beautiful Bible,"I have this Bible, myself, and I got it as a gift for a friend who was leaving our choir for another job out of town. She was delighted with the Bible, too, as I had been. It makes a beautiful presentation with the gold edged pages and burgundy leather exterior. I had my choir friends sign it near the presentation page, and that made it even more special; when she reads it, she will think of us. The price was very reasonable, compared to other sources."
2,Pass this up,"Look at other study Bibles like the Concordia Self-Study Bible, before you get this one. It is very limited in notes and is not a study bible at all. I own one and with so many other better choices out there I cannot understand why anyone would bother with this."
5,NRSV Annotated: Brief Comment,"I bought this Bible, along with the Oxford Bible Commentary, because of classes I am taking. I am pleased for both. The NRSV is a good translation, despite the gender nuetral language, which reads well and has the best type face for reading. It is a complete Bible in that it includes, like the RSV Annotated Bible, the entire canon of Scripture approved by Catholic, Ortrhodox, and Protestant churches. However, unlike the RSV, this translation is not approved for liturgical use by the Catholic and Orthodox churches because of the gender nueter language- though it is approved for personal use for Catholics. The Orthodox allows it for neither. So the NRSV is only ecumenical in breadth of canon, not in use. The RSV remains the only true ecumenical translation for worship and personal study."
4,"""Excellent, But Could Be Smaller""","The NOAB third edition has been a good scholarly resource to research and personal study. The annotation on the Bible verses and the introductory information of each Bible book are well written with good scholarship. Maps are clearly printed and location are well indicated. Concordance is catered to the needs of the reader, and only if more details are required, a comprehensive concordance may be used. The fonts are excellent for reading. Generally, the NOAB third edition is an indispensable resource for scholars, professors, and pastors. The only discrepancy of this Bible is that it is a hugh material to carry around. It would be perfected by having the size trim to the size of NIV Study Bible Personal Size. Otherwise, it is a perfect resource for serious biblical study."
1,Good at providing a single point of view,"This is a good commentary for learning what very liberal bible scholars believe. It is, however, very bad for getting a balanced look at the moderate, conservative, and liberal academic positions.This is a very liberal publication. Don't count on the moderate and traditional views being portrayed accurately or in any good light (if they are portrayed at all).I think that many of the ideas advocated in the commentary are unsubstantiated and often remarkably far-fetched. Sometimes the positions offered have been shown to be false more than twenty-five years ago! This is why I give it a 1 out of 5.I recommend the purchase of the Navarre Bible (a commentary series). There you will find balanced, sensible, in-depth, and up-to-date commentary. It uses the more universally accepted RSVCE."
2,Lots of info but most Christians need not apply,"There's lots of historical info here, true. Some good outlines of the backgrounds of the books of the Bible and some nice essays at the end. The Protestant canon of the OT is supplemented by the Catholic and Orthodox Deuterocanonicals.The problem? This ""bible"" is loaded with unbelief. To a man, the ""scholars"" involved come from a radical theological background. They pretty much seem to doubt that any of the Biblical books were written by who they claimed to be. They attack the Bible's clear teaching on moral issues (e.g. homosexuality) and then try to explain them away with equivocation that would make Bill Clinton say ""Enough!"". Since the notes attack the ideas of inerrancy and infallibility left and right, most will be offensive for anyone from an Evangelical, Fundamental, or Traditional Catholic/Orthodox background; therefore, most of the Christian world will have little use for it."
3,The Human Show,"The first chapter of this book describes the creation of a world in which all of the subsequent action takes place. The world in question is flat and covered with a dome that has little stars painted on it. Just for fun the stars are organized into constellations. The guy who built the world lives on top of the dome and controls the weather, occasionally pouring water through little holes that he made. When he gets angry he pours a lot of water, which spells big trouble for the people who live down below. The guy who lives on top of the dome also created a sun, which orbits his planet and may or may not be attached to the dome. The remainder of the book deals with the exploits of the characters who live in the dome. Some of the exploits are quite interesting, but popular confusion between the world described in this book and Earth continues to be a major barrier to human progress."
4,Surprised Customer,"Great Bible - purchased for class but was pleasantly surprised by the large font type and great resources in the back(i.e. essays, maps, etc). It's very hard to find a NRSV Bible with large print and leather bound."
5,Great study Bible,this is the perfect bible for anyone who is looking to go beyond just regular study and learn about the Bible in its historical context. The notes are very insightful and there is ample room in the margin for making one's own notes. The only problem I have with it is that it is huge. I guess it needs to be to fit all the great information that is provided.
5,The Perfect Touch!,I love these magnets! They add a colorful touch to my 2008 Harvest Moon Beige Volkswagen Beetle! I get alot of compliements on them!
5,"Beautiful, informative book- recommended","The information about shade/sun, growth, size, color, and so on is all there for each plant in an easy-to-read style, but the extra bit that sold me on this book is the plant's use by wildlife. It's specific to bird and animal, such as hummingbirds, mice, deer, song birds, or shelter for lizards. The descriptive paragraphs under each plant are very helpful, with the author's experience and opinion. And of course, the photographs are gorgeous and show the plants in an appropriate environment. I highly recommend this book."
3,a nice little compilation,"First off,this isn`t a live recording,it`s a compilation that has a couple live tracks. I don`t know the origin of all the tracks but most of them are from their Columbia recordings and all of them sound to be from the early part of their carreer and the Sony Best Of collectioon has better sound quality. Taking all the previous into account this is still a great disc, though far from great packaging. The band pours through all their usual tricks, mixing styles from traditional latin sounds to funk infused fussion."
5,"""Expertly and idiomatically played.""","""These splendid performances are enhanced by expert balancing and a lovely, warm sound. If Marais is in need of fresh impetus I can't imagine more persuasive advocates than he has here, for this is one of the best Centaur discs I've heard. Strongly recommended.""Fanfare Magazine"
3,Handy but doesn't hold much,I bought this to try and rein in the plastic bag overflow situation going on in our kitchen. This is a good idea but I really wish it held more bags. You can stuff maybe 20 plastic bags in here if you're lucky. I save all plastic bags to use for cleaning the catbox. Trying to cram bags into this thing or get them out is a pain. I guess if you're a minimalist it might work for you but most minimalists I know don't save used plastic bags.
3,Not as simple as you'd think,"I do like that this product keeps the bags out of sight and in a compact area, but the sticky parts on the back don't really work, so keep in mind you'll definitely have to screw it into a wall to make it stay up.Second, if you fill it with bags, it can be quite difficult to get one out.Overall, I like it but a few things could be improved."
1,Poor design,"Horrible. This thing falls off the wall constantly, it is hard to stuff bags in and hard to get them out. NO WAY does it hold the amount of bags it says.... after 20 they are in there so tight the thing just flings off the wall from all your PULLING. Plus, you have to hold it down with the other hand which just gets finger prints all over it. I am going to buy one of those simple fabric holders my mom used to have. Those held a ton of bags and it was easy to work it. Just hang the tube from a hook, simple. Save your time and money on this one....unless you are only looking for the ""Bling bling"" and could care less about it actually holding bags that you are going to need in the future. Oh yeah, I tried the sticky tape vs the screws and it pulled the paint off my pantry door. Nice! Thanks a lot Simplehuman!"
2,Not made like they used to be,"I bought 3 of these for gifts for my daughter, aged 7 and 2 granddaughters, aged 3&4. Everyone of them stopped working in less than 3 months. And, these things aren't cheap anymore, just cheaply made!"
4,Exactly what it says it is.,"Bought this for my 4 year old because he really wanted one. I bought the small one because I thought the large one would be too big for his lap. He played with it for ten minutes, now it's in the toy box. The toy is exactly as described."
1,This toy barely works.,"This etch-a sketch appeared to be similar to the one of my youth. The toy can not draw a picture. The nobs barely move to create lines, so that the picture as shown on the object could never be made with this toy. The grains simply become a dark gray shower across the board and nothing else. The toy was very disappointing. Since it was a gift for my grandson, it was difficult to take this toy and return it. I would not suggest purchasing it."
