3,Teachings of the Tao,Some of the information in the book I already read. Still I found the book to be helpful to me.
2,matalo !,One of the most unusual and brilliant italian I have ever seen. The final with the boomerang has clearly inspired George miller for The Road warrior / Mad Max 2.
4,very nice,"This sword is something you really have to consider buying. The sword is a nice piece to look at and it's very durable(not a toy and very capable of doing damage). The straps on the sheeth can come off but i think it was made like that.If you want it to stay, put a safety pin to hold it.I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because the sword and sheeth are excelant but not perfect. but what is"
3,Not an application development reference,It is an excellent book to introducing object oriented database and the capabilities of Jasmine. Most of the material is conceptual and general. It is not enough for application developers.
2,"Nice pictures, very badly written","Pictures are mostly from Christie's catalogs (and credited as such). Particularly disappointing aspect is that the SAME pictures are used two and three times throughout the book. There's less here than meets the eye. Also missing is any practical information on the pieces shown. Missing are: size of the object; medium (Oil? Tempera? Lacquer? You don't know); history; when sold... What IS written is exceptionally superficial and in some cases downright erroneous. So if you want a book with just nice pictures: buy this. If you want information, find another book."
5,The best,"Take off your shoes on this one. This is NOT a quick read, nor will you finda deeper read than this author. This IS what Theology is all about! Immerse yourselfin this one!John G."
1,Lighthouse,"This product was misrepresented. The songs listed on the CD jacket are not the songs on the CD. The item was advertised as having 12 songs and it only has 11. For example, Pretty Lady is listed as being on the CD and it is not. I have tried contacting the seller with no response."
2,Review of the mid 70's vinyl LP with Roger Dean cover,"The performances here are terrific - Lighthouse was one of Canada's premier rock bands of the late 60's/early 70's. At their peak, their material was as strong as Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears, their jazz/rock contemporaries.This release is the mid 70's GRT vinyl LP and the sound quality is quite poor, thus my low rating. 10 solid song selections but 40% of the tracks are from ""Lighthouse Live"" and while excellent 'live' versions, the sound quality is even worse than the studio tracks included.You can do better than this with other, more recent Lighthouse compilations, mainly on cd (2009, 2010) and this great band deserves the longer track listing and remastered sound they provide. However, the cover is very cool and taken from ""an original illustration by Roger Dean"". Otherwise, search elsewhere for a recording to enjoy this classic Canadian horn/string enhanced rock band."
3,"A ""curious"" quest...","I was just ""curious"" & waking up my memory post-stroke. Wasn't a ""big fan"" or anything. I just like lighthouses after my stroke & wanted to know (& hear"" a bit more to ""wake up memory"" a bot more. It does. Enjoy!"
2,Actual size is more like 14 x 10 x 3,"Actual size, stretching and measuring as generously as possible, is 13.75 x 10.25 x 2.75.Also, you probably already figured this out, but it's a cosmetic tote, not a ""briefcase"". Handles are made of webbing.Still, if you want a cosmetic tote with those measurements, it's serviceable. Or at least mine seems to be, although the zipper split open on first examination. It appears to be just because the zipper's bottom slipped out of its stitching, so a couple of stitches will fix it.Other than that, it appears cheap but serviceable. It's lower quality than the average cosmetic tote from the drugstore (thinner plastic, iffy stitching) but it's a bit bigger. I do wonder why a line of stitching was added across the bottom in the middle of a single sheet of plastic...it doesn't seem to serve any purpose, and it introduces a line of holes which I suspect will wind up being the first failure point (not counting the zipper)."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","The vinyl is very flimsy and the stitching was loose. Very poor quality. Do not waste your money on this product. I thought about returning it, but I didn't want to spend more money, and I certainly didn't want the frustration of dealing with a company that would sell such inferior products in the first place."
1,Flimsy junk!,I was verrrrry disappointed with the quality of this item. The picture gives a TOTALLY different representation of this item. Too costly to return. BUYER BEWARE
5,Clear totes briefcase,"I ordered ten of these totes to make take home literacy bags for my elementary classroom. I love them! I like the clear totes. I put a label in the zipper compartment so that the title can be read from the outside telling what the bag is about. So far, I have made a Lincoln/Washington bag, Tooth bag, rainforest bag, birthday bag, frog bag, zoo animals bag, pets bag, and princess bag.I put 4 or 5 picture books in each with a listing inside about the contents so that my students can take them home and read with family. I am so happy with these! I can't wait to send them home. I am ordering ten more to make more literacy bags. I can change books as the children read at different levels. They are medium weight and can fit inside a child's bookbag to take home or be carried with handle."
4,WONDERFUL & LIGHTWEIGHT!,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON (6YRS) TO HAUL BOOKS, COLORING BOOKS AND CRAYONS AND IT HOLDS UP NICELY. HE WANTED SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A BRIEFCASE LIKE DADDY'S...LOL. PLASTIC IS THICKER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE."
4,Correct Artists For This CD,"Here, in order, are the correct artist names for this CD. What is listed aboveare the songwriters. All are original recordings.Hall & OatesStarshipAlan Parsons ProjectEurythmicsExposePointer SistersR SpringfieldTacoHall & OatesDolly PartonBilly OceanSamantha Fox"
3,many problems,"This version has problems. The best things about it are the acceptable orchestra performance and the staging. The worst are the cast, or at least some of them. The woman who sings Eva is too old, her voice is not particularly good, and she makes weird grimaces when she sings. Botha, who sings Walther, is ridiculously obese although he sings well. David is not young enough and Sachs is okay but nothing to write home about. The chorus of 16th century German peasants is very odd with oriental faces among them. On my machine the sound had to be put at top level to be loud enough to be heard. Compared to this version, the Bayreuth one with Prey and Jerusalem is almost perfection. Jerusalem makes a fine Walther, Eva is young enough to be believable and the orchestra and staging are uniformly better. Take the Bayreuth version by all means over this one."
5,A Wonderful Introduction to Kabbalah,"This is a carefully crafted book that introduces some deep concepts in a clear and upbeat manner. You can tell that the Ciceros know the subject very well, but their writing is not condescending or confusing. I feel fortunate to have found this book and have read it numerous times because it started me on the path to spiritual goals. I highly recommend this book if you're starting to learn about the Tree of Life."

3,More valuable 5-10 years ago,"New statistics books containing R code seem to be coming out weekly. At one time I used this book a lot to get ideas on R/S programs that I needed to write. I now , seldom reference it, but go to other texts that contain R code on the topic I'm investigating. I have never liked the MASS documentation and the explanations in their book aren't much better. Many, of course will disagree with this.It is still an important book and the only place to find good code on certain topics, i.e., nnet, poor explanations aside.If you need sample code, though, go somewhere else first.Still, if you only have 3 or 4 statistics books with R/S code, this should be one of them for it's breadth alone."
5,Great resource!,"Astoundingly broad, while providing specific examples for use by readers. Exactly what I needed to finish my dissertation."
3,Raymond Waites Shams,"They were not at all what I ordered. I was expecting quilted shams that looked like the picture displayed online....what I got were full, huge pillows that look nothing like the picture! I was not happy."
2,Wrong guess,"The theory of Jesus being reincarnated in our time is quite dubious, even if there is evidence pointing toward a latter day Messiah. However, this Davidic Servant will be Archangel Michael himself and not Jesus. Jesus will not return physically on this earth before long. What will happen, however, will be something much stronger : His return in Glory, a spiritual return and encounter in which the spiritual veil will be lifted. We will see Him in all His glory, and we will see the true state of our mind as well. That's why this event, yet to come, is also called the 'judgement.'"
2,Not a great read,"I didn't really enjoy this book. The guy, Lazar was horrible to the girl. He pushed her away and was nasty to her. Don't get me wrong, the writer did a good job. I really felt empathy towards both of them, so when the guy hurt her feelings, I sort of felt it. The third book in this series is good, a lot better than this one."
5,Fast paced Romance,"I have read all three of this trilogy...and I love them all. It begins with this book, and the tortured lost sould of Lazar, and the heroine Alegra. This book is action packed and fast paced from the begining. The tension that is built between the characters is fantastic, and it is truly romantic.Foley does an excellent job of keeping thing moving, and making the reader feel as though they are in the story, holding on for the next ball to drop. The books are all hard to put down...so plan on setting aside a good amount of time when you begin reading them...as you will not want to stop.I love the sort of romance that is show in these books. There is a good amount of build up, and then it is not too much....just enough to make is sexy...but not vulgar. It is also good to be able to move through these books and continue to see the same return characters as they progress through their own lives.If you are reading this Foley...you could add another for Prince Leo...I would love that!"
3,Great beginning-Poor ending,"I enjoyed this book until I got to the last few chapters. It then lost the rhythm, and skill of the rest of the book. It almost felt as if Ms. Foley had a deadline to meet and rushed through the ending without tying up all the loose ends. I don't want to give away any of the ending, but what happened to the Princess? Did she just fade away? Why did Allegra just accept Lazar, even after all the atrocious things he said to her? I think he should have had to fight a little harder to make it up to Allegra."
2,Super Cliche'!,I could not get into this book. Both the hero and heroine came off as super cliche' despite the less than common plot line. BORINGGG! Don't understand how this book has almost perfect reviews...
4,Wonderful story on the high seas,"This is my first read by this author and will not be my last. This is an entertaining story that grabbed my attention from page one. I loved the setting, the characters, and the plot. Lazar is definitely one of those ""heart-throb"" heros. I liked Allegra, but wished she had a little more backbone in places. All in all a good read, but the ending was a little rushed. I thought there were a few loose ends that should have been explained."
3,"Very Intense, almost too much.","I have to give it to Gaelen Foley, she is a very good writer and is very intense. This is the second book of hers I have read. I also read Lady of Desire. I have to say that I enjoyed that book a lot more than this one. Don't get me wrong, this book had some great plot climax's, but I couldn't get passed the horrible way Lazar treated Allegra. I know he was doing it because he couldn't fathom lossing her, but he went WAY overboard. If I were her, I would have slapped him and took off an made him come find me on the island. I agree with another reviewer that thought he needed to try a little harder to get her back, she took him back too quickly in my opinion. I enjoyed the begining of the book, but wasn't as thrilled by the end of it.All things said, however, I would still recommend it as a read to anyone interested. I will more than likely read the next series, ""The Princess."" The previewed first chapter caught my interest."
5,BY FAR THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ,BRAVO! FOLEY HAS THE BEST LOVE STORY IVE READ. I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT AND COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. THEN I READ IT AGAIN 2 WEEKS LATER. BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. THANK YOU GAELEN.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I have read all of Gaelen Foley's books and this one is one of my favorites. Ms. Foley has portrayed a man who is one of the most intense heroes that I have read about. Lazar is my idea of the 'ideal' hero. In many historical romances today the man is pushing the woman away because he is a womanizing rake. This isn't the case with Lazar. He desperatley wants Allegra's love to save him from the demons of his past that he is constantly fighting.Not only is this a favorite of mine from Foley, but one of the best Historicals I have ever read."
3,It was okay...,"The premise of the story is good and in some ways it is well executed, but the writing style is a bit like whiplash. No one in this book can make up their minds on anything! Which makes for quite an annoying read...but it still has it's moments. I have the next two books and hope they are a bit more well thought out than this one."
5,The excitement just keeps on comming,"In this book, Secrets, Rae tries as hard as she can to find out about her mother and her past. Because she knows her ability is somehow connected to her mother and if she dosen't hurry her own body will beat her stalker in killing her. Usually she would run to Anthony and ask for help but he seems to have more important things to do ever since he started at her school. Rae is furious at him. It looks like it's just Rae and Yanna now to solve the ongoing mystery but Rae could be walking into a trap. THis book was great. Melinda Metz once again delivers suspense, romance, and mystery in book [amt]. I can't wait till the next book, Betrayel, comes out. I hope it's just as good as this one. I reccomend Secrets to anyone who's a fan of the series and wants to read more. Have fun!"
5,"Wonderful...more Giardinelli translations, please!",Read this in one sitting...Wonderful plot and great characters. This is what finding new authors is all about.
5,one of the best writers ...,"I have read in the longest time . I was going to write that he is the best writer form argentina , but that statement does not do him justice . I too read this book in one sitting and since then giardinelli has become one of my favorite writers . I own every one of his books . The ending is surprising and also genius. Get this book you definitely will not regret it ."
2,Order size ........,"Bra is comfortable but need to order the size up, to small. So if you need 34B try ordering the 36B for better fit. It won't be to tight."
1,Terrible bra!,"One of the worst bra I've ever purchased. Ordered my normal size and the fit was terrible. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with it and it can't be returned."
5,Finally a bra I can love,I bought this after reading the reviews and I was not disappointed. The wires don't poke me and the fit is great. This is a very comfortable bra with good support.
2,Did not care for these at all!~,Did not care for these at all!~Breezies Applique Microfiber Seamless Bra with Patented Ultimair Lining $34 As Seen on Tv Shopping Channel....very average bra not much support would not recommend!~
4,Very Soft,"I am very difficult to fit. The material used in this bra is very soft; however, the fit is not very comfortable. It is probably just me. I would say the product is great."
2,not much there,"I will agree that thei book is mildly amusing, but I also agree in part with the reviewer who described Kate as a whiney brat. The bigger issue is that she has no real personality, she is just an object of other people's love which, as far as I can tell, she does nothing to merit. While I enjoy the email format, I think it exacerbates the problem of character development and here, I think the only character that seems like a person (although a fantasy person) is Jack. Also found th eending not at all believable."
3,"Too many coincidences, but decent summer read","Finished this easily in an afternoon by the pool. Enjoyable, but not believable. I didn't find Kate (the main character) as self-centered and unsympathetic as other reviewers. In fact, her antics made me laugh. Overall, though, the book is forgettable - everything comes togeter just a little bit too neatly in the end."
3,Amusing...,"This is a very amusing book, and a quick read. Kate Bogart is a great heroine; gusty, uninhibited, jetting off to London or San Francisco at a moments notice.I love the way the author wrote Kate, but why must all the other characters e-mail in the same voice? I know my friends and I all have very different e-mailing/writing styles. The only distinction I saw in the main characters is that one used British terms.But nonetheless, a quick, pleasant read, perfect for a vacation or when the summer heat is already overtaxing your brain."
3,Bubble Gum for the Brain,"This book is fun. You're not going too think much about it. You're not going to have much compassion for any of the characters. And you're probably not going to remember it afterwards. But, so what? The email exchanges that make up the book are very witty and occasionally a little sexy. It's a great book to bring along to the pool this summer, and you'll finish it in no time at all. And, hey, if nothing else, it may inspire you to be a little more creative in your own email correspondence."
5,Love it - use it on every cake,"I love this! I use it on every cake a make, even the ones that are not fondant covered! It works great with the paper towel smoothing method!"
4,Good product for its price,Used this a couple of times and sure beats rubbing down fondant with your hands. Gives cake a clean finish. Thank you Amazon for the quick shipment as well!
2,Broke imediately,"This prduct maybe good but it broke before I had the opportunity to fully use it. I can repare it with a little glue, the handle came off."
2,Flimsy,This is just a flimsy piece for plastic. You'd be better off using a spoon or spatula. Thus thing is pointless.
5,Satisfied,"Does what it is meant to do, smooth fondant. I am please with this purchase, it helps me make my cakes look pretty :)"
3,I Own This But Don't Bother Using It,"I know some people like these, but I don't find them very useful. I end up using my hands instead."
3,Double,"The product description says ""wilton fondant smoother"" not smoother(s) i did recieve two. i ordered another one and i got 2 so now i am stuck with 4 fondant smoothers and i only wanted 2."
4,Spot On Examples,"I've always liked the Megatrend series, this one does not disappoint. I can't add anymore then what other positive reviewers have stated. Entrepreneurs and like minded business folks - invest in this book for inspiration."
3,I wanted to like this book...,"I wanted to like this book, especially with the trends she described toward conscious capitalism and spirituality in business (in my mind, this is defined BROADLY). In any case, I am not one to insist upon supporting stats and hard evidence for something I intuit to be true, but I have to admit, this was a little too loose for me. I agree with the Megatrends, but did not like the presentation."
3,Reading the book was better,"Patricia - the author - narrates this CD edition. And since she's not speaking to a crowd, but sounds like she's talking to a mike in a closet with sleeping neighbors next door, she gets so quiet at times, that she's hard to hear. Then if you turn the volume up, you're likely to have your ear drums rattled the next time. Reading the book was better."
2,harder to follow than most,"This routine is a good workout, but somewhat hard to follow. I do a lot of at-home stuff and I am not the best at catching onto some routines, but usually I do pretty well. But with this workout there was too much going on, too many steps. I would much more preferred the intense exercises without the many steps to go with them. I would say this workout is best for quick learners and you need a bit of room to move in, more than my other workouts."
3,Very good intermediate/advanced level workout.,"This is a very good workout provided you're familiar with the type of movements the instructor does. I'm at a beginner's level so it was very hard for me to follow. I plan on challenging myself with it, doing small sections at a time (15/20 min.) just to learn the footwork and moves. I think it will require time, care and consciuous movement so as to avoid injuries and feel it as a fun workout. It will take a significant learning curve but I think it's worth it.I only gave it 3 stars because no explanation/modifications of moves were provided. It would have been very helpful to have a segment dedicated to detailing a bit more the major moves. I'm persistent and have a clear goal as to where I want to go in terms of my physical fitness so I'll make it a learning process but it can easily discourage and make you feel incompetent and lost with the many moves and changes. A true shame because I really do see it as a very effective and fun workout."
4,The Indo-europeans from the Caucasus,"This beautifully written and well-illustrated book explains to junior readers everything they might want to know about the Indo-europeans as they must have appeared at the spread of Kurgan III, about 3000 BC or so. It is an excellent adjunct to such works as the American Heritage Dictionary, which lists Indo-european roots. It is a valuable source for reports and papers. After reading this book, your child will know what is meant by some major terms of ancient history: Kassites, Mitanni, and the like, and just what we have in common with the people of Iran and India. The book does have one minor flaw: its date. Without benefit of Mariya Gimbutas, Vlahos has all the people of India and Europe pouring out of the valley between the Great and Little Causasus, an unlikely scenario. What happened to the Georgians there we never hear."
1,"Pickin' On ""Pickin' on Classic Rock""","I was really disappointed in this offering in contrast to other disks in the ""Pickin' on"" series. While the others feature interesting arrangements that make the songs truly bluegrass - this one basically played the same arrangements with slight modifications and different instruments. In my opinion, this one had a really dark quality about it, and there were moments where I could have sworn I was riding in an elevator or on hold with really obnoxious muzak in the background. I highly recommend most of the other ""Pickin on"" CD's, but stay away from this clunker."
2,Not a good fan for massive exhaust needs,"This fan works fairly well for what I use it for (glassblowing), but I would like a more powerful fan. It has a major design flaw, the housing has slots on the sides, so there's no channel or duct for the air to go through, a lot of air goes out the sides. I fixed this by taking the blade off, then duct taping all around the inside of the housing to create a channel. It works ok, but it's not quite strong enough"
2,Good for someone who knows nothing about Flash,"Flash 5 for Dummies provides a good introduction for people who are not familliar with a program. Personally I find the books too basic, allowing one to get started, but not learn anything further than the basics. I suggest the Flash 5 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart Guide as a better, smarter alternative for someone who wants to learn more than the basics."
4,The Answer,It's a great book. That outlines the right way to date in todays world. It tells the four stages of friendship and how we skip over the most important parts to get to the physical. It has help me and my new friend to get to know each other the right way and more important God's way.
3,Solid but Plenty of Room for Improvement,"Well, in honest truth, the best review I can give is instead of 'Waiting and Dating,' read 'Understanding the Power and Purpose of Men.' It covers the same material, but goes into far more detail and hits several other points that are more than beneficial. It's not that this book is not good. It just is lacking, and somewhat hard to retain the key points and principles established. In summary, it seems more like an introduction to 'Understanding...' Give it a try, however, but my advice remains to choose the other book.God bless"
3,Pretty good,The book was pretty good. He shared some vital points on relationship building and it was very insightful.
5,Filled with Timeless Principles,"I really enjoyed reading this book as is is filled with practical relationship building advice that is never really taught. It is for young couples, as well as couples that have been married for longer periods of time. The one thing I would add is for people who desire a long lasting relationship and before they can build that lasting relationship a must read is Shelton'sLove (You Deserve Better: Tips & Steps on Finding Mr. Right), which talks specifically about finding the right partner in life."
2,NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN,"I had a hard time getting through this one. The charactersseem like cardboard and stereotypical. There was way too muchdescription and not enough chills. I really couldn't relate much to the characters or the plot for that matter. The old haunted house routine is being written to death. ...My two favorites are Peter Straub's Ghost Story and Dark Side: The Haunting by J. M. Barlog and this one is no comparison. You want some chills, check out those instead."
3,Dolls Dolls,This was my first Tamara Book. I enjoyed the creepy ghosts and gotta admit..the sex parts were good too. The whole Idea of buying and old haunted house so you can write one in...I thought was great!
5,"A stunning book, well written with wonderfull twists.","I don't usually read horror, I've read a little Stephen King (kinda have to living in the same town as the guy). Tamara Thorne's books enthrall me though. Her view of ghosts in this book is extravagant. Her writting captures the reader and keeps you reading untill you hunger for more. I anxiously await more from her as she is a wonderfull writer."
5,One of the best I have read,"I picked up the book in a grocery store and bought it on a whim. I had never heard of her and it seems she only has two books out (Haunted and Moonfall). The book is wonderful, the characters vivid and the story chilling. I stayed up so long reading it! Haven't done that in a while! I did some research and it seems she has another pen name, Chris Curry, under which, if I am correct, she has written a few books (often with a partner, Lisa Dean), I am sure they are worth a read! I certainly hope she shows us more of her talent!"
2,Big letdown,"Like several other people have commented, I purchased this book based on the excellent reviews. It is a decent story at best. Several things need to be said: it is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, scary. There are several creepy sequences, but that is it; NOT horror. Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless ""build"" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn't building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is ""scary!"" or ""terrifying!"" shouldn't read horror novels whatsoever. I've read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary."
4,An excellent read!,"Being a very picky reader, I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed this book. It's not the typical ""horror"" read and contained alot of new ideas. Several times I found myself actually seeing scenes play out vividly in my mind, which to me - separates the Good books from the really excellent ones! Bravo, Tamara Thorne! Write MORE! :-)"
5,"Haunted, Moonfall",Tamara Thorne should sit on her typwritter and never stop writting !!!!!! When i started her books i could not stop until i was trough the whole book. This women is a great writer !!!
4,highly enjoyable,"i picked this book out randomly, i was in the mood for a good ghost story. this book definitely was that. haunted house books tend to be hokey, but not this one. among other things, i was hooked by the writing style by the second page (this rarely happens) and couldn't put the book down. i felt drained when it ended and had become so comfortable with the well drawn characters that i missed them when it was over. i loved how visual the writing was, you could almost feel like you were there. if you enjoy suspense stories, this one's for you. but if you are looking for a scarry book, this isn't it."
5,Great Little Machine,"All in all, the TH55 is a great little machine. The flip lid is a little klutzy, the on/off switch is a bit awkward to manipulate, and there is no native landscape support. Still, these are minor inconveniences for a PDA that comes with lots of features in a well-engineered little package."
3,No Outllok 2003 Support,"This is an excellent PDA, but Sony and all the reseller sites I have visited are hiding the fact that it will not Sync mail with Outlook 2003. I had to call Sony support to find this out. Support said they are working on a patch but wouldnt tell me when. I hate to return this device but I need email to sync."
2,unfortunate,"Wonderful book for illiterates who may need a large-type, one paragraph summary of the great books of the century. Useless for the serious book-lover. Gracias"
2,Why so few really superb books?,"It is a great idea to offer a handly little volume that recommends the greatest books written in the 20th century but after reading this volume I am baffled. Instead of ""The Yearling"", any volumes by Laura Ingalls Wilder, ""The Death of a President"" by William Manchester or his two volume biography on Churchill (""The Last Lion"") ,""Mere Christianity"" by C.S Lewis or ""Knowing God"" by J.I Packer (which has sold over one million copies) and other truly fabulous works of literature we are left with such drivel as ""Lolita"", ""The Catcher in the Rye"" (the most hyped book ever published) and books by Betty Friedan, Hitler and Margaret Sanger!If controversy sells books then this should be on top of the charts. There were only three titles that I agreed should have been in the book. Don't waste your money or time on this volume."
2,"Good Wire, Bad Measurement","The product itself works well, whether its 10 gauge or not I'm not sure, I think its closer to 12 gauge but still good for what I need.My complaint with the product is the same as a previous reviewer; I ordered 50ft needing about 50ft. I cut four 10ft length wire and found that I only had 3.5ft left for the last."
1,Order it...if you can wait,"Ordered as ""in stock"" item with estimated shipping time 1-3 weeks (I did not need it urgently). After 1.5 month the cable still has not been shipped. Checked the item page and it was saying ""out of stock""."
4,"Original recordings, original artists","The cuts on this CD are the original, full-length studio recordings by the original artists."
3,A Damned Good Compromise!,"Of course, the editors were damned if they did and damned if they didn't -- select other passages from the 500 other Loeb volumes. Would I have made a different selection? OF COURSE!But what do I want to have in my briefcase in case my flight is delayed, the newspapers are depressing and the magazines insipid?Why this handy anthology! Absolutely a worthy purchase. Where else can you tuck into some choice passages from Cicero, savor Lucretius' account of peace of mind, snack on Aristotle without gagging and get a tremendous belly-laugh from Petronius or Juvenal?This is a no-brainer and a great gift, too!"
3,"brevity may be the soul of wit, but this needs to be bodied out","120 pages of english translation as an introduction to a library of several hundred volumes? drop the latin and greek, and triple the length."
5,Great All-Purpose Knife,This knife is a sturdy sharp looking knife with the quality that comes with its name. Good for an everyday knife or as a camping/hunting tool. Solid locking feature that can be trusted. Lifetime Warranty. Great overall knife.
4,Good product,"Good product. Is the first time a use a Mothers Powerball, very easy use, do a great job. Save time polishing your wheels. I highly recommend to other people who wants a professional touch on your car."
2,power ball,This product works well if you want to strip paint. Do not use this product if you have any paint on your wheels that you want to keep there
4,If you have Billet Wheels this is it,"The powerball products work well, if you have wheels and other billet goodies this will become your best buddy!"
5,Good Product,"Works well for getting into smaller places.It is very good for wheel rims and car grills.A bit pricey, but worth the extra money."
1,Save your money!,"This thing is an even bigger rip off than Mothers ""PowerMetal"". I expected a fairly heavy duty, functional tool for the price. Surprise, surprise, it's a cheap piece of junk. Within a minute of using it, the crappy ball came detached from the shaft (oops, I guess it's made to rotate in ONLY ONE DIRECTION). The junk foam is off center, so, the thing flops around on the work piece like a carp out of water. Pass by this one and get a decent polishing wheel."
2,not what i expected,"not what i expected, i thought it would be a little more hightech, more powerful. Not sure it is worth it for the price."
4,Mothers MR005140 PowerBall Polishing Tool,This great little tool saved my rims that have been tarnished for ten years. They look like new.
3,Ok but still not small enough,"I bought this small one because their large Powerball is really too big to do normal-sized auto wheels. But this small one is 'still' too big to fit into my 15"" wheels. I guess it was designed for a SUV. C'mon Mothers, how about a teeny one... (see the comments below on this review)"
5,Immediately useful,"I've been programming Java applications that access Oracle databases for over a year now, and I found this book very useful. I liked the fact that it is useful to both beginners and advanced users like me. I especially liked the section on EJBs."
2,Author's tone was flippant,Too much meditation and visualization for me. I thought the author's attitude was flippant; as if getting back to work is anything FAST.
4,Beautiful photography,"A wonderful book for photographers who want to connect with the meaning of their work, and the way photography changes how you see things."
5,Impeccable.,"When you hear the artistry put forth in this collection and consider that Dominguez plays all the string instruments heard therein, it becomes all the more remarkable. Sadly, it is the last album put out by this underrated artist who spanned nearly all musical styles in his short career. Worth having in a collection for those who love flamenco/gypsy guitar. Easily rivals anything the Gypsy Kings produced."
4,Cool album,"When I am in the mood to listen to some old school 90's music, I like to pop in this CD and listen to it. It brings back fond memories of my preteen to teenage years. I also have the Soul of the 80's CD. That one is really good,because even though I was a little girl in the 80's I still remember listening to the songs on the radio and I loved them."
2,Didn't match expectations.,"I was really excited to get this filter but it didn't meet my expectations from the start. When I opened it the ring that holds the glass in place was partially popped out. I figured I would work to get it back in and when I did I noticed that the ends of it didn't meet. Should you accidently drop the filter or something hit it, I wouldn't be surprised if the glass popped out. Further, when I tried it on my dslr the results were not near what I expected. I'm not saying it completely horrible; I only took a few shots and I'll need to try it out in different environments to see if it works any better. Overall, however, I was dissapointed in the quality, esp for the price I paid. I've bought $10 filters that worked far better than this."
4,not my favorite,"I was disappointed that this book's layout was so busy and hard to follow. Some good ideas are there, but not as many as I had hoped."
4,Fun game,"Find myself yelling back at the guide who is trying to provide useful information. But all in all, fun to play. My 14 year old grandson liked it real well."
1,Doesn't work right + NO customer support,"1- The software doesn't work properly, and there are no instructions provided in the booklet. 2- The tutorial doesn't work properly either; I found myself driving the boat in circles without being able to accelerate or get into deeper water, and casting the rod is also impossible. There are no instructions on locating and using the fishfinder/sonar device, choosing bait, etc. 3- WORST of all, I followed the help advice and emailed the software manufacturer for assistance, but nobody responded! The combination of a non-working game with a non-responsive help department would hasten my suggestion that you AVOID this game!"
4,Fun game!,"My sister got this game for me on my 9th birthday. I loved it and still love it. So that tells you kids can like it to. If your child has an interest in fishing I would get this game for them because children can get impatiant, but fish bite in under a minute. The only thing hard is the controlls (but you can change them by going to options an clicking controlls.) The controlls they give you to steer the boat are w,s,a,and d. to cast the fishing line you use the left click of your mouse when you catch a fish and want to real him in keep holding the right mouse button and thats it! If you like fishing buy this game!"
1,Wish it worked,This is a fun game but it locks up my pc. I have a p4 2.8 with an ati 9700 pro card. It also locked up my other pc-- I hope thay can get the bugs out of game or an update to graphic drivers. Seems like they might have beta tested this or something. At least i got a free rapala lure with it.
1,Terrible,"Long story about why I even have this disc, but it's awful. Seriously some pop trash. And I love pop music generally! But this is really, really bad, the worst stereotype of what pop music can be."
4,Better than expected play.,"What a flood of memories this game brought back when playing on the PC. The game makers set out to duplicate the arcade version of the game for home users and that is exactly what was accomplished. The majority of the game play was exactly re-created for the new generation of gamers seeking a little bit of yesteryear and the way in which video games evolved. Fortunately, with the additional versions being offered with this anniversary set, the game was well worth the purchase price. Considering I didn't have the funds to try and complete Dragon's Lair 2 and Space Ace in their original incarnation. I was excited to try and learn how one might win out against these versions in the home format. This one is definitely one for the avid old school games."
3,"Mediocre video quality, but the game play is crisp and tight.","I was disappointed with the video quality - it looks like a second generation video copy. So I went and blew almost $70 on the DVD-ROM HD version of just Dragon's Lair. The HD version's quality was great but the game play was laggy and scenes would start half-way into the action on occasion. Before you say I need a better computer do note that this was on a Core 2 Duo e6600 with a Geforce 7600GT video card. The CD-ROM version's gameplay is much snappier, plus you get Dragon' Lair II, Space Ace, and a lot of ""Making Of"" type material on the extras disc. In the end, I would say get both of them. ^_^"
5,Entertaining,Very fun and very much like the arcade version I played years ago.This is a game for all ages to enjoy I highly recomend it for pure entertainment vaule!
5,Great Book,"About a year after 9/11, I was thinking there are so many little things terrorists could be doing, Why aren't they? All of a sudden we went from not being able to prevent planes from being hijacked to being able to prevent suicide bombers from blowing themselves up in malls. Or is it simply, there just aren't that many that want to attack us and have other concerns (moderate Islamic gov't's, European countries). This book discusses all this and more. Very enlightening read that rightfully questions conventional wisdom."
5,Excellent book!,This author is great in his field. His research is thorough and credible. I am getting my master's in Homeland security and have used this author as resources several times.
1,They fell apart!,"I bought these slippers, for my daughter, at the recommendation from a friend. I wanted something with a more sturdy bottom so they would last. My daughter LOVED them and said they were sooooooo comfortable. HOWEVER, after only have them for three days they started to fall apart. The ""rubber"" part of the sole fell apart bit by bit and we didn't even realize it until there was a hole separating the material part of the slipper from the sole. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"
2,Not so good..,"Foam does not bounce back. It collapses after several uses. For the price they are ""ok"" slippers."
5,"Perfect for a telecommuter: comfortable, warm, and look great too!","Now that it's finally winter I've been wearing these every day and i have warm toasty feet. Comfortable fit and soft. Perfect slippers for the telecommuter!! (unlike other review, mine don't have problem with scratchy label)"
1,Not The Best,"These slippers would be very comfortable if it weren't for the placement of the ""Dearforms"" label. It is sewn in the inside heel area of the slipper and the corners of it (the label) curl/stick up and constantly poke your feet. It feels like one of those annoying plastic price tag holders is embedded in the insole making them impossible to wear. If you actually want to walk in slippers, these aren't for you."
1,Temporary slippers~scuff then fall to pieces,"I was delighted with my Dearfoams slippers until after a few weeks my entire house was covered with BLACK SCUFF marks which I realized came from the slippers. Then, in less then 3 months I noticed little pieces of black plastic - like stuff I was sweeping up off of the floors. These were also from the slippers. Now the pieces are much larger as the slippers are in their final stages of dis-assembling themselves. I do not wear these outdoors, nor do I use them for anything but keeping my feet warm on cold days. I am completely disappointed because they are in peices now and I still need affordable slippers. Do not buy these slippers unless you only need them for a few months. I avoid negative comments on products unless I feel it is a complete waste of my money. These should be described as temporary slippers."
4,Love these slippers,"I am so particular about my slippers. My family and friends tease me because I have so many slippers. I hate when they get lumpy inside, or the fuzz gets those little balls. I don't like the real thick slippers, I feel like I'm falling off to one side, and I like slippers that have a rubber sole so I can run out to get the paper without ruining them. These are so comfortable I bought some for a friend. I love the slight memory foam padding. They are warm and soft, easy to get into and they look nice. I'd buy lots more of these. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is the back part sometimes gets folded under my foot and I have to use my hands to lift it out. (I said I was really particular :-)"
4,Comfortable Slipper,"Having just had achilles tendon surgery I was looking for a comfortable slipper that didn't feel like it was ""flat"" when I wore it. The memory foam in these is very nice and gives you a cushioned feeling.My only problem with these slippers is about 1 1/2 months after buying them, the plastic sole on one of them split open right across the side. So now all the inner parts are falling out of one of my slippers.I am going to try another pair of these because I found them the most comfortable of all the slippers I've tried, and hope that my experience with the cracking plastic sole was only an isolated problem."
3,DISAPPOINTED,THE SLIPPERS LEAVE BLACK MARKS ON MY FLOOR THAT I HAVE TO SCRUB UP EVERYTIME I WEAR THEM. I LOVE THE MEMORY FOAM AND THE FEEL OF THE SLIPPERS SO WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY LEAVE THE BLACK MARKS ON THE FLOOR.
4,Great Slippers,I bought these for my wife as a Christmas present. The only drawback was that we recieved the wrong color. The slippers were well-made and very warm and soft.
5,Can't beat it for the money!,"For the money, great package of heavy duty Monster wire!!! I was able to complete my home theater with this. What else is there to say?"
2,"Good Wire, Bad Clips","The wire is fine, pretty heavy gauge. But the clips used are pin clips that with newer equipment are very hard to use. I cut the pin clips off and replaced with banana clips(which match up with most newer, mid to upper end equipment). You would be better off going to a good audio store and getting monster cable in bulk and putting on the banana clips yourself than using this setup. I did use the component plugs, they were fine."
4,good but not excelent,"this set has an excelent sound, but dont make magic if you dont have the rigth equipment"
2,A Bit Too Top Heavy,"This is a really cute belly ring in person, but the only problem is it is a bit top heavy and it's a bit hard to screw the ball on since it's not hinged and the chain gets in the way as well."
2,plastic,"If you are into plastic breasts and plastic plots, you will enjoy this. This is not even near the quality of other movies based on ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" in plot, acting or any other way. We will probably give it to Goodwill or a local library."
1,Don't Waste Time or Money,"If you buy this CD thinking the music is going to be as hot as the cover, you will be sadly mistaken. The first cut starts off with an awful attempt at what is ""suppossed"" to be disco music accompanied with some even more awful vocals, and then it goes downhill from there. And you get 2 CD's of this crap for your pleasure! Don't waste your time or your money. I will be using these disc as drink coasters because that is about all they are good for."
5,Hugh Has Another Winner,"In this well organized book, Hugh Carpenter has distilled the essence of cooking great fish. The recipes are simple and quick with lots of flavor and the photography makes these recipes a feast for your eyes. I especially enjoyed the Stir Fried Swordfish with Asian Spices. And when he says fast he means fast. Cooking the swordfish for about a minute is all it takes. Have everything else ready on the hot plates."
5,Excellent healthcare resource for all,"This book is an excellent resource for people of all ages who are interested in finding credible information from common day-to-day ailments to life-threatening diseases. In the confusing and unfortunately, sometimes misleading world of the Internet, this book helps pave a clear path to finding the most accurate and up to date information available today."
5,The most helpful and reliable source I've found!,"When I was diagnosed with cancer three years ago and spent a lot of time researching the disease and its treatment, ""Healthcare Online"" was exactly the kind of book I needed but didn't have. It's clear and easy-to-use, though quite sophsticated in its research assistance, and very, very helpful in providing ways to separate out the valid information from the misleading or phony stuff. In the areas I researched intensively, it lists all the sources I eventually found for myself, plus some very useful sites I never discovered. I often counsel newly-diagnosed individuals with my disease and now will pass on this book as a gold mine for their own inquiries."
3,"Good source, but missing the key...","I found that this book had a great many resources online for finding physicians within particular specialties (i.e. one site for radiology doctors, one site for cardiology doctors, etc), but did not have mention of any sites that put all specialties and regions together. One such site to find a doctor is <a href=""http://www.appointmentnet.com"">http://www.appointmentnet.com</a>, or even WebMD... although Appointment Net has the easiest search for finding doctors, and even allows you to make appointments and renew prescriptions online."
5,A Lighthouse Lover's Must Have,I am an avid collector and visitor of lighthouses and I think this book is amazing!! The illistrations are spectacular!!! And the stories about the history of each lighthouse are very enlightening!! Every lighthouse collector and lover must have this book!!
4,worth picking up,"The good tracks of this c.d. is 1.fury dont play that 4.undercover lover and from side 2, 1.anytime is party time and my favorite 2.games of the lame. The rest of it is just bass filler with electronic star wars and battle star galactica like sound efects which arn't that bad, but after too many listens can become a bore. Since there is no selection for 31/2 stars i'll give it the benefit of the doubt and give it 4. Bass out."
1,residents review,"I received this book for free. Although not bad in content, it is far to basic to be of any use to a neurology RESIDENT."
3,Just Okay,"I really like the Sesame Beginnings series, but this is not my favorite in the line. It just doesn't have much. I understand that it is for 0-6 months, but even at 3 months, my baby preferred the 6+ month books with real words and sentences(i.e. ""How Big is Baby Elmo?"")My son is uninterested until we get to the last page with the mirror, and even then, it makes him no more excited than our wall mirror...Overall, it's not a bad book, but it's just not as good as the others in the series."
5,Great Book for Infants,My son and I began reading this book when he was just a couple of months old and now he is 9 months and he still loves it!!
2,Check this one out at the library,Not worth the money. There are only a handful of faces (with one word descriptions)...and even with so few: one is very unclear!!!
2,Wasted potential,"I first saw Gary Gulman on Last Comic Standing and he was hilarious on it so it led me to find out more by him. I bought the CD ""Conversations with Inanimate Objects"" and laughed my butt off the whole way through. I highly highly recommend the CD! So after that I sought out ""Boyish Man"", expecting to to be laughing the entire time again, only to be dissapointed. Half of the jokes are reused from his CD, and the other half weren't very funny. I laughed very little and sold this immediately after watching it. Do yourself a favor and buy his CD ""Conversations with Inanimate Objects"" and skip this. If you're really adamant about watching a comedy show as opposed to just listening to it, then fine. This DVD isn't terrible by any means but when half of the jokes are identical to the ones on his previously released CD, it loses its value. Gary Gulman, from what I've seen, is a very funny man and I really wish he would make more CDs or DVDs."
2,disappointed,"I've seen him live, and this seems to be a collection of his worst jokes. Maybe it's older than I thought, and he's more refined now...I don't know the reason, but if I was him, I'm stop the continued publishing of this dvd as i don't feel it's on the same level as his contemporaries, or even his regular shows. This one's getting tossed out cuz it's definately not worth seeing twice."
4,Hilarious!!!,My Movie came swiftly and on time and when I popped it in it had me in stitches. This is sure to have you laughing for days. It's worth each cent!!!
4,Gotta love Gary Gullman!,"I'm glad I bought this DVD, Gary Gullman is hilarious!! I totally thought that his comedy career would take off after Last Comic (he was my favorite that season), but unfortunately I haven't seem much of him since. I hope he gets his head back in the comedy game and comes out with more of these!"
3,Ninja Sword,"The sword it self if just fine for the amount paid but thesheath is very inferior, basically cardboard and tape. It broke almost immediately with no rough treatment at all. If it is possible to obtain a better sheath for this sword that would be good, even if we have to purchase it.Thank You, Charlie D'Accardo"
2,Bleak,"The setting is interesting in itself, but, but Sayles concentrates on a specific subset of details. The story line isn't that compelling, and I got tired of being treated to the bleakest, wretchedest aspects of Cuba. Decided to put it down."
4,One of Garlock's better Western Adventures,"This is one of Dorothy Garlock's better books, in my opinion. The characters are well developed and the plot is full of adventure. Willa is a strong, intelligent heroine who always manages to make the better of whatever hard situation is thrown her way - escaping a wild mob, fending off the advances of a lecherous gambler, taking on the role of semi-guardian to two orphaned teens along the way, nursing their injured aunt back to health, and taming the heart of a grief-stricken cowboy (Smith, our hero) who has up until now sought comfort in only a bottle. A very entertaining read and a lot of romantic tension between the hero and heroine. It grew a little weak towards the end, which is why I gave it only 4 stars, but it was still a very enjoyable book."
2,Good Basic Recruiting Information,"I found this two tape package to be very basic in recruiting contents. Both tapes contain common sense ideas regarding how to manage your time in the recruiting profession. I found the tape package to be a bit costly. In my opinion, you'd be much better off getting Brian Tracy's ""Time Management"" 6 tape package for about the same money you're spending here. Again, very basic information for the price!"
4,The Secrets are Out,"I found this a very useful experience - partly through the information on the tapes, partly because you listen to Bill himself. As to the content, I rate it highly. I've been in executive search just over four years and made the investment in the tapes to take me to a higher level of productivity. The package lives up to its promise. In the first tape Bill covers some very sensible suggestions for measuring the types of people you're dealing with and how to take a step up. The second tape covers delegation and explains some pretty basic ideas from what was for me, a new perspective. Putting these suggestions into practice is certainly helping my business. I have little hesitation in recommending these tapes, I'd have none if there were a bit cheaper."
3,"Un CD pasable, no es la gran cosa...","Bueno nuevamente jaja aqui tirando reviews, esta vez vengo con ""El Ultimo Ruido"" (The Noise 10: The Last Noise). Pues, sinceramente no me gusto mucho este cd. La mayoria de las canciones son buenas y las pistas excelentes pero los cantantes son los que no motivan mucho. Una de las canciones que realmente esta buena es la de Zion y Lennox que es una cancion bachatia', como dice Zion ""Bachatiau a lo Boricua"" jaja. Esa cancion ha sido un palo en PR. Tambn otras buenas es la de Baby Ranks, Baby Ranks, Jomar, Guelo Starr, Cheka, etc etc. No mal interpreten, el cd no esta malo, el cd esta bueno y bien hecho, pero no se, en mi opinion pienso que le hace falta como un toque especial. Pero el cd vale la pena comprarlo para completar la coleccion de Dj Negro."
3,WHY NOT READ A MAGAZINE?,"AS AN ABSOLUTE ADMIRER OF ELLEN AND DESIRING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE REAL LIFE OF ELLEN DEGENERES, I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED TO READ A BOOK THAT HAD NO IMPUT FROM ELLEN DIRECTLY. THIS BOOK WAS TOO INVOLVED WITH THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE GOINGS ON OF HER SHOW, THAN THE PERSONAL EVENTS IN ELLEN'S LIFE. OVERALL THE BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN, BUT VERY UNEVENTFUL."
5,The Real Deal,"This is the real deal, garage band heaven, most of it mixed and transfered well. If you like raw sixties rock with some serious attitude, this is for you. I look forward to ordering some of the other titles in this series."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS MOUSE","If you want to replace your mouse every 3-6 months, this is the mouse for you. This is NOT an exaggeration. If you prefer a quality product that will last, look somewhere else. I'm an IT/Helpdesk person and I have 11 broken Wowpen Eco mice sitting on my desk. Our employees love the way this mouse feels and that it's so light, but we told them we don't want to spend $30-$40 every 3-6 months buying them a new one. Most computer stores have stopped stocking these things because so many were being returned. Buyer beware!"
2,cheap mouse,"Left and right click buttons are not very responsive. Sometimes, you do not know if you clicked or not. Other than that, it works."
5,YOU are an American Idol!,"If you watch American Idol at least once a month, you'll enjoy this game because face it, there's some part of you that wants to be up there among the contestants!The reality is that this game is the closest that most of us will ever get, and while its not the real thing, playing this game can be just as funny as watching the show!Try it and see!"
2,Poor -- just a way for them to make money -- not a lot of thought given to the creation of the game.,"In brief ... the adults thought it was really bad and just a money maker with little thought to quality. We thought it could have been a lot of fun. ... the kids had fun, but also complained early while playing the game. Complaints were mainly about the judge random & repeated comments and the kids got confused a couple times following the dvd. Only two of the game choices were actually activities and the others involved sitting & watching really bad old performances. Everyone of all ages got bored with that. Also, the music was digital techno sounding junk and made it all sound the same. It was really poor quality music. Over all, I wouldn't buy it. It would be better to buy Karoke Cd's. PS -- I hate writing reviews, but this one needed it."
2,This is awful,"This game is awful. The object of the game is to accumulate stars. Stars are handed out randomly and there is no skill inolved whatsoever. The microphone is a cheap plastic toy and doesn't attach to anything. The only fun part is singing karaoke and doing some dance moves. However, you'd be better served just buying some karaoke cds. The judges reactions are random.My wife and I played with our daughters, ages 7 and 9. We all agreed that the game was a dud."
1,How Could You Give This a Positive Rating?,"I was shocked to see positive reviews for this terrible game. MAYBE a 10-year-old or below would be fooled for a few minutes that their game performance results in the judges' evaluations. It doesn't take long before you hear Paula say the same comments for the tenth time and everyone playing the game realizes their efforts to sing or dance are strictly make-believe. This one is only for the Barbie-doll set... badly overpriced for what's in the box, to boot."
3,"Useful, but a little out of date and laboured","Recommended to me by a change management consultant as the best book available on the subject.The opening chapters deal with the historical leading lights of workplace efficiency and organisational design. This is interesting and informative.Later chapters outline Weisbord's ideas on work design, organising a business, guidelines for ree-organising and generally shaking down an organisation. It can be a litle tedious to winkle out the ideas, but some of them are worthwhile.Final chapters provide guidelines on consulting and helping people through a major change. Applied common sense proven in action makes this section the most worthwhile part of the book.A book worth reading, but not essential. My expectations were perhaps a little too high."
1,Ordered new but came used!,"I ordered a new book, paying the NEW price but when it arrived it the pages were written and underlined with pen. Then I receive a statement that read ""new standard used condition."" That is not what I signed up for! This is distracting and I wanted to create my own notes since its for a class. I would not recommend this seller."
4,My son loved it!,"It was pretty rare that I would pop in a DVD for my son, but of the three we owned, he by far loved this one, so it became my # 1 choice. The vibrant colors pop on screen, and there is a good variety of the visual images. Would definitely indicate that I think this is more geared towards young babies / maybe early toddlers."
2,"Lotsa action, not much acting.","Depending on what you like, you might like this movie a lot. There are lots of chases, crazy crashes and millions of dollars of damage to the city and vehicles on the way to catch the bad guy and save the girl.Maybe it's just me, but I am always perplexed by movies showing FBI agents as less than intelligent and competent. My personal experience while (small and brief) was not like that, and I have always understood that it is crazy hard to even be accepted by the academy, but who knows. It just seems like TV and movie directors seem to have some axe to grind with the FBI and this film continued the trend.The whole bad guy and the game of cat and mouse with Cena's character was a bit over the top for me, but it is not really worse than most movies of the genre'. So if you are a fan, don't let me dissuade you. I got it because it was on deal from Video on Demand, and I don't want my $2 back, it's just I wont be rushing out to buy the DVD either.2 *"
1,Horrible Shaky Camera,"A 10 year old could have filmed this with all the camera shake. It makes me dizzy. This was shot by a idiot. There is no GD excuse for putting out a movie with all this totally unnecessary camera movement. I wish the ""movie critics"" would point out this terrible defect (in their excessively long and boring reviews) so others wouldn't waste $30. This is happening far too often. PS; this movie has no story at all so what's to write about anyway?"
3,12 Rounds on Blu Ray,12 Rounds wouldn't play on my Blu Ray Player at first & only 6 months old if that till downloaded the latest firmware on a USB Stick and than played perfect with a Great Picture & as for the sound wasn't bad with some good action scenes especially towards the end but nothing like o as good as any of the Die Hards ... three out of five .
1,Poop,"This movie was just a piece of poop. And the block head steroidal Frankenstien looking piece of wood that is the leading man makes the pile of poop 10 times more stinky. This ain't the 80's and this mongoloid makes Arnold, Sly and even Dolph Lundgren look like DeNiro."
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"REMINDED ME OF STEVEN SEGAL BUT NEWER VERSION BUT NOT IN GOOD WAY AND CENA CANT ACT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY LOL,, HAH, SAME OL STORY AS ALWAYS AND FAKE STUFF HAPPENING ALL OVER JUST A POORLY DONE FILM!!! GET IT FROM A FREIND IF THEY HAVE IT DONT WASTE A DIME ON IT!!!"
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"If this movie didn't star a WWE Superstar, a lot more people would have seen this! It's a beat the clock thriller from the director of Die Hard and was a million times better than I thought it would be. John Cena defiantly shows a marked improvement from The Marine, no doubt thanks to Renny Harlin. Yes, it's a WWE film, staring a WWE wrestler, but it's one hell of an action thriller!"
4,surprisingly a really good movie!,I caught this movie on FX this afternoon. It has tons of action. Tons of excitement. The acting is subpar. Id rate it like B-..I kept waiting for commercials to end to see what would happen next!If you can get it for cheap (under $4) must buy
5,Exxciting Adventure and worth watching,"I liked this movie. John Cena is so hot !!!! If you are female, you'll love this movie."
1,Not worth buying at all,"Unfortunately there is no much details inside, it is not saying or showing how to exercise for the whole body, all what he is doing is posing in front of mirrors, I got no benefit from buying it & I do NOT recommend any one to buy it, thanks"
2,breaks easily,"whistle broke off on first day so now we need to somehow glue it back on to the bar. it did however actually whistle, which was pretty cool."
2,Its ok I guess.....,Well a coworker told me about this and I found it so I ordered it. The whole thing is super tiny but you can't talk with this in. The whistle is kinda hard to blow but you get the hang of it. The whistle broke off very quickly. It'd be nice if it screwed on but its just glued on. Its only $2 so I'm not gonna complain too much
3,"silly, but entertaining","We got this from the library, and it's fun to read. We are doing a homeschool unit on Ancient Egypt, but this book is not one we are using for any sort of report. Just trivia and a bit of gross-out -- lots of flies swarming around, corny puns, etc.But it's a hit!"
3,"Contemporary, Simple, but not my cup of tea","The cast recording of this 4-character-4-musician chamber musical had, actually, a good cast. Adam Heller, as the Russian-Jew immigrant to America gave an affirming performance to have the accent and emotion. Walter Charles is just suitable to be the part. Jacqueline Antaramian and Cass Morgan are OK to be in their parts either.However, the music and lyrics are pretty weak. Well, you can't be unimpressed by the first song ""The Stars"" which is beautifully orchestrated. The others are mixture of American, European style with some ""ornaments"" of Jewish music. The book itself may be a success, but not the musical."
2,A Troubling Movie,"I had previously been discussing this movie with another reviewer.I give the movie two stars, not for the movie's production quality or story-telling, but to raise questions that troubled me. Setting aside whether one believes in reincarnation or whether the child truly *was* the reincarnation of a deceased monk, should any religious organization have the power to essentially take a child away from its family? Yes, the family was asked. Yes, they agreed. But how freely given, truly, was their consent? The Tibetan Buddhists remain an insular and conservative organization whose powerful elites suffer all the foibles, intolerance and prejudices of any fundamentalist theocratic organization. What troubled me most was the seemingly unanswered question: Will the child's parents ever be able to visit him again?The answer seems to be, No."
4,Very good first person account of WWII in the Pacific.,"From an old Navy veteran: The book is rather short and in some cases repetitive, but from my studies of WWII in the Pacific this is an authentic, first-person account of this soldier's memory of the war against a sadistic, evil, brutal, suicidal enemy. I especially agree with his opinion that the U.S. Army was often overlooked when someone wrote about the war in the Pacific with so much press given to the bloody battles of the U.S. Marines. Don't misunderstand, the Marines were in some miserable, bloody, awful campaigns, but so were soldiers and sailors and they seldom get the recognition due them. This book gives some of that recognition to the soldiers."
1,Not like other stuff,"If you've read some of Wilson's other stuff, I found this one a bit over the top. It's a bit boring. Left me feeling like a moron for not having anything good to say about it, really. But if you've read the Illuminatus Triology, it's certainly not like those stories! If I'm missing the boat, I'll put my dunce cap on and go sit in the corner. Judging by other reviews, some people got it."
1,silly non serious crap,"I read this book a few days ago (the german translation indeed) the book is filled with non scientific and not proofable conlusions and theories, a mélange out of not really understood catch phrases ( i mean it seems as if the author had not understood the meaning of them ) and speculatory conjunctions of different scientific theories. For example the quantum mechanics and clairvoyance. No one with a little bit of an enlightened and critically education is able to believe more 10% of the content."
1,Geographic ignorance,"Even in Geography this author is confused. About Fatima - that is NOT in Spain, but in Portugal ! - the author it is no better, as almost foreigner authors that attempt to wirte on something that is far away of them, for instance the original and official records about the complexe serial of events in 1917. But since Fatima Apparitions are a icon to millions of people, so the authors each of them try to put a little gasoline in the fire or pepper in the meat ! Of course anyone can invent what they want, since he not claims to be any astounding secret delivered by ""uncovered source"" that is reael but unfortunally for the Histry is not able to be identified.Please, let's to be fair with true History: read the research books of the Portuguese historians Dr. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada if we want to know the real and factual Fatima history."
2,entertaining derivative nonsense,"Wilson is the biggest pseudo-mystic going. Like his hero Aleister Crowley, he is a very talented and entertaining writer who knows next to nothing about real mysticism, but is able to put together books that make it seem like he does. The difference is that Crowley was an original; Wilson gets all his (bad) ideas from other sources. Wilson's books are popular partly because he is such a funny and talented writer, but mostly because he gives people phony justifications for all the kind of self-indulgent hippie nonsense he believes in. Read Tim Leary's The Game of Life if you want to see where Wilson got the framework for this book, although it is even loonier. It would have been nice if either of these guys could have stopped taking dope for long enough to put together some coherent ideas..."
1,"Druggies suck as ""futurists""","I grew up reading the prophecies of these acid-tripping ""futurists"" like Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, F.M. Esfandiary et al., about we'd become ""physically immortal"" by now. How has that ""immortality"" worked out for these guys lately? Enough of this nonsense. They belong in the neighborhood of kooks like Hal Lindsey and Harold Camping."
2,The obvious stated as revelation.,"Just some 70's thinking with some fancy spin. Like much of that decade, more form than substance. The author has obvious encyclopedic knowledge on a wide variety of subject but uses it to make invidious analogies and conclusions."
5,A tool for change,"I bought this book after hearing many good things about it. I mainly expected to read a book regarding sociology and psychology, written by a very well-liked author. This was the first Robert Anton Wilson book I ever read, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.This book did not meet my expectations, it far exceeded them. Never before has a book produced such change in my way of thinking. My brain was literally completely reprogrammed after reading Prometheus rising. Every facet of thought that goes through my mind is different. I treat people differently. This is because I genuinely feel that I understand others, and myself much better now.I could not reccomend any book more highly than this. Also reccomended is the sequal, Quantum Psychology."
5,true power transmitted trough words,"Hi :) I'm a 25years old guy from Zagreb,Croatia..you know..Nikola Tesla,Penkala,TITO,Dubrovnik,War..I've downloaded RAW's audio interview and it's the first time I've heard his words..like I said,very powerful..After listening to what he has to say about everything, I realised that he is a very warm and smart person that can be very influecal..and I've let him be..Now(after reading his books)I feel smarter and warmer so I highly recommend it :) A beautiful book that will change your intire life or just a look of your bookshelve).Big support to RAW, it's nice to have him around :)"
5,One set of maps for exploring your own territory,"Until his death this past Spring of 2007, Robert Anton Wilson continued to prefer Leary's 8-Circuit Model as the best rough description of stages of development of consciousness, which he originally refined in the early 80's. While sarcastic and purposefully absurd at times, his viewpoints are nevertheless helpful in assisting us to look beyond our present, comfortable ""reality tunnels"", to considering alternatives. In order for us to evolve in consciousness, we must change it, and changing it can be uncomfortable (and potentially dangerous in many ways).Oliver Wendell Holmes said ""A mind stretched around a new idea never regains its original demensions"" - this book, when studied and thoughtfully applied, can be a set of maps for new territory. I found ""Prometheus"" to be a fascinating essay from a prolific, controversial writer -worth the effort."
5,Freedom,This book will loosen the tethers to the cultural programming that most of us are unfortunately coded with since birth. Read this book. Practice RAW's exercises. Enjoy experiencing new liberation and understanding.
5,Important Book!,"Have you ever wondered what makes you tick? Allow this author to spell out for you an interesting map of life. This is a delightful book, and it has the potential to take you out of your own head, and look at yourself. It is a workbook of sorts with exercises that make Wilson's points more tangible. This book seems quite unique, and I have not seen anything else like it. This is a good one to read several times. You can read this one slowly, over the course of weeks, months, or dare I say years. I especially like the author's scientific and unexpected linear approach to concepts such as the way our brain operates. It is difficult to deny the long list of disturbing truths in this book."
5,Just as expected,"My computer is pretty old and it came with 512 MB with windows XP and I just need it to upgrade it so it could be faster and have all the programs I use running.It has now 1.5 GB in memory and it works really good. I use it for home tasks, so good enough.I recommend this product."
2,Not very interesting,"I have a slightly older version of this book than shown here, with a different cover and a bit shorter too! I have to say that I found this book at times a bit difficult to follow and there doesn't seem to be any certainty about most of the results of treatments with Evening Primrose Oil. There is some useful and interesting information but that is all and the writer seems to think that saturated fats are the culprits of many problems, an opinion which, after having read quite a few books, I don't share.I promised my sister-in-law that I would give her this book as a birthday present but I think that I am going to look for one by another author, maybe more updated too and have a quick look through myself to see if I might be interested in ordering one too! This said I do think that Evening Primrose Oil might be something worth trying!"
4,Not the BEST but good enough,"To be honest, I didn't use this book until two days before the AP test. I did well in class and read every single page of the 1150 page textbook. I was already using the 5 steps to a 5 AP for Biology so I decided to get it for World history. But I must say, I didn't like the organization of the information and felt like it was jumping around a lot. I read the entire review book but did not take the practice tests. Yes, I got my scores back and I got a 5 on it. So.. I don't know if the review book helped me or not because I already felt like I knew all of my information. But if you feel like you're not ready, I would double up on the review book. Preferably this book and Princeton Review. The best word of advice is to pay attention in class and read your textbook."
1,Does not fit BlackBerry Pearl!,"This says that the case fits the BlackBerry Pearl 8100. It does not, the case is way too big! The phone floats around in the case."
3,"Not a Cellet, good case though","This case is NOT a cellet original as the picture shows or as it says (which is why I give it 3 stars) but the case itself is made of good quality for the price, now don't expect it to last a week due to its price but it'll last you a while, like years while. I bought this case for a Motorola SLVR L7 and it didn't seem to be a perfect fit. Any phones about the same size as this, don't buy it... Look for a better one. The case fits longer than the phone is and a little bit wider too. But its just spacious if you really want it. Overall, not so great for the Motorola but might be for you"
1,I would rate this item if I received it from the seller. I kept getting the wrong item. After a while I gave up.,"Just never got this item from the seller. This probably is not the proper place to put the comment about the seller, but this is all Amazon provided."
1,SUCK ASS,I bought this thing for my Motorola SLVR and doesn't fit! The thing could hold 2 of them inside! I actually went to a swap meet and bought a leaver case from a Mexican guy that fits like a glove and it cost me $6.
1,TOO BIG,"THIS ITEM WAS ADVERATISED FOR A BLACKBERRY 801, THAT'S THE REASON I PURCHASED BUT IT IS TOO BIG. IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT..... BAD ADVERTISING!"
4,good for the price,"i really like the case, and yes it is not a perfect fit but i knew that when i got...this is a multi phone case and yours may not fit perfect either so instead of a bad review just buy a different one....now if you want a replacment case with a great price then get this one.... i would buy another one if needed, but it seems well made and it does its job, it protects the phone..."
4,cold war tale,This is a good story about the British Navy after WWII in the waning days of the empire. I enjoy all of Mr. Reeman's books
4,Royal Navy,"Another classic sea story by Douglas Reeman. Taking place at the end of the British Rule in Asia, it is a first rate book. Mr Reeman writing always keeps you wanting more and this novel is no expection. A joy to read."
4,An enjoyable read,"This book is well worth the purchase. Written in standard Reeman style the storyline is slightly different from his usual but as always the hero wins out despite the odds. Mr Reeman's knowledge of things nautical is as ever, super."
2,Deja vu,"First of all, Bantam Books should hire a new flack to write the book jacket blurb. This one gives away too much of the plot describing events that occur up until page 400. Secondly, the book is too long at 600 pages. This length dissipates suspense. You know the villain won't be caught because you've still got hundreds of pages left to read. Mr. Koontz is is dire need of an editor...snip out a few adjectives here, a simile or metaphor there and voila...a shorter book. Also, the technique of having several main characters with alternating chapters describing their adventures was used to better effect in STRANGERS. Reading this book was a chore...not a pleasure."
3,Disappointing,"I have always found Dean Koontz's storyline and writing style compelling.Unfortunately, with the past few novels he's written, it seems he has begun the path of self-absorbtion displayed by Steven King. The story is interesting, if a bit undigestable and the style of writing wordy and distracting.Please go back to the clear, compelling storylines, Mr. Koontz, you have an amazing talent which I have followed since 1978. I miss getting lost in your books. To be honest, I will still look forward to your new creations, in the hopes that you will return to your original method.With much respect."
2,Not impressed,"I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers. But this story is just way too slow. Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again. I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner. About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading. I just couldn't get into the characters. I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel."
2,My last Koontz book for a while......,"I have found Koontz to be a masterful storyteller in all of the books that I have read by him (Phantoms, Watchers, From the Corner of His Eye, Intensity), but this book was horribly and unnecessarily wordy and cumbersome. The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided. Pray that this book comes out as a movie, b/c it will take you MUCH longer than two hours to needle through.Wanna read a wonderful book? Try ""The Weight of Water"" by Anita Shreve....it's wonderful!"
3,Not his best work.,"Let me say first of all, I love Dean Koontz. That being said, this was not one of his best books. It drags on, and could have been a lot shorter. I stuck it out til the end, and I'm glad I did. I love how he brings all the characters together. The ending was great. I love the message the story gives. I also love the way Koontz brings dogs into many of his stories. Can a dog really bring us closer to God? I think it just may be possible."
1,drags on and on and on...,"This book is almost too painful to listen to...I thought it would be a great thriller because it's Koontz, but sheewwwwwwwwww.The desrciptions of everything are long and drawn out, the characters, with an exception of a few are unbelieveable, especially the dog. I can't take it!It's pretty bad..."
3,One Door Away From Heaven,"My first Dean Koontz. Pulled me in immediately. Story within a story each a book of its own but the joy ride is as they come together. Couldn't wait for the next part. 13 tapes, lots of involving story telling.Full of suspense Reader is a supurb story teller."
4,Imaginative and Different,"Overall, I thought the book was very good. The story was unique and interesting. The characters were well-developed. It was sad to read about the little girl's home situation, because so many children do have unfit parents in real life. In fact, the book's plot can be described as an interesting combination of fantasy and reality. The ending was somewhat idealistic, but I guess it had to be after such a depressing lead up. The bioethics theory profiled in the book is very scary, as there are people who actually think that way. Hitler was one of them. In summary, the book is definitely worth reading. Koontz is an extremely gifted writer. Even his bad stuff is good, and this is one of his better novels."
2,Rather Spacey,"Wonderful prose as usual. A very slow read for me compared to his other books. It was like watching a grandfather clock, tick - first protagonist - tock - villian - tick - 2nd protagonist... Felt like the same situation was told over and over. The last 100 pages moved quickly."
2,Hard to get involved in this book,"This book started really slow and it was hard for me to get in to. It took me several months to complete this book as I kept putting it away and reaching for others. Finally about 75% of the way, I was determined to finish this book and was glad I did because the ending of the book was much better than the beginning."
1,Time is too short...,"I gave up at Chapter 33. Dean is telling an interesting story but he's taking waaaay too long to tell it. The descriptions and similes are becoming a labor--page fillers. I've lost interest in the unbelievable characters. Worse yet, I no longer care about the characters. I know as much about Micky & Leilani at page 269 as I did at 69 only now I'm no longer interested. Slow torture. I must move on though I absolutely hate not finishing something once started. I will wait for some other unsuspecting Koontz fan to give away the ending."
1,One step away from the window,so that you can easily throw this garbage out there somewhere. Listed the number three worst book inz Koontz catalogue (1. False Memory 2 the Taking)Hmm. Bad Koontz books are recently on rampage
1,"Fans of the 'old' Koontz, do not bother with this book!!!","Where is the old Dean Koontz? This book is really weak compared to his earlier works. It is really slow, and takes forever to develop a weak story line. I found myself not caring what hapenned to any of the charactures, tough to get through when you have a 600 page book! I am not good at giving up on a book and struggled through to the end hoping that it would have some merit. Sadly it does not. The last 100 pages or so finally ties together the sub-plots but even then just does not make exciting reading.I really feel that this time he has taken the 'dog' theme way to far. In this book a special relationship between an Alien boy and a stray dog is just plain silly.All in all, a 1* story that could have been written by a high school student. Come on Dean, we know you can do better!!!"
4,"Good, but he has better.","Although I enjoyed this book, it is not one of Koontz's greatest. That honor would have to go to Watchers and Strangers. Still, all in all this was a very good book, with interesting characters and a great plot."
5,A home run!,Great plot. Not predictable. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I am really getting into this author and love his stuff.
1,Big disappointment,"I see that I'm not alone in thinking this is not one of Mr. Koontz's better books. It is too drawn out - I kept saying when is this going to get interesting? I am a huge fan, so I did bother to finish it. I agree, the older Koontz is better stuff."
1,On the wrong heap,"Being a complete stranger to Dean Koontz oevre, I was thoroughly misled by recommendations of other readers. Placing this author anywhere near the likes of Stephen King is doing a bit of a disservice to people with a minimum of taste. I don't want to get into the kind of hidden agenda and personal hang-ups that seem to motivate this writer, as they are really his problem, but they concoct a story that never once manages to create even a hint of credibility or interest. Some of the worst fears of Puritan and Paranoid America are being fed here & to the members of his parish this might well be entertaining; is there no way to seperate these kind of authors from the serious writers?"
1,One too many Koontz books,"This was my first and last Dean Koontz book, so maybe I'm not an objective reviewer. But I was completely underwhelmed. I found it boringly overdescriptive, entirely too many points of view for me to care enough about the characters individually, and that whole dog thing at the end was a little too precious for me. Like, in the end it all comes down to dogs. How disappointing."
4,One of his better stories,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Koontz... I didn't LOVE this story but did like it a lot. The ending was sorta predictable, warm and fuzzy, but the story was quite a trip and the narrator is ver good. If you are wanting a good solid Koontz story this one won't disappoint!"
2,Read another Koontz book!!!,"This book was really difficult to finish. All the action is compressed into the last 1/5 of the book. And so much information is given at the end that would have been so helpful in the beginning. You would almost have to read the book a second time to really appreciate some of the things that happen in the beginning. Also, having four separate stories that don't merge together until the final chapters was very disappointing. It was a really frustrating book to read and I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Slow and tedious,"I have always enjoyed Koontz and his books, but this is too long, and wordy. In paperback it was 681 pages, it could have been done under 400. It is a rambling and tedious book to read. While I felt I should put it down, I skimmed it, and still got the story. I am one who could have easily put it down at any time. I guess a great author gets his name, and then can write anything and it will be a best seller."
2,One Door Away from Heaven,"I have read many, many Koontz books...can't ever put them down, however, this one is not very well written. It is EXTREMELY choppy, bouncing back and forth with no real story plot. I am 1/2 way through (has taken over 2 months) and there still is no rhyme or reason to this book. If you love Koontz, I think you'll be disappointed. I was. My husband is almost done with the book and says it doesn't get any better...."
3,Patience,"The other reviewers have already written most of my thoughts.However, IF you do decide to read this book, DO NOT give up after page 168 or so. Persevere! It's worth the effort.I only rated this book a 3 because ... Can't say because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Once I got 'hooked' which took a long time, I had to read it to the end.Sorry to be so vague; I wish I were a better writer."
1,One Door Away from Heaven,"I usually love Dean Koontz's books, and can hardly put them down. But...this book I actually threw in the garbage! The story was so depressing, that I actually felt sick inside! And...it just drug on and on, and I could not figure out WHAT the story line was. Not for me. But..I am still a Koontz fan, and will go on to the next book!"
4,Koontz is evolving into a writer who cannot be classified,"I know a lot of people are not too happy with the way Dean Koontz's writing is changing from pure suspense/murder mystery to, well, something else. But I love it! His books are becoming richer and more complex like a fine wine. I like the way he blends the supernatural and surreal with themes from real life.One Door Away From Heaven was a very satisfying book - the villain was just as evil as any he has ever written, the heroes just as good (and funnier), and let's not forget the dogs! Koontz writes about dogs in a way that is so real I can see their grinning faces while I'm reading.I also like Koontz's no nonsense opinions about such modern concepts as self help psychology and bioethics.I highly recommend this book!"
3,Disappointing,"This was a disappointing effort if you ask me. First of all, the story dragged on interminably and most of the plot was very predictable. And the ending? Well, give me a break! I can't comment on how stupid the ending is without giving it away, but suffice it to say that Mr. Koontz's idea of how the world could be saved is just amusing, not inspirational. I have been a Dean Koontz fan for many years. Watchers is still one of my all-time favorites. But his last couple of efforts have not been up to par in my opinion."
3,Dissappointing Ending!,"I have only read a handful of Koontz books, they were all great. I loved Cold Fire and False Memory the best. This book was interesting, but not exciting, a little boring. However my major complaint was the ending. Leading up to it in the last few chapter was a page turner, but the ending left me wondering why the heck did i waste my time reading through this book. It's just ok. Not at the least, one of his best."
5,Book review,"Book was in good condition. Not new, but in almost new condition. Delivery time was reasaonable and the price was excellent. Thank you!"
3,OKay....,"It was okay. I kept waiting and waiting.....and waiting for the big climax. Ugh, I've had better."
1,Didn't hold my attention - story boring,I read about half the book and started skipping ahead until there was nowhere to skip. I found the majority of the story boring and a waste of time. the kid was the most interesting until each chapter became a repeat of the one before.
2,It was okay but I probably wouldn't read it again,"I have dualling opinions about this book.On one hand, I found the characters unbelieveable, some of the plot to be too contrived, and sometimes just plain silly.On the other hand, I liked the forum of a fictional novel to explore real issues of significance to all of us. It got me thinking about how easy it is for a society to accept practices that benefit the few and eliminate personal choice and how easy it is for our goverment to support these practices.I liked the fact that our hero was flawed and not who you would expect, and, as always, D.K. makes us believe in the power of family and our animal friends."
4,One Door Away From Heaven,Some Parts were a little unbeliaveble but overall a very interesting book.
2,One door away from boredom,"I have read most, if not all of Dean Koontz's novels and have loved just about every one of them. However, I found this one the most boring of all and couldn't wait until the end. I usually can read his novels in a short amount of time, but this one I found hard to pick up night after night. Nice try, can't wait for his next one, hope it's better than this."
4,Why the grudge against bioethics?,"As usual with Dean Koontz novels, I have enjoyed this one very much. However, I don't understand his portrayal of bioethicists as modern-day Nazis. As with any field of study, bioethics has its extremists. But saying that all bioethics teaches murdering the weak in favor of the strong is like saying that all Christians advocate the murder of abortion doctors.After doing some research of my own, I found that bioethics wrestles with ethical questions regarding such diverse topics as living wills, pain management, human cloning, and embryo research. Opinions on these subjects vary widely among bioethicists. They are not like the evil fascists portrayed in Mr. Koontz's book.I realize that this is a work of fiction, but Mr. Koontz supports his portrayal of bioethics in an author's note at the end of the book inviting the reader to learn more about this field he finds so troubling. So I did. And now I'm wondering where he got his information."
5,A Masterpiece!...This novel has it all!! Thanks Dean!,"This novel is the absolute best of Dean Koontz! The story is plausible, and the characters are very defined.This is not however, a ""monster"" story as ""Phantoms"", and the like. It's a story of a very loveable little girl, who has the wrong type of mother, and a terrifying stepfather who is the ""monster"" in thistale. I'd like to personally thank Mr.Koontz for this great read!I have to admit,though, that my Golden Retriever ""Jodi"" thought that Curtis's dog, ""Old Yeller"", was the hero of the story."
2,More than one door actually ...,"Either Dean Koontz has been replaced by a computer or he's forgotten everything he ever knew about writing suspense novels. A potentially great storyline (bioethics) is smothered in overwritten eccentric characters, stupid subplots about aliens, superintelligent dogs etc etc. Dean my advice to you is to get a good editor ... Still why bother with such inessentials as a coherent plot, believable characters and genuine suspense when the DK name will sell millions anyway?"
4,Second time around,"Dean Koontz has been one of my favorite authors for some time. It is hard to find a book of his that I haven't read before, and I bought this one thinking it was one of those unread ones. Well, I read it before, but I enjoyed it just as much the second time around."
4,Good read,It is Good read. Nice to have a change from Odd. Look forward to the next book. Hope it's not too far off
5,Jeff,"As always, an excellent novel by my favorite author. Excellent plot, excellent twist. I couldn't put it down. The characters come immediately to life."
3,entertaining,"I really enjoyed 3/4 of this book. I thought that the characters were engaging and the storyline engrossing. However, I was disappointed by the ending. It was too obvious for me. I'm not sure what I expected. Anyone who has read more than one of Koontz's books, knows how they all will end..."
1,"Lame, boring, very poor result",I used to be a big Koontz fan. But most of his novels these days seem to be the result of an attempt to be profound. Lots of meta-physical mumbo jumbo.Bring back the action!What a waste of my money.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was disappointed in the plot, in the flow and in the way that it failed to keep my attention and demand that I continue to read. This is not a typical Koontz book.It's most redeeming quality is the fact that it is written by a literary master. Koontz' artistry is top-notch. His storytelling ability is eloquent and humorous. I laughed out loud more than once.Yet I still found myself wishing that he'd kept it more succinct. The only reason I refused to put down the book is that I wanted it to be over -- to learn what was found one door away from heaven -- hoping that it wasn't another 600 pages in this tale.Die-hard Koontz readers may want to avoid this one -- you'll be disappointed. It is fun to see him tackle another genre, I guess, but it was painful."
4,He's baaaack!,"I have been a long time fan of Dean Koontz, and have read just about all his books. Over the last couple of years, he seems to have lost the edge he had at the beginning, although his writing style has continued to improve. What I'm trying to say is that he had lost the ability to make me HANG ON to the book and be completely unable to put it down...until now. I couldn't wait to turn the page and see what happened next. It's been a long time since I felt that way about his work (sorry, Dean) but now I'm excited again, can't wait for the next one! I was somewhat surprised to learn that these bioethics jerks really exist. As someone who works in healthcare, I plan to learn more on how to shut the door in their collective faces."
5,Koontz just getting better!,"I have read, without a lie, all of Dean Koontz's books and I am thrilled at the new direction is he taking. I highly recommend others to open their minds and read this book without expectation.His character development has improved over time, as has the depth of his story-telling. Even though I enjoyed his earlier works, I found them to be simplistic and very predictable. With his newest books, this one and ""From the Corner of His Eye"", Koontz is building more memorable characters and layering his stories.He is not just giving us ""horror"", but showing us that the true horror resides within us.I found myself caring about each of the characters in this book (with the exception of the nasty ones) and hoping that the outcome would be favourable and positive - I was not disapointed.I give this one 5*****"
3,Not His Best,"It took me longer to read this novel. He went into great depth about a lot of things that I found boring. He kind of rambled on throughout the novel. He's telling the story about 4 different people (main characters) and he keeps switching back and forth between those, which I found distracting. Also he went into too much depth about those 4 characters before they finally got together. I really like his older novels better.It's still an entertaining book and it's still Dean Koontz.You read it and decide."
3,"Good, but not TUGTI-Koontz's Best","""One Doorway Away From Heaven"" [ODAFH], is not, in my opinion, one of the best works to date from Mr. Koontz nor is it the worst to date.The reason I adore Mr. Koontz's works so highly, is because in 95% of cases he has gripped me in the first few pages. He always manages to describe the characters over the course of the story instead of spending clumps of pages in description as many other authors do.In ODAFH, he seems to do the same in a seemingly longer manner. Read if you will, but I was way through the novel before I was hooked. As per the norm, however, I was unable to put the book down.I still have hopes the TUGTI-Koontz (The Uber God That Is) will finish the Christopher Snow series. Maybe Orson will meet up with his Cousin Einstein.As is I look for a large print version of my favorite book, ""Watchers"".All in all, I would have voted this 2 stars had that option been given to me.Regards,Scott"
2,Short story gone crazy,"I read this book and toughed it out til the end, because it came recommended by someone who usually has the same taste as me in books. Slow plot, some minor suspense, and a poor ending. SPOILER: I was very mad after reading the entire book to find the reason given for the alien coming to Earth was to save the planet by, of all things, teaching them to love dogs. Seriously?"
2,Disfunctional Story,"First, I love Koontz works. But...This one stank. I forced myself to finish it. It started very slow. There was way to much family disfunction for my taste. It was unbelievably disfunctional. And I did not really like any of the characters, even the dog and the boy. Especially the disrespectful little girl.Wait, there was one character I liked. It was Rickster. He was pretty cool."
3,AND ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE TRASH CAN,"I can't believe that they even released this book. It took so much effort to get through just the first half!!! Then I put it down to read something that was actually interesting, picked it up again, tried to finish this book, and failed....there was just nothing interesting enough going on to hold my interest. And Koontz is such an absolute MASTER at writing!!! I have been a fan of Koontz since the early 80's...for over 20 years, he's the best around, and I NEVER thought that he would let me down so incredibly badly as to write something like this. It's just a bunch of elements culled from his past books thrown together in a hodge-podge mish-mash of mildly interesting events. Whoever wrote that this is one their favorite Koontz books obviously hasn't read his other books because NO ONE in their right mind would praise this book over ANY of his other writings."
2,One Door Away From Unbelievable,"I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do?"
2,Early disapointment,"I never read anything by Koontz, and apparently this was a bad choice to be my first. I read only a part of Kindle sample, and simply could not continue. Mr. Koontz: one does not describe a precocious 9-year old by describing an adult, then declaring her a superintelligent child.Sigh, another bestselling author on my ""don't touch with a ten foot pole"" list..."
1,disappointed,"this book is sooo boring that I can barely finish it. I like Dean Koonze a lot but this book is a huge disappointment. Seems to me the book is a hybrid of his former works, like phantom + the dark river of the heart(the alien assasin group), from the corner of his eyes (the alien boy Curtis), seize the night (the dog), etc. I am happy I borrowed the book instead of buying it!"
2,Who's missing from the lineup?,"Well, let me start by saying I've read almost every other book that DK has published to date and am a BIG fan. However, this was a long and drawn out story with so much going on that it was confusing compared to his other works. As to my review title ""Who's missing from the lineup?"" lets see...we have a handicapped little girl, a drug addict mother, a serial killer step-father, a drunk, an habitual lying old lady, a washed out private eye, TWO former vegas show-girls, and space aliens etc. etc. everything but the kitchen sink. No, wait, i think a kitchen sink WAS in there somewhere. WHEW! I was glad when it was over.I'm still a fan, but it almost was like DK threw a little of everything into the characters because the story line was so [bad].Looking forward to the next book in spite of this one..."
1,"The pic in the back tells us his dog can read, but write?","Im guessing his genius dog wrote this book.I am a huge Koontz fan, so I feel guilty not giving him a good review, but I just cant honestly say good things about this book.He over details every single atom and cell on every object in the book, which gets old by page 2.Im beginning to think he writes all children as witty, smart allecky geniuses because he doesnt really know how they speak.Dogs eat their own waste, lets stop making them geniuses. (I loved Watchers, but enough is enough)The ending is one of the worst Ive ever read. I read 680 pages of detailed drivel, and the last page, 681, still didnt deliver any punchline."
4,Has problems but intriguing nonetheless,"Ok, has serious problems with dragging in the first several chapters. I actually put down this book and came back to it later. What stuck me though was even though i had to come back to this book a second time i remembered the Character's perfectly, and that is the reason why you will fall in love with this book, you can relate and be fasinated at the same time with all of the characters in this book. Inspiring?? Of course, Frightening?? Yes but only in Koontz's sad potrayal of a man who is obviously completely lost himself in the grace of this world and what that can really mean. So parts did drag, but the characters are fabulous the mystery is intriguing and the horror is horrific, this all adds up to a book well worth the time it takes to read."
1,Not his best work,"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan. I have read Stangers and Watchers at least 5 times each, and have loved many others. The debth that is usually in his other books is not here. The characters are not as well developed, and I finished the book still waiting for things to happen. Pick from other Dean Koontz books, but this one was poor."
2,BORING!,"What a waste of time! None of the characters were fleshed out enough to make me care about any of them. Too many storylines going on at once, with none of them really explored fully. The only time it got interesting was somewhere around tape #10, where the main villain's beliefs on bio-ethics were discussed. Skip this one!"
3,Slow Story Line,Story starts off very slow. I did not get interested in the story until chapter 45.Koontz spends to much time talking about some of the key characters in the first half off the book.I would recommend if you skip the first 44 chapters.Not one of his best books.
1,Simply dreadful. But some diehards will adore it.,"Formula Koontz: take an intelligent dog, a couple of morose people with big problems, an exotic premise, the imminent threat of our times, and what do you have?More or less, about 10 bestsellers.Okay, okay, sometimes a person plays the part of the intelligent dog. Happy?I don't think Mr. Koontz has changed. I think I have changed. What once was fresh and unexpected, even quirky and delightful, is now just Koontzification. It comes with the landscape.The last Koontz I liked was _Sole Survivor_. Possibly because the overtone of loss resonated so deeply with me at the time. Let's just leave it there and not bestir those old bones again.Goodbye, Mr. Koontz."
1,"Koontz has stumbled yet again into boring, preachy drivel.","I think that this will be the last Dean Koontz book I will buy. I have over 20 of his books. I used to find him exciting and easy to read. Of late, however, I have found his books are no longer exciting in the least.There is virtually no plot in this latest offering from him. It also contains his most annoying character yet. An alien boy who wonders around saying inane things. Too much of the narrative is taken up with Koontz complaining about the shape the world is in, the evils of Hollywood, and the corruption of Politicians.And worst of all, what used to make Koontz novels such fun to read is an interesting sicko. There is none in this book. The sicko we do get is not fleshed out anywhere near enough and is just ludicrous.For those of you who have never read Koontz, steer clear of this. I would suggest you read Mr Murder, Dark Rivers of the Heart, and Watchers."
3,A bit longer than it should have been,"I've come to the conclusion that Dean Koontz is a good writer with everything except for endings. This book is no exception.The ending wasn't ""bad"" but it wasn't great and was a little lackluster considering the rest of the story.The main story had me completely enthralled and kept me up a few nights. I really liked the characters and felt that the ever so tidy ending wasn't completely suited to the rest of the atmosphere.All in all- the story I give 4 stars and the ending I give 2 stars and since it was a long one I balance it out with and average of 3.5 stars.If you enjoy Koontz this is worth a read but be prepared for his little happy bow-tie endings."
5,Carole,"I have read nearly all of Koontz's books over the years and enjoyed all of them, but this one is outstanding! I have barely been able to tear myself away from it. In it he balances horror with science fiction and brings in true emotion and gains the readers empathy with the characters. After reading ""One Door Away from Heaven I have come to the conclusion that Koontz is like red wine - gets better with time."
4,"Not his best, but still very good","I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews ODAFH is getting. I personally found it to be an excellent story. This one had some of the most interesting characters Koontz has ever developed, and a generally interesting plot. The ending might arguably been a little cheesy, but hey, this is Koontz we're talking about. And if there's one thing Dean is good at, it's painting an image of all the evil and horror which resides in this world with us, and then illustrating how the resolve, determination, strength, and principles of strong individuals can overcome that evil. In that regard, the ""feel good"" ending of this story is not much different than many (most?) of Mr. Koontz's other works."
4,One door away from insight!,"Beautiful, but emotionally 'de-spiritualized' Michelina Bellsong; her name an anathema to her soul; struggles to disassociate the spirituallity of crippled Leilani Klonk, the 9 year old girl staying in a trailer next door, with her own.Micky soon finds that the cruelty bestowed upon her as a child, though painful, has very little in common with the murder of a brother!A fantastical journey through the paranormal to the otherworldly, via insanity and rapture!This book will give you faith in humanity, faith in your self and a beatific peace within yourself that we all lack!!"
1,One of his worst,"I am (or was) a Dean Koontz fan but the last 2 books were just verbal non speak. This one ""One Doorway From Heaven"" is nothing but an attempt to impress with overuse of adjectives. The story is nonsensical and makes little sense and has no flow to it. He in constantly describing things that have no relevance to the story."
4,A quick read,Easy to read and hard to put down. As usual Dean Koontz characters are exciting and you want to keep reading to get back to the character in the previous chapter. I love his style and how he brings the characters together. Always a little horror a little love and compassion it is a good mix.
4,Most Enjoyable,"As all Dean Koontz novels do, his villians are very evil and strange. Preston has a very sick mind, but is very clever and intuative. He would have succeeded if the Hero did not come to save the day. The hero a boy, but not a boy who made some strange but loving friends. I would like to believe that I am also strange, but loving. Which I believe that Dean Koontz is too. At least where his books are concerned. I do love that he included a dog, as he does in many of his books, which I also love. All in all the characters make for a most interesting read. Just like in life, all the strange and loving encounters make for a most facinating and fulfilled life. There are so many lessons to be learned in his tale. I considered a must read on the Dean Koontz list."
2,Just Too Many Characters which Dilute a Good Story,"Sometimes I read a book and think, ""this should have been two or three separate books"" and that was the case with this Koontz novel. With so many distinct characters running around and so many plot lines whipping every which way, the story just gets too thin in places to be a good read. With me, it's always hit or miss with Koontz. Some of his work is my absolute favorite reading material (""Watchers"" especially) and other times I come across something like this. If only it had just been about the special boy, or the crippled girl, or the Private Eye, or the psycho Phd... but unfortunately, Koontz crams them all in and thus takes a bunch of good stories and creates a crummy one."
2,Should have been left with the Editor.,"The only reason I finished this book (and that took some doing) was to see if possibly the end might make more sense than the book did. Very boring, very scattered. It was as if a chapter was written, forgotten about and then re-started again. I had just finsihed Odd Thomas and was completely delighted but this book goes no where real fast. Good luck if you choose to read. I rarely give away or resell books, but this ones on the block."
5,Just the right size!,"I had to get this and couldn't find no where! Got my truck painted and the man fixed the bent in fender JUST A SMALL SPOT where the Antenna fell in place, now I have what I needed but only thing is I had to buy the Antenna and kit but only needed a certain look and all for the Fender"
2,Not that good,"This book is a collection of a diverse set of Goya's works exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It includes a lot of Goya's famous works but not enough. If you want to see more of Goya's works, look else where. This book doesn't contain enough and that is why I gave it 2 stars."
2,Flimsy,"The handle is way too flimsy. The silver section is separate from the black, and it continually pops apart when mixing heavier items. The handle is hollow.I would prefer a single piece handle of a solid piece of material."
2,TOO BENDABLE!!!!,"Stick with an old-fashioned wire whisk. The silicone is so bendable, you can't use this piece of c ... junk. ;-p"
2,Disappointing,"This item worked very well at first, and had all the features I wanted in a small audio system. After about 8 months, though, the CD player quit working. All the authorized service centers in my state are more than 1 hour from my home. This product might work for others, but for me it was unsatisfactory."
1,Bad fit,"This cover does not fit on the phone properly. The back cover is fine, but the front cover is almost impossible to get on on one side, and once it's on, it keeps popping off. Very diasappointing."
2,Music for the bagpipe but not by the bagpipe.,"Very disappointing for those who love to hear the Great Highland Pipe. Most of the songs have too many instruments to count, and if the pipes are playing you can't hear them clearly. If you are wanting to hear bagpipe music played on the GHP, look elsewhere."
4,An excellent reference book for anybody who sews.,"I recently purchased this book to use as a reference guide for a quilt I am working on. This book is fabulous! It includes step-by-step instructions on just about every aspect of the quilting process. The book also includes well illustrated pictures along with the instructions, which enhances the books value. I did feel however that the book did not explain quilting terms as in depth as I would have liked. Despite this, I feel this book should be added to the library of anyone who does quilt, or plans to quilt in the future. Had I read this book before quilting for the first time, my first quilt would have been a less daunting process. If you don't have this book, get it soon!"
4,Parts of Quilting Bible,This book also a good book.some of the contents are also presented in Ouilting Bible.This book is very good for beginners.Thank you.
4,Great for the price,"Love the watch! It feels comfortable and seems to be able to take abuse well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had a timer on it. It does have a stop watch, but I miss having a countdown timer that beeps when it reaches zero. Very happy regardless!"
1,TOO MANY GREATEST HITS COLLECTIONS,"I cannot believe George is coming up with yet another Greatest Hits collection (Particularly after his ""50 Number Ones"" last year). Not only is it unneeded, but expensive, and hard to find. The way to go for George fans is to get yourself the boxed set, and you will NOT need this waste of money."
4,Some things never change,"I just found this book used and loved it.It's about the head of a company facing mandatory retirement by his own policies. It's very light hearted but at the same time, it shows that some of the issues we deal with now (not enough savings, too much spending) have been dealt with before.Like many other 50's and 60's novels, it also shows business from the viewpoint of people who had actually worked in business. His insights (especially when he's trying to figure out what to do AFTER he retires) rang very true. It was a very enjoyable quick read.More importantly, it has made me want to find other books by Streeter.Thank you."
5,don't judge a rapper by his ceo!,"For all of you who thought bad boy was gone, your wrong. Need we forget that while we were bumpin' 112's anywhere and Faith Evan's that Puffy produced them? But anyway, Rob is a tight MC, part meth, part big. He can take marginal beats (like on down the line joint and pd world tour)and turn out a pretty good song. While doing my initial preview of the album, these song sounded bad, but after a complete listen thye were pretty tight. Give him a tight beat (muscle game, br, life story) and the result is incredible. I wish there wasn't so many guest mc's, cause rob doesn't need them. He usually embarasses them. I personally have no problem with (got both albums), but don't make the mistake of not buying life story cause he produced it. You might think it's alright in the begining, but trust me, it'll grow on u quick."
4,4.5 STARS,Great album. Black Rob is awesome. I very occasionaly like east-coast musik but this is great. This album is definitely worth getting.
3,somethin was missin,"aight i got my handz on this hot new joint from black rob. all the online reviewerz r givin it 5 stars and even the source thinkz it'z an awesome album. i open up the package pop the cd in and expect a whole great album. i was pretty much wrong.only a limited amount of hot jointz appear on tha album. there were a lot of backup rnb singaz which i didn't really enjoy hearin. there wuz some dope stuff on here tho. some tight trackz include espacio, whoa!, thug story, and br. the rest is semigood. i expected a lil more out of this album tho. evry1'z comparin it 2 biggie so i dunno what to think. biggie was a much smoother lyricist. this is still the best thing bad boy'z put out in a really long time. black rob tried but i wasn't feelin it."
5,BLACK ROB LIKE WHOA!,"This album is tight! Along with Beanie Sigel, Rob, despite being around forever, has delivered an album that bangs from beginning to end. If you haven't heard the lead single, Whoa, you live in a cave... but that's not even the best song on the album, everything is tight- BUY THIS AND THE TRUTH BY BEANIE SIGEL AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY"
2,Not what its hyped to be,"Yes, Whoa! is a phatty song, BUT how are his others ? I heard Whoa! on the radio and i was sold. It was fast and fierce and since this is his 1st cd,I thought this cd would be the same. Its not. Most of it is slow-paced beats. 13 out of the 15 songs feature other rappers that take up most the time on the track, and it has 6 skits/interludes. I paid my money to hear Black Rob, not the Lox, Puff Daddy, or anyone else. Some people I havnt even heard of like Joe Hooker, Mario Winans, Mark Curry, Carl Thomas, or Cheryl Pepsi. I think that if he didnt put out Whoa on the radio, this cd would of been a flop."
4,NYC rule rap like WHOA!,"NYC has represented again! Black Rob just turned out the best rap album so far this year. For all you southern punks who feel like you control rap, cop Rob's album. Once again he represents with joints like You Don't Know Me, Espacio, Lookin' At Us, Can I Live, and I could just keep going and going. Thanks Rob for dropping the dope album. To the real rap fans that listen to rap for lyrics and beats, not for the ice the artists make or for some sing-song ish, then this is the album for you. If it wasn't for NYC, this rap ish wouldn't be living on, NY baby, NY baby!"
4,Bad Boy's last hope,"I wasn't expecting much out of this album since it's off the Bad Boy label (Puff Daddy, Ma$e). It's actually pretty good though - ""Whoa!"" has to be one of the hottest tracks out this year. There's a varity of beats on this album, which is good for a Bad Boy record. Bad Boy is dying out, with the retirement of Ma$e, The Lox switching record labels, and B.I.G. dying, but Black Rob shows hope for this struggling label."
1,bad boy needs to go sit in the corner,this album was a waste of money its one of those you borrow from a friend to record one song (whoa) even Cee-Lo couldn't save this poor excuse of an album.
4,bad boys newest star,"This is a real good cd. Life story is a great song,whoa,lookin at us,can i live and thug story are also good. BR might be able to save bad boy"
2,Bad Boy Records about to Collapse,"After hearing the joint ""Whoa!"", I expected a decent album from Black Rob, hoping he may be the savoir of Bad Boy Records. However, this is some of the worst hip-hop I've ever heard. When real MCs like Guru and Rakim dis wack MCs, they're talking about rappers like Rob. Wack production is obvious, so how can anyone say production is tight? For example, that one joint where Rob is talking about his mama has a wack beat, an uncatchy chorus, and, of course, wack lyrics. Basically, Puff Daddy needs to give it up, because in a few years, Bad Boy Records will be gone for good. After listening to this, I won't expect anything good from Black Rob or Shyne in the future... Peace"
3,It was alright,"I heard the album a little late,but it was ok. I liked a few tracks here and there like Life Story,Lookin At Us,BR and ofcourse Whoa! The thing that really annoyed me the most were some of the lame beats and guest appearances. First off Puffy like we know sucks deeply. And to have a guest feature with Lil' Kim is totally.........STUPID!!!!!!! A little more talented rappers or just a little less guess appearances and Puffy would've made things much better. But you know,can't please everybody."
3,another bad boy blunder,"black rob...the newest of the quickly decaying bad boy family. this cd is barely making it. BR himself has lyrical skills, with a rough, rugged sound to his voice which makes it unique and appealing. but the production of the cd is shotty. all the beats sound the same and are filled with samples...thanks to puff. the lousy production takes a lot from the cd, which makes it listenable, but not very appealing. track#2: WHOA, is bangin', but at the same time it wasn't produced by puff. hey puffy, stop holding your talent down with your non-creativity."
2,Bad Boy is a sinking ship!,"What is going on with Bad Boy? Craig Mack left, B.I.G. is dead, the LOX have defected, so what's left? How about a stale rapper who has the CEO's no-talent girlfriend on his album. The first single Whoah was really good. I like Buckshot's production and Black Rob shined on that joint. But alas, that's the only good song on here. The rest of the album is booty. Jennifer Lopez is as annoying as ever and does nothing to save this sinking ship. Bad Boy, your short era has ended. Join your nemesis Deathrow Records.To sum it all up in one word... caca!"
1,Terrible,This album is terrible. Puffy messed up agian. His bad luck continues with the release of this album which was supposed to be released two years ago. I wonder what's next.
5,one of the BEST albums ever!,with Life Story B.R.'s recorded one of the greatest albums of all time and overall as a rap star he's highly underrated. this album is hot as phuck
1,Whoa,I gave this Lp a One Cuz I realy think we have a one hit wonder here.I listen To that one song Whoa it's hot but thats the only song I can stand.
3,For Black alone,"Dears,fellow folks of Black Rub,how are u guys?Men i have for long had his sound,i dont know if he has a new album.Well i like him so much and i will like to have his mails in my email box.I'm also a musician and would like to play with him.I will be looking out for his mails in my box.Black dont ever give up coz yoou are a very good musician.Folks go check out track 8 of true life story(you dont know me),thats very good of him.We need need him to come up more than he was.HAILS TO YOU BLACK RUB.From a very good fan Alex(Alexzy).Thanks Alex"
3,Stright,"It is ok. I only like about 4 song's out of 20. I wouldnt buy it but some people love puffy's work so I cant give him less then 3 stars but I would really give him 2 Stars if it really came to honesty, but the song Whoa is a hit! Thats the sh... Some advice if you love the song buy the single."
1,Flat AS BAD-BOY,Black Rob hit really well with Whoa! but the rest of this disc is forgetable.also way too many Guests to Show off his skills.There's Too Much Puffy Vibe going on.there is a Reason why this Album was in the can for so Long it's Not very Good.Bad-Boy has Been thru and this is it.
3,Black Rob is good but he needs a new label,"As i read in a previous reveiw ""dont judge a mc by his ceo"" and it is the truth, Black Rob is the one who makes this album hot not puff daddy cause he aint good at all...Black Rob is a true rapper but this cd didnt really appeal to me, maybe its because everyone was telling me how good it was but it was really average, it was much better than all the other bad boy cd's but it just wasnt as good as i was told it was..."
5,BAD BOY STILL THE BEST,"This album is amazing. The lyrics and beats are both blazing.Life story,espacio,thug story are straight up classics.Anyone who says bad boy is over is wrong(R.I.P the lox and ruff ryders).Rob is the new king.Just watch out for lil,kim, J.MAFIA,puff,rob,dep,curry,hooker,d-dot,shyne.... to bring bad boy more cream."
5,Black Rob tha Krayziest,"Yeah this album is bangin'. Almost every joint on here has a great beat and fly lyrics. I epecially liked tha song with The Lox kalled 'Can I Live?', even tho I don't even like The Lox. Life Story iz a great song(#2) and Black Rob kan really tell tell storyz in rhyme form. Puff Daddy kan lick balls....but other than that this cd rocks and everyone should pick it up."
3,"Ok, but not great","Galco quality has really gone downhill. Handgun would not fit in the holster. Not a major problem as there is a tension adjustment screw. But the screw had to be backed out all the way before the gun would go in or come out. Solved with a longer screw. The weight of the leather (thickness) is about half as much as their older holsters. The holster does not slip on or off the belt with ease. I'm thinking it's because of the thickness of bluejeans and heavy leather belt and that I can solve this issue by taking some of the plastic off the locking lug of the holster. The paddle it self is a bit narrow allowing the holster to flop around on my hip. Hoping that after some break in time things will loosen up some overall. I would probably buy another holster from them but only in a store where I could examine it, not on-line."
3,road vibration issues,install with care so as not to put it upside down. i 've had to adjust it in the opposite direction! and i'm not certain if it was installed well enough as it vibrates quite a bit and leaves me nauseated in busy traffic!
1,Not good at all....,"The only GOOD thing about this phone case is that has a little weather protection and in some situations protects the phone from shocks/drops and that obviously looks cool.The swivel adaptor collapses after 2-4 months of usage, so it makes the release button useless, the phone case will release itself with just a little pressure in the bottom, even if you don't push the release button, the case will fall if you are getting out/in of your car. Think twice before you buy it."
1,No wires coming out,"Picture shows wires coming out of the fan, while the ones I received had none. Am not able to use. Apex was nice and gave me a full refund, but I am still without fans.Panaflo High speed 92mm 3 pin fan FBA09A12H"
4,Great for the price,"For the price these speaker stands work great. Although they don't seem ver stable, they seem to be holding up pretty well so far (of course, I don't have a dog or any kids). You will need to purchase some double stick tape or velco in order to mount your speakers to the top of these stands. The stands appearantly didn't come with any. I improvised by using electrical tape and it's been holding fine. Take my word for it, spending an extra $50 for speaker stands will really improves the sounds of your Home Theater System.Of course there are other stands out there that look better, but they all do the same thing. I price isn't an issue for you, then by all means go out and spend your hard earned dough. I wouldn't recommend any stands lower than 34"", as it's perfect for ear level when sitting down to watch a movie."
4,"Great Buy, plus a nice addition to a nice system",I couldn't afford the other stands on the page after spending so much on the system itself so i purchased these and absolutely love them. They were affordable and are very complimentary to the system and its surroundings.
4,tin tan,I grew up watching all Tin Tan movies and this is one of them... this is a good movie for everyone in the family.
5,Shining Jazz Icons,"""Jazz Icons"" are exceptional, as well for the quality of the films as for the quality of the sound and thebooklet. Series 4 Box Set is equal to the preceding one. A delight for jazz afficionados !"
5,You'll never regret doing this workout!,"This video targets the areas women tend to need help with: the hips, thighs and buttocks. The music is very upbeat. She is amazingly easy to follow, so you tend to not get all mixed up with the moves. Kathy uses fairly simple moves that are very effective. I have all of her Walk Fit Tapes that I use on the treadmill, but this tape gives me the help I need to get into that swimsuit. She is so motivational!!!"
2,Item never arrived,"Item never came. Seller shipped, but it never arrived. I received a full refund as soon as I informed the seller. I'm sad not to have received the CD, but happy that I didn't have to hassle the refund. Thanks"
5,VERY GOOG AND FAST STEP WORKOUT,I enjoy that step workout and I usually practice 2 or 3 times in a week.It is very well explain and very good to burn calories.Very good and fun.You can practice it and see quickly results.bye
5,Great Workout,When I first started this video I couldn't believe how difficult it was. I thought I was in good shape! Now I'm much better at it. It was one of my goals to not feel tired after completing the first segment. If you are looking for an aerobic challenge this may not be it because it is short. But it does get your heart rate up especially if you really get into the movements. I'm always sweating as if I've worked out for 45 minutes after the first segment. The second segment is a series of squats and she ends with a segment of toning on the floor. Overall a great workout.
4,Love it!,"This book is insightful without being preachy. The cover and title make it seem as if the content is based on humor, but it really provides some great, realistic tips for those of us who are new to management roles. I would recommend this book to both new and experienced managers."
2,Not a lot of practical advice,"I was excited about this book, as its subject matter addressed an issue I've struggled with recently--transitioning to being someone's boss.I was disappointed. It made a lot of solid statements, but didn't give a lot of good advice on how to implement their suggestions. For example, the authors stated that many women cry at work, and one should never be seen crying. But the book offers no suggestions on how to prevent yourself from crying as a reaction to difficult suggestions, right after saying it is a problem a lot of women face. Same with handling the difficulty of giving negative feedback to someone--they say it is a hard thing for many people to do, but don't offer much in the way of how to overcome that difficulty.Hopefully someone else will write an improved version of this, with real, tangible advice."
4,TO BE ABLE TO A GOOD CHICK-IN-CHARGE,"As a new Chick-In-Charge, after reading this book, I was so relieved that I am not alone in my troubles, because when I started to work as a boss, I felt that I was about losing my mind and others could achieve to manage with all these managerial problems but I coluldn't!! But to read this book helped me to see that all these problems are common and normal; most importantly I could find basic tips to solve them and gain a different point of view.I read many books to improve my managerial skills, to be able to be a good boss ; but being a woman boss is a different thing and you are under very big risk to be a bitch at workplace!! If you don't want to follow the bad examples and if you want to be a nice boss but to make your staff work most efficiently, read this book!!"
3,Common Sense,This book would be good for someone new to the job world but for any one else this book is basic common sense. I really expected more from the the description of the book was written.
2,shortest book EVAR!,I Fortuntly got this way under priced for i was dissapointed to see it only had 30 pages ..not including index in it.othe content in the book is good tho but these days itself out of date..understandable as its a 1997 book.
3,"I didn't measure, but . . .","I suspect as many others have said that the length was significantly shorter than stated. I ran out. Again, though, I didn't actually measure."
2,Not worth for money,"I read many reviews about this product but i didn't think its that bad and ordered one. Now i'm very desprate about it. First, it's not 100' long, but only 92'. Second, the wire is half a copper and half aluminum. And other thing is that it's not really a 14 gauge as expected. I'm thinking about to buy other one from another brand."
2,Nowhere near 100 Feet,"I bought two spools of the Metra 14GA speaker wire and although its terrific wire both spools were not 100 feet. One roll was around 85 the other around 90. I needed 200 feet I got 175. I had to buy another 40 feet from Home Depot.Metra should relabel their spools to say ""approximately 100 feet""."
3,Doubt it's length,Cut it up to connect speakers. Could not measure the lenght beforehand but doubt it was anywhere near the 100 feet as indicated on the label. Closer to @ 60 or 70 feet.
3,How can the length be so far off???,"It's 14 ga. wire as advertised. Well jacketed with thick, clear poly and it came in one piece. Problem is, that one piece was a little less than 90' long, or 10' shorter than advertised. I guess if we keep writing about it here and tell Amazon customer service about it, dummies (like me) will stop buying it and maybe they'll either get a new supplier or just tell them to stop shipping less than advertised. The thing that I don't understand is, who measures this stuff? Do they just stand there and guess how much is on each roll? It can't be a metric/inch conversion thing, some people are complaining about being shorted 30'. Someone is deliberately shorting these rolls. Has anyone, honestly, ever received a roll with more than 100' on it? I didn't think so."
2,It's not 100 FT. It's aluminum speaker wire.,This wire is not copper and its not 100 feet but it is 14 gauge. I believe one strand is copper clad while the other is just aluminum. 14 gauge copper clad speaker wire from RCA or Philips is a better buy because they are actually 100 feet and both strands are clad in copper and they are also cheaper in price. I would not buy this product again.
3,Got 90 Ft,"The wire is rather nice, better than I expected. It is easy to distinguish between the 'red' and 'black' cables as the wires are color copper and silver. Not sure about the performance yet as I just installed it yesterday. It is definitely 14 Gauge, but is not even close to be 100 Ft long. I measured the length that I needed to cover for two speakers 45 Ft for two speakers. to my surprise and after cutting at 45ft the rest of the cable was exactly the same length! this is 10Ft less than expected."
2,heavy duty wire but 10 feet short,"I thought that by now Amazon would have insisted that this company ship the advertised length of wire, but it came up ten feet short when measured."
2,2 stars isn't for the quality...,"...it's for the amount you receive. The wire itself is good quality and the different color wires makes it easy to keep track of + and -. The problem is the amount in the spool. Like everyone else, I too was shorted a little over 6' of wire.If you do order this product, just make sure to buy ~20% more wire than you plan for. That way you have enough to finish the job."
3,"Not 100 feet, otherwise fine.",Purchases two rolls. Just over 90+ feet each. No complaints other than not being 100 feet so 3 stars.
3,good but short,"I probably would have never measured this wire if I hadn't read other reviews. But i unspooled it and it was only 89 feet. Thats okay for me since I was only going to use sixty but be warned. Decent quality wire, two colors so getting the right end wasn't an issue. for the price it was a good deal but be warned it will probably be short."
3,What happened?,"I'm going to be put in the doghouse for saying this, but what kind of weird book is ""Betsy, In Spite of Herself?""When I was younger, I loved the Betsy-Tacy books, about when the two were little girls, but recently, when I read this one I just cringed! Betsy, the sweet imaginative child, has turned into a flirt as she enters high school--and her sister Julia is far worse. This was a big disappointment. I truly pity Tacy, having to put up with Betsy.Oh, Tacy...remember her? (She doesn't have a major role in this book.)I would still recommend this to the Betsy-Tacy fans however, just to complete your collection."
3,steel ring,"was kind of disappointed with this ring. did not really look like the picture. steel is not shiny like silver, ring has a dull finish. will not purchase like products in the future."
5,a musician's opinion,"There are many children's albums out there featuring big production and big names so I'm pleased to hear a little guy doing such a great job.""squirmy Wormy"" is an excellent collection of original songs and melodies featuring different animals that should really please the kids.""I love my pillow"" is an instant favourite and will really help in getting those kids to bed!Hat's off to peacock studios and a great children's album!"
5,Squirmy Rocks!!,"Squirmy Wormy is my children's favourite CD. They are 2 and 5 and simply love listening to these delightful, ear-catching tunes. I'm stocking up for Christmas gifts and can't wait for the next CD!"
4,Great first impresion with my Clié,"I have had Palm powered PDAs since they were called Pilot, and the Clie is definitely the best bet on my 5 minute ""cost-benefit"" analysis done before buying it.I sure feel that the price is lowered by the 3 months warranty, which for sure kind of makes me think why?, but I hope it will last more than 3 months and 1 day.The size, color, and SW makes it really great to use. The camera is very handy to take low res pictures, not compared with a normal 2 or 3 meg camera. Since carrying the camera is normally the most important part, this one gets to go everywhere.In short, I am very happy with it, and still recommend it. Although the Clié desktop and Clie viewer could use some integration, but aside that ""all good""."
2,Great camera but ...,I bought this item after an unsatisfactory purchase of an IPAQ. I have always loved the Palm but go through them like bic lighters so I tried the HP. When that failed (must be me) the Sony looked like a great choice. Set up was a nightmare. You have to install each program separately and it took a while. I could not get it to sync with my Outlook although if I would have spent more time on it I am sure it would have worked. While loading the programs I plied with it a little and did not like it. The scroll bar in the middle was awkward and tough to move. It is not like the palm based products I am used to. I did not like that no cradle only a cable was included. No case only a thin cover that snaps on. The Clie is $300 and merits more quality accessories. The camera is great though and would have been a welcome feature had I kept the Clie.
1,Too Large for LP Covers,I was very disappointed. A friend of mine purchased a couple of these as Christmas gifts for me. These frames are oversized for a standard LP cover. There are gaps along the boarders depending how gravity lets the Album Cover sit inside. There is movement. A frame similar to this should be a press fit for any LP Album Cover. The LP should not fit sloppily inside the frame like these frames do. I saw least expensive frames at my local Expect Store for $2.00 each. I bought 2 of those for my daughter and the albums fit nice and snug. They were Christmas presents and they looked beautiful.
2,Quality a little disappointing,"The frames from Container Store were a little low on quality. The plexiglass in all cases (2 sheets per frame) were dinged or nicked near the edge, as the plastic is rather flimsy. I had to exchange one of the frames directly to the Container Store because it was unusable. The rest I managed to hide the ding, plus they frames are going in the basement. Even for $13, I'd expect the plexiglass to be of a little better quality. I also wrote a note to the container store about it..."
4,Display those Vintage Records!,"It was easy to put my vintage record into this frame to put on display. The thin black edge works well with my decor, and doesn't look cheap."
4,Good frame for the price,"I received this frame as a gift, and I'm happy with the quality and look. The frame comes with four spring clips, a spring clip for hanging on the wall, and two clear plastic panels. The panels sandwich the album, providing the ""glass"" in front, and protecting the record from the spring clips in the back.I was able to put an album in its original clear plastic sleeve in the frame without issue, and it fit well -- no visible gaps between the album and the frame.I'm very pleased with the fit and finish of this frame, and will be buying more."
4,earlier is better,this is one of VanDamnes earlier movies---and one of his better ones-----the story line is fair and his acting is good
4,"Great movie, lots of action.",I've seen ths movie several times. But despite that I would watch it again and again. The first time I saw it I was suprised how good this movie is. It is just a great movie. This movie gives us a glimp of J.C's emotional side. You need to watch it.
4,Van Damme in a tear jerker!,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. Great fight scenes, some corny little emotional moments, but definitely recommended for Van Damme fans!"
2,Cool!!!,"I remember seeing this film with my uncle of mine. I really didn't like the film to much. The film wasn't really like his other 80's films. The story line was really slow not much of an action movie. This movie was more like a ""ladys soap opera"" rather thin a action movie. IMODont get me wrong there was acouple of parts in the film that were awesome but still the movie wasn't that good. I dont suggest picking up the DVD unless your a big collector on Vanddame stuff."
4,An Oldie but a Goodie! Good movie for those new to Van Damme films,"Whether you're a Van Damme fan or have never heard of him, you'll appreciate this movie. As always, there's plenty of kickbutt action but it also has lots of heart and a good story-line. Van Damme usually plays good guys (with the occasional evil twin), helping friends and family out of tough situations. The same goes for this film. He sacrifices his body through underground fights to financially and anonymously help his widowed sister-n-law and nephew. Great fighting scenes. Funny sidekick. Good acting, by all characters, pulls you into the story. Bottom Line: Golden Oldie that will win you over!"
5,An Exciting Movie!,This movie has a little bit of everything. One of the better Van Damme movies that I have seen.When he deserts the Foriegn Legion and hits the streets this movie never loses pace. His career as a professional street fighter is very entertaining. Van Damme fights every kind of villain you can imagine. The final battle when he fights a true killer is very exciting. This is Van Damme at his best.
3,Buyer Beware! No widescreen version - Bad Video Quality,"I am a big Van Damme fan. I was excited to finally get this widescreen edition. Not only is widescreen not available as described, my old vhs tape has better video quality than this.For 7 bucks I'll keep it for now and replace it when it (hopefully) comes out on Blu Ray."
3,where's the letterboxed edition,"5 stars for the movie but only one star for the company releasing it. Much like ""timecop"" another terrific Van Damme movie, there's no letterboxed edition. Why do they do this to us? The horror...the horror..."
4,HIS BEST,"This is the first movie I felt Van Damme really acted in. You know the plot from the other reviews but, his acting ability really came out here. I actually felt he didnt want to keep fighting but he had to for his niece and sister-in-law.Punch after bloody punch came in the climactic fight scene, where a giant of a man beats him down without mercy. Then he realizes he has to do it. He rises up on sheer willpower and gives his all for freedom! VAN-DAMME... VAN-DAMME, VAN-DAMME!"
2,Good Van Damme,This is not a good film. However it is an entertaining film. The plot is as follows: it is a Van Damme flick. The plot is always the same. In Lionheart Van Damme's excuse for kickin butt is that he has to provide for a family his junkie brother has left behind. Since he has no other skills to fall back on(acting included) he fights in small time pitt fights for L.A's rich thrill seekers. This films saving grace is that the action is pretty good. It is a mindless film that action lovers can enjoy.
3,3 for a Van Damme movie; 1 otherwise,"Warning: SpoilerI have to give credit to the fact Van Damme's character didn't sleep with the main female character. That earns a star in itself.The other two stars are based off the fact this is a Van Damme film. He has a low batting average when it comes to some great movies, and I'm not counting ""box-office"" hits. That means squat!Too much punch, pause, kick, pause...it's hard to believe the opponent couldn't see the attack coming given a few seconds warning. There is a somewhat plausible plot and a few good fight scenes; Damme's first under the bridge and another time in a pool.There is quite a bit of ""F"" words and they basically come from his so-called manager. Enhances the stereotype.If you want a good early Van Damme film go for ""Bloodsport"" or ""Cyborg."" Otherwise, def. check out his latest works, ""In Hell"" and ""Wake of Death."" The latter two are rather surprising."
5,Another amazing van damme movie...WHAT A SHOCKER!!!,"Let me just say....this is one of VAN DAMME's cheeziest but amazing movies other than kickboxer, bloodsport, and double impact.. But cheezy is good in this case... Van DAmme escapes from a military base in North Africa...and arrives in L.A. To visit his dead brothers wife. Since he is broke when arrived to L.A. he has to fight in order to make a living....!!! WHat a great Plot...so far.... Later on in the movie he becomes close with his brothers wife...and stays in L.A. The Action is pretty cool with good fight scenes....IF ur a true Van damme Fan you would buy this even if u never saw it....I mean just look at the cover for goodness sake!!!"
5,The Summary..he he he,"To me, this is my favorite JCVD movie of all times. maybe its because he lost it in knock off or because of all his problems. This movie is absolutely ""THE BEST!"". Take it from me- i have a webpage dedicaded to this guy... Jean Claude Van Damme really is ""The King Of The Jungle"" in this flick. If i were you, i'd buy it and watch it till i broke out in tears! visit my page and be sure to sign the guestbook!!! -bye"
1,THIS IS NOT CLASSIC CANNED HEAT!!,"I am writing this from memory, since I have long since dumped this bad CD. Don't believe the glowing reviews!! This is not the band you think it is. It has no resemblance to the classic, or later Bob Hite lineups. There is no electric bass. You get my drift. It's poorly recorded, and very dead sounding. It's not Canned Heat!! What they are doing is putting down progressive/blues rock music. They are saying, we know we are inferior white artists, but we learned our lesson, and we are now doing THE REAL THING. At least this is what I feel, right or wrong. Go get Savoy Brown. They are even better now than their classic stuff. Read my Amazon reviews."
3,Human sidelight on Shostakovich,"Limited as it is in scope and ambition, the book brings out the eminently humman side of Shostakovich through correspondence dealing essentially with matter-of-fact everyday matters. Glikman seems to have worshipped Shostakovich, who evidently valued his friendship highly.A pleasing volume with interesting photos and ample notes to fill in the background, it will be appreciated in particular by aficionados."
4,Awe Inspiring Vocalist,"This is one of the best Contemporary Christan CD's out there. With her pure vocals and subtle background music this CD is a refreshing change from today's gimmickly driven pop music. From the moment you listen to her you are drawn to her natural talent. She seems to have that something special that can't be described. There isn't a song on here that I don't like, and that's very rare for me. There is a very well put together mix of both upbeat and slower, more emotionally driven songs. My personal favorite track is, "" That's the Day"" All I have to say is Denise is one of those artists that you should definitely keep your eye (and ear) on"
5,Only a Whisper Away ... from a Smile ...,"Denise Rosier's new CD combines rich vocals, excellent instrumentals and strong writing to create a collection of songs that will become a permanent resident in your CD Changer.In today's market where you are lucky to get one or two good tracks for your 15 bucks, it's refreshing to find a CD that offers so many great tracks. From the hopefull but intraspective ballad of the title track, to the upbeat hooks of ""What in the World"", no one should be disappointed with this purchase.If we don't see Denise at next year's Grammys, then there is no justice in the world ..."
4,Russell Pro Cotton Pocket Tee,These shirts are now made in Pakistan. the quality has slipped a little but they are still the best pocket Tees I've been able to find.
4,Dog Sure is great for very ill older dog,I gave my 11 old Rott X this product when he was very ill and could not keep anything down on this stomach. He loved the taste and didn't have a problem keeping it down. It also kept him hydrated while building his strength back. It's a little expensive but well worth it in the long run.
1,5 piece place setting Lenox Solitaire platinum-banded hina,"Wanted The Solitaire Ivory platinum-banded place setting, and what the site actually shipped turned out to be the bone color. I ended up being very disappointed that the order details I saw the company provided did not clearly list that the color of this china place setting they offered for sell and ship would be listed on the place setting box as being the bone color."
1,Negative 5000 Stars,"This book is so completely unfunny and uncreative that they should pay you to read the book! If I could give it a lower rating, I would."
5,Perez Prado is always great,"I have not found a Perez Prado album that I don't like. This one includes some great songs. The 11th song alone was worth they buy for me. If you have a chance to get any Prez Prado album, do it."
3,COSPLAY SAVES THE DAY,"I liked this episodic volume, as the individual stories referenced all sorts on anime in-jokes. There's a lengthy cosplay adventure, as well as a few digs at the cosplayers themselves.As with the previous book, you'll probably like some stories more than others, and that's part of the charm with an anthology title like this."
1,"Repetitive, redundant, monotonous, trivial, boring.","Each piece has about 1 musical idea... if you're lucky. Interesting textures, but that's about it. Any of these pieces could have been conceived by a 6-year-old."
3,"Bodum Chambord Shatterproof 8 Cup Coffee Press,",Have used the product twice. Worked as advertised - found it easy to clean.
2,This is not a good repair manual,"I own a motorcycle shop. This manual is for 1985 through 1998 Honda Shadows. The problem with this manual is that there are at least three (3) different engines in these model years. In particular, the 1995 Honda Shadow (VT1100C) is NOT well covered in this manual at all. The wiring diagrams are insufficient. It refers to a ""timing hole cover"" being located on the right side and then refers to the same hole being on the left side. It shows no routing, whatsoever, of the spark plug wires and to which coil they should be connected to. I will be buying a Clymer manual to replace this Haynes manual."
5,Very Good Condition,Book was received in about two weeks in very good condition at a great price. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
4,4 Stars to a 5 Stars Dj,"I would love to rate this compilation 5 stars, since Cattaneo is like god for me. But in this case 4 stars will do it. CD 1 is brilliant, only quality music superbly mixed. The smooth transitions between tracks (which have made Cattaneo so famous) are here at its finest peak. Cattaneo just makes us believe these tracks were made to be together (¡?). I loved it, though it had some weak moments (track 2, and 5). Don't get me wrong, they're not bad tracks, i just know Cattaneo has some hidden gems with him, that could work better.CD 2 dissappointed. it's good, well done, and mixed, and has 2 of the hottest tracks of the moment (Steve Mill's Lia, and Arachnofobia). It's a good cd, just not enough to rate it 5. I'll give it 3.5, for a total of 4 Stars.Overall a good buy. Money well spent."
5,Another excellent program from American Experience,"This was a interesting look at a man who was considered to be the most popular man of 19th Century America. Yes, he was a private man who was considered a failure until the Civil War, but it goes to show that it is never to late to be successful. Grant is a fascinating man, who had high moral standards, but was too trusting of people who he came into contact with not realizing that they may have ulterior motives. This caused embarassing moments during his presidency and what is worse it caused financial disaster after he left office. But out of the financial disaster came probably his greatest gift, his book, which shows how an intelligient he was."
4,You Get What You Deserve!,"If anybody knows something about the hood... it's got to be Wahida Clark. This book has its ups and downs, and some surprises. All in all, it's a great read! I loved the ending. Just be prepared to take a day off because you will not want to put this book down.--Pryncez"
5,I recommend Wahida,"I just love this author. Her storyline, characters, locations are all so real. Reading Ms. Clark's books is more than a good read, its an experience!"
5,WAHIDA,Payback Is A MuthaI just recieved Payback with your Lifeand I cant wait to read it.Wahida you are the bomb diggerty(old school)I loved the book I could not put it down. It took me 3 days to read.I loved it.You bring the heat girl.I am so glad that you are free.Whatever you put out I will read.Those sistas were off the chain. especially B that girl was wild.I was sad at what happened to her thro.But u live by the streets you pay the consequencesIt's sad I liked her she was scanderlous but she hooked her girl up at the end.I love your workThe book was great.Peace outChillin in New York
3,Was'nt what I was expecting!,This book was ok! I was expecting it to be a little bit better than what it was. The story was kind of all over the place and it had alot of unecessary characters. The ending was alright but it wasnt a shocker.so in a way I guess i was a little dissapointed.But am still a fan of wahida clark.
5,Dammmmnnnnnn!!!!!!,"Okay now, this was so good! Read it in one day!! You gotta read this one, it will have you hanging on the edge of your seat. The title of this book says it all! I can not wait to read what she has in store for her next novel!!!!!"
4,Everyday I'm Hustling,"Brianna and Shan have been friends since they started to bloom. Like night and day, Brianna is ghetto fabulous with a knowledge for scheming the grimmest people on the block. She uses her head and sex game to get the lifestyle she wants no matter who she has to knock off to get it. Will her past catch up with her in the deadliest way or will one last scheme finally put her on top?Shan is average beauty but has the body to turn a lot of men out. She doesn't get caught up in the game and only like to get her money the legit way. Constantly reminding Brianna about her scandalous ways, will she forget that you can't through rocks at a glass house?Just when you think the fire has calmed down, Wahida brings you some more fire. Do not get fooled by the mass of characters that are throughout the book, somehow everyone and everything connects."
5,Raw,"Wahida didn't hold back one bit with this book. From the sex, killings, relationships, and prison life it was straight raw. If you like a book where it gets straight into details, then this is your book. I love books like this and highly"
5,OMG . !,"Okai First Off , WHEN SHADEE HAD B DRINK THE BLOOD FROM HIS FINGER I SAID , DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN HE SCANDLOUS .. ! lmao thiss book is juss HEARTLESS . ! iiGive It 4O Starss Handss Downn After Yhew Read Thiss Readd ( PAYBACK W.yO LIFE ]"
3,It was alright,"This was an average book.. It doesn't stand out or anything like that.. but it was a good read. Not as good as ""Thugs and the Woman who Love them"".. Now that was on point. But I would definetly recommend this to others"
5,HOT !!!!!!!!!!,This book was so GOOOOOOOOOOOOD--I loved it and couldn't put it down until I finished.
3,Only Okay!,"This is my first Wahida Clark book and maybe I should've started at her 1st release instead of Payback. The book was only okay to me. The story started off introducing two best friends and I didn't gravitate to either one of them. Instead of making me care about them, Ms. Clark went on to introduce more characters and she lost all direction. The foundation was shaky and the storyline a little too simple for my taste. I wish her the best and I will give her another try."
5,I enjoyed it.,"Wahida Clark is never predictable, I can tell you that. This book is heavy on allegory and mystical realism, light on heavy-handedness. I felt a sort of Faulkner-esque stream of unconsciousness going on here that only the more educated readers here will pick up on.But let's get to the point. Shall we? Clark is about bringing sensibility to this crazy world of ours. Perspective, people! It's all about perspective!And if you haven't figured that out by now, well then I weep for you. I'm getting all like Captain America -- because I'm weeping tears of freedom! For you! Because these colors don't run! And if you don't like it you can take your sorry behind out of this country to somewheres that tolerates dissention and improper thought -- like Paris or France. But I won't sit around while you badmouth the US and A. You hear that!? Huh?!"
3,Extremely Disappointed,"I loved Wahida Clark's last two books so much that I rushed out and bought this one. I was extremely disappointed. The storyline started well but ended horribly. The characters were undeveloped and there were too many love triangles. The end left you wondering what the hell you just read. There were alot of unanswered questions leading you to believe that that couldn't possibly be the end. I still have love for Wahida and I cannot wait for part three of her first book, but this one was a bust."
5,Payback is a Mutha- It definitely is!!,"This book is so good, that I had to buy it for my collection. Every friend that I have has read it and they love it. They even suggest it to other people. Even my friends whom say that they don't read ghetto books--love it. It is a must. It has a twist that any other book never has or had. It suprised me. I read that book in 5 hours flat. It almost mad me want to start smoking cigarette because I knew I had too many things to do that day, but I couldn't take my eyes off of that book. Would I do it again. Hell yes!!! I would even read it backwards and forward just to see if I missed anything. Go get it!!"
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"Okay I'm so confused right now and after reading this book. Wahida the story-line was off the chain, but there was toooooo many names to try to remember and trying to do so I lost focus on what was going on. I've read books where authors have used many names, but dam*.But on a good note I would still recommend this book to people, because you are in fact a very good author.Hurry up and give us the next book to 'Thugs'."
5,Payback is a Mutha..I know that's right!,"This book by Wahida Clark was on fire! I could not put it down! Brianna and Shan both had a fair share of drama in their lives. Brianna was real scandolous and was always willing to set someone else up for that mighty dollar. Shan was more laid back but ends up getting involved in some stuff that makes her a little shady too! Payback is a mutha and Brianna will learn if you play with fire you wil get burned! This book is hot! It's got enough drama, sex, and twists and turns to keep you up late at night reading!! I look forward to her next novel..it's a shame that other author stole her former title b/c that other book was garbage!"
5,Evocative and gorgeous,"I had heard another artist interpret Lecuona before listening to the composer play his own work. I was reminded of how much I enjoyed the music when I was reintroduced to Lecuona through the BEFORE NIGHT FALLS soundtrack. Not all the artists on the soundtrack have albums that are so thoroughly listenable. Beautiful music, not only Cuban in background but with traces of Chopin, jazz, and dance. Highly recommended simply for Lecuona's virtuoso solo style."
3,Interesting but poorly edited perspective on American foo.,"I read this book very quickly--a sure sign that it was engaging enough. Still, two things bothered me: the author's concentration on the two coasts and the rambling and repetitive structure of the chapters. While Brenner admits that she has little experience of the middle of the country, that middle provides most of this country's food, and as long as Brenner is writing as a cultural historian, she should take the trouble to gain such experience. That's what research is!"
2,Brenner's autobiography of food,"Tries to summarize how Americans in the past century have learned to eat better, but could more accurately be called an autobiography. Most of her stories are anecdotal. She summarizes the influence of Julia Child's publishing of a French cookbook in the 60's, Alice Waters' emphasis on fresh ingredients in the 70's, and tons of anecdotes about the effect of an ethnic cooking boom in the 80s and 90s. But no real analysis of any of this. She cites Kellogg and the ""Food Science"" movement of the early 1900s as a reason for the public acceptance of poor tasting food, but there's no real analysis, nor is there anything other than sketchy hearsay about a rise in the quality and variety of the rest of the food Americans eat. Also would have been nice to objectively compare us to other countries a bit: maybe the French are eating better today too?"
2,Too long -- should have been a magazine article,"I was looking forward to this book, but was diappointed with it once it was over. I felt that too much of it was filler. Had she trimmed 200 pages she would have had a concise, facinating article on the development of American cuisine. Instead, it's watered down. This would have made a killer cover story for Food & Wine, Bon Appetit or Saveur, but as a book it's too ambitious."
2,Faulty,when using this in SD it worked fine but as soon as i got my HD tv the cable doesnt work in HD even though it was on the HD setting. So unless you want an unreliable product then dont buy this
1,defective,Standard AV cables worked fine and very convenient. My fiber optic audio out did not work however which was one of the main reasons for the purchase. NO INFO on manufacturers website about problems. Tried calling the support line and it just tells me the voicemail is full. No response from their tech support through email after 4 days of waiting. Just returning the item for a refund. Companies like this don't deserve my business. Everything with Amazon however was good as always.
2,Not his best performance.....,"I have some authority to comment here....I have seen Mr. Jones in over 20 live appearances, over his 37 year career! The taping of this particular show was not one of his best nights. I only give it 3 stars for the three songs he performed well on this video. Those are ""At This Moment"", ""The Boy From Nowhere"" and ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"". The rest of his show was not top notch. The sound of this concert was not recorded well either. I am looking forward to the release of his new DVD sometime next week. I have pre-ordered my copy from Amazon already. Leave this one behind... if you want some good advice."
5,Tom Jones at his Best !!,"This is a great video that shows Tom Jones at what he does best- live stage shows. He does all his great old standards and some newer songs also. He has a great rapport with the audience and such a stage presence he is wonderful to watch. His dance moves and sexy attitude just add to his charisma. I met him in person around the time this video came out (we stayed at the same hotel) and he was wonderful in person also. He stopped to talk to me, and has the same off-stage personna he has onstage. His smile is dazzling and his singing and stage moves are at his best in this video. One of my very favorites !!"
5,MORE FOR YOUR MONEY!,"THIS IS WORTH EVERY DIME!THIS COLLECTION ALLOWS YOU TO GET TO KNOW B.B. PERSONALLY. WE OFTEN LOOK AT A CELEBRITY ON T.V. OR AT THE MOVIES AND SAY ""HE/SHE'S GOT IT MADE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT TOOK FOR THEM TO REACH THAT LEVEL. B.B. WENT FROM THE COTTON SACK TO A CADILLAC AND THE REST IS HISTORY. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS COLLECTION!"
5,Fat Burning Classics,I was so excited to see this on DVD. I had the old fat burning workout on cassette and it was so worn that I could hardly make it out. The DVD is great!
4,"pretty good, but most stuff in it you can find online",Even though you can get most of the same info from this book that you can on the internet it is still a great book. I only ask when will they release the next one? if they are going to do another one.
2,"UGGHHH, so not realistic","This is NOT standing the test of time. Yes, Andy Garcia is wonderful, hot, and earnest, but Meg Ryan still sucks and the writing and plot of this are just not very realistic. Maybe when this was made it was edgy, what with her egging the neighbor's car but it really is not standing the test of time. The soundtrack made me cringe because it is not timeless. Meg's character just seems so fake and false. The only redeeming value is the oldest daughter's acting which is great for a little kid. Overall, I would watch ""Invervention"", ""Addicted"", or ""Relapse"" any day of the week. This just seemed so false and unmoving."
2,I want my money back!,"Before I read all the reviews here on Amazon, I would have given this book three stars. The world has the potential to be interesting, the plot intriguing, and sometimes I even like the characters (only sometimes, and mostly at the beginning). For an author's first book, it's ok, and the potential that the rest of the series will improve seems quite high.But! I have now discovered that this is not a debut, but a pseudonymous work by Harry Turtledove, who has been writing for at least 20 years. You would think he would know who to write a book that isn't flat as a pancake by now. I have never read any of his books before (not being overly fond of the alternative universe genre) and I certainly never will now.I want my money back! ""A brilliant new talent"" Judith Tarr says on the back cover. Well ""brilliant"" may be a subjective category, but twenty years is an awfully long time to be considered ""new"" in the fantasy genre. Talk about false advertising!"
2,Disappointment from Harry Turtledove,"Written by Harry Turtledove under a pseudonym, no doubt because of the poor quality, this novel is a re-tread of countless other high fantasy stories. I've read and enjoyed many re-treads -- some of them written by Turtledove, in fact -- but even if a writer takes a familiar storyline or tired plot device, he or she can make a new story pop by adding strong characterization or interesting nuances. Unfortunately, this book has neither and, sadly, ranks at the bottom of Turtledove's bibliography, along with his fantasy Civil War series (""Sentry Peak,"" etc.)."
2,Missed opportunity,"I picked this up with the hope that, as a three book series, it would have a rich story. After reading it, I saw that the outline of the story was much better than the final product. The premise of the story has great possibilities with a rich world to enhance the characters. The implementation however is dry and forced. The primary characters have been given the wisdom of age and the intelligence of a youthful scholar, yet somehow each has the depth of an old pizza. I was very disappointed, given the possibility that this story had, to the way it was finally developed in this book. After reading you will feel empty of the desire to read the next in series. I am not certain if it was an issue with the editor, because you can see flashes of great writing within this book and wonder what could have been."
1,Less than inspiring Writing,"Having picked this up when perusing the Cherryh section for the final book in her Fortress series, I find that I'm less than impressed. The writing is awkward the dialogue is clumsy and while I found some of the characters to be witty they more than disappointed me by the 5th chapter. Roc publishing must have thrown out it's standards for publishing when they decided to publish this series. The cover art is what got me and will probably motivate many fantasy fans to invest the 7.50...however I'm thinking of returning these books for a refund. I suggest Roc fire their current fantasy editors and pay more attention to publishing polished writers. I'll never judge a book by it's cover again."
5,Rock in their blood,"My pick for the one band capable of restoring credibility to this otherwise beige world of radio blandness. Having waited for a true torch-bearer of the classic Manchester scene, what a suprise to find the answer come from Atlanta - GA.This CD is brilliant, and it gets even better live. Thumbs up from the FreshTracks Crew in Chicago!"
4,Very Helpful Information,Helpful information on choosing a college. Both of my little sisters choosing from prestigious colleges used this book in the past three years. One is at Vanderbilt and the other is still deciding.
4,Excellent survey of the field,"An excellent survey for anyone contemplating doing research in this area. The authors make a special effort to identify the open research problems, what has been done to date and what there is very little of. This book will bridge the gap for anyone with a background in Molecular Biology that wants to build computer models for cellular and genetic activities. It is especially focused on gene regulation, but also covers other modeling areas such as diffusion. In reading this book, you will appreciatge both the good start this field is off to, but also the long way to go before a complete cell can be modeled. A great area to do pioneering work."
2,Romantic Jealousy,"this book was very informative...but I don't feel that it gave me what I was looking for. I was hoping to get more on how to turn jealousy around. On a positive note, it does give different situations and the aspect of the nonjealous partner - so in that respect, it was an eye opener. But I felt it didn't give enough information on how to cope and rise above jealousy."
2,Not useful to me,"This book seemed to be aimed more at other therapists than at average people. The language, though readable, was full of clinical terms that made the content seem less relavent to me. It gave numerous examples of how different people react to different situations, but never really specifies how to solve ""abnormal jealousy"". The book's sub-title says ""Causes, Symptoms, Cures"", but I found no cures for my situation. There was only stuff on how to deal with normal jealousy that is caused by situations that are likely to arouse that emotion in most people (like one person cheating on another).Yes jealousy is normal, I know that, it's a part of caring for someone. But how do you deal with someone who is very possessive? Who sees intimate relationships with others when there is none? This book doesn't deal with any of that. It's chock full of information about jealousy in general, but this book was of no use to me whatsoever."
2,PATHOLOGICAL JEALOUSY AND NORMAL JEALOUSY,"Ayala Malach PinesRomantic Jealousy:Causes, Symptoms, Cures(New York: Routledge, 1998) 303 pages(ISBN: 0-415-92010-8; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: BF575.J4P4715 1998)A psychotherapist discusses the many dimensions of conventional jealousy,especially as seen among clients.Sometimes jealousy is completely baseless and irrational.People suffer fantasy fears for psychological reasons,for instance when the 'rival' is long gone or even dead.She suggests various psychological methodsfor coping with pathological jealousy.The author believes that 'normal jealousy'may even be a healthy sign in a relationship.This book does not break any new ground,but it might be a place to beginfor readers who have read nothing on jealousy before.Better books on jealousy will be found in the following bibliography:""Best Books on Jealousy"".Search the Internet for those exact words.James Leonard Park, author ofNew Ways of Loving:How Authenticity Transforms Relationships."
4,Adorable!,"This is such a cute book - I remember getting it from the library when I was a teen! It's a bit of a time capsule as it was obviously written for ""the modern teenage girl"" in the 1970's, lesson: etiquette can be fun!, but if you look beyond the era it still gives good basic advice. I don't know what the target audience would think of it today so maybe best for '70s nostalgia... still you never know, your daughter might be open-minded enough to enjoy it too!"
4,"useful, but takes several tries to get the lids on","I wanted a set of small bowls and storage containers w lids that is microwaveable and machine washable. In that respect, this set satisfies my requirements. But, the lids are not easy to fit on, and that was even without food in it. I don't know how I'll struggle with the lids if I have hot soup inside... Also, I wish someone would make this glass nonbreakable and a little lighter so kids could use it too. I hate washing kids' plastic wares."
4,Great storage containers!,"I love these containers. They are microwavable and they do not have PVC (plastic), so they are much safer when using in the microwave. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the lids are a little hard to get on, but on the other hand, they provide a very tight fit which is great!"
5,awesome and no leaching!,"With all the recent worries over plastic containers, I decided to go back to glass. I'll never look back! These containers are wonderful! They can go from the deep freeze to the oven to the microwave and more. Bonus, even a klutz like me can't break these bowls. This is very important when one is walking through the company cafe, bumps into the HR rep, does a 360 spin on the nice, slick linoleum floor and launches her lunch through the air like an Olympic shot putter. Knowing that your spicy bean soup would not have shards of glass in it after this display is priceless."
4,Much safer than plastic!,I am slowly changing all my food storage containers over to glass instead of plastic. Glass is much safer to store your food in (especially when heating food). This was a great value and over all I am pleased with the set. A couple of the bowls have a slight odd shape to them which can make it tricky to get the lids on.
5,Can't go wrong with this product,"I've always loved Pyrex, and this product is no exception. I use this set constantly, and with my husband and son, who can't seem to find leftovers in the fridge unless they jump into their arms, this set is invaluable because they can SEE what's inside. They are the perfect sizes as well, and the covers fit tightly. So happy with this purchase!! I'd like to get a square set next..."
4,Storage is easy,"These pyrex bowls are a great replacement for plastic containers for being safe from chemicals that plastics leech during reheating; easy to wash, especially if one uses turmeric or paprika in their dishes; for being transparent to see what is in the bowls. The only trouble again is finding the tops. I wish they had made bowls of all sizes to have the same size tops. The smaller bowls do fit into bowls of larger size, hence they do take less space."
3,Nice except 3 flaws,"Solid products, but a few flaws:1. It's somewhat difficult to put the tops on.2. Microwave performance is poor.3. Those 4 smallest size bowls are not really very much in use."
3,Nice but too small,Don't let the pictures fool you. Make sure to relate the size because i was disappointed. The largest of the set is still too small.
3,pyrex lid,"After several use specially when one put the lid in dishwasher, it start to crack . unfortunately one can't even buy a replacement . I purchase Pyrex glassware for obvious reason that I prefer using glassware and with the lid it is easy to organize food in the refrigerator with the lid. Unfortunately , the lid cracked after a while and worst of all i can't even buy a replacement . Nowadays there are a lot of competition like rubber maid that make glassware. The lid look more durable so I am going to try it. Other inexpensive unknown brand also sell glass ware nowadays similar to Pyrex so if Pyrex does not improve it's quality of the lid then it is losing it's long time consumer.I hate to throw away glass but the lid is an important part of it's usefulness."
2,"Good idea, but needs help!","We bought these bowls about 4 months ago from Amazon. I was thrilled to have glass storage for reheating. However, as others have complained, the bowls have straight sides, so they don't nest well. They are now chipping on the edges and we've had to throw several out. It's past the Amazon return period.The other problem is that the box came with one less lid than needed.Find a better set. This one just has too many problems."
5,So much better than plastic,"After using plastic containers for years, these have been a wonderful change. No more stained/melted plastic form reheating things in the microwave. These bowls are very durable too, and clean up very well.My only gripe is how difficult the lids are to put on. However, I suppose the tightness gives them a better seal and keeps things fresh.Overall a great product."
4,Shipping was prompt,"We make good use of this set. Shipping was prompt and items are durable. Initially, the lids looked flimsy but you get used to it upon continuous use. Nothing big to complain."
5,Great product,"I was so tired of plastic storage containers melting or becoming stained with foods, or microwave damage.... I love these storage containers!"
5,"Best Storage, Great Price","I have used the small size of these to carry my lunch to work, and even banging together and occasionally falling out of my bag, they have held up remarkably well. The larger sizes I use for fridge and freezer storage. Great alternative to plastic, durable, withstand a fair amount of abuse. I have purchased an alternative brand, and the lids melt in the microwave and one broke when I was stacking them in the drawer - no impact, just one clinking against another, and it broke. I am going to stock up on the Pyrex."
5,Perfect for me and for gifts!!!,"Other reviews cover the goods of this Pyrex so I will just say that no staing and no upper dishwasher rack necessary sold me on it, my wife loves that it is so versatile and lasts forever if you don't drop it too much!! The best thing that we have found is that it is good to order a few extra for gifts, this can be useful as a last minute gift that men/women from college students to first time home owners will love and get a lot of use from."
1,Pyrex-Terrible Product,Good luck getting the lining back around the container after you've taken it out of the lid to clean. You have to stretch them to basically twice the diameter of the bowl and even that doesn't guarantee the liner will fit. And the liners will tear in two if you stretch them too far. Terrible product.
3,Good Quality,I was misunderstand when I purchase this item. it is 14 pieces rather than 14 boxes...So I was a little bit tricked to buy this set. But the quality is good.
1,That was short lived,"I can't even tell you how the lids fit. I never got that far. I opened my box while sitting on the floor and about 30 seconds later dropped one. Remember, I'm sitting on the floor, it didn't have far to go...and it shattered into a million pieces...it also chipped another bowl on it's way down rendering that one useless as well. I am seriously NOT impressed."
2,Poor microwave performance,"I bought these for microwaving but after using them there are numerous problems. The most disappointing thing is that the bowls heat up in the microwave, rather than the food. You end up with soup that is cold in the middle and warm near the edges, while the container ends up being very hot. Plastic beats this since plastic containers never heat up in the microwave and they always heat their contents evenly."
3,"Lids were VERY stiff at first, but they loosened after first close.","I was ready to throw these out the window I was so aggravated when I opened them because the lids are IMPOSSIBLE to get on the first time, and I wrote a negative review, but then I realized that after the lids are on the first time they are actually OK. They need to stretch a little. We will see if they last. I haven't used the set yet. It's a good deal if they work. The lids should loosen, FYI."
5,Great value for price,"I bought this set when they were on sale for close to 50% off. They are a great value for the price. I prefer glass to plastic for storage and reheating since it doesn't discolor with foods, and has no risk of releasing any harmful fumes.I regularly take them from the fridge straight into the microwave with no problems. The lids fit great, but warp a little but if allowed to heat-dry in the dishwasher. Otherwise, they are dishwasher safe. The bowls are elegant enough to be used as serving bowls in a pinch as well.Just remember that ""pieces"" include lids, so a 14-piece set is 7 containers and their lids."
3,Smaller than expected,"For some reason I was thinking the 7 cup bowl would be bigger. I measured it by pouring single cups into it and it topped off at almost 6 cups, false advertising?"
5,Nice set,I received this set perfectly.It looks good ..but the thing is u should handle these carefully as there is nothing to hold ...Other than that this set is nice and i got this for just 13 bucks..Its worth it.
5,Ultimate Storage!,"I am STRONGLY considering another set of these! I recently saw where they do not recommend reheating food in plastic containers, but recommend you using glass ones. I got rid of my tupperware and bought this set. . .LOVE it! They take up less room then the bulky tupperware, also they do not get the smells or stains like the tupperware do; not to mention being so much more cheaper as well. I RECOMMEND this item!"
3,tight lids,"lids are too tight, one of them was too much tight. dint like the lids much, i guess the new design of lids is not that comfy and simple. but oky for the price."
3,Missing Lids...,"I love pyrex dishes, and own many. This is the first and only time I have ever had an issue with their products. I only received 2 of the smallest lids and was supposed to receive 4. I have written to pyrex explaining what happened and asked them to send out the replacement lids. I hope I get the response I am looking for. Reading the other reviews I am apparently not the only on who did not receive the correct lids. Other than that the products are great. Very functional, durable and affordable."
3,Too many too small items,"The items arrived quickly, but after opening them, I was slightly disappointed. 4 out of the 7 bowls are quite small and therefore not as useful. I got it for great price so I will not return it, but if I was too buy them again and saw it in person first, I would hesitate."
3,"good containers, lids not so good","The glass seems fine, though I haven't used them in the oven. The sizes are pretty precise (so 2 cups is to the rim, not that it'll hold 2 cups and then still be able to use a lid). The lids leave a lot to be desired though. They're not air tight, or liquid tight. They're stiff and not terribly easy to get on. If they were silicone they would probably seal better."
3,legit,"The order arrived on time and quality was excellent, its functions and looks were completely the same as it was listed on web site's descriptionsHowever, if you microwave it, the pot becomes very hot so be careful not to hold it directly with your hand. Besides that, i have no complain at all"
5,"So great, I am going to order another set.",I was so tired of cheapo plastic rubbermaid containers I bought this. I couldn't be happier. I am going to order another set. The are perfect for storing leftovers or prepping for dinner. Love them!
1,be ware of the broken glasses,the one I received has 3 bowls damaged -- chips off its top edge. It is a headache to look for the dropped chips -- you do not want them to remain on your table or carpet.So be very careful when you open your package and take those bowls out.
5,A must have for any kitchen,"These bowls are great. The lids fit nicely, they are easy to stack, they are easy to clean, you can freeze them, nuke them, bake with them, these bowls do it all! In the future I will be buying more of them because I find them so useful."
3,Disappointed,"I am really disappointed with this set. I have finally had the need to use the medium sized bowls only to discover that the lids don't fit. They're just a smidgen too small. No problem with the large and small bowls, only the mediums. I guess they'll make good cereal bowls, but that's not why I bought them."
3,the lid are not easy to use,"The containers are good, the only concern is that the lid are not easy to use, especially when u want to fix them upon the containers."
4,Almost perfect!,"Haven't used the biggest size yet, but have used the medium and all the smaller sizes. The smallest are best for bringing lunch-sized portion to school and the bowls themselves seem relatively sturdy. My only mini-complaint is slight cracks in a couple of the lids around the edges (have only hand-washed the lids thus far), which are not enough for them not to work, but I am worried they are indicative of what's to come."
4,Good value and its PYREX,This was a good deal and I am enjoying it so far. The lids are a little stiff and hard to get on but other than that I really like this set. They go from the fridge to the microwave with no problems.
5,"Pyrex good for oven, fridge, micro","This item was easy to find, order. Delivery was in a timely fashion. The bowls themselves are excellent."
1,Cracked not long after purchase,The rims of these cracked soon after starting to use them. I bought them to heat up lunch in the microwave but I'm very disappointed. Don't buy these unless you like glass in your food.
4,So much better than plastic,I am so happy I bought this set. It was very enexpensive and I love using this everyday. I feel better about re heating in this. I only gave 4 stars because one had a slight chip. Nothing that will cut me but still not happy about
4,very nice,"lids are tight and leak-proof. very nice. using them in the freezer, thaw in the fridge and into the microwave ... like that"
2,If some lids are missing...,.... Amazon will not handle the problem but rather tell you to contact the manufacturer of this product.I received this product with several missing lids.
2,Could be better,3 issues with this product. Does not live up to the specifications.-> lids dont fit well on the bowls. It's a struggle-> bowl gets too hot when placed in the microwave for more than a min. Cannot even be touched with bare hands-> one of the bowls chipped in the dish washer.
1,Not good,Item returned for full refund. Pyrex not like it used to be. Covers didn't fit at all. I was very disappointed!
4,14-Piece Includes the Lids!,"I didn't pay much attention and thought that ""14-Piece"" meant 14 bowls. My fault. Otherwise, the quality of the product seems fine."
4,Nice clear bowls make it easy to see what's inside.,"Love the bowls with the lids, but find the lids a little tough to get on without spilling what is inside. They are tight and don't stretch very nicely over the bowls on the smallest bowls, but work fine on the larger sizes. Good for the price."
3,good product - but misleading description!,"We bought this set and are quite happy with it. However, we expected to find a set of 14 pyrex bowls, as the name of the product suggests. There are only 7 bowls, they count the lids as pieces! Surprised me.."
5,These are a kitchen must-have!,"Every kitchen needs a set of these! From now on, this is what I'm giving as wedding gifts! They easily go from freezer to oven, fridge to microwave. And though the lids are plastic, they are BPA-free, so I don't have to worry about toxins leaching into my food. They are super easy to clean and seem to keep food much fresher than their plastic counterparts."
2,The lids don't fit,"On a $22 dollar set of glass containers the lids should fit. I found this out two weeks after receiving the containers and using several of them. Most of the lids fit, but it's annoying with the larger containers because the lids are too small. This is the downside of buying stuff mail order. How much time am I going to spend packing up and shipping back a $22 container set? I would not buy this item again and will most likely not buy the pyrex brand again. I will think twice about buying kitchenware over the internet. Sometimes it's worth it to pay extra and buy it retail, because it's easy to make returns."
4,You get what you see,"Some of the lids were initially kind of hard to put on and that would be my major complaint. After a wash though they fit pretty well. I read a lot about people dropping the glass and it breaking, which is what I'm pretty sure happens to most glass if you drop it. Just be careful handling it. Overall great product."
4,Could Be Better!,"I like these bowls because they are durable and dishwasher safe and also no foods stain them like plastic containers. The only thing that could make them better is for them to have a larger capacity inside to hold more and to offer more variety of sizes. Overall, they are a good quality product for the money."
5,Decent size collection...,We've been trying to eliminate plastics from our kitchen. This set replaced a bunch of plastic storage containers. The great thing about Pyrex is that I can stick it in the microwave (or even the oven) without concerns.
4,Microwave your lunch in glass!,Great set but some of the pieces turned out to be smaller than I was expecting. Otherwise it makes my lunch at work look better and can avoid microwaving in plastic.
2,Lids suck!,I just ordered this on Amazon as it was such a great deal but for some reason the lids are very hard to close...you have to press really hard for them to close! I have other similar Pyrex glass containers and those lids are fine so not sure what is wrong with these but I do NOT recommend them because of the crappy lids!.
4,Very good and worth it!,The Pyrex set is really durable and good! I like the combination of sizes available as a part of this set!
5,corningware,Items were as advertised and the price was better than I had seen them in a store. I like that they can be used in microwave without the problems of plastic storage.Package was delivered right on time.
4,Great Storage set - Good for packing lunch,I store food in these containers everyday. I bring meals with me to work witheBags Crew Cooler II+Solid Construction/Lasts longer than plastic+Tight seal - Won't burst open in your bag+You can bake/microwave with these+Stains come off easier than plastic-Heavy - But that's expected with solid glass products-Very Tight Seal - Can be a pain to close the containers-Want more sizes!Overall this is a great choice whether you store many left overs in the friday or pack lunch for work everyday.
4,Better than I expected,"Fast Delivery, strong glass and dishwasher safe. well worth the sale price. Seen the same item selling for twice the priceat Walmart."
3,ORIENTAL FURNITURE BOX OF 4 TERRA COTTA WARRIORS..,Came covered with a dirty oil type substance. when I called to find out what the substance was I did not receive a logical answer i..e. nobody new just a bunch of made up assumptions. Took about :30 to clean the warriors. RANCE POWERS.
4,Very cool,"I bought these for a friend who is into Oriental Art, specifically samurai and warriors and such. He, and I, though these looked very nifty. They come wrapped very safely to avoid damage and have an awesome looking box to keep them in too!"
3,History was already made.,"While I have nothing particularly against this game, it is incredibly similar to Hearts of Iron II which has been out for some time. I'm sure if I played Making History a little more I could find some differences but the two games are virtually identical. The economy in Hearts of Iron is a little more detailed as is the research of technology. Hearts of Iron does have cheat codes which make the game considerably easier depending on your preference for difficulty level but with, all the cheats inactive, the two games are incredibly similar."
2,Too Easy,"My fifth game, playing as America, I conquered Germany and Italy by 1939 with nothing but stacks of medium tanks. No air force, no navy. Just stacks of tanks. On normal difficulty. Nuff said."
3,Big Scream TV: The Boo Tube! Volume 1,"Basically this DVD is a good attrempt at putting scary faces on a tv screen. There are at least 10 different scary characters. Each of them has around 5 to 8 different little snipets. It is not too scary for small ones. I have a 6 yr girl, I had to sit with her through the video the first time and after that she was fine.I am not happy with the menu options. If they would allow you to just select individual video clips, like chapters then I feel that this Halloween decoration tool would have been better utilized. Basically you have to watch the entire video from beginning to end and repeat the whole dvd if you are using it for a tv decoration.Personally I am going to attempt to load it into my computer and cut it up into pieces and recreate it back to dvd and then use it as a Halloween prop."
3,Bid Hastin Avon Collectors Encyclopedia,"I was under the impression that the book had more of a variety of ""collectibles"" than shown. I have several items from the 60's to the late 80's that I could not find. The collectible I was most interested in finding was a set of 4 Birds from 1986. All 4 are stamped except one--the owl--does not have the year on the base."
1,very disappointing,"I just received this book and was very disappointed.I have an older avon book with color pages and handy guide.This book had unclear,black and white pictures.Hard to use.I definately would not recommend this book for a collector."
3,Bud Hastin's 16th Ed Avon Collector's Encyclopedia,"This book proved very helpful to me, but, there were some Avon items I have that I believe should have been in the book (alongside similar items), but, were not. I would suggest people buy this book if they have Avon items, but, remember that the book is not inclusive."
1,Very Disappointed!!,"I bought this book for several different reasons but mainly for Avon beer steins...most of which my husband has...and didn't get enough information from this book to really be able to price even one out of all that he has...My husband and I both agree that this book is short on information, details, and inventory. Really wish that I had not bought the book."
3,Found it to be just too darn small,"Coming from a large family, I am always taking my camera (CP 5600) to many family gatherings. When indoors, I try to use AC power to save on batteries. The case is not big enough to carry this accessory in it. It's barely accommodates an extra disk and set of batteries. I am now looking (in person, not online this time) for a bigger bag so I can carry everything I need in one bag. If you are one to travel light, this may be perfect for you. I do feel the quality of the bag is excellent!"
2,"NOT for Coolpix 2200, 3200, or 4100 unless you're a magician","I didn't listen to the naysayers. After all, why would Nikon state that this case was for ALL of the following cameras (Coolpix 2200, 3200, 4100, 4600, 5600, 7600) if it was not true? Besides, everyone loves to gripe on the internet. In this case, they were right! I own the handy Coolpix 3200 and it is like trying to fit size 12 hips into a pair of size 10 jeans....you can do it but it's a struggle and you are afraid of breaking the zippers! Finally, the newer Coolpix Cameras are SMALLER than the older cameras so they should fit just fine in this NIKON camera case. In conclusion, if you own a 2200,3200, or 4100 - SKIP THIS ONE - Trust Me! Mine is going straight back to eBay. If you own the 4600,5600,or 7600 Coolpix Digital Camera, you will be thrilled with this custom case."
3,A bit of a squeeze...,"I bought this case for my Nikon Coolpix 3200 so I could carry it around and not worry about it getting damaged or dirty. The case accomplished this for the most part, but it is a bit tight. When I first got the case, I had to kind of cram the camera in there (cram gently, of course, being a $300 camera). The main issue seems to be that it is meant to fit the camera EXACTLY, like biking shorts, so it is a bit tight around the edges and very nerve-wracking the first time you zip it up.Being Neoprene though, it does relax and stretch out a little bit over time, so it redeems itself in the long run. If someone were looking to buy a camera case, I would recommend looking at others before this one, but should you choose to purchase, be aware that it is rather tight."
1,Coolpix L1 - No Way ! DO NOT BUY,"I received this case as a gift. It is unfortunate, the buyer believed what they read. Truth is, the Coolpix will fit on the 2nd or 3rd try - BARELY. It is too much trouble to deal with if one is out shooting. I would guess the zipper would give out soon enough as one has to force it closed. If you remember one thing, remember this. DO NOT GET THIS CASE FOR THE COOLPIX L1. The case MUST be larger. The ARE other choices out there !"
5,Camera case,I have found this case to be a very convenient way to carry my camera. I am able to store spare batteries in the separate pouch
3,Not that wonderful,"It is awkward to carry, and the camera barely fits into the case. If you plan on having extra SD cards, batteries or anything else... put them in your pocket because they will not fit. The case is so small, when putting the camera in, it turns the knobs and even put a scratch on my view finder because you have to pretty much stuff it in."
2,Don't buy this case if you own a Nikon Coolpix L1,"If you have a Nikon Coolpix L1 don't buy this case. It's just too small for L1's lens. I bought it and it doesn't fit well. It looks like you put a sock in it. However, it's ok for the Nikon 5600"
2,Tight fit,I have to jam my P1 into this tiny bag and I am afraid that I will scratch the screen. I am looking for a new bag that is a bit bigger with a velcro flap instead of the zipper.
1,Does not fit L110,I did not see the part about not compatible with L100 or L110 before I bought it. I have an L110 with larger lens.
3,Not for Coolpix L100,"I bought this case because the description states that it is for Nikon Coolpix L Series Digital Cameras. Unfortunately it does not fit my Nikon Coolpix L100. I was dissapointed. It seems like a decent case. It is a soft case, so it is the kind for keeping the camera clean and free of snudges and scratches while you carry it."
2,Missing Item,The picture and product indicates that the camera strap would be included with the case (every other one is included) and this one did not have the strap.
4,NIkon Coolpix Case,"Camera fits snugly, well-made construction, & easy to take along with you as it has an expandable strap for over-the-shoulder or around-the-neck wear. The only downfall is there isn't any space for batteries and just enough room for a picture card. Maybe, once it has been broken in, I'll try to add the spare batteries, but don't expect them to fit without cramming them in. Overall, this is a nice case for your Coolpix."
3,Nice look but too small,"It`s a nice stuff, but it hasn`t enough space for accesories like bateries and others. It's too soft, then when you take the case you can turn on the camera inside."
5,Nikon Camera Coolpix L Series Case,"I was very pleased with my purchase, I wanted something to keep my camera from getting damaged, that was made especially for my camera."
2,One size does not fit all,"I have a coolpix L1, and it BARELY fits in this case. I don't know who wrote that this case fit all these cameras-but they must have been on some really good drugs at the time.Not all cameras are the same size. I use this because I HAVE to protect the camera somehow, but it was a real waste of $$$Come on Nikon=get on the ball and design a carrying case for EACH camera-is it really that hard????"
5,perfect fit for my camera!,This camera case is perfect. I love the adjustable shoulder strap. The strap is also detachable so the case can easily fit in a purse or small bag. There is also a small pocket to store the strap or extra batteries or memory card.
4,Just right...,This camera bag is just the right size for my Nikon Coolpix L2. Not a lot of room but a snug fit. The bag comes with a carrying strap. Inside pocket for a memory card. The bag also has a front pocket and a strip in the back so you can loop your belt through it. I have attached pictures. I'm glad I bought it. I'm taking a trip to the Carribean in a few months and find the compactness perfect. Who wants to carry a huge camera bag?
4,functional enough,"It does what it needs to, no bells or whistles in terms of looks. Perfectly adequate."
5,A very precise and engaging study of Louis Kahn's buildings!,"Klaus-Peter Gast's book provides a geometric analysis of Louis Kahn's buildings, as well as an in-depth analysis of Lou's personal way of building with deep respect for the great architectural periods of the past.The author's geometric drawings/diagrams & text - coupled with brilliant photographs and Lou's drawings - take Louis Kahn's buildings/structures beyond simple tracing and observation:this important book takes us on a fascinating journey through Louis I. Kahn's intelligible and organic geometrical equilibrium, to the structurally ordered whole and the powerful & enigmatic monumentality of Lou's masterpieces.A serious and carefully crafted publication that requires commitment and visual attention.A truly monumental book!"
4,"Classy presentation, could be heavier","Pretty pan - makes for a striking presentation on the table but, the copper could be heavier, I fear that the base could burn on a long roast. I have an old All-Clad Ltd anodized roaster and a rather large Ikea 8qt. cast iron roaster that I will use first in a long-roast situation. I'll save this for braised chard or something."
2,"Not citrus, not moist!","I purchased this at a hotel gift shop in Las Vegas because my lips were super-dry due to the low humidity in the desert, and it was the only product they had (go figure). There was NO citrus scent/flavor, it tasted like plain wax. Further, the balm was very very firm and barely coated my lips to keep them moist. Not a product I will buy again. I think I'll stick with chap-stick at 1/3 the price..."
5,Buck 192BR Fixed Blade Knife,"I purchased this knife for my daughter-in-law, she just loves it! Great gift for someone special. I'm positive if you purchase this knife and through Amazon, you will be completely satisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Eh.,"Yes the author was 95% true to the Wolverine character (thanks), Yes there was action, and yes there was some good writing. But the story still came out eh. The story was fairly bland and the book was easy to put down. When something big did happen in the story you just didn't really care. Maybe I'm not easily impressed anymore, or maybe the marvel novels aren't as good as they use to be. If you are a marvel geek like me then you'll have to buy it no matter who says what. But if you are just a normal reader, hit the back button."
4,A good book,I felt that the author of this book was true to Wolverine's character. I loved that action scenes as well as Wolverine's dry sense of humor. I felt that the book was on par with each of the Wolverine comic books. This book could be enjoyed by someone who was and still is a fan of the comics. The book could also be enjoyed by someone who has very little knowledge of Wolverine as well.
4,entertaining read for fans,"I defintely wouldn't claim this book as a masterpiece...but it was a nice, quick, entertaining read about wolverine."
3,Kenneth Cole REACTION Men's Total Contrast Boat Shoe,"The shoes look pretty nice, but the toe area is a more or less not sturdy. Good shoe if you don't care about the toe area though."
3,polishing,It needs to have instructions for how much to use. Stones came out all right but I would have liked more shine
4,Jean Godfrey-June is the real deal,"Jean Godfrey-June offers beauty advice that real women (even, gasp, working moms) can benefit from. Her monthly column in Lucky magazine is something I flip to first, with much anticipation, and she manages to cut through the hoo-ha of beauty marketing with both grace and humor. Equally admirable in my book, she makes trenchant observations about the crossover products -- those products one buys for your children or other members of your family that can be re-used for yourself. In this way, her guidance marries the best of the women's magazine ilk (do it cheaper or more efficiently) with the heady fashion forward tone of Lucky. I love going to Target with her column in hand, and buying 60% of what appears in any given month. And when she does reccomend a pricier item, I have full confidence that it will not disappoint. I think it's entirely possible that she is beauty's fairy godmother for every woman (and baby, teen, and man, to boot)."
5,Not great literature but certainly great fun!,"How nice to find a beauty editor who's managed to retain her sense of humor. There is a very droll wit at work here, and it's perfect for the subject matter. Godfrey-June is intelligent and speaks in a voice all her own--readers of her Lucky column will recognize it immediately. She really is like no other. The amazing thing is that there really is something for everyone even remotely interested in beauty/fashion in here and, unlike Allure's new ""Confessions of a Beauty Editor,"" which takes recycling to a whole new level, this is an original voice with something new and different to say. She never takes herself too seriously, which is part of the charm. It's good, quirky fun. Long may Godfrey-June remain comfortably ensconced ""above the fray"" at Lucky--they are ""lucky"" to have her."
1,don't waste your money!!,"When I saw this book pop up on my recommended screen, I was instantly excited. I was expecting a snarky book with clever writing and amazing stories about the lengths people would go to for free beauty goodies.I ended up being extremely disappointed.Maybe its the conversion to an ebook that does the damage. There are distracting ""tip boxes"" that in a normal book, you would understand their placement, but in an ebook they look like new chapters or the like, and its distracting and disjointing and in the end, utterly useless to have these tip boxes come up. Some of them can take a couple of pages to go away and by that point you've lost the flow (what little flow there is) of the story.I like a good trashy read, but this book just doesn't do it for me.If you're looking for how it should be done, read ""Bringing Home the Birkin""."
1,Simply Horrible,"Jean Godfrey-June may be a good beauty editor, but she can't write a book worth a damn. This book is sooo badly written and filled with useless trivia and inane remarks. I got halfway through this childlishy-written book and had to put it down. From what I did read, I learned nothing new about the beauty industry. Probably the most frustrating part of the book are all the ""sidebar"" blocks of ""asides"" that interrupt paragraphs and sidetrack you from reading the text. All these ""ah-has"" from June are nothing new and simply drivel."
1,Richard Buse 1041,This is a review of tax software that prepares Form 1041Not an article about preparing the Form 1041
5,"Clear, simple, complete coverage of building systems","Mr. Reid presents each aspect of building development and construction simply and clearly while constantly highlighting their significance in the overall project development and construction process.The manner and tone of the material presented, as well as the text and illustrations make this book a valuable reference for people needing to grasp any or all aspects of building projects large, intermediate or small in scope and size."
4,Great for beginners,This text is a great introduction to the world of building systems. It spells out in easliy understandable terminology the basics of many systems with great little sketches to boot. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about how buildings work and are constructed.
1,not the correct language,"the low rating is not because of the movie. Its because the picture shows Tamil and the movie I got was in Hindi. So, I am kind of disappointed."
4,chandramukhi tamil dvd,"It is a very entertaining movie.The actors and actresses have done a wonderful job in creating the characters they portray.It is an unusual theme. It has comedy, mystery, interesting story and music score. All the songs and dances are very good.My special kudos to Rajnikant, Jyothika, Vasu, Vadivelu and the mantravadi.Devaki GanesanOklahoma City, OK,USA"
2,pyrex baking dish with insulated carrier,This was way over priced! I found it in the store for half the price and was very disappointed not sure I will shop again on Amazon
3,Good,The packaging was excellent. And it served the purpose for which it was intended.Was better than all the products I had examined while shopping around in Sydney.
3,"Ok, but not 500'","I have bought many Rapture (by Metra) cables, and while the quality is ok, the roll length is always about 10% less than indicated. Doesn't matter if it's power, ground, or speaker cables---they are always short. These 500' rolls measure about 440'."
3,Good system with flaws.,"Contains everything you'll need to get satellite radio in your car, however, the only drawback is the signal reception is average on the FM transmitter. Most newer vehicles no longer have tape players in the stereos and thus the ability to get a clearer signal using the direct wired tape signal converter to the stereo is useless. Overall a good product, though I wish there was some way to get a direct feed to the stereo to avoid occassional static and transmission noise."
3,Good overview of strategic purchasing to reduce costs,"This book is very focused on purchasing rather than the traditional view of supply chain that incorporates all materials, production and delivery related business processes. Given that narrow focus, it handles the purchasing subject reasonably well, but from a high level. It is a good book for executives without appreciation for the key drivers from across the organization of total life cycle costs. Includes many case studies relating purchasing cost savings based on cross organizational cooperation and viewpoint. If you want a book about 'Supply Chain', pass on this one."
5,OLD.....but NOT FORGOTTEN.,"I disagree with the other reviewer (Fred). I saw this only once over 25 years ago and have never forgotten it. Was it that good? Well, it apparently made an impression on my young mind. Add to that I've always liked Jan-Michael Vincent. Other favorites of mine with JMV during this time was ""TRIBES"" and ""BUSTER AND BILLIE"" -- both cult favorites of mine. If Jan-Michael Vincent seemed he'd rather be somewhere else in this movie, it was because he was the only one that did not want any part of taking the ill-gotten money (at least intially). He was the only one with a conscience of right and wrong wanting to do the right thing. This movie really makes one think what one would do if in a similar situation (""DELIVERANCE"" was a similar scenario). Overall, I think this is a very good movie. How good? Good enough I still remember it more than 25 years later after only seeing it ONE time!"
5,Using your phone as a GPS,"If you have ever wanted a GPS but not want an additional piece of equipment, this is for you. We have used it all over the US and and had no trouble. The only down side is that one map will fit on a memory card at a time, so you either erase and put on a new map or do what I did, get more 512 mb cards. I now have the maps ready for wherever I travel. I did get tripped up in NY. I loaded the east coast and western NY is on the midwest map.We really enjoy our new toy."
1,Vista My A_ _. This is the old version. It will not run on Vista at all.,"The Game Itself is exellent. I prefer it over microsoft flight sim. But if you are looking for a copy that runs on vista don't bother. CDRom USA are pulling a bait and switch with this Title. They have this advertised as a product that will opperate on windows vista. that is a lie. EA or Looking Glass Studios, the makers of flight unlimited 3 have not released a version for windows vista. You can go to there website to find this out. There is not and will not be a version for vista in the near futer. And from what I found out it will probebly be named flight unlimited 4... Don't get suckered like I did. These guys are selling out dated software and passing it of as windows vista ready.. The are scammers in the worst way. Better yet they are Dam Liars"
2,Headers,Picture of Hedman 88400 headers shows long-tube headers - they are actually 'shorty' headers. Picture(s) should represent actual product!! I had to send my order back and reorder.
2,"good product, but...","This product arrived in a beat up and previously opened box. The hammock was new, but I think it had been returned to the sell before for cuts in the hammock. There were three cuts that look like box knife cuts. They were all marked by small white stickers like a previous customer marked them for return. I needed to use this hammock the next day so I kept it, otherwise this would have gone straight back. As far as usefullness, this hammock is great."
5,Outstanding Collection of Beverly Sills's moving performances,This is an outstanding collection of Beverly Sills's arias and moving performances. Even if you are not a Beverly Sills fan this CD is a must in any opera lover's collection. A sublime voice in an outstanding collection.
5,Sills fits my bill,This recording is another in an all too small CD collection of Sills recordings. I eagerly await more.
3,very good but better if it came in colors,"This is a very good product. My Mother likes them because they're comfortable and look and feel like regular underwear, especially in the Summer. Unfortunately because they only come in white, so they could be confused with a ""Depend"" type pair and get thrown out. At $24 a piece, it's an expensive mistake."
4,"Good product, guessed the right size","I wear a 10 usually and ordered a 14 in these, based on the sizing guidelines. When I opened the package my mouth dropped open - they looked enormous, much larger than a size 10 panty. But I guess it's just the high waist- they actually fit okay, and the legs are just a little snug. Not binding, but enough to prevent leaks. I don't know how they'd hold up to a real ""accident"" because I'm wearing them overnight in lieu of disposable pads, for relatively minor leakage and occasional mid-night urgency. I'm trying to use fewer disposables and these help with that, so I'm ordering a couple more pairs to alternate. In any case, pay attention to the laundering instructions: NO FABRIC SOFTENER. I'm sure they mean it, so I'm following the directions."
4,Warm and cozy,"I've been needing a nice jacket for a while, and for the price this was a great buy. The inside is lined with fake fur that makes it warm and cozy like a blanket, and the outer material keeps the wind from blowing right through it. The collar is a little more open that I would have liked, but if you have a nice scarf to fill it in it works really well."
3,Not very original,"I bought this game for my 88 year old mother who liked playing the online version of the first Kahuna Reef. I downloaded this one to my computer first to give it a try and while some higher levels are a bit more difficult, it's pretty much same.. same.. same - at least as far as I've gotten. Nothing unique that I've seen about this match 3 game, although the backgrounds are pretty and the music relaxing."
2,Disappointed by Looking for Lovedu,"The book had an exciting segment through DRC, where Muggleton and Jones struggle through the Routes de Zaires. I felt that this was the one redeeming feature of what otherwise felt like a feminist rant through Africa. Each time a woman was working and a man sitting in the shade, it was written as if a grave injustice against women throughout the world.The purpose of the book seemed to stick with this theme, her feminism vs Muggleton who could do no right. Once Muggleton left, the book weakened into a dull drive down to find the rain queen. Jone's character withered into a shallow traveller trying to sensationalize women's rights by relying on her own pre-biased judgements."
3,Interesting but short.,"From Europe, America, Asia and Africa this book gives a small picture of people that have brought to life their unique visions of what their environments/dwellings should look like.The book is quite short, 191 small pages, with pictures usually taking up two of them. It has a little bit of text explaining who built what and where it's located on a few separate pages, making it a nuisance having to jump back and forth, trying to figure out who made what. It would have been nice to have some in depth history on the buildings and their builders.Otherwise this book does have a bunch of quite eccentric buildings that you probably haven't seen in any other books. If your interested in this type of stuff, the price is right, so go for it."
2,Dabbling in Outsider Art,"The world of outsider art ranges from powerful creative urges overtaking a person's life to mental illness externalized. I had high hopes that this book would shed light on what the context and 'truth' of some of these places really is; instead we have a mediocre photo essay that picks up some of the 'cool' details but tells none of the truth.This is a tourist's journal, nothing more to it. Don't bother... there are many other sources to really understand the truths of this world outside the world of art."
1,12 bucks for a 312KB .pdf file,"Yeah, it mentions ""This is an eBook, not an interactive CD. Please know what you are ordering"" in a separate product description, but what it doesn't say is that it's a tiny .pdf file that ships on a disk in a paper sleeve protected by a standard envelope with a 42 cent stamp on the front. And they charge you 3.99 for shipping.Oh, and if you want, they'll offer you the opportunity to just email the .pdf file to you for the same price and still charge you the 3.99 shipping. Apparently Amazon won't let them email it to you without a shipping markup.According to them."
2,old... but is it true,"cast of thousands, great special effects all set against the splendour and tragedy of roman israel. it rivals ""gone with the wind"" in its tale of conflict, romance and above all many, many deaths. its a fantastic beach read as it will last far beyond the usual fortnight in benidorm. however. a certain suspension of disbelief is needed at times. the author clearly has a god complex. after all, 7 days and nights? come on jehovah, windows98 took far longer and was released with way more bugs than ""the world"". also the main charcter is way too wet to appeal, lucifer is far more magnetic a character.. as a first attempt it is a worthy effort but does not compare to other first time deities who have written such stonkers as the firebrand ""koran"" and the almost biblical ""talmud"". i hear the author is reissueing this with a new ending in the millenium. i wait with baited breath"
1,Not as expected,"This product is beautiful but little as a baby burp. I buy it thinking it was a blanket because WAS on the blanket section. If you are going to biy it, keep in mind the size AND THE PRICE."
5,Colorful fun ball with chimes inside,"I purchased this ball for my 9 month old niece. She loves it and it is a lot of fun. As you roll it, the chimes inside provide lovely listening. The colors are very eye-catching. It's a good gift because she can play with her 3 year old sister. I recommend it highly."
4,Thought it would be bigger,Got this ball today. My daughter started playing with it straight away. Bit disappointed by the size of it though. Thought it was a big ball for the price. It's about the lenght of my hand. Medium size ball?
2,There is a noise ball inside this ball,"The description failed to mention that there was a noise bell inside this ball.That would have been good to know before purchasing.I was actually purchasing this ball as an inside sports training aid (she is a pre-teen).I checked the description very closely but it did not mention that this is a ""noise"" toy.I had to return the toy. No problems with the return."
3,Be aware,"The current ball being shipped out does not have the words on the ball for each color (as in the customer images). The only picture that accurately represents the ball is the first one. Also, it does not have as long nap as the ones in the ""customer images"". Comes in a ziplock type bag which is good. Otherwise looks good and I hope it holds up over time."
2,Poor stitching,"The ball itself is fine, it's colorful and soft, but we have owned it for a month and it the stitching is already coming undone. Bear in mind I have a very young child - it's not been used except to roll the ball across the carpet. Disappointing!"
3,My Head is going to burst!!!,"This is an interesting game and I bet it would be great for someone that likes to memorize stuff. I'm not one of those people and I think my head is going to burst from all the memory games! So, remember this review (if you can!) when your head is about to burst from all the memorization. Yiks!"
2,OKAY a real review,"I am admittedly a casual gamer. Meaning I like games that are fun and you don't get stuck on. Games that you can play again and again and feel like you just had a blast. It does not need to be and rearely is a game that you have to play for hours on end to get real enjoyment out of it. With that knowlege, as a casual gamer, this game stinks. Sorry, but it does. I like puzzle games. Intelligence cube on the psone, tetris, bust a move, and most recently polarium have all been my favorites and extremely addicting gems. PQ is not. It is hard as all get out, and you will get stuck for days on one puzzle. A better thinking puzzle game is smart bomb on the psp. THis is hard but it is hard because you have time limits. It is not hard because it is impossble to figure out like PQ. But if you enjoy spending your years figuring out impossible puzzles, this is for you. Hope this helps."
5,Great entertainment and a good challenge,"I received this for Christmas. It has a nice clean look to it and the challenges are interesting and varied. I am sure this will be good mental exercise - after I finished playing, I found myself pondering over one of the puzzles thinking of an alternate solution. Good mind candy !!"
4,Very interesting read,"I found this book to be interesting as well as thought-provoking. The author had each chapter listed as a question that he has found to be relevant to our lives at one point or another, such as ""What is Love?"", ""Are You Offended, Or Are You Harmed?"", ""Must You Suffer?"", and ""How can You Handle Change?"".In each chapter, the author explains how using philosophy can help you to answer these questions and apply them to your life in order to make positive changes within. He gives readers a new way to look at certain situations, like just because you are offended by someone, does not mean that any harm has been caused to you. You have the power to accept the offense or let it go. The author also gives examples of real-life situations taken from clients of his philosophical counseling practice. He applies what he has taught in each chapter to an event that we can understand more fully and how the process of using philosophy really can change your life."
4,My first introduction to real vampire folklore,"When I was thirteen in the mid nineties this book introduced me to the world of vampire folklore at a time when I was heavily obsessed with things like Forever Knight and Dark Shadows. This book was a wake up call about the disturbing quality of real folklore put in plain and simple text that a child could understand and appreciate such as the chapter called ""Being bitten by dead Uncle Boris"" to explain why the vampire bite in folklore was not viewed as sensual or romantic.This book is, even today, very helpful and insightful and I recommend it to anyone who is just starting out in their research into the supernatural. The author, Daniel Cohen, has appeared on such shows as The History Channel's History's Mysteries and has a similar book on werewolves. I recommend both."
3,Good Solid,"This book gives some accounts about real incidents involving vampires. As Hollywood portrays vampires as bloodsucking, crucifix dodging ghouls, this book takes a look at five or so well documented historical events where vampires were involved and dispells the Hollywood myth. It briefly touches on Bram Stoker's Dracula and the 1922 film Nosferatu, but the majority of the book looks at old and modern vampires in the world we live in.It's a quick read, but definately worth a look if you've always wondered about real life vampires."
4,videonow,product works but be sure you order a disc to check it out even if it says disc included doesn't mean you will get it
4,Fantastic overview of M&A with many real-world examples,"This book is a great way to learn about the nitty-gritty of mergers & acquisitions. It offers a variety of methods to examine M&A projects and it uses real-life examples. As opposed to many other texts, it is also very readable. It is one of the few accessible M&A books for neophytes."
4,Very Powerful little tool,Excellent product-delivers the froth is seconds. It was a great gift. They love it.
3,should be stronger,"i like my foamer and if I lost it, I would buy another...BUT, I think its too weak. It gets slowed down by thicker liquids and it ceases to move when it touches the bottom/side of the cup."
5,Works great!,This product makes a nice foam whether the milk is hot or cold. Great little tool if your frothier on your expression machine doesn't do a great job.
2,Not working after 1 month,"I purchased this because my ""heifer"" model aero latte motor died after 18 months of use. I thought this would be more reliable motor, but it behaved oddly from time I got it on Dec. 24th. If not just so in the stand, it started running. The switch to turn it on kept running very very quickly, and I had to almost fight to keep it off. Then the whipping arm fell off when I put it in a drain to dry off. Got it back on and kept ""latte-ing"" for a few more weeks. Now, motor makes a grinding noise. Swapped in new batteries, but no improvement.I suggest keeping to cheaper model and just expect to have to replace,periodically."
3,Some good some not so good,"Some good, some not so good: It seems very sturdy and like it will last a long while (unlike the previous brand I had). But, I wish it had a momentary switch instead of the fixed on/off. Also, the whisk seems a little large. Might work a little better if the whisk were a little smaller."
1,A Useless Product Guarantee!,"Our aerolatte was pressed into domestic service to make froth for about 6 cups of coffee daily and it stopped working after only three months. The email address on the aerolatte 5-year guarantee policy is no longer in use and their web site doesn't accept product complaints once the boxes have been filled in. Their fax number listed on the aerolatte web site didn't connect despite many attempts. We bought a product with a 5-year guarantee only to discover that the company CAN'T BE REACHED, except when placing an order!?! In light of such poor customer care, I advise against buying an aerolatte product. As a byline, in 2007 we had bought three no-name China frothers at a very low price- they only lasted about 2 months each which is why we bought the ""superior-original"" aerolatte, which too, is JUNK."
4,Aerolatte steel frother,"This tool can take milk and produce quite a bit of froth as long as you havehealthy batteries installed. I have noticed that this frother is not as good with pre sweetened milk, the froth doesnt seem to make for some reason.Simple pure milk makes the best froth with this."
2,"Good, while it works","Makes great lattes, but has some sort of electrical contact issue inside. It works intermittently or not at all now."
5,Worth It's Weight In Gold!!,"This is the best little invention since sliced bread!! It is quick to mix, and quick to clean PLUS--it takes up little space on the kitchen counter!! The seller was very prompt and truly has a GREAT product!! I've used one of these for many years--lost my first one while moving--replaced it immediately!"
4,Nice frother,"This frother is quite efficient in foaming milk for a latte or other coffee drink, when you don't want to take the time to froth milk in a steamer. I am sorry I bought the one with a stand, though. I found the same frother with a carrying tube which makes it nice for travel--it was at Bed, Bath & Beyond and was $5.00 less than this one that I purchased through Amazon."
3,"Frothing is A-1 - but leaves you ""cold"" unlike a traditional steam frother","I gave this as a gift to a friend, and although he claims it works fantastically as far as its frothing capabilities go - he tells me it has perhaps one downfall which is that because it is handheld, and/or a separate entity from his java machine, that it lacks the benefit of using pressurized steam to do the frothing. He tells me that he now has an extra step in preparing his morning jolt consisting of a brief stint into the microwave for his frothy ""moo juice"" before it can be inter-mingled with his xtra potent cuppa joe!"
4,Works great!,I bought this item as a gift for someone and they told me that it worked fabulously and frothed the milk just like a steamer would! They also said the stand looked stylish in the kitchen.
5,Absolutely love it!,"I love this frother! It makes wonderful latte- I heat up my skim milk in the microwave about 40 seconds, then use the frother for about 5 seconds. Add a little caramel syrup and my coffee and I have an incredible coffee drink for much less than Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts! Much simpler than the espresso machine I bought in January which took about 20 minutes and was hard to clean- not to mention how the steam scared me! An added bonus- my daughter drinks all her milk now since I froth her chocolate, strawberry, or even white milk!!"
2,Aerolatte Stainless Steel Deluxe Edition Frother & Stand,"I purchased the Aerolatte Stainless Steel Deluxe Edition Frother & Stand on August 10th, 2012. At first, it worked just fine once I got the hang of how to use it.Unfortunately, about a month later, it started to slow down. Finally, on December 1st it just quit working. I went to store to buy the best batteries as perinstructions and it still won't work. It is just plain dead. I am now starting the process to see what the ""5 year guarantee"" which is stamped on the box means for fixing or replacing the product. I am hoping they will replace it since it was not a cheap item.Aerolatte Deluxe Edition Milk Frother with Stand, Stainless Steel"
1,what a piece of junk,Shaft is so weak that it torqued itself out of commission in less than 90 days. Would return for my money back but it's too late. No surprise there. Shame on amazon for listing this kind of crap on its website.
5,Nice product,"The Aerolatte does precisely what the manufacturer claims it will do.Nothing more, nothing less.Having just returned from Italy, and having been reminded of the delights of coffee drinks with hot, foamy milk, my spouse and I thought we were destined to drag out the old machine with the cranky, fussy steam nozzle. But no! We found this little baby. Bliss.We've only had it about a week, so I can't comment on long-term reliability. But if it breaks in 6 months, I'll just buy a new one."
3,"Great product, but could be better if It had different speeds","I have a full time job and go to school full time, so I wanted a product that would help me make a quick and delicious coffee in the morning. Aerolatte Deluxe Milk frother is a great product, I have seen other brands that were not nearly as steady as this product. It does an awesome job at frothing milk, however, it has a VERY strong spinner, so you need a big cup to froth the milk separately because it creates a LOT of volume. I know it sounds lazy, but I wanted something that I could make a quick froth in the same cup and be on my way, which I cant do because this product causes a mini Tsunami in the cup.In the end, this is a great product, but I really wish it had more than 1 speed option, so the milk wouldn't spill out."
4,sturdy and good looking,"I bought this frother to replace an old one (from Bodum). I was pleased with the ""simpler"" and cheaper Bodum frother, it worked fine, but it was not as sturdy as the Aerolatte is. I broke 3 Bodums and was ready to experience a new type of frother. The Aerolatte is much more sturdy, has a slightly bigger frother part and this deluxe version looks much more fancy. I like the stand that comes with, which makes it less likely that the frother will get damage due to improper storage. The frothed milk is almost as good as the one from let's say Starbucks. The only little minus is that the knob to put the frother on and off is somewhat stiff. Sometimes I need two hands to put it on, so I won't use to much pressure and mayba damage it. That is the only reason why I gave this frother 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"""Upgraded""? I don't think so!","After struggling with Aerolatte's cheaper model for over a year, I decided to upgrade to this model. Yes it has a stronger motor, but the case doesn't come apart to adjust switch contacts, which seems to be the weak link of these things. So after 9 months, mine will no longer switch on, Amazon will no longer accept return, & Aerolatte will only replace if I ship it back to them - in the UK - at my expense. Adding shipping cost, waiting time at the post office & customs paperwork = more trouble than it's worth."
4,So Pleased!,"First, I'm NOT a kitchen gadget person. I want a knife and a cutting board, not a different gadget for every different job.We've had this for a few weeks now and LOVE IT! This takes up just a tiny bit of counter space, cleans easily (I wipe it down and run it in hot soapy water), and works well. We have rechargeable batteries in it and they last through 3 uses a day for about 2 weeks before having to switch out.I've always thought Starbucks was over-roasted, muddy, and over-priced to begin with. The other day I was crashing so stopped for a mocha and was seriously woken up to how awful it is. After drinking lovely cappuccinos at home every morning for weeks now with this fabulous frother, there's no way I can go back to that yick.Better for my body, wallet, and waistline!"
5,GREAT,"Only used it for two days but love this product! The milk steamer/frother on my espresso machine died, so I realized I was essentially only making strong coffee...this product made my day!!!"
1,"Right out of the box, didn't work","I guess I would have given this item zero stars if I could have, because I never got it to turn on, right out of the box! It comes with its own ""new"" batteries and a little flexible plastic tab that you are instructed to remove to activate them, but it never did turn on. Even after replacing with brand-new batteries, item still would not work. Very disappointed... will be returning."
2,To slow,I bought this frother as a replacement for a manual plunger type frother. It takes forever. I gave it away within days of purchase.
4,Important Tip about Frother,"I love my Aerolatte frother, but it was frustrating that it would only work for 2-3 months and then die and I would have to purchase a new one. I noticed one day when I replaced the batteries that they were very warm, so I started removing the batteries from the unit after each use. Prior to this, I was replacing the batteries every 1-2 weeks when I only used the frother for a few minutes each the morning. I believe the batteries heat up and burn out and also damage the unit. So, try removing the batteries after each use and your frother should last a lot longer. My current frother is at 6 months and I've had no problems."
4,"For the price , under right milk conditions,it does it job!","After some reading of reviews at Amazon and other places and experiencing it personally, teh following tips are udeful:- Fresher milk froths better (after 2 days of milk in fridge difficult to expect froth)- I do not follow instructions on Aerolatte, and found that milk just short of boiling froths way better. 2 mins for a cup of milk-The froth will go away by the time you get to work under almost all conditions."
2,Didn't last and was weak,Bought this in 2009...it died in 2012. That is just bad. It never could do more than froth milk. Just didn't have the power.
4,"Great device, but no steamed milk frother","This product seems well made and I think it will last a very long time. It creates super frothy drinks in just seconds and really adds a bit of fun flare to some otherwise drab drinks. It cleans easily and stores conveniently. The only complaint is that aerated milk simply doesn't taste the same as steamed milk. It's a good alternative, but not a replacement."
2,Worked At First,I really liked this product for about a month. The problem is that after repeated washings the long metal rod will bend just a little. Any bend in the rod will mean reduced performance (yes I tried to bend it back) so now it is in the circular file.
4,Great Gadget,This works well. I love good coffee with foam. This is easy to use and clean. I've found that it works best with hot milk.
5,What A Gem!,"I knew when I first held the Aerolatte and felt its heft, this was no cheap toy. It's handsome and does exactly what it's designed to do quickly and efficiently.Read the instructions and remember boiled milk doesn't froth well, so watch how long you nuke it. The instructions say to use low-fat or skimmed milk but it works well with evaporated milk too, which is my milk of choice.Because it spins really fast, it has very low start-up torque. If you try it for anything but frothing milk, it won't work well--It just doesn't have the power."
2,The worst of the Dune series,"Although in any other series this book might rate more highly, Heretics of Dune is simply not up to the standard set by Herbert's earlier Dune books. This book finally gives us a glimpse into the inner realms of the Bene Gesserit society, and seems to start out very well. However, soon the book lapses into merely relaying fictitious events, and the plot slows to a crawl. The character's are impossible to have any feeling for; they are quite sterile. Although this book is necessary to read in order to reach the finale, you will find that you may be reading this for a long time (it took me over a month, which was the same time it took to read the four previous books combined). Have a blast"
3,Dune still the best!,"Dune is the best of the series. Not my favorite SF book, but deservedly and truly a classic. The next volume is nothing but sad. The third volume picks up a little but not much. The fourth, fifth and sixth are, I suppose, all right: the story comes alive again. They are quite wordy and rather contrived. I am afraid I don't understand half the contents and this is mostly because of the way concepts are presented: cloaked and crowded together.One evocative example: somewhere in the second half of the series there is a bar where the owner is supposed to have added something to the beer to make people drink more. Big surpise: it has alway been in beer and is called alcohol! I have the feeling that this is typical of the whole: many stale ideas repackaged to make them seem new. But I sure have to give Frank Herbert credit for trying."
4,"I want my own Duncan Idaho, too!","Even without the Atreides in power, it still seems like they're in control...you'll have to read to find out why. Pretty interesting to see how Leto II's golden path is panning out. Very cool new characters Miles Teg and Sheeana, and the upgraded Duncan make the story about as interesting as the books of the original trilogy, I'd put it right there next to COD.Beware though, you'll need to consult an online Dune glossary once you get to about page 50. The Tleilaxu lifestyle requires learning roughly a dozen terms that shouldn't be too hard to figure out in a google search. I wonder what readers did without Internet searches, because the publisher rudely left out a much needed glossary. I should leave some props to the publisher, for including a note from Frank Herbert explaining how it took him 6 years of research before even writing the books, which explains the level of detail and imagination. Enjoy."
4,Reviled and Worshiped...,"1500 years after Leto II the God Emperor completed his transformation into the sandworm, he is reviled and worshiped throughout the universe... But now the men and women who ran to escape his tyrany are returning to Dune seeking to rule that which once ruled them...And, other then the whole ""Honoured Matres control men with sex"" and ""The Duncan Idaho ghola is a male Honoured Matre,"" the book is fairly good. despite minor shark jumping."
4,Herberts Imagination keeps going,So often writers get stuck in their own universe to the point that each story is the same. Herbert himself started to fall into that trap.. but takes a big break away with this one. Set long after the LetoII demise.. ?? the book takes the series in a new direction. We finally get to truly get into the famed Bene Gesserit's mind/community. Still lots of philosophy.. which to me is as facinating as the action is... and there's more than in God Emporer.
4,A much needed pick up to a drowning saga,"We sacrificed the grand awe of the Kwisatz Haderach and gained actual character development in return. Even trade. Sort of. And ah! Clearly established motives! Someone new to believe in... the little girl Sheeana. And a new question... Bene Gesserit vs. Honored Matres: Which witch is worse? Although I must admit I was quite confused about this ""Scattering"" thing... a welcome return of a relevant Duncan Idaho and a feisty new lover. All in all... a return to glory."
4,5th in the series,"Heretics of Dune is the 5th title in the Dune series and takes place several thousand years after the events of God Emperor of Dune. It takes as its protagonists several members of the Bene Gesserit as they confront the Bene Tleilax and the Honored Matres- a religous order from the Scattering that took place after the death of Leto II .Herbert's writing continues to improve, and this is the most accessible book yet in the series, although it still not an easy read."
5,Kinda unfair because I'd read it years ago,"It's a good sequel to the trilogy plus God Emperor of Dune -- best if you've already read the trilogy, although I suppose some people will try it standalone."
3,No where near the first four,"I guess it had to happen at some time. Rarely does an author leave us on a high note in sequals, and in this case this was unfortunately true. I was suprised to see that this book had a better review than the fourth. It seemed the author desperately tried to link this book with the past ones by constantly reminding us of the dead characters but to no avail."
3,A fresh continuation of the Dune saga,"After God Emperor (which I give two stars), I wondered how the rest of the series would go. I am relieved to say that this book has the elements Dune fans crave--complex plot, new characters, intriguing philosophy and that classic Herbert style. However, this book contains some sexual elements that I found to be in poor taste. This was surprising given that the first four books contain nothing of the sort. I admit that I am a very scrupulous reader and have less tolerance for such things than most. Granted, such content is a very minor part of the book, but enough to leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth. If such content doesn't bother you, then this will be a four or five star book to you. All in all, it is worth reading and displays more of Herbert's genius."
1,Dune Jumps the Shark,I was not able to finish this book. I love the Dune series up to this point. And I still think Frank Herbert was a brilliant writer. I'm just not sure what he was going for here. I absolutely loved God Emperor of Dune. I thought that book was exceptionally well written. I really liked the characters in that novel. Especially Hwi Noree and Siona. Not to mention Leto II himself. That's why I was so dissapointed with Heretics. The way God Emperor ended was a perfect ending for this series. To explore the effects of The Scattering may have seemed like a good idea. But it's just too far away from what Dune was originally all about. And it's just not that interesting.
4,Promising,This one picks up the action a bit from God Emperor and promises more action for the last in the series. Definitely worth reading.
2,Yamabushi's mini reviews XXVI,"the worst of the Dune books, you keep reading, and reading thinking its got to get better and it never does. But its Dune, and Herbet Jr. Is already doing the sequels, and Chapterhouse is out there and you'll be lost. So put your head down and keep plugging away."
2,Eminently Unreadable,"To put it simply, herbert carries his esoteric writings a tad too far in this book. Up to this book, i loved the series. It was different, complex, yet not so esoteric that you couldnt catch glimpses of what was going on. All that changes in this book, however. There is nothing particlarly interesting here, since theres no fascinating main character (like Paul or Leto2) whose struggles and mental processes you actually care about. Nor is there an understandable plot (everything is vague, fuzzy). Herberts enigmatic dialogue is elevated to a particluarly abstruse level in this book. Maybe i'm not intelligent enough- but too much was unexplained, little was understandable and on the whole i had the feeling of reading a book in an almost-foreign language."
3,Should have stopped with 'God Emperor.',"Struggled many times to pick this book up, almost to no avail. Hate reading about just the Sisterhood. The priests on Rakkis are lame, too. Finally finished it, forgot about it immediately. Not sure why he wrote it. Oh well, at leasts it's Dune, right? Three stars because of good writing, but boring boring boooooring."
4,Slow to start but powerful ending,"I bought the entire collection of Frank's Dune books and sat and read them back to back while on vacation. I must say that it started off slowly, but about a quarter of the way in the story took off and I could not put it down. The Dune series, while I claim it to be one of my favorites, has kept me interested from the first book and on into Brian and Kevin's books about Dune."
2,Harley wallet comes up short on size,"This wallet has the same problem as other american wallets. The flip out view window is to small to hold a standard size drivers license. The license will fit into the window with some pressure, but don't try to get it out. I bought a European wallet by Dionigi from Amazon, and it works alot better for me. It's wider, which looks odd at first, but the extra size makes it flatter in my back pocket, and it fits a drivers license that is easily removable. The Harley wallet is well made and I like the logo as I am a rider. But, if you want to carry 4 or 5 credit cards,a drivers license that is easily removed from a display window, and have a thin wallet in your back pocket there are better choices."
4,Gift for Dad,"Birthday gift for my Dad. It's a very simple wallet. he said he couldn't carry all his cards, but didn't mind getting rid of the bulk. It says it has two cash compartments/pockets? But it doesn't. I had read it in a review and was aware before I purchased, so no big deal. As far as wallets go, definitely not my first choice. As Harley merchandise goes it's a pretty good deal."
3,disappointed,Delivery was quick but was disappointed with product was suppose to have the money divide and did not and that was what I was really looking for. So went to Harley in town and got a tri fold wasn't what he wanted but a much nicer wallet
1,A bloodfest tries to pass itself off as a novel.,"Carnage in New York was a slightly enjoyable romp that mainly involved a plot with Spider-man attempting to stop a deadly serum that will cause anyone exposed to it to go into a vicious killing frenzy, with said serum winding up in the hands of Carnage. The sequel involves a mysterious foe that could be Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, back from the dead(this takes place before that infamous clone saga really brought him back) stealing the serum and breaking Carnage back out of prison. Unfortunately, that's about it. The paper-thin plot is really just an poor excuse to showcase a horrendous amount of violence, bloodshed, and gore, and the unless you're a new-comer to Spider-man(you've only seen the movies, for example) the true identity of the main villain is incredibly obvious. Only masochists and extremely hardcore Spider-man fans should consider buying this tripe, the rest should stay away."
4,directors cut,"i was familiar with mike patton like most people, from faith no more. i know there are people out there that are obsessed with mike, they can do better with the history of this band or whatever. all i know is that this is a delightful release. the album is made up of theme songs from movies (some which i have seen, some i havent). these guys are so incredibly talented. dave lombardo on drums, cant go wrong there, buzz on guitars, trevor from mr bungle on bass, and mike patton on vocals. this album is completely insane. i love it. go check it out. very dynamic."
5,Fantomas scary then ever!,"What's scarier then Mike Patton's delicous gibberish songs? An album with 1 one hour song! I tell you if you were ever scared of Fantomas, Director's cut, then Delirium Cordia will scare the crap out of you! It has weird eerie feelings of surgical situatuions. Great to entertain yourself when your felling lousy. Thanks Mike!"
3,Good stuff.,This albums is deffiniatly innovative and different. Mike pattons vocals are amazing and also innovative. The music on this album is a collection of old songs from horror movie soundtracks. The music ranges a variety of emotions in sometimes very quick spans. For some reason even though this is a perfectly good peice of music I just dont dig it that much. Its not somthing I listen to very often at all. But thats just a matter of personal preference.
3,Weeping wails of inconsistency,"3 1/2Even if this album is as much, if not more, thrash-junkie annoying then it is melodically hard-hitting amazing, there are still so many great moments throughout this hot-and-cold affair of art-metal movie horror covers, so as to warrant many reassessments of favorite tracks (currently, I wish the first half of Twin Peaks was its own)."
2,Mediocrity disguised as experimentalism,"Firstly, I am a Patton fan and was eager for this album to come out but I'm a little disappointed. The interpretation of the themes is sub-standard compared to the originals.How many people are actually familiar with the originals? Maybe that's missing the point. But without the reference of the originals this album seems a little pointless.To simply speed things up and play them in a mock death-metal style, as they do on a number of songs, isn't very interesting or innovative or *gasp* avant-garde. It's PARODY and parody seems beneath the talent of this group. Too dangerously close to Weird Al territory for me. Great musicians, great choice of themes, great packaging. Mediocre execution. Bring on Tomahawk and Peeping Tom!!"
2,Technically perfect but craven,"Well, expletive. I like Mike Patton's work and think he's smart as hell, but when he turns his back on art like this in favor of triviality, I have to recommend avoiding this album. It's a hilarious implementation of these chile-con-queso themes, but the queso overwhelms and the only statement is a self-amused ridicule of life itself. I'd rather this assembly were to tackle an artistic project as Patton's track record is proven in this area, and it doesn't seem likely to me genius would fascinate itself with this technically precise but intellectually trivial endeavor."
4,Great book!,"Tells the story of the uprising and the massacre, along with color and black + white photographs. This book did a great job of explaining the events that took place in an easy to understand fashion."
3,It's all right,"Hth makes great chemicals, but this one tends to make your water a bit cloudy. I would go with a better HCH product"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! ZERO STARS!!,Long story short. Bought for daughter for Christmas...it is in the trash...This was THE WORST TOY/DOLL purchase ever!
4,A fun toy that my daughter loves,"All of the reviews I read about this toy indicated that it would not work properly or would break quickly. But my 6-yr-old daughter really wanted it, so I let her buy it with her own money. We haven't had a problem with it, and she really loves playing with it in the tub. It is a pretty doll and it wasn't too costly. Knowing the possibility that it would break, she has been careful with it, following the instructions included."
5,FUN,i just bought this doll and tried it out its swims perfectly its super fun i tied a small mermaid doll to it it still swims then i tied regular sized mermaid two then i went to the store and bought a nother one and its more than powerful when i tied two of the together and it swims good buy this doll its super fun
1,Not worth the money,"My daughter got this doll as a birthday present this past weekend and it doesn't swim. I'm glad I wasn't the one who bought it for her. She still enjoys playing with it in the water, I just wish it did what it said it would...swim!!!!"
2,Not OEM,"I know that Lexmark is no longer manufacturing this product, but I was hoping that someone still had some in storage. These ribbons work very well, but that are not as advertised. The OEM would work better on paper that is textured at all, this will break up a bit."
4,Good for schoool,Good book for school my daughter like it!She has to do a book report from it for her school.Easy to read for a 8 years old.
3,The book was O.K. however not very interesting.,The book was alright. I thought the book taught other people respect. I thought it was boring. I thought it was good for other people. However for me and my friend it was not a challenge. We are in fourth grade and read it with a group in four days.
5,Nydia is the best latin singer since the great Lola Beltran,"Nydia has a fabulous voice one of its kind. She can sing just about anything. I hope to hear more of her, she represents all the young new artist in the Latin community and is an inspiration to all. Unbelievable she is only 19 years of age, her voice is strong yet gentle. This CD should be a hit and top 1 in billboard!"
3,The title is misleading,"This book focuses more on helping someone identify whether or not they are in a relationship with a narcissistic partner rather than creating a satisfying relationship. It is beneficial for someone who is starting to explore this dynamic, to understand what the patterns are both in their partner and in themselves. However, the ""how to"" part is an afterthought and the message is that the creation of a satisfying relationship is beyond the scope of the book."
3,Just okay.,"It's just okay. Has sort of a victim point of view. Not what I was hoping for, but it may give some comfort to some people."
3,Worst Fears Reinforced,"I would suggest a new title: ""Surviving the Self Absorbed"" to be more accurate. Albeit, Brown states upfront that she assumes the decision to stay in the relationship has already been made. Yet, she uses the rest of the 182 pages to illustrate how a 'relationship' is impossible. Her descriptions of the roller coaster ride of living with a narcissist are right on, however, and the self-protection, insulation and detachment she suggests, beg the question, why would any sane person want to do this?"
3,Okay,"Nothing special.. Just pressed metal.I bought this to use for ashes for my new woodstove. Couldn't find what I wanted in ""sets"" so bought this and will use with a galvanized bucket I have. (Love galvanized metal). Wish the brass color was stronger.If I could have found this item in town I'd have bought it there. Hate to pay shipping cost that is close to half of the price of the item purchased."
5,Picked the Right One,"I purchased this for my daughter and had it shipped directly to her in another state. She suffers with memory and focus issues. However, after looking through it, she said ""you picked the right one."" So, I guess that means it is easy to read and understand.Not sure this review will help, but it was hard to pick the right book from the internet for a person with some learning issues."
5,"Grandson's Best ""Help"" Guide to the Military",My Grandson wanted to start early preparing for the military. He's only 13. He loves this book. He can follow the scenarios pretty easily. He says the reading is not too complicated to understand like some other guides we looked at.
5,What else can I say? I love this CD!,"This must be the most creative, amusing, brilliant cd I've ever heard. It is not only imaginative, but it is so well mixed that I feel like I'm sitting next to each and every muscian! What a truly magnificant collaboration."
4,Great song on album,"Bought the CD for the ""When I Said I Do"" song. Great song and used it for the first dance song in my wedding. This one has the right version (it's not the twangy one that is on the love songs album)."
5,D'Lectrified is nothing short of perfect.,"Clint Black has managed to create and record yet another exceptional CD. D'Lectrified is wonderful selection of music. All of the songs including the ones like Burn One Down that he has recorded previously have a fresh new sound that make them seem like all new songs, but at the same time it's like hearing an old favorite. Don't miss the chance to hear the best CD of the year or many years to come, buy D'Lectrified today you will not be disappointed."
5,Don't miss this one!,"Amazon.com reviewer Bob Allen is missing the point of this album. Perhaps he does not appreciate this style of music, but every track on this album is one of quality. Many reviewers named D'Lectrified one of the best if not the best country album of 1999. Don't miss out on this rare gem!"
5,This CD will make you feel good!,"I'm a new Clint Black fan. Especially after listening to D'lectrified. Like many others I bought the CD because of the beautiful duet he sings with his wife Lisa called ""When I Said I Do"". But I was delighted to find the rest of the CD to be fantastic. I especially enjoy the songs he did with other famous artists like Kenny Loggins, Steve Wariner and Bruce Hornsby. The song ""Harmony"" with Kenny is especially beautiful. If you ever get down in the dumps and you listen to this CD you won't be down any more. The songs are either beautiful or fun. You are missing out if you don't buy this one."
1,Waste of time,"This book is completely waste of time, at least not written for beginners in my opinion. Lesson's are not structured, does not talk about any basics.."
4,Sala's Gift book review,"I thought the book was very good. It was interesting to read all the letters that were written to Sala. It would have been nice if Sala had kept her red journal with her and wrote down what kinds of things were going on in the camps that she worked in, just to give a more insider look at life in the camps; to see her view. The book is excellent and does a good job of describing some of the aspects that occured during that time. When reading the book I was a bit surprised that they were even allowed to send and receive letters while in the camp. I was also surprised by the fact that some pictures were taken while Sala was in the camps and she got to keep them."
5,Beautiful and Amazing,"This story was so well-told. I could not put the book down. From beginning to end I was fascinated by the vivid descriptions and the horrific, yet engrossing progression of events. Kirschner, herself, has a gift for storytelling, and was able to deftly weave the historical details of the Holocaust into her mother's personal experience."
5,An Amazing Piece of History,"Anyone interested in the Holocaust/WW II will get a first-hand look at what people went through. It's unbelievable and the world is lucky that these letters, photos and mementos were saved through such turbulent times. Sala's Gift really is a gift to the world and her daughter who wrote it did an amazing job."
4,Sala's Gift,"I've read lots of books on the holocaust and while I rated Sala's Gift a four, I'd like to explain the reason. Sala was a wonderful and warm young lady and her sacrifice was beyond belief. However, to me the thing that kept it from being a five star was the fact that it was told in the second person by her daughter. I think it would have been much more intriguing had she told it herself. However, it was still a very interesting read."
5,How can you go wrong?,"I see another review that these are cheap plates, but I don't believe that to be true at all. However, I do treat my fine china with care and have not had a problem with any chipping or flaking.I have had this pattern since the early 1990s. It simply stands the test of time and is a classic. Trends in china come and go and this pattern will not.You just can't go wrong with Lenox and this pattern. I am planning to buy more and am happy to see it's still around!"
5,Lenox--American Excellence!,"We just purchased two more place settings of Lenox ""Eternal"" china. We've had this as our ""wedding china"" for over 40 years and have finally broken or chipped a couple of cups. Since we have larger groups for dinner, it seemed like a good idea to just have a couple extra plates and saucers, too.Really excellent, timeless china. We've never been sorry with our choice--and it is the basic pattern for the traditional Lenox Christmas china which we mix and match at the holidays!No doubt the best American product--and I think (!) it's made in the U.S.A.!"
5,Weeks Book a Triumph,"""A Reader from the United States"" couldn't be more wrong about""Gettysburg"" by Jim Weeks. It is the best discussion I've read of the evolution of an important historic site withiin the context of America's culture of consumption. It is especially good on the craze for ""authenticity"" that has developed since the 1970s, which is probably why ""Reader"" dislikes the book since he/she sounds like a reenactor. This is a worthwhile book that anyone interested in public history should read."
3,"Nicely organised, but...","It was very nicely organised, but I only got a 3 using it, which is my lowest ap grade. If had memorized every word, I would have done better, but I still read the whole thing and didn't do as well as I think I should have."
3,"Cover amazes you, song makes you question life","What thangs are he doin? Can't he be more specific? I tried to listen to the song dozens of times, and still can't find the answer. I suppose the song contains deep metaphor of what's going on in our lives, do we know what we are doing? Are we doing things? If everyone's been keeping us from doing our things, should we still do it?Doin thangs, I suppose, is about finding the meaning of your life while you get high with bears."
4,Nice change of pace from the author.,"I've got this when the author offered it as a discount, having read other books of his. Just like his other stories, good characters, a plot that keeps you interested and you can tell the author cares about his work and the charters. Different angle then some of his other books, but defiantly worth reading, even without the discount price. Unlike other books I've read I feel like I owe the author more for his work. Guess I'll have to grab his next release to make up for it."
4,"great read, would recommend!","I am not a teen, but a grandmother. However when I come across a book that sounds interesting and has great reviews I'm willing to try it out. I loved this book. Great story, great characters--Lucy was so easy to fall in love with. There are some grammatical errors but they were a minor distraction. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age who likes a good story."
4,The Last Chance Texaco,"I used this book with my middle school students. It is appropriate for 7th grade and up. The story gives readers a window into the world of foster care, and more specifically, life in a group home. The story was predictable and wrapped up too neatly, but in the end it was worth the read. My students (7th and 8th graders) enjoyed it."
4,Insight into Group Homes,"Brent Hartinger is just plain a good writer. I use Geography Club in an adolescent lit class that I teach at the college level. This is as well written as that one on a different topic. Even though the author tells us his time as a counselor is a group home was brief, this book has the ring of authenticity. There are all kinds of little insights that lets you know this is not someone who read about the topic or interviewed someone on the topic this is someone who lived it. The plot is a little shaky. If two cars were set on fire on the street wouldn't there be a neighborhood watch? Would the hot shot athlete really fall for the troubled girl from the group home? I did keep reading to to find out who the culprit was. The ending seemed idealized, but I think any reader will have gained insight into the group home situation."
5,"Engaging storyline, great graphics, can be very taxing!","If you thought X-Wing vs. TIE was good, you'll love this. You play the role of the son of a family caught up in the Rebellion. You start by flying missions for your family business. Eventually you can join the Rebellion and fly X-wings, A-wings, B-wings, and you even get the chance to fly the Millennium Falcon! The range of missions is great, and you can practise your skills in the simulator, or the pilot proving grounds. My only criticism is that some of the early missions are very tricky, and the difficulty does not always seem to increase in logical order."
5,The best Star Wars simulator to date!,"X-wing Alliance is the best flying game I've ever played. There are over 20 flyable craft and you can select which craft you want to fly and the ships that will be your enemy in the skrimish mode. Well worth the price, it also has a good story-line."
2,worst book ever,"I've used half of the book now. The layout is not very organized. I found the graphical representations useful.ok, 2nd semester in work. I'd prefer to downgrade this rating to negative 5 if I could. This book has turned into a major disaster. It is so riddled with errors...the derivations are never right. Everytime something doesn't work out right it's because the book is wrong. flat out.This book gets my strongest disapproval possible. Buying this book is throwing away your money. Thanks engel. Thanks for all those hours lost trying to figure out what mistake I had make working out the derivations in this book only to find the book was wrong all along.I'm still a little bitter about the false advertising when I got it...re: spartan software student copy that wasn't included."
2,Superficial and horribly written.,"This is a horrible book to read and gain any insightful knowledge from other than superficial, basic knowledge. If I wasn't a Chem E and didn't have a great teacher then I'd be in a world of complete confusion. This book does little more than use magic to derive equations and uses inconsistent conventions. In addition, it seems to spend a lot of time on specific thermodynamic examples then using mass and energy balances: the very staple of thermodynamics."
1,"Terrible, not helpful","I took my p-chem courses using both Engel books and were it not for my teacher I would have been completely lost. I started out reading before every lecture like I do in every course, but found that it actually hampered the learning process and I was better off just going to lecture and doing the homework.Additionally the solutions manual skips MAJOR steps and does not help understanding at all. I now do thermochemical calculations at work, and I just end up looking at my physics books for help.THANKS FOR NOTHING ENGEL.I am so glad I do not go to Univ of Washington.BTW I got an A and a B in P-chem, and A's in physics so I am not just mad at my score and taking it out on the book."
2,Confusion,"I found this textbook to be very difficult to understand. It's very frustrating when important concepts and examples are left to be learned by working homework problems. It's much better to have a firm foundation of understanding and then expand from that in the homework problems instead of attempting to develop that foundation through the problems. Some of my impression of this book is probably shaped by speed of the course (quarter system). The more I learn, the more sense this textbook makes; however, while it may be useful after the fact, I've found McQuarrie'sQuantum Chemistrytextbook to be much easier to follow for an initial introduction to a concept."
2,Supposedly New Textbook,"The product was ordered as New, but was received with damaged edges and scars on the front cover. Very dissatisfied."
4,Mello Cello,"I saw Marston perform at a street fair in the Palm Springs area last summer. He produces the most hauntingly beautiful sounds via his electric cello and you imagine yourself during the crusade period somewhere in England.This album features soundtracks of current and classic films. Martson stated that his personal favorite was ""Stairway to Heaven"" mine is the Zorro theme."
5,Detailed & Factual,I give this book five stars because it is packed with facts. It highlights the major personalities in the history of African American golf (male & female). It is written in an encylopedic like form but it is still very good. The author does an excellent job sharing the story of so many of those who fought for us to have a right to play. A must read! I learned a lot from this book. I highly reccomend it!
2,"Good Subject, But ...","I read golf 10 to 12 golf books a year and I was looking forward to reading Forbidden Fairways. Unfortunately, I read Forbidden Fairways after reading John Kennedy's A Course of Their Own. In my opinion Kennedy's book has a better flow to it and has been better researched. Both books were well intended, but I thought A Course of Their Own was a more entertaining read."
1,B-17 Flying Fortress,"I have bought two of this game, same problem with each. Should run on windows xp but won't even using compatibility mode. On line to Tech Support, they suggested many fixes, none of which worked, their final soulution was to try it on another computer. The windows xp I have is very powerful but it can't get either game to even start?I am very disapointed, realy loked forward to flying my Father's aircraft."
1,Upset,"I have Windows 7. When I placed the CD in my computer, it downloaded a Whitney Houson album. Enough said."
4,A Search for Meanining and Fulfillment,"Alan Sherwood is the protagonist living an ordinary and simple existence, yet he longs for passion and excitement in his life. The novel presents this search for meaning and fulfillment in the lonely world Alan lives in. Yet, ultimately there is no meaning in life. I could strongly relate to Alan's search for excitement and passion in his life. The characters and story give this novel a strong sense of melancholy and loniness thoughout.This is definitely a novel to be savored, but it also leaves you with a bleak sense of the future."
3,Love as Manic-Depression,"Being diagnosed as a manic depressive in the midst of an incredible and irrational love affair much as Allan Sherwood experienced with Sarah, I believe the ""altered states"" Brookner is refering to is a biochemical imbalance rather than a human condition, something a little prescription might heal. Or, at least, in America, that is the way things go. Although wonderfully written and fraught with internal and interpersonal conflict, Brookner fails to leave a sense of closure with the reader. Her inability to take a stand for or against love seems to stem from the elusiveness of that existential angst her characters live in and move through. I read this book with intensity and have been left with no answers, only questions."
4,"unique, and literary","I think that the novel was over all very well written, but I wish there could have been more descriptions of Sarah. I enjoyed the way Brookner described the realtionship of the mother and son."
4,New spin on old story,Telling the story through the eyes of four different players made the story new again.Once again the inability to communicate changes the possible outcome.
1,Shameful,"Evan Thomas should be ashamed of himself for his attempted character assassination of Admiral Halsey, a true American patriot. Thomas dwells on every conceivable character flaw, real and imagined, significant or not, of Halsey. Do we really need to know about his bedroom behavior after the war?Every American owes Halsey their gratitude and respect. In retrospect with the benefit of hindsight, every commander who takes action is imperfect. The fact remains (and is virtually ignored in this pitiful book) that Ozawa's carrier fleet was destroyed, hastening the end of the war."
5,A Fresh Perspective on WWII in the Pacific,"The author looks at our struggle with the Japanese through a new prism with four facets, each of which is a leader. This device enables him to reflect both nations, their cultures, and differing leadership styles. Thus is seasoned journalist Evan Thomas able to shed new light on a much discussed subject, encompassing the essence of the Pacific conflict in only 350 pages."
4,A good story,I did not know as much about the battle before this book. Thomas gives an excellent perspective of all sides of the battle. I felt I was a bit oversold on the book and it did not live completely up to expectations which is why I only give it 4 out of 5.
2,Kindle Readers Beware!,"Not formatted correctly for your kindle. Lots of readability issues, missing punctuation and scanning errors, leading to 100's of misspellings and non sequiturs. Amazon was good enough to refund my money. Great book, but get it in print. I have noticed even recently published books having the same issue, fewer but still. Amazon needs to get to work on proofing these books before the place them on SALE! inexcusable!"
5,I WAS THERE !!!!,"On October 25, 1944, I was an air crewman on an Avenger assigned to the CVE ""St Lo"" of Taffy 3 off Samar! How do I remember so well? It's a day burned forever into my memory, and it was my 18th birthday. While the book leaves some room for accuracy, it does tell the overall story with clarity. We were able to launch and to deliver a torpedo to a Jap cruiser, and then we made several fake runs before being shot down. We didn't make it back to the ship, and I ended up in the cold, shark infestwd sea in sight of my ship. I saw her death and that of my shipmates. I expected no less. But I survived Samar and Okinawa by the Grace of God. I'm now 80, and time takes its toll. I have no regrets other than that the sacrifices then are forgotten, and now that the political and stupid idiots don't support our troops in a very difficult and most important mission to protect this country! GOD BLESS AMERIDCA!!!!"
3,Read 'Last of the Tin Can Sailors' instead,"This is a good read as an adjunct to the other book, but 'Last' is better. It is often referenced in this book, and for good reason. This book delves into the mind set of the Japanese sailor, but their 'fight to the death' mentality has already been explored many times before."
3,Imus you let me down,"I usually pick up what I hear on Imus. I heard the interview with Evan Thomas and ran to get this the day it was published. Probably could have waited til the movie came out. If you put this in the ""FlyBoys"" genre, you made a mistake. It is OK, but it is a tedious read in my humble opinion. You are waiting for meat, waiting for a thick steak, and you get thinly sliced baloney. I just think it could have been told in a more interesting fashion. Halsey comes out to look like an egomaniac. The Japanese navy looks horrible and I can't say how this book paints the Japanese people to look. Gullible is probably the word to use. That makes for an interesting read but overall I thought this could have been better. I guess if you like WWII naval history, this is OK, but, it ain't no ""FlyBoys""."
4,Gripping,"An era of chivalary unmatched since then. The author describes in detail the glory and the folly of war and why we should preserve what ever little ""peace"" we have left. It's a debt which we owe to the known and unknown masses who paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom and peace.Congratulations to the author and very well done"
5,Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the Last Great Naval Campaign 1941-1945,A lot of fun to read. Readers who are familar with Leyte Gulf will enjoy this book as it fills in lots of blanks. Casual readers who are not so familar with the battle would do well to start here but will want to follow up with other books on the subject.
5,No Bull...,"It's no wonder were in the mess we are, when myoptic vision clouds reason.This was not a hit on Halsey..Duoh! This was a very good read. Maybe Ken burns took some info here?I see a lot of whinners(on other forums) saying the Japanese never had a plan to sue for peace if they took Hawaii..(?)Any way Good book.Thanks, Mr Evans"
3,CORRECTION to Thomas' text,"Evan Thomas incorrectly states that Admrial Spruance's son married Admiral Halsey's daughter. In fact, Margaret Halsey married Preston Lea Spruance who was only distantly related to Admiral Spruance.- Halsey Spruance, a decendant of Margaret Halsey and Preston Lea Spruance"
3,A Different Perspective,"Sea of Thunder was an interesting history of the latter part of the naval war in the Pacific during WWII. The author looked at the lives of four leaders, 2 American and 2 Japanese and how their lives developed and how they affected the battles in whihch they were engaged. It added to the understanding of why theses sea battles went in the direction they did. It was an easy reading book and an enjoyable biography of 4 men doing their duty as they saw it."
2,"Book was ""Worn"", not ""New"" as described","Product was listed in ""New condition"" and arrived in ""Worn condition"". As this was supposed to be a gift, I was forced to purchase an alternative item. Would not buy from this user again."
3,I was not impressed,"I think that 14.99 should be the actual price of this jacket. It is not worth more. I have returned it because I expected something similar to the picture, but it was not even close. Maybe it is just me!"
1,"measurements were off, had to return.","not up to size stated in description, bowl was much smaller and too small for my purposes. I had to return it"
2,for scrappers not punch artists,"This book has great photos of scrapbook layouts & the use of punch art in the layout, BUT.. the detail photos of the actual coloring of your punch art are only about the size of a quarter. I bought the book to see how to color my punch art & use it in various applications. The images are so small it makes it difficult to see where color was applied & how. The written descriptions are very brief & deal mostly with laying out the scrapbook page & not with the actual coloring steps used. I was disappointed. I expected more emphasis on the coloring of the punched items. A beter title might have been ""Scapbook Layouts with Punch Art""."
1,Doesn't fit Kenmore 14804,"I purchased this filter D18-C, and to my dismay it is 1"" too tall to fit my Kenmore humidifier 14804. I had to cut an inch off the top just to be able to use it in the humidifier. This is by no means a judgment on the quality of the filter, just that it doesn't fit the model specified it would."
4,interesting,"i believe there are certain topics that you need to discuss with a potential mate/significant other, and this book seems to be the middle ground between where you are now and where you will be later on. a promising informational book."
1,"Don't quit your day job, Wynton","Wynton Marsalis breezes through the gamut of Second Grade literary formats (Acrostic, Gibberish, Shape Poem) before devolving into fractious purplisms. This serious of tributes to jazz icons is more of what we've come to expect from Mr. Marsalis: Lugubrious idolatry, trumpeted from the peak of Mt. Wynton.As with his mind-numbing dissertations on Ken Burns's jazz documentary, Mr. Marsalis presents two central theses in his poetry that are very damaging to the genre. There are:a) You have to understand it to enjoy it, andb) You have to worship it to talk about it.Apart from offering another volume to the jazz nerd catechism, it's difficult to image how this book will in any way promote the music itself. But then again, as Marsalis notes, ""Mingus might just talk about your momma, then go 'head and manifest a masterpiece by midnight. By moonlight. Maybe."""
1,Why would anyone pay this price?,$16.75? Why would anyone pay this price? It costs about $3-4 dollars in the grocery store. I don't get it.
2,Good for you but tastes awful,"Wish I could say something more positive about this cereal because it's healthful and high in fiber. Unfortunately, getting it down is quite a trial since the taste and texture result in something awful. Putting in something extra-raisins, butter, cinnamon-helps."
2,Doesn't support my Nikon raw format and the tech support sucks,"purchased psp studio recently and it wasn't able to open my nikon raw files (though the package says it does). I tried calling the tech support and was on hold for more than 30 mins listening to how upgrading to their premium support would be of great value and finally gave up and hung up the phone.And one more thing, the tech support is not a toll free number and i was on hold for more than 30 mins on a long distance call."
1,problematic install and wants to reinstall,"I have used older Paint Shop Pro versions for years without issue but this version has serious installation problems in that is constantly tries to reinstall itself. After hunting for security products on my computer that would have modifiend the files to make it think it needs to be installed again I found none. Tech support was useless (the usual reponses, ""are you logged on as and administrator"", etc.) as they didn't really read my email about the problem and just sent ""cut-and-paste"" responses to general computer problems. Then the tech support people got rude and told me to ""figure out the problem yourself"". There is a reason why this software is almost free."
5,Laugh 'til you cry,"I saw the original when it first came out (in French with subtitles.) I laughed so hard I cried, and went back several times to take friends who would also laugh hysterically. Even my mother almost feel on the floor when she saw it on television. I have searched for it for years..."
4,Tall Blond Man ...,"Many years ago we had seen this movie, enjoyed it so much that we rented it many times, shared it with friends, etc. When we decided to buy this movie, it was no longer available. Lately we were thinking about the film and found it through Amazon and ordered it at The Movie People. The VHS arrived quickly, if it had been viewed in the past (which we doubt) it was done carefully. What a joy to see this delightful film again, and any time we crave a bit of that wonderful French sensibility."
1,Don't get fooled.,The playlist on this cd reads very well. The tunes on this cd have been terminated abruptly and then the next tune immediately starts. This cd might make a good dancercise cd but is not for a serious tune collector.
3,A Good Gentle Start,This is a very sensitive book. The couple is gentle in their terminology and not likely to scare a person new to magick or energy exchange away.Much of our culture looks at sex as carnal and bad no matter how loving or monogamous the relationship. This book gently introduces the reader to healing those feelings about sex in a positive way.This book is going to disappoint any practiced magicians or tantrics but it is a very good book to introduce people to a new broader way of loving their partner and sharing in the sexual experiance together.
2,Kama Sutra Lite,"With an easy to follow ""1970-ish mumbo-jumbo"" the authors detail happy and robust sexuality. At the end of the book the authors spill over into sexual practices that are too often unilateral, unsanitary and exploitive. The book is likely to seem careless and disappointing to those who believe that great sex involves sacred intimacy and a marriage covenant rather than just the mutual permission of the two. Some will find the absence of explicit pictures a plus, others a minus."
1,A Shock,"While it is true that we in the West have very disturbed notions about sex and sexuality, it should be kept in the mind that genuine Tantra harnesses the most powerful energies in the human organism: the creative forces. If you use these energies to create more lust, more attachment, more false security, then quite simply you are deepening your suffering. The sexual energy can enslave or it can redeem; but are you sure you know the difference? For more information, read the works of Samael Aun Weor, especially ""The Perfect Matrimony"" (0974275506) and ""The Mystery of the Golden Blossom."" (0974275522)"
3,a good introduction to tantra,"For beginners perfect introduction , but not much insight very few exercices.however just for ""secret of a longer deeper higher orgasm on page 116 and the last 10 pages, this book should be read.i suggest mantak Chia work, more basic, praactical less romantic.Enjoy"
4,My niece loved it.,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 5 year old niece. She loves the chair. I thought it was slightly better than the ones I saw for sale in the large chain discount stores for about the same price. the padding seems a little thicker and the fabric of a better quality. The only downside I've seen is it may not be the most sturdy of children's chairs, it may be inclined to wobbling some. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
5,Very descriptive,This book comes in handy for herbal remedies. Very informative and colorful and illustrated with lots of pictures. A very good resource for those who are trying to discover natural remedies for various ailments.
5,Different methods of alternative medicines w/ pictures of the product,"This book is very detailed and to the point. It has talked about different methods of alternative medicines (traditional, Chinese, Ayurveda etc.). The book is categorized based on most common health symptoms and then discussed how they are treated based on different methods. I love how they used picture illustration (not hand drawn) for each of the ingredient. Overall, it's a good book to have for common everyday household medicine. If you wish to treat them naturally. Even my physician father is impressed by this."
5,Great seller,Great seller. the shipping was really fast and the book was as described. It doesn't describe how to prepare infuses or exactly how to use many of the herbs but is really well done and gives great descriptions and details
5,Found what I needed,a friend of mine loaned me his Illustrated Encyclopedia of Healing Remedies book and I found the answer to a health issue immediately. Tried the treatment it recommended and within a couple of days I saw great improvement. It is easy to read and it was easy to find what I was looking for. A wealth of knowledge here. It was such a wealth of knowledge I had to buy it for my own library.
5,Pairs excellent color photos with practical advice,"This specific guide is a 'must' for any involved in the captive breeding of tarantulas. It originally appeared in German and here enjoys an English translation and an update, providing a blend of introductory details on the tarantula's life and natural history and specific requirements of keeping tarantulas in captivity. From bites to tarantula diseases and accounts of 40 of the more commonly kept species, Tarantulas In The Vivarium pairs excellent color photos with practical advice."
2,"Great picture, lousy service","The monitor has a beautiful, crisp image. Perfect for my work (CAD, development, web surfing). It also has a neat feature: it will accept 2 DVI inputs from 2 computers and then allows you to toggle between computers with a button on the front panel. Sadly, this feature stopped working after roughly 8 months of use.When I called HP to claim a warranty repair, I was transferred to a service agent in another country. After 20 minutes of repeating and correcting serial numbers/model numbers I was told that this monitor was not in their database and therefore I could not be helped. What the heck! I offered to email pictures of the model number sticker, fax copies of the invoice, etc. All to no avail, the ""service"" representative declined my request to speak with a manager to resolve the issue. So I guess I'm just stuck with a half-broken product.In the end, it's still a nice monitor, but I'm frustrated with the lack of customer service."
3,two DVI but only one USB,"This monitor is incapable of functioning as KVM switch replacement, because there is only one USB input.If you play games this monitor isn't for you. Some reviews indicate that it is unable to support even 60 frames/sec. A decent CRT has no problem with >100 frames/sec."
5,Awesome door mat!,"Received the mat very quickly. Don't throw away the instructions without reading, they are hilarious! Nice mat, sturdy and has kept a lot of the sand out (Florida). Has washed well too. It is not thick but does the job."
5,"Wow, I can't believe audiovox didn't have a winner with this one",What a great idea...1 lcd dvd player with many attachments. Move it from you kitchen(with under counter mount/cable tuner) to you car (ceiling mount or headrest adapter).
3,Pretty Cool,"Okay this game does habe its drawbacks: lame voice overs, poor graphics, and difficulty with control. It also has its good sides: STAR WARS (duh), piloting and blowing the snot out of every thing (even wingmen), and tons of missions. The easiness of destroying enemies pales to lets say, Rogue Squadron, and its tricky to shoot enemies.Missions vary from taking out small fighters, or taking on star destroyers, or escorting freighters. Some missions can be long and boring and impossible.Only for die-hard Star Wars Fans, like you and me. -Jake"
2,Not worth the money,"While it is a cute toy, it is not worth the money. [...] I purchased it for my grandson for Xmas & it is not what I would consider a ""floor"" puzzle. It is not much bigger than an ordinary puzzle. I once bought a life-size (kid life-size) Bob the Builder puzzle which my other grandson enjoyed immensely. I thought this was what was meant by a ""floor"" puzzle. This was nothing like that one!"
4,Not your usual tough-guy cop story but a human one.,"This story, told in the first person, is an imaginative and interesting look at what a New York City detective really is...a human being with human frailties. It is also a really good mystery. I look forward to more from Mr. Dee."
3,pointless story,"I liked Dee's writing, I just didn't like the story. I mean who cares who killed that cop? It was ten years ago plus he was a bad cop, in bed with the ""mob"". What's the point? And if you haven't figured it out in ten yrs..... I didn't make it past page 38.I will try another one of Ed Dee books tho. One with a mystery I can care about solving."
3,Ed Dee is fun,This was an old fashioned book that was fun to read. It was more like a good TV show than a well written novel. The characters were good but not great. I have not spend any time since I finished this wondering what happened to any of them. I would not pick up another book from Dee unless trapped in an airport and it was the only choice.
5,Uncluttered and real,"This is a great read. Uncluttered by pointless backstories or lame attempts to emulate RB Parker's humor, so common among the mass market crime stories. Clean dialogue. Realistic as only a 25 year cop could make it. Solid character development, both good guys and bad guys. Good plot twists. Just about anyone would like this book."
2,*NOT DURABLE,"tHIS DVD PLAYER GAVE ME AND MY THREE YEAR OLD A LOT OF PROBLEMS. tRUE IT'S CUTE AND, CONVENIENT (FOR A WHILE), BUT wE GOT IT FOR HIM FOR CHRISTMAS THIS PAST YEAR AND IT'S ALREADY BROKEN. mY SON DOES LOVE IT AND HE'LL MORE THAN LIKELY GET ANOTHER ONE, AND ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER (ONLY BECAUSE IT MATCHES HIS TV AND ONCE AGAIN, HE LOVES IT). i SAY SAVE YOUR MONEY OR PREPARE TO BUY MORE THAN ONE, AND BE SURE TO GET YOUR WARRANTY FULFILLED. i WAS WARNED BEFORE i GOT IT BUT i JUST WANTED HIM TO HAVE IT AND SURE ENOUGH IT BROKE."
1,Never recieved the item!!!!!!,I really difficult to write a review when I never received a product that has been charged to my credit card!!!!!
4,Grand Love in the old (pre code) style,"A dying Society lady, a dashing, doomed outlaw on the run, an ocean voyage. This classic, tear jerker shows how Hollywood did it in the classic, romantic style.Kay Francis and William Powell have that Style we hardly see anymore. Suave, elegant, each with their own secret that can't be revealed until...With smooth con artists, Aline MacMahon and Frank McHugh.Watch for those shattered cocktail glasses."
4,Date Correction,This film was made in 1932. It was RE made- with Merle Oberon- in 1940. The 1932 version is generally judged to be the best.
5,Rae's personal life gets more complicated,"Finally Rae kissed Anthony. Finally they realize that they like eachother. THings should be going great right? Wrong. In this book Rae can't seem to get close to Anthony thanks to her ex-boyfriend Marcus. To make things more difficult, her best friend Yana, won't even speak to her anymore. For some strange reason she thinks Rae told Yana's father about the whole ""ballet story"" and will do anythign to get back at her. Rae's still trying to find out the thruth about her mother and why she died and the truth about Amanda Reese. And there's only one person who possibly knows the answer. But trying to talk to him is risking her life.I thought that this was a great book in the series. It's starting to remind me of the early books in the fearless series. If you're a fan of the series I reccomend reading this book. THough it isn't as good as the last one it's still an amazing edition. I hope you enjoy it!"
4,"Good Book, but...","Although I'm addicted to the Fingerprints series, after reading this book, I was beginning to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with Rae's brain. I mean, who in their right mind would go straight to a hotel room after being instructed to do so by someone they don't know?Anyway, that set aside, the series again proves itself to be an intruiging one. The characters are continuing to develop, and Metz throws in many interesting and unexpected plot twists. Worth reading =)"
2,"Alas, the Drama","First of all, let me just say that I was LOVING this series. Until this book came out. Melinda Metz decends into completely contrived melodrama with Anthony, Rae, and Yana that would try the patience of a Mexican soap opera.Yana gets a letter telling her dad how upset she was about some ballet thing when she was in grade school, so she just assumes that Rae sent it. To get back at her--*why?*--Yana goes after Anthony, who conveniently left all his brain cells at Fillmore with his pot-smoking friends. I say that because he doesn't seem to be thinking very much in this book.Whereas in the other books Anthony and Rae were friends, in this book they hardly talk to one another. Not to mention that just about everything else in this book seems contrived. There's a lot of the plot to kill Rae going on, but really, who cares about that? I hope Metz gets Anthony and Rae back together again soon so that the series can get back on track."
3,Low resolution,"The painting itself is beautiful, but the poster lacks some resolution - it doesn't look like the source image was meant to be blown up to 24x36. If you're getting the poster so you have some classy art up, or want to study the details of the picture, this isn't the way to do it."
2,SONGS ARE ORIGINAL,GAVE THIS AS A GIFT. THE SONGS ARE VERY OLD AND ORIGINAL. MY BOYFFRIEND LIKE ONLY ONE SONG THAT IS VERY WELL KNOWN.
1,Universal ?? My sweet patootie!,"IT DOESN'T FIT! It arrived quickly & I was so excited.IT DOESN'T FIT! I challenge anyone to get it to work on the rear hatch strut of a 2001 Toyota Celica GT. Thexton should have bored the hole out more. What a bunch of MORONS.Hey, Thexton-- why don't you fix the problem & send me a couple for free?"
4,"Great, but pricey",Nice size. Standard Pyrex durability. But $5.99 for a 1-cup container? It's overpriced.
4,"Great storage container, but pricey","I love these for storing leftovers, baby food, etc and the size is great for small portions for my toddler and infant. The best thing is that it's glass so you can pop it in the microwave without worrying about plastic leaching into your food. I just wish it wasn't so pricey - otherwise, I would buy 5 more!"
3,Melba,"I can only give 3 stars because of comparing this to Melba Levick's In a Mexican Garden, which has far more interesting and gorgeous photographs."
5,Broan 505 fan,"Perfect fan for my purposes, using it as a bathroom/shower exhaust fan (10'X10'bathroom),sure it's a bit loud by ""sone"" standards however it's actually not even an issue....in fact, I like the soft humming as a reminder so it's less likely to be left on. Very impressed and happy with this fan....price was right too !!!"
4,Powerful Fan,"Installation is a bear, crawling around in the attic full of blown insulation, but once installed, it's a great fan. It is extremely powerful, the steam in the bathroom doesn't stand a chance. All that power does come with a trade-off though; the fan is quite loud."
4,"Great fan, but incorrect Specs...","Excellent fan. I am replacing the same model, which was installed 15 years ago. It is a little loud. Bothers my wife, but not me...so I like it.The description says it is 180 CFM (How much air it moves). This number is correct. The description also says it is 5.5 sones (This is how much noise it makes. The lower the number, the more quietly it operates). This number is WRONG. When you receive the product, you will see that the box and spec sheet are clearly marked that it is 6.5 sones. If that is a deal breaker for you, be aware, otherwise, happy fanning.Told my wife that I would install it on the weekend. I will actually get to it by Tuesday."
3,it works,I like the way it makes it easy to make french brewed coffee.I just wish the seal were a little thicker so as not to let the coffee grounds through.and if you fill it up to the top that is even harder to keep the grounds below the seal.Tip> Fill half way then put top on then fill the rest of the way.
5,I love this product!,This product fits nicely into my hand. You can even take the outer layer off to make the cup a little smaller and lighter and still not burn your hands. Great for any tea or ground coffee. Everything stays warms for a few hours. I love this product. I use it everyday.This is a social writeup.b2lopez
4,Bodium travel mu mug press,"I love this travel mug press. Makes a great cup of coffee on the go. Not realizing before I purchased it, if you use sugar in your coffee, might be a little difficult to add cause you once you press it, you don't take the lid back off to be able to stir. Fortunately for me, I only use cream, so I just pour it thru the little sip hole in the top and swirl. Otherwise, great item."
1,Don't waste money on this leaking bottle,"I bought this bottle from a bodum outlet in Denmark but I soon found that water would leak through the small hole in the lid. I asked the staff at the outlet and they said it is SUPPOSED to be LEAKING. How can a bottle named ""Travel"" Press be supposed to leak? I am totally disappointed with bodum."
1,Expected better from such a well-known brand,"I've tried coarsely ground and very coarsely ground, yet I still end up with coffee grinds in my mouth. Very disappointed with this product.Only good thing is, it does seem to keep your drink hot for a fair amount of time. That's it."
1,travel mug doesn't really work,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift and unfortunately, this product is quite a disappointment. The actual rubber ring on the plunger doesn't form a tight enough seal thus, there are coffee grounds/loose tea leaves contaminating the entire cup. It is completely unusable and will now sit on a shelf as the person for whom I purchased the gift feels guilty in throwing it out!"
4,"Nice Concept, does the trick","The cup looks great and functions well. I mostly use it for loose leaf tea instead of coffee, but it does the job and the tea leaves stay at the bottom thanks to the mesh separator. The only issue I had with this was that it broke very easily, not the glass, but the seal that joins the two glass pieces towards the top, came undone, when the cup slipped from my hand. But I really liked it, so ended up ordering a second one. I love making tea in it"
2,"Loved it, Worked Great, Broke Easy","First of all, it works, the filter is what you would expect for the price. It's easy to clean, and keeps your coffee warm and your coffee grinds out but make sure you really do have coarse ground coffee, if any of the grinds are too small they'll definitely sneak through on the sides of the filter.The only complaint is I only got to use it twice before it broke. fell 3 feet onto concrete and it totally separated. Seemed like it should've been a litle more sturdy. Treat it like it's glass."
3,not the greatest but functional to a degree,"You can never get the last 2 ounces of coffee out of this thing. I own several bodums and this is the worst of the lot. Grounds are always in my coffee.....It just isn't that great, but it works...Other then these two things, its great.....It should be cheaper for what it is tho.We did receive it promptly and it was in new condition. The issues we have with it have nothing to do with the seller."
2,Weak external body,"Within 2 weeks of receiving this press, the external shell broke when I dropped by backback on the floor at home. I imagine it was a book or two pressing in on it. However, the break is located at the bottom edge of the press, presumably one of the stronger areas (impact wise).In any case, I've learned my lesson - next travel press I buy will be steel."
4,It's great...,I use this Monday - Friday it allows me to drink good coffee at work. I'm a black coffee drinker so this works for me. I guess if you need cream or sugar you've got to pour it in a cup. This is my third one of these in 3 years. They tend to crack so I'm looking forward to the new stainless steel version.
5,georay,"make sure to hold plunger up all the way before screwing the lid on,then you can use plunger!!! works great!!!"
5,Works Great,"I bought this to replace an earlier version that had just plain worn out. This new model is much improved. Nice size, sturdy plastic and it does well at trapping the grounds. Good product if you are looking for a travelling coffee press."
1,Perfect for wearing your coffee!,"Buying this was a mistake, I was so excited, until I realized that the seal doesn't work properly. 5 tips back and coffee ran onto my blouse only 15 minutes into the workday. Grrr...."
2,Coffee grounds anyone?,"Everyone who has ever tried french pressed coffee falls in love...what better than a tumbler & french press in one?! It has a lot of asthetic appeal but the seal on the plunger is sub-par. I have yet to make a cup of coffee in it without having a mouth-full of coffee grounds. That's a deal-breaker for me, but if you don't mind a little ""coffee"" with your coffee, it's not too bad."
2,Bodum 16 oz insulated travel coffee press,"This was given as a gift. The first time it was used, it was accidently dropped and broke into pieces. Not very sturdy for a ""travel press""."
1,"Different image from actual book - It is a lab book, not the real text book","I wanted to buy the real Chemistry text book. The image of the item showed the front page of the real book. But when the book arrived, it was a lab manual, not the real book. Its front page was not the same as shown on this item's page. Description of the item also didn't say it was a lab manual. It had the same title as the main book with (Paperback) in paranthesis. There is a small one line which says 'Pearson Prentice Hall; Lab Manual edition (January 2002)' but that was not clear that it is only a lab manual, not the book with lab manual.Original book is awesome. Perhaps one give away is that this item (the lab manual) costs 17.75 while the text book costs about $100. But I think Amazon should clearly mark that this is a lab manual and not the actual text book.I returned the lab manual."
1,I felt being cheated!,"The advertised picture is for the textbook. Therefore, I clicked to buy, but I received the lab booklet (that was used for the textbook), and its quality was fit for recycle. I felt being cheated."
1,Be careful!! The posted picture is wrong!!!,"The posted picture is for the text book, if you order by the picture from gabookcompany, you will get a LAB MANUAL."
3,"The book's ""complete"".....but my satisfaction isn't!!","I am giving this book 3 stars because of all the long and tedious work put into it, and all its great pictures, most of which cannot be found elsewhere. Also, the list with details about all the memorabilia available is very useful. But I found that the episode descriptions were not very accurate. If I remember correctly, this is because the summaries are based on the scripts and not the actual episodes (as they were broadcast) of the show. I recommend buying it if you are a huge fan of the show; just don't rely on the book for accuracy."
3,Full Story Avengers?,"Although a thorough book, it's written rather academically and is therefore a bit boring. I wish there were color pictures to accompany 'The Avengers in Color' portion. Also, a section on costuming would have been nice. It was interesting to learn that Diana Rigg requested elimitating her leather catsuits once the color season began, because she thought leather was more indicative of the Cathy Gale character (Emma Peel's predecessor). I always loved Emma in leather!"
4,Be Sure To Check it Out,"George Russell, who passed away on July 27, 2009, shows us a postcard from Eric Dolphy on his official homepage but I don't think Dolphy's phrasing relates to Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept.I found Eric Dolphy's Synthetic Formations (given to Yusef by Eric Dolphy in 1961) ideas on p.15 and Geometric Drawings by John Coltrane (given to Yusef by Coltrane in 1960). This thesaurus is a must for all musicians.Be sure to check it out. List $30."
5,touching and sweet,"This is a truly sweet and touching collection of stories about love, good conduct, trust, and living fully. One of the main themes is following your ""highest right"" and basing your actions on this ideal. In short, these stories are excellent entertainment and also provide good food for thought."
5,"Curious Lives: Adventures from ""The Ferret Chronicles","I am still reading Curious Lives, but what I have read so far I love. I have enjoyed Richard Bach Books before. Up until Curious Lives my favorite book was and still is Jonthan Livingston Seagull."
4,Nice CD of some slightly unusual pop Christmas classics,"Not as quirky as Dr. Demento's Christmas album, but not as traditional as Time-Life's Christmas album. The ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" with Ann Margaret and Al Hirt is sexy and will warm you up! Good, standard tunes.The only disappointment was the Auld Lang Syne -- very odd voiceover over an instrumental of the traditional New Year's song. Interesting, but it's definitely not something you'll be singing along to.This CD is a very nice addition a well-rounded Christmas music selection."
3,Interesting... but not all it is molded up to be,"Okay, think of playing with colored rice krispies right when they are still warm and you are trying to make them into shapes. It has that same feel. But doesn't dry out, harden or leave a residue on your hands.The problem is that it doesn't stay together well either. I pulled it out today for my 3 and 5 year old. They got excited! They played... and in moments other colors were slowly merging. They tried to build things and keep the colors separate but it was nearly impossible. It was about 30 minutes or so of interest. Bought a tub to keep it all in since it doesn't come with anything for good storage. I can see how it will crumble. Hope it is less mess then the play moldable sand. That was a mess. But I think maybe we should stick with play-doh. At least that is cheap enough that I can throw it away when needed. We'll pull this out again but not sure it is worth the $20 cost."
3,Great Old Skool Cd Reggaeton,Esto Esta Bestial En Estilos Es Uno De Los Cds Del Underground Muy Buen Mezclado y Con Artistas Que Ya Ni Estan En El Genero Pero No Le Quita El Estilo Al Cd.
4,Great Primer!,"If you're looking for a place to start to understand Supply Chain Management--this is the book. The authors, who have done an outstanding job on the research--lots of research, have explained in a very down to earth and articulate way--the great need for SCM, the challenges, the roadmap to begin the journey, and what the future holds. A great ""why to and how to book""."
1,High level rip off,I'm not a Supply Chain professional yet I found this book too conceptual and simplistic. A concept book needs to at least be thought provoking. It is not. [....]
2,Not My Cup of Tea,Not a big fan of the works of Ellis. This one is no exception. Hard to understand and hard to finish the book.
4,I am not smart enough,i might have come up with a few phrases that helped me understand quantum theory in the midst of complicated formulas but they were few and far between. this book is written for the scientist who is adept in advanced mathematics and physic theory.this guy will get back to it but for now it is on the shelf. bw
5,Typical juvenile novel - but with echoes of Kennedy assassination - a year before!,"This is your typical series book for boys, very comparable to the Hardy Boys, just as good, not better. What interested me the most is that the plot concerns an assassination attempt (on a foreign dignitary visiting Manhattan), and as I read the details it constantly evoked memories of the Kennedy assassination, with haunting similarities, like the authors description of a convertible in a motorcade, and the assassins plan to shoot the passenger with a rifle from a building along the route. This coincidence kept me interested and made the book seem more worth reading. Since this was written in 1962, one year before the president's tragic end, one can't help wonder if Lee Harvey Oswald might have read this book."
2,Looks GREAT....BUT,"I purchased this item through a suggestion in a ""mommy"" magazine on how to organize your life with a toddler and a career. I love the way the bag looks and the functionality is wonderful. What I am dissapointed in is the quality of the product....after about a month of usage the stitching unraveled around the zipper...I noticed it was very loose when I got it but did not think anything of it...So like I stated I am a bit disappointed in the quality..."
5,welder/hobbyist,"If you work on, weld, silver solder or generally mess with antique weaponry (and metal antiques in general) this book is a boon, a guide, a resource. It is pitched to the layman, highly readable and well researched. I use it as a reference more or less constantly when selecting tools, metals, temperatures etc."
5,EXCELLENT!,The product arrived in perfect condition and just when I thought it would! Couldn't be any happier with the service and the product! Got a great deal too!!!
5,Classic and elegant,"I might prefer the more square coffee cup, but other than that, this set is timeless"
5,beautiful quality rug,"This rug is very true to color in the illustration. It has dense fiber and is good quality. The size I ordered was too small for my space, so I returned it. However I would recommend the rug. It is a great rug for the money."
4,Bostitch F21PL nailer,"I bought this nailer specifically to use the Hurriquake nails on earthquake reinforcement projects. Its been a pleasure to use and have had only a couple of misfeed nails. The plastic debris from the nail clips does make a mess - wearing good eye protection is a must. It is surprisingly light for it's size, and has excellent power."
4,Great framing nailer for a great price,"I bought this gun to frame a 24x30 barn. It worked like a charm until I used it while it rained. It started jamming up with both sheeting nails and framing nails. The driving pin even managed to get a nail lodged in the magazine that was only removable once the magazine was removed. Once cleared and oiled up good, it worked great just like before! Nails are relatively easy to find for it (not as easy as contractor-grade wire welds). Great gun for a great price! And light weight, too!"
3,Nice Nailer Once it Works,"I received this nailer brand new, but it was broken right out of the box. I had to take it to a Bostitch service center to be fixed, which then took almost two weeks. It would have been easier to return and buy another one. The problem with the nailer was extremely obvious and should have been caught at the factory. Bostitch should have better quality control. Once repaired, the nailer works fine."
5,Exceded My Expectations,"I own 7 other nail guns, and the Bostich F21PL was a great addition to my collection. The Gun's light weight made it easy to use over a long day, and because it is easy to control, I was able to get into tight angles. The rubber foot and the rafter hook were greatly appreciated. The fact that it is multi-purpose makes this an extra value that you don't usually find in today's world of corporate greed.John"
2,Leaked out of the box,"Sadly this one leaked right out of the box. The handle is an air reservoir and air was leaking out of one of the nuts at the base of the it. I can only give it another star because the of the depth adjustment. It was easy to use, though I don't know what the long term life of it will be. There's basically a row of teeth that lock into place to hold the proper depth setting. I would imagine that after a while those teeth would wear down and it would start jamming up.Also to note, there's a plastic cover on the front of the nailer (not shown in the picture) that covers the exposed spring. It's only fastened on one side of the housing which I could see getting caught on something and being ripped off, but if you're careful it'd be fine.It did seem to have plenty of power, even with a leak. Was splitting scrap 6"" long 2x4s and drove nails fairly well even when the depth adjustment wasn't all the way dialed in."
2,"metal connector nails unavailable in 2 1/2""","I was going to buy this for a deck job. The Bostitch joist hangar nails are horribly overpriced on Amazon and not available locally. My local guy told me Bostitch is no longer supplying the 2 1/2 metal connector nails. He just shrugged when I asked about the future availability of the 1 1/2 inch metal connector nails. He said they might just be selling out what they had and there would be no more. However, that was just speculation, as Bostitch ain't talkin' .....Will search more first.Either that or buy a brand with reasonable nail prices. I will have to do a nail count to see if the saving on nails will pay for buying a Senco Joistmaster."
4,Framing Nailer Review,This pneumatic nailer worked very well and was easy to use. I did find that the 21 degree nails required are not as common as other nails at the big box hardware stores.
4,not a bad tool,"I received this F21PL at work (I am not in construction), whereupon I opened it immediately. I came to find out Stanley had shipped 2 framing nosepieces for the nailer, and forgot to send a metal fastener nosepiece. Getting on the phone I was met with a great response which netted me the correct piece in the mail 3 days later. I was impressed by their responsiveness. Having tried out only framing nails, I have found the same shower of sparks from the tip of the nailer as others have reported. Otherwise it seems to work quite well, although I wish the framing tip had a more agressive face to it to aid in toenailing. Overall I would give it 4.5/5 stars."
3,Plastic hook broke first day,"Three hours on the job and the plastic hook breaks off. There is a reason most use metal hooks instead of plastic. Every shot produces a spark, some have said this dissipates The plastic collated nails produce a lot of ""popcorn"" after use. at least the plastic stays together when wet which is better then paper when its wet.The gun will frequently mis-fire. We have switched to the smart trigger but this hasn't changed the mis-fire rate. I think I will go back to Hitachi"
2,Positive Tip Problems,"When I purchased it new for about 350.00 , thie positive placement tip broke right away. They sent out a couple more but the metal is too soft and ran out of them. Customer service will no longer take my calls , so I use it as an extra framing nailer(without the tip piece). Now when you hook it up to the air hose it fires a shot every time. I must make sure there is nothing in the clip before connecting the air. My employees are aware of this , and mostly stay clear of the gun. I await the day that it actually goes ""full auto"" , then customer service might return my calls. William Lee , Willis Contractors , San Diego."
1,Poetry for Old Ladies and Reactionaries,"Ugh. Just when you thought poetry about sabbaticals in Greece and Rome had been squashed by Bly and others in the sixties, it's back. This is poetry that is merely descriptive, boring, and unimaginative--like much of the poetry today. Bakken's work will please those who believe poetry should behave well in the drawing room and at the faculty wives' tea club."
4,"Excellent coverage, friendly lingo","For a textbook, this is written in a reader-friendly style. You can almost see the author at the blackboard explaining the concepts AND math in plain English. And yet, very little handwaving at all. On the other hand, this may also present special readability challenges: you may find yourself constantly flipping between text and tables to follow the discussion.From a pedagogical point-of-view, some of the developments might have been more intuitively presented. For example, the chapter on option-pricing theory should mention the expected-value interpretation. Over all, however, this text does very well on this score.I particularly liked the survey of empirical studies at the end of each major concept, that discusses the imperfections that other researchers have looked into, and their findings.This is one of the core reference texts I keep on my desk."
3,Review of Modern Portfolio Theory,Required text for a portfolio management class I am taking. This book does not seem particularly visually engaging - absolutely no color at all in the book. Dry subject matter and a text to match.
5,A combo for everyone,I had read the reviews on this item and found them mixed on the simplicity (or difficulty)in usin it.I have found that the instructions are clear and simple.The one touch dubbing is a treat. You wwould like this item.
4,No comment,"I bought this thing thinking it would be something special. It's pretty cool. It fits the computer nicely, doesn't scratch etc. However it's made pretty cheaply and made in China. The stitch on the inside doesn't appear to be sown all that well. However, for $30 it does a great job of giving my 17' Mac Book pro a nice smooth small and durable case."
4,Good pricing.,"I've been adding to my horror collection and i got this for the 2nd one, the price i got it for was worth it for the 2nd one, the third one wasnt feeling too much and i tried watching the 4th but i'd say the 1st 2 are the best. good price with fast shipping, cant beat that, thanks."
5,something worth listening to,I just like it. This music makes me feel good. Every song on this c-d has a great groove. I highly recommend this cd because of it's variety. It has all styles wrapped in one.
5,Has some funky good grooves,I saw Dian in person and what a show. This c-d has the same quality as her live performance. Dian has so many different styles. I listen to this c-d every day. I truly enjoy every song on it.
5,Wonderful Shampoo!,"We live on a lake in the woods and own 8 dogs, 5 of which are labs and love to swim. Because of that they are always needing baths. Lambert Kay Fresh n Clean Shampoo is the only pet shampoo we have used for the past 10 years. It leaves your pet extremely shiney and soft not to mention the great fragrance that stays on the pet for 2 weeks even after they've been swimming. Our dogs don't have fleas, but we still use the Fresh n Clean Flea and Tick Shampoo as a preventative. I don't ever plan on switching! Try it, you won't regret it."
3,A decent all purpose EDC,"I purchased this for my son, he's 15. This is intended to be an EDC for utility purposes. The liner lock will be sufficient for the intended purpose. If you are looking at this knife as a possible hunting knife, keep looking. The liner lock is not likely to hold up to regular field duty and will be a bear to keep clean/functional."
1,What a piece of trash!,"Although described as a hardcover, I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and there was NOTHING in it that was not in the Dragonolgy text. It was also NOT a hardback, but a little pamphlet in a box with a cheap bit of plastic token. Definetly not of the quality of Dragonolgy."
2,Looks like leftovers that they couldn't fit into the book,"I had quite high hopes for this little kit given the phenomenal Dragonology. However, it is genuinely disappointing. The kit includes a nice plastic talisman with crystal, a package of dragon powder, a dragon rune decoder and a small 2 inch x 2 inch book of spells. For the suggested retail of $8.99, it's pretty overpriced, and the items are small enough that one wonders why they weren't incorporated into the Dragonology books in the first place. Surely with three books, filled with secret compartments, one could have found space for these?"
3,Worth the money? Probably not...,"My son likes it, but I'm not sure I would have wasted the money to purchase this had I known just what it was..."
5,a must have for dragon enthusiasts,I received a little box with dragon stuff inside it. My 24 year old daughter saw what was inside and asked me for it. I must get another. This little box with a few goodies inside is a must if you collect anything dragons. I recommend it.
2,Book is a joke,"2 points:1. The author loves Airstreams so much, he buys a Silver Streak.2. The photographer has a 13 panel endcap Airstream (page 58). It's pretty well known these were phased out in the 50's (1958 I believe). The author labels it as a ""1975 Flying Cloud"".I got the feeling Mr. Littlefield was laughing all the way to the bank."
3,nice pics. not so nice binding,"really great for airstream lovers. beautiful pictures and ideas for airstream updating and decorating. the binding, however, could not withstand the weight of the pages and loosened up pretty quickly."
4,Interior Decorating at Its Best,"Not only does this book give nice, colorful pictures of different theme decorated Airstreams, the author adds a nice touch of his own memories with Airstreams and a brief history of this particular type of RV.The only reason I didn't give this book a full 5 stars is that while the pics in there are nice I didn't feel there were enough with each RV. 1 or 2 pics doesn't really do a designer justice in his/her creation of the RV interior."
5,Seattle road trip fun,We took this on a road trip to Seattle in our VW van and everyone in the van had a blast looking at the photos and dreaming about owning (and developing creative uses for) an Airstream one day. Great fun.
4,good content- horrible binding,"My husband read the reviews before I ordered him this book, so we knew the binding would wear out and start coming apart at some point....we just didn't think it would happen THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKED AT THE BOOK!!! Literally, while he was CAREFULLY looking through the book for the first time the day he received it, the binding came apart. The content of the book is great. Just what we expected, but we were disappointed that we didn't at least get to enjoy the book a few times before it came apart. I went ahead and rated this 4 stars for content and because we were dumb enough to read the reviews and buy it anyway."
5,Airstream Living,A great book that captures the fun of Airstream-ing. I also gave one to a friend and now she wants to buy an Airstream!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE MEASURE,"This tape measure is horrible. The reason is the scale is extremely hard to use. Most tape measures have scales which indicate feet and inches. This tape measure doesn't measure off feet but actually measures off 16 inch intervals! There is a scale to mark off feet but its labelled but in almost impossibly small to read text. Then if you want to know how many inches it extends beyond that foot mark, you literally have to count the inches past the small text which is hard to read to begin with. Its almost like the makers wanted to make this measure as hard to use as possible. Then they put another useless scale in red which marks of every two inches (at 36 inches this other scale marks of 18). Even if it might be helpful to have a scale which marks off every two inches, its like they think your too stupid to divide by 2. I repeat, do not get this tape measure. I can't believe they can mess up something so simple to make!!"
5,Accuracy,We switched to this tape as the standard for our production line strictly because of the consistancy and accuracy between tapes.
3,No weight loss noted.,"I've got a hefty cat. At 14 lbs, she's definitely on the big-boned side of things. For about a year and a half we had her on this weight-control stuff, feeding her about a 1/2 cup a day as recommended on the packaging. But in that time, we hadn't seen any significant weight-loss.About 6 months ago, we switched to the CostCo-brand stuff, and got lazy about measuring out her food and have just refilled her bowl when empty. Now, I suppose it's possible that the CostCo food doesn't taste very good, and that's why she eats less of it, but it seems to serve the same purpose, and it's not like she complains about it. After all is said and done, she's still 14 lbs.I don't want to say it doesn't work, because maybe it will for your cat, but it didn't for mine so I wouldn't expect any miracles here. Still, it did serve its primary function (the cat ate it) despite not living up to its secondary function (the cat is still fat) so, 3 stars."
2,Noticed no difference.,"We have a 21 pound cat, and for 3 solid months we kept him on a strict diet. The amount they recommended for his size we actually REDUCED a bit and measured it out in a measuring cup daily. He didn't even lose an ounce."
5,Great new recording of Billy Budd,"This Chandos set is a great one and is of superlative quality. The Britten recording contains Michael Langdon's unforgettable Clag- gart. Simon Keenlyside gives a magnificent interpretation as Billy Budd, amazing in which he combined innocence, goodness and virility, never for a moment suggesting soppiness, with the final ballad sung most affectingly. Richard Hickox realizes all the opera's drama in excellent playing. Even so, the towering single performance of Philip Langridge as Captain Vere, singing in controlled emotion and sheer vocal magic. His enemy in the opera is sung with black malevolence by John Tomlinson, sometimes too melodramatic, but there are moments of introspection which chill the listener's blood. As for the supporting roles, they are sung by some of best male voices in British opera, led by Alan Opie, Matthew Best and Alan Ewing as the three officers, vividly and meaningfully sung and so I could go on. A great performance!"
4,Very Good Printer,"Excellent print quality and very good print speed. However, the PCL 3 driver that comes standard with the printer is slow and error prone. We added the PCL 5 driver card and 32 MB of memory to get good performance out of the machine. We also added the Post Script card - but unless you absolutely have to have Post Script don't bother as it is also slow. If the machine had come with the PCL 5 card and more memory it would have been 5-stars."
1,throw away,After trying everything we could and spending an additional 162 dollars for ink we will throw this new machine away. I would give it to someone but I think it would be such a disservice that I would lose friends instead of helping. Hewlett Packard used to make good printers. This is the third and final junk printer and the worst even Hewlett Packard has perpetrated on us yet.We have a new policy at our company. If it says Hewlett Packard the answer is no.
3,toys for guys,"I like Scott Campbell's comics: those nice girls Indiana Jones look alike! In the mainstream of Lara Croft, Indiana Jones and other 'what if' stories where also the 'bad guys' of the 3rd, 4th or 5th Reich are still alive and in 'good' shape, the 'Danger Girls' have a place thanks the very good drawings. Natalia is, for me, the sexiest of the trio, sadly is a turncoat character and it had no place amongst the 'good girls' which were done also in 1/6 scale figures, so the only 3D figure is this one: it is well done but a bit 'small' as I like large scale figures."
2,Ok read; not a whole lot of helpful info.,"This book is an okay read---not a lot of helpful info---mostly stuff you probably already know about the biz. I would not trust the mailing lists for agents, agencies---double-check the info on the internet or other resources, especially to see if they accept unsolicited submissions. Geared toward acting, not that much regarding modeling/print ads."
5,Strut mount only!,Dont go by the picture. it only comes with the strut mount. Sill it was a good price and what I needed!
5,La Roche-Posay Vit. C Antiwrinkle Cream,"Usually get this cream from my doctor, but found it cheaper on Amazon and ordered enough to have no shipping charges. Now I don't even have to go to my doctor's office to buy this. I use this great cream religiously, not only at bedtime but under makeup. Love the consistency and the fact that it's not greasy. I would recommend this to everyone."
5,Excellent product,"It was introduced to me by my PCP 3 years ago. She is a true believer of vitamine C which in this formula will penetrate the dermis. I have become a true believer myself after being on it for 3 years. My skin looks smoother and younger for my age, and myself (and people!) notice that. The only shortcoming is the price, especially from the retailers. But since I found much friendly price from Amazon.com, I have taken advantage of it. I often order 5-10 at a time just so I will not run out even for a single day/night.Ladies, it time to invest on yourself!"
5,Best ever!,"I have been using this cream for a couple of years now. It is the best! no Sticky non grease, it is just ideal!! I just love it, too bad is so expensive otherwise I will use it 3 times a day!"
1,zero effect,"It was an absolute waste of money. First, it irritated my skin and made it even drier. I thought it was an initial reaction and kept using it for for a full month. The same thing. My skin gets dry and no difference whatsoever..."
1,Shipped wrong product from Greece.,Active C for eyes is not the same as Active C anti wrinkle dermatological treatment.Not happy at all. Really long wait to end up with wrong product.
3,Sexually Suggestive!,This is one of my favorite books. It is very sexual and in good taste. There is much to be learned about the human desires and how to stir them up! I have read this book 3 times and will definately read it again!
2,"OK book, but not recommended","""Harem Girl"" was an easy read and some of the details of the harem life were interesting (ie- how the women come to desire their ""master"" and dress/act/pose in ways to attract his attention; the piercing ritual; the punishments and rules of the harem), however the story of how the author came to be in the Harem was so contrived and unrealistic, as was the master's sudden desire to set all his slaves free towards the middle of the book- such a complete role reversal and ideological shift simply could not take place in a matter of a few weeks. Additionally, the author tried way too hard to make the book overtly sexual and it just didn't work.If you have an interest in what Harem life may have been like I would recommend Debbie Taylor's ""The Fourth Queen"" which is much less contrived and much more realistic."
1,This is the path to stupidity ...................,"This is what you get when a retired management professor writes a book about something he doesn't have the faintest understanding of - in this case creativity. He reads lots of books looking to give himself a few ideas, and then uses what he likes most, with a liberal sprinkling of author quotes.The sheer intellectual depravity of this book can be illustrated by seeing who he references most.1. Thomas Edison2. Albert Einstein3. (drum roll please!) Evan Esar tied with Alex OsbornWhat I'd really like to read would be his explanation of how a Ph.D professor emeritus could write this sentence in chapter 4, ""You now have a criteria for buying or building a house that will accommodate both your needs"". And yes, it is a double error, as he means the needs of two people."
5,Sarazen writes from 1920 to 1949 of the great players in that time period,Great book written by one on the all time greats. A career that lasted as long as any professional. Nice insite on the players from 1920 to 1949 when Gene wrote the book.
2,Usually a good snack bar,"I've had this brand before, from a health food store, and they're usually crisp and in separate layers. These from Amazon gave me the impression that they had been heated then they congealed together when cooled."
5,An Excellent Value,"The five-star rating for this set is at least in part because it is a splendid bargain. Not every performance is the ultimate: Paul Crossley's piano playing is very fine but it doesn't banish the memory of Firkusny or Schiff. And there are better recordings of the quartets than the Gabrieli's. But these are very fine recordings overall. This set, combined with Decca's omnibus opera collection (with Mackerras et al.), provides a broad survey of this important and fascinating composer at a bargain price."
4,The birth of the Infantry Fighting Vehicle,"I own a BMP IFV, so I know a thing or two about them and this book presented a nice array of informative information. It covered the different variants in some detail and the only thing I would change would be to add a few more photos of these vehicles in use by the Russian military, but I guess thats hard to do.A very well presented book.Charles TANKBOY Knight"
2,"S. Zaloga is not the man to turn to, for an unbiased revew.","This book follows in the footsteps of other Zaloga titles, like ""T-72"", ""Tank war-Central front"", or just about anything else he has written. Paranoia of Russian weapons has seemed to be hunting Steven, as BMP is a clear reflection of that. The whole book is quite tilted in all aspects, from beginning to the end, he boasts of Western tank designs at the expense of Russian equipment. Illustrations are sharp, however no special variants are displayed in the drawings, just the standard BMP-1, 2, 3's). In other worlds, you want to have good illustrations of this vehicle for modeling purposes, then perhaps the books is what you need( even though frontal and rear color-plate drawings are scarce, 9 of 12 drawings are straight side-views ), however, if you want this book for educational purposes, my recommendation would be to look for a less biased source to get a fair evaluation. -david"
5,The Classic,"I first played Tie Fighter back when you had to install it on DOS with multiple floppy disks. This game is very special, though I did not not know it at the time. The key to the Tie Fighter experience was in the physics model. If you watch the movies, you are aware that despite the fact that the planes are in outer space, they bank, roll, and yaw as if there was an atmosphere because that is just how we are used to understanding things like dog fights. The way that the fighters behave int this game is just...RIGHT. This makes the game highly playable. Without any real landmarks, no up or down or horizon it is tricky to make a fighter feel fast and they hit a sweet spot with this game. The story is interesting and they even let you joint a secret society when you get to be pretty good. Sadly, my dad's old computer could not handle the sound of the game so despite having played it and beat it maybe a dozen times, I have never heard it. Still, a work of art."
4,W.C. Fields Straight Up -Dvd,It was an interesting look into his real life. As excellent and enjoyable as his movies are you really have to be into Fields to watch this dvd.It was enjoyable in parts but dragged a bit.
2,Good Swing bad Follow Through,"This game has hope of being somthing wonderful in the online gamming market. But currently bugs, and lack of customer service make this game very hard to like."
5,It has been a long time coming,"If you have played D&D for the last 30 years or if you like action and adventure, this is the game for you. Based in Wizards of the Coast world of Eberon you get to create and play the character of your choice. Fun online play. Plenty of quests to complete and many more being added in the future. DDO is an excellent mmorpg."
2,really needs work,The game really needs work. come check it out in 2007 if it is still around. It looks like they are working hard on it. I paid for a year so I'm just hanging out waiting for it to get better. Check it out later.
3,"A good game, but...","It just lacked a certain something. I liked the integrated voice chat with party members, the graphics and music were good. I liked the click-to-swing combat, though in conditions of high net lag, it was awful (same as any internet game really). I can't think of anything I dislike about the game, but for some reason I lost interest in it fairly quickly, and I haven't even gotten halfway to the level cap. It's probably more me than the game. Anyway, definitely worth it to try the 7 day free trial and decide for yourself."
2,I am sorry I bought this,"This is the first on-line game I have bought. I purchased it for my 11 year old son. It took over 12 hours to download 5.5 gigabytes of code, and with it, deeply infected my 2-month old high-end Dell computer system with a worm. I did not understand that it would entail a $15/month service fee or more. We were never able to get it up and running. I can't truly rate the game, because it never worked. I guess I had no idea what I was buying."
2,I really wanted to like this game,"I had high hopes for this games, but find myself very disappointed. While Turbine has created a beautful game that accurately implements the D&D; ruleset, they forgot to make it fun.My main complaints:- Little solo playability. You have to have a group to undertake almost any dungeon.- Level progression is slow and boring.- Small world.- Combat is mostly a click-fest without a lot of thought or strategy.- No regeneration during a dungeon. (I know this is consistent with the D&D; rules, but it kills solo play.)- Rogues do not play well. I like their ability to disable things and limited stealth, but their unique abilities do not translate well into the combat system that is implemented.Some postitives:- The game is beautiful.- Hey, its really D&D;!- Great back story."
2,DDO is different but not too much fun,"A big WOW fan like everyone else on the planet, I find myself bored with the game. So a few friends and I decided to try DDO. Its difficult to interact with other players, no auction house, way too many stats to keep track of for weapons and armor.Its different, but not nearly as friendly looking and feeling as wow. I am hoping the Lord Of the Rings MMO will be better, but both are by Turbine I beleive, so not keep high hopes.By the way: The DDO commercials look way cool. The game itself looks and feels nothing like fun."
2,Severely disappointing,"If you want an MMORPG this is *NOT* the game you want; you should look to World of Warcraft (still). Its only 'massive' when you are waiting around, other times its pure instance based.If you want a literal interpretation and very good implementation of the D&D; rules in a game this *NOT* the game you want; you should try NeverWinter Nights or the forth coming NWN2. This game totally screwed up the rules, throwing in random things like '+5 to all skills' and a Mechanoid race.The requirements for this game imply that it should be graphically very advanced. Guess again, its kinda far behind the current crop of games.Overall this title could have had *HUGE* potential, but it really failed. Its a mediocre at best game with an 'offical' license attached to the box."
1,This is the worst save your money,Hello all just a note to tell people to stay away from turbine this game is bad buggy and very little content and they want 14.99 a month to keep playing and playing the same dungeons over and over. I played the beta and thought there would be a lot more content in the game when it realeased there was not and the bigger dungeons that are in the game have been closed half the time since the game was released because of bugs. Also I tried to sell the game on ebay to help recoupe some of my money and turbine complained to ebay and had my game listing removed. Well I hope it was worth it turbine I will never by any software from you or atari again. To many companies release games that are not done and stick us with them with no recorse/return policy I will wait next time and not listen to the hype.
1,The box says Dungeons & Dragons but its not...,"I think the only reason this game is even selling is because of the Dungeons & Dragons name, give it another name alltogether and it wouldn't have half the following nor half the fans cheering it on.I""m wondering if the same people who support this game would do so if it had a different name altogether, maybe something like Adventures Quest"
1,No Support for Solo Players,"The graphics and gameplay are ok but the major problem with this game is that it has no support for solo questing. You need to be a part of a group to complete any of the quests. And, because you don't get experience until you complete a quest, it is near impossible for a solo player to progress."
3,A sure fire dissappointment,"For the RP PnP game that started it all perhaps my expectations were too high.Technical glitches, rubberbanding, watching monsters that should be walking, slide up to you without moving, wasting play time at the Inn for regen, instanced only adventuring...it's all just very......dissappointing."
1,Dungeons and Dragons Online: Stormreach,"A complete and total disappointment. The folks giving this game more than one star must be in the employ of Trubine for there simply is no justification for this game making past Beta. The vaunted graphis were weak, gamplay poor, story line--what story line! I have played MMOs rangeing from Ultima Online to Warcraft and I must say this is one of the worst games I have had the displeasure of purchasing. Save your money and time, dont waste either on this game."
2,I really really wanted to like this one,"I sounded like the perfect blend of the Challange of an RPG and the Online Community of a Massive Roleplayer. Unfortunatly from a Roleplayers point of view it's just another massive multiplayer repeating the same quests over and over, grinding, farming, ect. ect. The only real differance is it does have a nice D&D ""Feel"" about it with all the newly trademarked monsters and such but in reality it's not close to an RPG."
5,The Memphis Museum will never seem the same.,"Mr. Spicer uses actual locations to set his scenes. This one is primarily in the Memphis Museum and Memphis itself. Once you read this book, a visit to either will not be the same. Loved the book. Wish he would write more and I don't particularly like scary stories. You will not put this one down!"
5,Raw and Relentless,"If your not on the edge of your seat, your leaning back laughing or crying. This guy writes straight forward with no stop signs!"
3,Too far out for me - based on real experience?,"An interesting story from a wild imagination, but from actual experience? I don't think so. If you don't take it seriously it is an enoyoable visit to the world of hocus-pocus and horror."
4,Good item,"I bought these to hang up posters in my room without putting holes in the walls. I use 8 for each averaged sized posters. They have all been sticking really well to the walls so far. Out of 13 posters in my room, only 1 corner of 1 poster came up twice in 1 week. But I haven't had a problem since I added 1 more square to that side. You get a lot for the price too."
3,Did not work for me,"Only 3-stars from me as this tape did not do the job that I bought it for. I was only trying to mount an ornamental piece to the wall since due to its design it did not have a ""nail"" hanging receptacle. It piece was less than 1lb in weight and in spite of me appyling sufficient tape, it just would never hold.I think I got an 'expired' tape as it wasn't even sticky to touch with bare fingers."
4,cats flea and tick collar,i thought this collar was pretty good my cat seemed to keep it on and it didnt bother him it mentions it protects for 7 months which is good and its been two months now and you can still smell the scent on the collar i think its exceptionally good if you can still smell the ingredient whats in the collar even though i have still seen the odd flea on the cat so i dont think its actually killed the fleas as yet
5,The Goldberg legend continues,"This recording feels more like an exploration than a recital. That is a good thing; just another accurate performance of the Goldberg Variations is really not a contribution. This interpretation is interesting rather than idiosyncratic. I looked for similarities with Nikolayeva's recordings, and found some; but this is Propper's own property. He plays so well, one regrets that he takes repeats only occasionally, rather than invariably. With study, perhaps one could discern the meaning of his choices for elimating repeats, but in the meantime, it is almost necessary to listen to the recording twice in a row to feel replete with the beauty this monumental music always offers. Adding this to an already generous collection of BWV 988 is fully justified."
1,YUK!!!!,"If there were a lower rating than 1 star, this ""New Great Taste"" for Altoids Spearmints would deserve it. They are horrible; having no relation to a real spearmint flavor at all. Still green, but that's about all you can say. What a disappointment!"
1,Experi-mint in Terror,"I recently restocked my supply to discover a banner on the box announcing a change in flavor. Bleagh! The once addictive spearmint Altoids taste like a cut-rate wintergreen. Did I say bleagh? Bleagh!I'd hate to see nearly three decades of Altoids pleasure come to an end, but these are just plain lousy, now."
1,YOU HAVE RUINED THE SPEARMINT,"The traditional spearmint Altoids were excellent. The ""new"" flavor does not use oil of spearmint, having substituted artificial flavors instead. Bring back the oil of spearmint! Otherwise I will not be buying your mints again. I only liked the spearmint, and you have ruined it. Doubtless this is a money-inspired move. Shame on you."
5,Thank heavens for online shopping!,I absolutely love spearmint Altoids so I was distressed when they were no longer available at the only store in my area that carried them. Thank you for making this product available online!
2,Agree with the others -- New is NOT improved,"Loved the original. When Walgreens stopped carrying it, ordered from Amazon. Not their fault that flavor has been changed. I assume it was a marketing decision -- not enough volume to continue the formula. But what they decided to use instead is just a weird version of Wintergreen. Not quite as bad (i.e. Pepto-Bismol), but nothing like the addictive Spearmint it replaced. I could chew the old flavor like chewing jelly beans. Now, it's just a strong breath mint like the other Altoids. What a shame."
5,Why?,"Why is there an option to review these? All I can say is that I'm addicted to them. They're $3 a tin in the store. This is, or was, a good deal."
1,Why did they change a good thing???,"I've been buying the Spearmint Altoids for years, and loved the product. I just got a new tin of the ""New Great Taste!""--which is horrible! It tasted like menthol! Such a drag. I see now that there are more artificial ingredients in it. WHY??? I hope the company sees the feedback and reverts back to the original recipe. Or they'll lose a lot of customers. They've lost me for now."
1,Not anywhere near as good as other Altoids flavors,"Being a mint snob, I constantly am on the lookout for new varieties of coolness to what may already be a lifetime mint addiction. So disappointed that this new Spearmint Altoids is nowhere near Altoids Ginger or Cinnamon flavors. You pop it into your mouth, expecting either the distinctive spice of spearmint or the full-on blast of a regular mint, and on both counts it falls short. It neither belongs to the ""Curiously Strong"" or the ""naturally-flavored"" categories; it falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. All I get in my mouth is the refreshing feel of artificiality that quickly wears out in a few minutes. You'd be better off buying generic mints. Big taste fail."
1,FIX spearmint Altoids!,"The original spearmint Altoids flavor was my favorite flavor. The ""new and improved"" version is quite nasty in comparison. Please bring back the original spearmint flavor!"
1,"New ""improved"" flavor is AWFUL!!!","Spearmint Altoids were my favorite for years. When local stores quit stocking them, I began ordering them on-line. How disappointing it was to receive the new ""improved"" flavored Spearmint Altoids. They're AWFUL! I can't believe they would take their best product (in my opinion) and totally trash it. Please bring back the original Spearmint Altoids. PLEASE!!!"
1,go back to the old recipe,"I have to agree with Bob Trombone. I am so disappointed with the new Spearmint Altoids. Having searched for a couple of weeks for them, I was overjoyed to find them, only to be disappointed. Please go back to the old recipe!!!"
5,Excellent book to help you see what it must have been like!,"My father-in-law was a B-17 pilot in the 342nd Bomb Squadron, 97th Bomb Group, 15th Air Force during WWII. Like McGuire, he was stationed at Amendola, Italy. He doesn't talk much about his experiences but I've wanted to know more. BLOODY SKIES has given me such a deeper understanding of and respect for what my father-in-law and others serving has bommber crews over Germany experienced. Melvin McGuire does an excellent job of taking you back there to 1944 in WWII Italy and on the bombing missions that they flew. This is probably the best book about someone's personal experiences in WWII combat that I have ever read. It was hard to put the book down! Thank you Mr. McGuire for writing this book and for the insight that has brought a deeper respect for what you and those like you did for freedom."
2,Move along...,"I am an avid reader of Julia Alvarez. I collect first-editions of her novels and poetry collections.However, I had to force myself to finish this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Isabel but each time one of her chapters would end, I'd suffer through another one about Alma. I'd put down the book for days on end and have to make myself pick it up again.I'd love to see Alvarez try again and write a story about the Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition with nothing else to distract from it.If you're interested in Julia Alvarez, try ""In the Time of Butterflies"" or ""Garcia Girls"" instead. Skip this one."
3,A Bit of a Disconnect,"I too scooped up this book eagerly pleased Alvarez had a new release.The stories both captivated me. However only the story of Isabel kept my interest and rang true in a romaticized way. Alma's story, while a page turner (almost like a car wreck so painfully awful to read but you can't help but not turn away), started to a little too overly dramatic and silly. And when her story climaxed I was left thinking ""That was it?"" Some of the lose ends with Helen, Mickey and Hannah could have been tied up a bit better--or developed more to make the ends that they did have seem more statisfying.And after reading Alvarez's other books, I was a bit disheartened by what I perceived as a disconnect from the DR."
3,Fascinating and dull.,"Saving the world combines two stories. One is the fascinating story of a woman carrying live vaccines in the fragile bodies of small children across the world, with the dull boring and tiring story of a writer. Isabel and Alma are two women separated by hundreds of years. On one side the story of Isabel, moving from an Orphanage in Spain all the way to Latin America and Asia and back to Mexico mothering vaccine carrying children, captures the reader and transports us to the times where `the sun in Spanish territory never sat'. On the other side, Alma, a writer with a blockage is so boring that you might as well skip the pages to figure out what Isabel is endeavouring. The rating of the book should be sepparated into a 5 for Isabel's story and a 1 for Alma's."
3,Parallel story line does not work,"I read this book in Spanish, not knowing it had been translated from English. After reading the first couple of chapters, I realized I was reading a translation. The translation was ok, but not great.The parallel story line does not work well. Alma is self-centered and her concerns are trivial. Isabel's story, however, is gripping, particularly if you are a history buff. I wished that the author would have focused only on the story of the Royal Expedition. It would have made for a much more interesting novel. Every time I finished a chapter about Isabel,I felt disappointed that I would have to plow through a chapter about Alma before being able to continue Isabel's story."
1,Zzzzz,"The concept of bringing together smallpox and HIV in an historical crucible intrigued me, and I thought I would find the story about using young boys to perpetuate the smallpox vaccine scientifically interesting. The latter was true, but the more I got into this book, the more I actively disliked the main character, Alma. A growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book. The author, in my opinion, wasted my time on needless, and seemingly endless details that added nothing to the story for me but pages, time, and effort.Though the book apparently appeals to some, it was an experience in reading drudgery for me. Nuff said."
4,Parallels are engaging!,"This book kept my attention by cleverly switching between the lives of two women in different centuries, but with analogous stories. I particularly liked the story of Isabel (perhaps because historical fiction is my favorite genre)...It was eye-opening."
2,Tedius and Wordy -- What Was I Thinking,"This novel goes on and on and on. The protagonist is self-absorbed, the characters mostly sketched rather than developed. Alvarez offers one stereotype after another. There may be themes buried in all the blah blah, but I am finding them hard to detect. Alvarez has issues with the publishing industry. Who doesn't? This is one of the worst purchases I have made in a long time."
3,Alma,"If only this book had skipped the Alma chapters, I would have given it an A+. The writing becomes so disparate as Alvarez switches between the modern world (Alma) and the historical world of Isabel.The chapters about Alma have potential, but are choppy and it is hard to become immersed in them. On the other hand, the Isabel chapters are beautifully written and you want them to go on and on.It's my first Alvarez book, and I'm going to try one or two of the others that the other reviewers suggest.This is a good book for a plane ride. : )"
4,Enjoyable and informative!,"I had never thought about it before - that before refrigeration, there were many challenges for very important things like vaccines! How to get a vaccine from one country to the next? Fascinating - thank goodness for creative minds and those willing to toss about on a boat at sea, risking lives.I most enjoyed the chapters about Isabel and the boys. An enjoyable read all around."
5,Wonderfully Entertaining,"I loved this book. I thought the alternating chapters between the centuries worked well. I found both stories equally riveting.I would say however, that I did not feel that the stories were really connected. Before I read the book, the reviews seemed to indicate that both women were involved in ridding the world of disease, one of small pox and the other of AIDS. I would classify it more as a modern writer who becomes fascinated with a story. A story that she was researching while going through what could be described as a midlife crisis. The only similiarity that I could see was that both women had ""children"" though neither had given birth.Overall, the fact that the stories didn't seem connected didn't have a negative impact on the fact that both stories were well written and compelling."
5,Works as advertised,"This adapter takes a mono (one ring connector)audio signal and splits it into a stereo (two ring connector)so that you don't have to play the push it in a little, pull it out a little game to hit one of the rings justright on your stereo connector.It does not create a stereo signal from a mono signal, but plays the same mono signal on both rings of the connector, and out to your two speakers. If you did not use this, you would only hear noise from one speaker at a time, and as you pushed and pulled the connector in and out of the mono female interface, the noise would go from one speaker to the other. Got it!IT WORKS GREAT FOR ITS APPLICATION"
2,Wrong adapter.,"The pictured adapter looks like and the ad describes it as a stereo female and mono male. I received the reverse, i.e., a stereo male and mono female!! I misplaced the paperwork and could not contact the vendor so they could replace the item with the correct adapter. How can this matter be taken care of??"
2,A fair historical recounting heavily diluted by personal memoirs,"Mr. Leschak writes quite well, I think. But, as was stated in other reviews, unless you have a real interest in wildfire fighting from a ""line boss"" point of view, this effort is less about Peshtigo and firefighting than it is about Mr. Leschak's personal spiritual journey and his finding personal fulfillment leading a fire crew. He is quite unapologetic about his disavowal of all things religious, having become quite immersed in his own revelation as it relates to the natural world.What he does share about Peshtigo is enlightening and very absorbing. It is not as wanting as some might think, and the author ties in his own personal spiritual turmoil with the Catholic priest's encounter with the fury of nature (or is it an act of judgment?). Unfortunately, what one does read about the Peshtigo fire is about what you'd expect in a magazine story; just enough to whet your appetite for more."
2,Disappointed,"I was VERY disappointed with this book because it was recommended as a good account of the Peshtigo fire; yet, what the author actually had to say about this event could have fit into less than one chapter. I could not, however, justify giving it only one star as what he did say about the fire was interesting. This book would probably be read with great interest by those excited by helicopters and/or fighting wildfires as these are the real focuses of this book. Time after time, when I expected the author to really get into the Peshtigo fire, I was dismayed once again to find he once again goes into a long litany about himself which seems to be his true obsession. I got very tired of his self-praise and importance, his use of ""big words"" - as though to impress when plain language would have suited better, his over-emphasis on descriptive phrasing, and incomplete sentences! If you want to read about the Peshtigo fire, don't bother with this book."
3,Vid for Searching Skeptics,A good tool to use for the skeptics. The video answers many of the questions that one might have. For the most it is well done.
5,Lush Pianistic Brilliance,"Leopold Godowsky was one of music's most gifted minds. He had a Bachian sense of counterpoint married to a Chopinesque sense of the piano. It was, perhaps, inevitable that Godowsky would be drawn to Bach's music. This CD contains Godowsky's paraphrases (these are far more ambitious than simple transcriptions) of three of J.S. Bach's suites for solo cello. Godowsky tackles the d minor, C major, and c minor suites. The paraphrases show off both Mr. Grante's impeccable technique and musicianship, as well as his gorgeous tone. These sound almost like transcriptions for organ in places because of Mr. Grante's lush tone production. This, and its sister CD of the Bach/Godowsky violin sonatas are highly recommended. If you enjoy the Bach/Busoni Chaconne, then you will love these."
2,Mostly just perversion,"""Decapitator Asa"" is a sword tester and executioner for the shogun. This is the premise. It is an excuse to explore the tales of violence, sex, and perversion that have led criminals to the chopping block, so to speak. The illustration in uncolored pen and ink is mediocre. Not sure what the deal is with these strange period dramas set in the Edo period, like Hanzo the Razor, too. I'm always a sucker for sword and sandal epics, East or West, but skimmed this one just to see what the series is like. Not that enjoyable and don't care about the characters."
3,Not Great but OK,"I loved lone wolf and cub, as for samurai executioner it is not as good. I did enjoy the first story in the book where he becomes the executioner however. After I finished reading it there were still no real emotions that i had for Aseamon or in other words i don't care about the character like i cared for Ogami after reading LWandC 1. It seems that all Asaemon does is chop off heads..he doesn't go anywhere and doesn't seem to have any other life outside of his job as decapitator. There was a story in this book concerning a child rapist and there is a scene in which he is actually shown assualting a little girl. I thought that was a little much. Even after the resolution i was still a little disturbed that they drew that in there. This is darker than lone wolf and cub so far there are scenes of decapitaed bodies being carried arround and the whole rape and much more sex scenes that in Lone wolf.. It can kinda turn ya off. I hope the rest are better."
3,anime,The content is kind of hard to understand. Reading this one would think that the Tokugawa period was filled with people that needed to be in institution. If you like wierd content this is the book for you.
5,What a treat!,"Was just surfin' around looking for Tom Waits tunes & lo & behold here was the simply fabulous ""Fishing with John"" show on DVD. Loved the episodes muchly; missed them now for several years. Low key wit, lots of silence (sometimes, deliciously strained,) celebs out of their element, mostly; no scripts, fighting the weather in out of the way places. In my top-10 TV shows of all time. As soon as I finish up here, I'm ordering the DVD!"
1,Pure garbage,"It never ceases to amaze me how idiots can enjoy crappy film making like this, and rate it as excellent, filled with humor, etc., etc. Lurie is an idiot, who brings out the same in his guests. If that passes for humor today, then so be it. Lurie laughed all the way to the bank. I'm ever so glad that I previewed it on YouTube and did not pay for it. Unbelievable, pure garbage and a waste of time, spent with people who are full of themselves for no good reason."
1,What????,"I bought this for my dad's birthday. He is a fisherman. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie. I bought it based on several reviews I read. This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon. The ""5 Stars"" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy."
3,Rent it first,"It is a interesting DVD to watch once. If you love fishing and that's the main reason you bough this dvd, you will probably be disappointed. Rent it first befor buying it."
3,an odd comedy and mockumentary,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition.This is the first non movie released through the Criterion Collection. It is a short lived TV series, which is a satire of the saturday morning fishing shows which used to be popular.Im this show, experimental musician John Lurie goes fishing with movie stars. There are 3 half hour episodes and one two-part hour long episode.The special features are audio commentary by John Lurie and a music video of his band, the Lounge Lizards.This show is one of the oddest comedies I have ever seen and completly out of the mainstream. Fishermen and comedians will both like this show."
2,Pretty Good,I love New Orleans. This book is pretty good. However. It needs either more recipes and less pictures or vice versa. It's trying to do too much and kind of fails to do either.
2,Meh.,"I've read most of his books, and am a fan, but this one just didn't cut it for me.I guess, like others, my biggest beef was the Emma character. What little character development Mr. White did resulted in little more than a whiny bitch.Also, the high-tech stuff left me thinking that perhaps he is thinking about writing in the Sci-Fi genre. Meh.I understand that Mr. White will be ending this series of books with the next one after ""Line of Fire."" It will be interesting to see what he does next, because I really consider him to be a talented writer."
4,Another Involving One by Stephen White!,"I enjoy Stephen White to the point that he's made my list of authors whose books I buy the hardcover edition the second they come out. Wow, each book by this author is better than the last. I found this one to be the most suspenseful by far. The short time period of the novel makes its pace urgent and its plot tight. It even made me fond of Lauren Crowder, who I found to be a largely unsympathetic character previously. The subject matter was fairly original."
2,Disappointed,"I have read all of Stephen White's books. This was the only one that I really didn't like and struggled to get through. Lauren was just too pathetic, the plot twists were absurd and even Alan (my favorite character) was a bit hard to take. If you're a Stephen White fan you have to read it just to do so, but definitely check this one out of the local library rather than purchasing it. If you're not a White fan, don't bother with it."
4,Remote Control,"The turns and twists of the plot are very interesting considering you are dealing with a period of approximately only twenty four hours. I love thrillers, Grishom, Sanford, Patterson, etc. and I rank White right up there with them. I have MS as does Alan's wife and Stephen White either knows someone who has it or has done a great deal of research, becuase he is right on in his portrail of Lauren and her systoms and reactions to life in general. It is refreshing to read something that makes an MS patient a real person and an intregal part of a realistic story. I would highly recommend this to thriller fans and MS patients that would like to see a fellow sufferer portrayed in a positive way."
4,"Great book, made me read the whole series","I got a prerelease copy of this book, and read it in two nights. It was very suspenseful, and a very god read. After reading it, I went and found all of the other Stephen White books and read them.The only unfortunate thing is that he has only written five books. <g>But, they are very good. They remind me of my favorite series, the Dismas Hardy books of John Lescroart.Very good, highly recommended"
3,Not One of White's Best,"As usual, White does a good job of laying out a plot with many twists and turns and characters that are a little more than one-dimensional. And he's a good wordsmith. But this book fails, I contend, because the main characters around whom the book revolves, are not very likeable. I found myself really not caring what happened to them. And by now I've read enough White books to know that they are pretty formulaic. You know the dynamite comes in the first chapter. You know that Dr. Alan Gregory will be involved in some last-minute Ramboesque actions that save the day and end the book. You know that White will hang another one of his radical leftwing beliefs,like a burning tire, around the neck of the book's villains (in this case, the pro-life movement). All in all, White writes books that succeed as airplane reading, but rarely move beyond three-star status."
1,LET'S HOPE HE'S GOTTEN IT OUT OF HIS SYSTEM,"I suppose every author writes a clinker now and then. After reading and loving the previous four books, I was stunned at the outright dullness of this ""effort."" I never felt any real suspense, nor did I find myself wanting to find out who the ""bad guy"" was. I didn't even care when his identity was revealed. At no time did I feel that Lauren was in any real trouble or that Emma might actually come to harm. I am confident that this book was a glitch, and that future White volumes will return to his normal high standards. I bought this one, after having checked out his previous four. A waste of money, to say the least."
2,so so,"I won't go into detail because others have, but although this book was well-researched and had many plot twists and turns, it was still incredibly boring. It was my first Stephen White book and I am not sure if I will read more.My other issue was with Emma Spire - her character was not developed enough. It was not clear why the media would be so obsessed with her other than the murder of her father."
2,The strap does NOT come attached to the lens cap itself!!!,"The strap does NOT come attached to the lens cap itself, as it looks like it does in the photo. It is one of those separate stick-on things that don't work for more than a few days.The cap itself is alright, but they shouldn't show the strap as if it's attached to the lens."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This fits on my lens but the stap is just a string with no elasticity to it so it just hangs on the lens and falls off, it doesn't hold itself on and the string it too short to connect to my camera and fit over my 250 mm lens. I would not suggest this to anyone, spend a couple more dollars and get one with a elastic band on it."
1,cheap quality,I purchased 2 of these and one of them broke. Because they were so inexpensive it wasn't worth returning. Look for a better quality item.
2,Eh..,"Didn't do what I was hoping, but I'm no expert in the A/V game. I would recommend a more basic description for those without the tech vocab"
3,Mary had a rough night...,"...before recording this one. The album has classic Mary Wells standards, but these versions are prior to modern recording and editing, so the audio is a little rough. Also, the songs seem to be in development as they do not sound exactly as one might expect after hearing the classic songs Mary is known for. Worth it if you're a Mary Wells fan, but if you're just looking for one album to complete your collection of oldies, this is not the one."
2,All Time Greatest Hits Mary Wells,"Unable to play disc on all cd players. Will not play on my Auto or portable player, but does play on CD player on my Desk Top.Very disappointing since all of my Amazon items have been 5 stars, until this order.All-Time Greatest Hits"
5,What a fantastic book - everything you always wanted to know,"A friend of mine told me about this book and said I had to read it. I am not a science student, but I found the book in my school library and read it anyway. It's a great book and I'm sure glad my friend told me about it. Plants are truly interesting, perhaps more so than animals because plants are so different from everything we are taught about in high school biology. Niklas's book is also well written. He speaks directly to the reader, using simple words to describe really complicated biological issues. Everything I always wondered about is found in this book. I've recommended it to my friends. I think everybody ought to know about the 'green world' that surrounds us!"
5,House calls - the healing process from every point of view.,"Great book, it basicaly show you how can you help in the healing process whether you are a patient, doctor, family member or friend of the patient.Many tks to Doctor Patch Adams for this creation.If you are interested in a medicine more humanized, this is a must on your bookshelf."
5,Love this,I ordered this book to use excerpts in my lectures for nursing students! I truly hope that the students can make similar connections with their clients.
5,For everyone who has ever been sick or who knows sick people: everyone!!,"If you care about the sick and want to know how to be human and help them heal! For doctors, nurses and everyone else..."
1,Missing Pages,"While you said this book was in great shape, the entire first five chapters had been torn out.I believe you should credit me or send another one."
5,Great Visual Reinforcement for Special Needs Children,"My 4-year old son has Down syndrome and he loves animals! We had rented this video at Redbox and he watched it over and over and over. So, I purchased it (well, the whole set.)In a little over a month of watching this video, He can now identify EVERY letter in the alphabet!!! I even asked him today, ""what does P-I-G spell?"" and he said, ""pig!"" He can tell you me fox, pig, dog, cat, frog...if I spell them to him!!This is a great educational and ABC visual reinforcement DVD for children with special needs or any kid!!I highly recommend it!!!!!!"
2,"Disappointed they use the voices of a 'bratty child' screaming ""NO!""",It's too bad they ruined this dvd by using voice-overs of children that are saying no in the question-answer section. There is no need for this particular version of the word and if the child watching is into mimicking you may find yourself in trouble. I found this at Redbox in case you want to try before you buy.The rest of the DVD is wonderful though and otherwise would have received 5 stars. Very educational and catchy alphabet song too.
5,Halo the Bear,"The bear arrived in a very timely fashion. He is just beautiful. He will bring much joy to the right ""Child"" when the next group of bears is given out. You see ""Child"" has no boundary of age. It can be a small one in a village in Cambodia or an Orphanage, or a child that has cancer in a local hospital or even a senior citizen in a rest home. This is why we are collecting these bears. Hopefully soon we will be obtaining donations but until then we will continue to pray for the funds to purchase bears of all shapes an sizes to send where ever God leads us :D"
3,"""Who's that is outside?"" ""Anybody!""","I bought the first two installments of this three-part chick flick as a gift for my mother, who wanted it after a girlfriend recommended it. Mom is annoyed with the broken-English subtitles, which were obviously done by someone with a limited knowledge of English. For example, the translator consistently uses the pronoun ""anyone"" when he means ""no one"" and conversely uses ""nobody"" when he means ""anybody"". I watched the film with Mom so that I wouldn't have to try to return two DVD's that had been opened, while trying to convince someone that the subtitles are ungrammatical. With my help in translating broken English to standard idiomatic Englsih, Mom enjoyed the story, which would touch most mothers. I was unmoved by the premise of the story, but I enjoyed the lush scenery of the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, the unintentional humor of the subtitles, and the intentional physical humor in the character of an incompetent Austro-Hungarian policeman."
4,Good book. Drawings help refresh memories of course play,This is a good book. The text is fine although I would quarrel with the inclusion of the Belfrey. The stroke-savers drawings are very detailed and handsome. Perhaps better for someone who has already played the course to help relive old memories
5,My daughter loves this,I'm not an authority on rabbits. or purple. My daughter is a huge fan of both and she assures me that this rabbit is the bomb.
4,Required reading for MIS professionals,"This book is absolutely dead-nuts on, explaining in plain English, so even Dilbert's pointy-eared boss can understand, the facts and fictions and cost pressures of the typical outsourcing arrangement. As I feel when reading many of Scott Adam's cartoons, I kept wondering when these authors had worked for my company--how did they know was going on so accurately? Their clear explanations of figuring if an outsourcing makes any sense (MIS people are dense at financial concepts, I know I am), but their simple charts and NPV explanations helped me through the tough parts. Chapman and Andrade know their history, and they explain why we're all going to relive it. Read it before you have to relive it too. I'm ordering an additional copy for my boss. (He doesn't have pointy ears--yet, anyway!)"
5,Perfect Carseat Blanket,"This fits perfectly over my infant while she is in her carseat. People are always stopping to ask me where I got it, and it is the softest blanket I have ever felt (much softer than many of the other more well-known botique brands). I love this blanket so much that I have bought several other Baby Star blankets for my baby as well as for gifts. My only disappointment was that Baby Star stopped making the larger size blanket in this ""full bloom"" style (I would have loved to have a matching set), though they make many other equally cute styles."
5,Movie List,This is a 4 disc set that contains:Disc 1Son of Samson/Son of CleopatraDisc 2Hero of Rome/Invincible GladiatorDisc 3War Gods of Babylon & War GoddessDisc 4The Magic Voyage Of Sinbad / The Day The Earth Froze(Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 may recognize the last two as riffing classics.)The price of this collection alone makes this a fantastic deal!You may also like:Warriors 50 Movie Pack Collection
3,Choppy video,"This video however was too choppy, the voices did not match the words, appears to skip scenes or something like that. I understand it was filmed in 1965...but with new technology could use better editing or upgrading whatever the Hollywood lingo is called. Correction: Filmed in 1964. Somewhat interesting if you can follow it."
2,"Not the best on Optimization, but good on security","The Security section is in depth and gives good detail. Personally, I bought this book for the Performance Tuning chapter of the Optimization section and was very disappointed. It's very short and was written in bullet points. Try this, try that, etc. Few explanations of why. Seems to me like the authors really don't know the subject.I'd recommend the book Performance Tuning Microsoft Networks by Eric Wise instead, which I bought more recently if you are just looking for NT optimization info like I was. It gives more detailed explanations, is more up to date, and covers TCP/IP."
5,I've been looking for these...,"I am so glad I found these. I had been using them for more than 25 years, but in the last few years they stopped selling them at Macy's and I was never able to track them down. I have tried many other brands of ""expensive"" and ""cheap"" sheers for a substitute. There is none like this for me."
4,Pantyhose,"No one sells quality pantyhose, so I was quite happy to locate on line in my size and great colors"
2,Pinch skin,"These hose looked nice on, but they pinched the skin on my thighs like a thousand tiny fingernails whenever I bent over and then stood back up."
2,"I liked the color very much, but not much else.",I think if they didn't have a sandal foot the hose would be a lot better. Perhaps my feet are too small to fill the sandal foot part though it didn't appear that way but once i put my pumps on the sandal foot started to bulk up and it looked like sagging skin. The hose also sagged at the legs just didn't look flattering at all.
4,Fun for my 21 month old...,"My 21 month old daughter enjoys this toy. She usually just plays with the horses and the people without the stable. My only complaint is that the barn doors do fall off easily. No big deal though, I wouldn't not buy this toy because of it. Also, be prepared to cut about two dozen wires to remove all of the pieces but that goes for all of the toys they sell these days."
5,Start with this one,"For those who are interested in Anthroposophy, or wish to seek out knowledge of the higher worlds, this book is a great starting place. Supersensible knowledge can be practical and be used in service to humanity. This book is a classic for good reason, and is recommended to be one of the first of Steiner's works one should read. You may gain a new perspective and a new level of understanding."
1,not pleased,bought this for a cross draw. holster is a little bulky. the draw is stiff and catchy with no tension adjustment. going back the shoulder setup. would not recommend.
2,Slow duration time ruins it all!,"This is a good camera in terms of its functions--yes, but this camera's achielles heel is that it takes too long to actually take any pictures--they turn out blurry because it doesn't take the picture when you hit the button. It needs time to focus, or just to respond to your touch. It is even worse with flash, the camera takes too long to come back after taking a flash photo--so if you want a so-so camera that operates well, you can get this---or you can get that anywhere...it's all about what you need this camera for. I want to take pictures that I can rely on 100% to take when I hit the button---it's not with D-435..."
3,Not That Great,"At first I loved my camara, it took really good pictures for a very low price. But then I noticed that I was the only one who was able to take good pictures! If I gave the camara to someone to get my picture taken, it would ALWAYS come out blurry. Also, not a good camara for pictures where the object is at a distance, good for close ups only. I bought it less than a year ago and I'm already looking into getting a new one."
3,D435 Overview,"I liked the size and compact feel of the camera. The lack of Optical zoom reduces its' ability to take pictures a bit far away. I would prefer at least 3X Optical zoom. The size of the screen on the back where you view the image to be taken is too small. Otherwise it was an OK camera for its price. It definitely is a ""beginners"" camera. I needed one one step up! I will probably gift it to someone and buy a camera with the better features I mentioned."
4,Good utility camera,"I purchased this camera to replace my older-model lost Olympus Camedia Digital Camera. I give this one 4 stars because I seldom ""love"" any machine or tool (Except my Mac!). But I like this one just fine and I like it much more than my old 3.1 mp version. No need for a memory card, as this one has enough internal memory to take around 100 HQ pics. I just keep an extra couple of xd cards in my bag to use if the need ever arises. Controls are simple, well thought out and much improved over my lost model. Near as I can tell, this one has no optical zoom (digital zoom only). For my purposes that's enough. Good utilitarian camera for beginners or people like me who use it mostly to take family pics or surprising art I see in the natural or man-made world. BTW I easily found all the manuals online."
3,"Not the best of its class, anymore","I own this book and have read it. It was wonderful for its time, but if I were buying now I'd buy the recent Nag Hammadi Library in English. Mr. Layton's collection isn't as comprehensive and I found his format a little annoying, as well as the New Age cover! The book omits some material from the Nag Hammadi find that I found myself really missing after a while. That said, I've used this book for years and have benefited enormously from it."
5,"A whole lotta' ""Huh?""","This book is unique in that it is the first book that you need that you won't understand. I was directed to purchase this book by a professor who was a student of Layton. I wanted to better understand the gnostic traditions and this book works to explain the gnostic mind in mind-numbing detail. The western, Enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don't exist in the rubric of rationalism. They are mythology. The gnostic scriptures are more like reading Hesiod's Theogony or Ovid's Metamorphoses than the New Testament. If your goal is to truly understand gnosticism Layton is indespensible. However, if all you want is a general understanding of gnostics, avoid this book. It will only muddy the water. You have been warned."
3,Confusing and more confusing,I bought this book for a research project I'm doing for college. I thought this would be a great book considering that it had so much of the lost books in it. When I started trying to do my research using this book I couldn't understand it at all hardly. The format was confusing in that stuff was all over the place. I also couldn't tell at times when it was the translators words or the real words from the books. I also think that the translator omitted much of the words and changed things. I would not buy this book again. The only thing that was good about it was that it did have so many of the books in it.
3,A surprising book!,It is a pretty good book. It has parts you would never had guess it would happen. Her life is very exciting. Just read the book and see what happens!
2,"Vague, Verbose, Quasi-scientific","The explanations in this text are not carefully worded. If you're actually trying to learn concepts and understand the material in any deep fashion this text will confound you and leave you with a shallow overview with some ""tools"". They throw up some formulas and wave their hands around a lot. When it comes to precise explanations and scientific concepts, this book is lacking. It gives you the vocabulary necessary to recognize the topics and ideas, but not the depth of knowledge necessary to actually UNDERSTAND and assimilate the science on any deep level.Overall, it's a sloppy text that does a sloppy job of introducing this topic."
5,There are better things than skiing in the Poconos.,"Blend is without a doubt one of the best albums I've ever bought. The music and lyrics are riveting, they really pull you in and get your feet tapping to the beat. In short it's a feel good, have fun album. Way to go Jim! When's the live album coming?"
1,With pleasure.,It is always amusing to come across a work that favors form over content. But perhaps scholarly books are not really designed to be read for this kind of entertainment - I have the feeling that someone is missing the point here.
1,Fear-Mongering and Inaccuracy are the real agenda here,"I was unfortunate enough to come across this book at a local used book store and since it was dirt cheap, I decided to read it because I was curious. What I found was absolute drivel. Its anti-gay rhetoric is designed to reinforce negative attitudes toward homosexuals, which it accomplishes vie generalizing, stereotyping, and the presentation of purely inaccurate information. Those who are already militantly anti-gay will find what they're looking for (lies to back them up) and those who are not will alternate between horror and laughter at what this book tries to do."
1,Scare them into Heaven,"I have read many commentaries on homosexuals and the church. This book dehumanizes the homosexual community. It tells lies about the homosexual community and it keeps homophobia going. This gives the people the Right to go kill or threaten homosexual people.If you read through church history and even read the Bible for what it is there is nothing in there about homosexual acts. I believe the best book out there that best tackles this topic called ""Dirt, Greed and Sex"" by William L. Countryman.For those that read the book and stated that they are scared of what ""agenda"" the homosexual community has, its beyond me. People do not do enough research and/or reading. I read both sides then come up with my own decission. I don't have someone else tell me what to believe, I search it out."
5,Startling and Sobering,"I just finished reading Sear's and Osten's book, and I am stunned. For those of us who have abided by biblical morals, the pressure is growing to succumb to a politically correct, homosexuality-affirming agenda. The subtitle of this volume reads, ""Exposing the principal threat to religious freedom today."" These words summarize the theme of the book.Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are both in the process of being curtailed in light of the new, growing state religion of tolerance. While many of us may not believe that American society could come to such a point, the authors present case after case to show how these freedoms are being restrained, and how if present trends continue these freedoms will be diminished even further.This title is an eye-opener for Christians with a biblically-based morality and sexuality. Get it, read it, and realize the great peril we face as believers who condemn homosexuality as a valid, alternate lifestyle."
1,"Silly, Shrill, and a little bit Funny","If I didn't know that some folks would actually believe this silliness, I could laugh more at this book. How sad that serious, REAL Christianity is continually given a black eye by people like this. There is virtually nothing here based on fact, and virtually nothing based on the Bible. This book represents the worst kind of misreading of Scripture and current events. Only a moron would take this stuff seriously. The only positive thing that can be said for it is that I did laugh out loud a few times."
1,Embarressed Christian,"I am so tired of anit-Christians embarressing (and saddening) the rest of us by their egregious, SINFUL hatred! Every point in this book revels the author to be just another of those self-rightious, ignorant, scared people who have no understanding of the Love of Jesus Christ, yet want to validate their fear and stupidity by saying and doing the most horrible things in the name of God.Please do the rest of us a favor. HATE in your our space and, please, actually read the first four books of the New Testament. Jesus Christ preached against judging others, summing up the whole thing by relating the Golden Rule! (It's right there in the New Testament in case you have no idea about what I am referring.)"
1,It should be called,The Christian Agenda: We must brainwash more people. This book is full of propaganda and lies. The authors should be ashamed.
1,Another Hate Filled Book from the Christian Right,"The Christian Right and Conservative Religions (as a human organization) by their very principles has always been a convenient land for right-wing authoritarians to stake their arguments against change. This has played out in every single human rights struggle pretty much ever. This books is a classic example of this syndrome, it's lies, it's misrepresentations... It is reminicent of the type of propaganda put out by Joseph Goebbels."
1,Typical Alarmist Drivel,"The authors' claims are unsubstantiated, with flawed reasoning and research. They are deliberately negative so as to further their own agenda of hate and intolerance. It is one thing to believe your god says it is wrong, it is another to deliberately and maliciously twist the facts of something so it fits what you want to believe. The former is merely a difference of opinion. The latter is downright dishonest.The glbt only want the same rights accorded everyone else. No more, no less."
1,A disgusting and horrifying read.,"""The Gay Agenda"" is more or less a book made by zealous idiots, for zealous idiots. It is interesting, and something the gay community should look into. But the fact that people are actually believing the propaganda in this book, is sickening."
5,Well-documented book of facts,"(...)Having read the book from cover to cover, I can tell you that the book is sensitively written and presents, as Bogart once said, ""just the facts."" Throughout the book, the authors never attack homosexuals either individually or as a class. Rather, they provide shocking fact after shocking fact, be it news items or court cases, that reveal the oppressive goals of the homosexual movement...including quotes straight from the mouths of the homosexual leaders themselves! You will be stunned to read that the homosexual leaders themselves admit to using lies, deception and propaganda in order to advance their cause and ""overhaul straight America"" because the ends justify the means.Furthermore, every fact and every quote is documented so that you can independently verify it for yourself if you don't believe it (and most of the time you won't).After reading this book, there is no way you will not be moved. (...)"
1,New Hate Object,"Now the religious right has a new punching bag. It used to be Jews, or women (witches). Jews, no matter how poor and downtrodden they seemed, were actually bent on world domination. Women - your wife, mother, daughter - were possessed of secret powers straight from the devil. Now it's the gays' turn. They are rich, powerful, subversive, out to torpedo all morality and goodness in this world. But maybe the people who are out to control the world are the exact same people who have been controling it for centuries - religious extremists."
1,Terrible...typical christian conversative muck,Hate and discrimination are family values in ultra-Christian households...
2,Gay threat to freedom,"Given that one group's civil rights can generally only be attained at the expense of another's, I can only feel a certain affinity with the sentiments of this book. Like many people, I am continually affronted by those leading an openly gay lifestyle, and I feel this to be an infringement of my rights. I feel marginalised, like my own rights are in competition with other groups around me. Gay homosexuals have dominated the discourse for far too long, and it's good to see their previously unassailable position of power and social acceptance finally challenged, even if it is challenged from such an underfunded, underdog position as ""Christianity"". My right to be morose and melancholy has been openly mocked for too long by the unrelenting merriment around me. It's good to see someone fighting back. I can't bring myself to give this book more than 2 stars, however, because of the disturbing depiction of gaiety on the cover."
5,A Must-Read,"Sears and Osten have done an outstanding job in exposing homosexual activism's true -- and ghastly -- agenda. This book can only help those of us who insist on fighting the good fight, despite tremendous odds. Truth be told, however, we've lost every single major battle since the Culture Wars began. Oh, we've won a few skirmishes and have successfully fought a handful of delaying actions, but that's about it. I suspect we'll lose this battle as well. What's that I hear? Oh, of course -- Western civilization's death rattle."
3,Brilliant!,"Alan Sears and Craig Osten, two of America's proudest homosexuals, have used this opportunity to showcase the level of ignorance which afflicts modern Islamic and Christian conservatism.Demonstrating the level of hatred to which a man can stoop, they have proved their worth as social commentators with this instant classic!"
3,I used to think this was crap ...,"I used to think this was crap until I saw a story from the Sunday 8-31-03 NY Times (that bastion of conservative thought) about homosexual marriage in Canada. The story quotes actual homosexuals saying that they want no part of marriage until they can redefine it and remove silly concepts like ""monogamy."" THAT is what people like the authors think will destroy marriage.While this book may have its flaws, it looks like it may be closer to reality than I initially thought."
1,Paranoid Psycho Babble,"Reading this book made me wonder my mothers old addage of a bunch of folk who don't have nothing better to do than cause trouble ... don't they have a job? Yeah, writing this sick paranoid thesis on hatred. This whole ""us verses them"" thing has to stop in this country (USA)... or our freedom is at an end.If you don't want to be homosexual ... then don't be, but playing politics as suggested is a terrifing exercise in fascism.In about 20 years all of this version of freedom of speach will come to an end ... yes, no more Focus on the Family, no more KKK, no more Fox news, just like spam is about to be outlawed so is the paraniod ramblings of talk radio. Bending logic and science to suit you doesn't make a country progress ... it makes it fall on its tail. I could come up with a dozen reasons why homosexuality is wrong, and still have no right to feel the need to down someone over their sexual impulses."
1,I can't believe this hateful book claims to be Christian!,"Christianity is about accepting Christ as your savior and about accepting and loving others.The only ""homosexual agenda"" is the desire to be treated as equals. The right to keep your job, the right to choose your domestic partner, and the right to be safe from violence are not special privileges. These are human rights that heterosexual people take for granted in their own lives."
2,not their best,"some good songs but overall not worth buying, i recomend just down load the individual songs you like"
4,Damn where you been?,"Its a solid album and they were very much missed. Its right back to business for them which is so refreshing to hear from these guys. Most of the tracks are hits for me. The only track that I can say really touches me on the album is ""flowmotion."" The reason this track is beautiful and yet hard to accept is because I keep expecting to hear bizzy to make that appearance but he isnt there, this is a signature Bone Thugs N Harmony track, but Im happy that they still come with it. Im tempted to say its at least top 5 hip hop albums of 2007."
3,Its Just Aight,Its an ok album...I would be rated 5 stars if they brought bizzy bacc...bring bizzy bacc bone!
4,C Rod is wack,"this is too that clown who wrote an earlier view. How silly do you sound? Bone can over emphasize gats, blastin fools. candy paint on the whip, more gats and ouija boards and sellin dope, but they put down ""one"" track about thanking God for their blessings and you trip talkin about over emphasizing??? lol. Fall back, son and eat fat one. By the way the LP is slick. go cop that."
1,bone thug n harmony suck please retire,"we don't wanna hear you praise the lord come on what's wrong with krazie, wish, and flesh and working with yolanda adams at that hell she ain't no saint this shows she wants a thug in her life if she's married her hubby better watch before she sleeps with these gangster rappers bone has gotten sorry over the years swizz beatz is the only one who had faith in these boys come on we wanna hear ouija boards, drugs, and death not so9ngs with freak azz mariah carey it's official I'm never listening to any new project by bone thugz n hatrmony I prefer all their classics."
4,Its About Time for this change,I admit it I've been a fan of Bone since the Faces of Death days truthfully probably their biggest fan but in all honesty Bone has disappointed me a few times. Its not their last few cds wasn't good its just that I know as well as all of you know that Bone can rip some trax when they want to. This cd (I hpe and pray) is a sign of their future cds because this cd is the first in a looooong time that I see them live up to their potential. They rip damn near every track almost as good as East 1999. This cd in my opinion is a great investment and a must have for every Bone fan or anyone who like fast tongue twistin rap. I give Bone nothing but love for this cd and pray that their next one is even just half as good.4.3 (its great but its no East 1999)
3,"3.5 Stars, Bone Is Back!","At 1st I hesitated to buy this CD, but I just got some Bone Thug fever from listening to some there older stuff likeE 1999 Eternal&The Collection, Vol. 1. I must say that I was very pleased once I actually picked up the album. Bone comes back strong with a solid album, with some really good production & guest appearances. All of the guest artists add to the album (Swizz Beatz, Akon, Mariah Carey, Bow Wow, Twista, The Game, will.i.am, & Felicia). But none of them helped the album as much as Bizzy Bone could, Bizzy's absence is what hurts this album the most in my opinion. But overall the outcome is good, and should please any Bone Thugs fan. My favorite tracks are; ""Flow Motion"", ""Wind Blow"", ""I Tried"", ""C-Town"", ""9mm"", ""So Good So Right"", and ""Never Forget Me"". I really hope Bizzy Bone comes back for their next album, Bone is at their best when all the pieces are together (just like Voltron)."
5,Just enough to deter without hurting the animals,"I have a large built painted steel enclosure where my cats can go outside and enjoy some outside sun and air. After I built the enclosure 10X20 and 8 feet high I was amazed how fast my cats climbed over and out. What to do? I electrified the enclosure about 4 feet up. I used the Zereba K9. It was simple and fast. I could not rely on the cats actually grounding on the ground, so I had to run a separate ground wire and placed it about three inches from the hot wire. If your smart also purchase the Zareba UFT universal Fence Tester. It saves you the two finger testing and the associated ZAP"
3,Problems??,"The music and video are wonderful. Whether live or on video Marshall Crenshaw is just enjoyable music. Too good for FM radio...Now onto the disc...The video is clear and crisp. The LPCM audio is very well mixed. What is strange is the 5.1 AC3 is very artificial and ""centered"" in the left channel. One of the strangest mixes I've heard.On top of this playing the disc results in some tracks being skipped. This occurs at the beginning of tracks only, so it isn't random dust or fingerprints.If it wasn't for the obvious mastering problems this would have been a 5 star."
3,"Half Good, Half Could be Better","There're plenty of recordings of two of the works on this disc (probably more than 20 of the Marosszek Dances) so it must be popular works, and Tortelier and his team have to have a special reason why they record it again for full price. After hearing the performances of the Overture and the Dances I again couldn't imagine why they did: decent readings but without the joy I recall having heard more than once in Budapest by native orchestras. It's in your blood or not. Try Dorati on Decca (I think it's out of print now) and you'll understand what I mean.I thought the Symphony and the Concerto faired better in these performances. That has been done too on Decca by Dorati and the Philharmonica Hungarica but those recordings are unavailable. The Chandos recording is better, but Decca's vintage 70s sound is also good. I think Tortelier is better in French music (try Boulanger)."
3,Cut to the bone,"I'll begin by saying that dealing with the seller was entirely satisfactory. The book itself, Kerson Huang's translation of the I Ching, is a flawed effort. Huang's long introductory chapters are engaging, literate, and informative. The actual body of the text is so spare, so lean, that there is little left to trigger the reader's own intuitive faculties. Huang's version of the I Ching strips away all of the Confucian commentaries and narratives, which is his goal. What is left is really not functional as a book of divination.I would recommend Huang's introductory material highly, and for this reason I do not regret the purchase. When it comes to practical divination, it will be necessary to look to other translations with more flesh on the bone."
4,Cutie,"Okay, so this Beanie may be considered ""old"", but Beanies are very good at making memories, and this one holds a special place in my heart. When I first received this Beanie at a young age, I was thrilled. After all, what little girl doesn't love something as cute and colorful as this pudgy worm? This is one that I'm positive will never end up in a garage sale. Though he probably isn't as nice and neat as he was when he was first purchased, that's what comes with years of play. I recommend him to Beanie Baby lovers."
2,Not as good as I thought,My daughter wanted a caterpilliar and I bought this for her. But this worm is not fluffy. You can get a better toy in a local store with this price.
4,Ghost Story,This is a terrific movie and still stands up today (although over 25 years old). The acting is excellent and was quite chilling in its time. 'Still a good yarn though.
4,Old school ghost story,"People haunted by a tragic event in the past,old friendships, a man who can't get over a lost love and who in fact loves something no longer of this world, Alice Krige as the haunting specter... and plenty more recommend this classic ghost story. Yes, the effects are sorely lacking by today's standards, but it is the storytelling and credible acting that carry this movie.This is truly a classic ghost story, and highly atmospheric. It is not too often that one gets to experience a dark, Gothic ghost story in the traditional sense. The lack of special effects does not detract from the storytelling - in fact, it is the credible acting that holds this movie together, coupled with the interesting plot.I love classic ghost/haunting stories and among my favorites are ""The Changeling"", ""The Haunting"", ""Burnt Offerings"", ""The Sentinel"", ""Audrey Rose"", ""The Lady in White"", ""The Legacy"", and many more."
2,"Novel: Excellent, Film: Not!","First, let me say that Straub's novel is one of the finest ghost stories ever written. It's terrifying, too, as good ghost stories should be. Hence, I had high expectations of this film. The fact is the film is dreadful! It's almost nothing like the novel, and the only reason I give it two stars is due to some atmosphere. The cinematography looks good. That's about it. Spend your money, sure, but spend it on the novel and you'll spend many dark evenings in your reading chamber casting furtive glances at those darkened corners."
3,critically drubbed and rightly so,"Having recently purchased a small bust of one of the apparitions from GHOST STORY, I watched the movie for painting reference...and as much as I like a good horror movie, this is nothing like a good horror movie. It seems very disjointed, the music is intrusive in spots...the only thing going for it in my opinion is Dick Smith's ghost makeup effects, and those are far too few."
1,Learn To Read,"Please don't buy the movie, buy the book. The movie is less than a foot note of the book. When I saw the movie had it not been for the fact that they mentioned Peter Straub's name, I would not have know it was based on his masterpiece. The book is THE ULTIMATE GHOST STORY whereas the best part about the movie is the all star cast.Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this production."
3,Ghost Story,"This movie was ok, the story itself was well directed, but it could have used better acting skills, and better special effects."
2,I couldn't get into it,"I rarely don't finish a movie just because I keep hopes up that it may improve somewhat. I was very intrigued with this one as I was searching for a good ghost story that didn't overuse computer generated special effects and was just plain creepy. I was even more interested with the star-studded cast. The acting was great as I expected, but I just couldn't get into the storyline enough to finish it. I got through about 20 min. of it and all resemblance to a ghostly story was completely lost. It hit me much more as an older suspense/thriller movie. It also wasn't very well put together. Dream sequences, flashbacks, etc. made it difficult to follow. I was really disappointed with this one."
5,ghost story review,"Great horror film, wonderful actors. One of my all time favorites. Thank you for getting it to me so quickly."
3,Thanks,"Like this movies, got it b/c it has been years since I have seen it, a good story from back in the day"
5,Dave Mccoy knows nothing,"I am not sure what film he was watching, but i was lucky enough to see it in the theater when it came out and many times on tape after. I still watch it every year at halloween. Yes i admit it seems slow at times but at the end everything comes together . A great film with some great old stars."
1,"Ghost story review-item not in condition for viewing, great movie non the less!","I remember watching this movie and wanted to see it again, so I ordered it, used. When I recieved it the amount of scratches on it would not allow it to play in my DVD player. I will still buy it but next time in better condition! I would not suggest anyone buy a DVD used, rather buy it in mint condition or at least real good condition. Thank you."
3,A hard movie to judge,"This movie was a hard movie to judge because the affects were corny, but the acting was fantastic! It had a good plot, but with such primitive affects you can't expect people to rate it very good!"
2,Too sexual,"I obviously had selective memory when it came to this movie, only remembering costumes, particularly scary scenes, production. I'd forgotten how the ghost seduced the men in the first half. Too much nudity & sexuality for me. It's a good story, & maybe I'm an old fogey now, but I'm going to give it to Goodwill."
2,Best Sex Scene Ever!!!,I haven't seen this movie since it appeared on HBO in the Fall of 1982 but I have fond memories of it. The scene that stands out most in my memory is the sex scene with Alice Kringe and her boyfriend. FANTASTIC!!!!! I wish this DVD wasn't out-of-print!
1,HORRIFYINGly bad.,"This has to be the worst horror film I have seen in a long time. It is utterly boring, and anti-climatic at best.I expected to see a horror film about a haunted old house full of wierd sounds and eerie happenings (like ""The Haunting"")....no such luck. A description like that sounds weak, but would have been better than this waste of time. And if any ""big haunted houses"" show up in ""Ghost Story"", the images are jumbled, boring, and annoying.The only plus in this movie is Alice Kridge.Avoid this one."
2,Boring...boring,"This movie has an intersting story line, but its soooo boring. I wouldn't recommend BUYING it, unless you are a Saratoga Buff... it was filmed there and the houses are beautiful!"
3,Not as scary as the book,"I read the book years ago and found it so scary that I would often have to put it down and take a break or hold off on a chapter if late at night. It scared me so much that I was jumping at slight noises and got shivers up my spine. The book was one of the best I've ever read. (I was heavily into King, Straub, Koontz, and Crichton at the time and thoroughly enjoyed spooky books. I still do.) Then I saw Ghost Story movie that I'd so looked forward to. The movie was enjoyable and occasionally intense but it lacked that total spooky character that I'd enjoyed so much while reading the book. I was disappointed. However, had I seen the movie alone or prior to reading the book, I'm sure I would have appreciated it much more than I did. My boyfriend couldn't understand my disappointment, since the movie scared him."
5,"Okay, I'm a chicken...","I can't get into creepy-ghoul movies, as a rule. But ""Ghost Story"" is a definite exception to the rule!! Is it the characters? Is it the plot? I couldn't say, and I really don't want to analyze it to find out. I just know that, for whatever reason, this is one GREAT movie!"
5,Ghost Story (...this one is not for a nervous disposition),"Actually, I thought this ""GHOST"" film was excellent. The acting was good and it really had so many shock moments in it. I watched it alone and wished I hadn't! Brilliant film. I would recommend it for the constipated among you!!Wonderful story, great SpecialFX. A definite must for horror fans.Meryl Heasman (songwriter) CATFLAP MUSIC."
2,things go DUD in the night,"first the good points of the movie,john houseman,douglas fairbanks jr.,melvyn douglas,and fred astaire! while not the best proformances these men ever gave it is great to see these old pro's at in again.now the bad news, they are saddled with a script that gives them nothing to do and even these gentelmen's talent can't make anything of value out of this mess about four elderly men who meet and tell ghost stories even as a ghost of a long ago shared sin is comeing back to haunt them. the story moves forward at a the pace snail and just dosen't ever pull you in.a wasted chance,but 2 stars for the 4 old pros and the little life that the movie has is because of them."
3,Ghost Story,"Really great spooky ghost movie, but way too much nudity for my taste. I donated it. Better on basic cable when they edit it out, uneccesary for the plot; at one point there rolling around the living room, so if that's your thing. Too bad, because the movie is good and it is mostly in the first third."
2,LAME GHOST STORY !!!,"I just bought this DVD, because all these hip an all. Man was lame as hell. Wasn't real horror AT ALL ,more was lame, then horror, I know what I am talking about because I am fan of a ghost and haunted type movies...Wish I could get my damn money back..If u really wants to see a ghost, haunted house and also is kind of classic is same years with this movie made? .get""The Entity""...I just bought ""ENTITY"" and I saw it back in 80s,Is real true chilling ghost story,& got me real shocked. Worth every penny I paid. Skip this lame trash,U would disappointed!!"
4,Great Movie,"I loved Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg in this movie. I loved where Whoopi and Patrick were making that pottery thing. I don't recall Demi coming alive in the sinking car, but I might have missed it. Was Fred Astaire in this movie, thought he was a dancer. Anyway, good flick..."
5,Best easy to read information,"I found this book soon after my diagnosis and found it both easy to read and to have helpful information. I have loaned it to several others with RSD and each has eventually ordered their own copy of the book. The last person I loaned it to never gave it back despite my asking for it several times, so I lost my personnal notes written in the margins. I would encourage anyone recently diagnosed with RSD/CRPS to purchase this book."
1,Living with RSD,"never received book, was old it wasout of stock after a week for the much needed book."
3,King Of The Mild Frontier,"Wow, what a book. This book is hilarious. The author, Chris Crutcher, is writing about his life growing up in the small town of Cascade, Idaho. I'm from Idaho and let me tell you it is one small town. He talks about all of the times his older brother John would play would play tricks on him to get him in trouble. I like this book because it reminds me of all the family dinners we've had where my mom's brothers would tell similar stories like Chris'.I like how the author shares his emotions with the readers. The way he writes, the language he uses, is verry real to the language that his target audiance speaks. All in All it was an ok book I think I would recomend it to an older audiance though because I think that they can relate to it more."
5,Just laugh-out-loud hilarious!,"This book is one of those that you'll look around to see with whom you can share the hilarious incident you just read because it's just too funny to keep to yourself! And then 3 pages later, you need to share again. Or if you tell a friend one part of the book, you'll find yourself saying, ""Oh, and THEN he ..."" with another and another! A fun read for any age from middle schoolers to their grandparents!"
4,Sharing Secrets,"Having briefly met the author I enjoyed this book immensely. Mr. Crutches bared his soul, sharing life experiences in an entertaining way. I will purchase a paperback to give my son who faces many of the same challenges."
3,"Nostalgia for sure, but audio and video lacking quality.","Agree with the other reviews on this dvd, just be prepared for some really poor quality video and not much better sound. I suppose it's all about how the original was taped, and considering the vintage perhaps to be expected. I was just a bit diappointed with both audio and video, but the band definitely showed up and rocked!"
1,Good lord this is horrible,"Forget about nostalgia. Watching this concert will scar your memories. I loved these guys in their prime and attended several concerts. Hoping to relive some of the joy through this DVD.This video is just a notch above bootleg and I mean a notch. At least they held the camera steady. The visuals are horrible. Grainy, extremely blurry and just a horrendous to watch. The audio will make you cringe. The balance is non existent. Some instruments you can't even hear, others are too prominent. All this just ruins the experience of trying to enjoy the concert. I regret reading and trusting the 'good' reviews of this DVD. This is not even remotely enjoyable to watch or listen to.I laugh in a hurtful way when it says bonus material. Whatever... It's one more song and it's recorded worse than the previous songs. This is a horrible product. I cannot get rid of this DVD fast enough."
5,What You Need To Know,"The Ozark Mountain Daredevils were among the most popular mid-'70s country-rock bands. These recently discovered video tapes of their memorable reunion concert, filmed New Year's Eve, 1980 at the Uptown Theater, Kansas City, Mo., feature their original lineup, along with later supporting members.* This was the first time in five years that the original lineup all played together.* First time available anywhere!* The DVD features their signature songs ""Jackie Blue"" and ""If You Wanna Get To Heaven.""* This live reunion concert is the first official DVD by The Ozark Mountain Daredevils."
5,"Outstanding Illustrations, Excellent Instruction","The Bombproof roll and beyond is an essential book for any novice or intermediate kayaker. This book does and excellent job of explaining through both text and illustrations the different steps involved in just about any roll imaginable (c to c, sweep, back deck, hand roll). It also provide excellent tips for identifying and correcting problems with rolls. An outstanding book. An essential in any kayaker's library."
2,Outdated and Not Very Helpful,"I teach rolling lessons on a weekly basis and I purchased this book because I am always trying to find new drills to use with my students. I find the more I watch other people teach and read about rolling the better teacher I become.This book was not helpful to me at all. I am proficient at each of the rolling methods described in the book and half the time I still couldn't make sense of what the author was trying to explain. I found myself having to pause and really think about things before the passage I was reading would click. I could only follow because I have the background knowledge to know what he is trying to get at. I can't imagine being a beginner and trying to teach myself how to roll based on this book.Note that most of the 5 star reviews from this book are several years old. Paddling has changed a lot since '93, the copyright on my book. I would recommend a EJ's rolling and bracing as a much more up to date alternative to this book."
2,coaching youth baseball,"The author does not know the actual fundamentals of baseball, incorrect hitting an bunting techniques. concentrates on the politics of youth baseball and not drills and skills."
4,Teaching Expectations,"First off... this is not a toy so I am not sure why I was asked to rate this item as a toy. It is a poster designed for use in the classroom. It is made out of poster board, laminate it and it will be useful for years to come. This is a great item that was recommended to me by several teachers to demonstrate how would should be listening in class. Learning to listen is something that has to be taught. This is a great reminder for young elementary students.I ran into several problems when ordering this item. First, I received the wrong item. The seller responded quickly, advised me to keep the item they mistakenly sent and would send me a new one. This is not sent by Amazon. The shipping costs were more than the poster itself. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive the first time and the same amount the second time. In all, I waited over a month for it to arrive. Again, this is something I would recommend buying locally to save on costs and waiting for it to arrive."
3,Pricey but works well,"Tried this for the first time the other day on a couple bikes in my Finish Line cleaner tool, and it did a really good job of cleaning them (as I would expect). I can't say I will get another one though, as this is quite pricey, and will probably look for an alternative at my local hardware store. Just need to find something that doesn't eat away at seals or plastic."
5,Absolutely Gorgeous but packaging so so,"I have wanted this pattern for a really long time but they are pretty expensive so I have put it off. I finally decided to just take the plunge and start buying it a place setting at a time. The prices at Amazon are great and they let you know when they have dropped in price. The sets are everything I hoped for. Only problem is that I have had two shipments arrive with broken saucers. In the big picture this is not a huge problem as Amazon replaced them immediately and returns were a piece of cake, but as it happened more than once I would think there must be a better way to package the sets. Still extremely happy with my purchases, they are more beautiful than I hoped and are worth every penny."
4,F is for Fun,This kids book has great real-life pictures of twins along with fun alliterative ABC words with each one. Would be great for exploring the pictures with toddler twins or learning to read with older kiddos. The pictures aren't quite colorful enough to catch an infant's attention yet.
5,Great ABC's and twin book!,I got this for my twin daycare girls. They loved it. I loved that it had both the Capital and lowercase letter. Their mom loved that it a frame in the back for their picture. T Is for Twins: An ABC Book is a great way to celebrate being a twin for young kids.
1,Oxymoron,"This book is not a typical ABC book. For example, M is for multiple, O is for opportunity, and X is for excitement. Most of the words represent concepts and not enough action words and nouns. The age range is 2-8 years old but an 8 year old would not be interested in an ABC book with no plot. On the other hand, a two year old would be hard pressed to understand the content. Whatever happened to monkey, owl and xylophone?"
3,it's ok,I bought 2 of these for my nephews when they went to VBS. It's not as easy to follow as I thought. They are 8 and 11. These books are probably better for teens
5,Kids Quest Study Bible,I have a boy 9 years old and a girl 7 years old both have learned so much from their Quest bible. They love to read it and take it to bible study and church. It has very informative questions and answers that even help parents!!
4,are we wired a certain way?,"Originally discovered during my training for interim ministry work, this book can teach you or a group just what a 'ttype' is and why and how important it can be in the practical aspects of spirituality,as we grow closer to an important part of our very natures"
4,Amy at her very best,"Amy at her very best. Intense, not for a beginner. Should look at DVD first to get familiar with moves, but by 3 tries, moves are learnt. It is only the first routine that is a bit intricate. But sweat you will. Excellent buy."
5,ENERGETIC,"IT TOOK ME A FEW DAYS TO GET THIS ROUTINE DOWN, BUT WHEN I DID THIS WORK OUT KICKS MY BUTT EVERYTIME. IT KEEPS ME INTERESTED, ITS VERY FUN AND ENERGETIC. I LOVE THIS WORKOUT"
3,"Except for the preview section, no advance notice of moves is given - way too difficult","The choreography here is interesting, I'll have to give her that. But I don't care how ""advanced"" the DVD is, instructors should always *teach* the workout when first giving the moves. This instructor gives no instruction, except for the ""preview"" section. The preview section only covered four of the dozens of moves in this workout, and it didn't cover them in the context of the other moves surrounding them. Way too hard to learn. Yeah, once I learn the moves I will enjoy not having the steps delineated slowly every time, but still, this workout will lose most of the people who try it."
2,Hard to learn,"It is what the title says, Advanced Step. I have several CD's and this one I can't get all the way through without getting frustrated with the complexity of step. I just want a good workout."
1,I need response from the seller..,"I decided to spend a little extra money to buy a manufactured Brother Tn-350 Toner and wish that I won't get a refurbished product or a defective one. I received the item on time. I didn't, however, opened it when I received it. I was trying to use up my old toner. Two weeks later, I opened the toner I purchased and found the toner is faulty...making strange noise and printing unwanted stripes...I sent email to the seller--Databazaar and haven't got any reply yet. I can only return the toner to Databazaar without notifying them since the return policy said a return must be made 30 days within invoice date.Now, school just starts and I can't print anything since my old toner is used up and my new toner is on its way back to the seller. And the worst part is that nobody seems care about it. I'm worried that I may end up spending $45.19 and getting nothing...."
2,Not quite as expected,"I ordered a remanufactured Brother TN350 Black Toner Cartridge. A cartridge arrived quickly and works in the printer.HOWEVER, the cartridge which arrived was not a remanufactured Brother cartridge, but rather a third-party cartridge. I specifically chose this item because it was a Brother cartridge, not a third-party cartridge.Since the cartridge is for my daughter in college, we do not have time to hassle with this issue, so for pragmatic reasons I have accepted the cartridge. However, the advertisements and picture are not correct."
5,No fuss shopping,"The cartridge was as advertised, saved me time and fuel shopping for it. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,OEM is best,Refills and brand X replacements are a waste of time and money. Save yourself some grief and frustration and buy from the original manufacturer.
4,"Fits other devices as well,, including 7820N",This is the cartridge for the popular MFC 7820N. See:http://www.brother-usa.com/mfc/mfc_detail.aspx?AREA=MFC_1&PRODUCTID;=MFC7820Nand check supplies. Odd that it's not described fully here.
1,Toner Purchase,I did not receive what I ordered. I ordered Brother toner and got generic recycled toner cartridge. Will never purchase from this company again.
1,Review of Brother Black Toner (TN-350),Brother Black Toner Cartridge (TN-350)I ordered the Brother Black Toner TN-350 and received TN instead which does not fit in my printer! Reported this to Amazon - but have not had a response! Unhappy.
3,"Works fine, but its not actually a ""Brother"" toner cartridge","The cartridge fits and operates just fine, but you should realize that it is not a Brother brand cartridge. It is some generic thing that would probably void the factory warranty. Since my toner was gone and my warranty has expired, I figured it was easier just to try it rather than send it back complaining that it wasn't actually a Brother brand cartridge. But its not really what I thought I was buying. And the delivery time was slower than normal Amazon shipping times."
1,Do not ask me to review,Please do not ask me to review.I did not even get the product.I had to wait a month to file a complaint.Now I have to wait 2 weeks to get a response.This is utter nonsense.You took money out of my credit card.Shame on you for acting so slow.Kick that seller out of you site.The seller does not even respond.
4,Great Savings,Saved a ton of cash over the price of the same cartridge at the office supply store. I would buy this again.
5,No complaints,"Shipped fast and item as described. It is the same toner you would find at any of the big box stores, not a knockoff. Will buy again when it's time for more toner."
2,FAulty product,"I've ordered, from Amazon, this product before as replacement cartridge for my Brother printer and never had a problem until this time. When I replaced the out-of-toner cartridge that was in my printer with this replacement cartridge the replacement failed in about three weeks time. My printer indicated it was out-of-toner. I removed the cartridge two times and shook it each time thinking that it would solve the problem. It did not. I telephone Brother and followed the representative's instructions and found that the security tape on the side of the cartridge had been ripped before I received it and was the cause of cartridge failure. I ordered another cartridge from Amazon to replace that one and installed it in my machine. Hopefully it will not fail me as the security tape on the side of the new one was intact."
3,brother refurbished toner,I bought a Brother's refurbished toner. I hope I received one because there was no indication that it was. It did not look like a Brother TN350- no markings. Price was right and it seems to print fine.
3,"As promised, but",The toner carteidge has a consistent spot at 1.5 inches on the left edge of portrait printing. Slightly annoying but not enough to return the item for the flaw.
5,lowest price!,"The Brother toner cartridge is working well. I ordered it from Amazon because it was the lowest price I could find, including shipping! It came quickly and as expected. I got the product I needed, for the lowest price I could find, AND I didn't have to leave my apartment to get it! Can't ask for more than that."
2,Received a refurbished cartridge,"When I bought the Brother TN350 Black Toner Cartridge, I was under the impression that I was getting a new cartidge (probably due to the picture), but received a refurbished cartridge. Other than that, the price and delivery were good."
5,It's toner,It's toner and it worked. What more could you ask for from toner? fast shipping and reasonable pricing. Thanks.
3,The cartridge lasted for 2 months,"Got the cartridge in time. It lasted for 2 months. The normal Brother cartridge from Office Depot lasts for about 4 months. Consider it is only about 1/4 the price of normal product, it is still a good deal.Pages printed out ok. There is a little dark spot on one corner of the page, but it is usable.Bob"
5,Aiming to please,Very happy with this company. They helped expedite my toner in order that my copier did not see any down time. Very considerate company to deal with
