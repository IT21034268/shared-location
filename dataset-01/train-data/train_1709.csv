1,Good Actress but HORRIBLE Singer!!!!,"This CD sucks and JO is helping the stereotyping of Spanish speakers. The LATINO things has a bad connotaction in this country. If you think about the real LATIN term that is a culture and language born in Rome you a correct, but when you talking about Spanish speaker it became a stereotyping things. BTW Latin is someone speak one of the Latin languages. Not hispnics (people speak Spanish) only. The Americans or Anglo, German, Irish, African and Jewish origin should learn that. So to finish my lesson Jennifer Lopez sucks as a singer!!!!!"
3,maybe if she wasnt too busy with her love life...,"maybe if jlo wasnt too busy with her love life she could of made a decent album.. i mean cmon..""dear ben?""..ugh..gag me.. some of the songs are good..SOME.. shes gotten too mushy.. she shouldnt be making ballads, she doesnt have the voice for it. she should stick to fast songs."
4,J-Lo Glows!,"Jennifer's love for Ben Affleck is pretty evident in every song on this album! It's actually endearing! I hope everything works out for her this time around! Anyway, favorites are the more upbeat songs...""Jenny From The Block"", and the Carly Simon remake, ""You Belong To Me"". ""Still"" has a nice funky beat. This album is a nice change and something to listen to at work or while cleaning the house! While Jen doesn't have the strongest vocals, the harmonies are nice. I recommend this album for anyone who's been a fan of J-Lo!"
1,NO TALENT SINGER SHOULD LEAVE OUR EARS ALONE .,Boring music from a boring singer in a boring music industry .Pop music has been in severe decline over the past 20 years and this album is sadly part of this decline.I hope things change for the better soon or the only types of singers left will be like J-Lo .Makes me want to puke .
1,She needs to go back to then!,"Wow...is all i have to say...and not in a good way...on her previous albums, J. Lo's mediocre (at best) voice was covered by hot music and tight lyrics...but now...her voice is front and center..adn the result is chaos...this album truly highlights how little, if any, vocal talent she has...and the material...with the exception of jenny from teh block and all i have...is mediocre...she could've done so much better than this fluff album...if u want hot beats and okay singing from j.lo...pic up her ""J.Lo' album instead...she released the two songs worth having."
1,Don't waste your money on it,"Very disappointing, don't waste your money on it. There's not really much that can be said about an album this bad. She really should stop trying to be so urban when she's not.Working with rappers will not give her street credibility. And She really should take singing lesson's before recording an album. Save your money and buy mariah carey's new album (charmbracelet), now that's worth getting."
5,I like It,"Jennifer Lopez has made so much for herself in the past few years out of pretty much nothing. I very much respect her for that, and I think this album is her best yet. It is so personal to her, which is why it is so good. It is new but I like it."
3,"Better than I expected, however not the best","Now, when I heard Jenny From The Block, I though the album was gonna have a lotta hip-hop songs. However, I was wrong. Now, I'm not saying it's a terrible album, it's just kinda boring. ""Still"" is a pretty good song along with ""I'm Glad"", ""Again"", and ""U belong to me"". The best songs r ""All I Have"" with LL Cool J, and ""The One"" (both versions). However it's not the best. Another dissapointment was a lack of tracks...."
2,Nothing great,"I was pretty disappointed by this album, 'cause it lacks the beat and soul that J.Lo used to have in her other albums.She's trying to sing too many love songs and it doesn't really suit her. She's got a song 'Dear Ben' for her new fiance, but apart from that, none of the love songs have any meaning. The only good song is her duo with LL Cool J 'All I Have'. Even this song isn't anything great, but it's the best one on the album. All of them are too slow and you don't even know when one changes to the next; they're all too similar. I think she's in a really lovey-dovey mood 'cause of dear Ben, but she shouldn't let that ruin her album like this.She says the same things in all the songs and it gets really boring...."
4,pretty good album,"i can understand why others didnt like this album. i too, at first, didnt like it but after listening to it several times started to like it. i admit that this album needs a lot of improvement in its lyrics. i like to listen to music with a good beat and this album does have music that i like. for those that really want an album with good lyrics, do not buy this album. this album is not as good as her first album... so do not buy it expecting it to be as good as her other ones."
2,Disapointing,"I love Jennifer's past 2 albums but this one just doesn't deliver. There are no real upbeat songs (aside from 'jenny from the block') nothing like ""im real"", ""aint it funny"", or ""waiting for tonight"" there are no spanish flavored tracks, just a lot of mid tempo r&b songs. I like mid tempo songs, but Jennifer is just missing that something... The songs are kinda boring, nothing really exceptional on here. I dunno, i was disapointed. This album is just missing that something special that her previous 2 had. (Not to mention the awesome remix album)."
5,This Is Wonderful,"I think her new cd is great! Her J-Lo cd (the second cd) was real bad I thought she could of done much better. So I wasn't expecting much from this one. When I heard ""Jenny From the Block"" I got hooked, as are all her 1st singles from all her cd's it is awsome she catches your attention right away and makes you want more. The song ""Dear Ben"" is good it gives you an idea of how much she really loves Ben. Right now she is on top with her new movie her new cd and her love life with Ben. I hope she stays around for a long time because she is just so great she hasn't disappointed me with this one!"
3,"Different, but good","This CD is not bad...it is very lovely. It is not as good as her other albums in the ""let's dance/get the party started"" aspect, but when you are in the mood to just mellow out or snuggle up with your honey, its sweet and you can tell she really put her heart into it. Personally, I am a huge dance/latin music fan, and am a bit disappointed that she doesn't have any solid dance tracks and is missing that distinct latin feel that really made her so special to begin with. Not a single song in spanish either. I love her duet with LL Cool J, and really like the old 70's song intros she samples, but wish she had up'ed the tempo on this album. All in all, it's not bad, but I'd keep her old CD's close by if you really want to party."
2,She should go back to Then!,"This cd is pure [junk]. I usually give cd's two or three run throughs to pick up on the song beats and riffs that I didn't catch the first time. But on the 5th time through, I haven't found one song worthy of any acclaim. Dear Ben - has to be the worst song on the cd - did JLo pen this herself? She should just sing and not write! In all honesty I am having a hard time finding who wrote any of the songs... I wouldn't claim them either. There are no dance beats just poorly written ballads. Jenny From the Block is by way an expression of this cd. And if she really still believes that she was from the block, she wouldn't have to keep saying it, she would show it."
1,Blah,"This CD is quite boring. With the exception of Jenny From the Block, there is not a single upbeat song on it. Its full of ballads and they aren't very good ones either. They all sound the same and have the same beat. Her other CD was much better."
2,"If you liked her earlier releases, this is not for you.","I know that some will say, Jennifer's (Jenny, J.Lo, whatever) newest release, is a much more mature effort. This may be true. But in this case mature translates to boring. There are not more than three songs on this entire album, worth listening to more than once. In fact, even the singles that she has realeased from this album, aren't that great. Possibly the best track on this album would have to be ""The One"", and truthfully, the bonus track ""The One Version 2"" is actually better. Her duet with L.L. Cool J, ""All I have"" is an all around great song. Nice vocals, Ok lyrics, and the rapping is pretty great. But all in all, this album just can't hold my attention for more than five minutes at a time. Her voice leaves something to be desired, and her writing skills are deffinitely lacking. I certantly hope, Mrs. Jennifer Aflec, goes back to her Latin/hip-hop roots on her next album."
1,E.go,"That should be her nickname instead of Jlo. First of all, She CAN NOT SING IF HER LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. Anyone who says otherwise is a complete fool. I would love to see her perform any song without the help of prerecorded tracks and instraments which would mask her horrible voice. I would pick the Star-Spangle Banner. Next, she has some nerve saying that she just ""Jenny from the Block"". Sure, you are. I guess that's why you moved your whole entourage from one hotel to another one right down the street in a fleet of limos just because P. Diddy might have stayed there. Finally, anyone who has bought any of her albums should be dragged out into the streets to be shot in the back of the head."
1,"okay, remember when...","remember when music use to be real, and you didn't really ""feature"" anybody, it was usually just you. You didn't sample, the music use to be yours totally, totally origional. Remember when J.Lo had a single that didn't feature someone? It's getting hard but think ""waiting for tonight."" J.Lo forgot her pop roots and went totally RnB and it doesn't work. ""jenny from the block"" is a sad attempt at a song, ""All I Have""?? All I have to ask is ...what was that?!! It was not even good or inspired, and talk about deep lyrics, ""My pride is all I have..."" oh just kick me instead Jennifer Lopez. ""Still"" and ""Loving You"" are just boring, as is the rest of the album. However the reason this would even get a one star rateing (even though amazon doesn't give no star ratings... shame really) would be Jenny's cover of ""You Belong To Me"" a Carly Simon song... Jenny take note, that is what you should be doing!"
1,true music fan,although very much improved because there was no way to be worse than before. but this is no real talent she sales because of her looks that is all fine but please stop acting like this woman is talented although her fame and money is well deserved because she strived and worked hard for it but i can't ever see her becoming an true artist....
1,Actress turned singer...I don't think so,Being the highest paid Latina actress in Hollywood doesn't gurantee you talent in a singing career babe. Her squeaky singing voice is annoying just like her typical cocky celeberity attitude! I swear I think celebrities get so bored they think they can just branch out into any field they'd like...NOT!!!
1,Dont get it!!,"This CD is not worth your money!! It sounds like J. Lo, or Jenny, or whatever she wants her name to be for this month is going down, and is not making money from her music. She should stick to appearing in movies. She kinda has that down..., but in the music industry, she needs to hang it up!!"
1,I'M HOPING THIS ALBUM WAS SOME KIND OF A JOKE...!,"... BECAUSE I WAS EXPECTING TO LISTEN TO SOME GOOD MUSIC, NOT GARBAGE!!! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY... I'M WARNING YOU!! DO NOT BUY THIS, TRUST ME! I DEEPLY REGRET IT... WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE NICE UP-BEAT TRACKS LIKE ""LOVE DON'T COST A THING"", AND ""WAITING FOR TONIGHT"". THE WHOLE ALBUM IS BASICALLY HER SQUEALING OVER MUSIC BECAUSE WITH THAT KINDA VOICE, SHE SHOUDLNT EVEN HAVE A RECORD CONTRACT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH, BUY THE NEW MARIAH ALBUM, ""CHARMBRACELET""!!! IT'S ONE OF MARIAH'S BEST AND SHE CAN ACTUALLY SING, UNLIKE J.LO..."
3,not toooooooo bad,"Comparing with her previous J.Lo make better things this time. Although first 6 songs sound like one long drip of molasses, the entire production is far better than it used to be with the first two records of hers. However, if you've given up on looking cool, this record is exactly for you. But if you like good music, spend you money on something else. And J.Lo-STOP SINGING!!!!!"
1,if ....,".....she was jennifer rosenblatt with a flat back,would people(mostly the lonely lil boys who drool over anyone/THING with a pulse)still think this nevershouldhavebeen had talent ?!?!?!?!? shes right up there on the lameometer readings with lohan,duffy,the simpleson chicks,janet j,agvrile whatever,etc.only thing is j-low-on-talent is a latina from 'round the way.from being an insignificant 4thy string dancer to an over hyped rearend is truly hysterical.she better thank good for the tone deaf,sexless males for her mansions."
3,its all right,"The only songs that I like is: The one & jenny from the block. The songs don't really reflect jennifer ""back then"" as the title of the cd suggests. It just reflects her life now especially one song called ""dear ben"" <-that song is embarassing to her now since Bennifer is no more. I don't recommend singing about current boyfriends on albums and don't put them on your videos. I didn't like the vibe of this cd because like another reviewer said it has this 70s soul vibe but not one that I particularly enjoy."
1,No war stories. Only trivial snapshots,"Dont know whether Koppel had set the wrong questions or not, or he simply tried to gain quantity over quality (19 respondents in 190 pages), the answers from those 19 respondents, and thus the book itself, had been very boring and superficial. It's not that the 2 books of Market Wizards had set so high a standard for these interview type of trading books, but this one is just so poorly written. I had not read Koppel's other books but this one had scared me away."
2,Another Koppel quick book!,A poorly put togeather book with facile interviews. Jack Schwager's Market Wizards books have set a new standard for this type of book. Koppel has missed the boat again. Sloppy.
4,Captures what makes traders tick,"There are no sure-fire trading success strategies here, but the author does capture what it takes to be a professional trader. I found it interesting how he accomplishes this by having them ""chat"" about issues in their lives and areas of their interest that on the face of it seem to have little to do but in reality everything to do with trading. A definite keeper."
5,Koppel presents the world of trading as it is!,"Bulls,Bears and Millionaires is a much more authentic look and analysis of trading than anything else on the subject. It accomplishes what Market Wizards only hints at. By far the best book about the ups and downs of the trading life."
1,Did not fit my Honda Civic DX,I bought this bracket based on the description stating it would fit on '88 - 2000 Honda Civics; the Honda dealers wanted over $100 for the original bracket parts (my car was sold to me without a front license plate bracket). When the bracket arrived it did not even come close to fitting. The only fortunate part was it was made of a soft plastic that was easy to cut. After making several adjustments with a hack saw blade I was able to make it fit.
2,Not really worth the money,"For the price of a simple hunk of plastic that you will end up cutting and modifying to get it to fit your particular car, I would expect a better fit or at least, and preferably, a cheaper price."
2,Won't last long,"I bought this for my old camcorder hoping to have longer record time, but it still doesn't last long."
3,Its not as good/sharp as Tim Hill's Win NT Shell Scripting,"I have covered about a third of this book and so this review is not exhaustive. Having found Tim Hill's book at times too challenging or lacking basic explanation on some topics, I have found this book to be a good substitute. However its flawed with errors i.e. on redicting input and output - on appends etc. So if you are going to use this book, better have a substitute for cross checking some of the syntax and commands or manually try each command and example provided in the book and hopeful figure out the mistakes, if any...So far, I have therefore found Stanek's book very useful and also erroneous in some instances."
2,Not for experienced MS programmers,"This book may be OK for those new to administering Windows NT or network guys who have no programming experience. But if you have any experience with Visual Basic, ASP, VB Script, or even if with old MS-DOS, I think you'll find the book to be of little value."
1,wrong part in box,they sent this part to me part #pr203 but part # 207 was in the box 207 will not fit call they said some one at parts would call been about 2 weeks no call
2,Not what I was expecting,"Since I own the audiobook of Entertaining Mr Stone and find it absolutely delightful, I was hoping it was indicative of Ms De Costa's overall style. This book is ok; well written, grammar and syntax mostly good, dialogue acceptable, but I found it just... ok; certainly not particularly, uh, stimulating. YMMV, but I would have been happy to remain a stranger to The Stranger."
2,Don't buy it for the nature sounds or radio.,"I've had this alarm clock for about three years. As far as alarm clocks go, it's nothing special.The pros: It works reliably and is easy to set. The large numbers and lit snooze button are easy for me to see without my glasses.The cons: The audio is a poor, tinny quality. I've never been able to use the radio or nature sounds because they're just awful. Also, after about two years the red finish started to wear off of the plastic around the buttons I use most frequently.In sum, it's a perfectly serviceable alarm clock, but not worth more than about $15-$20 in my opinion."
3,Rebel - Fearless #7,"I awaited this book, but it wasn't the best of the series. I thought more action was going to happen with the characters, but the characters only ended up playing this juvenile truth or dare game. I did like the fact that the whole Tom-Katia-Gaia-Loki connection was explaned. That was awesome. And forget Sam, Gaia needs to go for Ed. And Ella needs to get a life and not sweat over Gaia."
5,Pretty good,"Well, it wasn't my favorite, but this book did reveal some more of the twisted history in Gaia's life. And a little action with Ed...She and Ed need to get together. But I look forward to see what will happen with Mary, who has fallen into Loki's bad graces."
4,well well well,"I have to admit, this was not one of the greatest books. I did like however that some of the mystery of Gaia's past has been explained. I have read some of the other reviews saying Gaia and Ed should get together. I don't agree. They are meant to be best friends. Not more than that. Sam and Gaia have a deeper connection. One beyond words, you can tell they're soul mates."
4,Another great Fearless book,Like alot of other people I wait anxiously for each of the fearless books to come out. I was totally surprised to find out #7 was about the game truth or dare. I wasnt as happy with the book until the whole thing with Gaia and Ed happened. That totally made the book great. I cant wait to see if anything happens with them in Heat.
5,Rebel,I think that this is one of the best books that I have read ina while(minus the rest of the Fearless books).
5,#1 BOOK,I loved the book. It keep me interested through the whole time I was reading it. I have read the whole series and every time I pick up the book I felt like I was in their world. And I hope Sam and Gaia get together.
5,Fearless #7: Rebel -- Amazing addition to the series.,"Mary Moss is still being stalked -- by the one person who will not stop to find her until she pays him a debt. Gaia Moore will protect Mary, no matter what. Together, they must take on Mary's deadly enemy -- friends will do anything for each other. Such as sharing secrets. But can Gaia give her secret up even to Mary? Which choice will be more painful? Among the best of this phenomenal series, REBEL is tight-packed with action, drama, and gripping sequences. It is an excellent book and I didn't expect it to be quite this good."
4,Great treadmill!,Wow! I just got off after a good workout. The treadmill works very well and there is no noise or vibrations. The set up was easy and the guy who delivered it was fantastic - he actually brought it to the room where we planned o set it up.There are two small problems I have though (hence not a 5 star rating)1. The magnetic safety clip is too weak and with a slight touch it falls off great in case of an emergency I guess but the machine stops dead and ruins your workout.2. The console programming is very confusing and not easy to customize.
2,Definitely not written by MOSES!,"This book has nothing to do with either Judaism or Moses. It has long been regarded as a medieval forgery. Jews were often burned at the stake by the Inquisition for supposedly practicing sorcery, and books like this were used as the ""proof"" that such sorcery existed. In other words, it's the Jewish equivalent of the bogus ""Malefactorum"" used against pagan witches. It probably has some value in terms of the history of witchcraft and other gentile magicks in Europe, but if you are looking for authentic Jewish mysticism, this ain't it. The spells are absolute gibberish if you know even rudimentary Hebrew, and they contain so many Catholic elements that I burst out laughing. I mean, how could Moses, who lived around 1200 B.C., have used an incantation invoking the Virgin Mary? Talk about ridiculous anachronisms!"
3,One of the better versions of this text,"All of the various issues of this volume share the copy machine look when it comes to the printing of the various plates. This one is, as good as any I have seen.It is far superior to ""The Sealed Magical Book of Moses"" which actually leaves out much of the material of this text, inserts too much material that doesn't pertain to the historical material, and is printed in a single sided format, in a plastic report binder."
2,What happened to the originals?,Bought a pair about 2 years ago that I loved. The quality of the construction on these has declined terribly. They are flimsy and are not actually the same pair of pads as they are advetised to be.
1,not the same old units!,"Donald S. is correct I also bought some for the shop a while back left positive feed back.Tried to buy more they were not avaliable at that time , checked again and there they were.Purchased 3 sets wiped out the ones I was using the first day... NOTHING like the old pads.I wore out the velcro straps before tearing up the rubber on the old units. New units litralyfell apart...BIG disappointment. Wonder if the Fiskars 94180 are the same. or better."
5,Very comfortable,"I agree with the Seattle reviewer's remarks. In addition:These pads are much more comfortable than the WM brand I bought last Spring ... those had 2 straps which dug into the back of my knees at the bending point and caused minor chaffing and scrapes (bled a little actually). These pads only have 1 strap, which fasten with velcro comfortably; not tightly like the wm pads. And, like the other reviewer said you forget they're on.I recommend these knee pads. I use them for outdoor garden and landscape work mainly. Just finished an edging project and didn't have any sorness like the wm ones I started out with."
4,Great new twist on the Bob series!,"We weren't sure about this one based on earlier reviews, but thought we'd try it. We have a 3-year-old Bob devotee who would definitely know if he saw a sub-standard Bob movie, but he absolutely loves it. He loves seeing Bob and his brother at the end. The tractors are great in this one and the addition of Lennie and the Lazers is great. The movie is a great advance in the team's animation and cinematography (not that 3-yr-olds care about that, but it makes it more enjoyable if you're an adult). The writing is fresh and enjoyable, and the characters are crisp and fun. The mayor is bossy, but hey, there are people in the world like that, good or bad. Everyone works together just as always. This movie is a lot of fun!"
2,My 3 1/2 year old was bored,"My son, a huge Bob the Builder fan, told me he was bored and when it was finally over, he said ""Is it Over?, Good"".It is not at all like the regular episodes. There were a lot of new characters to keep track of too."
4,"Good Metaphysics, Questionable Embryology","I first read Ford's book and was fascinated by his argument. I found his utilization of Thomistic metaphysics convincing and inspiring as he negotiated a middle course between the traditional Church teaching and the performance theories of those such as Peter Singer. However, despite my clinging belief that Ford's metaphysical analysis is sound. I have encountered enough critiques of his embryological analysis to call his overall conclusions into question. I think this book is still a thought-provoking read for those interested in tackling the subject of the origin of the human person. However, Ford's metaphysical analysis is only as good as the science to which he applies it. Caution is warranted."
5,A Pocket Full of Information,I use this book every day in clinicals as a Nursing student. I own 2 other drug books but they now sit on my computer desk.
3,"Good product, but not sure if I'd purchase again","The HeatShield is a perfect fit for my vehicle & is well made & so far seems to be good for keeping a parked car cooler. Will be able to tell more about this in mid-summer. However, the reason I give it 3 stars is how this shield must be stored. It does not fold flat for storage. It must be rolled & held closed with a Velcro strap. Therefore, it takes up a lot of room because of the length, making it bulky. I keep it laying on the floorboard of the second seat; however, I can't do this with passengers sitting in the back. It is somewhat of a hassle."
1,DOA,"I ordered this product because I wanted to be able to charge several different devices while camping. I had read reviews of small inverters and many didn't work. I didn't find negative reviews on this product. It arrived promptly. When I tried to use it, it was doa. I flipped the on/off switch several times and I would get an intermittant flash from the on switch on light but the unit never produced an output. I suspect it's just a defective switch."
2,Fell well short of my expectations,"Have been through 2 returns with Cingular now and I still cant hear out of one side of the headset. Have tried the headset on a Blackberry and Sprint version of the 8125, worked there.Windows Mobile still needs to mature. There is no way to set a beep incase you have missed a call or an SMS (if you were away from the phone or something). No way of knowing you missed a call unless you actually look at the display. The process to set mp3 ringtones and SMS/EMail alerts was extremely painful as well."
2,Great PDA but poor phone,"I love PDA phones and have used the Treo 650 and now the 8125. This is my 3rd 8125.The PDA part of the device is quite wonderful. I could recommend a few improvements, but mostly the PDA is great. I would really like to hark about the phone part of this device which is absolutely horrible. It is the worst phone I have ever used. I drop calls every few minutes and sometimes seconds while on the road. Remember, this is the third 8125 I have owned and they all do the same. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with Cingular toubleshooting. My cheap Nokia never dropped calls like this phone does. In fact, my wife could be in the car beside me talking on her cheap Nokia (she uses Cingular also) and never drop a call, while I, on my expensive 8125, contiuously drop calls. This has to be cell phone hell. I am looking into the HP 6515. I don't know if it is any better. I know it is an older machine, but it can't be any worse than this poorly engineered device."
4,"Usability issues with software, hardware is great","My wife has the Palm Treo 650 that has much better usability i.e. you can use it single handed when driving et al and its battery lasts longer. I had to buy the 8125 instead since I absolutely wanted the wifi that was missing from the Palm.The 8125 phone build quality is solid and functionality is better than most competitor products that I evaluated when I bought it. The battery life is decent and lasts for about 5 days with nominal usage. I've dropped it once and it survived without any issues. It's voice quality is better than Motorola RAZR that I used before. It does not drop calls either. I only have two issues with it. Firstly, dialing a phone number while driving is difficult due to small soft dialpad. Secondly, voice recognition is primitive i.e. it is based on voice tags so don't expect it to work well."
3,Feature is excellent but quality is poor,I bought this 8125 phone 40 days ago. PDA screen alignment has gone crazy. I can't do anything with it. I tried all the options what Cingular suggested. They are replacing now. Let me see how it goes.
2,Endless Trouble,"Endless trouble only begins to describe it. Is there a rating with negative stars?It is a black hole of time. It costs $200 but will require dozens and dozens of hours of time.If your time is computed at the minimum wage, you'll clock thousands of dollars before you ever get it to work.Customer service is friendly but cannot get it right twice in a row.Synchronization works rarely, email is haphazard, PDF is virtually useless because it cannot open most files. Memory allocation is bizarre.Vastly overpromises and underdelivers. Grossly unreliable. Like most Microsoft products: Monumentally frustrating; not ready for use."
3,Never received it !!!,"I am giving it 3 stars because I am unable to rate the phone yet. I ordered it about a week back and was supposed to get it in 2 days. Amazon website kept saying that there is a delay in your order. I called them up and they said that they have not received an approval from Cingular. They were nice enough to upgrade the shipping to next day delivery upon receipt of approval. But apparently they never heard from Cingular and automatically cancelled the order.So I am not really sure whose fault it is but one thing is for sure, I am not going to order from Amazon or go with Cingular wireless. As for the phone I simply couldn't say."
1,Big problems with Data!,"This phone has several big problems:1) First of all, it has known sync problems. In my case, data would sync from Outlook, but not correctly. Dates were changed, times were changed, big garbled mess. I spent 5 hours with tech support who finally told me that it was a bad phone and to return it.2) The clock resets itself to whatever time it thinks it should be. Very annoying.3) Difficult to use. I was able to teach myself all functions within an hour, but the touch screen is very difficult to use unless you are stopped on the side of the road and using both hands. Not too user friendly. I had it less than 24 hours before I returned it and got a Blackberry."
2,I just don't know.,"I bought what may be a wonderful phone, etc. but I just dont know. There is no users manual except for a CD that only runs on Windows. Cingular is maybe unaware that not everybody uses or wants to use Windows. There does not seem to be any other recourse. My phone died. I was forced to sacrifice a morning hoping to find a competent sales person in my local outlet. After a very visible tantrum, the manager appeared and showed me how to fix the phone, without tools.I bought a phone filled with features that I cannot understand. The phone and screens are not intuitive. Prospective buyers should force the sales people to demonstrate the phone at length and then explain how to obtain a working guide. Otherwise, Caveat Emptor!"
2,this phone is good,i want all buyer to buy this phone it is good to all peopel to use it have all things in it okthankchris
3,muy buena,"Realmente me parecio una historia muy bonita, con algunas risas y sobre una historia de tolerancia de la familia y la importancia de la honestidad con ellos"
5,DVD - Times Have Been Better,Times Have Been Better was an excellent coming out story. I highly recommend it as it is one of the better gay films. It is a funny tear jerker with a very interesting story line.
1,Don't bother,A crappy two hours of horrible drunk disfunctional parents. Made me grind my teeth. Nothing about the two men and romance. And a useless brother character who was completely wasted. Pass on this one. Horrible!
4,I really enjoyed this!,It's hard to leave a review for the whole book because each story is different. I did enjoy them all.
3,Not A Very Memorable Book,To be honest I read this book and after I put it down I didn't really remember anything about it. I like to read books that I remember and can think about . . . not the case here. Even after reading the summary of the book I had a hard time remembering what it was about. Hopefully the other books in this series are better.
2,Prefer Olfa over Fiskars,"I used the Fiskars cutter for years and was never very satisfied with it. I recently switched to the Olfa 45mm Ergonomic Rotary Cutter and there is a big difference.This Fiskars cutter has a hard handle so pushing down on it is not comfortable which makes cutting uncomfortable if you're doing it for a long period of time (like cutting pieces for a quilt).One of my biggest complaints about the Fiskars is that it ""skips"" when you cut. It is not a smooth cut - there will be sections of the fabric that are not cut, even after putting in a brand-new blade. So you have to go over your cut a couple of times to go all the way through the fabric (even with only one piece of fabric). This does not happen with my Olfa cutter.Overall. I think there are much better cutters out there for the same price."
4,A Story With A Unique Perspective For Daily Life,"3 to 8 yrs. Some may find this book objectionable in that they may believe that its underlying message for children is 'work is bad.' But that doesn't seem to be the author's intent. It seems to be more observational then as a teaching tool.Based on a passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walden, the story is about Henry--the main animal character (bear?) in the story--and his friend, who decide to go to Fitchburg. Henry chooses to walk the 30 miles, while his friend plans to work, so that he can earn enough money to ride the train. We then bounce from character to character to witness what they are experiencing in their quest to get to Fitchburg.Good illustrations, and interesting story providing ample discussion material for parents and children, about the different meanings this story possess."
5,Charming,"This book is very well written and illustrated. In this day and age, children should be reminded that there's more to life than constantly striving for material possessions, that taking time to enjoy the great outdoors (as well as using that time to think and reflect on life in general) is important, and always has been, and always will be. This book does a superb job of instilling that appreciation of nature and the benefits of time spent in solitude. I read this book to a 7 year old, and I'm pretty sure I enjoyed it more than he did. It's simple, yet speaks volumes in its simplicity. Enjoyable on many levels, this is a wonderful gift for a child, and his parents will thank you."
3,Little kids might miss the point,"This was a great idea for a book. I really liked the fact that it tried to introduce young chidlren to philosophical ideas. However, after listening to the story, my 4-year-old insists that he'd rather be ""Henry's friend"" (who works all day to earn money to ride the train) rather than Henry (who walks) because he's much rather have a train ride no matter how much work was involved. I think I'll shelve this book for another year and then try again."
5,Wonderful classic!,This book is fantastic. Its illustrations are lovely and the story is a classic.Highly recommended.
4,A good one,"My grandson, who is six, especially enjoyed the arithmetic lesson in this book, as Henry's friend adds up his earnings steadily. He was also interested in seeing which bear got to Fitchburg first. The illustrations are charming, and the story wears well for repeated reading. As for the references to the Alcotts and Emerson and Henry the Bear's likemindedness with Henry David Thoreau, that's just an extra for adults."
5,Not all that good,This book is a bit too convoluted and indirect about the things it must cover in order to make you an effective VB5 ActiveX programmer. I've seen it done much more efficiently. I got two thirds of the way through it and had to lay it down.
2,Not a begginers book,"I purchased this book from Amozon, attempted to read the first 3 chapters and returned it all within 24 hours. The writting is very unclear and I had a hard time following the topics. It was difficult to tell what they wanted us to try and what they were they were trying to explain. Maybey somebody with a few more years of experience in Visual Basic may have found this book usefull, but if you are new to VB, I strongly recomend against it."
4,"Alice, Thanks for taking us to Wonderland","All I can say is, ""Am I the only one who cares about ""Queen of the Rodeo""?"" It is THE MUST HAVE TRACK from this collection!!!!"
4,This is great,This is a great collection of songs by a great band. I wish they were still around though. The best songs are on Cd 1 and 2 in my opinion.
3,Not Complete,"I Do enjoy this box set as it has demo's, re-mixes and the 2 new songs recorded for it that are really, really good!! However, this is not a complete box set, I would have been happier if this box set included all of their songs ever recorded. There is a fourth cd that is included and is interactive. Other than the video clips....this cd is complete crap. Why could they not have used this cd to include more of their songs? There are amazing songs off of Jar of flies and sap.... too bad. Maybe they will come out with another freakin' hits album to suck the money out of us. However Alice still remains to be one of the most diverse and Imaginitive rock bands. I would recomend this to hardcore AIC junkies like myself only."
2,Record Company Cash In,"Let's face it, this an attempt to rip us off by releasing second-rate previously unreleased material alongside the classic AIC we all know. Music from the original albums and EP's: A. Sea of Sorrow Demo: A. Pre-Facelift Demos: F- (sounds like Guns N Roses). All Other Demos and Remixes: F. Positives: Picked the right songs to leave off the box from Facelift. Negatives: Didn't include the entire albums or EP's, Previously Unreleased material ( ). Conclusion: Get the original albums and be happy."
5,Music Bank Cashes In,"In short, Music Bank is the perfect collection of songs to display the talents of the most versatile band in modern rock. The four-CD set chronicles the best of AIC from the garage to MTV Unplugged, starting with some unreleased demos that would later lead to a record contract with Columbia Records. The demos are a bit lacking in recording quality, but the energy is still there. All the favorites are there too, like ""Would?,"" ""I Stay Away,"" ""What the Hell Have I?,"" and two different versions of ""Rooster."" There are also new mixes and demos of previously released songs, like ""Junkhead"" and ""Again,"" both of which add a new, pleasant flavor to those old favorites. The only brand-new track, ""Died,"" is a heavy, riff-driven song that proves that Alice In Chains can still rock with the best of them. This boxed set is a must-buy for any Alice In Chains fanatic."
4,"Great to buy, BUT.................","This may seem like a premature box set for this band,but it's worth listening to. The problem with this box set is lack of any real unreleased material/live tracks that it was PREVIOUSLY promoted for. I thought the addition of the cd-rom was useless and it would've benefited better with more music(or if they included a video a'la Metallica's Binge and Purge box set) There just wasn't enough unreleased material such as the demos that are missing!(HINT: check out an auction website for AiC's SUPER RARE DEMOS 1&2) I'd like to know why they ""edited"" out Ann Wilson's vocals on ""Brother""-it wasn't even mentioned in the liner notes! This is worth buying for any fan, but you may walk away disappointed!"
1,Very Dissapointed,2 out of 4 cd's dont play.. tried in other cd players and still not working..i would like to return the set
4,Husband LOVED it!,This was a gift for my husband who is a long-time Alice in Chains fan. He flipped when he saw this and has not stopped playing it! A must for any/all fans!!!
2,cd not available,"Cd was listed as available, I was notified that it would be late, waited, finally after 4 weeks I was told that item is not available. I did get refund credit."
5,Phenomenal,"Everyone in the world seemed to have heard about this book and movie, but I hadn't. I picked it up because the plot looked interesting and I like reading books from the male perspective. This book was outstanding. I can't pick a favorite story in here because I enjoyed them all. The plots were tight, the stories read easily, they were believable, and most importantly, the dialogue was fresh and sounded like real people. Not many people can merge all of these characteristics into one, but this lady sure did! (It's even better considering she pinpointed writing from the male perspective). I will be reading the rest of these books and watching the movie."
3,Tell It Like It Is,"I bought a hard copy of this book from our local community college's discard pile. This is my introduction to Gloria Naylor's work. The book is a series of portraits in story of black men, all of whom have some connection to a street in New York City, Brewster Place. My favorite was Abshu who teaches kids how to put people down in Shakespearian English rather than fight. That scene was hilarious. The story of Moreland Woods had some nice twists and turns. I think people enjoy watching the pompous fall. Naylor also did a good job in telling about Eugene who tries hard not to be gay, but ruins many lives with his refusal to know himself and tell it like it is. The book was an enjoyable reading experience, except maybe the part about Greasy, and that because it is sad and tragic. Enjoy!"
2,Naylor has bailed,"In The Women of Brewster Place, Etta Mae exclaims that ""All good men are either dead or waiting to be born."" The stories of The Two, Ceil, Mattie and the others proved this. There were no good men at Brewster Place, except maybe Ben, who ironically is killed. Now in The Men of Brewster Place, we find out that these men were really good men, in search of their manhood. This is a disappointment, Naylor seems to be softening in her age, and no longer feels the need to defend her women. These men did not need defending, in my mind they had no excuse for what they did. Brewster Place exists because of the women,their dreams, their community, not because of the men, who only beat them up or abandoned them."
1,A book of fragmented short stories that never come together.,"I anxiously awaited the publication of this book and was very disappointed with the contents. I expected too much. I expected the book to come together like the women of Brewster Place and it did not. I expected more from the characters -- they were hollow. I will, however, recommend that my book club, The Lorraine Hansberry Literary Circle, read the book because I want to know if I am the only person who feels this way."
1,The worst book ever,"This book is the worst book I have ever read. First I was confused why Basils mother died before he set things right, This was one of the main men I wanted to see set thing right with his mom. It gets worse, The book is very hard to read she jumps around alot from Ben, to other charcters. I had to force myself to read it and trust me my head still hurts. And the book is only 173 pages long. I wish I have never brought it this book goes off into space and I dont know what the she is talking about. Well trust me dont get this book,if you are looking for a good book to read."
4,The Men of Brewster Place,What a wonderful book! But not as good as The Women of Brewster Place. I can't wait to read my next Gloria Naylor book. :)
3,This book seemed out of time.,"I just finished THE MEN OF BREWSTER PLACE YESTERDAY and while I enjoyed some elements of the book, I was also left confused. 1st I saw the film THE WOMEN OF BREWSTER PLACE before I read the book. I seemed to me the film was set in the mid to late 1960s. The WOBP novel seemed to be set in that era as well. So with TMOBP I thought it would be set parallel to time of the prior novel, but it appears to be set in the future (mid 1980s w/some flashbacks) but sometimes it did not make sense. For ex. C.C. Baker appeared to be in his late teens in the first book and movie and he is still the same age in this book. If it was set in the 1980s he would be pushing forty years-old maybe. Also some references to crack,AIDS seem more contemporary and the name Hakim was very unusual if he was C.C.'s older stepbrother and the era was the 1960s. I just don't know. Overall the book was not great but it did not suck, I enjoyed TWOBP much,much more."
1,Disappointing,"I felt that Gloria Naylor dropped the ball for this book. There were brief glimpses of her remarkable writing style that had you captivated in The Women of Brewster Place and Linden Hills. But, somehow the flame never caught fire with ""Men"" and I felt as if I were reading detailed charcterizations. Nothing tied in together -- and the ending left you dangling dangerously. I think that the book would be a good example on how not to write a sequel."
1,Disappointing,"Men of Brewster's Place seemed very flat to me. I had a very hard time getting involved with the story or even caring about the characters. I thought Mama Day by Naylor was a phenominal book! When I read that book, I fell in love with Naylor's writing style, and I even enjoyed Bailey's Cafe and Women of Brewster's Place. When I compare Men of Brewster's Place with Mama Day, the two books seem to have been written by two different authors. Men of Brewster's Place does in no way show the wonderful writing talents of Naylor."
2,Men Of Brewster Place,"I must say that I was not pleased with this book. I was excited about reading it because TheWomen of Brewster Place is one of my favorite books. The only reason I continued to read the book was because of Eugene and Basil. I also found error in the time ti in compaison to The Women Of Brewster Place ( Eugene made a statement about Aids, However at that time it was still be refered to as Grid) However I will say that I you have read the first book, this book will clear up a few of the unanswered questions that you may have had after reading the first book. Even though Basil kept me reading the book, I still could not buy his reasoning for running out on his mother and then trying to make it right."
2,Disappointing,"A bunch of untalented folks got together and made a film. Annoying orchestral music on a noisy soundtrack accompany a boring high-school lesson about plate tectonics. There was nothing interesting or compelling... the narration was dull. The music was also uninspired, and as soon as the film began I heard hiss over my speakers. The picture seemed to flicker and there was noticeable dirt and occasional spots on the film, which really surprised me. We're supposed to be impressed by a few shots of mountains and oceans, with helicopter blades in many shots? There are more impressive pictures in the latest National Geographic magazine! This film perhaps would have been impressive in the 80s, but not today!"
2,THIS IS NOT A MUSIC VIDEO ABOUT THE GROUP GENESIS,This is an IMAX movie about the genesis of the world - NOT A MUSIC VIDEO. Don't be misled - I was!!
1,this is NOT the rock group GENESIS (gabriel collins..etc),"don't be mislead by the 1st reviewer, if you buy this you will receive an IMAX film described as follows: Using astounding cinematography, this blue ribbon American Film Festival winner becomes an adventure in history and geology, bringing to life the events that shaped the globe by exploring evolving continental drifts."
1,Helpful warning. It is not about Genesis rock band,"I had to rate the DVD just because it is the only way I can get my coment through. I do not watch it. Guess it is about the genesis of the world. I only want to give a piece of advice. Amazon is my favorite site. It is amazing how they track the customers in order to present new offers that each individual might like. But in this case, Amazon puts something that is confusing. In the ""Customers who bought this DVD also bought"" section they put Genesis-The Way We Walk Concert, some Pink Floyd's DVDs and other references of progressive rock. Amazon may mixed the info about what customers bought or the site gives such poor information about this DVD that make Genesis band fans buy something they do not want."
5,Chills down the spine,"Jimmy Oliver seduces, marries, insures and murders his wives. He is the ultimate con man, seducing and romancing before he marries, then changes into a monster afterwards. One of his previous wives who managed to escape him call his present wife, Sally, and tell her to get out while she can. Sally runs, but Jimmy is obsessed with finding her. What follows is a game of cat and mouse in which even the police cannot find Jimmy. Fast paced and extremely haunting, I couldn't put this one down until I had reached the end."
2,Nice but long intros,The children sing very nicely but the arrangements have long musical intros that are out of character with children's singing.
5,christmas gift,"this product was a christmas gift and i was worried it would not be delivered on time, but you were great, it got to me in plenty of time and has been a great product on top of that. i would definitely order from you again and again. thanks for making christmas buying so easy."
2,"Disappointing, few highlights","While there are interesting passages showing that Miles still performed at a high level, particularly early in this set, over production and poor writing destroy what could have been a memorable effort. The reuniting of Miles Davis with John McLaughlin is never given a chance to materialize. In fact, I dont think either hardly plays a note on ""Indigo"", a meandering piece. There is a bit of fire on ""Red"" but it is short lived. It is too bad Miles allowed his name to be attached to this misplaced effort."
1,I agree with the critic from CT,"This is a 'production', not a jazz alubum. Even though this music is interesting in it's own way, it's not the jazz that Miles would make, were this his effort. Disappointing would be the key word."
3,A cute and funny approach a little light on information,"I purchased this book for my husband after finding out we were expecting our first child. After reading the whole thing in about an hour, I didn't even bother to give it to my husband. It's a cute and fun read, but it's light on actual details and information. The book wasn't what I was looking for, but if you can't get your partner to read anything more serious or in-depth, this is probably a good bet to try and expose him to the ""guy's"" version of what's going to go on."
5,My husband loves! We now give to all our expectant father friends!,I picked up several books for my husband when we were expecting.. and this was the only one he read cover-to-cover (helps that it's super short).. and he loved it. Whenever he hears a friend is expecting he mentions this book to the 'dad-to-be'... we're handing these out to expectant dads this father's day.
1,Falls Short of Intelligence or Humor,"Somewhere in the introduction of this ""book""/pamphlet, the author mentions that he wanted to write a humorous and informative bit that, to paraphrase, could be read in the [the restroom]. He succeeded in the latter with 90 or so pages of text ... but unfortunately, fails to provide any intelligent information though does throw in a few amusing anecdotes and cartoons.Just because a man isn't familiar with pregnancies doesn't mean he's an idiot, although the author seems to be writing for that audience. Less fluff and more facts, written intelligently and humorously is what this book purports to be. Yet the authors' only credentials seem to be that his wife had a baby and she cut Hilary Clintons hair a few times. Let her write a book...I'm sure it'd be more interesting than this.Don't waste your time on this book."
1,One star for the ink and paper...,"This book is supposed to be funny, but frankly, it is not. Additionally, it falls into the typical cliches that men don't know anything about anything when it comes to pregnancies and babies, and that somehow they are emotionally or mentally challenged in these matters.But the worse part about this book, is not even its condescendence, but rather the complete lack of in-depth information the rare times it brings up subjects of interest. The book is like 12 pages long and is read in half an hour. It's like an expensive pamphlet. Don't waste your money!"
2,"ok, but...","This book is funny at times - I'll give it that, but it really has no useful information for a man whose partner is pregnant. My husband is not a reader, so I thought getting him a short, humorous book would ease him into reading about pregnancy. He did pick this one up, but found it was not worth the time, since there was nothing substantial in it."
2,not worth the price,"I bought this book with the hopes that I could learn a little, laugh a little and skip reading anything that had to do with a woman's experience - that's what my wife should be reading. I got what I was looking for with this book. However, shelling out $10 for a book that looks more like a hand out from the local clinic was not. Mr. Davis says not to fall for buying the most expensive ""baby"" related items as they are seldom worth the money - whoops, I already did buy buying this book. Save yourself the money, find the book at your local bookstore, buy a $2 cup of coffee, and breeze thru this ""book"" in 30 min or less. Don't worry about buying it - you won't look at it again after you read it once."
2,Not an useful book,"This book contains the personal experience of the writer. But if you like to know about the important aspects like Diet, cost, different procedures and the health of Mom during different months, this book is not for you. I purchased the kindle edition of this book and wasted $9.99. I then purchased ""The Expectant Father"" by Armin Brott which is a great book."
1,Save your money,"In a word - Garbage. Sorry. I guess on the plus side, it only took about an hour and a half to read. There was nothing helpful here."
4,Great gift for a Dad-to-be,My husband loved this light account of what the next nine months are going to be like. I read it also and it was very funny and had some very witty takes on all the crazy things that is pregnancy. Now it is in no way scientific and he states that. Its just meant to give you a quick primer into the world of your impending parenthood!
4,He Loved It!,"I bought this book for my husband to read. He has been more excited about the pregancy than I have (right now all I am is sick all the time). He loved this book to the point that he felt compelled to read parts of it out loud to me whether I was paying attention to him or not. The only down side is that the author breezes over things very quickly. It seemed to go from conception to birth very quickly, but it you what your man to actually read something informative and funny this is the book for you."
4,Funny book - he'll definitely read it,"My adorable husband is oh-so supportive of our first pregnancy but he definitely draws the line at reading the baby books. I got him this book based on one of the other recommendations and he has had a blast reading it. I would hear him laughing in the Dr's waiting room when he accompanied me on my OB visits and his presence was not required. He is already recommending it to friends that are ""trying"" and I'm sure it will get loaned out quite a bit. I have read it - it's a humorous look at pregnancy from the man's POV. I like the fact that it reinforces that we women may be a bit emotional and hormonal (so true) so give us exactly what we want and don't give us a hard time. :)"
1,At least it was cheap,"I bought this for my husband when I purchased the requisite What to Expect book for myself. (This is our first child and, by his account, he has never even held a baby.)I read the book in about 20 minutes (not hyperbole! it's really very short). It's devoid of any practical information and--as I should have guessed by the cover--is basically a joke... and a pretty bad one at that. I'm not just putting it down because it is useless in a practical fashion, it also isn't funny to boot.Poor man Amazoned his own daddy book, The Expectant Father (?), after I harrassed him about not reading the books I bought, I guess because he thought the lady pregnancy book would make him lactate or something. I've read a lot of it & it's pretty good. It doesn't have as much information as the mother-centric pregnancy books, but bc it's addressed to fathers (and all my books are addressed to mothers) it seems easier for him to read."
1,Waste of $10,"Look carefully at the details on this book before you buy. It's tiny. I mean, really tiny. Think ""Little Golden Books"" tiny. Don't waste your money on this - even as a new father gift. It's worth $3 at most. The text itself is mildly amusing, brief, and mostly accurate."
4,A Must for expecting Dads,"As many of the other reviews state, this is a must have for fathers to be. As an expecting father, waiting for my first child, this help me immensely with understanding what my girlfriend was going through, what to expect in the coming months, and how to deal with everything that is/will be happening. Also, I read this book in 2 very short sittings, so this book gets to the point, and fast. Again, highly recommended."
4,My boys can swim,"One of the funniest books I have read on pregnancy, is more about how not to upset your partner than what's happening in the pregnancy. Perfect for husbands."
4,My husband cracked up through the whole book!,"Now to be fair...I didn't read this book. My husband did. I thought the title was hilarious and had to get it for him. He laughed the entire way through and has been so sweet and kind to me throughout my whole first trimester (I'm twelve weeks along now). Every time I thank him for his patience and tell him what a great husband he is, he just says to remember that I feel that way in however many months it is until I deliver. I finally asked him if he got that from the book, and he admitted he had. Now my husband is a pretty sweet understanding guy to begin with...but if this book could make him crack up so much and perhaps understand my need for a trip to the grocery store for Cinnamon Toast Crunch (even after an offer to make french toast) at midnight I'd say it's a winner. I highly recommend it be bought for all husbands to enjoy while their wives stress out reading What to Expect."
1,Yeah right!!,"I bought this for my husband and in a pregnancy induced rage threw it away. I bought it because I thought the humor would be great and more relatable for him but I also thought it may have some good information. Boy was I wrong. I was flipping through it and got to a chapter on birthing and one of te first things it said is ""request the epidural right away."" Now, I get that this is intended to be funny but it can also lead those who are less informed to make a poor poor choice. It's not up to the husband to request the epidural and if she isn't in active labor, it can slow down the whole process and be a great disadvantage to your lady and your baby.Humor is great, but deliver it in a way that educates your readers and doesn't mislead them."
1,This book makes me sad for humanity,"I really do not know what to even say. This is worse than one of those stupid men's/women's magazines. I imagine anyone that would find this book useful would not care to read a book let alone know how to read a book.If a woman recommends this book to you, you should feel insulted."
5,Can't believe I actually read a book on pregnancy,"And I've never written a review on Amazon.com before. But when my wife gave this book to me, and told me that the author wrote it for the typical guy who ""won't spend more than four extended trips to the john reading about pregnancy,"" I thought I'd have a look. Truth be told, it took a bit longer for me to read than the author predicted, but it is a GREAT bathroom book. I kept reading a few pages at a time, which worked out perfectly since there really is something to laugh at on just about every page. No one is more cynical than I am about Lamaze classes, baby books and other general baby stuff, so it really surprised me that I not only read this entire book, but I actually enjoyed it...and even learned a few things in the process. So, if you're profile is ""anxious husband wanting to be helpful but no time or inclination spend hours reading hundreds of pages pregnancy material,"" this book is worth picking up."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"When I read the other reviews for this book I thought that this was the perfect book for me, a soon to be, first-time father. I even paid for express shipping because I was so excited. When it arrived, I tore open the package and was crestfallen just by looking at the book. It weighs in somewhere around ten pages (exaggeration) and is much more a humor book than a real life, honest to god, book for guys who want to know about what's going on in their wife's body and mind. Don't get me wrong, the author has a good sense of humor and the book would be good for one guy to buy another as a gift, but I found it dissapointing at best and unreadable at worst. In one sentence: It was not what I was expecting."
5,"Finally a book that is not sappy, wish it was longer!!!","We bought 3 books on pregnancy, and this was the only one that made us laugh out loud. We loved it! The illustrations were over the edge, which added to the humor. If looking for the perfect expectant father book, this it it! Quick read, Easy read, just plain funny."
2,"A bound, uneducated blog","There's not a lot of meat to this book. It's a quick read, but dads-to-be are not going to get much out of it. It's basically a blog--the author has simply written about his observations during his wife's pregnancy. It's strictly ""here's what happened with my wife ..."" and sometimes, but not always acknowledges that some traits are case-by-case. And how did his publisher get away with having him print things like ""I don't know why [xxx] happens ...?"" Do a bit of research and give the answer rather than go to print with admitted ignorance in a book that is supposed to give advice."
2,"Kind of funny, but mostly for men that don't like women.","I bought this for my husband, thinking it sounded like a light hearted guide for guys. It's not - it's pretty much one long anecdote about his wife's pregnancy. I can also sum up the whole thing in one sentence: ""Your wife will be fat, mean, and blame you for everything so tell her she's pretty and get out of the house."" My husband liked some parts, like to stay above the elbow during delivery since blood makes him pass out...but the rest was kind of insulting to both of us. This caters to a LOT of stereotypes that are pretty annoying. It also holds very little in the way of actual descriptions and conditions."
3,Funny but not all that informational,"This is a fun, short book to read but my husband did not find it all that informational. He enjoyed it for its sarcasism and it pointed out the basic realities of pregnancy but I ended up going back later to also get him a more informational book."
3,VERY SHORT-VERY SMALL,I bought this for my hubby early in my pregnancy. Hubby liked it and thought it was funny and I could tell he was happy reading something from the guy's perspective but compared to all of the encyclopedias I am stuck with this book is a pocket size book with funny (not mean) anecdotes and that is about it. I thought it would have a lot more info.
2,"Not a lot of advice, but a few laughs","I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book. While it had a few chuckles in it, the book didn't really give much in the way of quality advice or what to expect when your wife is expecting. I was more impressed with the books by Armin Brott."
5,You rock Ian !! (my husband's words),"Ian Davis is fantastic! This is the most hilarious pregnancy guide for men (and believe me- my husband has a few of them)- I bought it for him because I thought 'we're on our third-don't want him to adopt the been there, done that attitude' especially as he's one of those very involved men and takes it all so seriously. What a fresh take!! He loves it- we've even purchased them for friends who are expecting as well.Thanks Ian, it's a great book!!!"
2,Not worth your money or time spent reading it,"I bought this book for my husband thinking it would be a cute, funny read for him. It is funny in the beginning but overall ends up sounding sour and rude. The author doesn't seem to be very sensitive toward his own wife or the whole pregnancy experience. I think he tries too hard to be funny and comes off sounding like a jerk who doesn't really care. I have a very high tolerance for stupid humor but this book crosses the line. Save your money and buy something cute for your husband."
4,Perfect book for dads-to-be,My husband used to read books all the time. But now only has time for things about the length of a newspaper or magazine article. This book is really short and funny. So it keeps his attention enough to actually be informed as to what is going on. He reads a little at a time while things progress. And has laughed out-loud on a couple of occasions.
3,Good starting point,"Funny view on pregnancy, but not much useful/practical information. Worth buying - can read in one short sitting."
5,Outrageosly funny - a first time Dad must!,"I bought this book for my husband and didn't know what to expect. We read it together in bed in one sitting and died laughing. For the first time, my pregnancy became fun, and of interest to him. These hilarious tales actually are packed with useful information and insights. The illustrations are great. Makes a perfect shower gift for the pregnant guy."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"This brief little pregnancy memoir is amusing, but if you're looking for lots of useful information and a more in-depth narrative of the father-to-be experience, this book isn't worth purchasing.It's cute, it's good for a few chuckles---and it's going into our yard-sale pile. Not worth keeping."
1,The Author is not as funny as he thinks he is,I read it in about 2 hours. There is no real clinical information here. It is more of an autobiographical account of this guy having a kid. You can ask any of your friends about their pregnancy and get more insight.
2,Not as funny as billed,"I bought this book for my husband hoping he would find it funny and useful. Several reviews said something to the effect of ""if you like Howard Stern"" you'll like this. It turns out I'll have to re-evaluate my position on Mr. Stern. This book was hardly a laugh a minute. It was moderately entertaining and marginally useful."
1,Waste of money. Don't bother!,"I suppose this tiny book is meant to be a comic relief to more serious books, but it's not funny at all, unless maybe you're 12yrs old. Not funny, and it doesn't contain any helpful information. The author is a lobbyist for a fortune 500 company in Washington. Now I know what's wrong with Washington. If you want a book that has some humor but also lots of useful information, try the book ""Dad's Pregnant Too""."
2,Not very good,"This book wasn't particularly helpful. It didn't have much real, useful information, and it wasn't even that funny. It was readable, and a quick read (so you're not wasting TOO much time if you DO read it), but very light on real content."
1,Very Elementary,"It is funny if you happen to be a guy's guy and have strict gender roles. The jokes seemed like statements that have all been heard before. However, there was helpful information about the hospital experience and insurance from the Guy's perspective."
2,Husband thought it was funny....but reused jokes,"The jokes weren't original, and there was a serious lack of informative material in there...."
3,"Ok, but there's better books around","This book was a lot shorter than I was expecting. Considering there is absolutely nothing of substance written in the book, I should be surprised the author filled as many pages as he did.The book is ok for a quick read, say for example if you needed something to fill the time on a short train ride. I wouldn't recommend it however, if you are looking for any meaningful information.Having said that, my partner and I were prepared for a shallow read after reading some of the other reviews around for this book and were not looking for all the answers in this book. Rather, we were looking for a light-hearted take on pregnancy for men. We were bitterly disappointed. Obviously, we do not share the same type of sense of humour as this author."
1,very disappointing in actual knowledge passed on,"I bought this book for my husband because that was the exact quote he used when we found out we are expecting, ""My boys can swim!"" And while he's a HUGE Seinfeld fan, he was still not very amused by the annecdotes in this book. I read it, and found it completely devoid of any useful information for future dads, and couldn't BELIEVE the author was up until 5am writing, as he says at one point in the book. He gives about 2% real advice and 98% stories about his wife and annecdotes from other friends who have had kids, and devotes WAY too much time to telling you what NOT to name your baby, including a chart (a whopping 3 columns and 3 rows) of celebrities and their wacky baby names. Terrible book"
2,"Amusing, but falls flat","This annecdotal review of pregnancy from Dad's point of view is at times humorous, but often falls short of delivering either humor or information. If this book intended to be pure humor, it lacks the punch to really be funny. If this book intended to be informational to the father-to-be, it stops with one line where a page was due. In short, the book tries to do too many things in too short a space - and fails at all of them. It's an amusing read, but don't plan on the ""laugh out loud"" experience other reviewers have claimed. Set your expectations low, and you won't be disappointed."
1,Stupid,"I purchased this book for my husband, hoping for a funny, lighthearted, yet informative book on the challenges of pending fatherhood. The jokes are lame. My husband read the entire thing in about an hour and said, ""Well, that was stupid"". I was doubtful, so I also read it and agreed. The ""book"" is more of a booklet, and does not give much in the way of actual useful information. Mostly banter about moody mothers to be, but nearly nothing actually factual or helpful about the actual pregnancy itself written from a mans perspective, which was our intention."
1,For dumb dads,"This was a totally dumbed down book. My husband actually likes being a father and was insulted by this book. This is for a dad who likes to sit on the couch, drink beers, and not do stuff with his kids. Sorry book."
1,"Offensive, humorless and poorly written...but short","Like it claims, this is a book for men. That is, the worst of men. The ones who belittle women, mock foreign accents, make fun of children's names and, generally, are lucky to have gotten a woman in bed at all. If you're buying this to actually learn something, look elsewhere. If you're buying this because you're a guy who needs to look like he's reading a pregnancy book to pacify the little woman, you found it. To be sure, this book is horrifically offensive, extraordinarily self-indulgent and terribly written. A title like, ""The Red Neck's Guide to Pregnancy"" would be more apt. Fortunately, at one-sixteenth of an inch thick, it'll all be over quickly."
5,perfect for the manly man in your life:),"my hubby is not too into reading, but i ordered this book and left it in the bathroom for him. it's funny and hits all those points that i would want my hubby to read about from a man's perspective, and it saves him the trouble of having to read the huge pregnancy dictionaries i pick up:). it doesn't try too hard and is just a fun, quick read."
2,Dumb down version,"If you don't want to understand much about the pregnency, then this is a great book for your. It has very little detail and talks in very very general terms about things. If you like information i would strongly recommend another book that has much more detail.I was very disapponted and returned it after 1 hour of reading the book."
1,Don't waste your money!,This book is a waste of money! No useful information at all. This book is definitely less than I expected.
4,Good for Daddy's who don't really like to read about pregnancy,"I got this for my husband in The Army, who was away for the majority of my pregnancy. I got it for him because I seemed like an easy read and it is filled with humor. I thought it was funny and explained some of the behaviors of pregnant women in a light funny way. For example, it says that your wife will fall in love with her OB doctor and anything they said must be followed. In my case true.Your husband/Father to be won't learn a great deal of actual facts about pregnancy from this book, but he will laugh and maybe understand the pregnant woman in his life a little better, hopefully."
3,A pretty brief account,I was surprised by just how short this book was. I bought it for my husband and while he quite enjoyed it I think it was a bit lacking in any real information. I think it's more of a short comedy book than an actual guide to pregnancy.
4,"Hilariously Funny, Laugh out loud book","I bought this for my husband and I wanted to read a little bit to make sure it was the right book for him and I couldn't put it down. It has some funny stuff in it. He's very honest about things and I thought it would be very appropriate for my husband who's been wanting a baby for a couple years now. Totally funny, recommend it for any man who's about to have a baby or who wants one."
3,Very Honest Account,"Having been a cricket fan since the black & white days, I found Dickie's story to be most sincere in its writings, which in essence is how Dickie Bird ""ran"" the games for which he was in charge. A most interesting read for the diehard cricket fan, though don't expect a masterpiece."
1,Disappointed,"Great concept, but not useable. I live in Houston (granted there are LOTS of FM stations) and the interference from adjacent stations was too much for the little transmitter to handle.Also, the gain (volume) was not dependable and was usually too low for proper listening levels. Once again, that could have been from interference from adjacent stations.I talked to their technical support (super nice people) and tried it on two different vehicles. No luck on either vehicle.They let me return the item for full credit. Very nice people to deal with."
1,"Be careful, this is not compatible with Clix gen 2","I was looking forward to using this with my Clix Gen 2 player (4 GB), but did not read the specs carefully as the cable is not compatible with the standard mini USB plug on the Clix gen 2. The title is misleading, so hope you don't make the same mistake I made."
1,didn't last long,"Worked reasonably well for a while, as long as volume of mp3 was adjusted properly. Then began to get a high pitched, ever increasing whine and sudden static no matter what station, which car with an ipod nano. I've only had this device about 6 months. I emailed tech support from I river, advised to send in for warranty, no other suggestions made. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty."
2,iRiver AFT 200,"This device does not work for all portable media players, as initially advertised, it is specifically designed for the iRiver Clix. It will not work with the iRiver PMC."
4,useful setof essays,"Isn't it nice to have something on Perl that doesn't start at the beginning? Schwartz is one of the best known proponents of Perl and he offers expert advice in this book. It is a collation of what he regards as his best essays. These appeared over the last 10 years in columns he wrote for Web Techniques, Linux Magazine, Unix Review and Perl Journal.For Perl programmers, it's useful to have these essays in easy reach, as opposed to thumbing through your back copies of those magazines.The essays are grouped into broad categories. For those involved in web applications, you might turn to the chapters on CGI and on HTML and XML. Though I do wonder a little about the former choice. Nowadays, CGI tends to be deprecated, in favour of JSP or ASP approaches. Mainly because CGI coding turned out to be so dreadfully awkward. Granted, Perl helped mitigate some of this, but even so, the demand for Perl CGI scripts might have fallen since the 90s."
3,"Messy, even for an article book","It's not in my nature to like article compilation books and this one seems actually a little worse than usual to me. The content is all over the place and the formatting should have at least gone through some sort of standardization process. I find this kind of book very lazy. At the very least, be sure check the outline to make sure what's being covered matters to you before spending the money on this one."
5,Great help!,"Randal Schwartz is PERL. He is the PERL man.I know PERL very well, but even I learned a lot from this great book."
4,Great for tasting - break too easily,"The Riedel glasses are amonng the best, and these are just like the regular O tumblers. The only issue is that if you wash them with any vigor at all, you run the risk of the glass shattering in your hands ... not a big deal because you should really only wash the rims to remove lip marks and rinse the glass..."
4,On your mark........,"It's good music! Catchy, but well written. Every time I listen to it I get a new surprise in the writing. I hear a new drum combo I didn't hear the first time or a riff on the guitar that went unnoticed before. The lyrics are so honest and simple they make you laugh out loud. Like I said, just good music."
3,So You Ruined Your Life? Then reconsider buying this CD.,"There are a few memorable, catchy songs on this album; those that come to mind are ""Twenty One"" ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Go To The Mattress."" But even those start off strongly and fizzle out at the end. Some of the lyrics feel uninspired and the rest of the songs in this album haphazardly thrown together."
3,"Good recipes, yet complex, missing a few dishes","The book is good, there is a good variety of dishes, but not completely for the Korean palate. The first recipe I expected to see was at least dwenjang-cheegae, but it wasn't there...However, I've been using the book for more complex recipes, and it's been working out well."
4,A Literary Giant Waiting in the Wings,"Come Down Burning is a forceful drama that examines relationships through strong character metaphors and grippingly creative language. While Ms. Corthron's work is based in an African American community and is focused on such issues that affect African Americans, her art is so finely tuned that any individual may relate and benefit from either reading or seeing her work. Her language brings to mind Shakespeare and Langston Hughes. She is rythmic and unafraid to play with language to bring across deeper meanings while delighting the ears. Truly this play shows us an alter reality that gives insight into our own lives."
5,Great for RV Power Cord,"I use this bag to store a Conntek 14354 RV Power Cord, 50-Foot long, with RV 30 Amp Male Plug To 30 Amp Twist Lock Female Connctors. This is a heavy duty cable not a lightweight extension cord. The bag is very well made. Strong construction, good zipper and there's room for a few small extra items as well. I can strongly recommend this item as well as the smaller Bucket Boss ""Jumper Cable Bag"". I use the Jumper Cable Bag to store my 25 foot RV power cable. ( note: The Jumper Cable bag"" can also store a 25 ft white RV water hose like those sold at Camping World)"
5,Handy bag,This is a nice bag for jumper cables. you can store a few tools and a pair of gloves. almost anything to service a battery. that is what i use it for. that way im prepared for anything.
2,A nice bag but completely empty,"I was surprised when this arrived completely empty. I read the description as Cable and tool bag, thinking that I was getting cables and tools in a bag. No - just the bag. A bit overpriced for just a bag."
1,False advertising!!!,Miss leading title of product. The product does not come with jumper cables. Though it clearly states Cable and Tool Bag. The title should say Cable/tool Bag. They are advertising thieves...read the fine print I guess!!! Mother F'ers!!!
5,Another win for Bucket Boss,"As with all other Bucket Boss products I have owned, this one is excellent in construction. It holds a substantial amount of tools along with a set of 20' 2 gauge jumper cables. Replaced two bags in my truck, one for the cables and one for hand tools (full socket set in 1/4 and 3/8, collection of pliers and screwdrivers, etc.). I would highly recommend this product..."
3,"Very good, very well plotted. Good mystery.","Initially, I chose to read this mystery because I was in the mood for a good mystery and it was one of the shorter ones on my bookshelf; but as I got into it I found the author does a really nice job of telling a story. I'd recommend the book, especially as a read at bedtime."
3,Good Mystery,"The series could use ore dynamic character development between the main characters. It's interesting at first, but as the characters only threaten to change, but never do, after a while it get's dull. This book presents a new character, which is interesting in this book, but in later books he is just as frozen in what he is as the rest."
1,Help the Poor Struggler,"I had never read a Martha Grimes book before. She came highly recommended by an Englishman who claimed she could easily pass as an English mystery writer. I found the book disjointed, filled with shallow characters and had a very difficult time following the story line. Ms Grimes made fantastic leaps of logic, that were totally unbelieveable. If this is a representation of her writing, I do not understand her popularity."
5,Great product,I just bought one pack of these forrecord again my music collectionthat I had in discs of bad quality.
2,Looks great until you touch it.,"These cds are awesome...in theory. When you print on them, they look great. However, there are a few downsides. For starters, if you look close you will see print lines that run up and down the surface of the disc. Which isnt that big of a deal, but it prevents it from looking truly professional. My biggest complaint is the frustrating fact that when you rub your fingers a long the disc, it leaves smudges that arent removable. This is more noticeable with black ink. And you can forget about running a cleaning cloth or towel across the face of these discs. The results are obvious scratch marks that you cant remove. This is a huge downside for me and makes me want to get my cd's done professionally. I hate to give these cds such a bad review, but they are so limiting."
5,the last good cd as cd's are obsolete,". the few I have tried have been good .( I now do all my backups onto spare harddrivesinstead of cd's,I just use these for sharing data by snailmail ).. I was amazed it took so long to finda cd maker who got consistently good reviews;all the others are selling cd's cheaper to ussimply to avoid having to sort out defective ones .. on multiple sites, reviews have been goodonly for this brand ."
3,highlight low lights,"i order used books to keep the price down, which worked fine except that the prior owner of this book filled it with pink highlighter. it was very disorienting & annoying. i would not have bought this book if i had known it was full of pink highlighter."
1,Unimpressed,"Picked up the cd cuz I saw the video for Sun Shower on his other album and liked it. Kinda went off these reviews when I made the purchase, crossing my fingers and hoping for the best. Not one good track on the cd - his voice started to really get on my nerves as well (like lenny kravitz doing busta rhymes). First time I've bought a CD without hearing it first hand - do yourselves a favour and make sure you hear a few tracks before buying this one."
4,Good Resource,"I purchased this book as resource for I book I am writing. Since it is one of the ""Lifes and Times"" books by Neville Williams I knew it would be an excellent choice and I was not disappointed.The photos and biography were very helpful in representing the era and the index was invaluble."
1,Disappointing and not worth your time or money,"Seeking a name for your baby that reflects your Scots ancestry? This book does indeed list first names -- about 3 or 4 per PAGE, and you have to read through all the rambling gab to discover what the name means, or its history. Male and female names are mixed together rather than separated. As I've discovered, you are better off buying a Celtic baby name book that cuts to the chase and gives meanings and name variations according to gender."
4,"A little thin, but not bad","If you're looking for a reference book on Scottish names, this isn't the book for you. This book is more of a list of the most popular Scottish names that we all knew anyway. Not that that is horrible, but it isn't a reference book by any means. I will say that the book is laid out decently well (alphabetical order), but the male and female names are all mixed together, so, even though they are marked (m) and (f), it's still a little difficult to find a gender specific name."
3,Great for overhead projectors!,"This was not what I was looking for, but I will use the stories. I was looking for more information about levels and expectations. Double copies of stories in transparency form."
4,slow cook stew,"A treasure chest of gems and some filler. (Various ensembles from 1970-74)Disc I: 1) ""He loved him madly"" -wonderfully restrained and textured psychedelic jazz with the steady time keeping hands of Al Foster2) ""Maiysha"" - M.D. brilliantly clones Cameo/Sly in one fell swoop with bits & chunks of Axelrod trance bop/Esquivel moods. 3) ""Honky Tonk"" - Live Evil/B.Brew sound alike 4) ""Rated X"" -sorta interesting hard driving funk ala Stockhausen with Miles on organDisc II: 1) ""Calypso Frelimo""- Imagine early Weather Report with Miles as a guest 2) ""Red China Blues""-Rocking big band blues, great start, however, doesn't really go anywhere 3) ""Mtume"" - Delicious jazzy percussive driven parade, wild guitar from R.Lucas + P.Cosey 4) Billy Preston"" - similar to ""On the Corner"" era material. 24 bit remaster clear as a whistle."
5,Outstanding! The best book of its' kind!,"This book is a can't miss for beginning web designers. The author's simple, step-by-step writing style makes web development possible for the most novice web user.This book doesn't miss a thing. Filled with plenty of very explicit examples, Paul Meyers finds a way to bring a virtual instructor into your computer room.This is a can't miss for the novice web designer!"
5,. . . From This Day Forward,"Wonderful! ""To Have And To Hold"" is truly a wonderful book of love, romance, excitement, danger and suspense all tied in one. It is Solange's and Rupert's story. It is fiery hot -- H-O-T -- HOT, HOT, HOT!!! The pages are ""burning"" hot. Solange's dreams are at a peak in this book. After finding the ""man of her dreams"" in ""For Your Love"" she and Rupert are now preparing for another step in life, their marriage and to be bound forever together. However, they must get over the ""hurdle"" before the ""I Do's"" are said. After their adventures, will they spend the rest of their days in wedded bliss or will they forever be looking over their shoulders? ""To Have And To Hold"" is a rewarding story of love and trust. Ms. Sims not only reacquaint us with Toni Shaw and her family, but she kept all the excitement still going. Good book."
4,PERFECT ENDING TO A PERFECT LOVE STORY,"For those of you familiar with Rupert and Solange's somewhat unusual love story in past books as LOVE LETTERS, ALL THE RIGHT REASONS, A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE, and FOR YOUR LOVE, know not only did Janice Sims give us romance in each of these books, but suspense filled adventures.The final book, TO HAVE AND TO HOLD offers much of the same, but with a twist. Janice Sims gives us a look at a sensual, steamy (SIZZLIN HOT) side of her writing to the final chapters of Rupert and Solange's story. Introducing us to new characters, Danielle (Dani) and Sidney (which is another story), as well as revisiting some of our favorites, and plenty of suspense.TO HAVE AND TO HOLD is a wonderful ending to a perfect, somewhat unusual love story. I truly enjoyed every page, and hate that this is the last of Rupert and Solange. I recommend reading TO HAVE AND TO HOLD, and all the previous books.Good Job, Janice"
5,To Have and To Hold.......I DO!!!!,"It is rare that you find an author that keeps getting better & better with each book. Well, that is definitely the case with Ms. Janice Sims. I simply love this book. I love the way she builds her characters and stories all into one fantastic journey. Very few writers today take the time to actually use some creativity and use great writing skills to create books. But I give credit where credit is due and a true writer is what we have in the midst. All I can do is exhale and shake my head at the thought of what Ms. Janice Sims has up her sleeve to show us next. A job well done Ms. Sims..."
3,"Okay,...I'm feeling it!","Although I didn't read the previous editions, I really enjoyed the story. I don't necessarily agree with everyone elses reviews about it being so HOT and steamy. Those love scenes were decent, nothing to get excited about. But I loved the suspense, Ms Sims does keep you going. At least till the end. I felt like I was ripped off! I get to the last 5 pages and all kinds of stuff happens. It felt like it was rushed..so it doesn't match with the beginning of the story. I was very disappointed! Very...but all in all it was a great read."
3,Classic,"This mix is not just Liam Clancy singing his favorite songs, so for Liam Clancy fans this could come as a surprise. Also, it lacks the energy of his earlier recordings. By this, I only mean that it is pleasant to listen to but does not make you sing along"
5,"The ""manifesto"" of the Immortalist movement","This book, which I read when it was first published in 1964, a month before I graduated from college, literally changed my life, as it has the lives of thousands of people since. This is the seminal work of the immortalist movement. Indeed many leading cryobiologists and scientists in other fields today were inspired to become scientists by this book. The additional contributions by R. Michael Perry, also the author of a seminal work - FOREVER FOR ALL, and by Charles Tandy, a life long student of Immortalism, only add to the value of this updated edition.Peter H. Christiansen M.Div.Former Senior MinisterFirst Unitarian Church of Los AngelesMt Diablo (Walnut Creek CA) Unitarian Universalist Church"
5,Quite Possibly The Best All-Starr Lineup Ever,"This CD is delightfully energetic. ""Photograph"" is very upbeat, and the rest of the performances are played splendidly. Almost all of my Ringo favorites are here, including ""Don't Go Where The Road Don't Go,"" ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Back Off Boogaloo."" Notably missing: ""It Don't Come Easy."" But that one's on the DVD of the tour, so all is well. The All-Starr Band is also very strong. ""Give A Little Bit"" is a highlight. I have never seen Ringo live, but after hearing this and other releases, I hope he comes back soon!"
3,Good but not the best of The All Starrs,"Another entertaining release from Ringo and his then ASB lineup. Not as good as others though especially the first one which had the late great Levon Helm, Clarence Clemons Rick Danko on it. Good listening though and Ringo IS a great entertainer in his own right, so buy this with some confidence"
2,NO CERTIFICATE,"Although the product specifications state that the diamond is IGI certified, a certification does not come with the pendant! Very nice otherwise. Would have 4 stars if it had the certification. I will have it appraised to ensure the quality stated in the specifications is factual before the 30 day return period...just in case."
2,Purple + Violet?,"This book has a page for purple and a page for violet. That is silly and confusing. These are the colors I remember in the book: red, orange, yellow, blue, green, gray, black, white, purple, violet."
4,Rand T. Frantz,"I've had the Powermatic 25"" drum sander for about a month now. It replaced a Grizzley 24"" drum sander. It is a step up in quality and performance but also in price. I understand that Powermatic simply put their name on what was a Performax sander model. Both companies are owned by the same group along with Jet. The machine was accurate right out of the box. It performs nicely. I have to say though that the finish results using equivalent sandpaper grits is about the same as the Grizzly. The difference is the Powermatic is very heavy duty with nice fit and finish. It weighs in at about twice that of the Grizzly and doesn't complain when you inadvertantly try and sand a little too much in one pass, though that isn't recommended. I do recommend this machine highly but if you are a little more wealthy and have 3 phase electrical, go to a large belt sander. I don't have 3 phase or the other part right now so I am getting along quite well with the drum sander."
2,"Uh, ok.","My dog doesn't much care for it. With a lot of encouragement, he'll pick it up, then drop it again. He did, while it was turned off, chew off a couple of the bumps. Otherwise, while it's running, he has absolutely no interest at best, and runs away at worst."
3,Fun until he destroyed it,"My nine-month-old Australian Shepherd loved this toy so much that right now he's looking at the spot where I used to keep it and whining. The only problem is he quickly learned how to grab it by the nubs and carry it to a corner, where he methodically began chewing each of the nubs off. He was determined to do this once he discovered he could. We had some fun stuffing it in a paper bag -- at least it took him a bit to chew through the bag. We put it under a bowl too, but he lost interest in that. Eventually, he ate off all the nubs (I was careful to watch and remove each one so he didn't swallow it!) Then he cracked the plastic ball, and we had to say goodbye to this toy. I haven't decided if I will buy another or not. I'd like to find one in a hard rubber like Kong, etc. which he's not able to destroy."
2,"Pets go crazy, but chew it up fast","My dogs adore the Bumble Ball. They bark and growl at it and attack it while it's operating. But it's dumb for the company to warn you it's not a chew toy. Any dog who gets ahold of the toy (and they will) will chew on the rubbery knobs and chew them off, quickly. Even with constant supervision, we were unable to prevent them from biting off the knobs. A redesign with harder knobs (Nylabone-style) would be welcome."
2,Motor inside unit burned up after 30 minutes of use,"until the motor burned up my pet really seemed to enjoy sometimes was scared of the item. if the longevity of the item matched the price, i would like it much better."
1,Don't Buy!,My new Boxer puppy loved this Bumble Ball but it only worked for a week. I had a larger one years ago for another pet but I didn't have these problems with it. In fact it lasted for years. They will only refund once your return it. After paying postage I'd only net a few dollars. Not worth the trouble but I guess they know that.
2,Pet bumble ball,I got this and it broke shortly after getting it. I think I paid too much for it to have it brake that soon.
2,fun then broke,"Puppy had a good time for about 2 minutes, then it broke.... going to attempt to return it. Such a shame..."
4,Bumble Ball for puppy,"Bought this for my puppy since I remembered our dog playing with my daughter's bumble ball 20 years ago. Puppy loves it; I am not sure it has the same ""umph"" that the old one had, but it could be that I just don't accurately recall the last one."
1,Flimsy Pet Bumble Ball,"Unless you have a very mild mannered dog, this ball will fall apart after the first use of play!"
1,Crazy Pet Bumble Ball,This ball was a piece of junk. It didn't even last 5 minutes before the batteries were dead.
3,Great toy but my puppy didn't like it,"I bought this toy back in 2009 for my puppy. IT works great but the problem was my puppy was very scared of this ball. it's bit noisy. I would recommend this to a bigger dog, over 25lbs."
2,Bumble ball,"It quit working about 3 to 4 days after received. My dog enjoys playing ball with it, but he loved it before it quit. Can't recommend it to others."
1,Completely Fell Apart.,"I was pretty excited to give this toy to my 8 month old puppy. When she saw it she was terrified, excited, and it was hilarious. My high hopes were soon dashed when I realized that the vibrations from the toy caused it to turn itself off within 30 seconds of being put on the ground. I don't give up easily so I taped the switch down. The dog played with it for probably 1/2 an hour the first day. The next day I turned it on and it broke... just broke. I don't know why, but it seemed that the inner mechanism that made the ""bumbling"" happen just fell apart. I left the toy for my dog anyway figuring she might still be able to get some enjoyment out of it... about 10 minutes later she had chewed off a few of the nubs, and that was that. A whole 45 minutes of playing, a tennis ball would have been more effective."
1,Not a big dog toy,"I watched some videos of dogs having a good time with this toy. We have a Chocolate Labradoodle. He looked at it funny at first, then picked it up. The motor made a high pitch noise. I took it from him and it would not go back to normal. I turned it off and gave it back to him. He had torn to pieces in about 5 mins. This might be good for small dogs, but not big ones. The motor also went haywire within the first couple of minutes."
2,dog owner,"We bought this for our less aggessive chewer - Lakeland Terrier - unfortunately he showed very little interest in it and preferred a $2.00 ""head"" that squeeked when he bit into it. He liks the new toy smell of cheap rubber toys (although they don't last long)We tried to entice him to play with this toy but he barely noticed it. Our Welsh terrier found it a bit more interesting but being an aggressive chewer he immediately captured it and began to chew off the knobs.It was expensive to just sit in the toy basket.My mother's poodle was afraid of it. So we had one with no interest, one afraid and one who simply wanted to chew and destroy. Didn't work for any of our dogs."
1,4 Stars for Toy and Customer Service,"I notice that some folks do not explain if they purchased merchandise on line or in the store with they review. I bought this online from above retailer. Unpackaged it - DOES NOT WORK. Not a battery prob. Purely a motor problem. Enough said. DOES NOT WORK. Will not recommend this purchase online.New information regarding customer service since I was unable to edit the previous stars to 4: I called the company, they understood and immediately sent a working toy. They did not charge a re-shipping which was fair since the first toy did not work. Great customer service."
1,Get real.,"This is not a fair review as my dog has not met ""Crazy Pet Bumble Ball"".I have got to comment anyway. The statment not to let your dog chew onthe knobs assumes owners are going to take it away when the dog startschewing on the aforementioned knobs. They haven't met my dog. The first thing my dog would do is to chew the knobs off. I would not buy this formy dog."
2,Not for even mild chewers!,"Pros:1. Cool little toy that bounces around2. Grabs dog's attention3. Stimulates dog's mindCons:1. Dog was scared of it initially, she got past this after awhile.2. My dog is not a heavy chewer, but once the initial fear was gone she utterly destroyed this toy!Other Thoughts:Your mileage may vary, but for me this toy was pretty neat to start with, but my dog destroyed it quickly. I think she saw it as a threat as she doesn't usually chew her toys. If you have a chewer type dog I really don't recommend this!"
2,Alkaline vs Rechargable Alkaline vs Regular batteries Uhhh!,"Since the new changes in manufacturing them using ONLY Alkaline batteries, they no longer are reliable. They don't last as long as regular batteries and you cannot use them with rechargable Alkaline batteries. I had to buy a whole set of batteries, Alkalines. It is rediculous. I love the regular battery operating Crazy Balls Best."
1,Not for large dogs that like to chew,"Although it was very fun and cute to give to my 9 month old pit / lab mix, he had all the knobs and the yellow tab to pull for the on/off switch chewn off in the first hour. It seems to be his goal in life to destroy whatever toy you put in his reach.. and this did not stand up to his jaws. It was in the trash an hour later, but for a smaller , less anxious dog, this toy may keep him entertained for hours at a time"
1,Dog would have loved it,but it broke after one use. I thought it was battery related - so I replaced the batteries and the toy still didn't work. I tried the internal trigger to see if it was a contact problem - it appears to be an actual motor problem. Too bad - my 15 pound cocker spaniel would of enjoyed this toy. I don't think he was strong enough to break it on the first day.
4,Crazy pet bumble ball,"I bought the Bumble ball for our 16 pound dog for Christmas. I have no complaints about how the ball works or the quality of construction. But the dog only looks at it as a curiosity such as a cat looks at a gold fish in a fish bowl. The ball is hard and really has no good way for a small dog grab it. She prefers her stuffed toys and balls.I am glad I tried it, but the toy is better suited for a larger dog. Seems like a cat may enjoy it more but again the size may be a limitation."
3,Short Love Affair,"My Sheltie was so in love with this toy that when we would take it away from him, he remembered exactly where we would hide it and he'd try to coax us to give it back! The problem is that despite watching him carefully, he still chewed off a nub and it became garbage. But boy did he ever love it!"
3,This is actually a CHILD'S TOY not a dog toy.,"Although it is listed under a dog toy, I can see why it did not work out as planned for some people. My daughter had this as a 4-year old and it was a lot of fun for her to watch bounce around all by itself and try to catch it. It might be appropriate for smaller dogs who do not chew, it will not be durable enough for dogs who like to catch it and chew."
2,entertaining but not durable,"My Jack Russell loved the ball, in fact when I would take it out, even before I turned it on she would go crazy trying to get it away from me. It took her very little time to figure out how to ""catch"" the ball, then once she figured this out she chewed off the tips of all the soft plastic knobs. She had completely chewed off all of the knobs within a week. It was great for keeping her entertained but not worth the price."
1,Disappointed,"Thought it would be great, but actually scared my dog and when he got over his fear he was unable to get near enough to play with it.Needless to say he did not get enjoyment out of it.Can't recomend."
2,Puppy loved toy... did not last,"My 12 week old puppy LOVED the toy. However, it only last a couple of hours and she had the knobs off and it quit working. This toy would be perfect if it could hold up to rowdy puppy. It kept her busy until I had to take it away from her. I will put in the trash because the plastic knobs come off and she might swallow one. too bad it is not made very well. :("
1,NOT FOR DOGS!!!,"My Westie loved this, but had it torn to pieces in under 5 minutes - do not buy unless your dog only likes to lick toys!"
1,Broke almost immediately,The first day I used it for a few minutes; my puppy was intrigued with it but a bit concerned. The next day every time I turned it on and set it down it would only wiggle for 3-5 seconds and then come to a stop.
1,A very bad ball,"I was looking forward to receive this ball because i thought my seven months golden retriever was going to have so much fun, but as soon i took it out from box and turn the switch on, the ball did not do anything. I replaced batteries but it did not work anyway. I reviewed instruction set but it did not say anything helpful. Engine must be damaged. I finally decided to give the ball to my dog anyway but after just two minutes playing with it, one of the color pieces just pop up. I really will not recomend this product to anyone.The only good thing was delivery time."
3,Fun while it lasts,"My dog absolutely went crazy over this toy! Unfortunately, the fun didn't last too long. Considering the motor started to wear out after about ten minutes, I really didn't find the cost of the item worth the short amount of play time we received. It was fun while it lasted, but if I wanted ""hours"" of fun, apparently I'd have to buy one for every ten minutes I wanted to let my dog play with it."
5,BUMBLE BALL,the ball hops around with sounds which our dog likes. She thinks she is attacking a prey. This is our second BUMBLE BALL. This toy exercises your pet in a natural way. A very good value.
1,Lasted 8 Minutes!,"Okay, my corgis are pretty destructive. They are able to trash every toy I give them . . . But in 8 minutes?? They were digging at the ball and something inside became loose and it died. Since it didn't come with any instructions, I have no idea if it can be opened safely and what to look for. A complete waste of $$. Too bad as the boys LOVED it for those 8 minutes!"
1,Stopped working within 5 minutes,Terrible item. Not only did it stop working but our puppy took off one of the rubber pieces. Not safe at all
1,Toy for Kids not Dogs...Save your Cash.,"My 6th month old greyhound/beagle mix enjoyed this for about 5 minutes...then the caps inside the nub fell into the center of the ball causing the motor to cease functioning. After getting the ""eyes"" from my sad puppy I hauled out the screwdriver, dismantled the toy and rigged it to work again. That is until he picked the toy up by one of the nubs and the inner cap came off...again. This is a child's toy, it is not meant for dogs...also note while the photo shows the text on the ball to be ""Crazy Dog Bumble Ball"" mine simply came with the words ""Bumble Ball"" on it. Making me think this company is just selling a child's toy as a pet toy. Not good considering the hazards that could occur when a dog plays with this ball. Check out the babble ball instead...at least that is an actual pet toy."
2,This is considered a dog toy?,"When I first started this thing up I thought our Boston Terrier was going to like it, he jumped with excitement, until it keep hitting him in the noise and mouth every time he tried to pick it up. Then I found how it holds up to our small, 25 or less pound B.T., once I truned it off and laid it on the floor he took it. Less than 5 minutes he chewed one of the colored feet off and the gray piece inside, that I could see inside the ball, and also he had another foot chewed almost all the way through. So... I threw it out. This is not a dog toy. Dogs chew things. If you can not trust a toy with your dog for less than five minutes without getting something caught in their throat, it is not a safe toy. If you decide to get one of these, make sure you supervise, and do not allow your dog to chew on it. You would be better to give this to a cat that does not chew things up. Unless your dog is old and toothless, give it to a toddler like it was intended."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I had this bumble ball for all of 1 day and it quit working. I pushed in the button to start it and nothing happened. Then I couldn't pull the button back out! I am thinking for 15 bucks it should have worked for at least a couple of days! This was worthless, now my dog just stares at it."
1,Just got it,"I just received this in the mail. Turned it on and my dog loved it. He chased it and picked it up, dropped it on the CARPET and it stopped working! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"
4,Hilarious,"My dog goes nuts when I turn it on... Can't tell if he's scared or not, but either way, it's good for a laugh!"
1,SHORT LIVED,"I had bought a similar ""ball"" for my neighbor's large Great Dane/ Lab mix a couple of years ago -it was great fun watching her try to catch it! I bought this toy for my daughter's 1 year old, medium sized, mixed breed for Christmas. She was not frightened of it in the least. We thought she may be, because she is a bit of a scaredy cat! To our surprise she immediately went after it with much enthusiasm. But the fun was VERY short lived. The ""ball"" did not ""bounce"" in unexpected directions as we had expected, but instead sort of rolled and rocked rather slowly making it easily and quickly caught. In less then 10 minutes of play she had bit one of the ""studs"" and broke it, so now it won't work at all. I would search around for a different ""ball"" then this one, it doesn't appear to really be made for dogs."
2,Not for large dogs,"When I first got this, I was surprised at it's small size. I was expecting a larger toy, like the one used for children. My dog is a Great Dane, and he can easily fit this in his mouth. I wanted something that he would chase around, but he just grabs it and gnaws on it. Yesterday he chewed one of the knobs right off, and he could have easily choked on it if I wasn't supervising him. I'm thinking about getting the regular kid sized one, which should be harder for him to sink his teeth into.I think it would be a fun toy for a small dog to chase around, but if you have a large dog, I would look for something different."
4,My dog loves it!,"tHIS IS ONE OF MY DOGS FAVORITE TOYS. hE BRINGS IT OVER TO BE TUNRED ON AND TURNS IT OFF WHEN HE'S DONE! IT IS NOISY AND IS NOT A CHEW TOY (YOU HAVE TO WATCH BECUASE THEY CAN POP OFF THE NUBS), BUT HE HAS SO MUCH FUN WITH IT. THE ONES I'VE HAD IN THE PAST CAN USE UP BATTERIES FAIRLY FAST. ALL THAT BEING SAID, I ORDERED 4 TO MAKE SURE MY FOUR LEGGED FRIEND DOESN'T HAVE TO GO WITHOUT!"
4,A classic for a reason,"If you wish to truly understand the general theory of relativity this is the place to start. It's treatment is old and hold nothing on the likes of Wald, but it ties in well with conventional mathematical methods and with this you can go onto more elegant and modern formalisms which miss a lot of the basics in this text. If you have background in tensor calculus and special relativity this may be a good starting point, if your knowledge however is above or below that level you may find the text a letdown."
3,Not as good as they would have you believe,"Virtually everyone who works or who worked or who would like to work in GR brags up this book and boasts of reading it from cover to cover. Most have not. I, unfortunately, have. It rambles and is scatterbrained and halfa* on many topics. The would be investigator would be better off following another course of study in differential topology and differential geometry, almost any other relativity text or texts, and the literature. It should be kept in mind, however, that when this book was first published the global methods were like lie algebra was at one time - researchers writing papers for and to each other with nobody else in mind. This was a supposed attempt to make the material available to a wider audience. It may have degenerated into intellectual onanism."
5,Best Book Covering General Relativity,This is the best book available describing Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. In contrast to other books on the subject this one is an easy read.
3,Someone Please Write A Companion Problem Book w/ Solutions,"Sure this book is great, but what it really needs for self-study is a two volume companion book which lists all of the exercises with detailed solutions. Similar to the way _Problems in Real Analysis: A Workbook with Solutions_ by Charalambos D. Aliprantis is the companion book for the real analysis textbook _Principles of Real Analysis_ by the same author. There is a problem book for general relativity with solutions, but its approach is so different from that of _Gravitation_, that it is pretty useless as a companion book."
1,I thought this book was awful!,"I am a retired EE professor, interested in learning something about general relativity in order to apply it to the foundations of electromagnetic field theory.Frankly, this book reads like a series of powerpoint slides in a presentation in support of a grant application.There is very little of rigor here. The basic concept of a tensor is given a very glossy treatment. ""A tensor is a machine that accepts a vector here, and a one-form there, and grinds out---""I have no problem with colorful language, but these authors never really progress beyond that, treating their topic without any semblance of rigor in a mathematical sense.I felt that my dollars spent on this book were wasted."
2,Authoritative but a little patronizing,"Resorting to the metaphor of ""bongs of a bell"" to describe differential forms and ""machines"" to introduce the notion of tensors is a little insulting to capable undergraduate physics students. This is one of the most overhyped and overrated textbooks I've ever used.Physics and math students: Brush up on your vector calculus and classical mechanics and start with Shutz's ""A First Course in General Relativity"". If you've had some general relativity already, head for Wald's ""General Relativity""."
4,"Beautifully crafted light songs, exquisitely performed","This is another Collins recording resurrected by Naxos, and deservedly so. Most of the selections on this CD are either childrens' verses or humorous verse, but Lehmann (as a former world-class singer) knew how to write a darned good vocal line and get the most out of a text. There is nothing profound here, nor is there intended to be, but it's good music and the performances here are top notch."
1,Save $5 - get item #06009 instead,"This item is identical to the Bucket Boss Brand 06009 Jumper Cable and Extension Cord Bag which is $5 cheaper at $14.99. I bought both because I wanted a bigger and smaller bag and assumed that this item was, indeed, bigger but it was not. This item is marked ""big"" where the other is not and is $5 more than item #06009 so I was surprised when they arrived and were IDENTICAL (not similar but exactly the same). After a couple of complaining emails I was given a refund of $5 for each of the 2 of this item I bought.In short, save $5, get the Bucket Boss Brand 06009 Jumper Cable and Extension Cord Bag instead!"
2,"A lot of theory, few specific tools","I picked this book up after reading an article about Loehr's program in Outside Magazine. Unfortunately, the article had more specific, day-to-day advice than this book does. Loehr's ideas are very interesting and ring true, but he spends a great deal of time justifying his theory and reviewing brain biochemistry and physiology experiments. Then he throws in some case studies and some vague recommendations - eat multiple small meals a day, target your heart rate during exercise, reframe your inner dialogue, etc. Based on the magazine article, I was expecting a program to help you identify your weaknesses when it comes to implementing these changes and structure a program around that. I was expecting a realistic look at why people fail to become tough and how to work around it. The book starts to do that, but never really follows through with specifics."
4,good chant CD,"I enjoyed this CD a good deal; I've been known to hum the chant to Shiva at various points in the day. The instrumentation isn't artificial and goes well with the chants, and many of the tunes are catchy. I also enjoy Kate's voice."
1,Stop the Presses!,I buy red 5 gallon buckets w/ lids from Firehouse Subs all the time for $2.00. They may smell like pickles but you can't beat the price!!
3,And then you get the bucket,I wish I would've known that when I ordered the Bucket Boss organizer that it didn't come with the bucket! I learned the hard way. Not that there's anything wrong with this bucket...just thought I'd share my frustrations!
2,Doesn't fit Bucket Organizer,"I bought this and the BucketBoss Extreme Gear 01064 Fatback Bucket Organizer. The bucket is fine, but it doesn't fit the organizer! How strange, since this is a ""Bucket Boss"" brand bucket.Richard McGrath[...]"
3,Why didn't they embed the Bucket Grip?,Seems like a logical thing to do. Bucket Boss probably had some company make the buckets for them. Why in the world wouldn't they ask the company to change the generic handle to be a nice wide one like their Bucket Grip? Then it'd be a no brainer to get this and they can even charge a buck or two more...
5,Does what a bucket is supposed to do!,"Really not very much to say about a bucket.... the Bucket Boss brand organizer fits perfectly over it. Clean, strong and waiting to be used!"
1,Why isn't it available?,"Last month a ""special"" deal was available. Buy a bucket organizer and get the bucket for free. This purchase took place at the beginning of December 05. I was received the bucket organizer a month ago. I was informed that the bucket was back-ordered approx. 1 week. Just the other day I was told that the bucket is back-ordered 3-4 months, yet the site claims that it will be shipped in a couple of business days. What's up with that? If you pay for the bucket, you get it quicker? If it's free, you need to wait till March or April?"
1,GRIZZLY WANT SUCKERS AND STUPID BUYERS!!!!!!,The price of this item is for suckers. $7.95 + 8.20 (shipping) = $16.15I walk into Lowes and My 5-gallon bucket that I paid $16.15 for is selling for $4.98. It proves there is a sucker born every minute and I was that sucker. AND GRIZZLY COURTESY OR AMAZON IS LOOKING FOR SUCKERS.
5,An eye-opener for women!,"I enjoyed reading the book. It offers a lot of valuable insights about relationships and men, how to recognize the wrong men and how to find the right men. The authors clearly explain why women seem to be falling for the wrong men and why these wrong men seem to be so attractive and exciting"
1,there are no solutions here,"The book starts out okay, talking about games and insecurities and poor outcomes, but then goes on to advocate manipulation. Robin Norwood's books help a lot of people; this one doesn't come close. I bought it for my daughter; she didn't like it either."
2,Smart Women Read Other Books,"While I thought the personal assessment exercises in the back of the book were very helpful, I felt that the book as a whole was biased. The book suggests that women set lower standards in order to find the man of their dreams. The book also diminishes the mother's crucial role in raising children and implies that the decision to have children lies solely with the woman.I felt that the book was contradictory. On one hand, it tells women the type of men to avoid and what type of woman is most desirable to men. On the other hand, it says that the smart woman who has learned from her past mistakes ""may have served to narrow her vision and opportunities."" Perhaps smart women are too much of a challenge for a real man."
1,No good enough,This book do not provide women with enough incentive to drop off the bag of bad choices. I bought it for my daughter. She did not like the book.
5,Great Golden Batman Book,"This is another Great Golden Batman Book. Start your clocks and count down the minutes as Batman and Robin rush to save Batgirl from a horrific death at the hands of Mr. Freeze. However, there is more than meets the eye than just a great adventure. The elements of humanity are heartbreaking. The read is an easy one and the drawings are very good. It is a great companion to the direct-to-video movie."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I picked up this book hoping I could get a quirky novel, and add some mystery all the better. I thought it would be similar to Christopher Moore's books, like the ""Island of the Sequined love nun"", but it wasn't. I read through about three chapters, with an open mind, but it wasn't the weirdness that was a problem, the book was simply boring. It didn't even seem that weird.I stopped reading, skimmed through the pages to see when Vishnu was going to make an appearance, and it wasn't for a bunch more chapters later. My time is important, so I put the book down.So you can guage my judgement, I like authors such as:* Christopher Moore* Terry Pratchett* Jonathan StroudThe cover looks awesome though."
1,It never goes anywhere,"I was really excited to read this book after reading some good reviews for it. The first couple of chapters were entertaining and intriguing, yet after a while it just seemed like the book was going around in circles. The lead character, Travis Anderson, is not a character I could connect to. His holier-than-thou attitude made it hard to care about his plight. If it wasn't for my creed to always finish a book I start, I would have put this one down."
3,A pretty good novel (Sort Of),"I'm surprised at how many 5 stars this book received. I found it generally entertaining, but contrived to the point of being distracting. I liked the basic premise of the book, but I think the story fell a bit short. Other authors I suggest are Will Christopher Baer, Craig Clevenger, and Chuck Palahniuk to name a few."
1,Stupid Book,"Aside from the few (very few) likable passages this book was a chore to get through. The characters are all unlikable and superficial. The plot is meandering. It insults one of the oldest and most peaceful religions on the planet. Basically it sucks. Don't waste your time or $ reading this. Go to a library if you (for some ungodly, sado-masocistic reason) must read it."
5,Loved This!,"Will Clarke is a wonderful writer! This book was somewhat ""stream of consciousness"" but it is exactly how most of us think. This book was funny and deep. The themes are those that all of us face in daily life. Definitely recommend to others!"
3,One of the quirkiest stories I've ever read,"The cover and title drew me, but I was hooked by the second paragraph. Clarke's humor is all over every scene. It keeps the story from melding into meladrama. Travis is a type of yuppie everyman who has an unlikely psychic ability that is first a curse then a gift and finally the very thing that enables him to save the world."
2,Crashed half way through,"This book started out pretty good in the beginning, then it just sort of veered off track and got pretty goofy. Not what I was exspecting. I understand it's fiction, but it was just too goofy for my taste. The charactars weren't likeable. The wife sounded like a wench, I was actually kind of hoping he wouldnt try to save her."
2,Needed more revision,"The prose had problems. Example from page 200 of paperback version: ""Please!"" I beg.When you say please, the begging is sort of understood. Some characters had tiger-like grins or bank teller smiles--not as cliche' as wolf-like grin but its in the same ball park.I do hand it to the author, he has a great premise, thus the 2 stars. But I think the novel needed a little more polish. The problems were very distracting to me, and I could not get any momentum from this book."
3,Good but expensive,"This is a great product for gifts and for people who want a new addition to their collection. But, when compared with the transparent glass, it's twice the price which makes it pricy."
5,I couldn't put it down.,"This is a book that I could not put down for a day! Then a month or so later after I read it, I had to read it again. Must read for anyone at all interested in Star Wars."
3,"Fascinating read, but...","...you need to take the entire book with a grain of salt because it was riddled with obvious factual errors. The only one I recall off the top of my head is that the author goofed on the year Empire Strikes Back was released. It may sound minor, but there are enough of these errors that you are left wondering what else in the book might be wrong.However, it's a hard book to put down if you like Star Wars."
5,My Most Favorite Miles CD,"I have dozens of Miles Davis' CDs including those from the two ""great quintet"" periods (one with Coltrane, the other with Shorter). This live set doesn't belong to any of them. However, I confess this is my most favorite of all. Miles is jumpy and inventive. Mobley is soulful and beautifully relaxed. The rhythm section is tight and full of spices. I enjoyed this Blackhawk live (both CDs) even more than Kind of Blue or 'Round Midnight. Listen without prejudice and it will bring a smile on your face."
4,great cameras,Love them they were a big hit at the reception. The designs were beautiful and went along great with the theme of the wedding.
5,Very strong green tea extract,"Read the review by HTBK - I did and decided to purchase and have not been disappointed. I've never noticed a green tea supplement before, but after taking this I feel like I'm on fire. Not in a bad way...my body temp just increases and it makes me feel like the air conditioning is turned off. There is no caffeine in this supplement so you don't get jittery (at least I don't). This brand is strong and when I compared it to the Natrol brand I was taking, I realized I would have to take 4 capsules to equal one capsule of the ProHealth version. That would have been a lot of caffeine. I recommend the product and the seller."
4,A fun project,"I'm an artist naturally, and only bought this as a ""thumb-twiddler"" for winter confinement. I was pleased with the quality of the paints however the artist board could be a little better quality. over all the picture turned out great, mostly because I only followed the basic outlines and colors. The rest I painted freehand with many many improvements. It would be good for someone that can't paint and enjoys tiny detailing. you will also need a smaller brush than the one they include in the kit."
5,Darn That Dream Heaven!,"this is a great recording. Charlie Rouse was Monk's tenor player, yet I'd say to most, he is relatively unknown; most casual listeners would now know him.and he is fabulous, with taste and tone and technique.I've been on a Red Rodney craze lately, having just discovered him. He is tops on the trumpet, whether from his days with Charlie Parker, fifties recordings w Ira Sullivan or his comeback from the seventies through the nineties.this just jumps out at you from the get go, right out of the gate; they're smokin' on Little Chico. Charlie Rouse wrote it; it's a Bird type of head. It has some shifts in tempo, kind of post-bop-ish, but this creates tension that breaks beautifully into straight ahead, hard swingin' bop.I have come to love Darn That Dream; it has become a real favorite of mine.I was in heaven to discover two great takes on it here.this is a gem, a terrific find, a score, a buried treasure...man, these cats can blow!"
1,"trash, trash, trash and more trash","Where do I begin, the radio did not work, the USB did not work, the 110 volt outlet did not work. the crank light did not work. I took the unit to a dealer that is a part of the Vector company. They said It was trash and had several in the back that had been returned, and they were trash. You will be returning this unit if you buy It. *****Warning***** Find the nearest trash dumpster and trash It or get your money back."
2,Doesn't hold a charge longer than one day,"I JUST realized the other day when power went out that this does not hold a charge longer than a day. My previous Storm Center held a decent charge for a good month, then I'd recharge it. This one apparently needs to constantly be plugged in which is odd, as an electrician, I deal with batteries and batteries are supposed to hold a charge. So I guess the power company needs to call me the day before they lose power again so I can plug this in to be ready."
1,Simply worthless.,"If this text had not been assigned, there is no way I would have finished it. Lindbeck formulates the most tenuous arguments and treats them as if they are iron clad, he in the end doesn't really come to any solid conclusions. Simply horrible. As if Lindbeck's unbelievable ego wasn't bad enough the vocabulary is above all but Webster. I'm a masters student in theology, and I had to sit with a dictionary to make it all the way though."
2,"Misleading description, horrible quality","The description for this video was very misleading. It led one to believe that Nancy Kerrigan was skating along with others. It also implied that the video was shot in Las Vegas. In fact, it was shot at a planned community in Henderson, NV.The video quality was awful. The camera often found itself behind blind spots, and the lighting and angles were very poor. The ice surface on which performers appeared was ridiculously small.There were teasers showing a group of child skaters, but the actual sequence never appeared.The only saving grace (and the only reason for a second star) is that some of the actual performances were excellent."
3,Need more bass!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased these along with the matching separates for my 2009 Honda Civic LX. They were very good above 120Hz, but worthless below 100Hz. A subwoofer is a must and matching it acoustically was a nightmare - music never sounded like it should. Either the sub was too bright, or the tweeter output needed to be modulated. I only wish these speakers had been able to produce decent mid-bass. I will be looking at the BA SR65 to replace the Alpine."
2,"Thin sound, little mid-range, no bass","I bought these Alpine's to replace a pair of old car speakers that I had placed in an enclosure and used in a spare room of my house. The old speakers sounded good, but time and weather had done in the cone of one of them. I looked over the offerings in 6"" & 6x9"" speakers and chose these, largely from their reputation. What a disappointment. The sound was thin, with almost no bass and little mid-range. There was absolutely no ""fullness"" in their sound. There was no comparison between the performance of the old 6x9 3-ways and these Alpines. As component in a multi-speaker system, they would probably do well, but they will not stand on their own."
1,Wrong speakers,I actually received the spr-60 set and didn't realize until after a long install that I did order the better 17c set and was very disappointed.
5,Great product. You just can not know what they will sound like without an amp!,Great price for one of the best speakers that alpine ever made. Why did they ever discontinue the good stuff?
4,Not $30 Better Than Sony XS-GTX1641,"Let me start off by saying these are great speakers. Clear sound and adequate bass response. The ONLY reason I'm giving these 4 stars are because to my unsophisticated ear, these are not much better than the Sony XS-GTX1641 6.5"" speakers. I recently installed both the Sonys and these Alpines, and while the Alpines provide slightly more bass, I would have been just as happy installing 4 Sonys for $30 less. But if you do have a more sophisticated ear than I, then maybe you will be able to greater distinguish between these two sets of speakers. If I didn't have the Sonys to compare them to, I would have given these 5 stars because for the price; they did provide the sound I was looking for."
1,OK but nothing more,"This is an annoying CD, with acceptable singing but extraneous bird chirps as background inserted on every track for no apparent reason. In addition, the musical accompaniment is thin, consisting of MIDI arrangements rather than real instruments. Perhaps good as a way of teaching some basic villancicos, but musically unsatisfying."
5,Igual al que escuchaba en mi niñez,"Este album lo considero excelente, aunque digan quizas que musicalmente es pobre, sinceramente para mi significa mucho porque creci oyendo estos villancicos toda mi niñez y adolescencia y significa mucho poder escucharlos Navidad tras Navidad. Los recomiendo mucho especialmente si quieres recrear una Navidad bien latina!"
5,I love it,"This CD is excellent, I have also Vol.2. Both make an excellent purchase. Kids and adults love this traditional Colombian villancicos. This music brings tons of good memories."
5,Nostalgias y recuerdos,Este excelente disco nos trae a la memoria todos aquellos villancicos que oimos de niños frente al pesebre. Las voces infantiles lo hacen aún más auténtico.
3,voyeuristic exploration of degradation of young men by old women,"The performance by the young actor Kostja Ullman made the movie worth watching, but I really didn't find this rest of the movie worth the effort. This is a intriguing but not compelling movie that is sort of weird in the way some European movies are.. The idea of a sadomasochistic affair between a 50 year old women and a 16 year old boy as beautiful as the actor, Kostja Ullman was unbelievable to me, despite the excellent performances by the main actors. Check out Ullman in the movie, Summer Storm, but skip this movie unless you are into beautiful boys or voyeuristic explorations of degradation of young men by old women or maybe weird European movies."
3,Punish Me,"Lead actor ( though young ) proves he is goodother reviews allowed to NUDITY. there is non by any party in filmstory is good, but strained. you can enjoy"
2,audio book...,"The reader is ever bit as important as the subject matter in an audio book. This reader was sub standard. Although he had a clear voice, his inability to adapt to the changing characters made him a poor choice. The short stories were O.K.. The man chosen to read the story was not!!!!"
5,Why Did I Wait So Long?,"I am ashamed to admit that this is the first time I ever read anything by Louis L'Amour. I like short stories, so when I saw this for $3 in a cut-rate shop, I figured, ""What the heck."" I am halfway through and already looking for the next volume so it is at hand when I finish that one. If you are a short story fan, buy the book. It is fabulous. If you are a writer of short stories looking for good examples, buy the book. These stories are very well written. He makes you care about the characters immediately. So much so that I am aften sad that the story is through. I want to read more about these folks! Anyway, I love it."
3,half of this is'nt funk,"I love funk and this is just somebody throwing pop hits togethrer trying to cash in give it 3 stars only cause there's some fine sisters on here sorry but shakira, and christina aguilera is'nt funk."
5,Works Great cant find in local stores,"I do a lot of Unistrut, threaded rod, and anchoring into concrete with my job. These work great to hold all the various nuts and washers and anchors. There are six pockets. Fully loaded (and balanced with a little bit of thought with respect to how you load it) with lead anchors and drop-in anchors the strap in the middle does a great job of lifting the bag level without spilling any of the contents. I imagine 4 or more of these could fit in a 5 gallon bucket. It cinches shut with a rain jacket style para-cord plastic button cinch."
5,door guy,I love these bags They never spill screws the only problem is that every one that sees them wants one and I need to keep my eyes on mine
1,Bogus Reviews...,"I am sure this is a fine product but after reading all the reviews its obvious that most, if not all of them were written by the same person. Consumers aren't stupid. If you are going to write a bunch of bogus reviews you have to change your style of writing, your Grammar, and your opinion just slightly enough to make it believable. I see this a lot with reviews. Reviews are not advertising, please don't cheapen a good thing."
4,High quality useful item,"I have several of these for holding screws and other hardware. One is just for drywall screws of different lengths (which I wrote on the outside of the bag). I can put 10-20 pounds of screws in the bag, and it still fits into a 5 gallon bucket. I can do the same with a bag of outdoor (coated) screws, and another for pneumatic nails, brads and staples, and a final bag for nails.When I go to a job, I just put the bucket in the back of the truck and I know I have all the hardware I'll likely need. When I'm in the shop, I just keep the bag on my desk/bench.The only negative is that the nylon is a little thin, and I don't think they'll last as long as if it were canvas or a thicker nylon."
5,Great bags,"I was not expecting much, but am impressed with how useful and durable these things are. Especially considering the price.Different drywall screws in one, exterior screws in another, tapcon and other anchors in another. I love these bags.Update - As of April 2012, almost two years later, these bags are still holding up. No tear or broken string ties. Highly recommend over the yellow plastic bucket trays."
4,Another in waiting,"I too have had the series for years, and have always wished to know if Wandor ever gained the fifth crown. Also can understand why it wasn't finished, but do regret that it was not. Do you suppose I would have forgotten about it if I had known the ending?"
3,Bucket handle,"Handle fits easily over the plastic handle of a Home Depot bucket, BUT it slides around and can easily fall off. A tighter fit would be better"
5,Almost perfect so far!,"My husband is thrilled with his bucket boss! He's wanted one for a long time and we couldn't find a sturdy one in local stores. All his main tools fit in it, and he loves that his drill has its own sleeve. Only 2 problems so far. I found one of his drill bits on the floor, so it somehow came out of its pocket. The other problem is, he puts it in the basement with his tool bench, but has been using it so much, is tired of fetching it from the basement and decided to move it to the garage:). Even his kneeling pad fits in the bucket for jobs that require him to be on hands & knees. He couldn't be happier with this! I did get him the rubber grip for the handle and he loves that too-with the weight it can hold, it's almost a must-have. Think I will get one for my dad for his birthday!"
5,excellent,Quality product with ample space for tools and equipment. It comes complete with the rain cover. Excellent value at a good price
3,Good idea -- take it a little further,"This wide rubber handle definitely makes a big difference when lugging a heavy bucket of tools. Unfortunately, the concept is not fully developed. This is just a molded rubber tube slit along the bottom so you can fit it onto the bucket handle. Since there is no provision for latching it once installed, you'll find that you often pull it off of the bucket handle. A couple of button snaps molded into the split would do the trick...give it some thought Duluth Trading"
3,A little flimsy,"I'm using this to REPLACE the white handle that comes with the typical 5 gal gypsum tub which broke off. This new handle is bit flimsy, and with the full length slit down the middle it would fall off when bounced around in a truck with my other tools. I wrapped 2 small nylon straps around it to keep it from falling off. I guess it might work better if the original handle was still on. But if it was, why would I need this? I will say that it is much more comfortable than the handle that comes with the tubs when carrying heavy items in the tub."
3,"Easier on the hands, but...","I bought the Bucket Grip for use with full 5-gal. water buckets weighing about 40# each. The Bucket Grip certainly makes carrying full buckets easier by cushioning the hands. It would be a better product if there was some provision to keep them in-place, on the handle. I bought several ""Snappy Grip"" Bucket Handles, Item 3869, from U.S. Plastic Corp at the same time. The ""Snappy Grip"" is not as comfortable as the Bucket Grip, but it stays in-place. If I buy again, I will buy the ""Snappy Grip"" for this reason."
2,too heavy for a mule,"Well made shoe, but way too heavy for a mule. Don't know how anyone could keep them on and walk even with the strap used behind your heel. They don't bend easily."
2,frye harness mules,"FRYE Women's Belted Harness Mulei got this mule and it was rather heavy and clobby when i walked. I ordered the tan color. I am sorry, this was about the ugliest shoe i have ever bought. My foot kept on sliding back over the little leather heel when i walked and it was very uncomfortable. Sent back, of course."
5,Perfect from the first step!,"Right out of the box these shoes were perfect!I loved the look of the shoe and knowing they were Frye's, decided to endulge myself. I hesitated to wear them at first because I thought I'd need to break them in. However, the first time I did I wore them for at least 11 hours straight and my feet felt great!I would say the sizing is accurate. I usually take a 7.5 but sometimes need to push to an 8. I ordered 7.5 in the Fryes and they feel like they were custom fit for me."
3,Item was too big,"These were way too big, I sent tham back and reorderd, but then they were too small. I gace up. I have 2 pair of these already and they are wonderful shoes, I just couldn;t get the right size and didn't want to try a third time."
3,"I am a fan of Frye, but not these...","I purchased these clogs to upgrade from my Dansko Clogs for work. The craftmanship is the quality you expect from Frye, very nice. Unfortunately with these, the narrow toe pinched and my feet are narrow to begin with, they were far to heavy and did not feel like they would stay on my foot. When I say heavy, I am used to the heaviness of my Danskos and these far surpassed the weight of my Danskos. Way to much for me. I have boots by Frye that I am absolutely in love with so I was really looking forward to these. These did not have the same feel, I have high arches and these just did not provide the support that I need for my long work days. I spend my entire time on my feet and these just were not going to cut it. I'm very sad these didn't work out, but I still love Frye and will continue to purchase their boots."
5,Frye Mules,"Love the Frye Mules, made in the United States and fit perfectly. They look good with boot cut jeans. Very comfortable."
4,Are you ready to change?,"I found Astrology and Weight Control a helpful guide for exploring and facilitating change in your life by using astrology. If you are carrying around excess baggage that has manifested in excessive weight and you have the desire to change, this book will inspire you. Flynn methodically discusses the placement of Jupiter and Pluto in your natal chart. She then expands on Jupiter and Pluto transits, progressions and aspects. Flynn takes you on a journey of self discovery and then sums it up by offering seven steps for taking conscious responsibility to create the necessary action to manifest change in your life."
5,An excellent and insightfully written guide,"Astrology & Weight Control: The Jupiter/Pluto Connection is a metaphysical self-help guide to using astrology for identifying the challenges in one's life that could be manifesting themselves as extra poundage. Impressively written by Beverly Flynn who is an astrologer of thirty years' experience, Astrology & Weight Control informatively focuses on the roles of Jupiter as ""enlightener"" and Pluto as ""eliminator"" and how these two heavenly bodies influence mundane life according to astrological rhythms. An excellent and insightfully written guide meant to appeal to astrology enthusiasts of all experience levels, Astrology & Weight Control is a recommended example of ""practical metaphysics"" and highly recommended reading."
3,Just one step in the right direction,"A friend got this book recently and it offers an interesting approach. Having some experience in astrology, getting Jupiter and Pluto involved is too limited though if you'd ask me, and I feel like I need more information. Diane Cramer has an insightful article on her web site and I wish that it was available here. I am going to check that out first before committing to buying this."
3,repackaged,"all old info . . nothing new, no great discoveries, packaged to sell ""the weight connection"" pointless, sorry"
3,the bends...,"so ive just started grabbing some vinyl off amazon and had tho get this. infortunatly the way they packaged this product for shipping was not up to par, and in so the corner of the record was bent..well not the record but the albums cover or whatever...still keeping it not gonna bother with the S&H; bulls*&* , just thought ya'll should knowP"
3,A long way down!,"Wow, this was a surprise. A long way down from Bananas. I really loved the CD Bananas, it was one of the BEST 90's-2000's release by Deep Purple. So I expected this CD was going to also be good, but it's very mediocre. I really dont find a lot of fault with Ian's voice, he's still got the voice. The band also doesnt sound bad, they are very capable in the studio although Richie Blackmore is certainly missed. The problem with this CD is the songs are not that greatly written. There lies the problem, they dont have nothing that great to work with here. On Bananas, the songs were awesome, and the band shined! Bananas really was about as great of a moment as Perfect Strangers was, just the music public doesnt appreciate bands like Deep Purple anymore. Music has come to alternative, Teen Pop, Country, etc. It pretty much stings except for a few exceptions. But to me it seems like every time Deep Purple hits a HIGH note, it's followed by a low one. I will look forward to the next CD!"
1,this album sucks,"Borrrrring! That one word alone describes the latest from one of my alltime favorite bands. There is not one memorable riff on this entire album. I love Steve Morse's instrumental solo albums but he just does'nt write good rock riffs in a band context. These songs are meandering drivel. Ian Gillan is my favorite singer of all time, but on this one he just mailed it in. Maybe Gillan's Inn was his last hurrah. Nothing stands out here. Drumming by rote, blah-blah-blah bass playing and non-descript keyboards just make this whole effort a big waste of time.At least Bananas had some good songs on it.There is no tune here that you might catch yourself whistling or humming at work. Nothing,zilch,nada.You used to be able to rely on Deep Purple for a quality effort every time.I guess its time for the old boys to pack it in 'cause the well seems to have run dry."
4,"Deep Purple, More Like Deeply Influential","From Smother Magazine - [...]Calling all purveyors of excellent rock music. Deep Purple is back and here to right the wrongs of the mainstream rock-n-roll universe. A legendary band whose budding Hall of Fame credentials grow with each song, Deep Purple makes you crave for those bluesy rock days of yore all with spun melodic vocals from Ian Gillan whose range is daunting. The songs on ""Rapture of the Deep"" are eclectic journeys to the center of the rock sun with their almost forty years of influential rock-n-roll riding shotgun right alongside them. Still just as impressive as their debut and just as fiery as the middle of their career, Deep Purple have redefined the term ""legends""."
1,Miles off,"Okay, before I start ranting, I admit to buying Machine Head as my first ever Purple album. The band has produced an exceptional amount of great rock music since the late 60's and are live the best rock band out there. I bought this CD because I own everything they ever made. Slaves and Masters was a catastrophe, Bananas was almost as bad, Rapture of the Deep is dismal. I have not been able to listen to it in it's entirity once. It really is a case of, even for younger fans, if you want to hear THE Deep Purple, buy In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Made in Japan (must have), heck, even Who do we think we are is fast and furious at times. My advice to those thinking of buying this CD -- save your money."
3,Deep Purple-Rapture Of The Deep,"Probably the worst of the Steve Morse-era Deep Purple. Not entirely bad, mind you as ""Purpendicular"" and ""Abandon"" are both at least 4 star CDs IMO. However, ""Rapture Of The Deep"" features very few truly great Steve Morse guitar solos and not as many hooks as the 2 aforementioned CDs or even ""Bananas"" for that matter. Basically, just an ""ok"" record. If you haven't listened to Deep Purple yet without Ritchie Blackmore, don't start here. However, if you're a fan of the band I would recommend adding it to your collection, just don't get your hopes up too high."
2,Reaching for the No-Doze,"I got this a couple of months ago and gave it a few spins. I wasn't very impressed and figured it needed some time off. I'm listening to it as I write this review and I'm totally surprised at how boring this cd is. I didn't love Bananas, but it was more interesting than Rapture. For me, Purpendicular was their last good album. I have all the DP cd's and it saddens me to see their quality sagging so low. Time to get rid of Michael Bradford and try another producer. Maybe Rick Rubin can squeeze something good out of them?"
2,Without Ritchie Blackmore it's no DP,"I'm upset with myself for buying this CD. I own every DP CD all the way till 1993. After reading good reviews I gave it a chance and finaly purchased new DP with Steve M. Don't get me wrong, he is a good musican, but he is different person (than Ritchie), so his song writing is different - it's no Deep Purple. Same thing would happen, if Eddie Van Halen was replaced in VH with let's say Jimmy Page - it would not be VH, even though Jimmy is great.I'll just keep listening to the great old Deep Purple and will try to forget about Rapture of the Deep ASAP."
2,Disposable like the diapers they're wearing,"A major disappointment after JU JU said so many good things about Deep Morse. Overall their sound is bland, bbbbbboring, and old frt sounding. Fossilized vocals lacking melody, and most songs lacking good riffs. 2 stars was really generous but I do respect Airey on keys. But to me Morse is the biggest disappointment- he was great for Kansas but he just does not fit in. It really sounds like 5 musicians going in many directions. About as fresh as Ju JU underwear."
5,A corker!!,"Well, everybody is different and as such, everybody has different tastes. That truism out of the way, I would like to differ from an earlier reviewer and say that this is by far and away the best album so far of the Steve Morse era. It sparkles with great musicianship and songwriting.It is truly amazing! Deep Purple has gone through many metamorphoses during its history, and with each transformation, they always seem to attract great singers and great musicians. This 'mark' (is it 8 or 9? I've lost count!!) is no exception to the trend, and they are to be commended for a great album. There is not a weak track on it and.....I just love 'Money Talks'!!! I'm off to play it again!!!"
4,Enjoy it for what it is.......not what it isn't !,"It's not wise to make comparisons, so you won't get that from me. In a nutshell, if you like NEW music and (generally speaking) you like the TYPE of music that DEEP Purples plays, you can't go wrong with this CD. The musicianship is spectacular as you might expect, and the majority of songs are very entertaining. This is simply a Classic Rock n' Roll album in Purple fashion: hard & tight rhythym's, dazzling lead and acoustic guitar segments, the classic DP organ sound, and of course...the unmistakable voice of Ian Gillan. It's all there.After reading many reviews prior to the release of this CD, I decided I would buy it for only one reason: to listen to a Y2K jam session from one of history's greatest rock and roll bands. I wasn't looking for Machine Head 2 or Purpendicular Revisited, I just wanted something new and fresh from a group of extremely talented musicians. I got everything I expected...and then some."
3,Not bad...,"Not their best either. What I can't figure out is that the whole purpose of this rating system is to give honest opinions, as listeners of the music--so why do folks catch so much hell if they don't like it as much as other people or give it less than 4 stars? The songs are ok, no masterpieces anytime soon, but Money Talks & the title track are fantastic. Don't Let Go & Back to Back are nice,complimentary pieces, but the rest do not seem all that spectacular to me. Still worth buying though. I've listened to it somewhere between 20 & 30 times.... it may still grow on me, but as of now, I have to leave it at 3 stars. Gillan's voice still holds up on this record, but the last 2 tours I saw him on, he just didn't have the punch or range. I'll still be in the crowd for this tour."
4,Enjoyed it from its first spin... but...,"Get the 2-CD bonus set instead. OK? Do that. I'll have more review over there. Suffice to say if you're a fan of Gillan lyrics and Morse hooks, you'll enjoy this CD."
4,Horse Care,I bought this book as a gift for my friend's daughter who likes horses. I hope she likes it. I did.
4,"The Teds ""Pomp & Circumstance""","Very good book with lots of photographs that tell the ""Ted"" story alone without having to read the text.The text is also great and informative telling of the Teddy Boy subculture in Europe. A great coffee table book and a must have if you happen to dig roots rock n' roll. This is the only book that has authentic photo referenceof some truly remarkable pompadour pics. After lookin' at this book you'll be thumbin' through the pages with one hand and and laying two fingers of pomade in the other! This is some true greasy kid stuff. Makes you realize you just might be experiencing more bad hair days then you once thought. A great companion to an evening of easy listening with them nice Sun Records from times of old. So get gone lil' chillen and swipe yer pops plastic for this one!"
5,Cordless but NOt OPTICAL MOUSE!,the mouse is excellente but the sellers not specify that this is a ball mouse!
4,Judgement Time,"I thought the Judge's new album was good. I saw him in concert before the album came out and once he got off stage I knew I wanted his album. I am fully supporting this album! Listen to the lyrics and you will understand why. Judge D is one of the few that will speak whatever is on their mind. It is not an album that all it talks about is love, sex, girls, or money. My favorite song is ""Nuthin Left"" that was the first song I heard when I was at the show. Taxman came out in a body-bag then jumped out and then Judge D came out I fell in love right there! Personally I love all the Suburban Noize Records albums, I have most of them and I love them all and they will always be great this album has not made me feel any different about that! If you think that you would like it even alittle you should get it I know you will fall in love with it I have and Im more of a Kottonmouth Kings person! This album is very good I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars!"
2,Tape Deck Killa,What did I expect after seeing this guy live with a tape deck with prerecorded vocals and beats and the same stchitck of taxman? This album contains tracks not good enough for the KMK albums and the same lyrical assualt that every other rap/rock wannabe offers. Get KMK or corporate or the Junkeez and avoid the rest of the subnoize NOIZE! The judge is another gimmick used to hype up someone with a lack of talent PERIOD!
3,My Review,"I think that this album could have been a whole lot better. It wasn't that bad of an album, but most of the songs seemed to have lacked something. I think the best track on here was Universal Soulja. Also the two tracks with KMK members Johnny Richter and D-loc were nice. But the other tracks weren't put together as well as they should have been. Maybe he'll do better on his next album."
4,interesting marine sailing story,"It's great to find a new Author. He rates up there with some of the best so far. I enjoyed this book having spent time in the Boston area and also enjoyed the facts on repo of marine items. The story was quite suspensful and lead thru to a excellent completion. Plenty of suspense and loaded with action. I rate this up with Hunter,Parker, Cussler and those at the top of their game. Be sure to read this one. Your enjoyment is guarenteed."
3,Waking the Dead,"There are some helpful insights in this book but, for me, the language is a bit too flowery and he takes a long time to make his point. Good though,"
1,The Worst Christian Book Ever,"Waking the Dead is filled with New Age philosophy, constant inappropriate movie references, and theology that is so weird that even the author admits that many of his friends have abandoned him over his wacko theories. He mixes New Age spirituality with Catholic mysticism and 14-century theology to come up with a virtually worthless book. It is a complete waste of money--I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except that he wants us to focus more on our ""heart."" Yet his claim that the heart is always ""good"" and that modern Christianity is wrong from proclaiming that the human heart is born bad is just plain unBiblical. And his constant use of The Matrix, Lord of The Rings, The Wizard of Oz and other fantasy references reduces his credibility to zero. Don't buy this book if you don't want to waste money."
2,Rambling & Drawn Out...,This book should have been a pamphlet. The main idea of the book is reiterated over & over. The writing style presumes my life's experiences to duplicate the author's and is very limited in scope.
2,Try it at your own risk,"I certainly wouldn't be the first to question the wisdom of meddling with nature to the extent outlined in this book. Down the ages, commentators from Mary Shelley to George A. Romero have illustrated the potential negative consequences of achieving what this book shows you how to achieve; the ""glory"" can soon turn sour indeed.Credit is certainly due to the author for his revolutionary method of integrating the four ""streams"" to achieve a state of total animation. Now that this knowledge has been made so publicly available, though, we await with foreboding the terrible consequences for humanity..."
5,Must Read - Well Done,"While I am not of his particular religious persuasion I found the book right on and fascinating. Christianity needs to wake up and be for the masses and not the few and this book details what is going on. I found his work thoughtful, with real intent and it woke me up to some of the realities I have been feeling. It is my first Eldridge book but wont be my last. It is provocative and timely and a must read if you care whats happening to our world."
2,Misinformed,"I like the book, I am glad I bought it, though I was misinformed about the book. It said it was a new book, it said ""Condition: new"" that was not true. There was a note written on the inside of the cover of the book, if I wanted a used book I would have ordered a used book."
5,Eldredge does it again,"This is my favorite book of the year. Eldredge is challenging is as the Church to wake up and take responsibility in the war that is upon is. Quoting Aragorn's works to the King who refuses to fight in Lord of the Rings: Open war is upon you, whether your risk it or not. The Church in America has been asleep for too long. Thank you, John."
5,This book is for those who already know Christ,"This book is for those who already know Christ and want to grow closer in their walk with Him. I believe so many people misinterpret John's message. He says, ""The heart is good."" What people must understand is that he is talking about a redeemed heart. People continue to sin, but sin is of the flesh. This is clearly backed up by the Bible. John clearly points out that we are at war, and we will always have to battle against sin. To be honest and truly follow our heart, our redeemed heart, is to follow Christ. John does not try to bring any glory to himself, but clearly gives it all to God.This book has truly helped me in my life. It has helped me to improve my walk, which I of course still do in battle each and every day. It also must be said that no book written by a man should be anyone's complete guide to life and inspiration. The bible is still the ultimate and irrefutable guide."
5,Waking the Dead by John Eldredge,"Wow, this book is so significant! Can't recommend it enough. I've already given away 4 copies of this book. One that ALL in the body of Christ should read. This book is the BEST book I've ever ready and along with the Bible would be the one other book I'd have to have."
5,This book will change your life...,EVERYONE needs to read this book. It will change your life; you will never view God or yourself in the same way again. You can have life and have it to the full -- that's what Jesus wants for you. Your heart is good! (and Jesus can and will mend your broken heart and make it whole again.)
2,Eldredge does it again...literally.,"""My heart is good. My heart matters to God.""I will keep this review rather short: read Sacred Romance or Journey of Desire. They deal with the same thoughts. I think John Eldredge is a great communicator, I love several books he has written but this book feels like a mere rewrite of his previous books."
5,Excellent,"Jesus said, ""I came that they might have life, and have it abundantly"" (John 10:10). This book explores what it means to be fully alive in a Christian sense. A great read for Christians on any stage of the journey, from just starting out to those needing a little renewal to keep the fire alive."
5,A great book,I am using the book more as a devotional than a read through. So much to think about. Gave a gift to many friends.
2,"Good, but not the best","Though entertaining, this was definately not one of Jacque's stronger Redwall titles. There was relatively no rising action, and it came to a swift and rushed conclusion. Try his previous titles for a more entertaining read."
5,"Great Book, Loved It","I loved this book. It was a great read. Tiria finds the two injured birds, Brantalis and Pandion. She also has a few visions of Martin, who tells her to sail for Green Isle. This lets Tiria go on her adventures while the Abbeybeasts unpuzzle the riddles. It also speeds the plot up a lot. Tiria finds Cuthbert, and sails to Salamandastron. There she picks up 30 more hares, her regalia,and sails to Green Isle. There the book comes to an excellent conclusion."
1,Feels like marlfox.... again,"I've read Brian Jacques books for a long time, and the first were truly unique and interesting. High Rhulian, on the other hand, had almost the same plot as Marlfox (an earlier book). The author has used the same formula as many of his other books:1. A group of young squirrels/otters/mice/badgers/whatever go on a quest, following a group of adults2. Villains act extremly stupid stratigectly.3. The heroes defeat a huge army with nary a causalty.4. One young animal from said book becomes a great leader.This formula has been used too often. This book was so pathetic, I was rooting for the bad guys at the end. If you want to read a better book by the same writer, try ""The Legend Of Luke"" or something."
3,"Informative, written for young adults, very expensive","This is the only biography I have found about the famous Siamese Twins. While it has lots of good information about them (Did you know that Cheng and Eng lived in different houses and both were slave owners in the American South?), it is written for young adults, with fairly large print. Essentially this is a medium length essay, which could just about fit in a Sunday Paper Magazine article, for twenty dollars. Not a bad book, but a kid's book, and a costy one."
4,Great read,"The Inactivist by Chris Eaton is well written and funny at most times. It's a satirical look at the dehumanizing effect of a society that's constantly looking to sell everything, from consumer products to emotions. This is Chris Eaton's first novel and I'm sure he's bound to have greater success with his future writings once he's gained more experience.Fred (www.freedrowpublishing.com)"
1,Just Isn't Any Good,"I was a big fan of the TV series, and enjoyed the first ""film"" ""Benders Big Score"" This is the third of four Futurama ""Movies"". Sigh. There is just nothing in this film that is worth mentioning. I would love to go into a lengthy detailed dissertation on why this movie was so bad, but that would be giving this waste some level of credibility it doesn't deserve, so I will keep it brief.There is just nothing that is funny, unique, inventive, memorable or worthwhile on this disc. It is the story of Fry, who gains the ability to read minds, a shifty cult, and LeLa joining a Enviro-Femi-Nazi group whose goal is to stop Amy's dad from building a mini golf course. It was just so poorly put together, with no real character, lines, dialog or plot that it was a waste of time, even worse than ""Beast with a Billion Backs""Anyway, only watch this if you are a DIE HARD Futurama fan, otherwise save your money and watch almost anything else, or read a book.T"
2,Has its moments but the worst of the 4,Im a hard core fan but this one wasent a good story. The jokes were mediocre and the Bender story went nowhere. The Nixon stuff was funny as always but all and all this film dragged and even for a comedy the story was stupid and poorly developed.
2,Worst of the 4,"I consider myself a hardcore Futurama fan, I've watched the original series at bedtime for years alternating between regular audio and commentary, the 3 movies so far ranged from great to so-so, but this one sucked. I didn't really like it at all."
4,Good Finale.,"If this is the last Futurama then I'm happy how it ended. The humor is the same as it ever was. Visually the movie looks impressive and it's a joy to watch for any long time Futurama fan. Sounds and music is superb. The opening track with Seth is beautiful. As far as DVD content goes it's standard. The commentary on this DVD isn't as strong as other ones. There isn't a lot of information provided during it to make it worthwhile. Other special features include deleted scenes and animatics, a funny skit with Amy Wong's voice actor, lastly some how to drawl stuff that previous was on other season DVDs. The packaging is awful. I still can't believe they went with this greenbull garbage. I was a sound DVD case that doesn't have the potential of scratch my disc during shipping. I don't care if it saves the planet.So get it if you are a fan of Futurama. If you are just starting to get into it I'd get the season DVDs first and maybe the first movie."
3,"Ok, but nothing great","So here is what may be the last view we ever get of Futurama, and if that's the case... well, they could've gone out on a higher not.Don't get me wrong. Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder is ok and all, but it suffers from the same problem as two of the other three direct-to-DVD movies (the exception being Bender's Game), in that it just doesn't feel like the show did.Part of this is because they are doing it as a movie rather than as episodes, but it was written in an episodic form so it can be aired later on Comedy Central. You don't have to reach too far to see where the episode cuts are, and that causes plot lines developed in episode one (like Bender's seduction of a fine ladybot), to be dropped well before episode four.Still, it had its funny moments and there wasn't anything particularly wrong with it. I just hope that if they do more Futurama they have the good sense to go back to doing it as seasons and not these little movies, cause just don't work."
1,cant get the damn blu ray to play,"i have an insignia blu ray player, and this is the only disc that wont play. ive tried 3 copies. anyone know why i cant play this thing? i press ""enter"" and it loads and goes back to the main menu with the music and options. pisses me off."
4,"A worthy finale, but not top-tier Futurama","I have now watched three of the four ""feature length"" Futurama discs, and while I enjoyed them all, I felt that each suffers from the requirements of having to stretch out a storyline to 88 minutes, and/or to stitch together several stories to fill the time. The series episodes were always about the little things -- sly cultural references (often glimpsed only briefly in the background), snappy one-liners, and character tics. Plot lines were usually only secondary. That's OK for 22-23 minutes, but a movie-length production requires a more coherent story line and continuity. ""Wild Green Yonder"" feels like four TV episodes strung together, and the result is less than the sum of the parts. As I said, I enjoyed this effort, and I'd recommend it to other Futurama fans, but it's not the best of series."
2,"Unfortunately, not as good as the rest","I am a big futurama fan and own all the movies and the seasons, but this left me feeling like the original series was much better :("
2,forgot the jokes,"I love Futurama. Unfortunately, this last movie left me wondering where were all the jokes. The story itself was flat and didn't impress me."
3,Definitely the worst of the bunch,"oh well, so this is how it ends. (sigh) the ending was nice...sweet, but the story was all over the place and for most of it, it was just plain boring....it's not that the jokes were bad, there just weren't any jokes at all. And once again, where is Nibbler. They don't even mention him again. Overall, very disappointing for a final movie. I wish it had some sort of preview of maybe what we can expect next, either the show coming back or another movie, i don't know. This one just was the weakest one for me."
4,More Futurama,"Still entertaining, although I don't think they've perfected the new format. However, I'll still buy the next adventure if more come out."
2,A disappointing end to a fantastic series,"What can I say? The plot was preachy and annoying yet still bland. The characters, save for Bender, the Professor (and maybe Leela), didn't act like themselves (witty, insightful Fry?), the jokes were just boring for the most part, and the film in general just seemed to contrived and stretched out a lot longer than it should've been.Now, I do happen to think it was better than ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"", but it's nowhere near as good as the first film and pales in comparison to the series. The only really good thing to point out is that the little event at the very end should've been them back at the 18th hole, leaving open the possibility of bringing back the series and, hopefully, this time, keeping in its proper format.All in all a lackluster finale for the greatest animated comedy series in history."
4,nice gags but flawed,"I thought the opening and closing sequences of this film were great; the opening song in particular may have been the funniest gag in any of the Futurama episodes or movies. The plot, however, did not seem well considered. The environmental and feminist jokes were consistently lame, and many of them were repeated over and over again. The celebrity cameos were wasted as well. Who thought that Snoop Dog sequence was worth the labor of a dozen Korean animators?Nonetheless, it's thoroughly enjoyable. Adios, Futurama, we'll miss you."
1,A mess that isn't funny at all.,"Unfortunately it is a bad end to a great series. The final movie is by far the worst of the 4 and lacks the sly humor that made the series great, like Bender having nightmares about the number 2. The movie is a jumbled mess of political messages, odd characters and one liners. It feels like a complete waste of time. Nothing in this movie felt consistent with characters or the old show. It is like they took these characters and stuck them in a completely unrelated political commercial. I didn't laugh once. It is too bad. I used to love this show."
3,last Futurama =(,"Into the Wild Green Yonder was not the best of Futurama, but it wrapped up the series well enough."
4,better than the last one.,Out of all four DVDs the first one was the best. The second one was ok. The third one was crap! Horrible- and I'm a big Futurama fan. The fourth one was good too. I hope they keep coming out with new DVDs.
3,The Lost World should have stayed lost,"This novel didn't appeal to me as much as the first Jurassic Park.Micheal Crihton should have left Ian Malcolm out of this story because any person who had suffered a life threatening experience like he had to face, would never go back to a similar place to Jurassic Park . The first novel had a plot which connected to everything in the story. This Novel was basically go to the Island, run from Dinosaurs,then escape from the Island. In the begining of the book Dinosaurs were being washed up on beaches in Costa Rica. The only reason they were going to go to the island was to see what was driving these creatures into the ocean. It never came out with why the dinosaurs were swimming from the island. There was some good action throughout the book . I was disappointed with this novel and that is why I only gave it 3 Stars."
5,Very Good book,"Very interesting. Although the plot seemed to be simpler than that of the first book, the action and depth of the story and charaters were way beyond the first book. The dinosaurs were redone with even better detail and habitual inclinations than in the first book, most notably the fact a t-rex can now see stationary targets"
3,10cc/Godley&Creme:Changing Faces(VHS),Content Was Pretty Good But Clarity Wasn't All That Great. Had A Few Squiggly Lines Throughout The Movie. Had To Use Tracking. A Fair Deal For The Money Paid.
4,Great history of the early years of football,Does a really good job of covering it from the turn of the century through till the 1958 Colts-Giants championship game.A really interesting read if you're into the history of football and the rule and tactic changes over the years.
3,Junior Varsity Level Work,"You can gather a few interesting nuggets of history and information from this work, but it's major characteristics are: rambling, sequence jumping, and repetition. Like all of Madden's books, you're left feeling gypped and hungry. Could have used a pro-level coach and a plan."
1,NEVER AGAIN will I purchase anything made by PRICE-PFISTER!!,"(White unit) Although I did not purchase this from Amazon.com, I bought it from my local home improvement store (my first mistake). After installing it, I tried it out, but the spayer would not work properly. You press the button, but water continued to come out of the faucet. I called the home improvement store to return/exchange it, but they advised me to call Price-Pfister. After explaining the problem to Price-Pfister, they too refused to exhange it and said they knew what the problem was with the diverter and would send me parts. My second mistake! I didn't know I was part of their Price-Pfister free plumbing repair staff!! I got new diverter parts with schematic instructions to field strip the entire unit to fix it. It still does not work properly. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER PURCHASE PRICE-PFISTER!! Hope you look elsewhere for a different manufacturer!!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED????????????,"The book starts off good, get's great, easy reading....then BAM!the story ends and the propaganda starts. ""Ed's Children"" part two...talks only of all the Psycho, Chainsaw Massacre, stuff that spawned from his man. I am sure there would have been a bit more information to stuff into the first half of this book and drop most of the second half.(63 pages of 167).The guy was a strange one... add it to your Serial Killer library."
1,I enjoyed the story however I didn't enjoy the writing.,"This book was horrible... the story was interesting but the writer thought it'd be cool to write a bunch of cuss words every chapter or so, and had a poor command of the English language. I mean I don't speak it perfectly, but at least if I were going to write a book, I'd write it well. To paraphrase Capote on Kerouac: That's not writing, it's typing!"
4,Quite a clever method of detailing Gein's trek into insanity,"A good book, overall. It gives a reasonably clear description of Gein's upbringing as well as the contributions to the deterioration of his psyche. Embellished with details which I still am unsure if they came from Gein's admissions or are fabrications from the author, the book tells a frightening story which is so macabre, it borders on fiction."
4,It was so creepy but exciting reading about what he did.,"Omigosh, this book totally made me come in to the real world while I was reading it. Not only was it disgusting but it gave photos which lets you take a realy good look at this gory psycho."
4,"New Gein-er, interesting Book! Great Intro to the man.","I am new to Gein, never heard of him before I started cruising amazon.com's true crime books. I really enjoyed the style of the book, its design, and the pop culture review at the end. I rented as many of the movies as are available and appreciate the new eye I have been given with which to see them. Facinating!"
1,"Chronologically disorganized, author has immature approach","Though this book does provide an overview of the Ed Gein case, I found the lack of chronological organization annoying. The author reveals his age in the second part of the book, by presenting the money-making unevolved cultishness surrounding this truly pitiable, completely insane man as ""cool."" The Ed Gein Fan Club (with address included) was just a little too much for me. I also found the author's gratuitous use of profanity in his analysis to be another indication of his immaturity, both as a writer and as a person. As someone with an interest in the facts and psychology behind serial murderers, I found that, in the latter part of the book, I learned much more about the psychology of the author -- and it wasn't pretty. I would not recommend this book, and encourage anyone interested in this subject to seek a more complete, intelligent presentation in a better-written, better-organized volume."
5,This book was Awsome!,This book is one of the best I've ever read. I love hearing about Logan's past with Team-X. And Christopher Golden has never been better. And I liked the way the book went from past to present. No Wolverine fan shold be without this book!
1,Politically Correct Logan..... yuck!,"Not a very good read really.. Annoying back and forth timeline, All the characters seem to be thinking with the same personality,( even using the same phrases in their thoughts!) And worst of all, a strangely weak and spiritless Wolverine.. Especially in the present time. His quoting poetry.. being concerned about his smoking and a rather feminine reaction to being flirted with had me wondering who this guy was. Poor Silver Fox, we are told.. lies buried somewhere in Canada after having been murdered by Creed. Logan himself wonders why he hasn't avenged her.. Whats with that? It certainly isn't explained in the book. I wish a really good writer would take Logan and do something with him. He is an excellent character and deserves more than this."
2,So inconsistent with the comics.,"For one thing Wolverine has his metal skeleton in this novel, but he didn't in the comics during the time this is supposed to take place. It also makes no reference to the fact that Wolverine met the black widow before this adventure, because he met the Widow when she was a child in 1941."
1,A really bad surprise...,"Though I'm use to buy Marvel Comics books from the web, the time I opened the box with this one I felt rather stupid. I expected to see a comics book, and this is instead a juvenile novel with a simple plot and 1 dimensional characters, printed in a large, dumb font, with no drawing but the cover. To go through an X-men book without the graphics is like to watch an action movie blindfolded: next time, caveat emptor... I still wonder I could I have find out what it really was."
2,Pretty slow,"After reading Golden's great 'Predator's Smile' Daredevil novel, I was excited to see what he would do with Wolverine. While nota bad book, the pacing is slow and the action is kind of farbetween for a Wolverine tale. All the characters seemed a littletoo two dimensional unlike 'Predator' which brought out the bestin all the cast. While I hate to do this, as I am a Golden fan,you should pass on this one and read 'Predator'. (If you likeDD anyway)"
3,"Great Story, Would Love to see it in a comic form though!!","This is a great story of Wolverine and the rest of the project X team. It was very well written, but I'm a comic lover and I love to see the beautiful artwork that most illustrators come out with. I think this story would be great if it were in a comic form, what can I say I love pictures!!"
5,Outstanding,"Never before have I read a book that could encourage my faith and be enthralling at the same time. I read this book in now time flat! Karen talks about real life issues that face everyone, even ""good Christians"" and deals with them in a way that is God-pleasing. Awesome way to stay in the Word even while reading fiction!"
5,Wonderful story a must read!,This is one of Karen's best books that I have read and I have read almost all of her books. I would recommend this book to everyone.
5,When Joy Came to Stay,I believe Karen Kingsbury addressed an issue for many women. Dispression has had a stigma attached to it forever. Many women are afraid to seek help because what others may say. The story itself was positive and probably many areas true regarding foster homes. I'm glad the ending was upbeat and gave glory to God.
4,"At last--some ""real"" fictional characters!","I did enjoy the writing of this book. There really was not a ""slow"" point in the entire story. Though the plot became a bit predictable at the end (my reasoning for 4 stars rather than 5), the story dealt honestly with depression and the ""masks"" Christians feel the need to wear to be accepted."
3,"A disapointing work of literature, but still worth reading","As a piece of literature it disapoints. Her character development is a bit shallow. The main characters follow predictable paths and are two dimensional. The bad guys are really bad and the good guys are really good- a bit ""Ho Hum"".The entire plot of the novel is obvious by page 48 with no surprizing twists or turns. The result is a work of fiction of no value for people who have to fight real clinical depression. It leaves one with a dangerously false impression that solving depression is nothing more than going back to your past and correcting the lies one has told. It also reinforces the false belief of many Christians that depression is the result of sin. It is instead often inherited and may have nothing to do with being dishonest. The book is out of touch with real three dimentional people who have problems that are not solved in a few weeks. I was hoping for more."
5,great purchase,"Hal Leonard makes the best tab books by far, every detail of the song is layed out for you."
4,"comprehensive, varied approach to modern scrapbooking","I have several scrapbooking idea/resource books & this is one of my favorites. It covers the basics comprehensively which is essential for the beginner and refreshing for the advanced enthusist. The chapters are inclusive of most all scrapbooking 'occassions.' Heritage, Home & Family, Cropping Parties, Holidays, Babies, Sports & Leisure, Weddings, etc... The techniques are suprisingly varied because of the many contributors, so all the layouts do not look the same! Included in each chapter is an appropriate font example. Near the end there is also a photo gift chapter. If you're only planning to buy one idea/resource book for your hobby right now, this would be the one to get. I turn to it more than all the others."
1,Very disapointing,"I waited the arrival of this book with a lot of expectative, but it's very disapointing. It's very childish and give not many ideas at all. To me, the worst thing is that it works with fabrics that you only can find if you are at USA; it doesn't help you to make really new creations. I'd like a book that could teach a person from everywhere how to make great creative scrapbooks, and not this one."
4,Had a good ending,"This book was good. It was pretty boring in the beginning, but it turned out to have a really good ending. I find that the most exciting parts of the book is at the end of each chapter. I'd get this book, though. It's good if you like a boring beginning."
5,This is a really GREAT book!!,This mystery will keep you on the edge of your seat. I even learned some new stuff about the Internet that I didn't know before. This is a book that everyone can enjoy. I sure did!!!
4,Clax11's Nancy Drew Review,"This nancy Drew book is sure to grab anyone's attention. With nonstop action and fun, you get to take the next guess!"
1,"PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS PLASTIC, NOT GLASS","This product came up under a search for ""glass thermos"" and it is definitely NOT. I've wasted the money for the product and its very high shipping cost for something I'm just going to donate. Look elsewhere if you want something safer from which to drink."
4,Handbook of Pediatric Mock Codes,A very helpful book for running mock codes for House Officers. It helped me feel more comfortable running mock codes (andthe real ones when they happened) because you continually practice a method for conducting the codes. I attribute three lives saved b/c this book prepared me to handle several code situations instead of having a brain fart. Scenarios are realistic. Helpful introduction reviews the roles of each participant and exhorts the leader to know each participants roles to better run the codes. Good comments on teaching points for each specific scenario. The scenarios have enough flexibility built into them to make each a mega code or to just to keep it simple and focus on the ABC's. Only drawback is that some treatment options emphasize style points but are presented as standard of care...not enough to detract from the overall helpfulness of the book.
4,A Blessing,This book is very encouraging for people who are facing hard times and do not know where to turn to in those difficult times. If people would just put their whole trust in God as Evangelist Murray and her husband did; Then they too will be able to operate in the will of God.
2,That's not the way it was -- there was more to it!,"Don't confuse CRONKITE REMEMBERS with A REPORTER'S LIFE. The latter is a genuine memoir from TV's second greatest journalist (next to Edward R. Murrow). The former is a brief tape that breezes through events so quickly as to be wholly unsatisfying. Walter Cronkite has lived a long enough life and had a rich enough career to merit two autobiographies, but CRONKITE REMEMBERS is so superficially brief as to trivialize his career and the events he covered rather than add to our understanding of them. This isn't a terrible tape. It isn't unpleasant to listen to. I liked hearing Cronkite's voice, which I could only imagine while reading A REPORTER'S LIFE. But I was left wanting more - much, much more. That's why CRONKITE REMEMBERS merits a low rating. Skip this and get A REPORTER'S LIFE."
4,medical junkie,"This book is the story of many people, told by someone who experienced what many others experience; that is a failure by medics to LISTEN and BELIEVE when someone says they are ill, they are not making it up.Written with a sense of frustration that whilst we are ill and medics dont listen to us we are loosing years from our lives and our family and friends are also loosing the life we should be sharing with them.It is worth reading and there are some interesting facts in there which may be relevant to others."
5,It works great,"I am a professional engineer of more than 40 years. I have used more types oscilloscope than I can remember. Of course there are much better scopes on the market and they cost a LOT more. This is a nice scope for occasional uses as part of your hobby efforts around your workshop. I really like its ease of use. I use it with a Windows XP PC that has a parallel port and had no problems setting it up and getting it to work. There is a newer version with a USB interface, with a little higher cost."
3,Decent little film marred by poor print & transfer,"Nice little exploitation gem from 1938. A couple who is secretly married (he's from wealthy background, she is not) and she has a child. His parents want nothing to do with her and the child's mother decides to put the kid in an orphanage to be adopted. We see the kid get older and eventually fall in with shady people. The mother becomes a judge and the original father becomes a crook. We see ""racy"" dancing and youths having a party with booze. (Tame now, but not then).The print is rather bad on this one, especially the first reel, which is almost unwatchable and the original titles are missing. The audio needs to be raised in volume to be heard clearly. The story is good enough to recommend, but the print and transfer knock the rating down two notches."
5,My Scene girls are beautiful!! Bratz SUCKS!!,"My Scene movie was so much fun, I loved the music, I watched it with my friends everyone loved it!It was long, but I hope they make more My Scene movies!!I love My Scene girls!! I HATE bratz!I want to see more Delancey dolls."
5,Great movie - get this for your girls now!!,"This movie was fabulous!! My husband just brought home a screener that was sent to him, and my 10-year-old daughter and her friends LOVED it!!! I would definitely recommend this to any moms out there - it's very entertaining while still teaching girls strong morals (i.e. your friendships with your girlfriends are more important than boys!). The addition of characters like Lindsay Lohan - and even a cameo by Harvey Weinstein - were entertaining for me, too. I can't say enough good things about this movie - my daughter already loved My Scene, and this movie just made her love it even more."
4,My Scene Goes Hollywood,"My girls, who are 5 and 7 years old, love it. Be warned that the girls talk a lot about boys and having boyfriends but I had no problem with it."
4,"Nice stuff, girls!","~My Scene made a great movie. I really like the animation, and when i mean REALLY i mean REALLY. It's very detailed cartoon drawings, in my opinion. All i can say is, this movie is awsome. I don't like lindsay lohan, really, but this movie is pure AWSOME.....So get it, and get Bratz starin' and stylin'!!!!Meg -MeggiePS: WILL THE MY SCENE GIRLS CONTINUE TO BE FRIENDS?? GET THE DVD AND FIND OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~"
1,It's that bad,Dont get me wrong i love the my scene gang but the movie was so boring i wanted to trun my dvdplayer off and go on my computer and stare at the bratz site i love bratz too dont waste your money on this movie im so stupid i could have boughted roxxi now i cant anymore until my b-day the movie was 70 minsutes long and it sucked badley im sorry my scene fans but it's the truth just buy the dolls. You will regreat it it was just about lindsay lohan and how she acted snobbish.
5,"I can't get enough of these mattel movies. They have made 6 barbies, 3 my scenes, and 2 polly","The dolls are awesome too. This movie is so funny, and a good lesson too. If you like this movie(you should if you are researching it), then I suggest you get the other ones."
1,This movie sucks,"Okay, I am a beginner on collecting dolls right, well, I like Bratz and My Scene dolls, but I only wanted to like one kind of doll. I realised their movies were going to be on TV, I wanted to watch them before I get them. And I saw this movie and EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! I hated it so much. I mean, Madison was a total jerk to her friends, what is up with that, that is like the only thing this movie was about, and their outfit weren't nice or fashionable at all. And what was the deal, they didn't even go to hollywood. And I hate Linsey Lohan, and that Ryan guy wasn't cute at all. And it is sooooooo innapropriate that Madison kissed that guy like 10 times, gross too. And So I watched the Bratz movie, and it was soooooooooo much better. They became rock stars, and became friends with a lead singer from a band, Roxxi. This movie was terrible, I suggest the Bratz movie instead."
2,I am going to tell the truth,I didn`t liked this movie that much.[...]My scene movie is kinda boring.MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
2,yawn...........,"Hi. Actually I didn't buy this movie, I watched it on Nickelodeon. And it's sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring.[...]. Don't buy this. PLEASE.Br@tz GirlP.S.- Sorry to any girls who like My Scene dolls. It's just my opinion. Please don't be mad."
1,MISREPRESENTATION OF COMPTOIR SUD FROM PARIS!!!!,I have been using this perfume for over 15 years. I should have known with the price being so low something was wrong. The perfume is not the same. It'S a weak attempt of the real thing. The scent is different. The perfume looses its scent rapidly. I knew for sure when my son said Mom I like your new perfume and then he went ha ha ha. Even he could tell! I don't think the company will be very happy to hear you are selling perfume under their name and it is definetly not!I tried this once before buying some perfume being lured in by the low price only to be completely blown away that the perfume was bootleg. My husband ordered this for me.This time I'm not going to lay back and do nothing. I'm going to contact Paris and let them know about the false adverstisement. I don't think they will be very happy. I would prepare for some bad news.I'm stuck with one closed new bottle of perfume purchased from you and I would like to return it.
4,Sooooo Good,"I absolutely LOVE this perfume, it is sweet and smells just as amazing on as it does in the bottle."
3,"If you are a beginner to XSLT, you might want to reconsider another book","This book does not start with actually teaching XSLT. Chpt1 is called Beyond HTML (no XSLT) Chpt2 is about XML, Chpt3 is creating HTML from XML (see what I am getting at, SHOW ME THE XSLT!). After getting this book I actually immediately ordered Sams Teach Yourself XSLT in 21 Days because I know from experience these books get you right into the subject matter and get you going. However this book will be valuable due to it's broad and detailed scope if you have 6 months time to eventually digest it all. At times it is overly wordy on insignificant matter and instead of building on simple examples as you progress the author uses a complete TV guide right off the start which I find to be quite complex to start teaching people!"
2,Sorry. Can't recommend it this time.,"I highly recommended the edition of this book that caters for XSLT 1.0 and thats where the problem of this book lies. The author uses the same base material and examples but doesn't highlight the differences for XSLT 2.0. To those who say didn't I see the word Beginning in the title, yes, Beginning XSLT 2.0 there are vast changes between the versions and the Beginner tag can still be applicable to experienced XSLT 1.0 developers migrating to XSLT 2.0. Those who try to do so are ill served by this book. Buy Sal Mangano's XSLT Cookbook 2nd edition instead."
1,Too complex for real beginners,"I am in a summer XML class for my master's program. We used another book for basic XML and Tennison's book for XSLT. For just learning about XSLT, this book is way over my head. The running example throughout the book is too complex for learning the basics and the author assumes the ""beginning"" reader is more advanced than this. Very disappointing and frustrating to read."
2,Not incredibly useful...yet.,"I paged through this book and Ms. Tennison's other book on the subject ""Beginning XSLT."" I ended up purchasing her first book, ""Beginning XSLT"" because XSLT 2.0 has yet to gain widespread acceptance in both client and server side technologies. The difference in price between the books was $20 (at least at my local Border's)...so I went with the cheaper one which instructs you on how to use XSLT that will actually work (1.0). This book, ""Beginning XSLT,"" I highly recommend. Easy to read. Very in depth. A great book on the subject."
3,Why focus on a soap opera?,"This book is pretty good about explaining XSL. My one complaint is that the author focuses a little too much on a British soap opera in her examples. Sure it works as an example, but when your demographic is mostly male and American why would you choose a television show directed towards British females? (Of course I know why, but it simply doesn't make sense thinking of marketing.)"
2,Disappointing,"The author of this slim volume is a London-born poet who spent a significant period of time in India studying Buddhism before returning to England to found a Buddhist center. He retains a Western poetic bent -Allen Ginsberg, John Donne, Virginia Woolf, Philip Larking are all present by allusion or dedication.His poetry covers a wide range of implied beliefs - the title poem is highly environmental, ""The Pilgrim"" a reflection on Tannhauser, ""Mother Goose Revisited"" a reflection on childhood and sexual roles ... The depth I expected from the author's long practice of Buddhism is absent. Rather the book presents an erratic collection that is likely appreciated by those who know the man behind the poems - but which do not stand on their own."
3,Meat Baller,Product is as advertised was one of the better ones I purchased. It could be and should be made more ergonomically comfortable even if it means having to raise the price
3,Worth the cost of admission.,"My son thinks this is okay, and with the amount of stimulus advertisers hurl at kids these days that's high praise indeed."
5,Music is average but concept is incredibly creative,"Although you will quickly get bored with the music itself which isn't particularly great, the creativity behind this DVD is brilliant - the authors have shown world-class imagination in their creation of these virtual instruments and everyone should see this DVD at least once.My particular favorite has to be Pipe Dream. Almost all of them look like the instruments could actually be created in real life.....Rube Goldberg, move over!!!"
5,Many reviewers neglect to mention...,"This disc already has plenty of reviews, but this needs to be said: After watching the songs being played, be sure to go back to the main menu and select the Construction/Commentary option, which is included on the 2004 edition.In it, the author shows how the different instruments were constructed. Slow-motion animation shows all the different layers and objects as they are laid down, and he gives a voice-over along the way. This is sure to be fascinating to anyone who enjoys shows like ""This old house"" or ""Engineering marvels.""Computer programmers will similarly enjoy hearing how the music actually drives the instruments, which are just software subroutines reacting to the MIDI inputs."
4,cool,"i watched the second one first and was marginally dissapointed because it was not as good as the second production. yet, it is still awesome to veiw"
5,I was mesmorized too!,"A lot of people say they were mesmorized by this--I was too! I was wandering around Fry's electronics one day (big chain electronics store--like Best Buy on steroids, and much cooler), and they were playing this.I stood and stared. And stared, and stared.The way the graphics sync to the music and the ""instruments"" play is totally awesome. I've never seen anything like it. For some bizarre reason (I probably didn't have any cash on me or something) I didn't pick this DVD up right then, but I plan to buy it ASAP. For some reason, this DVD just tickles my brain and imagination. It's very fun, and sort of intellectual at the same time!"
3,IT'S GOOD BUT.......,This is a great video. The graphics are sensational as is the sound.For the most part this is a full screen disc. Only 2 of the tracks are widescreen. Take note of this if you are using video projection via video projectors and have issues with full screen presentations and/or cropping run-off. Had I known this was how the disc was formatted I would not have bought it because everything I do is big screen projection in my basement at home. Now I am stuck to watching this only on my TV.It's a great disc to have if you don't mind the aspect ratio being full screen.
3,Need More dramatic music ...,"I am dissapointed because I bought this product to showcase my new HD set up! Well I should have known that this was not produced in HD and the picture would not do the TV justice. More so, I was expecting a lot better music. Really it would received 1 star from me , however what is great about this product is the computer animation! It looks really cool! I hope it is remade in HD with different music - perhaps classical or techno type .. little more to do with bass than just the treble end of the spectrum. More updated music is what I am thinking!"
3,Creative way to present the music. I don't think I'll buy the next version.,"After watching all tracks of this DVD in PBS, I instantly bought it. I liked watching it again. When I showed this to my friends thinking everyone will love it, they weren't impressed with it as much as I did. But then as mentioned by many in the review, my friend's kid was paying more attention.Will definitely play it for everyone that I know. I don't think I'll buy the next version though.Pipe dream is the best track and you can watch it over and over."
5,A Visualization of Sound,"It is impossible to not enjoy this DVD. It really is a visualization of sound. Other than that, all I can do is echo the million other reviews that highly praise this DVD."
5,Animusic 1,I think all pre school children should see this one its fantastic and will keep them thinking about music....kevin
5,What do you expect !!,"I challenge someone to find a mistake between the sounds & the visual. It's not a rock concert or Pink Floyd show. It's captivating, that's all.Why not leave it as it is, entertaining. ps Patiently waiting for III."
5,Love it!,"This is a great DVD. The music is great, the animation is awesome. The special features are fun, too. Great for music lovers AND computer nerds! :)"
5,Animusic is fun to watch again and again,This computer animation dvd is awesome in its detail. I do imagine to create for real such animation (animatronics maybe) like a new attraction in a park like Disneyland. The music is great and the fact that you can change your point of view is a plus. I wish it could be a bit longer.
3,Good for what it is!,"I first saw Animusic on a public radio station and was very intriqued by it! I bought this DVD thinking it would entertain me for longer than a PBS showing. It did...for a while! I guess the fantasy is that you're watching real machinery creating the sounds and music but then you realize it's just a cartoon and it gets old! Walt Disney would have been impressed with it's creativity! For anyone else, it's a cute cartoon!"
3,Animusic...Animazing!,"I saw this product in a store being played on one of their screens. I couldn't walk away.I had to stand there and watch the entire thing!Then I hunted down a sales person to tell me what I had been watching! They directed me to shop for it on Amazon.Now when we have people over,we have it playing to distract them while I put the finishing touches on dinner.Its always a hit and great ice breaker."
3,Animusic Antimusic?,"This computer animation is wildly imaginative, visually fascinating and musically dull. I like the drum machine for its precise coordination of visual and rhythmic elements but the balance of this DVD features music that is more elevator than elevating."
5,Totally Awsom!,I have given away four of these for Christmas to my adult children and they all thought it amazing.
4,"Clean Sound, nice mid bass.","Polk PA1100.5 powering these to the rears, Sl60's to the fronts.Clean sound that cranks, the 5"" x 8"" fits perfectly into my Mazdas (MS3) rear door speakers holes, would fit the same for the fronts if I wasn't using the sl60.Mid bass handles the power surprisingly well.Love them! Would defiantly recommend to anyone wanting a high quality sound., if you have the other components of your system up to par... ie: good clean HU alone, or a good HU matched w/ a clean amp.Gave it a 4 star instead of 5 star cause if you want a five star speaker, go with the Pro's, or a competition speaker.. Will cost you a lot more money."
5,good to go,a nifty and powerful little work that will assist you in increasing your powers of imagination and visualization. Great to load up in the backpack for a hike.
3,"More coast, less cold war please","I picked up this book based on the setting - a bookstore on the Oregon coast (a favorite of mine). And while the setting is integral to the plot, there is not much atmosphere in this book. Basically, this is a dated (written in 1973)piece. It is, if such a thing is possible, a Cold War cozy murder mystery. I like cozies and I like a good Cold War thriller (LeCarre, etc.) but for me this combination just didn't work. It lacks the cute and clever of an endearing cozy. Nor doesn't have the page turning suspense of a good Cold War thriller.Also, don't be fooled by the title -- the cat has almost nothing to do with the book. Cat mystery fans will have much more fun with the Lilian Jackson Braun/Rita Mae Brown/Carole Nelson Douglas series."
4,I love Conan Flagg!,"It's true the cat in the book has almost nothing to do with the main plot, it's not about the cat. It's about people in a small, sheltered town and their reactions to what's going on. Not to mention Conan's past, and the how gossip becomes a favorite pasttime. Who doesn't want to be Miss Dobie?! After I read this first novel of a series, I had to get the others!"
3,It's ok,I purchased it on line then found out I could have bought it cheaper at Home Depot.But that what I get for not looking around.
4,Great Replacement,This product was an excellent replacement for the alternator/power steering belt tensioner pulley on my 330 XI 2003 BMW. Delivery was prompt.
4,To Love and Protect Her,I received this product in a timely matter and in the condition stated. I will buy from Hippo Books again.
3,Parallel Bible,Unfortunately the print is to small for me to read. Will give it to a friend who has better eye site.
1,Horrible,"I was using this to see how the old KJV lined up with the new kjv. After awhile I noticed that some of the old kjv verses had been changed to make it line up with the nkjv. I was so mad. Here I was thinking wow, these line up almost exactly.WHAT IS THE POINT IN BUYING A OLD/NEW KJV PARALLEL BIBLE IF IT IS NOT EVEN THE OLD KING JAMES VERSION!If you want a good bible go to local church bible publishers. They have the best Bibles. Just type it into google. It will be the first thing that pops up."
2,Golden Box Review,the CD plays on all my CD playersbut the DVD plays only on my laptop; cannot play it in my BluRay player for TV; was a waste of money; buyer beware
3,Dunlop Ultimate Lemon Oil,"I bought this product as an add on to the most excellent Dunlop guitar maintenance kit. The product itself is excellent (e.g. the lemon oil). The problem I have is with the applicator. You remove the cap, and there is a wick for the lemon oil. I found you have to squeeze the bottle to get the oil to wick. There were not instructions specifying anything special except to shake the bottle - so I assume I am working the bottle correctly. I would prefer to just have an open bottle so I can apply the product to my own cloth for application."
5,Best guitar cleaning product out there,"This is the best cleaning product I've ever used. Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards, but I also use it on the headstock if it's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele. What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant, beautiful and lively tone. Really brings out the beauty of true wood. Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new. Application method is also very useful. I don't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards; I put it on my Stratocaster's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful. The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker. I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell (nowhere near overpowering), and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood. Great stuff. Go ahead and buy it."
4,A++,I have quite a few guitars and I like to keep them clean and polished. This stuff is great for my fretboard and I use it every time I change the strings.
5,Simply the best...,"These are a tad too large for some people. If you can handle the size, the cost/potency/value ratio is the best in the industry, bar-none. Highest potency, and a positive rating from Consumer Lab! *NOTE*: The photo is of the 50 softgels, not the 100. The item number DOES match the 100 softgel info on Solgar's website..."
2,"Decent product, poor support.","I own a Compaq Presario 5280. One of the big selling points for this camera was the built-in microphone. Installing the software was easy, as was setup, and I had no problem getting video (both moving and still) to work. However, after a series of calls to Compaq (24-hour, toll-free) and Logitech (9 to 5 Pacific time, toll call! ) we have not been able to get the built-in microphone to work. Logitech has been less-than-helpful in remedying the compatibility/driver issue with their microphone. I dug up a 12 year-old stand-alone mic and plugged it in for audio instead. I don't know if this issue extends to other models of computer, but if you have a Compaq, I recommend getting a Logitech web-cam without a built-in microphone, or just purchasing a different brand of camera altogether."
3,You get what you pay for review!,"If your low on cash,this is the camera for you,it works,but has some problems at times,it captures images very well,getting it to find your default email program like Outlook in Windows 98 is always a maybe,Check for updates aftr you brush your teeth each day!At least brush your teeth!You'll look nicer on your camera!If you find some money spend a few extra bucks for a better Logitech Camera;Don't forget to floss!WC"
2,thanks paul,"seen clips, but decided its a waste if its that retarted headache inducing ADD editing, iots too bad , they are a great band, but that type of editing ruins everything, after all this is VISUAL"
3,"Dense foam, slightly small for olympic bars.","The foam on this is nice, as is the soft-touch alcantara-like covering. However, it is just a little too small to close around an olympic bar."
2,Lost in an unfortunately live language,"oh, mr siegel, where is your editor, and why must you insist on ruining perfectly interesting characters with meaningless reflection, soporific tangents, and, the worst offense of all, tom robbins-like cutesiness. Stick to the darkness, the bottle, the raw sex-leave the clever-than-thou schtick to the wanna be modernists. What a waste"
1,DEFINITELY NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS A GOOD STORY,"Since this book's publisher (University of Chicago Press)calls this ""A Romance,"" I had started the book with the expectations that it would be a good story. No. There is hardly a story there. What the reader gets is a jumbo of words and semi-stream of consciousness mixed in with half-baked scholarship. The fact that the author cast himself as a character of the book is very revealing -- he is in love with himself."
1,Boring,"An elaborately failed takeoff on ""Lolita."" In an attempt to satirize the academic world that spawned ""Lolita,"" the author has produced a pastiche of the scholarly study. Unfortunately, the pastiche turned into an overblown burlesque, complete with mind-numbing footnotes, whole pages printed in italics and an entire chapter printed in red, upside down and backwards. A wonderful example of a writer trying too hard and succeeding at nothing but the induction of ennui."
5,Fantastic.,"Witty, erudite and great fun though clearly not for everyone. Helps to have some familiarity with India, Nabokov and the rest of Siegel's loves - if you miss the context you aren't going to enjoy it as much as you should."
1,Boring is right!,"Read the review of this book published in Kirkus Review (2-15-99) which was deleted from this site and you will know why I don't recommend this book. I have also read, or more appropriately, tried to read Siegel's other novel CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT. I managed only 3 pages, just couldn't hold the interest."
2,a poor second fiddle to Nabokov,"I don't mean to insult Siegel -- I liked his academic parady and did find parts of the book to be very funny. It's just that once you've read Nabokov's masterpiece, Pale Fire, you see how much better Nabokov was at that kind of parody. It almost seems that Siegel copies Nabokov a bit too closely. Parts of this book were just poorly done, but it had enough to make it worth reading if you enjoy academic spoofs. If you liked this book at all, you must read Pale Fire."
1,Give me a break!,"Mr. Siegel is so in love with his own words that he sacrificed the story to make room to show off his vocabulary. Don't buy this book if you want a love story. Don't buy this book if you want to learn something about India. Don't buy this book, period."
2,seeds too hard to chew,"not what I thought it was on the advertisement, figured it would be easy to eat in juices but it's not."
5,Compass Booster is Awesome,We have 2 of these for my husbands car and they are so great! Very lightweight and easy to moe from car to car. My boys love to have their own cup holders and this one has one on each side. I recommend this to everyone! Haven't been on an airplane but looks easy to check in our carry on the plan since it folds in half!
5,Excellent choice,"I use this booster for my 3 yr old dtr, and we love it! It is so light and easy to use, and folds up for easy traveling (along with the travel bag). It is sturdy and makes me feel she is very safe. I would highly recommend it."
5,Better than Britax,I have to say I am impressed with this seat and my son loves to get in his seat like a big boy and it does not hurt his tiny bottom and he feels like Mom and Dad with the armrest. I have only owned Britax seats and I made a change for this one and I am so glad that I did. It is worth every dime. Very lightweight and easy to use even Grandparents can figure it out without our help.
5,Great booster seat,"We recently decided to move our daughter up to a booster seat from a convertible Car seat. I looked around and this had the best reviews, I now know why! This is a great seat! My daughter loves it, she feels comfortable and loves the drink holders and arm rests. I really wish we had moved into this about three months earlier as we had made a couple of trips and rented cars each time. Car rental car seats are a rip off. They are convienent, but not comfortable, often hard to install (they never installed them for us)and in a matter of days you have paid . One time we packed up our seat and sent it as checked baggage, what a headach. This folds easily and sets up in a second. Would I buy it again, YES! in fact I am thinking of getting another for our other vehicle, so we don't have to swap it out."
5,Keep the heat coming...,"Believe me when I say, this is so far THE best book of this series. I have read all of them and this book kept me on my toes. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. It's just that good. I promise. I love the way a little bit more of everyone's motives are revealed in each book. It's always some kind of twist. And that makes for very good reading."
3,Dissapointed,I love these books and I am completley addicted to them. This book was dissapointing however. Gaia has gotten soft. I much prefer the earliar books. I also think that the love triangle should get straightened out. And the bedhopping needs to stop.
1,Caution: This did not download for me,I recently tried to purchase this book from my kindle and the book did not even download. I have tried repeatedly to try and download the full book but with no use. Be careful before purchasing this book. The information page states that this book is 227 pages long and my kindle did not even download the actual story just the information about the next book in the series. Overall the rest of the series has been entertaining but this fake download that still costs as much as the whole book is unacceptable. If I could rate a zero I would have.
4,Just when Gaia's life starts to get good...,"With Mary putting down her drugs, Gaia finally has a friend she can trust beside Ed. So when things start looking up for Gaia you know somethings going to happen to have it all crash back down again. This book is another great addition to the series, though it's not as good as the last, it's a great read. I just gotta warn fans of the series, the ending is very sad. But it's still a good one."
1,Skip It!,"I've really liked the books in the Fearless series, but this one really disturbed me. It was a big disappointment because I couldn't wait for it to come out. It was a REAL downer. The other books were semi-violent, I mean the series IS about someone who beats up criminals, but this one is VERY violent and graphic. As for the characters, Sam is no longer on my list of favorite people. Let's hope he redeems himself! If I were you, I would skip this book and spare yourself the gory details. Just wait for the next book to come out. It will probably fill you in with the details."
2,Serta Memory Foam Pillow,I did not find the meory foam feature any more useful than the run of the mill stuff.
1,buy the compilation instead,"The book is good other than some lame dialogs from Miles that seem half-thought through. I give the book 4 stars. Don't buy it, however, as you can get Cetaganda + two next installments for the same price in Miles, Mystery, & Mayhem."
4,"Beauty, brains, pranks, and danger ...","Miles and Ivan are the Barrayarian envoys to the funeral of the Cetagandian Empress. They barely reach the transfer station above Cetaganda when they are boarded and attacked...or are they. From this minor incident, Miles finds himself in the middle of intrigue that could kill him, cause Barrayar to be plunged into war, and destabilize the Cetagandan Empire. Moreover, Miles also learns that Barrayar's intelligence network is not always seeing the world as it is as he learns that the haut women of Cetaganda are more than merely decorative beauties in a bubble.There's non-stop action as the tensions build and the plot thickens. We learn more about Ivan and Miles and their interactions with others. It's the usual Bujold book filled with action, adventure, well-drawn characters, and told with wit and humor."
3,This comical entree shows a different side of Bujold,"Although not one of my favorite Bujold novels, Cetaganda is still worth reading. Following the epic Mirror Dance, I felt let down by Cetaganda. When comparing this book with the Mountains of Morning we can see the variety in Bujold's works. Ivan gets to become a fully developed character in this story, but the Dendarii are missing."
3,Do not read as your first Bujold novel,"The best reason to read this book is if you're Vorkosigan mad and need to read more about Miles or the people around him. If you don't understand what I mean by this, go back and read Cordelia's Honor (omnibus of Shards of Honor and Barrayar) and/or Young Miles (omnibus of The Warrior's Apprentice and The Vor Game).This book isn't quite Bujold Minor as it does flesh out the Cetagandan culture, but it's not one of her masterpieces, hence three stars instead of four. In a way it was practice in fantastic world-building for Bujold as the wonderous, if slightly contrived, construction of Cetaganda is a prelude to the development of Chalion and the Quintarian religion."
2,"WRONG PICTURE, WRONG SIZE",I ordered this product thinking it was going to be 1 gallon since the picture show a gallon. When I looked for the information on this product it does not say what size it is. When I recieved the product it is only a 1 quart. If I would have known I would have order the other the seaweed from a different site. Plus the s/h was the same amount as the product. Next time I will order from a the other site instead since that site is 1 gallon not 1 quart. Now I know!
2,Impossible to find Pfilters,"I went to my local Home Depot where i purchased my Sink, Faucet, and Countertop. I also bought 2 extra filters for when they needed changing. Well now i went back to the store and i cant find them anywhere. And it has been hell trying to find them online. Pfister Pfaucet Pfilter. pf**ed."
4,A nice upgrade for the kitchen,"I am very satisfied with this faucet, easy installation, good looking, and the filter feature is easy to use. The action is crisp, and there is no leaking whatsoever. The spout is long and high, giving lots of clearance for pots and pans. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is I'vs only had it for a week."
1,Poor Customer Service,Faucet has defective cartridge and water leaks under sink until cartridge is replaced. Takes Price Pfister 7 to 10 days to send you a new one unless you want to pay for over night shipping.
1,"Garbage, don't buy unless you enjoy changing your headlamps often","Car: 2005 Honda Accord 2.4L sedanOriginal bulbs lasted approximately 6 years. When the driver's side headlamp burned out, I swapped the burnt-out bulb and the other for these over priced pieced of crap. After about 4 months, the first bulb died. Bought a second pack and only replaced the bad bulb (I thought it may have just been a factory dud). 2 months later, another burnt out. I won't be buying these again.Edit: I've noticed that some reviewers have better life from the bulbs when turning off the auto-on feature in their vehicle. My Accord doesn't have that feature, and my bulbs still burnt out too quickly in my opinion."
4,Huh?,"Well, in the description it says ""lasts longer"", but when you get the lights, it says the life of the bulb is reduced, due to higher output...um...who is the idiot here?"
3,Not a twin pack,"Just note that I did not receive a twin pack like the title says. It appears this product is, in fact, a single pack. You will have to order two. The title is a bit misleading, so just beware."
4,Bulb Burn-Out Issue Solved (For Me)!,For several years I was having a problem with the Sylvania Silverstar bulbs burning out every 6 to 12 months. I loved the light so much that I tolerated it and replaced them with the same bulb.I was using the practice of letting the Camry turn the lights on automatically with a turn of the ignition key. The process was (1) lights turn on (2) engine starts. I could see the lights flutter a little during the starting process.I then experimented by manually turning on the lights AFTER the car was started. It has now been 2 years with NO BULB BURNOUTS. I believe turning the ignition with the lights already in auto on creates extra wear and tear resulting in more frequent burn-outs.
1,Expensive hype,"I fell for the hype and it was a mistake. Other reviewers will no doubt agree that these are short-lived bulbs and there is a reason for this. These bulbs are colored blue to *simulate* the HID look. Any color on the glass actually reduces output, so Sylvania uses an over-rated filament to get brighter light to compensate for the light absorbed by the coloring. Because federal laws are very specific about the output of headlights, Sylvania cannot use a filament that draws more current so the filament is burning overly hot and therefore has a shorter life. They same seems true for their uncolored X-Tra Vision bulbs. (Which may be the Silverstars without the color.) I tried those and they both burned out in less than a year, two weeks apart.I too have switched to GE bulbs and hope their bulbs are more durable."
4,"Not HIDs, but they're up there....","So I threw some of these in my 300zx, and man, they're crispy. They aren't 'brighter' per say, but they are MUCH cleaner as for as illumination. This does make it easier to see further out, but I don't think the lumens are different (OEM). As far as them burning out quickly, idk, but I have a really good idea that most of these people reviewing any of these halogens probably don't realize you can't touch the bulb.... it ruins them because of the oils. There really isn't much of a 'blue tint' that some reviewers are talking about- there is somewhat of newton circles on the film, but you can only see it under artificial sunlight (CFLs and florescents), but i doubt this has much to do with the crisp output- it just seems to be a more pure light imo. If you're wanting a blue hId like light, then you probably don't want these at all, but these are a daylight 4k color."
2,Burned out in 10 months,"I use these bulbs in a 2006 Scion Tc. I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased these. I have seen no positive reviews on the life of this product, here, from users who have had these bulbs for more than a year. Sure they are great when you first put them in. I had mine for approximately 10 months and both went out within a month of each other. Since my wife had already purchased one replacement I will buy one more. I will take the suggestion and not have the lights turn on when the car starts as well."
1,Murder Music,"If you like homophobic murder, you'll love Buju Banton's track Boom Bye Bye, which advocates pouring acid on a [...] man's head."
3,Unique music to a unique movie,"Carter Burwell, best known to soundtrack fans as the composer to the Coen Brothers, here creates strange, yet pleasant music that fits perfectly with Spike Jonze's brilliant yet bizarre film. I'm not a big Bjork fan, so the opening and closing songs aren't my favorites. I do love the excerpt from Bartok's ""Music for String, Percussion and Celesta""."
5,Perfect companion DVD to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,This DVD is a perfect companion to the Wallace & Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit DVD!It is essentially an EXTRAS DVD with:ALL 10 CRACKING CONTRAPTIONS in Widescreen.The Making of The Curse of the Were-RabbitThe Amazing World of Wallace & Gromitand there is also a short feature of Gromit's favorite scenes of The Curse of the Were-Rabbitand much more
4,Love this series!,"They're very cute and simple. Charming would have to be the word I'd use. Just the thing to attract the attention of a baby or toddler.Can't recommend them enough :)This one is funnier than most, though I can't say why.I will say that after several books (and several readings of each book), one starts to notice how formulaic they are. But that's all right. Children like predictable things."
3,Not as good as others,"My 3 year old has loved Dunrea's other books. This book, in my opinion, is not as charming as Peedie, Goosie, and the others. Part of that may be because it involves burping. Older kids may like the humor of it, but my daughter typically does not go for this one. I would recommend Peedie, Gossie, or Gossie and Gertie over this one."
2,BEWARE of Misprint (May 2011)!,"I recently bought the full set of Dunrea's Gossie and friends board books from Amazon. As I sat down with my 15 month old yesterday and starting reading him ""BooBoo"" we were off to a good start. The ""good food"" chorus seemed quite funny and cute...a solid 4 star book...until the last page. I am wondering how the book will end only to get to a misprinted last page! After reading about BooBoo ""who likes to eat"", the book ends with Peedie ""who forgets things"" - and is actually the last page of the Peedie book. Boooo.So now I either go through the hoops of returning the book or I glue the last page down to the back cover to avoid a confusing ending.My recommendation to potential buyers: Buy it from a store and check the last page for BooBoo instead of Peedie. I'm sure there is just a small subset with this misprint but I'm not sure I'd want to risk it and possibily deal with the hassel a return."
2,Toom simple,"The graphic is simple, while the description is simple too. This is not a story book with a plot. This is just some word uttering. My 2-year-old daughter quickly lost her interest in this book."
5,Fun books for kids,"I'm not sure why BooBoo is blue, but I liked him. All of these little goslings are just lovable. My grand daughter enjoys the little problems they have and can identify with them. These are very cute books for small children. The illustrations are adorable, which is why I picked the first one up. But the simple text keeps the child engaged."
3,Steady and Smooth but Heart Rate Monitor Has Bugs,"This machine was easy to assemble and took less than 90 minutes to put together by myself.The machine is heavy-duty and the action is very smooth while offering effective resistance for a good workout. This machine is also very quite with very little noise.I bought this model because it has heart-rate sensors on the handlebars which is a very big benefit when trying to burn fat effectively.Unfortunitely, the heart-rate sensors do not keep accurate track of my heart rate. While gripping the handlebars during my workout, the heart rate read-out stays in the 80's range, even while my heart rate exceeds 120 BPM (beats per minute), even after adjusting my hand grip to several different positions, the heart rate was still not reading properly.Overall a good machine but if your serious about burning fat, go with a better name brand so that the heart rate sensors work correctly."
5,Merit 720E Excellent Workout,The Merit 720 E Elliptical Trainer has various levels and it really gives you a great workout. The whole family really enjoys it!
4,Great!,"If you're like me, you get tired of looking in and out through the whole Bible for specific verses that pertain to exactly what you're going through at the time. I found this book at a local Christian book store and decided to buy it. I had just read the Jesus Freaks book and loved it, so I figured DC Talk knew what they were talking about (no pun intended hahahaha). It's a great book to carry around and look up that special verse that just speaks to you like no other!"
3,good theme based guide,I've been using this book as a devotional everyday reading the entire chapter of each verse listed. I like how it changes up the translations.
5,This Book Is Way Cool,Taking the Arthur series a step farther and upping it to this format was a great idea. These books are terrific.
5,Great,"Great stuff. Marlon Brando hows his verstality perfectly. Expecially noteworthy are Street Car named Desire, August Moon Tea House. The other two are also excellent."
3,Tea House of the August Moon,"I bought this for this one movie - Bramdo is great in the part. Who knew that ""thinking make man wise""?"
5,"Marlon Brando & ""STELLA!""",Four of Brando's films together; I knew I couldn't go wrong with this purchase. Brando was one of the greats.
1,BEWARE...DISCS ARE DUAL LAYER,Please be sure your DVD player will play dual layer format before ordering. Amazon has been asked to begin adding this information to the listings. My 3 DVD players won't play dual layer and it's an ugly surprise for me to receive these kinds of discs.The movies are undoubtedly wonderful...but only if playable.[ASIN:B004H83ILY TCM Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire / Julius Caesar / The Teahouse of the August Moon / Reflections in a Golden Eye)]]
5,Brilliant Komeda Soundtracks Double Feature,"This CD contains the complete Krzystof Komeda soundtracks for two of Roman Polanski's best films, ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Fearless Vampire Killers or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck."" There are 41 tracks with over 62 minutes. The Power Bros. Records label is presented by Zofia Komeda as Volume 12. I originally thought when I ordered this rather cheaply that it would be coming from Poland, but it was shipped in a matter of days domestically. It's a great bargain, with interesting liner notes and also a reproduction of the original manuscript of the music for the""Rosemary's Baby"" lullaby, ""Sleep Safe and Warm."" It would be hard to not want to buy the other volumes."
5,Dolce Indeed!,"Some things in life are absolutely *certain*. Some of these certainties are even good things, like Nino Rota's imagination and virtuosity!La Dolce Vita is an indespensible piece of music for those who wish to be transported backward, upward, into the heart of Fellini's Italia...Let your own imagination wander to another place...buy this."
5,Haunting,"This movie and soundtrack have been favorites of mine for going on 15 years now....it's hard to describe it if you haven't seen and heard it. Best to rent the movie and decide for yourself. Suffice to say, this is one of the best CDs to float away too,be it sleep or your imagination. Timeless."
5,Love it!,"This tank light fits my 2.5 baby fry tank extremely well! I love it! I use the Aqueon brand ""Colormax"" color enhancing mini compact florescent (for saving power and better lighting) bulb ( 6""L; 10 watt lamp) and it works beautifully! The colors are extremely vibrant in the tank and I don't mind that it has a turn style black knob on the side. This also comes with a little strip ""stand"" thing (not sure what to call it"" that's a few inches long (it that), to hold the light in place. Make sure you figure out where you want it before gluing it, and I guess I was too impatient for mine to let the adhesive (comes already on the ""stand"") completly set, so mine ended up sliding, but this won't happen if you let it set like the instructions say. haha! oops? ;)"
5,Loved it!,"I love Francine Rivers, I have read several of her books and have loved everyone of them! A must read."
3,Exodus Story,This book follows so closely along with the Book of Moses so that if you have read it then it is sort of repetitive.
4,A good biblical story,"Once again Francine Rivers captures us with Aaron, whom for most of his life lived in the shadow of his brother Moses. God raised Aaron up to become his spokesman and a key figure in freeing the Hebrews from Pharaoh. It book was good and is a picture of God's grace, but it does get lengthy and wordy during the plagues.Towards the end I began to lose some interest. This could be in part because I was already familiar with the Bible story."
4,Understanding the people in the Bible,"I loved this little book because it gave me insight into the life of Aaron and his brother Moes; allowing me to see the heart of God toward His people. The book is an easy read, but its insights will stay with you forever."
3,"pretty, but not pristine","I'm an amatuer woodworker and this is my first serious cabinet saw. So read this review with a grain of salt.This beauty arrived today and I'm very happy with its appearance. I've used them in others' shop and look forward to using it in my own. So far I've not had the chance to use it since I'm still wiring up the shop. Next weekend.The saw was very easy to assemble and getting a table perfectly flat with a quality straight edge was quite easy. However, the table had rust on it when it arrived. Plastic sheets lined with oil were set over the table during shipping to protect it from rust. Some parts of the plastic were dry with no oil on them. Under this some rust had built up. The rust cleaned up with a bit of elbow grease; but, I expected a pristine table to arrive.I'll add more to the review when the shop is wired and I can actually use the saw."
2,A low budget foreign film trading on Julie Christie's popularity,"I bought this film because of Julie Christie, and like many of the films from the middle part of her career, was disappointed by her only brief appearance. There is not much to this film, beyond a few subplots involving car racing and a young man and his father in love with the same woman (Christie). I can empathize, but there are no remarkable or even slightly memorable performances, and the thin plot ends without really resolving anything. I take any opportunity I have to watch Julie Christie, but this film was unsatisfying in every aspect."
5,she does use jelly,"this was my first lips album and it is amazing....you need to get this ""some what"" old school lips...."
1,Disappointing Quality!,"When we received the crown, two ""jewels"" had already fallen off. The quality seems more appropriate for display only, not for playing. It doesn't stay on the doll's head unless you hold it there or keep the doll perfectly still. The pieces that hold the ""jewels"" bend very easily, so I can't see it lasting long. We've had it one day, and it's going back. It's pretty, just not at all practical for a little girl and her doll."
4,Very good book !,It is a necessary text for anyone practicing cardiac anesthesia.I recommend it!It contains clear and updated knowledge in the field of daily practice.
4,good service,I returned the previously bought necklace two months ago. I've got a full refund for my purchase promptly. The service in both cases was good. I would suggest to put the jewelry of such cost in a better box.
5,A Must Have for English Teachers,"I discovered Hooked on English while searching for Grammar Grabbers (a book I'd seen several coworkers using). I was hoping for something a bit more ""hearty"" than the contents of the latter. I had used materials from it and found them often wrong or weak in various areas. Hooked on English has been a successful alternative. My students love the crossword puzzels for symbolism and literary elements. I heard many exclamations from my juniors ""this is fun!"" The exercises for writing ideas and organization are useful and kept my students engaged - and believe me, I have a tough crowd to please! I recommend this for warm-up practice and reviewing especially at the high school level."
3,Good for review,This book is a good back-up if you don't have a quality text book to use. I wish it broke the lessons down into grade-appropriate categories. It's okay. Worth the money.
4,Chock full of ideas,Just got this book for Christmas. What a wonderful book! It's full of ideas and techniques. (Ignore the editorial review. He didn't get far enough to notice that there is a glossary for terms you may not have heard before.) Part of what makes this book so good is it explores WAY beyond the standard head and figure scultures. Highly recommended!
2,Blah,I bought this as it was a required text for my pottery class. I don't know why. It is a simple and rather dull book about working with clay. The sample pieces are rather uninspiring and the information is just run of the mill. I'd look elsewhere for true artistic inspiration and skill building.
5,Excellent Mustang history,"Gave the book as Xmas present to recent Mustang owner. He was extremely pleased, gave him great insights into the design of the car."
1,Not Deadly on the facts,"Good quality product.The story however is filled with many inaccuracies and just plain lies for dramatic effect and stereotyping. Film is centered mostly around one of the heroes Rimiro Martinez,one of the Police Officers who was a real life hero of the incident. Facts about what really happened are loosely based or not fully explored. Racism is implied regarding Martinez not being promoted. The real Martinez denounced the depiction as false. This lie was put in for dramatic effect. If you want to get the real story, get the book, ""A Sniper in the Tower"" by Gary Lavergne. Mr. Lavergne and his book have been profiled on both the History and Discovery Channel as the definitive book on the incident."
4,Deadly Tower DVD,Hard to find classic DVD and well worth it. They don't show classic movies like The Deadly Tower anymore on television so it's nice to know I can find just about anything on Amazon.com. The Deadly Tower is just as thrilling as I remember. DVD arrived in great condition in just a few days and I will order more DVD's in the future.
4,completely satisfied,"received ""the deadly tower""when promised & was pleased with the quality for a tv movie! video was very good but the audio was even better...you could really hear those rifle shots like you were right there! this is not a ""feel good""film but a fairly accurate description of a tragic event! kurt russel is outstanding as the troubled sniper( i believe his first dramatic role)! in a nutshell:very entertaining 90min."
3,Entertaining but lacking,"The biggest problem I had was that I went to college at LSU, so to ignore the fact that it is the state capitol tower was pretty impossible. I understand the reasons behind filming there. Whitman's character could have used a lot more development, another important note. As a made for TV movie for the general masses however, it does work however historically inaccurate it may be. In light of recent school shootings, this is a relic worth checking out as it is the last if its kind. If only Whitman's life had been explored more. I was just as interested if not more so about the person and not just the sensationalism of the act. Although Kurt Russell does well in a minimal performance in his first adult role, Ned Beatty shines more as a supporting actor in the little screen time he does have."
1,Nothing Memorable,"I got this book based on all the wonderful reveiws here. I guess I did not get what was so great about this book. The herione of the book Jenna is what turned me off of the book. She couldn't let go of the past! She held a grudge against the hero Adam through the whole book, and it got very tiring reading how much she hates him for breaking up with her to go to college. Her son Ryan is a joy in the book and his relationship with Adam is great, but it wasn't enough to put me back on to the story. I sort of wished that Adam ended up with Cheryl, his co-worker who liked him."
5,Amazing,"Buy this, and let Lamb of God, Killswitch Enagage and HIM quit selling cd's. Oh yeah Im 18 not 13. Thanks."
1,Comments on content,The description needs to be rewritten to clarify that this is simply a compilation of schematics with little other information.
2,Not much here of interest,I didn't realize that this is just a collection of ships schematics. There are no detail drawings. There is no other information in this book. The preview of this book shows the only page with an actual drawing of a ship. Unless you have a fascination for waterline drawings of ships find another book.
4,Useful,"As a person in recovery I found many of the topics useful. Those in recovery would agree that as individuals there is not a ""cookie cutter' method that works for everyone. We need to develope a toolbox for not only the now but the future as well. This book offers suggestions not found in mainstream gatherings. Good Job!"
2,Poorly done,"I would have thought this would be a great production. Should'a started with booming bass and great licks...but terrible grainy footage, not even artsy...just crumby. My eyes still hurt. Couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. Yeah, I'll go back and watch the whole thing, but I'm not jumping at it."
2,Not so great,"Fresh out of the box, it was very nice looking. Everything was crisp and felt like a durable cover. It has been 1 month and 3 days since I put it on my bike and it has already begun to fade at a rapid pace. I knew it wasn't waterproof but according to some reviews it does a decent job at keeping the water out... it happened to lightly rain briefly in LA for about 25mins and the bike was soaked. I should have spent the extra money for the waterproof one. I don't see it lasting more than a year."
4,Good fit for my bike,"got this for my '03 Shadow ace with a 21"" windshield and back rest. Fits over the bike entirely and is of good construction. Would not be practical for traveling due to space it would take up in Saddle Bags."
1,Poor quality control,I just opened the package and I discovered a ripped hole in the center of the cover. Now it's definately not water proof.
2,"Works for the first month, after that it fell apart","I bought this cover to protect my harley 1200 sportster. It worked well for the first month, but it quickly developed holes all over. Also, the hooks you use to attach it to the bottom of your bike both fell off pretty quickly.I kept my bike outdoors, and it rarely rained of was windy. I was careful putting it on an off. Now the cover is riddled with holes and is pretty much useless.I would not recommend this bag for larger bikes like mine. It seems if the cover is under any stress it will rip and tear."
3,VERY tight on a Goldwing!,"First impression out of the box is that this is a well-made motorcycle cover. It feels heavy, and looks like it will stand up against the elements for a long time. That said, the Touring size is a very tight fit on my stock 2000 Goldwing 1500 SE. I'm afraid it may be too tight as it is snugged up on the corners of my trunk, which could easily scratch the paint or abrade it off. Hopefully the fabric will relax a bit and give it some ""play"" on the corners."
2,Beware ! Product has changed,"Over the past two years, I've purchased and happily used the motogear deluxe cruiser cover on my last two bikes. It was reasonably priced, large, and well made, with several fabric panels. When I sold my bikes, the covers went with them. So, imagine my disappointment when, for bike number three, I received my new motogear delux cruiser cover - same specs, same product name, same label - and found that the cover was significantly smaller and more cheaply made than previously. It's nowhere near the product it was in the past. Ah well, nothing stays the same."
5,Grey cover,"The cover was very well made. Quality materials that protected from rain, sun, all weather. Easy to put on and take off."
3,"Unnecessarily complex, but contains useful information","If you need to know about this subject, it pays to find the best source. This was the best I found until I came acrossDiagnosis: Heart Disease: Answers to Your Questions about Recovery and Lasting Healthby John W. Farquhar and Gene A. Spiller, which presents more information in fewer pages and a lot more clearly.ICON Publications publishes some excellent books on specific diseases, includingHeart Bypass Surgery: A Medical Dictionary, Bibliography, And Annotated Research Guide To Internet ReferencesandHeart Valve Surgery: A Medical Dictionary, Bibliography, And Annotated Research Guide To Internet References.Also, Dr. Vincent Gaudiani, a noted heart surgeoun, has put together some excellent tutorials on heart surgery that appear on youtube. Search under ""Vincent Gaudiani"" and ""heart surgery""."
5,This is better than the Hollywood Hardcore Diaries!!,"Micky Skee has done it again, he's been able to sustain some pretty incredible unbelievably bizarre sex acts. The classes in the college itself are hysterical,[]The Naked Dorm is the best, sign me up! I'm a college guy who has had similar experiences of guys just ""hanging out"" at the dorm naked and then blowing off a bit of steam, and Micky seems like he was there watching us.I highly recommend this book as a sequel to his [] Hardcore Diaries...keep 'em coming!"
3,"Fun, For Now","F.U. was fun to read. Though not so much on an intellectual level, among other things. It was fun, it was clean, and crisp.Not much more."
1,not worth it!!!,This toy broke the first night and before it broke all the components were not working.
1,It Just Doesn't Work!,"I bought this for our daughter's first birthday as she loves tub time. It worked for about 3 seconds the first time and then didn't for several weeks until the entire bottom portion got wet, then it mysteriously started working. It never works on the single mode, but will on the ""orchestral"" mode where the whole band plays, but the entire band plays only if the bottom of the toy is wet (hey, that's not in the directions). Of course, it ALWAYS works when I take a shower.Should have read the reviews first."
1,Purchased Twice....Both Defective,"I'm always looking for good bathtime diversions and purchased this toy last month. My toddler boys seemed interested, though not enthralled, with it in the short period of time before it completely stopped working. I exchanged it for another and guess what? Same thing. Not exactly the highest quality toy."
3,A Fun Toy with a problem,We got this toy for my 9 month old for Christmas and he really likes the music it plays in the bath tub. The problem is that the volume is sometimes too soft to hear. I don't know if water is getting somewhere where it shouldn't and causing it to be quiet or something else is going on. Otherwise it's a fun toy for him and my 3 year old.
2,Do Not Buy this toy,This toy is not at all worth the money you spend on it. Like another reviewer I bought at Kohl's on a 1/2 price sale and am super glad that I did not pay full price. My 1 and 3 year olds were not impressed. It was fun for them for about 5 minutes and that was it. It goes in and out and plays when you don't want it to. After 5 minutes my kids were playing with their Dollar Tree plastic boats again. I believe toys should be fun and simple. This toy however is alot of work keeping the bubbles out and the water pools in the instruments prolonging the play. I would not recommend at all. Stay away from this one.
2,"Ehhhh - it is ok, but not that great.","We got this toy as a gift... and we are thankful for it... but it doesn't seem to always work. Aside from that, the colors are nice - and it drains as you pour into it - so aside from the music - it would have worked just fine for a basic activity toy... but darn, it would never stay on the tub. It's the suction cups. The toy is constantly falling down for us. It's probably just our tub or something - but it just keeps falling down."
2,Doesn't Work,This toy worked only while it was in the box. I think my son got it to play once after we set it up in the tub and that was it. :(
4,1 and 3 year old love this toy!,My two boys love this bath tub toy. The suction cups are fairly strong and hold up the toy except when my 1 year old pulls up to it and slides it down. They both love the music and enjoy pouring water into the funnels. It has certainly jazzed up our bath time.
3,Bath Toy,"This is such a cute toy with bright colors and plays several different songs. The suction cups work very well to hang it on the tub. When you pour the water over it, it plays a little tune. The only issue was the music didn't seem all that loud but it was something fun and different for the kids to use in the tub."
1,Don't bother,"I absolutely agree with most of the reviews: this toy is a cute idea, but the fun doesn't last. I haven't been able to get it to work now for several months. Haven't tried cleaning the contacts though. But, I'm not sure it's worth fixing because my girls lost interest in it fairly quickly -- especially since the music playing was sporadic."
1,Never worked,"Little Tikes Bathtime BandI purchased this time for my two toddlers for Christmas. It looked so cute and my 15 month old loves music. It was going to be a surefire hit. Unfortunately it has never worked. We tried new batteries, pouring water simultaneuosly in the cups, one at a time, nothing has worked. As it was Xmas morning, the box is long gone. I wish we had read the reviews. Do not buy this toy unless you want some realy disappointed kids."
1,Worst toy..pls do not buy!!,It almost could have hit my baby's head . the suction of this toy is so bad it almost missed my baby's head while he was having his bath. i request Amazon to stop selling all Little Tikes toys.This is my 3 item of this brand i'm returning.
5,How can it get better than this?,"Scooter's music captured my attention the first time I heard it. Since then I have gone to several of his shows just to hear more. Every time I hear a new song by him I think that he won't be able to top it, but somehow he always does. Scooter's ""ancient rituals"" cd blows me away! His song ""Cold"" is heartwarming and ""One Conversation"" is excellent, I listen to it over and over! I can't wait to hear what else this artist has up his sleeve."
4,A great healthy option to brighten up a meal,"Amaranth is a great option for any meal. I fix it similar to quinoa or couscous. Add a few spices like garlic, black pepper, onion, and red pepper...yum"
3,Amaranth,Didnt reall like it . I know it suppose to good for you. But we all have our likes and dislike. The item came quickly. I would but from this seller again.
4,Great -- With Exceptions,"This classic bath soap is superb, but they never should have changed the shape from its original. You have to wonder what nitwit in product development or marketing came up with that bubble-headed idea. And I noticed that the 10-count package contains two fewer bars of soap than does the 12-count package. Some brilliant soap executive probably thought up that one."
4,Smoothe Gaming,if you need a little bigger of a PSX controller this is the perfect item to get i found it perfect for tekken 3 ultimate fighting championship as it didnt fit uncomfortably in my hand if you are a big time game fighting player this is a must have!!!!!
4,"Why so negative, it cost $... what did you expect!","We have about a $2 million service company with a little of everything and I have to tell you I love this product. I am not fooled by what it is and what it is not. I am sure if your business is complex you need to be somewhere else, but for small businesses that do not have exotic needs this package works ...period. I am constantly amazed by the features. Yes it is a fancy check book, but cash flow is where the information action is for smaller companies with out a lot of assets to worry about. Very nice invoicing, pretty good inventory if you have any (we don't). When I reconcile the check book we are never off by a penny, I like that.Don't think you are buying a system suited for GM or IBM or any complex asset intensive or complex billing type company. But for many of us out there with money in and money out it is great."
1,Keep Looking it is not Quicken,I have to wonder sometimes who writes these reviews as it seems more like company PR then truth sometimes.Not a flexible package and there are better packages. Intuit is not as helpful as they use to be and they even seem to have developed a little contempt for the customer.Not a happy customer.
3,Horrible support spoils a decent product,"I currently use QuickBooks Pro 2000. It's a good program overall. However, when you come across a problem that you can't solve, get out your credit card. You'll either have to pay Intuit ($) per year for a support contract or ($) plus ($) per minute for calls over 10 minutes. I have diligently searched through the Help menu, online knowledge base, message boards, and fax-on-demand, and I still have not found the answers to different problems. I guess I was naive to think they would provide all the answers for free when they can make more money on support contracts."
3,foreign import,This was a gfit for my husband...We heard Old Man River while visitng Italy and the songs just stick in your head. He loves it!
1,Sham-Sham the Flim-Flam man!,I would like to review the product but it never arrived. The seller never notified me of the delay and/or cancellation. He never even returned my emails. I guess we now know why his mama named him Tim Shady. Avoid this seller. Period.
5,Hikers Strike Gold!,"If you are planning a trip to northern Tuscany (Florence, Pisa, etc.) and want to do some hiking, you must check out this book! It is a goldmine of information on hikes in the Tuscan Alps -- all carefully described and ranked by difficulty, scenic beauty, elevation gain and duration, etc.-- as well as recommendations for places to eat and sleep at the end of your tiring day. I will update this review after putting the book to the test in May 2000."
4,Terrific Guidebook,"I just returned from a trip to the Apuan Alps, where I put this book to the test, and it was quite useful. The hikes are very well described and are very accurate in terms of the terrain and the time and distance. I also agree with their rankings of the various hikes in terms of difficulty and the overall experience. However, this book should be used as a ""starting point"" coupled with detailed road maps and trail maps, as the directions to the trailheads (and on the trails themselves) can be a bit vague at points. Still, it was an excellent tool that made for a great hiking experience."
5,More than Moms,"Grace Fox speaks to women in general in these succinct, well-written gems. Each day has a different scripture and interesting antecdotal tale to capture my interest and make me think. I found myself reading one selection to my 15 and 16 year old daughters just because the ideas for that day were relevant to their lives. Adding this short reading into my daily time with God brightens and clarifies my relationship with Him. I find that I'm looking forward each morning to this little ""Upward Glance"" as I approach the throne of God."
1,"Designer Whey ""Putty.""","It may have plenty of protein in it, but the Designer Whey French Vanilla flavor tastes awful. It takes a while to mix it up, because lumps form when mixed with water and they have to be manually broken up. The container is still sitting on my kitchen counter, only because I haven't gotten around to throwing it out."
1,I would return it if i could,"This taste terrible and upsets my stomach. Also, it gives me a little gas. I used to use this ages ago before they changed the formula and I can see the difference. I think that it is way toooo sweet now. Very overpowering, too many artificial sweeteners. I would not recommend this powder! I will be trying an unsweetened vegan plant protein next (soy or pea protein). I give up on the conventional mainstream proteins. They are over-processed, overpriced garbage. Don't waste your time or money and avoid this protein powder and those like it. I hope this review has helped you."
2,Can't get over the taste/texture,"It wasn't horrible, but I can't get over the taste (I got the french vanilla), compared to other brands I've had. It also doesn't mix well with drinks or yogurt; it clumps together unless you put it in a blender.Taste isn't huge for me, but I couldn't deal with this. It literally would make me cringe. I bought this after trying Met-Rx, which tasted soooo good, so it was really disappointing in comparison."
4,next nutrition designer whey protein,Great product - good taste. Arrived fast. Only complaint is that the scoop was not at the top and a lot spilled out when digging for the scoop but could have been the shipping process.
3,Okay,"This powder works okay, but I think syntha 6 gave better results, tasted better, and had a better consistency."
5,Finally! I found a great-tasting protein shake!,"I have purchased a couple different protein poweders from Hi-Health over the years and they still sit in my pantry because I cannot stand the bad taste they have! After reading all of these very positive reviews on Amazon regarding the taste, I purchased the size 2 Chocolate and since I had to wait a few days for it to be shipped to me, I ran down to Hi-Health and picked up 12.7 oz can because I wanted to try it sooner! I was a little scared because the smell of the powder reminded me of something burning...? lol... I mixed it with skim milk and couldn't believe how easily the powder blended in. I used my Starbuck's cup and just shaking the mixture worked out pretty nicely. And better yet, the taste was the best yet! I was expecting some nasty after taste or worse, but this tasted almost like a chocolate slimfast or a Carnation instant breakfast drink. YEAH! I've found something I can live with!!"
1,This whey sucks,"Dont buy this.worst tasting protein ever,makes me sick and also gives me stomach problems.I have used tons of brands and this is the worst tasting protein ever."
3,"good protein powder, flavor a bit lacking","Maybe it was b/c i tried the vanilla praline first, but this flavor is pretty bland. Great product though"
1,Ad is not what it seems,I order 4.4lbs of protein but I only got 4lbs....misleading ad. I have ordered this protein in 4.4 lbs before and this time I noticed the difference since the container was smaller then usual. I never had a problem with ordering stuff from amazon and this is my first complaint.... I didn't get what I ordered :(
2,French Vanilla is Gross,"I bought this protein because I read a lot of reviews saying that it is the best tasting protein powder available. I chose the French Vanilla flavor. I am very disappointed. It tastes terrible and leaves a slight aftertaste. When I included it in a shake with milk and fruit the taste was covered up, so that's what I'll be doing from now on. I do not know what their other flavors taste like. Also, there are 18 grams of protein in each scoop, which seems to be slightly on the low side. On a positive note, this protein mixes very well- no big clumps of powder floating around."
4,Agree with the other review,"Vanilla is unappetizing. It is chalky and does not mix well with milk or juice. Chocolate and strawberry have a sandy texture so they mix better, and they also taste better. I have also tried GNC's whey, but it has more cholesterol and fewer vitamins (especially the B's). The GNC vanilla tastes better though."
4,Worth of 4 Stars,"The Worthy is a fast-paced, often fluffy piece of fiction that grabs you quickly and won't let you go. The first-person account of a frat boy pledge's ghost (murdered by an older ""active"" in the frathouse during initiation rites) is often funny and often gruesome -- and it truly shows the cruel realities of life, even if seen through a dead man's eyes. The ending has a great twist, too."
5,A fun read,"I really enjoyed this book, it started off with a bang and never slowed down. I rarely read a book in one day but this was one of those books I couldn't put down. It's hard to believe it was written by a 26 year old young man. I'm a fan!"
5,THE LOVELY BONES meets ANIMAL HOUSE,"Bleeding edge novelist Will Clarke's sophomore effort is a literary tour de force, a non-stop ride from the gates of hell that is a Southern fraternity initiation to one man's redemption in a peculiar melange of revenge and other-worldly existence. When freshman Grady Tucker is brutally murdered by his debauched pledge trainer, he finds himself stuck between earth and the afterlife, a wraith with an attitude. There's hell to pay for those responsible as the dead man learns a few things about the meaning of life and comes to terms with his lack of a physical body. At times wickedly funny and always brutally honest, you will be disappointed if you miss this literary event. Also be sure to check out Clarke's first novel, LORD VISHNU'S LOVE HANDLES."
5,A Great Read!,"Quite a hard book to describe because it's unlike any I have ever read; it is absent of any predictable path. And that is the very best kind of book to read especially when it's written this well, with this much original imagination. It's a book you will not be able to put down and that fascinates because you do not know where it's going and if Clarke can conclude the suspense successfully, with the same level of imagination and unpredictability. That was the burning question in my mind...'how will the author end this?'...I wasn't disappointed. So I'll let you read it to find out for yourself, and then wonder like I do...who incarnates Will Clarke??!!"
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read,Take a goat in lingerie. Add a Whoopie Goldberg-like cook who can see dead people. Mix in some crazy LSU Frat boys and you have a recipe for a laugh-out-loud book that you won't be able to put down.I LOVED this novel. It's one of my favorites this year. Watch out for Will Clarke because you'll be hearing a lot from him in the future.
2,Disappointed after loving Lord Vishnu,"I really enjoyed Lord Vishnu's Love Handles, and immediately put The Worthy on my wish list. I just finished reading it and what a disappointment. It was interesting that the book was set at LSU, where I work, but aside from that, I almost had no reason to finish the book (exept tenacity). Each character was a cliche, except for the main character, who seemed to have no clear personality. Was I supposed to be shocked by deaths that were whimsical by plot standards? Hmmm....I just don't get it, I think Mr. Clarke is too talented to write something like this. Perhaps it was an old school project?"
5,A terrific guide for rural California backroad explorations!,"The spiral binding of this paperback may not make it accessible for library lending, but individuals seeking a family driving guide for backcountry California will find it wonderful. California Coastal Byways covers roads from the Oregon border to San Diego, focussing on the coastal Route 1 and offroad between this and 101. It's easy to look at the general map, choose a specific region, then read the different trip descriptions which include notes for car, bicycle and stops along the way, maps needed and how to get there. Highly recommended for any California resident or visitor who enjoys rural back roads explorations."
3,"Not as good as ""name"" brand, BUT...",This battery is NOT the same as the Sony NP-FC10 which is 3.6V 2.4Wh. The sent battery reads 3.7V 4.44Wh. ALTHOUGH-overall for its price it cannot be beat and works great for a backup battery. The battery life last about an hour.
1,Don't buy this Battery.,Battery is so hot and drained faster.Keep your money with reliable company and not with this Chineseboiling room.
1,"Bad, just last 3 months.","I purchased this battery around September 2011 to prepare for Holidays at the year end. It was going bad on Thanksgiving, November 2011 and totally dead on Christmas, December 2011. It just lasts about 3 months. It's not expensive but if you prepare for big occasions you may be very disappointed."
5,If only I had seen this book years ago,"When my mother was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, everything I read about it scared me out of my wits. I wish this balanced book had been available to instruct and encourage me and my family. This impressive guide is a refreshing antidote to the usual doom and gloom. If you wonder if a relative or friend may have the disease or if a diagnosis has recently been determined, this is a must read."
5,Perfect!,"This book covers absolutely everything you would want to know about caring for a person with Alzheimer's Disease. I really appreciated its combination of honesty tempered with kindness. It includes not only the author's considerable knowldege of the topic, but also the perspectives of victins of Alzheimer's as well as a host of different caregivers -- real people, all of them. When I read this book, I felt that it had covered every single one of the myriad conflicting emotions I feel every day in joining with my family to care for my father."
5,a godsend,"I know my family is going to benefit so much from this book. It has what we are looking for -- all types of basic information, about the disease itself and practical caregiving information, presented in a very calming manner. We are in the tricky situation of the affected family member's refusal to go to a doctor, so we don't even have a professional as a guide through this situation....not yet anyway. It is great to have Mr. Kuhn's experience and depth of knowledge, in an easy-to-read and comprehensive guide."
5,Good information,"I am always looking for information on dementia, since I provide training to community members and medical professionals about dementia. I was specifically looking for evidence based information on dementia and driving, since I provide driving assessments to older adults with dementia. I wanted to see what the authors said about driving with early stage dementia. They basically said what I found to be true- some people can continue to drive with early stage dementia, but some people are unable to drive safely even in the early stages. It shows that each person must be tested for driving safety, once they are diagnosed with any type of dementia, or even MCI."
4,There are only 3 picks......not 4,"These picks are great, however, there are only 3 picks in the package. When I told the company about that, they told me they would mail me another one..........that never happened.So, picks are great, seller, not so much."
5,Perfect book,"It is a perfect translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. It is very large book. But for people wanting to know the Samyutta Nikaya, is very good. And is a complete translation of it."
4,An extensive work,"I great translation of this relative dry book of Buddha's speeches rich in commentarial material. The author consistently translates Sankhara as 'Volitional formations', even when it is clear volition is not included, and thus subscribes to the three lives interpretation of the Paticcasammupada, but this seems to be the present general agreement rather then being a fault of this book."
2,better buy more specialized books,"This book is a good overview of the different visas available.However, it really skimps on details of applying for greencard & citizenship.In only one chapter, the many scenarios are all jumbled together, which causes me to be confused on which parts are relevant.I got much better detail from things on the internet. The author has other books that specifically focuses these topics, and they may be more useful."
3,Good for specific issues,I wanted this book to understand how a person with permanent residency can apply for and receive citizenship. I found the information a little lacking in this area. This book is better for someone who wants to understand how a perosnal can gain citizenship or residency from scratch.
4,Good resource,"With election season just around the corner (egads; already!) I decided to take the opportunity to educate myself on what's sure to be a hot issue - immigration. Frankly, I'd like to know some facts before I hear all the malarkey the pundits will say when cameras are rolling. This book isn't exactly a riveting read, but at least I feel like I'm getting some reliable information and have something in hand I can refer back to. I like to at least feel like I know a little something about an issue before picking sides and casting a vote. This book serves my purposes and I'm happy with it."
3,Seems great but be careful,"If you just read this book, it seems very helpful. The language is simpel, and the authors know what they are talking about. But the information regarding some forms is insufficient. An example: about form G325A the book says: ""The questions are self-explanatory."" But I have no idea what to fill in at ""File number A-"". File number? Same form says ""Submit all four pages of this form."" But the form in the book contains only one page. If you visit the INS website, you'll find four pages. But the INS nor this book explain what to do with two of the four pages after you filled in one for yourself and one for you relative. It would be nice if people who bought this book, got an opportunity to ask these simple questions on Nolo's website, but that doesn't seem possible. I'm afraid I need an immigration lawyer after all."
1,BEWARE! Kindle selling an old edition of this book,"If you buy the paperback edition, you will receive the new, 2011 ed. of a book which cites laws that change almost daily. The Kindle edition, however, is an old edition, citing laws which are no longer applicable to the immigration process."
5,Must read for any Immigrant,"If you are unfortunate enough (as I was for an immigrant), then do yourself a favor and read this book. It is an extensive book, but some section are repetitive (due to similar regulations for different visa categories). It will also help you deal more effectively with an attorney in immigration matters and avoid many of the legal traps that has ensnared my new immigrants. I wish I had this during my time going through the INS system. If you are reading this for research or non-immigration purposes it will give me an appreciation for what new immigrants have to go through. Good Book ."
4,New School Breaks Mastery,"First -this album is pretty old already and so not really interesting for people who need the latest mixes. Second - this is also not techno or stuff, but probably the most interesting dance in the last 6 years - nu-skool breaks. This album just rocks. It is a noisy, shaking tsunami of sound. Punk, rock, techno, hiphop. Just awesome. Especially Alex Dolby Hazy Way is probably my favorite dance anthem still. Very good running/work-out music...! However, Evil Nine never had great DJ skillz - but hey the songs are awesome and rock so smooth transitions are not necessary..."
1,Worst Breaks CD in the Y4K series,"This is by far the worst in the Y4K series. The song selection is poor, especially the double track of pearl-shot. Don't waste your money on this CD."
5,sweeeeet,it is a very very good mp3 player. some reasons it is better then other mp3s players are***** it has the title of the song and the name of the band on the display ***** it has all the funcotions of the others nut this one has a dbs setting that others dont which inckudes rock pop dance classical and others ***** it comes with head phones ***** it has cd quality sound and you can get the songs u want for free ***** it can do any thing a cd player can execpt with out skipping..**>><<**..
4,I need help decideing!,"I am trying to decide whether i want to buy a 32MB Yepp, a 32MB Lyra, a 32MB Pine D'Music, or a Audiovox MP1000. If u have any comments, good or bad or would like to recommend one please e-mail me at cashmoneybrada1@aol.com. It would be appreciated."
3,"Good Sound, Horrible Manual","After sitting at my computer for almost 4 hours figuring out all of the little extra steps you need to complete to get this thing to work, I was almost ready to give up and take it back. Finally I went online and downloaded a file just to see if it worked at all. It did. So I went back over the process again. I finally figured out the last of many crucial steps. So after you get your parallel port in ECP mode, after you make sure you're recording on your RealJukebox in MP3 mode, after you turn off the security block, you FINALLY get to hear some music. So little is covered in this manual, it serves as little more than shock insulation for the Yepp. I'm not a tech head, but I'm literate enough to have figured the details out on my own. If you're not savvy, or don't know someone who is.. Avoid this thing until you get help. But like I said, I'm happy with the sound and the ability to make custom listening in a tiny package.. If they fix the manual, this'll be a real winner."
4,"If You are Running Windows 95, get this MP3 Player!","Attention all Windows 95 users this is the MP3 Player you want. After a painful process of trying Diamond Rio and Odyssey (This is a real piece of crap!) I found Yepp. I could not get any MP3s to download to either the Odyssey or Diamond Rio running Windows 95. Yepp was simple and easy to install. My CD Player is frankly obsolete as I now use Yepp while running. Great sound (CD quality), extremely light, and no skipping since there are no moving parts. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the 32MB. This amounts to about 30-35 minutes of music. Acceptable, but 64MB would be more desirable."
4,Perfect for your lectures at school,"I bought my Yepp-32 just for my class. I recorded all my lectures and stored in my hard drive. I don't need to worry about buying tape at all. I can also make my class into diffrent chapters. I helped me so much on quoting what my professor has said. I think I have found my answer to improve my grades. If you visit the yepp website, the USB cable has just released. It can transfer your file at 1.3M/second, downloading a 5 minutes 128kbs song only take few seconds. IF, this player has a plug-in mic function, it would be perfect!"
4,Best for the money!,"I bought a digital recorder and did not like its voice quality . So while looking for the digital recorder, I came across Yepp's voice recording capability and ended up buying it.I'm very pleased with the product. It is small, lightweight and pleasent looking. In my openion, Manual is not very well written. The Jukebox software was not functioning well on my system. Yepp software which manages download and upload from the Yepp is simple once you know it(again, Samsung can add more text about how to do each operation which will greatly help users)."
3,Good Prop,"Good prop for Halloween for my 8 year old daughter. Had to hot glue many branches back together, though. As other reviewers have said, it began to fall apart right out of the box. Therefore, I could not let her play with it. I will put it in the attic in case she wants to be a witch again next year."
1,poor quality,"it looks nothing like what is in the picture. the bristles are skimpy, the handle is literally a cheap plastic broomstick that was cut in half:/"
2,Smaller than you think,This broom is smaller and had less bristles than expected. Looks pretty cheap especially to go with a witch costume.
4,Nice broomstick,We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old to go with her witch costume. It's a good prop for pictures but not something to let the kids play with because it will be destroyed haha. She didn't bring it along for trick or treating because that would just be too cumbersome but we got a lot of pictures with it and it can be saved for many Halloweens to come!
3,Nanny,"I ordered these brooms for my granddaughters who are planning on being witches for halloween. I thought they couldn't possibly be witches without brooms and these are so realistic. They just love them. The only problem is they are really not meant to be played with as the bristles will come out easily. So, they sit as a decoration for halloween by their fireplace (not too close) until Halloween is here. Best for realism that I found. The rating is lower only because I do not feel it can be a Toy."
2,A costume Prop...that's about it.,"I was hoping for a higher end costume prop than what I got. But considering that's all it is, a prop. I'm ok with it. The broom is shorter than I imagined but is the length advertised. The bristles were already falling out when it arrived. I was hoping for something I could use year after year - this isn't it."
1,Support of Quickbooks Pro 2001,"This would probably be a good product if you could get support.I am having problems with several features and have tried to get support. I was told by the automated service to enter my credit card number - did this - then told to wait on the phone for an hour to speak to someone. did not do this. One would think when you spend [this much money] for software it would work out of the box, and if it didn't you would get some form of free support.I am currently looking at other small business software, and would advise anyone to look elsewhere."
4,"Excellent, if only...","Works very well, easy to install and manage. If only the multiple user mode had more precise control over access by user, (specific transacions and specific reports). Product gives impression of some shades of sophistication in access control but reality is that it's all or nothing. Still a fine, fine package for small or medium size companies with normal business processes; better than some larger software packages I've used.Use of classes to accommodate departmental or project reporting needs outside training or willingness to experiment."
2,Was not impressed,"I have recently received several DVD's as gifts for my 4 1/2 month old baby. It seems to me there is a very small window of time where a baby would actually use sign language. Although I'm no expert, I do know what my baby likes. We much prefer ""The Baby Society"" and Baby Einstein ""Neighborhood Animals"". Those two are the winners in our house!"
2,Not practical,I had hoped it would have more useful signs for my twin boys to use...They needed to know how to ask for more milk or more juice not the sign for a table and a chair. (...)
1,Boring,This video did not hold my childs interest---Signing time was so much better. The signs were not the easiest to understand.
1,5 minutes to start,"We put in this DVD and had to sit through 5 minutes of screen logos, warnings, and ads before we were able to actually watch the DVD. I understand not being able to fast forward through the FBI warning, but to not be able to fast forward through the 4 minute ad for their Little Einsteins cartoon was just torture. My baby started crying."
2,Not crazy about this one...,"I'm a huge fan of Baby Einstein, having owned every DVD they have put out. This one, however, I'm really not crazy about. While I understand the concept of basic household items combined with their coordinating signs, I feel they tried to jam too many items into their usual short video time, therefore not being able to have more time with the visuals, which is really what the children love. Take for instance, cat. You were shown the word, the picture and the sign. Then you saw two live cats and that was it. 2 seconds of visual. I know this video is for 1+ but my niece, who is 18 months and loves these videos, even had a hard time keeping interest. Great idea but they should stick to their original format which includes a little more time spent on examples and visuals for true comprehension."
2,Not interesting,I purchased this when my son was approximately 10 months. He watched it a few times. I tried it again after he was 1 years old and he still didnt show any interest. I tried another one to see if I would get the same results and he still was not interested.
2,ok,"I like this video! I thought that it would be a little more up beat than it actually is! It plays slow songs, so when my baby watches this video she gets sleepy!"
2,Problem,"I put this in the DVD player when my grandson was here for a visit and it wouldn't play. The message I received was ""unreadable"". When I looked at the disc it is scratched. The seller was contacted and I'm waiting for a replacement. So far that has not arrived. I only wish they had played it to make sure it would work."
2,not her favorite baby einstein,"This one doesn't seem to hold her attention for very long. I should check the age, maybe she is too young at 18 months. I also wish she would spare us the marketing in the begining of the video that you can't fast forward. My baby don't need to see that crap."
2,NOT happy,"The DVD arrived in average time. Unfortunately, it is NOT new (or even good condition) as described. It skips and my son can't even watch the whole thing. So, what's the use in even having the DVD?"
4,"It Means Well, But Give Me A Choice!","The music, graphics and puppetry in this DVD are superb. The flaw in this DVD is that it doesn't give the non-hearing impared child what it needs. Children need to see a close-up view of a face and lips, mouthing new words. Children who can't yet talk fluidly shouldn't be losing half the screen to signing. It's too confusing. I have a pair of two year olds that clearly get distracted by the hand movements. One major obstacle that most kids face when learning a language is to learn the correct pronunciation of words. They need to see EXACTLY what the tongue and lips are doing to make a sound. The relative size of the mouth of the signer on the screen in this DVD is too small. The signing version should be a special feature. Or make a non-signing version as the special feature where my babies can see a close up of a face mouthing words. Once they can correcly pronounce the words, then they can watch the signing and learn it. But give me a choice here."
2,Review of Baby Wordsworth,I just watched the video with my son and he is a big fan of Baby Einstein Videos. This is the only video that did not hold his interest. There are alot less puppet time in the video. The video goes through the rooms of your house and reads the name of the common words in that room and they do sign language in it. It is definately educational but he started to walk away from the tv. I probably would not buy it if I had the opportunity to review it.
1,I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.,"I like Marlee Matlin and some of the other DVDs in the Baby Einstein series so was looking forward to this one. It is unfortunately not that great for teaching sign language (I prefer both ""My Baby Can Talk"" and ""Signing Time""). The worst part of it is how long a child has to wait for the actual content; there is no way to skip the COMMERCIAL for ""Disney's Little Einsteins""!"
2,First Words for Babies?,"I have several grandchildren who have learned to sign and I am a strong believer of teaching babies to sign before they can speak to reduce frustration. It is truly amazing.Although the quality of this video is excellent, the words taught are more appropriate for older children. As a result, this DVD did not capture nor hold the attention of my grandchildren. Instead of teaching words like mommy, daddy, baby, milk, eat and drink - this video teaches words such as clock and computer. I must say that I was surprised.My grandchildren learned to sign and speak from My Baby Can Talk and I would recommend this series instead. Not only does My Baby Can Talk teach more appropriate first signs and words but it also shows babies signing, includes a parent tutorial and my grandchildren love it!"
2,A bit amazed!,"I confess to being a bit amazed at the quality of the product. With the Disney money and a talented actress involved, I was amazed at what they offer.Look - I am absolutely fascinated by the baby signing movement and was anticipating something extraordinary, given the resources behind it, but it is pretty basic that if you are interested in babies learning to sign, it would be useful to consider the world from the baby's point of view. So where do words such as ""puzzle"" and ""computer"" come from? Pity!If you want the gold standard, have a look at My Baby Can Talk for your baby."
1,signing time blows this video out of the water,"I am a big fan of baby einstein, and every other one I've bought my 13 month old has loved, but this one is not captivating to him, and not nearly as catchy as the other baby einstein dvd's. If you are interested in teaching your child signs, whether or not they can hear, I would HIGHLY recommend Signing Time instead. It's real sign language as well, but shows a lot of repetition, kids and babies doing the signs, cute songs, etc. I can't emphasize enough how much better these videos are than the baby wordsworth.In fact, the signing time people were used to train the cute little twin boys in Meet the Fockers movie. You can buy it on amazon, but also check out what they're all about at signingtime (dot) com"
2,"Love Marlee Matlin and BE, but not impressed with this one","As a huge Marlee Matlin fan and a fan of Baby Einstein, and the mother of a signing 16 month old, I was so excited to get this DVD. It arrived and I watched it with my son almost immediately. I was very disappointed. The pace is slow and did not hold my son's attention. Also, as a teacher and a mother, I know that kids need repitition. There is not nearly enough repetition of each sign, each sign is only repeated twice, once at the beginning of the segment and once at the end. Also, I believe the signs they chose were far too complicated for little ones. Overall, I am not impressed!"
1,Terrible -- don't buy it.,"This DVD is too slow moving. It doesn't hold my child's attention. Buy Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, Numbers Nursery, Neighborhood Animals or Noah instead."
5,Great DVD!,This is a great DVD. I bought it based on the description on Amazon. It shipped quickly. My son LOVES this video. He is very interactive with it and has learned a lot from it already.
5,Another great DVD from Baby Einstein!,I'm really pleased with Baby Wordsworth and my son enjoys it as well. It's helped him with his language skills and he gets excited when he sees an image he recognizes and is able to say its name.
3,Ok...as they get older...,"My daughter loved another Baby Einstein as an infant. We got her this one at about 1 year. She did not start watching it until about 18 months, as far as it holding her attention. Now, at 20 months, she loves it and says most all of the words."
3,Not the greatest...,"I was hoping that this DVD would help introduce baby sign language to my child. However, it is pretty disappointing for a Baby Einstein product. I expected the DVD to teach more practical terms such as hello, nap, play, parts of the body, eat-instead it teaches objects like bowl. Hopefully my child will be more interested in it when she gets a little older! Otherwise,I will have to pass it along to friends...I would recommend saving your money or spending it on Baby Mozart or Baby Neptune DVDs. Those are fantastic!"
4,LOVED IT!,"My son was speech delayed, but could pick up sign language very quickly. He learned every word on this dvd within a few weeks of watching, and we were communicating. He loved it! We didn't start watching until he was around 17 months, though; I am not sure how appropriate they are for very young babies. For my son, they served a great purpose.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
5,Love this movie!,"This is one of my favorite Baby Einstein videos. My 10 month old son loves the Baby Einstein puppets; he smiles and laughs every time they come on the screen. And fortunately, this DVD is full of the puppets. I really like that sign language is incorporated into it as well. Even if baby doesn't catch on to it right away, I've definitely learned a lot, and have used lots of the signs on an everyday basis. I find some of the Baby Einstein DVDs to be a little boring, but this one is really entertaining and actually keeps my interest, mainly because of the signing."
3,Too Boring!,"I love Baby Einstein products, especially the videos, but my 1year old found this one so boring he didn't sit through even the first viewing. They just say the name of something and show a picture of it and have a woman signing the word on half the screen. He loved neighborhood animals and baby neptune a lot more."
3,issues of class,"I just have to add that, as a sign language interpreter, it's nice to see this addition to the series. However, it would behoove Julie Aigner-Clark to include images of homes other than the upper middle-class/upper-class homes she depicts in this video. Not *all* of us lie in our beautiful, canopied, king-size beds reading to our children in our expensive homes. I wish she had depicted the other homes that exist for countless other children: apartments, lower middle-class homes, etc. -- even a double-wide trailer would be nice to see. *All* we see are the homes of the economically advantaged. I guess one could argue that lower-class families may not be in the position to afford 'Baby Einstein' DVDs/videos, but they may be getting them from the library. And so many children will *not* see their home depicted in a DVD about the very subject."
2,Too boring,"As a baby and a toddler, my daughter found this to be one of the more boring Baby Einstein videos. There are not enough animals and music in it and it is too slow moving."
2,Baby Signing Time Is Far Better,"My daughter loves all the other Baby Einstein movies; however this one is about like watching paint dry. After the first 5 minutes my daughter doesn't have any interest, and me personally I find it a totally boring. There are some things in the movie that are cute and make my daughter laugh, but those are very few and far between.If you are interested in baby sign language, I would strongly recommend Baby Signing Time. My daughter loves the baby signing time movies and when I put it on she comes running to watch them.Don't waste your money on Baby Wordsmith, I would recommend any other Baby Einstein movie."
3,"Great Educational DVD, but poorly made",I love the DVD but I have only had it for a few weeks and it cracked down the middle. I didn't handle it too hard just the normal use. I don't think it was made well.
5,Excellent!,This is a great product! I bought it for my nephew and he was already signing a few words after the first time we watched it. The music and children in the video kept his attention.
5,Can't go wrong....,Can't go wrong if your child loves these videos. My grandson watches them over and over and over and over......
3,Disappointed,"My daughter typically loves the Baby Einstein series, but this one ""Words Around the House"" does not interest her very much. The ASL isn't repetitive enough to really teach first time learners (even with mom helping.) She just wasn't stimulated by the pictures and the pace. Also, I find it highly irritating that I have to fast forward through at least 6 advertisements to get to the main menu."
5,Educational,"We have been trying to get out daughter to say more than the few words she knows for a while. Once she started watching this she can't stop talking! It is great! She knows what everything around the house is - after only watching a couple of times. She has been talking and repeating almost anything anyone says since she started watching this video. While TV is not a babysitter, educational videos have a place for small children. A review of the newest Baby Einstein ranted about ADHD and more if children watch TV before age 2 - do more research! I am a Sociologist/Psychologist and if I thought that it was harming my child or was uneducational, I would not let them do it."
5,Great Addition to the baby eintstein family!!,"My kids just love this DVD. The music is typical of BE. I was also able to fast forward/skip through all of the commercials.So if you love Baby Einstein, this is a definate must have!"
3,Disappointing--NOT ASL!,"I am very disappointed in this video. My 16-month daughter seems to like to like it somewhat, but it doesn't hold her interest like the other Einstein videos, with the exception of the sign language part. I have instructed my daughter in American Sign Language so that is why she is interested. However, do not be mistaken in thinking that this is American Sign Language. Where as some signs are, others ARE NOT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. This is very disappointing to me. I want her to learn proper sign language so she will be able to use it in the future if need be. What is the purpose in learning a made up language???? In addition, they only show the sign once before going on to something else. If you really want a good video that teaches sign language to infants/toddlers, I recommend BABY SEE N' SIGN. This is an excellent video and my daughter picks this video out to watch more than any other video she has."
4,a little disappointed,We love the series but this one lacks.It's too slow paced to keep my daughters attention. She likes Baby Noah (animals) much better. This is good if you are teaching sign language.
1,Worst book I've read yet!,"This is the worst book I've read yet! In one section he advises his boy to hit another boy? That's not right, he's trying to make his son sane? Sounds like a horrible way to raise a child."
5,Hands down; the best book I've ever read,"I have a lot of books, and a lot of those books I can honestly say I love. This far surpasses all of my books. It's like the author (John Eldredge) has some kind of magic that sees directly into my heart... either that or he's some kind of genius. Not sure. Maybe it's both. I love this book, and I think everyone should read this book at least once. EVERYONE. It's a great, great book that will bring to light things you may have already known but just didn't put into words or ever really look at about yourself and possible reasons as to why you might do things or think things or be the way you are. It gives you perspective and knowledge about a lot of things you didn't know as well. It's a very good book."
3,"Masculinity 101, just add more gospel","Wild at Heart Review (2010 ed)-There's some really good stuff in John Eldredge's book Wild at Heart. Wild at Heart is masculinity 101 strait from the Bible. What is sorely missing at the core of the book is the living gospel of Jesus Christ and the gospel response for every follower of Jesus Christ to go and make disciples of all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and teaching these new disciples to obey everything that Jesus has commanded (Mat 28:18-20). That is where every man and woman gets their true sense of significance, not their masculine or feminine journey. Keep this in mind and I believe you'll get a lot of good out of Wild at Heart."
1,Save your money and read your Bible instead,The author needs to spend more time reading the scriptures and less time watching movies to obtain inspiration for his work. I fear for Christian men if this is considered the best there is.
2,Chapter One was good....rambling and poor analysis for the remainder.,"After reading the intro and first chapter, I was very excited to read on. Unfortunately the book became a rambling sermon of movie reviews, a few Bible verses, and life stories, most of which seemed made up in order to fit the mold of whatever the author was talking about at the time. I still can't figure out where the author was going from one chapter to the next. Chapter One would have made a great article, and for that it gets a reluctant two stars."
4,Over the Top Sometimes,"John Eldredge's style is a little over the top sometimes, but his over all message is right on.He speaks to me like a kindred spirit.Since first reading Wild Heart it has truly changed the way I perceive this world around me. Now everytime I see a movie I can't help but to think of what it reveals about my soul and my deepest desires.This book has been a huge success for a reason.I recommend it to everyone.Also HIGHLY recommended:""Blue Like Jazz - Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality"" by Donald Miller"
2,Oversimplified and overhyped,"Eldridge makes a typical mistake of many folks -- that his struggle is that of everyone else. He fails to recognize that God made men different. Just look at the disciples. In fact, Christ chose them for their differences, not their similarities. Yet Eldridge sees one way for all men to grow as believers. And he is mistaken. Climbing the highest mountain and taking huge risks may work for some, but it simply isn't the style of all. Nor should it be. This book touches a nerve in young men in particular, thus its popularity. But it is not especially Biblical and should not be considered part of the accepted works of the modern evangelical movement. In fact, this one is best left on the shelves."
1,"Mundane: common, ordinary, unimaginative.","for having the word ""wild"" in the title its quite a let down. its the most mundane/boring repetitive book i have ever read. its like someone came to John Eldredge and said ""hey john would you like to write an entire book of the same chapter over and over and over and over and over?"" I am a christian and i agree with that men should be embracing their masculinity as opposed to apologizing for it. the problem I have with it is that everyone says its the best bold and enlightening book they've read and say that every man should read it. forget it, just read the back and you'll have read the entire book. its not bold its old."
3,Wild at Heart Review,"I just finished reading the revised and expanded version of John Eldredge's classic, Wild at Heart. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand what lies at the core of manhood. John is down to earth, blunt, and extremely honest in his approach. What I loved about the book is that it just makes sense to me. I'm not an outdoors kind of guy. I don't enjoy working with my hands. Still, every chapter resonated with me (especially Ch. 6 The Father's Voice ) In my opinion too many ""Men's"" books try to play off some cliche or over spiritualize things when it comes to manhood. Wild at Heart is as deep as it is wide. I'll definitely be re-reading it.Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul. It'd make a great Father's Day gift!*Even though the folks at Thomas Nelson provided me a free copy of this book for review, I am under no obligation to post a positive review."
5,Can't put it down,"woke up at 2am and realized my package had came yesterday afternoon, couldnt fall back to sleep so i began reading wild at heart, and I cannot put this book down, it is amazing as it flows with biblical teachings and eldredge takes away all the religious garbage and gets to the point, I have been following his materials for a year now mostly his videos and audio downloads, I am on page 100 of the wild at heart i began reading at 2am this morning it is now 10am i took a few breaks for food and coffee, I can honestly admit i am 22 years old in college and have never read a full book on my own and this book i cant put down and i never read books, I feel that by the end this book will save my life as a man"
5,How did he know my heart so well?,"I read the first chapter and could not stop. Eldridge knows my heart and sees that the strength is being sapped out of it by the expectations of others.Find a battle worth fighting. Seek an adventure worth living. Win the beauty worth having (probably the beauty you already have).Three days after I read a borrowed copy, I bought one for me to re-read and four to give to friends.Just read the first chapter and see if he speaks to your heart."
2,Primer in what a man's need are.,I read this book after reading Captivating by the same author. Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. I did not read as easily and though there were some valid points on what makes a man tick I found it lacking compared to Captivatiing.
1,not a book on biblical manhood,"The purpose of this book is to not to teach you, from the Bible, how to be a man. The Author even says from the outset ""They (being men) need a deeper understanding of why they long for adventures and battles and beauty and why God made them just like that."" This is not what the Bible teaches about Biblical manhood. For that, check Eph 4:12-15."
5,Wild at Heart review,"Wild at Heart by John Eldridge addresses an important issue among Christian men today. Eldridge defines and describes the problem of passivity and boredom that has taken so many Christian men captive. He gives a call to reclaim the masculinity that has been lost by so many, pointing the reader to Jesus Christ as the one to imitate. The Church needs more men who are ""wild at heart"", embracing their God-given role as a man.I thought that Eldridge did a nice job of laying out the problem he sees in many of today's men. Yet he doesn't just leave it at that. I was greatly helped by the suggestions and advice he gave on reclaiming our ""wild heart"". This book impelled and encouraged me to stand up and be a man, true to myself and to whom God created me to be. I think this is a great book to read, not only for men, but also for women, as it encourages both to rediscover the ""wild heart"" of a man as God has defined it."
1,Should be pulled from Christian Bookstores,"Just wanted to add my vote to the DON""T BUY THIS side - and DON'T give this as a present... It will hurt, not help.To quote from a critique by Daryl Wingerd:""Not only can I not recommend this book, I feel compelled to warn Christians to keep it away from others, especially from the lost and from the immature believer. Books like Wild at Heart--books that humanize God and glorify man--books that teach a generation of Christian men, already weakened by humanistic philosophy and biblical ignorance, to look anywhere other than the pages of the Bible for guidance--have a seductive appeal to the flesh--a poisoning effect in the already deceitful and desperately wicked heart of man. """
1,Not wild about Wild at Heart,"John Eldredge wants us to believe that Jesus wants men to be like William Wallace in Braveheart. His idea, simply, is that men are warriors and Jesus' desire is for each of us to find our way back to that place- Doing battle, Going on Adventures and Winning a beauty.He offers primarily celluloid theology, substituting movie scripts for scripture and the actions of William Wallace, James Bond and others for the lessons of the Christ. He never offers to reconcile his thesis with the words from the sermon on the mount- that happy men are made from those who mourn, are meek and make peace.While his ideas about healing the wounds left on us by the past hold great merit, trying to find that healing in film plots instead of Christ's words falls far short of where today's Christian men need to be."
1,What a crock,This book is an absolute excuse for pussified males to act like the rebels they wish they were. Replace nature for god and this book would seem like it was written for troubled teens. Why to confuse everyone.
1,Cop out...,"In Wild at Heart, John Eldredge gives us a 'psychology lite' answer to a problem that may not even exist. He hangs a lot of his effort on the symptom that men are 'nice guys'. This is not a problem. In 2-3 years this title - along with many other books that fill the Christian section at Barnes & Noble - will be forgotten. Read John Piper's Biblical Manhood, instead. It's much better."
1,"I haven't even received it yet. I heard the book was great, but who ever mailed it out I still have received it.","A little irritated, because I haven't received the book yet. It's been almost a month now and I have received a book that I ordered two weeks later already. So, shipping is slow."
2,What does this say about women?,"Does anyone else have a problem with what this book says about women? They are simply objects to be saved. And not even all women, just the pretty ones."
1,Heresy,"This book uses the dangerous allurment of flowery language and ""feel good about yourself"" theology to suck it's readers in to thinking that it's doctrinally sound. But a closer look reveals misquoted Scripture and a doctrine that extols the 'self' instead of Jesus Christ. Page after page reveals open-theistic thinking and Freudian ideologies. Eldridge blames personal sin on others in his life and encourages the reader to do the same.If you read it, make sure to measure it carefully against the Word of God. Eldridge contradicts Scripture a LOT! Beware....."
2,Not what you'd expect...,This study is based more on psychology than Christian theology. It was not what I was looking for or expected.
2,A lot about nothing,"Did not like the reference to priests on more than one occasion. He has no clue to the life of a priest,"
1,Not Worth It,"Started studying this with a Bible study group. We stopped halfway through. Premise for his whole book, man was created outside of Eden, thus unbridled is ""Way Out There"" theology. If he intended to twist scriptures to make his point from the beginning, we should have stopped right there. But as we read on, we saw that this was an author dealing with some issues of his own manhood that we were not. Save your money."
1,Poor excuse for a Christian book!,"""What has happened the Christian community?? This is one of the worst books I've read. Right from the start Eldredge claims that Bible Study is boring. That has not been my experience when learning about our God! Then he goes on to say that God called an evil infested creation ""Good"". Eldredge has created for himself a god that is different than the God of the Bible. God called His creation ""Good"" BEFORE sin entered. The ""wildness"" that Eldredge relishes is a result of sin. Next he completely denies the Omniscience of God. To state that ""God took a risk"" is to imply that God does not know the outcome. That is a denial of the God of the Bible. I'm greatly saddened by the popularity of this book! I'm greatly saddened by the state of God's people"
1,What a crock...,"This book has to be one of the most annoyingly offensive books that I have ever read in my life. Not only is scripture misinterpreted, but the author actually believes that certain activities, such as fishing, hiking, and beating the crap out of each other is what makes you a ""real"" man. John Eldredge has so much animosity towards ""nice guys"", that he compares them to Mr. Rogers and makes other such demeaning comments. If you don't hunt elk or go rock climbing, then you are made out to be totally worthless.Well, I hate fishing. I occasionally enjoy a good hike, but I'm not crazy about it. I'm really not crazy about fighting, either. I guess I have a long way to go, according to Mr. Eldredge. Words cannot express how much I hate this book.Don't waste your time reading this piece of junk."
5,A book every man & wife should read,"This book is written focused on men, but women should read it too. Great insight into the understanding of a mans heart and soul. Don't forget the Field Manual."
2,A Little Over the Top,"The claims that Eldredge makes are a little hard to believe such as the comparison of God to William Wallace. God is loving, merciful, and beautiful while he says that he is a warrior that is filled with anger towards his people. To me this is too much. He also makes claims that women were not a factor in many past movements and claims that men are the one's that always stop hate and evil in the world. But the fact is that women started the anti-slavery movement and also men were the ones that started the institution of slavery. This is just one example of women stopping slavery and men creating hate. He says that there are too many nice guys in the Christian world and he sees that as a bad thing. Nice does not equal weakness. But there are some good points which address the issue of standing up for what you believe in. This is a testostrone packed work."
3,Good Book,"I found the book to be affirming & encouraging. Some good principles & biblical truths reagarding the nature of man and his purpose. However, I believe Eldridge wrongfully traces the characteristics of man examined in the book backward to God, rather than from God to the image of man. For example, if God is a ""risk-taker"" then we have a open God who is not completely sovereign, which is unbiblical. The reader should read with this in mind, and mine the book for all it's worth...lot's of golden nuggets."
2,Misses the Mark,"Has some good open insights, but misses the mark as the author wants us to return to the patriarchal ways of thinking that actually hurts true masculinity.Men-The Gods of Love"
5,Wild at Heart audio cd,This was an excellent opportunity for me to read and enjoy this book that I seem to have been too busy or on the go to get to (I had already purchased the hard copy). I would definitely recommend it
5,Informative,This book was very interesting and insightful. One to get if your ready for your eyes to be opened.
3,Wild at Heart (revised) by John Eldredge,"Wild at Heart (revised) by John EldredgeI first read this book about eight years ago. I don't know that my opinion of it has changed much after my recent re-read. Although praise rains on it from many fronts, it still doesn't grip me as it seems to for other men. I agree with Eldgredge on many points but found myself losing interest throughout many parts of the book.I appreciate the acknowledgement of a men's need for a battle to fight, a beauty to rescue, and an adventure to live. I also agree that righteous masculinity is being squashed in our culture. Men are frequently portrayed as either wimps or beasts, much to the detriment of society.Although the book seemed to drag on and I didn't connect with his delivery, I'd recommend the book to any man if for only to identify what some of those `longings' in your heart may be. It's not just ok to be a man, it's great to be one...and to act like one."
1,Worst book EVER,"This has got to be the worse book ever written. The author states that everyone has a wound and and the wound is nearly always given by his father. What a bunch of BS. My Father loved me. Neither I nor my siblings have any stupid wound from our Father. Neither does my wife nor my friends. I thought we were to respect our parents, not lie the responisiblity for my screwed up life on them.My wound is the result of the sinful nature into which I was born.Also, I don't need to be Grizzly Adams to have a relationship with God. I don't need to go out into nature to find God. I find God sitting in front of my urban office in the wee hours in the morning, praying to the God of my salvation.Do yourself a favor...don't even open this book."
2,Average,"Eldredge does a good job of tapping into Christian consumerism with his hit book, ""Wild at Heart."" John is a great speaker who uses current hit movies to augment his messages. Wild at Heart was an adventure in the obvious. If you are a man, act like a man. If you don't act like a man, you are not Wild at Heart according to John. I agree with some portions of this, but I also believe that we all must act as we are wired to act based on personality.Are there differences between men and women? Sure, but are there guys who like to shop? Yes. Are there women who like to play football? Yes.So, this is not a bad book, this is not a good book - it is a book, and again, really just emphasizes the obvious. Read Away! JVD"
3,Wild about Psychology: A Lot Cooler on the Bible's View,"John Eldredge, in the spirit of Rick Warren, has written a book that almost anyone can agree with--if you want to hear psychological theories about men and mid-life issue. But the tendency is to treat the Bible's view of life more lightly--if it's considered at all. Jim and Sally Conway have done a much better job in Men in Mid-Life Crisis and Women in Mid-Life Crisis of seeing real answers to needs during this time of life."
1,"hey guys, like lattes? eldredge says you're a pansy","As a twenty-something heterosexual man who owns a miniature poodle and enjoys strawberry margaritas and massages, I don't really identify with much of this book.Eldredge, bless his heart, is so frantic to prove this idea of macho masculinity that he grasps at any and all Biblical content that can be twisted into proving his point. Quite simply, his exegesis is hurried and his hermeneutic is careless.In the end, there seems to be no focus or point at all. It's just a fountain of strangeness. There are much better works on Christian manhood available. Practically anything is better than this."
1,Not worth the read,"John Eldredge is writing from a fundamentalist perspective, and is part of the backlash against the feminist movement among other things.The following are my major concerns with Eldredge's book:1) Eldredge speaks right past anthropological scholarship that regards gender as a social construction.2) Eldredge takes stereotypes of masculinity and femininity and makes them normative and ordained by God.3) Furthermore, Eldredge's stereotypes are rooted in sexist notions of manhood and womanhood.4) Eldredge uses decontextualised texts from the Bible to uncritically support his argument.May I suggest an alternative, a book more rooted in Scripture and scholarship than 'Wild at Heart'; namely, 'New Adam' by Philip Culbertson.New Adam: The Future of Male Spirituality"
5,Wild at Heart Book Review,"Received quickly from the seller and in excellent conditon, the treatise was an unusual assessment of the spiritual conditon of men and their relationship to other men and women in this age. The author's recommendatons were thought-provoking and challenging."
1,Irresponsible at Heart,"Sadly there will be many people who take heed of Mr. Eldredge's hypocritical and irresponsible interpretaion of a Christian man.In Mr. Eldredge's view a Christian father encourages his children to use violence to solve problems. Even for a kindergarten student, (this is his advice!)I am disappointed and enraged that I read this book with hopes of some inspiration. The views that are presented are so absurd they border on sensational. Maybe Mr. Eldredge is the real poser and is chuckling all the way to the bank.If you want to be a good man and a role model for your children do not buy this book."
5,Wild at Heart,This is the best book about men and what makes them tick. I actually bought 4 copies for close friends.
4,A much needed review of Christian Manhood,"I liked this book because Eldredge gives men encouragement to be themselves without any guild about it. God knows how much guilt is thrown at today's Christian men. I believe Eldredge is right in many ways when it comes to the condition of most of them men you find in Christian churches (I cannot speak about any other kinds). I know that many of them would benefit from reading this book. It is a book for someone who is willing to think about things in a self-examinng way, and from a historical perspective as well."
3,"Powerful at Points, But Claims about Gender Dangerous","While I will immediately admit that John Eldredge's book, Wild at Heart, inspired me and encouraged me in so many ways when I deeply needed help, I have also come to see many of the author's claims about gender to be made on dangerous ground. Within Christian circles, a dominant and sad sort of patriarchal control and manipulation sometimes thrives. Men and women are discussed as being vastly different, and women are reffered to as the ""weaker"" or the ""submissive"" sex. Though Eldredge does not use these terms, some of his analysis leads in this direction.I would caution against interpreting women as ""needy"" or ""submissive""--and instead come to see women as strong, capable and equal to men. (for more information, see Christians for Biblical Equality)"
5,Quit your whining,"This was an excellent depiction of what men are going through and how they can cope with life's struggles. I hope that the other reviews do not discourage anyone from reaading this book, it is excellent. I find it very interesting how people can read a book to find ""the secret"" to a man's soul and then when they are finished, they dog the book. As if they know what the real secret is and just wanted to check if Mr. Eldredge was in line with their beliefs... I thought the book was in line with Biblical values and had some very good practical application. Sometimes super spiritual people read much further into the ""true"" and ""deep"" meanings of things instead of taking them for face value. I thoroughly enjoyed the booked and hope you do too!"
4,Great Choice!,"I signed up for [...] via Nelson Publishers and read Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul by James Eldridge. I enjoyed this book because it helped me identify with my grandfather. He fought in WWII and was an avid hunter and outdoorsman. I appreciated the author's quotes from G.K. Chesterton and found the part on page 174 where he says, ""discipline is never the point. The whole point of the devotional life is connecting with God."" The outdoors in general for many men in my life has been a place of comfort, challenge, and identity. As a mother of two sons, I found this book fascinating!"
1,don't bother,The book seems to be based primarily on popular psychology and over simplified cliches. He uses scripture incidentally rather than as the basis for his assertions. At times the book struck me as totally silly. Look somwhere else for a Biblically based substantive discussion of a man's soul.
5,Live life the way you were meant to live it!,"A friend recommended I read this book. I thought I wouldn't like it.I was wrong. I was overwhelmed by the emotions this book released in me. This book uncovered the personal wounds that have kept me from enjoying life at the fullest. It revealed how I received these ""wounds"". It explained how I can avoid passing these wounds to my sons. I see my responsibilities as a father in a whole new way. My relationship with my 5 year old has never felt stronger. My relationship with God has been accelerated.I recommend this book to any father (especially children from 3-6 years old). My wife also read this book. She has since seen her role as a mother and wife in a whole new way."
2,ho-hum,"Wow - looking at these reviews it seems you either loved it or hated it. Well, I didn't love it or hate it. I read it about 2 months ago and I don't even really remember what it was about - other than that men should reclaim their wild heart. It was certainly not a life-changing experience for me. It was an interesting easy read - something I'd take to the beach with me. I didn't agree with all he had to say about women - how we don't want to be independant etc. I don't think that's true. Also, being a woman, a wild man might be nice to date and somewhat exciting, but when it comes to marriage, I'd much prefer the ""really nice guy""."
4,Discovering Heart and Soul,I am reading this book to learn more about how men process life happening. Looking forward to learning some new information and have tools to communicate.
4,Wild at Heart,This book is being read for members of our Saturday Morning Men's Bible Study group. It is an enjoyable read and we hope to finish it after the holidays are done.
1,Lets see- Human wisdom + experience=Power? I dont think so-,"After formulating 3 life objectives/goals based upon human perspective and exprience, the author decides to try and incorporate some scripture- and movies (some R-rated) to make the point that we, as men, need to change. So where is the LORD in all this? Far away, unfortunately- authors other works -Sacred Romance, Waking the Dead are even more new age and experientially based. Pray for Mr. Eldredge!"
2,Incomplete for men,"I have found this book to be very lacking in helping men be men. My husband had a hard enough time growing and walking with God without hearing go be a ""little boy"", tear your family apart. This book has caused a extremely passive man to become even more passive with his family and more self centered. In fact we have 2 older teens. One in college one graduating high school this year. Our ""man"" is moving out today at my request. Our children love their dad very much but also have acknwledged ""this is his fault""."
4,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book. It was easy reading and very enjoyable. I definitely learned a lot. I would recommend this book to any man who may not have had the best father while growing up. I give it a thumbs up.
4,A great book to give to the right man!,"I read this book based off a reccomendation of a friend who buys it for all her guy friends. I'll tell you, as a female, it is great to hear the views Eldredge has. Men are not created by God to be weak kneed individuals, who exchange passion for femininity. However, I do think he draws too many results that are geared towards men who are more outdoorsy or sports like. I'm not sure the introverted bookworm may find this book that life altering. I did give the book to my boyfriend after reading it because I could see it applying perfectly to his life. For the man that longs to be courageous and on adventure and feels 'stuck' being the nice guy, Eldredge encourages him that the former is what God is searching for. As Lewis put, and Eldredge perfectly quoted, God...and thus by example men shouldn't be safe, but GOOD. A great read to motivate a man to be the man he really is or wants to be. Let's go on adventure together!"
5,"Real Masculinity, Solving Gender Confusion","I cannot tell you in this brief paragraph how this book has changed my view of God, of guys, of girls, and of myself.This book isn't about being a ""macho"" man or to brainwash to a ""religious"" belief...This is the truth, and the truth will set you free. :)"
4,"Re:I am a man and I'm ashamed of this author, March 7, 2002","Larry Jon Graubner wrote a couple things I'd like to comment on.""He forgets that God shunned Esau the wild man and chose Jacob, the mama's boy and soft-skinned conniver.""Actually, Esau despised the birthright and sold it to Jacob for a bowl of soup. Esau turned his back on God, not the other way around.""Eldredge thinks men need to be warriors and fierce. Yet God told David he couldn't build the temple because he was a warrior. God granted that privilege to David's son Solomon, a philospher king, the wisest man ever.""David couldn't build the temple not because he was a warrior, but because he had shed innocent blood. David murdered Uriah so he could marry Bathsheba. This is why he could not build the temple.I don't know how foundational these two points are to your dislike of this book, but you might want to go reread it again.Nathan DeWitt"
5,Wild at Heart,"This is a great book, particularly for parents and/or grandparents raising up boys. I liked it so well I purchased copies for my 2 sons and my son-in-law who are raising sons. Wish I had read it before my sons were born!"
5,Wild at Heart,Great book for men especially but great learning for women who want to really do right by your man. Shows the inner character and personality of how a man is made and how they too need lots of support.
3,"Wild Theology, Civilized Application","Wild at Heart has a great premise: The church needs more men. For the most part, I agree with this book, but some of the theological stances of the author are simply not Biblical, from the idea that ""God takes chances..He is a wild man!"" to ""The human heart is not inherently wicked"". Albeit, these are paraphrases from the book, but the ideas remain. Nevertheless, I still recommend this book with those theological caveats, as most of what Mr. Eldredge says is worth a thought by the modern Christian man."
4,Wild at Heart,My order was recieved on time. I love this book. I will be ordering more items on amazon.com
5,Will stir up your Soul,In this book by Johnn Eldrige you can help but fire up your soul. It is mans birth right to live as God intended Him to and not as society wants man to live. The book takes one back to the begining in Genesis and ends with the realization that we must chose our own path.
2,John Bly and Sam Keen do better,"this is very worthwhile territory and you could do worse than read/listen to this book.i mean no disrespect to etheridge's many fans, but i believe john bly & sam keen, among others, cover this territory with more originality, sophistication and thoughtfulness."
2,"Follow Christ, not your heart!","The late great Rich Mullins penned the song ""Maker of Noses."" The lyrics drive home the criticism of the premise of this book. Mullins writes, ""They said, 'Boy, you just follow your heart', but my heart just led me into my chest, they said, 'Boy, you just follow your dreams', but my dreams were only mixed emotions, they said 'Boy, you just follow your nose', but the direction changed every time I went and turned my head. Then Mullins points out, But the Father of hearts and the Maker of noses and the giver of dreams He's the one I have chosen and I will follow Him.This book would have been more useful if it would have been presented as a secular study and not a Christian work. His use of Scripture is minimal and terribly misused. His references to ""R"" rated films turns this into psychobabble. Still, I added one star because some of his points about validation and risk are worth pondering.Bottom line--don't follow your heart, follow HIM."
3,wild at Heart,This is a resource book intended to help those needing counseling. It was recommended and will be an asset to my library.
5,"Highly recommended for any guy, any age","This definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time. I would recommend it to any guy, any age, especially those young men in their teenage years. At first one would be easy to say ""oh great, another book on how to be a good Christian guy"" but after reading the first couple of chapters I was hooked! John takes on every issue of a guy's heart, most I didn't even realize till be pointed them. He also touches on many issues that the go against what our modern churches try to turn guys into. His main point is to follow your heart. God has put many desires in every man's heart for a reason. Once these desires are understood, with God's guidance, we can be everything He created us to be. A true classic, and easy to read. Highly recommended!"
4,Wild at Heart,"I would recommend it to anyone trying to understand boys. But more heartily to those who didn't have a lot of male figures in their lives. I grew up with two older brothers and a lot of surrogate brothers in their friends. As a result boys have always made sense to me. The ""dirt"" in this book wasn't anything new."
1,Incorrect Amazon Listing!!,"Do NOT buy this Amazon listing! I, too, purchased it, and only recieved Wild at Heart. I was able to get a refund, but I still wasted time and effort in making the purchase in the first place. I guess this listing is just incorrect, somehow. But, bottom line, do NOT buy it if you are expecting to get a bundle package of two books!!"
5,LOVE this book.,"I have read this book several times and reference frequently. It is a book that really helps to understand men. And helps men to understand women more. I believe in the truth of this book and the spiritual guidance it gives. It is more about a deeper spirituality than anything, and teaches you the importance of incorporating it to everyday."
4,A Good Read,"I can't say I agree with everything Eldredge wrote in this book however, it's a great read just the same and it helps bring back some of your most fond childhood memories, if that's a good thing, lol."
3,Wonderful Intentions but somehow lacking,"I really don't know how to conclude my feelings on this book. The intentions are great. There are some great themes brought up that need to be dealt with. However, Eldredge just seems to fall short when following through with the substance. At best I have to say that this book's philosophy is shallow. Yet, there are some seeds of wisdom and insight that might help some men realize their own weaknesses.What really turned me off was how much Eldredge leaned on Hollywood to promulgate his message. Hollywood...go figure. He also minimizes important characteristic traits that are Christian and necessary for success.The old timers used to say, ""There is a ditch on both sides of the road."" True manhood is a balance. Eldredge unfortunately has us sliding off the road into extremism.Again, great intentions. Men need all the help they can get in these days. But I'd rather reread Dobson's books to men then this stuff."
5,Great book!,I couldn't believe the price I could get this book for! It came within just a few days and in great condition. John Eldredge did an incredible job writing this -- nailed it! -- and I feel everyone should read this in order to understand our hearts and how we were created (man and woman!).
5,kdl,My wife purchased this book for me and it was one of the best books I have read. It was hard to put down and could relate to it in many ways. I would recomment to others.
4,"Interesting, thought provoking book","Enjoyed most of this book. In the sections where the author regurgitates dogma, his opinions become predictable, muddy, and sometimes backwards (gender roles, physical aggression, etc), but most of the book is sufficiently enlightened to be thought provoking, useful, and invigorating."
3,A hard book to get into,"I am an extremely quick reader and I love books of all kinds, so for me to take almost 4 months to read a short (relative) book as this one it says a lot.Truthfully I found it hard to get into and even harder to continue reading. In many ways it was as if someone was trying to put me to sleep. Now the idea behind the book was not a bad one for christian readers in discovering who to be ""human"" meaning having fun in their own life and still remaining aligned with the will of God.The problem was more with the way it was presented. The Author has a good writing style in itself, his narrations are just so dry that I needed water to swallow them down.I have passed the book on to a christian friend of mine and even she only had one thing to say about it. ""I have read better!"""
3,great father's day gift,I think this book would make a great father's day gift.I tried reading it to get a better understanding of the men inmy life but I kept thinking how great it would be for my dadto read it to ameliorate his relationship with his sonmy younger brother. It gives great insight on the role and impacta father plays in his son's life. It's so much about a father's relationship with his son that being a woman I felt weird reading it and wasnt able to take much from it except that if you are a woman reading it youshould share it with sons and fathers you know and care about.
1,"Seductive, mistaken","Eldredge takes Robert Bly's ""Iron John"" and attempts to Christianize it. He does this without discernment, keeping the disparagement for order and commitment, and celebrating ""wildness"" and ""adventure."" One can almost hear Bly's sneering dismissal of office workers.Eldredge is an actor, and a seminar-speaker, and this book is an infomercial. Unhappily, to many Christian men, a few bible verses, and a ""Christian"" publisher are an imprimatur - and they are starting study groups at their church.This book is to be avoided. Eldredge is not a ""wildman"" - he is aping the worst of popular culture."
3,A little narrow minded,"There are some good nuggets in this book, but the author is very insistent that ""all"" men are of one type, and ""all"" women of another. Give us a break--we're individuals. My husband has never gone hunting in his life and he's all man.The cultural references are also a little odd. The author cites the movie ""Legends of the Fall"" and how women adore the Brad Pitt character who is a rugged outdoorsman--and this is the character who abandons the woman and admits he would not have stayed even if she had been pregnant! What woman needs that guy? I personally adored the Aiden Quinn character and thought the woman in the movie was a fool for preferring the outdoorsman.And if you're going to cite ""Jerry Maguire,"" at least spell it right!"
3,Masculine Christianity is a good thing,"Masculine Christianity is a good thing. Eldridge's Wild at Heart is a step in the right direction. It is a step toward rediscovering a masculine Christianity. His basic premise is that every man needs a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue. While I agree with his basic ideas I would have liked a more theological/biblical analysis on manhood. How does being a man relate to Jesus, to the gospel of Christ, to our mission on earth, our redemption, etc. At the very least this book is a step in the right direction. More, much more, needs to be said. Nonetheless, a good step forward."
5,Truly Inspiring,Loved this book. Received it as a gift and read it full through over 2 nights. It has some incredibly inspiring and empowering themes.
4,A good read to look at the heart of Man,"I read this book years ago, just recently purchased the updated version on Kindle. Its a quick read and does a good job asking question about how God designed the heart of Man"
1,The seasons of a man's life,"No matter where you are on your life's journey, this book adds perspective on where you are and where you are heading"
5,great book,"This is a great read. It will not only help sort out who you are as a man and what made you, but will help you understand to role of a father in the life of your son."
5,Fantastic Analysis,This book is a fantastic analysis of our culture's emasculating effect on men. The author has a fantastic solution for tapping into our nature and releasing the man inside.I'm not wounded like the author describes but I've come away with some great guidance and tools for raising my sons as strong Christian men.
3,FLAWED YET CHALLENGING,"The best line in the entire book for me was when He quotes another author' ""don;t asks what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive and go and do that"".The criticisims of other reviewers are justified yet a mature reader will be able to glean something from this book. He refers to recent negative events in his relationship with his wife that left me thinking a good relationship between a man and a woman is simply not possible, or that whatever benefits ther are in being in a relationship are overshadowed by the constant daily battles. { His reference to his response to his wife's giving him directions, and his hegative self-talk when they attended a wedding.} I felt; Wow! He's a Professional counselor and even he isn't happy! He does challenge the status-quo of what a christian man should be, and that is why he strikes a chord with so many readers."
1,did not get what was listed in the Amazon description,"The product description on Amazon listed that I would get volumes 1 and 2, both Wild at Heart and Captivating. We received only volume 1 and when I contacted the seller we were told that the listing was incorrect and we would not be getting the second volume. they say that is an Amazon issue and mistake and one that the seller should not be bound by. We are very disappointed, especially since no communication was initiated by either Amazon or the seller in the 3 weeks after purchase. It wasn't until I contacted them that we found out we would not receive both listed volumes."
1,Skippy goes camping,"What we have here is a case of either the pit Yorkie who roared or a cheap money making infomercial. Check your Bible at the door before entering the world of the he-man. Seems it is to often the little fella (Eldredge stands about 5' tall) that has to stand up on a chair and proclaim to the world he is a ""real man"".Based on what I gleamed from this book, Christian men are a bunch of whipped, bored, mousey, church whimps and all they need to do is go out and be real men.......you know, go hunting and fishing, hiking, camping and mountain climbing and they will suddenly burst forth and blossem into real men. Oh Brother !!!!Well I for one must be a poster boy for a real man based on the info in this book as I served in the US Army Airborne, have seen combat, played college basketball, went to air assult school and better yet I stand a manly 6'5"".So what does that have to be with being a Godly man who desires to serve his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Not a lot."
4,"Beware of ""so called experts"" (Book critics)","As others have pointed out regarding ""professional book critics""Just a quick parallel. Have you ever seen a movie that the critics denounced, yet thoroughly enjoyed it? This book helped me understand a part of being a good adventurous Christian man without being reckless. If this book is right for you, or if you even get one or two good points out of it. Be prayerful regarding it's message, thank God for the wisdom and recognize that as a man, you are moving in a positive direction.God Bless!"
4,A good read for men or parents of boys,"I picked up Wild at Heart on the advice of a friend. The first couple of chapters absolutely blew me away. Eldredge has a keen feel for what is in a man's heart. He gives wonderful Biblical examples of what men are supposed to be and not.I only have two complaints about the book:1) Certain parts of the book (mostly in the middle) tend to be very metaphoric. While this is ok in moderation, I think there was a little too much use for my taste.2) I did not care for the scripture quotes from the Message translation. However, this is purely my personal preference. I do not happen to care for the MSG.All in all the book was well done is is a must for any Christian man's bookshelf. I think it would also be helpful for women to get an understanding of their husbands and sons."
1,Deceit and Arrogance,"I would have given this book no stars if I could. My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it. I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it. Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book. Do not buy it!"
4,"Solid, thought provoking and very needed today","This is a solid, thought provoking book that has come in a timely way today for men in search of meaning. More importantly, it helps the reader understand why God has created man the way he is. Some have critisized it for lacking tons of scriptual support yet have failed to understand the ""spirit"" of the book. To them, I say, chill out, enjoy life and breath deep the breath of God again. If you are having a crises of identity, bored with church as too programatic or simply lost the reason to enjoy life... Then this book is a must read regaurdless of your beliefs."
5,Another way of thinking,"If you are looking for something this will give you another way to view your relationship with God, your wife, and others. I have enjoyed reading it."
5,God only creates originals,"I have read many books seeking to better understand my man. I always walked away feeling this is not about him, he is not the typical man. John Eldrege has focussed on the way God made and views manhood. Why am I surprised at how beautiful and original our God made each and every one of us. Trust me, if you are a women you don't want to miss this read. And if you are a man you will be liberated at how perfect your heavenly Father has made you.This book just gets better by the page and as it draws to the end you are excited to become the person God has created you to be."
1,Frustratingly Poor Index,"The index in this book is next to useless, the index is only 4 pages long and doesn't include any standard functions. So if you want to know the various format options to printf for example, you have to leaf through to find the right page in the appendix. Once you've found the entry in the appendix, there is no summary of the function, just a prototype and a Chapter number. So to get to a good description of a function, you find the appendix, leaf through it to find the most appropriate chapter and then leaf through that chapter. Totally unacceptable for a book marketed at the experienced programmer.Sections are called ""Start Up!"", ""Take That!"" and ""Go Ahead!"", which illustrates how unhelpful and inappropriate the layout and format of this book is."
2,Reading with Tequila,"Dancin' in the Moonlight is the ""werewolf"" book in the Still Sexy Ladies Guide to Dating Immortals series, all of which are written by different authors. The book was primarily sex scenes with bits of action thrown in. The sex was graphic at times, but never in a scorching, sexy way. The tone seemed to lean towards funny, but the humor mostly falls flat.The story is about a werewolf named Devlin who needs to find his one true mate in order to rule his clan. The mate is Tala, who falls for him even though her common sense tells her not to. Enter a brother who wants to stop their love in order to become ruler himself and a band of shifter hunters they all must escape.Sadly, there was nothing to distinguish this book from any other shifter tale other than a few minor gay and bisexual characters written into the novel with no purpose. It seemed as though they were added to compensate for the rampant homophobia and sexually oriented slurs coming from the hunters."
1,Too Much Info,"A fairly well-written book, but spends too much time evangelizing and sermonizing. I wanted something more factual and simply a straightforward historical reference guide for the non-religious. Something that would simply make a comparison bewteen facts in history and claims fo Brown. Also, too long. And, in my opinion, too expensive.This book, I must say though, is better than the one by Garlow and Barnes.But I'd try Abanes' short volume ""The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code,"" especially for non-scholars out there. Abanes is a bestselling, cutting-edge author who writes more for the popular market, gets to the point, and has great documentation. And it retail's for only $6.99 (JUST released)."
2,A startling omission,Buyer beware: This book does not deal with the question of Leonardo da Vinci's art at all. It's an evangelical attempt to exploit the popularity of this novel (Just as the Kellemyer book so shamelessly advertised below is a Roman Catholic attempt to cash in.)
1,Poorly Written,"As a conservative evangelical Christian, I was eager to read a scholarly refutation of ""The Da Vinci Code."" Regretfully, this book was a dreadful disappointment. It was so poorly written and painfully simplistic. The contents were terribly disorganized and lacked any coherent structure. It is obvious that the publisher sought to capitalize on the success of the ""The Da Vinci Code"" by publishing this waste of paper. Readers, beware! Don't be fooled by the enticing description on the book's cover! This book is a waste of one's time and money. I wish I could get my money back!"
2,The problem with this book..,"Is that the title is misleading. Several of the questions that ""everyone is asking"" are not even addressed in this book. The art issues are virtually ignored...Rosslyn Chapel...In addition, the perspective is distinctly evangelical, so, for example, in regard to issues of the ""spiritual feminine,"" Bock, presumably in order not to anger his evangelical audience (and CBA booksellers who are touchy about such things) misses the chance to drill Brown's deliberate ignoring of the place of the Virgin Mary in Christian history, devotion and spirituality."
2,Cut to the chase,"These books that are using the Da Vinci Code to advance another agenda really bug me. Just go through the book and clear up the mistakes, answer the questions. We don't need the evangelizing, and so on. I resent books like this."
2,Everyone's asking..,"After reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" - a lot of people are asking about Leonardo da Vinci's art, the Knights Templar, and so on.This book doesn't even try to answer those questions.Along with the other books cited, try Welborn's ""De Coding Da Vinci"" which is thorough, very well written and doesn't beat you over the head with Christian evangelizing."
1,Damage Control,"All one need do is read the blurbs at the beginning of the book to realize that this book isn't so much about refuting anything presented in The Da Vinci Code so much as is it's about doing damage control for what they perceive to be an attack upon the validity of their faith.One cannot refute the accuracy, or lack thereof, of any historical reference by summing it all up with faith, as I feel this book does by way of the last chapter. The mere mentioning of the word faith in a book claiming to deal with historical accuracies, quite frankly, removes all threads of credibility."
2,Only part of the story,"Bock is an evangelical, and it shows, even through his scholarship. His discussion of women and Christianity omits, oh,..2000 years of Catholic and Eastern Christian tradition. Hardly a word about art, Priory of Sion, Grail, etc. NOT the ""questions everyone is asking."" Only a couple of them.I want my money back!"
1,Almost as over hyped as Dan Brown's book,"Has society become so stupid that we need our fictional novels explained to us now? The Da Vinci Code is a fun read but it's fiction. It's FICTION. Do you really need someone to explain that to you? I'm wondering Bock himself understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction.Either way seems like Bock has found a way to milk even more cash out of people over this whole Da Vinci craze. And considering that I just saw him on television arguging over the Lost Tomb of Jesus. Well, I'm sure he'll come out with a book about that now. Get ready to fork over more money to him suckers."
1,Breaking the code.,"I regret buying this book, it is like reading an elementary school book. At no point did I feel as though I learned anythingnew. Save your money, if this makes it to paperback it will be amiracle. A fringe book riding the success of another author's work."
1,What a work of Dribble!,"All that Dr. Bock seems capable of is mouthing religious ideals.I bought this little book hoping to get a more detailed look into some of the views that were expressed in ""The DaVinci Code"". Instead a got a lecture on how right and pure the early church fathers were and pages of Dr. Bock's defense of his Christian faith.Dr. Bock should confine his writings to church publications and not try to make money off popular best sellers. Rather tacky!"
4,Bock is a Reliable Authority,"Bock, a past president of the Evangelical Theological Society and a faculty member at Dallas Theological Seminary, can always be depended on as a world class theologian. In this book he does an accurate job of conveying what Scripture and non-canonical writings say about Jesus. He is also aware of modern anti-Christian movements and how the publishing of ""TheDaVinci Code"" fits into their schemes to put down Christianity. I cannot recommend ""The DaVinci Code,"" but for those who have read it, this book is an excellent source to help them separate fact from fiction."
1,sad,"mr. bock doesn't do any good with his book. he lacks order, research and ways to get to the reader to explain his points of view. every chapters is left open leaving you without options, hints or even interest. as a christian i was expecting to find the answers the books says it will give. i was left only with more questions and what's worse, doubts. the book reminded me of preachers who speak and sound hollow. i took the da vinci code, as it is supposed to be, a novel. i have heard of all it's theories before, and thought interesting even though i don't think them true, but these book is so shallow and meaningless that it does wrong for the faith it's supposed to be defending."
2,keeps going off point and lingering,"Darell Bock keeps going off topic and repeating himself. While this is nice in the sense that he gives a LOT of evidence supporting his claims, it's no use if you are just a casual reader wanting to find out more. Thus, this book might interest you if youre an amateur in the field, but stay away if youre just an interested reader."
5,Very Nice!,I purchased this item elsewhere for a lower price including aluminum pulley wheels which admittedly influenced my rating somewhat. This is a very smooth machine with high quality parts. You will assuredly be pleased. I wuold 100% recommend this home gym.
5,NHL: Stanley Cup 2008 champions,"excellent!! I think the editing was perfect to sit and watch the hours of entertaining hockey at it's finest. Detroit out shot, out skated and scored more goals than the Penguins. Truly was the entertainment i was looking for in this video."
2,Misleading,"The title ""Detroit Red Wings Stanley Cup Champions Special Edition"" led me to believe that this DVD set included the season recap and championship video in addition to the finals games. I mostly wanted the recap, but I was willing to pay a few more bucks to have the recap and all the games from the finals. However as other reviewers have already pointed out, this is simply a bare bones DVD of the finals games with no special features, no regular season recap, no highlights from the other series, no intermission coverage, and no locker-room celebration after the win. Nothing but the actual games. Which is OK, but not what I wanted.Now to see the recap they want me to fork out another $20? Ridiculous."
1,What A Total Waste Of Money,"A Keson it is not. Not even close. CST / Burger and Stanley are even four times better than this. Having used this type of device professionally on jobs sites in the past, a measuring wheel was a logical choice for a one time big measuring job for a group I volunteer with. The first unit arrived broken. The packaging method was terrible but still I think a better unit would have survived. The second unit broke exactly where the first unit was broke, (where the handle mounts to the base of the unit) after pushing it about 300 feet on a soccer and baseball field. The base of the unit including where the handle attaches is made of plastic about as thick and of a similar kind to what you may find in an ice cube tray. Just the weight of the handle and the small amount of force used in pushing it along the ground is enough to break it. What a total waste of money. Get a Keson, CST/Berger or even a Stanley instead."
1,awful,this product is awful. used it about 4-5 times before the wheel fell off the handle and all the pieces holding it together broke. it made no sense because there was no force applied to the wheel to make it break. it just fell apart from simple uses. do not waste your money on this product. it is useless and a complete waste.
2,IS THIS AS GOOD AS IT GETS? VOLUME 2 NOT MUCH BETTER THAN 1!,"I saw Kiss in '78 and they had an amazing stage show. It's a shame the footage doesn't look or sound better on this set. Volume one wasn't any better. It's pretty low grade and this should not be the case as these shows go into the 90's! There should be better video available for shows this late. If they only had the forthought back then to record these shows better. It's hard to believe Kiss would not realize how important good quality footage would be now! This band spent so much money on a fantastic stage shows but, then they didn't tape the shows with top quality cameras? If these shows were professionally done they would have sold 100 times over this release and would be an incredible legacy left by the band. I'm glad to have it, but it should have been way better!"
3,KISS fan from Los Angeles,"Again KISS takes us for a ride.All the footage on this volume 2 dvd was available back in the mid 1990's during the KISS conventions on promo VHS tapes.So reality we seen all these footage before...nothing new.I was so excited from the rumors that a full ""Creatures of the Night"" concert was to be included in volume 2 from New Orleans 1983.Again did not happen.Why KISS decided not to...beats me.My only guess they proably don't have all the shows like they claim they do.If you're a mad KISS fan and have not seen this footage...then purchase it.I still don't know why the RIO 1983 show is not complete...I have the bootleg."
5,How can you rate somethinge before it is released,"You people make me sick. The DVD is not out yet but everyone has to see their posting gets on right away.Amazon should get with the program and not let anyone retarded with a keyboard rate something before it is viewed.I have the first set, it is awesome...I am sure this one will be to. I will wait UNTIL IT IS RELEASED TO REVIEW IT. Get a life and do the same."
3,Decent Footage?,"The reason why the Rio show is not complete is because Kiss did not have it profeesional shot. What had happened was local Brazilian TV stations documented Kiss' first time in Brazil, and Kiss agreed to have taped and later brodcasted later in the year. I have seen bootlegs of this show, and we will get about 50% of the show. These are the missing songs: Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, Love Gun, Shout It Out Loud, I Want You, I Still Love You. A little known fact that Paul had Vinnie intoduce Love Gun."
4,videos,"Kissology vol 2 is pretty good one. It was great seeing some of the music from the elder shown. I would like to see Kiss come out on dvd all of their videos like ""I was made for loving you"" and some other videos. It had a nice tribute of Eric Carr on there. I see that it didn't have to much on Mark St.John. I didn't see anything about the 4 original members getting together in 1988 doing a concert."
5,To All Kissology Complainers,"The Paul Lynde Halloween Special is coming out on DVD soon, which explains why ""Beth"" was not included in Kissology Volume One. Additionally, Tom Snyder specials have come out on DVD before, and I'm sure it's just a matter of time before the second half of the Kiss Interview is released as part of another Tom Snyder-themed DVD. It appears that Kiss was only given the right to show excerpts or parts of each. After all, who would buy the Paul Lynde Special or the Tom Snyder DVDs if the entire Kiss Interview and songs were on Kissology? The fact is that both volumes of Kissology are incredible and contain so much material, it's hard to believe that there are any complainers. I for one cannot wait for Volume III!!"
3,could have been better,this is a good item to have but it could have a better quality in mastering recording and edition.many videos are old and coudl have been restored better. i hope kissology 3 could have more improvement and many other videos left out in this edition. poor eric carr. RIP
5,The only down is not the full concerts,In volume one they had included complete concerts and I am not sure why they edited out all except the last concert???
3,Lip Syncing At Its Best,"Okay, I know that the Kiss Alive albums have all had studio touch-ups or have been recorded on soundstages etc. However when watching this video (and I'm only on the 1st Australian concert so far). It bugs me to watch and hear two different things. The volume output on the instruments are to be expeceted for 27 year old footage, however Paul's vocals are so overdubbed it's annoying. You see him jumping up and down away from the microphone while sustaining notes. Annoying. Leave the footage be. We know Paul is not going to sound as good because he is a very mobile vocalist. Let his voice cut in and out so we can re-live the live experience. Leave the Lip Sycing to Britney Spears and Milli Vanilli."
5,YES! I love this!,"I've had this stuff on VHS for many years, but now I have the DVD quality added to this KISSstory :) I watched Attack of the Phantoms last (since I knew it was the weakest part of the set) and I was suprised to say the least. They've added music from the solo albums (all 4 of 'em) to the dull/extremely boring moments of the movie, and this really helped my viewing experience to say the least. Whoever thought of this.... I'd shake their hand-- great idea. Fractured Mirror playing at just the right part--- Everything else was even better than expected too. The Sydney show really benefits from the DVD quality too (that never was one of my fav shows, but I've played this show about 4 times already!!). If you liked the first one of the Kissology set(and who didn't???), you should like this one too."
4,nice comeback,kiss dvd 2 is veary good it has everthing like the first dvd offerd i wish there was a little more footage though but hey its nice to see the attack of phatoms on here and the unmasking interview and comanteray is great to the shows are anazing u see the new line as well as the old line up all in all this is a greeat comeback dvd cant waite for the thrid dvd to com out
4,kissology 2,very very good however I'm not happy about it being censored meaning when Paul speaks live in concert some of IT is cut. why?
4,Um... Where's the rest of the stuff?,"I couldn't wait for this to arrive but after watching it, I felt short changed. Where the hell is the rest of the Tom Snyder interview? Where are the rest of the promo videos? What happened to the wonderful documentary from Australia ""The Inner Sanctum""? Why did they only include excerpts of ""Countdown""? What happened to Lick It Up, Animalize and Asylum? It felt like it jumped from one extreme to another! Does it sound like I'm complaining? Good! Because I am. When this is being promoted as the ""Definitive Kiss"" and alot of stuff is missing, how the hell can this be the ""definitive Kiss""? Four stars go to the sound, Kiss In Attack of The Phantom in Widescreen (!!!) and the packaging. Wow. I can't wait for Volume III (with such sarcasm)."
5,Rock and Roll All Night,I bought this item for my son's 39th birthday. He has been a huge KISS fan since he was 7. He is also a musician. He said KISS:Kissology Volume II was fantastic. He already has the other volumes.
3,Could have been better..........,"As with most KISS video projects this could have been alot better as most of the pro shot videos have been in collectors hands for years. Where was the Mark St.John concert footage or the full Lisbon,Portugal show instead of just 2 songs? The bonus materials and easter eggs fall totally flat and it's just dissapointing as with all the stuff KISS has supposedly taped over the years it could have been great but instead it just leaves you kind of limp. I mean they could have maybe put in some of the guitarists or drummer auditions after Ace and Peter left or stuff like that but no we get the Rio show which ever KISS diehard fan has seen a million times!! My final grade is a C+Earl"
2,Dissapointing as it's NOT a true summary of 78-91,"This isn't bad, but I am very dissapointed that Gene and Paul have decided to ignore 83-87 - those were my favorite years of KISSTORY!It would have made more sense to make this 78-'92, and include the Revenge ERA, since that would have bookended the Makeup-free era and set the stage for the reunion Era..."
3,Disappointing follow up,"""I was somewhat disappointed when I watched this set. Volume One far exceeds this one in material. Most of the stuff on this one are incomplete shows/interviews, and to make things worse, have been available for years in their entirety. It also claims that it's from 78-95, but in reality it skips 84-87, and 89-90. Due to this omission, there is no mention of the late great Mark St. John except for in the Kommentary, and an Easter egg found on disk 3. The only thing that this set really has going for it, is the Eric Carr material. There's a couple of really good drum solo's (which again have already been made available), a touching kommentary track by Gene & Paul regarding Eric, and at the end of the credits (or should it be kredits?), a great video of Eric in his hospital bed shortly after his heart surgery. He was a trooper and knew how to keep smiling through everything!!!"""
3,Solid but Lacking in a few areas...,"Overall this is good stuff. Great sound and video quality. My main beef is that the Love Gun and Alive II era are completely omitted. The only representation of that era (definitely the height of Kissteria) is a short news excerpt and ""Kiss meets the Phantoms"". I think they spent too much time in the Creatures and Unmasked era and could have included a complete show from the Alive II tour. That was their best stage show!"
2,There are better books for tea parties and intro to teas,"This book is geared for, and would be appropriately aimed at, young pre-schoolers who enjoy tea parties, coloring books, and simple hand drawn images. It would be good for young girls who would be interested in hosting Teddy Bear tea parties in their room. Images are in black and white, with a brief explanation of the picture below.It is not a comprehensive guide for tea and tea parties, but rather a hard back version of a coloring book. As such, if you are looking for something to add to a gift basket for a youngster this would be something to seek. But if you are looking at a guide to teach youngsters about tea or tea parties in general, there are other books that would be better choices. There is not much to this one other than roughly drawn images of a girl at a teddy bear tea, with drawings of things the author wishes to explain."
4,Charming!,"This was a charming and simple book in which children will learn some basics of tea and the joys of partaking it with friends. I loved the illustrations! Whether basic etiquette to table settings to conversational skills, this books depicts wonderfully the art of tea. I can hardly wait until my little girl is old enough to share tea parties with her dolls and myself!This book can be found at [...].* I received a complimentary copy of A Child's Introduction to Tea as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit [...] to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
5,An Excellent Book for children to share with their Parents,This book is a great addition to our family collection. It enables people to learn the value of yesterdays past times that are usually forgotten. A tea party makes your feel special. This book tells you what you need to know to enjoy a very special moment a a friend or family member. My daughter and I love this book. We have tea parties all the time now. It gives us a reason to stop and enjoy each others company.
3,"Insight on why men cheat, their wives and ""the other woman""","I did expect more from this book: their was good insight on why men cheat, why their wives stay and what possesses single women to allow themselves to get involved in these liaisons--but it was nothing that I had not already read somewhere else. What the author does is to encourage the wives to really take a good look at why they stay, and that unless your spouse works really hard with you to change the behavior, staying with the strayer is inevitably self-destructive. The one truth I found is that while infidelity need not be the end of your marriage and you may forgive, one does not forget and it does change your relationship forever."
5,A must have for the dedicated player,"I play in a pool league and a lot of tournaments. I would never use the house sticks during competitive play, so why should I rely on the house bridge? They are typically poor quality, overly abused and are often hard to find when you really need one. The bridge heads very from location to location and are often wobbly or broken.Using the bridge is often the worst aspect of a player's game, so using the same bridge every time you play or practice will significantly improve your ability to play with the bridge. Consistency is the key to continuous improvement.I bought one of these bridge heads and I attached it to one of the house sticks or my break stick. It attaches snugly, so it won't wobble when you are trying to shoot. It also has several locations for you to shoot from based on your needs.You want the bridge to be an extension to your game, not a handicap."
3,"Lots of groups, very few of ""their graphs""","This elementary introduction to group theory is supposed to be unique in its use of graphs to represent groups (Cayley diagrams), which would be an interesting and fresh approach to teaching group theory. But no, the authors don't deliver what they promised. It's the same old group theory, with a few Cayley diagrams thrown in here and there. Of the few Cayley diagrams that actually appear, many are so very trivial that they just seem stupid (C_n, Z, etc.). In fact there are only two nontrivial Cayley diagrams in the whole book: the quaternion group and the icosahedral group (last page)."
1,Lame Stuff,"Another ""The"" band the critics love to hate, The Lashes have officially hit the big time with their full-length debut, Get It. Boasting fruity pop with a side of Hot Hot Heat, Ben Clark and his band of hipsters have cut through my sister's diary with super cheesy guitar, chorus and lyrical content.Actually, my sister would hate the Strokes but would love the Lashes and not be able to tell you why. She's simply programmed to like this disposable, perfectly-produced pop with a side of rock. In fact, she would buy posters, CDs, t-shirts at their concerts and help the Lashes become a major success. This record is for her. I'm mailing it to rather than finishing a review. Enjoy sis."
4,I am a Lashes fan.,"Get It was long awaited by many patient...and in my case, impatient...fans. Now that its finally out, we can all party.This album is worth its weight in powerpop gold. Each song has something unique about it - for example, Nate's solo in Daddy's Little Girl. All of the twelve songs transition perfectly into one another; New Best Friend is an energetic opening to the album, and Wanna Girl is a satisfying finish.To clarify: there will be a lot of people who wont like this album. You can't take it too seriously, its just a slew of super fun, dancable pop songs."
3,A fascinating diversion,"This CD was in fact given to me by someone who claimed it was ""not to their taste"". Whilst I find such twentieth century items as are featured a little more palatable, I must admit that not all of it is to my liking. Eye-catching though the title may be, it does chafe that ""The Archbishop's Fanfare"" is itself barely a minute long (although it is very good- and remarkable in that I met the composer shortly after hearing it!). The three stars really go to James Lancelot for his playing- some of the pieces seem fairly standard, but others (for instance the Bossi ""Scherzo"" and the Langlais ""Incantation pour un Jour Saint"") are to be warmly commended for the skill with which they are executed. A fascinating diversion, in particular for organ enthusiasts."
4,Satisfied,Item as described -- price a bit high when compared with other web sites. I discovered this too late!
4,Thought Provoking,This book is great for those who want to learn more about the spiritual application of yoga.
2,"Great size and weight, but retractable part broke in day 1","I am the type that researches 100 things before buying something. It even takes me 5 minutes to buy toothpaste.So I finally settled on this JVC and I was excited.When I got it, it was great. Perfect size (I was worried that the retractable part was going to make it too big) and it worked for the entire day... and then when I went to retract it... it didn't retract. Like a yoyo that is too far extended, it never came back. I tried like 40 times. SO I haven't decided if I will return it for another one or try the Sony (which was sold out at the time)"
4,Nice faucet,"I read mixed reviews on this, then went ahead and ordered it. I don't regret it. While plumbers like Delta, I've never figured out why. Price Pfister makes good stuff. No, water doesn't squirt sideways--not after I cleaned the screen out when some debris accumulated. And if it reduces the water pressure somewhat--so what? My wife only knows to turn a handle on full tilt. If this slows consumption a little I'm glad. I'd give this a five star but we were hoping for a faucet with higher clearance--not just a high arc. Apparently high clearance is hard to find."
3,Lewis and Cark should have had this book!,"Residents and visitors alike can learn much from this tidy tome. Extensive treatment of natural history, economics, sights, tours, wineries, many other subjects make this more than a guidebook. Many entries include internet references for more and more up to date information"
1,"Horrible, find another way to back-up important data","I thought I got a bargain for this Terabyte drive. My OS is Windows Vista 32-bit. After a few months, my Dell XPS410 cannot detect the USB drive anymore. I have been scouring the Internet for this product's manufacturer-driver. The Simpletech website itself does not even have it. I have also been turning this item on and off until it pops-up, I even tried tweaking it using the Disk Management console, under the Administrative Tools of the Control Panel. I have already put alot of important data in this thing, but apparently I won't be seeing them again.1TB SimpleDrive USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (designed by Pininfarina)"
1,"Not worth the trouble, highly not reccomended","I bought this product expecting it to last longer than six months. Within the first week I had problems with the drive shutting itself off after about an hour, so I contacted support only to be met with a reply of ""Send it back and we can give you a new one."" Now, six months later, the drive has given out entirely, and will not even turn on. I tried contacting support again, this time with no response a full week later. I have filed my product for return, and do not intend to buy another. Can anyone say ""150gb of unrecoverable data down the tubes""?In short, this product comes packaged with one faulty drive, several gray hairs, no product support, and six months of broken use until it gives out and you can rejoice in the fact that you can go buy a drive from a better manufacturer."
5,Simple Tech SP UF35 1TB External Hard drive,This hard drive is very quiet and has performed well for me. I have not had any problems and have been very satifired.
5,kopitelto at his best,"After readind the reviews on this album i didnt know what to expect but being the kotipelto fan iam i decided to get it ,and wasnt let down. Yes some of the songs aint great but over all this is a fantastic cd.Great guitar playing and great vocals this cd is simply put fantastic.If your a kotipelto fan buy this cd iam sure you wont be let down . I hope this review was helpfull to you."
2,Interesting first solo effort,"Stratovarius fans were all wanting to hear this. So what do we get? Well, truth be told, a bit of a lightweight take on Stratovarius, who hadn't been that heavy themselves just prior to Timo Kotipelto putting out this effort. The main instruments on this album are keyboards and Kotipeltos' acquired taste of a voice which don't make for an outstanding work. However the fact that he has had the intestinal fortitude to put out what almost amounts to a concept album for a first effort shows someone with self-belief and you can almost sense the joy and happiness that was part of the process of creating this album. My tip - skip straight to his second album and if you like that then think of picking this up."
4,Good purse with lots of pockets,I purchased this purse to keep my stuff organized before a cruise. I was very pleased with the quality and the options for storing my items. Great bag!
3,A musical mystery,"Whodunit and Music Box Lovers will enjoy this mystery. It's brimming with Collector information.Dr. Thomas Prude thinks he made a fabulous deal on a rare music box. What he really gets is trouble when he learns he has a dead collector's stolen music box. After a visit to the widow of the late collector, Dr. Thomas is given some pictures... racy pictures. These will lead him into a mystery full of intrigue, sex and murder. When you read this book you will follow Dr. Thomas from Manhattan to London and through a mystery you won't forget.I had to laugh sometimes at Dr. Thomas's humor - he sounds like a guy who could get a way with crowning a lady with a ball peen hammer. I also enjoyed following his relationship with his wife, especially in the last chapter...."
1,You'll be Buying this Product Over and Over,"Here's the deal with Quickbooks if you have any employees and a payroll. Buy and install the the latest version, then you have to shell out (more) bucks a year (even if you have just one employee) to keep your tax tables updated. This tax table service used to cost just $($$$); you are at their mercy if you want to run with the latest tax tables. Now it is 2-3 years down the road and you get a message saying that you need to upgrade your entire Quickbooks package because tax tables will not be produced for your version after a certain date. Round and round the cycle goes....I think I have spent over $1000 in the past 6 years on Quickbooks versions and tax table updates. There is certainly a market out there for some sharp programmers to produce less expensive tax table updates for prior versions of Quickbooks. Be warned....Intuit makes Microsoft look good!!"
2,Quick Books Stinks,"Quickbooks is an easy program to learn. Tech. support can answer questions that any one can find the answers in the help menu. Quickbooks cannot track workman's comp, itemize payroll garnishments (if 2 or more employees are garnished from the same agency). Data will loose integrity if your file is too big or running a network. When I upgraded from QB99 to QB2001, I had to get my payroll updated online(with a subscription). I pay enough money to keep my business running, I don't like having to shell out extra's that I believe should come with the $(dollar amount) per computer for the program. I also feel that there must be something a lot better than this program for the construction/contractor business. I am definately not upgrading. I have had many thoughts of using this CD for drink coasters in my living room. Do some research before buying this product."
1,"Try fact 2000 pro Belgium cheap,easy euroincluded andsoon","I previously used quickbooks, untill the euro came, and quickbooks had no answer for me. I don't like also software asking for money after a buy already . Disappointed is the good word that i like to include this software after several years good cooperation still. Few interactions in customer- info findings, item deviding, and not easy mastering sorry intuit you lost a thankfull customer years to go maybe with some cooperation Dr Jansen Veterinary surgeon Belgium"
2,"Great Product, Terrible Support","Great product when it works, but if you have a problem with their downloads, or tax upgrades, even with a new version, don't expect any help unless you buy their...Premium Support Service. In fact no one at QBooks will want to talk to you unless you give them a credit card number if you don't have Premium Support. Their warranty is -0- at day one, but you don't find out till you open the box. They admit to be willing to help with a new product, but YOU HAVE TO PAY by the minute via credit card, or sign up for their premium Support, which they highly recommend.If the Qbooks has no gliches, then it a 5 star product."
2,Good accounting package -big time system resource hog,I updated to Quickbooks 2001 approximately 3 weeks ago. I used to be able to have other applications open and go to Quickbooks and do an Invoice. I no longer can do that. I have to have all other applications closed for Quickbooks 2001 to work without freezing up my computer or giving me a warning of low system resources.I have a current computer also Dell 8100 Dimension 256meg ram/40gig HD/1.3ghz processor. So it isn't my computer that is at fault.So users that want to upgrade beware of the fact: not being able to do multiple applications if you are in Quickbooks 2001.
1,Why they sued Microsoft,"I never understood the Microsoft lawsuit till I bought this. Imbedded in the quickbooks program is an exclusive Internet explorer 5.5 that has to be installed to make Quikbooks work. No other version will do. Infact trying to use an other version of 5.5 corrupted other functions beyond Quickbooks, which won't run without it.. It is constantly checking with Intuit if you are on line even if Quickbooks isn't open and downloading updates. It always wants to update your program: don't do it! Then you have to update all your files (up to half hour) and then they cannot be used on a machine that is not at the same update level."
2,"Great Product, Costumer support terrible!!!","I called to receive assistance on a system error msg. This was a relatively simple issue. The software knowledgebase and various sources on the site did not provide any help! After calling the help line and going through a careful screening process, I was given the choice to sign up for the annual support ($395.00 or pay on a per time basis($40/10 min). I chose the 2nd option and the tech support asked me to fax a file for his review. His fax number did not respond for about 20 minutes and then after the receipt of the fax I was told my cost so far is $120.00 (for 30 min). He then gave me the option to let him review the file which may cost $250 box or let one of the software specialist review for a cost of $750. I found the whole process very unethical. Buyers beware!!!"
4,Like it,The Art of Shaving Hydrating Toner does not really have purpose to me. It does feel good on the skin. Don't buy if you don't need it.
1,We're being ripped off...,Why bother remastering so you get a decent picture? Why bother making sure the complete unedited versions are there? Why bother with any of it. Just stick it in a box and sell it. All those idiots who love the show will buy it no matter. The TV show of course is excellent. The presentation is pathetic. Yes the interviews were wonderful but do NOT make up for the rest. Shame on those responsible!
1,Albert arrives..........,".....and ""Little House"" jumps the shark.Orphan, thief, liar, morphine addict and murderer [well, he DID set the fire that killed Alice Garvey AND the Ingall's grandson!]""Albert"", arrives in Walnut Grove, and the show rapidly sinks to the bottom of the dumpster.WHY Michael Landon decided to yet AGAIN deviate from the original story and bring in Albert, is a mystery he [Landon] took to his grave. The addition of Albert added nothing to this once great series.I stopped buying the series at season 4. You should too."
3,Enjoyable but quality could be better,"Compared to the first season of Little House, the fifth season has gone downhill as far as picture quality and continuity from one scene past commercial breaks to another scene. I think the people who make these DVDs are getting tired and sloppy! The picture is not as clear as season one and I feel like I am getting ripped off on the end of certain scenes that they just abruptly cut off. I still love to watch but a DVD should be better than this."
3,Cut Episodes?,"DVD Box sets are for complete episodes not edited ones. If we want edited episodes, we can get a DVD burner and record the Hallmark Channel. The several minutes missing from the second disk, The Hallmark Channel just showed the 2 parter where they leave the city ro return to Walnut Grove and it had all the missing footage that is gone from the DVD. It was shown 8/13th 2005. I guess I will have to tape it burn a new DVD myself inserting the missing footage. No wonder the sets are so cheap compared with others. The cuts are terrible. The DVD's freeze and lock up some DVD players also. Three stars for poor DVD set. The show gets 5 stars of course.Dean"
5,little house on the prairie season 5,A BRILLIANT BOX SET AND I ADVISE EVERYBODY TO BUY ALL 9 SEASONS AS THEY ARE JUST AS ENJOYABLE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
5,Classic family show,Little House was one of my favortie shows growing up. My friends and I would read the books during the day and watch the show at night every week. I bought the set for myself but I look forward to introducing my young daughter to it one day. A must have for your DVD library.
5,Littel House - Season 5,"I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I have not watched them, but did enjoy the originals when they were on TV. She loves the whole series."
1,Not if Mr. Landon were still alive!,"The production of these shows is garbage. They have gotten worse in quality each Season... Many worse than VHS tape... Netflix has even PULLed all Season 5 discs from their service...As Michael Landon was the producer and sometimes director and always the STAR of this show I am sure he would NEVER have let his series be sold to us in this horrible condition... I'd expect this from some reality TV show... But not ""Little House"". This show as always about doing the right thing above all... The current owner of this material should be ashamed for dumping such a highly loved show about MORALITY onto the market in this condition just to make a buck. We all deserve a public apology and new versions of the shows when they are properly redone..."
3,Horrible Cutting And Horrible DVD Quality,"Who on earth made these DVD transfers? They should be ashamed of themselves. What an embarrassing attempt at putting a quality television series on DVD. I have collected many 70's TV shows on DVD and none, and I mean none, are even half as bad as the quality of these DVDs. Also, the editing of the episodes is inexcusable. For example, during the Cheaters episode Andrew is walking home from school with Laura and Albert after receiving a poor grade on his test. The DVD shows them walking up a dirt path and then it is CUT!!!!! I know there is some more dialog on the original episode. The dialog that was cut was about Andrew showing anger at Albert for scoring high on the test. This is just one example. I'm sure there are more. Where there's smoke there's fire. This show deserves much better treatment but it looks like it was put together by a bunch of 10 year olds on a student project. The show deserves 5 stars but the quality deserves 0."
1,Unusable,"The print of the commentary on this leather bound edition is too small to be of any practical use. The images avialble on the ""look Inside"" feature are misleading. I had to return it."
4,"Fast delivery, pretty good quality",I'm satisfied with the seller. I got very quick service at a good price. My only quibble is that the book was described as like new and with the dust jacket. The actual book had no dust jacket and was detached a little from the binding. But I didn't complain because I plan to read it a lot and generally am hard on books. It does look new.
4,Ali's Qur'an Provides A Window into Islamic Worldview,"I've found this version of the Qur'an more helpful than other's I've tried. Ali's version is replete with notes and appendicies that explain difficult aspects of Islamic culture. Though Ali lived in the early part of the 20th century, modern editors have added notes where they feel Ali's own comments are dated. Ali's edition is an authenticly Islamic verison of the Qur'an.A word of caution though: Ali does not hide his Islamic prejudices concerning Jewish and Christian scripture and culture. This gives Westerners a window into an authentic Islamic worldview. In the end, I think most Westerners will find that this worldview is a sympathetic one."
3,The book is in great shape but it's not imitation leather.,I ordered this Quran for work and although it's nice it isn't what was listed. The one listed was imitation leather and this one is a hard back.
3,Book was not new,"I have to give a three because the book was not new like promised. I know this because there was a personal letter written to someone on the first page of the book, which is annoying to see everytime you open the book."
5,Been Reading these reviews....,"You muslims crack me up. I laughed my but off reading some of these reviews. How can you muslims blast the anti-muslim reviews as being ""intolerant"" when you quote the koran one minute and spue hatred towards christians and jews the next. And you expect people to accept your religion and join? You all need a good PR person to teach you how to deal with people. Lighten up...Funny"
5,Why Hate My Country?,"I served this country in Vietnam and retired from the USAF after 21 years of active service. When I see my country being mocked below by persons who spit on our freedoms and our way of life, I want to say: ""I will gladly buy you a first class plane ticket to whatever Islamic state or country you may wish to move to"". You ingrateful people. You have and enjoy all of our nation's freedoms but you write reviews here blasting the very country you prosper in. If you hate christians and Jews so much I promise to send you a plane ticket to whatever Islamic state you wish to go to so you do not have to even see them.I read these fanatics below and I think - is THIS what I fought for?"
5,An excellent translation and commentary,"Contains the text of the Quran and commentary - about half the page is commentary. This is not verse by verse commentary; the difficult passages are explained.An example of commentary: ""If the object of a Message is to make things clear, it must be delivered in the language current among the people to whom the Messenger is sent. Through them it can reach all mankind.""My understanding of this comment is: The Jews received the Message in Hebrew; the Romans in Greek (which was the literary language of Rome) and the Arabs in Arabic.The translation is very good and agreeable to read."
4,The best Koran for somebody learning Arabic,"The Arabic script is big enough to actually read! The choice of script is also good, in that it is not overy ornate and very much like that used in popular books for learning Arabic. There is also some interesting commentary that does not seem over the top."
5,Classic from a Giant of Anatomy.,This is an important reference for medical students and residents. It is helpful for developing an understanding of the anatomy of classic general surgery cases. Wonderful bridge from medical school classroom to the operating room.
3,Missing something?,"This came in handy AFTER my urological rotation. Yeah, NOTHING on prostates, vasectomies, torsions. I was SO pissed. Not much on plastics either but that I'll let slide."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,"Babyface is done and I highly recommend that you purchase something else other then this piece of garbage that he recorded. This CD is so bad that I took it back to the store with in an hour of purchase. Babyface lost his groove when he decided to record a country folk cd. It appears that ""IT IS OVER""!!!!! He lost his soul in his sound and songs. I heard of crossing over, but he crossed all the way over and lost his mind after him and L A Reid broke up. Maybe it was L.A.'s ear for hot tracks and beats that made Babyface what he use to be. But to be honest.....the Tender Lover days are totally over and this CD should be taken out to a country pasture and taken out of it's misery."
3,Still Going,Not like his former stuff BUT still good for all Babyface fans out there. To be honest the man could sing the alphabet song and it would still sound cool to me. Its just his style....cool.
4,Well Rounded!.,"This is a great CD !!. he has done it again, these are some the artist and songs that inspired him to write those off the chain love ballads and smooth dance tunes!. I think this is a good tribute CD and also has a few song original from babyface."
2,just ok,"i go way back with digging Babyface's music from the days of the Deele. then his solo career and also him and LA Reid Writing and Producing for a whole lot of other folks and then Face's Solo Writing and Producing for others,etc... but this collection which is the ""in"" thing to do as a veteren Artist of doing Covers which usually says that a artist has ran out orginal material and this is a safe way of selling records. the playing and Production is cool,but nothing really stands out to me. I dig ""When can I see you again"" back in 93/94 and then when Face worked with Eric Clapton on ""Change the World"" and also Babyface with Stevie Wonder on ""how come,How long"" but none of these covers to me are touching those songs. it just feels kinda there. not bad in instrumentation and vocals,but that signature Babyface touch he use to present is MIA."
3,"Not all of ""PLAYLIST"" made my Playlist","I purchased this after watching BABYFACE live with Eric Clapton, and again with Trisha Yearwood. I enjoy only four of the tracks from PLAYLIST. I was disappointed. If Babyface is going to do covers of J.Taylor, Clapton, etc, he should have recorded with these artists on CD. That would be a truely fantastic CD.This isn't the worst CD I've ever purchased. Personally if I could do it over, I'd buy & download only the individual tracks I liked."
2,"Where is Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds?","I bought this CD because to date I have loved everything that Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds has put out. This is the first CD that I absolutely do not care for. I knew going in that the music listed on the CD wasn't music I cared for, but I was anxiously awaiting to see what kind of spin Mr. Edmonds would put on the music to make it his own. From the first to the last song, I don't like the CD. I don't feel that Mr. Edmonds stepped outside of his comfort zone to make these songs uniquely his own. Rather he took the music and performed it as writtem/"
3,Product Great but company not so much,I love the picks but they were shipped loosely in a box and a few fell out during shipping.
5,Finally some Relief!,"After living with Migraine Disease for 22 years (I am now only 26) this book has provided me with some answers. I have been suffering from chronic daily headache for the past four years. I picked up this book one weekend and could NOT put it down. Within a week, I was on the recommended Web sites, found a recommended doctor in my area and got in to see him. I've been headache-free for 2 days now! That might not seem like much to some people but to me, it feels like forever! Thank you Teri!"
5,Teri has written a gem of a book for people with Migraines and/or Headaches!!,"Bravo Teri!!! This is an excellent book, easy to read and understand, and filled with useful information and guidance! I have read many books about Migraines and Headaches that were cold and seemed so impersonal! Teri writes like she's known you for years and is just there sharing her personal experiences.I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this book and all that Teri does for those of us trying to live with Migraines and/or Headaches. Thank you Teri!!!I recommend that everyone who has or knows someone who has Migraines and/or Headaches read this book!!!!"
4,Migraine Disease and Headaches,"Living Well with Migraine Disease and Headaches has presented some facts about migraines which were interesting to me. As to how helpful it will be, I really don't know. I am an older woman who has had migraines for 49yrs so most preventatives have been tried on me. At the present time I am only trying to cope with the headaches with pain medication and complete bedrest."
3,Not much new info than you would get from your doctor,"If you are indeed suffering from Migraine, chances are that you have visited a few doctors and have also done basic research on the ailment. This book does not add too much information to what you may already know. In my case, this was meant for a friend who is suffering from Migraine. Since I do not suffer from Migraine and have never researched on it, I found the information useful but my friend did not. He knew most of the information here but the table of trigger foods was somewhat helpful to him. Overall average if you are just finding out that you have Migraine."
5,Continuing Education,"As a migraineur, I was not aware that migraine headaches are so varied and have now been given names. This information has alleviated my stress and described my types of migraines so accurately that I no longer fear I have meningitis or a brain tumor. Also, I have delayed applying for a disability for over a year because my symptoms do not match the designation criteria as per the US Social Security office. I now see however, that it is possible to apply, with medical verification, and obtain monetary relief for my suffering."
3,more conceptual and technical than data oriented,"The book tends to dwell on insignificant, technical matters. Specific data on specific foods is vague and sketchy. A diet book, to be five star, should provide data for at least two levels of difficulty (i.e. a fast paced diet and a moderately paced diet). For each level, at least 200 or 300 common foods should be rated. Portion sizes should be specified. This book covers all the research but does not provide near enough data on specific foods for someone that is dieting. To top it off, the author has an irritating habit rephrasing just about everything."
5,Brilliant AND Accessible,"A must-read for lawyers, academics, theologians, and curious human beings alike, God vs. The Gavel competently and thoroughly lends insight to the issue of religion and its relationship to the United States Constitution. Professor Hamilton, through her lively style of writing, argues that religious groups should not receive heightened constitutional protection when their actions harm others. While this theory is a seemingly simple and practical one, Hamilton successfully draws her readers into an intricate -- indeed intriguing -- web of religion, law, and their interplay in contemporary society. Easy to understand yet sophisticated in scope, Hamilton's work is a truly impressive accomplishment, and one that is sure to draw attention around the country and across the globe."
1,"Must-Read Review of ""God vs. the Gavel""","Anyone who has read this book or is thinking of reading this book should try to get his/her hands on the review of it by Douglas Laycock, entitled ""Syllabus of Errors,"" published in volume 105 (2006-2007) of the Michgan Law Review (starting at page 1169). Prof. Laycock exposes the book's serious, multiple errors of fact. His concluding assessment is worth quoting:""Occasional errors are inevitable, but here the extraordinary number of errors, often with reference to famous cases and basic doctrines, implies a reckless disregard for truth. I document these errors for a reason. No one should cite this book. No one should rely on it for any purpose. You might use its footnotes as leads to other sources, but take nothing from this book without independent verification."""
2,Marci Hamilton's Book,God vs The Gavel provides compelling arguments but could be edited into a more compact book. The supports for the thesis are well chosen and well described for the most part. The middle of the book bogs down a bit. The summary is well done and important to read.
1,Ridiculous and unbelievable--I'd give it minus 5 stars if possible,"Awful, awful, awful. Poor writing, an absurd plot, and too many imbecilic characters populate this poor excuse for a thriller. Again and again the characters do things that are unbelievable. Here's an example: After receiving a video of her boyfriend having sex with Melody and learning that Melody (who isn't really ""Melody"" but a sociopathic liar named Jessica whose story is as stupid as the rest of the book) might be the killer, Carolyn, our intelligence-challenged heroine, goes rushing over to confront Melody. After an inane conversation Carolyn sees that Melody is wearing the same watch that she (Carolyn) received for Christmas from said boyfriend. This helps Carolyn decide that Melody is not a threat. The finale is absolutely ludicrous. Don't waste your time on this."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Carolyn Sullivan is a probation officer for Ventura County. Her artist brother, Neil, is suspected in the murder of his girlfriend and another woman. Neil was with Melody Asher, a spoiled heiress who has perfected the art of lying, when his girlfriend was murdered, but Melody won't provide his alibi.Work wise, Carolyn is trying to crack Raphael Moreno, a truly gruesome killer. As the story unfolds it turns out Raphael and the new killings are connected all because of a Ferrari.There are so many subplots - Carolyn's love life; a revelation about Carolyn's father's death; the plutonium; Melody's dad and their relationship; etc. etc. - that it's all just a little much...even for fiction."
3,"Great Plot, Strange Character","Overall, the novel's mystery is its strong point. The clever weaving of several subplots with carefully constructed clues is well done, and left me guessing well into the end of the novel. That being said, I found the main character to be a bit too gutsy--there's brave and then there's unnecessary risk. Particularly if you are a single parent of two children. I also apparently don't understand why someone with her bravery and experience, not to mention propensity for solving crimes, would elect to be a probation officer rather than a police officer since her skills were described as interrogation and investigation.I'm glad I read it and I think it was a good use of free time, but at the end of the day I don't like the main character enough to continue reading the other books in the series and be subjected to more of her superwoman antics."
3,Too convoluted,"I could tell the story was trying to be a good one and maybe if it had been better written it would have succeeeded, but as is as far as this reader goes it was very convoluted and hard to get a handle on which made me put more effort into it that I wanted to and with no return. It's just ok and I won't be reading it again or particularly recommending it to anyone."
3,just an o.k. read,"it seems to me that the author ran out of an idea for the ending so she threw in plutonium for the grand finale, i read the book because it was free, had i spent any money on it i would be very unhappy."
1,Pew!,"This book must have been written by a high school freshman. I will gave it one star for excellent spelling throughout the entire book. The content, however, can be summed up in one word: TRITE. I downloaded the book as a Kindle Freebie. It is worth every penny I spent."
4,Be enthralled!,"Starting with the snippet of radio-broadcast speak in ""7-5,"" the audience knows immediately that this is not a casual listening experience.From the rollicking beats of ""Khaleegi Stomp"" and ""Yellow And Black Taxi Cab"" to the absolutely giddy acid trip narration of ""Drinking In Gomorrah"" to the cheeky-yet-dead serious homage of ""Take The A Tram"" (referencing Duke Ellington's Harlem-visit masterpiece "" ""Take the 'A' Train""), TGU puts a masterful world-music, political-conservatism-be-damned spin on Arab rock and roll!Spin this disc and dance, listen to the lyrics, or clean the house....either way you will be enthralled!"
1,Complete junk...,I'll be returning right away. Suction cup does not hold at all. Completely useless...
1,Not the original artists; don't be fooled like I was!,"There was no indication in the description that these songs are not by the original artists. It was only after I received the CD that I saw ""performed by Countdown"" at the bottom of front cover. I wish Amazon (and other sites) would make it clear exactly who the performers are on a ""various artists"" CD."
2,What's the point?,"These are great tracks, certainly. But why are these constantly reissued? These are the first two Flying Burrito Brothers album tracks with a few extras thrown in, nothing more. (Yawn)"
5,Great for use with the Wahl,"I bought this as an additional attachment for my Wahl 2-Speed massager, because the attachments that come with that product are all made of a porous material and I wanted something higher-quality. This one works great and conducts the vibrations well. It's also softer/squishier than the regular Wahl attachments."
3,Informative,Fount this to be very informative but presented with a lot of talking on and on. Questions by children at the end appeared quite staged. Info on how to stand and hold the bat and how to determine the type of bat that is good for you was great. Punting described well with a how to avoid it going foul. Not much on how to improve your actual hitting stats.It was informative and interesting but we found the two other DVDs on pitching and fielding more demonstrative and they held our interest more.
1,Don't waste your money.,"I was so excited to try this based on the other review here but to my disappointed surprise, this is just terrible tasting jelly. It MUST be an acquired taste. Several of my coworkers tried it too, because I thought I would just give it to someone, and not a single one liked it. Four of us tried it and one described it as like walking into a room recently sprayed rose scented air freshener and getting choked up on it. Definitely do not recommend."
4,More than just facts,"This is a well organized and comprehensive compendium to Washington State. The author has gathered an impressive array of information, from economic and geographic information to touristic suggestions and interesting factoids from past and present.The author has an upbeat and informative writing style that makes you want to read the book, not just look something up.This is a great gift for Washington residents or wannabe residents."
1,Awfull!!!!,"Don't bother, not enough ice skating to satisfy the skating fan and not enough gymnastics to satisfy the gymnastics fan!"
5,"Beautiful, an old favorite","I bought the cassette when I was a teenager and recall listening to it countless times. I enjoyed every single track on this album; which can't too often be said of any kind of music, really. The short samples available really don't do them justice. They are all rather long and complex songs and they're all beautiful. I bought the album on a whim, so really I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I didn't just listen to it to relax, but I listened to it because I loved the music. Now I have many good memories associated with this album.I highly recommend this to anyone who desires beautiful instrumental music to either relax and clear your mind or to simply enjoy. Some of the songs are quiet and soothing and some are boisterous and joyful. And some are a combination of both."
5,Great for practical applications,"This book provides a nice balance of math, examples, and MATLAB computer. It was of great help for me to understand and code up my own forms of ANNs. The example code provided is a really nice feature. It also puts a great deal of emphasis on relating statistics with ANNs."
5,Keeps me comfortable,I love these strap keepers. They hold my bra straps from falling even in long sleeve shirts. They are great for sleeveless tops and dressy clothes. I won't be wothout them.
1,waste of money,"I didn't know what to expect with this product as there wasn't a good description. As one person said, essentially band-aids w/o the gauze. The shipping cost more than the product, and it arrived in a small flat mailer usually only $2 to mail. I was expecting something reusable and practical. I'll use them, but won't buy again. Get the Fashion Forms Strap Connection instead if you want something reusable and won't slip."
5,Economic Eye Opener,"Dr. Younkins exposes to the world the truth behind the current United States entitlement system. The easy to read chapters discuss each aspect of a capitilistic system in its purest form. Each chapter builds on each other allowing the reader to discover the mirage of free enterprise in this country.This is a very good book and Ed has been able to lubricate the previously dry subject of economics. Any person who believes that Americans live under a free enterprise system should read this book. If you believe that you are entitled to some economic aid from the ""Government,"" read this book."
5,Stimulating Learning,"In his works, Dr. Younkins has created a clear and concise piece of material. This book offers a straight-forward account of the foundations of free enterprise. Through this book, one is able to fully understand such subject matter as ownership, progress, governance, the obstacles to a free society, and the relationship between the individual, the community, and the state. Capitalism and Commerce truly leaves the individual with a sense of the meaning of ""the common good"" of society, personal flourishing and happiness, and a solid summary of the ideals of collectivist thinkers. I would recommend this book to any current or aspiring business man or woman, lawyer, or simply for anyone who loves the freedom of capitalism!"
5,economía en su más fino,"He tenido el honor de sentarse en clase del Dr. Younkin mientras que discutimos capitalismo y comercio como se dice ""socratically."" En detalle, recuerdo una clase donde tuve que presentar en el capítulo en ""justicia"" y yo cínicamente me trajimos a todos los libros (filosófico, económico, político, legal, etc) esos habíamos adquirido sobre mis cuatro años hasta el momento en rodar Wheeling Jesuit para ilustrar cuánto más fácil sería apenas leer el libro del Dr. Younkin. Más importantemente, el libro agarra los conceptos generales de la economía política contemporánea mientras que incorporar las ideologías de los otros ""grandes pensadores políticos"" de las épocas idas por el calibre ""obra maestra"" del Dr. Younkins y está parado a distancia con los muchos intelectuales en la aplicación el capitalismo. ""Kudos"" al autor para una adaptación bien-escrita, simplificada en la economía libre."
5,A moral case for capitalism,"We all know capitalism works, that it creates wealth and encourages prosperity. But Younkins shows, with clear and thoughtful arguments, that capitalism is also an essential element of the moral life of a liberal society. In a series of short, crisp chapters, it lays out the case for natural rights, negative freedoms, free markets, and a narrowly limited government. These elements of the capitalist system, he contends, are good not only for the wallet, but also for the soul. Capitalism, he writes, ""not only generates enormous wealth but also creates an environment in which morality and virtue can flourish."" This book should be required reading for college students. A great accomplishment."
1,It portrays them poorly. my brother Hezikia is upset.,i personly along with my puritan brothers and sisters am disturbed by the falseness in this book. we do not live as it is printed. my ancesters did not either. i wish we would stop being judged in this matter. we are tired of the jokes and it hurts our feelings.
4,What's not to love about a Mahalia Jackson CD?..,"I bought this CD and Volume II back in 2002. My mother loved Mahalia Jackson, so I grew up listening to her in vinyl round the clock it seemed. I actually thought I couldn't stand to hear another Mahalia Jackson song as long as I lived. But as an adult, I found myself humming some of the songs my mother had played over and over, and one day I realized I missed Mahalia's voice. When I bought these collections of hers, I actually went searching specifically for Mahalia Jackson music. Imagine my mother's surprise when I told her I had Mahalia Jackson blasting in my house the way she'd done when I was growing up! :-) There are still more Mahalia Jackson songs that I'm looking for that, in all the songs on these collections, weren't included. That's my only disappointment with these. But the quality of the recordings -- classic Mahalia!"
4,Mahalia Reigns,Purchase of this set was for musical experience rather than the religious message. Therefore Disc 2 is the highlight and Disc 1 more for those after religious inspiration.
4,Mahalia Jackson Gospel Spirituals & Hynms,"This is a much needed CD, recorded by one the most widely known artists of her time. Mahalia Jackson owned the particular idiom of spirituals, gospel and hymns. She has, as with other recordings, preserved a heritage that could have been lost but for such recordings.Her power of communication, feeling and interpretation are excellent. They convey such a rich, meaningful pattern of hope, longing and faith. It was said that Marion Anderson had a voice that came only once in a century. Mahalia Jackson's voice shares that same distinction."
1,"MAHALIA JACKSON, GOSPELS, SPIRITUALS AND HYMNS","Purchased with 2 other of Jackson's CD's we found this one to be the most disappointing. Too loud and raucus for our taste. Our one and only recording of Mahalia is ""The Power and the Glory"" with the Percy Faith orchestra, a wonderful rich and moving experience, and we were hoping for the same with our current 3 purchases. Definitely not the same quality we were expecting. We didnt mind the other 2 but really dont like this one at all, sorry."
4,fortunate meeting twice,"Adorable & funny romantic movie. A movie to watch with your guy/lady......just the two of you. The movie seems to go by so fast because there's always something good happening in most scenes. Based in the past 20 years, this movie would be in my top 10 Funny Romantic Comedy List. What a great friend Molly Shannon (former cast in SNL) is in this movie. As for not giving all 5 stars rating: dvd movies should be available in Full Screen as well. ...or even better: every dvd movie comes in both full and widescreen (just to make everyone happy). That's probably the only neg. thing I can say about the DVD feature, but the actual movie is great!"
4,Special Night with Someone,"Serendipity, is a romantic comedy that is a good movie to watch with that special someone. IT is perfect for a nice quiet evening. The movie can be corney at times but just keep an open mind to it."
5,Excellent,"Very predictable and of a similar line to movies of the same tale, however, funny and delightful. John Cusack is excellent and proves why he is one of the s=best actors around and Kate is just sexy.A charming surprise after reading reviews that slate this film. If not seen, it is a must.Watch this film"
4,An unfortunate accident,"Shortly after Sara meets Jonathan, she tells him that serendipity, one of her favorite words, means ""a fortunate accident."" That two people who feel themselves ""click"" in a special way together can walk away from one another without having more to hold onto of the other's identity than a glove, is definitely an UNfortunate accident. Sara believes in letting fate decide what will happen between the two. And while the ""signs"" and ""clues"" that fate throws their way when they spend all those years apart are fairly believable and quite enjoyable to watch, what happens is predictible. Even so, it doesn't stop you from impatiently awaiting the grand finale when not fate, but love - will prevail."
5,A UNIQUE LOVE STORY,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's a great love story, and it's different from most of them. It has a great story to it, if only life was really like that. Letting the hands of fate determine who you are going to be with and who your love will be. John Cusack did a great job as usual. I loved Jeremy Piven as the part of his best friend, he is hilarious! Not a sappy moment in the whole movie. The ending was good, but predictable, I mean of course they're going to get together, this is a romantic movie we are talking about here. This movie is full of parts that make you go ""They're so close!"" Loved it!"
2,A romantic comedy without much romance and even less comedy,"Start with the terrific, self-deprecating John Cusack, add the beautiful Kate Beckinsale with NYC as a backdrop, and this film had huge potential. Unfortunately, the film is a flop.Three big flaws:1. Main characters - neither is very likeable (this is no Harry met Sally)2. Plot - they ""just miss"" each other too many times. This becomes silly and is too much to endure.3. Pacing - so slow that the tension is exchanged for tediumOne high point: The two main characters do have nice chemistry when together.Unfortunately, this is not enough to carry the film."
3,Female lead poor,"Need a different female lead, casting was poor. Movie is good. xxx xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx"
5,Amazing,Well written and a true love story about how fate works and that you should never give up hope. Great acting as well!
3,Transfer is rather poor,"The transfer used for the Blu Ray is rather poor and, by the looks of it, old. No detail, no sharpness, no proper film look. Marginally better than a good DVD, but that is not good enough for HD on Blu Ray. At least it's cheap as it should be when a studio recycles old masters like this."
4,If Life only worked this way.......,This is a great John Cusack movie (but aren't they all!). If life were only this way.I highly recommend this movie
4,"PETER CHELSOM, OPUS 5","**** 2001. Directed by Peter Chelsom. A few years after their only encounter in NYC, a man and a woman who believe in signs and in Destiny are in search of each other on the eve of their respective marriage. Great feel-good romantic comedy for the whole family."
4,Great movie!,This movie is definitely a chick flick--but both guys and girls will learn to love this movie--it has one of the 'fate' plotlines.
4,Breezy romantic comedy.,"Serendipity starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale is a sweet love story, of course it's not as brilliant as other romantic comedies. This one tries too hard and comes across cheesy after a few viewings but overall, Serendipity is a classy story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy finds girl again and they live happily ever after. I am a woman who enjoys romantic comedies even though the outcome and the formula is always the same, but Beckinsale is a pretty girl and Cusack is a great actor so that helps. Defintely one to watch if you are having a girls night out. Hope you like it."
4,Connect the dots,"OK, so you know how this movie will end. A guy and a girl meet each other under weird circumstances, fall in love and meet years later because they are meant for each other. Like so often.but it's not bad at all, the clues are very funny and even though it's too absurd it is still funny. A nice 'romantic comedy'.There are some classic moments that couples must have done before or after seeing this movie. Like connecting the dots (freckles) on a girl's arm... sigh... do soulmates really exist?"
5,Serendipity DVD,What a great movie. Really wonderful music and a nice message. A perfect movie to watch on a first date or with one of your girl friends! A real feel good movie! It really makes you want to go to New York and have some fun!
4,"Classic, Simple, and Romantic",After dating my current girlfriend for several weeks we reminisced about how serendipitous our relationship turned out to be. She continued by explaining the plot to the movie Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale - I had know idea what she was talking about so I just had to check it out myself. Immediately thereafter I logged onto Amazon and purchased the movie. Great movie for a romantic night in.
4,An enjoyable film,"I bought this movie recently on a whim, as a friend told me I would probably like it. I am also a big fan of Kate Beckinsale(I'm a guy and what guy isn't LOL). Anyways, I won't delve too much into the movie as this is the blu ray review of this film.Basically, if you are a hopeless romantic you will like this film. The music is great throughout the movie.The blu ray transfer is HD is great so the fillm looks and sounds excellent. There are a decent amount of special features that make this a bargain at $9.99.Now I need to find a Sarah Thomas and her number :)"
5,Absolute Favorite Movie,I was so excited to finally find this movie on blu-ray and was surprised to find it at such a reasonable price. My FAVORITE MOVIE!!
4,Not Too Bad of a Sappy Romance: 3 1/2 Stars,"This movie is pretty much a typical Hollywood forumla romance flick. However, there are a few differences. First, there's John Cusack, a character actor/leading man whose mere presence tends to make even the most meaningless drivel watchable. Thankfully, SERENDIPITY is not a bad movie and Cusack's presence just makes it a little better. What really captured my attention in the film was the question of fate and destiny. Is there a grand scheme to life? The question is answered with a verifying yes, but not after forcing the viewer to analyze the question. Overall, not too bad of a movie. It has a happy ending and is worth viewing to see Cusack and Kate Beckinsale."
2,too predictable,"I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale, but I'm really disappointed when I watched her in this movie. She's not that bad, but the movie itself is bad. The plot is boring and too predictable. Of course this is only a movie, but I've watched other movies and though something called fate or luck seem to take place, they don't seem half as unnatural as the one in this movie. It seem that the storyline made as if the two main characters were somehow brought together by the director, or the writer, rather than by fate itself. I don't know if this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it funny at all. Also, the fact that they both had lovers already at the time made it kinda lame. I mean, would you like your boyfriend/girlfriend to go out shopping one day and fell for a beautiful stranger? Well, just my two cents.."
2,"Extremely Predictible, almost Annoying","I found it almost annoying that the premise of a movie would be that two people come together with great promise but the woman gets this feather headed idea to leave their whole future up to fate. She is writing her name and address in a book she is going to sell to a New York City used books store so he can find her if the book ever finds its way into his hands. His name is on currency that, if fate speaks, will find its way into her hands. I like John Cusack a lot and Kate Beckinsale is a very good ingenue type. However, this is very... and I recommend watching it only if you've run out of other things to put on your player. I can't believe that some people are actually comparing this to Grant and Kerr in the classic ""An Affair to Remember."" I wish."
2,This movie is dangerous,"This movie spreads all the wrong ideas about love. When the Kate Beckindale character won't give the John Cusack character her phone number or name, unless they have a sign from ""fate"", I was hoping he would throw up his hands in digust and decide to go be in a better movie. Alas. The idea the the female lead's behavior is forgivable or even acceptable is just plain wrong. This sort of belief in ""fate"" is what leads some people to disregard real happiness right in front of them for some distant ideal which may never materialize. This movie has plenty of other problams as well, including the presence of Molly Shannon, who while funny, just doesn't fit in to the movie's tone. This movie is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy."
2,A so-so love story .,"John Cusack has definetley been better in alot of love films. What ever happened to High Fidelity or Better off Dead , or evenGrosse Point Blank. A totally unrealistic and sappy love story with an ending that wraps up nothing and it is only like 93 minutes long! I expected something more funny and enjoyable. Starring: John Cusack , Kate Beckinsale , Molly Shannon , Jermey Piven , John Corbett , Bridget Moynahan and Eugene Levy.-..."
2,Great idea - terrible script and screenplay,"Some bad reviews from me here for the script and the editor - too long, too much, and not enough good music. I'm not going to say more except the ""idea"" is better than this mess and is one of the few I think should be redone."
5,A Completely Enchanting Romantic Comedy,"I've watched a lot of movies billed as Romantic Comedy over the years,but found relatively few of them to be romantic and even fewer to be funny. ""Serendipity"" is one of the exceptions, succeeding very well as a comedy and succeeding with all the brilliance of the sun as a beautiful, sensuous, fairy-tale romance. A chance meeting, enchatment at first sight, a chance on fate, a twist of bad luck followed by love's refusal to drift off into the sunset despite all odds and all rationality add up to a spellbinding movie that, all by itself, makes up for every single romantic comedy that's tried to be this good and fell far short. Starring the beautiful Kate Beckinsale (in probably the best performance of her accomplished career) and John Cusack, with a small but brilliant role played to perfection by Eugene Levy."
3,Mislabeled DVD Package,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the excellent performances and would have given it a 5* rating, the DVD package is completely misleading. It lists a number of bonus features that are not available on the disk (at least the one I have). There is no director's comments available for the deleted scenes; there is no ""On Set"" feature; no director's notes and no storyboards.I do not understand why the packaging lists these features and then they are unavailable. One of the reasons I got the DVD was for these non-existant features. A real disappointemnt!"
3,It Was Fate!,"This is a backdoor Christmas movie where everyone lives happily ever after, I guess. My wife saw this on TV and wanted it. I watched it with her. John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale are both attractive and develop good chemistry with their sidekicks but there are too few scenes of their one night romance to validate the premise of the movie, a compulsive belief that they had met THE PERSON but let them slip away.Hey, my wife liked it - I am her hero for buying it; I hope! She held my hand. I felt pretty good about that! GUYS!!! Do yourself a favor if your need a chick flick for your library of movies, this ain't bad."
1,COULD HAVE BEEN A WINNER,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I THOUGHT KATE BECKINSALE WAS SO GOOD IN EMMA AND MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. THIS MOVIE WAS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. THE STORY WAS TOTALLY CONTRIVED. THEY CRINKLE THEIR NOSES AND SAY CUTE THINGS TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THEY MEET AND SEVEN YEARS LATER THEY CAN'T MARRY THEIR RESPECTIVE NEW LOVES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FORGET WHAT THEY HAD TOGETHER. THEY SHOW THEM JUST MISSING EACH OTHER IN THE SILLIEST SCENES. THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN VERY CLEVER AND THE ONE ""SCENE"" (RATED R OR X) SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY LEFT OUT. THERE ARE MANY WAYS A MOVIE CAN SHOW A PERSON LOVES (OR SEEMS TO) SOMEONE ELSE. IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY"
2,The only good thing was John Cusack,"This movie was soooooo boring and stupid, why would these two people give up such a good thing over superstition? And afterJohn Cusack makes a committment to marry his girlfriend he spoils his wedding just to again run after some girl who was stupid enough to make him run in circles to please her silly fancies. The first time I watched this movie I shut it off even before it had begun, then felt bad and then tried to finish it. Bad Idea. Its an irritating movie about romance gone absolutely bonkers. Don't waste your money even to rent this unless you are a die-hard romance fan.AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG."
2,"Faith,, Hope, Charity Triumphs","The wonderment of the best in all of us is captured in one story, reminding us that everything is possible."
3,Not Excruciating,"While this movie is clearly a chick-flick, it's not completely offensive as compared to other such dross.(I don't know what the deal is with John Cusack, but his movies seem to be big hits with the ladies.)This DVD would make a very good present for your girlfriend or wife, and you won't completely hate it when you are forced to watch it."
3,By the numbers chick flick,"Yeah, I used that phrase, and more women use that than men, I'm sure. Serendipity, for all its considerable charm (many props to the casting director), belongs in the same boat as any Meg Ryan film, any Sandra Bullock film, or anything written by Nora Ephron, etc.In other words, when you wanna stun 'em with your sensitivity, guys, you rent this.It's got Eugene Levy (never better), Jeremy Piven, and Molly Shannon as its secondary characters, but with all due respect to John Cusack and Kate Beckinsdale (who are adequate), the main characters aren't the main attraction. Something of a problem when we're asked to care specifically about the main couple of the piece!It's routine romance fare; nothing strikingly original, and an ending that's way too quick for the amount of time you have to put into the whole film, but you won't go wrong by it."
4,Seredipilicous,"Serendipity is a light, romantic comedy that is hard to resist. It stars the always solid John Cusack and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale. The chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal and really makes the movie what it is.The two character's struggle to find each other is very entertaining to watch, if not predictable. But, what's wrong with a movie being predictable, yet fun to watch? Nothing at all.The movie is extremely funny in certain parts, but comedy is not the main attraction. Serendipity has a good meaning that will either put people off or engross them. You either have to believe in fate or not to like this movie. And even if you don't, it's still enjoyable to watch.Serendipity is a cute movie that should be mandatory for first date couples to watch. Even the men will enjoy this one. 4 Stars"
4,A sweet love story,My husband and I saw this movie on cable and I loved it so much he gave it to me for our anniversary. It is a story about two people that come together in a chance meeting and can not get the other out of their mind. It is about fate and love and where one should be and with whom.
5,"Romance, Destiny, and Some Humor","If you love romantic comedies, you will love this. In this movie, two people meet in a new york department store, have a wonderful time, and then leave it to fate to have them meet again. A few years later, they are both about to get married to different people and go on last minute searches to find each other and get closure before tying the not. They often cross paths and just barely miss each other, which can be pretty funny, and jonathan's (john cusac's) best man is hilarious. A must see."
3,Fun but thin,"Enough fun and romance for me to enjoy seeing it once. But the plot is a both predictable and far-fetched. It's OK, but there are other movies that are both more fun and more romantic."
3,Nice romantic comedy,"Nothing really special about this movie... just a nice, fluffy, romantic comedy. Good for a rental once with the significant other. If you are a big believer in fate this movie will have a bigger impact on you."
2,Romantic saps take notice...highly improbable chick flick,"This movie is, well, how can I say this...dumb! Yea, that's it. This movie is so far fetched, I have seen more plausible alien invasion movies than this!! I mean, c'mon, what kind of guy would spend his last hours of freedom searching for a girl who he only spent a couple hours with? And fly across the country in search of her the night before his wedding? What!???? Talk about unrealistic! And to think that someone as hot as Kate Beckinsale would still be on the market after 3 years is highly unlikely. Though romantic saps will love this movie, it is far too improbable and out of reach for my tastes. This movie is so unlikely, I can't even classify it as a fairy tale. Don't tempt ""fate"", stay away from this movie!! Rent or buy something more realistic, like Black Hawk Down."
1,Proof that great actors can't save lousy writing,"It's like a college freshman's attempt at a Tracy/Hepburn film. Can one hang an entire tale on a used-to-be-trendy restaurant? Can one hope to add artistic/intellectual credibility by tossing in a Gabriel Garcia Marquez book as a plot device? One can certainly try, and someone did, but the results are beyond disappointing.John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Piven, and Eugene Freakin' Levy?!? Was this movie a trade-off for other projects they wanted to do? All four are accomplished, smart, talented actors but this flick was a D - O - G dog. I don't expect much depth out of a romantic comedy but it isn't much fun when you can not only predict what's going to happen, but you can actually predict what the actors are going to say minutes before they say it.Without John Cusack attached to it, I doubt this beast would pass muster as a Lifetime Television Movie."
1,This movie made me mad!,"I watched this movie with my fiance and was quite disturbed. It was as though we were supposed to be happy that these two people were CHEATING on their fiances.This is an example of bad acting, bad writing, bad premise, bad everything."
2,Nothing Special,"It's not that it was a bad movie. It just wasn't that good! If you've seen the preview u know the movie. You know the beginning and u know the end the only thing the movie itself tells you is the middle of the story and that's the boring stuff anyways.The only thing I liked about this movie was the actors in it, and some of their previous work."
3,Cusack coasts through another one,"At least it was better than his last effort, America's Sweethearts, which was truly awful. He's certainly a reliable actor for any producer or director since he basically plays the same character in every one of his films. If that doesn't bother you and you enjoyed his other films, you'll probably enjoy this one too. It's a decent date flick, but not one that you'd consider watching again such as When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle."
2,Disappointing Romantic Comedy,"I was highly disappointed by this sappy romantic comedy. My main problem with it is that it's predictable and quite unrealistic. I know, I know... you're saying ""but that's the point!"", but c'mon, there needs to be a drop of reality in there somewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie to see with a loved one, this may just fit the bill. One other problem I had with this was again, dealing with reality. The NYT's office is located on W 43rd St, not 42nd St, and in some points, it was clear that it was being filmed in Toronto, and not NYC."
3,A silly movie about silly people,"The thing about fate is: it can be cruel--which is how I sum up my experience in watching this movie. John Cusack again plays John Cusack about a man who bumps into a beautiful woman doing the Christmas shopping days and ends up spending the next--what a few hours being entertained by the woman. But neither actually fully introduces themselves.??? So after their brief time together and the woman actually/finally writes her name on a piece a paper and balances it in between her fingers and a truck blows it away, then it's FATE, telling her to run. No, this isn't the man for you. ??? So lets run some more silly test that doesn't work out and then next thing we know it's years later and the couple are still plagued with what could have been. So another cat and mouse game ensues when each rushes to find each other once again--this time before John Cusack marries another woman. (a man with class) Basically, it's silly...but mildly entertaining."
4,ROMANTIC MASTERPIECE!,"I will keep this brief. If you like John Cusack films, you will love this movie. Very entertaining and extremely romantic. It really makes you feel lucky to have found your own ""soulmate"". I HIGHLY reccomend this film to all you romantics out there. Watch it with your girl..."
4,Better than most romantic movies,"Guys-this is a pretty safe movie to get for a date with your wife.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale play the roles of Jonathan and Sarah exceptionally well. The story line lacks credibility in several places, but it's unique and packs some good surprises.The basic paradigm of this movie rests on the fallacies of new age world views, and the movie takes several swipes at those very paradigms...but then goes on to prove it's true. So as a Christian, I would point out that this is only entertainment...and that people should not put their lives into the hands of the mystery of fate (as Serendipity teaches by inference).Now that I've said that....let me say that we probably will watch this movie again. It gives you a good feeling and has a great ending. Both actors are enchanting and the whole experience is a positive one."
1,Defective. Does not work,The DVD does not work. The other two dvd's I purchase worked fine. I want a refund or a new dvd that works.
4,Serendipity...Do You Believe in Fate?,"I really enjoyed the film ""Serendipity""! This film revolves around two people who meet by chance and instantly feel a connection. Wanting to believe that what they feel is fate, they decide to embark on an exercise to decide if they're really meant for each other involving a book, a name, and a phone number.John Cusack plays the perfect romanctic male lead in this film and Kate Beckinsale does a good job as the female lead. You immediately feel the emotions of both characters as they try to come back to one another.I would definitely recommend this film to all those who love a good romantic comedy! This film really makes you believe that you can find true love anywhere, and that everyone has their own perfect person out there for them, no matter what other people or circumstances may come in their way."
4,a fortunate meeting twice,"Adorable & funny romantic movie. A movie to watch with your guy/lady......just the two of you. The movie seems to go by so fast because there's always something good happening in most scenes. Based in the past 20 years, this movie would be in my top 10 Funny Romantic Comedy List. What a great friend Molly Shannon (former cast in SNL) is in this movie. As for not giving all 5 stars rating: dvd movies should be available in Full Screen as well. ...or even better: every dvd movie comes in both full and widescreen (just to make everyone happy). That's probably the only neg. thing I can say about the DVD feature, but the actual movie is great!"
5,John Cusack delivers again!,"You HAVE to be fan of John Cusack to appreciate this movie. He gives yet another enjoyable performance being teamed up again with Jeremy Piven. Their comedic timing and interaction are classic, and the best parts of this movie.If you did not enjoy movies like Gross Pointe Blank, Say Anything, or High Fidelity, you probably won't care much for this one. But if you LOVE watching John Cusack at his best, here it is!"
1,what was that?,I think they made an error in the name of the movie it should have been called Stupidity not Serendipity. I'm so glad it was my friends money which was wasted on renting this poor excuse for a movie and not my own - it completely sucked. Unless you are into EXTREMELY cheesy and pathetic movies do not buy this it is a time waster.
1,Skip it!,"This movie was awful, don't waste your time! It looks cute and sounds like a cute idea, but it just drags on and is not funny."
3,"Reduced stars for aspect ratio, NOT the movie itself.","I'll leave the review of the movie to others, but I forgot this was a Lionsgate release and they did what they usually do - they very slightly zoom into the image, resulting in a full screen 16:9 (1.78:1) aspect ratio for what was in theaters a 1.85:1 release.While for most this will be no big deal, if you're looking carefully you CAN see a difference between this and the older letterboxed DVD.A nit to be sure, but not one that needs to be there, especially when the 2002 Miramax release got it right.Serendipity (2002 DVD)"
4,A Guy's Opinion.,"John Cusack is a great actor. When you're good...you're good.He just nails this. It's a romantic comedy, sure. But not at all cheesey. It's really allot of fun.And Kate Beckinsale is his love interest?? Are you kidding me???She's a 11 on a scale of 1-10. And funny enough, does a fine job of losing her british accent for this american role.Guys...I say ""Do it.""You'll laugh, she'll cry, it'll be good.Trust Me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Not a ""chick flick""","This is one of the better romantic comedies I have seen in a while -and I'm not just saying that 'cause I have a thing for John Cusack.John Cusack (Jonathan) meets Kate Beckinsale (Sara) in a department store while Christmas shopping. They spend the night getting to know each other and even though both are involved in other relationships, are very drawn to each other.But, Sara decides that they must leave it all up to fate. She writes her name and phone number in a book and sells it to a used bookstore for him to be able to find. And he writes his name and phone number on a $5 bill that he hopes will find it's way back into her hands someday.Years later, they are both days away from getting married to other people and are haunted by the question of what could have been.This was a funny and entertaining movie. John Cusack is adorable as always!!! And Jeremy Piven (who plays Jonathan's best friend) is hysterical!Definitely worth watching!"
2,Okay Read,"This book started out good but very quickly it became depressing and sappy. I had to make myself finish reading, I would have liked Ceylon better if she had a backbone. The love connection seemed forced.... I got tired of reading the sappy ""confessions"" of love."
4,Ceylon & Martin!!!,"I really enjoyed the story of Ceylon and Martin. Martin came off as being a loner and a little mean in the previous two books. This time it was him who came to the resue when Ceylon needed it the most. I was happy that their flirting in the other books became a full blown love affair in this story. Great read, but my only complaint is.... how many time do you really need to use the word ""fragrant""? LOL. THANKS FOR THE GREAT STORY MS. SCHUSTER!!!"
2,Somewhat BORING,This story did not keep my interest and I had to force myself to finish this book. I hope the other books in this series are more interesting and romantic.
2,Expected More,I think there was so much here that could have been developed upon. The main characters were well defined however I found the story to be rushed and weak. Through out the whole book I just kept expecting more. The story line was a bit predictable.
5,Love,This is the frist book i have read by this arthur. I wish i would have read the books in order... I love this book from the start to the end. Lets just say looks are in the eye of the person looking at it. Ceylon is a fine example that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Lets just say the Barbara was as #####. This is a must reaed.
4,"Eclectic, enigmatic, experimental, and most enjoyable","Last year I bought Steve's ""Tangled Strings"" and was pleasantly surprised by its depth and complexity. I listen to it regularly. His latest is similar enough to ""Tangled"" that if you like it, you will be happy you bought this one as well, but different enough to keep anyone from getting complacent. To me, a couple of songs stand out. ""Friction"" is odd but interesting, and Steve's basso croaking paired with Barbara's calm, ""normal"" vocals provide an effective counterpoint. I like the syncopation in ""The Mistake"" as well. ""Don't Throw it Away"" will probably become one of my favorites. The strange, whining tone woven into ""Underwater"" confuses me a bit, but I am very happy I bought this CD, and hope you'll enjoy it as I do."
5,Teriffic!,"I loved this book! It was so captivating, I couldn't wait to turn to the next page, yet dreaded it at the same time as it would mean I'd finish it sooner and there wouldn't be any more to read! A must read, in my opinion, for any Sherlock Fan! Great work Autumn! Can't wait for the next book!"
2,Boring fluff fanfiction,"I read this while it was still on [...] and that says a lot about this book. It's a self-indulgent, over glorified fanfiction. It's a dull, slow beginning, unimaginative plot with a one dimensional main character, and bad characterization of Sherlock Holmes."
1,this movie takes D**K. Regularly.,I invited a number of friends to see this movie with me on my computer. They are no longer my friends. Case proven.
4,C'est vrai,"I took French for a total of 5 years but have not really studied it in years. This book is a fairly thorough remedial and is aiding me as I prepare to resume courses and really pick up the language in full this time. I especially appreciate the modernity of the examples, dialogues and text. Also, the glossary/dictionary in back is helpful, as are the exercises. If you have had even a little French before, or are currently in a class and want to supplement it, I'd recommend this book. Bon chance!"
3,Nothing special,"The layout of this book really didn't work for me. I've taken spanish at school for many years, and I appreciate the way the classes seem to usually be laid out: a theme is introduced with a lot of relevant vocabulary, a lot of review, exercises, and reinforcement with the vocabulary, and an element of grammar introduced and practiced. French Without the Fuss seems to just take it's own path, teaching what it feels when it feels like it. Yes, there are sections of related vocab introduced, but not much of it at a time. The exercises aren't in depth and there aren't too many of them, leaving me wanting more practice or moving on without a grasp on everything I just studied. The book does do a good job with grammar, fully showing irregular verb conjugations, introducing other grammatical concepts one at a time and using them in the dialogs. I guess my major complaint is the lack of excersises for practice and the jumping around feel I get from using it."
4,"Good Sequel, Interesting Universe","The House of Reeds is a good sequel to Wasteland of Flint, both of them setting a style of unusual handling and an unusual universe for SF.The universe is unusual as it's not the typical Campbellian model of American and European style humans as they nobly rule the galaxy -- instead it's the Aztecs and Japanese tip-toeing around in a large and dangerous Galaxy where humans have little power or understanding of the far larger players.The handling is unusual in that the female lead is a fairly low-caste Nordic worker who has again stumbled into something of the larger powers, and now must figure a way to complete her work without a vast disaster.I'm glad there is this sequel and enjoyed the further work in this universe. You should read the first novel to enjoy both more, as characters from the first book are continued and the first book is a smoother intro to the universe than this one, but you can read this one alone."
3,Adequate Space Opera,"An improvement on its predecessor, House of Reeds suffers from Harlan's tendency to construct excessively elaborate plots and use of a large number of relatively shallow characters. He is continuing to flesh out this fairly enjoyable but implausible future history, which continues to be the best aspect of these books."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't get to read the first book in this series. It's possible that would have changed my opinion but I don't believe it would change much.I found it very tough going to read. I could not identify the hero or the villan of the book. All the sympathetic characters ended up getting torn apart and all the bad folks got exactly what they wanted.There were a large number of shallow characters that I could not stay interested in, and in some places had trouble keeping separate.The author should learn foreshadowing, characterization, better editing, and remove all the extraneous detail. There's nothing wrong with his imagination though.I don't recommend this book"
3,good but could be better,"I enjoyed the first novel in Harlan's series about a futuristic Aztec/Japanese space empire very much and waited for this book to come out in paperback with great anticipation. I must confess that while the book is good (adequate pool/beach reading) I am disappointed. The main problem is that the book focuses far to much on battle scenes. The first book dealt more with issues of thought and introspection, and while there were some space battles these did not dominate the book or drag out unnecessarily. In ""House of Reeds"" they do. The problem being that, Harlan's descriptions of battles gets repetitous. There are only so many ways to describe an explosion, or a tank or a gun. Following every bullet is unnecessary. I was really very saddened in a way because I was hoping for more from these books but I am afraid that Mr. Harlan is following the example of his first series which I felt degenerated considerabley after the first book."
2,I'm a little sheepish,"I really didn't expect this book to be mil-SF, since the first one really wasn't. When the ""master sergeant"" who happens to be an Imperial Eagle Knight (oddly enough, most of the military characters have what I assume are made-up Aztec or Japanese ranks, even the Scots are ""Skawtzmen"" or something similar, but he's a master sergeant) threw a grenade and it exploded twice, I quit really caring.It's funny, I can't really explain why some books filled with battles and military action are gripping and some are groaners, but I can say for sure this guy is no C. S. Forester. If you're a mil-SF type, you might like it, but otherwise I'd suggest the first in the series."
4,Pre-cholesterol.,"As I read this book, and browsed through the recipes, I remembered when I happily consumed many of these delious edibles (as well as tactfully avoided the equally noxious ones) in blissful ignorance. I still consume many of these traditional Lutheran dishes at church functions, now usually held in the Lutheran School building. Today, though, I am required to feel guilty about consuming them, can very nearly HEAR them clogging arteries. That basement holds many fond memories of more innocent times!"
2,Pretty sloppy,"As someone who has enjoyed many a pot-luck in the basement of a Lutheran church, I was pretty excited to get my hands on a copy of this. What a disappointment. This book is mostly recipes, which unfortunately don't come with very detailed instructions. As far as the jokes and (not terribly) funny stories, they are rife with spelling errors, confusing paragraphs ( I honestly had trouble telling if Lutherans eat fruitcake or not) and other indications that this book needed some serious editing. Finally, by ""Lutheran"" the authors apparently mean ""Scandinavian"" as there isn't much mention of German-Americans in the book. The best part of this book is the collection of vintage photographs, which don't have any captions."
5,Make This The One Book You Start With,"As an amateur backyard builder attempting to design and build an airplane, I actually got much more out of ""Simplified Aircraft Design For Homebuilders"" than any of the other aircraft design books, including some extremely expensive volumes that are regularly advertised.This book is well-written, covering the subject of aircraft design on a basic level that is easily grasped by the average homebuilder/non engineer. It's also gleefully sprinkled with a dash of humor, much like a ""design book for Dummies"". Dan Raymer goes to great lengths to include the finer details of aircraft design that are so illusive and so very time-consuming and difficult for the amateur to research. This book will actually save you months of frustration and research. It's all here in this one little book."
4,Good introduction to small airplane design.,"You will need math, make no mistake about that. You'll also need to have access to an Excel or OpenOffice spread sheet program. This book will give you an appreciation of the complexity and trade offs of small airplane design. This book covers the aero aspect of airplane design. You'll need lots more mechanical engineering knowledge to actually design the airplane hardware. Mechanical engineering is not covered by this book."
4,A book that has not lost its relevance,"I write this review having read this book in the early 80's, and now trying to find it again to re-read. Although I only read it once, its premise has revisited me over and over again - the fact that our state, and yes, our national borders in North America are imaginary. I can say that from personal experience, what Joel Garreau wrote about the similarities of people and values within regions is not 100% accurate, but extremely close. Having come from Toronto and moving to suburban Detroit, I less culture shock had I made a similar move to Miami, or even Seattle or Vancouver. Places like Chicago and New York are far more familiar to me, being part of the ""Foundry"", as Garreau calls the north-central US and southern Ontario. I'm sure that many a sociologist may not agree with his conclusions, but they are observations made with the keen eye of a journalist. They are not bad ones, at that."
5,Headhunter Use of Nine Nations,"I bought this book when it came out in 1982. I have bought four of them over the years because my ""friends"" kept stealing or borrowing them. I used Garreau's theorems in deciding which candidates stood the best possibility of adjusting to relocation in my executive recruiting business in the days before the Internet. The most successful, most interchangeable relocation: Pittsburgh-Baltimore, Baltimore -Pittsburgh. The most surprising but relevant detail: Fort Worth is a ""Western"" city and Dallas is a ""Southern"" one. He was the first writer of a published book who named what I had lived in Miami...South Florida is part of the Caribbean and South America. This was a book ahead of its time and NEVER should have gone to Remainders.This was one of the most imfluential books of my career. Joel Garreau had vision thirty years ago that stood the test of time.Sibyl Masquelier[...]Cape Elizabeth, ME"
3,intriguing,"This is almost a travel book, more than anything else. Garreau's Nine Nations are probably not intended to be political predictions about the near future. Not rigorously researched in an academic manner, it is a bunch of Studs Terkel-type interviews mixed with the ideas about a place that people observe during widespread travels and a fair bunch of statistics (without footnotes).Written in the depths of the energy crisis of the 1970s and Carter's Moral Equivalent of War, it does seem a bit obsessed with energy at first. But after the introduction and the New England chapter, it picks up more balance, although, as with any reporting, one can never pin down the author to a particular viewpoint.As a look at the arbitrary and somewhat meaningless nature of national and state/province borders; every continent ought to be looked at in this way! If you can only live and explore one part of it, 'The Nine Nations of North America' has plenty to say about the rest."
4,great cultural overview to give friends in Europe/Asia etc,"He discusses 9 different regions of America, with a map showing the boundaries. He calls them New England, The Foundry, Dixie, The Islands (of Caribbean/Florida), MexAmerica, Breadbasket (midwest), Ecotopia (west coast), Empty Quarter, and Quebec. He shows how each has its own distinctive culture and economic climate. Published in 1981, but still rather a good read."
4,"Very interesting, but could stand an update","Messrs. Garreau are pretty spot-on in their analyses of the situation, I'd say. Unfortunately, as the most common criticism goes, their information is now quite out of date. I don't know how much effect a ... review might have, but is it too much to ask for the authors to re-research, and release an updated version?"
5,There are two kinds of poets,"There are two kinds of poets. One is called a ""free-verse"" poet and does not concern themself with rhyme, nor do they want to be coarsened by lying on a wet blanket. ""Rhymed verse"" poets are more careful and orderly but they lose something, and they never write poems about huge towers. The Garreau book is well written."
5,Excellent!,"This book has been around since before I was born. One of my first memories is reading this book on a city bus with my grandpa. When I began my first teaching job, I went on a quest to find this book. I could only remember what the cover looked like. I finally found it.The book is divided up into several categories. There are poems about seasons, nonsense poems, etc. There are well known children's poets and lesser known children's poets. All the poems are good, but I must warn you that some of the poems would be considered mildly politically incorrect by some. The best part is that there are so many poems! This is one of the best ways you can spend about $10 if you have kids."
3,Children's Poetry,"I purchased this book to use with my primary students. It contains an assortment of children's poetry that can be used for introducing a unit, enhance a lesson, or promote reading fluency. You can be sure you will be able to find every subject area covered in this poetry book. The poems were selected by Jack Palansky a premiere author of children's poetry. Good book to add to your teacher resource library--if you can get it at a discount"
3,The Random House,I loved this book of poetry. If you are a teacher of have a young child this book is a must have.
3,Just so so..,Not as exciting or holding interest as the 20th Century Anthology by the same author...
2,"this is for ""children"" 9 and older?","The collection doesn't sound too bad, but won;t a self-respecting 9 year old (or older) person reject this book simply on the basis of the illustrations (you klnow, the ones with the ""round faced happy children"") and the title of the book? I know when I was nine I avoided books with ""children's"" in their title."
3,"Large range, small style.","Printed in 1992, this thick tome (207 pages long) contains a huge variety of quilt patterns, traditional and funky. Unfortunately like most interior decoration or themed books from that still 80's influenced era, it has not dated well.Interesting for reference without containing too much inspirational material, the book includes 20 quilt projects illustrated with high detail and good instructions.It also photographs myriad pages of quilts separated into different themed sections - ""amish"" ""Log Cabin"" ""Caring for Quilts"" & many more subcategories.Whilst being an excellent compendium of quilts of the past, photographing them in such dated settings detracts from the charm of the quilts themselves.Understandably this book was created from a collection of ""Country Living"" photographic shoots therefore the approach is a reasonable one.Not recommended as anything more than a library borrow, unless purchaseable for under $5.kotori"
2,Not as described....,This item was sold as a hardcover book. Instead it has extremely flimsy paper covers.
4,Nam,"This is the greatest book I have ever read. It is the worst book that I have ever read. Let me explain. The journey is tough to read, but it shows how dedicated the boys were, and they all were just boys. How the leaders turn red blooded Americans into something that they never wanted to be. It shows how the leaders were just looking out for their future and didn't care about the soldiers. Those that marched in this country should be ashamed at the way they treated the soldiers, because they were all hero's.We should all have a parade for these boys and apologize for the American behavior.Great book!"
4,used book,Book cover was a Little more worn looking than expected but generally in good condition. Book came in a timely manner.
4,Such a Voice!,"Undeniably, Mahalia Jackson had a strong, clear, vibrant, emotional, BEAUTIFUL voice! While I liked volume 1 of this set a little better (due to the selections), I am also glad to have this set in my collection."
5,Wonderful Tales Of The Frontier,"THE HANGING TREE is a wonderful collection of frontier tales by a woman who has gotten unfairly short shrift as a very fine American writer. Dorothy Johnson's stories, set mostly in her native Montana, dealt with men and women, frontier riff-raff, lawmen, and Indians. These are no stereotypical westerns, they are stories of the human condition that happen to take place on the frontier. The title story in this collection, THE HANGING TREE, is the best, I think. A haunting tale of an ill-fated frontier doctor -- Joe Frail -- it works as a pure western, as a moving love story, and as a psychological character study. It was the basis for Gary Cooper's last western, one of the finest westerns ever made, the masterful THE HANGING TREE."
2,Should have fab up something,These were too much for what they were. I shoulds have built something out of scrap steel. They went together easy.
2,The card crashed on my vacation,"I bought this card because of its capacity and it crashed on me during my vacation. I got a replacement card when I returned home. Luckily there was not a complete failure and I only lost a couple of pictures.I have a Viking Card, which is really good."
4,AMERICAN ROSE ANNUAL 1957,"The American Rose Society began publishing annuals in 1924, and each of them is a treasure collection of articles written by famous rosarians from the US and abroad. The 1957 version offers the writings of such glories as Roy E. Shepherd (author of the classic HISTORY OF THE ROSE, 1954), and Wilhelm Kordes (of the Kordes German nursery that has produced some of the world's greatest roses like 'ICEBERG' and 'WESTERLAND'). The 1957 edition also offers advice to rose growers in the American Desert, the Southwest, Minnesota and Hawaii. Shepherd's article alone makes this book a great purchase."
3,Not quite as good as Fairy of the Woods,"This is a nice cd, soothing and pleasant. But I think it lacks the etheral quality present in Fairy of the Woods. It would have been much better without the singing."
5,THE ONE CD TO TAKE TO THE DESERT ISLAND,"I've never heard anything quite like Singh Kaur (Lorellei) in this CD, and unfortunately probably never will, as she recently passed away. When I heard abour her death, I immediately ordered another tape and CD in case something happened to my original. This is the CD I would request on my death bed, or would choose for the proverbial ""one piece of music"" I would choose if I were marooned on a desert island. Singh Kaur alone is wonderful (but scarce), and Gary Stadler is okay, but together they are magical."
5,my favorite story is a great movie,"Chekhov's THE DUEL, an astounding novella that will change your mind about what a short work of fiction can do, has been faithfully, thoughtfully, affectionately, and intelligently transformed into a movie that has all the wild energy and deep psychological pathos of the original work. Don't miss it. Everything about it is wonderful, the actors, the direction, the setting (shot in Croatia which is stunningly beautiful), and the script. Can't recommend highly enough."
1,Wouldn't Buy Again,"I read the reviews for the same case for other devices, even bought the same case for my wife's Galaxy SII......everything looked good, however the fit for my AT&T Samsung Note didn't work out. The case is a little too big so that it slips off, it's difficult to depress the volume rocker, and the hole for the micro-usb port is blocked by the case so it's very difficult to charge your device while the case is on. I would not suggest buying this case, it was definitely a waste of my money."
2,Too Biased,"I understand that the book is written by the people at the Miami Herald, but this book is far to biased. The Marlins are made to look like superhumans, and the Yankees like complete losers. I am a Yankees fan, but I do have an appreciation for the Marlins. I just can't believe that things like Ruben Sierra's triple or Alfonso Soriano's home run were just minimized and completly overshadowed by things like Alex Gonzales's home run in game 4."
2,"a garage sale, dig through the crap to find the good stuff","This text was required for a course in Mass Media and Culture. I have read many books on this very topic and find that Twitchell has some good things to offer to the discussion. However, it is horribly written. The writing is reminiscent of a college sophmore's english term paper. The chapters are long and grossly unorganized. He repeats his points, is unjudicious in the selection of his quotes, and includes superflous examples from the media with little to no connection. In short, this is an ideal example of how NOT to write."
2,"The ""Trashing of Taste"" alright...","Twitchell, although he does bring an interesting point of view to the world of media theory, ""trashes"" his own book in a brain fart whereby he endlessly spews numbers, figures, and statistical information to the reader at an inconceivable rate. If you're looking for stats as opposed to critical analyse - this book's for you."
5,Don't Miss the Boat to Sea Never Dry,"Do you want to take a journey in front of your stereo? Then catch this boat and have a most enjoyable trip. Stephen Jay presents an absolutely fantastic CD full of African influences and funk (as well as a melodic adaptation of a traditional Turkish song). He offers up innumerable instruments, good lyrics and little surprises to tantalize our music-loving souls. I had purchased Tangled Strings, his 1999 release, prior to this CD (which I discovered via his website) and have thoroughly enjoyed this more African flavored CD. Once again, you will find yourself immersed in a swirl of sounds that keep you coming back for more. Add this CD to your collection TODAY!!"
3,beautiful writing but tried my patience,"Much of the writing in 'The Orchard' is beautiful and I enjoyed the exploration of the relationships among the four main characters -- Ettie, Louise, Clara and the author. However, I also agree with 'The Booklist' review. I found the intellectual ruminations self-indulgent and a struggle to get through. The middle essay 'Sight and Solitude' was particularly trying and after reading it, I decided to give the book 15 more minutes of my time before deciding whether to quit. Fortunately the essay 'The Winterbourne' was much more engaging so I stuck with the book. Much is made about the link between the legend of the maiden with the silver hands and the rest of the book -- I'm afraid I didn't really see that link that strongly, and while I enjoyed the legend, it didn't succeed in bringing the whole narrative together for me."
1,Disappoointed in Sesame Street,"I puchased this ""healthy food"" set for my grandson. We had to throw away the apples and strawberries because they had sharp edges and were not strong enough to be played with for a 18 month old. He was left with the muffin, which he soon took apart only to find a sharp point. The cookies were okay along with the glasses, plates and spoons. The banana was questionable because it had the right texture to bite and yet did not seem strong enough. ""Happy, Healthy and Hungry"" appeared to be misleading. My grandson plays with the cookies and the dishes. I trusted the Sesame Street title and this product does not live up to a Sesame Street Product!"
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this toy. Very cheaply made, and definitely not worth the money."
4,Great set!,I got this for my three year old a couple of years back and I still have pieces! They have been played by three kids and washed quite a few times. They can take a beating for a little play set that I thought would only last a few months.
2,Ok,I thought this would be more fun for my 9 month old son but it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. I think it will be more fun for him once he is a little bit older.
2,Grandchilden aren't exactly thrilled,Not a big hit with the grandchildren. The pieces are very small and some are paper. Not worth the money.
2,Very dated,"The book is very dated and the projects are not very interesting or unusual, but with children to think about, many of the patterns will have appeal. Surprisingly there are few books on plywood projects."
3,Informative...,"Because I really have a love for shoes, I wanted to hear what could be spoken about it them. At moments I thought the documentary got out of the lane, but still understood the purpose as to why."
5,Great Dio CD,"This is a great CD featuring many of Dio's hit songs. Also since the price is so low you may also want to consider picking up ""The Very Best of Dio"" which is another greatest hits CD. I believe the CDs only have 4 songs in common, so that leaves plenty of different songs between the two. And the 2nd CD isn't very pricey either.Both are great buys for any Dio fan or fan of Metal."
2,I'm not really sure this works...,"I had run out of the stuff I had been using (Next Level Joint Fluid) so I decided to try this stuff. I used it for about a month and it didn't seem to give the same mobility that the Next Level did. I stopped using it and went back to Next Level and my dog is back in action. This isn't meant to be a blind endorsement of Next Level as all dogs, just like people have different body chemistry's. It took me some time to find a supplement that seems to work with mine. Good luck, and try out a few until you find what works for your best friend."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. The description stated the size of the stickers, and the printed stickers are that size, but the cut around each sticker is smaller, and there is only a small part of the blue stars included in the sticker once they are removed from the sheet. I would not buy these again, and am returning other stickers from the same company."
