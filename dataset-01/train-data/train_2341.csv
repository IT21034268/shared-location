3,Intelligent Dance Music,"3 1/2Electronic house pioneers Orbital successfully meshed their dance-influenced, raver-roots with more experimental, melodically intricate fare to cultivate their most accessible but still interesting work to date. Though lacking the focus of previous masterwork In Sides, Middle of Nowhere balances out Orbital's signature keyboard driven sound with a club-friendly playfulness that takes some of their past hypno-fests and elaborates- subtly with the many more blips and bleeps that accompany these bouncy numbers or loudly with brief but passionate exemplary keyboard work."
2,It's alright......,"The songs aren't as good as I had wished them to be, they're TOO happy....if only they would be something like the OLD Orbital....that would be GREAT. But this new HAPPY crap they put in is AWFUL!! I like the OLD Orbital MUCH MUCH better! PLEASE COME BACK!!"
1,Very poor book.,"I found this book to be *very* poor in content. Most of the techniques can be found in the book ""Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere"" plus a whole lot more. I recommend that you don't waste youre time and money with this book, instead get a good book like AATDS."
1,"""Practical martial arts""? Yeah Right","This book has a whole lot of writing about the writer. This whole book is basically reading and about 12 or 13 pictures. The pictures are quite stupid, basically all the pictures show are either things most people already know or how to get yourself killed when a gun is pointed at your head. This is a pretty terrible book for anything more than just reading. This book sucks. HOO-YAH!!!! Thank all war veterans."
5,One of their best!!,"This has got to be the best cd they ever put out. Some may argue that the yoshiesque cd's are better, but I beg to differ. This is flawless stuff. It's hard edged, yet soothing. It's borderline trance, house, and progressive. It's funky, deep, and soulful. It caters to everyone. This is what Deep Dish USED to sound like. This cd should definetly be the first Deep Dish cd you buy. This is the MOST concise definition of Deep Dish. ENJOY!!"
2,extremely disapointed,"the first cd starts off way too mellow, it starts to pick up the pace with track 3 but then it mellows out again the amber mix of sexual doesnt even have vocals in it the beat is alright but would have been better with vocals.CD2 starts off with an old version of ubik which is horrible, and it really is too housy I expected alot more from the D.C boys but i was left disapointed. I am more into trance so if your into house and mellow trance you will probably enjoy this cd collection a lot more than I did."
5,Wow......,"This album defined my musical listening taste for local groups. I originally bought this album as an import, sadly, my ex swiped it when we broke up. I am now purchasing this album for a second time, a strong testiment for my love of this album. this is well worth the money, anyone who loves Tiesto or Oakey, but likes a bit of a darker edge, try this album on for size and I guaruntee you will love it."
4,Honesty pays off,I hadn't heard the story of Puss-n-Boots since I was a child. I remembered that the cat was cunning but I didn't remember the main idea about the cat's master. The concept that his honesty produced his prosperity is a wonderful lesson for children to learn. Quite naturally I love the whole multicultural theme but most importantly the theme is universal. It pays to tell the truth because honesty is the best policy!
5,Psychological thriller,"Frightening themes of manipulation, obsession, and stalking. Ashley is a typical teenager with a heavy load of responsibility caring for her invalid mother. Her only way of reacting to her constricted life is to become ""Cindy"", leaving her mark on buildings for everyone to see. But someone has found out who ""Cindy"" really is...and is watching her every move. The reader will become quickly engaged in this cat and mouse thriller, and in the end may be thrown by the shift in characters. Readers beware: Trust No One."
3,Tightrope,This was a good book. I liked how the author put a red hearing into it. The theme of the book is to be careful you might fall and true friends wont trick you. THe setting of t he book is in a small city in a strip. The ending could have been alot better.
3,Product not as advertised by Amazon,Be forewarned Amazon is actually selling the older model DT534 3/4 cock traps that include a two year warranty on the product and a one year warranty on the clutch- not the 1 million target/ 10 year warranty advertised on this page. In addition the trap is green and orange; not red. Other than that the product is roughly the same; just don't expect the longevity and warranty of the current Do All 3/4 Doubles.
4,A Pleasure,"A light, warm film forgotten by many but treasured by those in the know. A young Denzel Washington makes a wonderful romantic lead in this culture-bending comedy-drama. His costar, Sarita Chowdhary, is a beautiful, sensitive actress who perfectly complements Washington. The theme of racism never overwhelms the love story at the heart of the movie."
4,Entertaining for all cultures,"The movie presented the timeless story of people from other cultures breaking cultural barriers to find love. Similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie winds up speaking for more than just the cultures presented. Better than the Greek Wedding movie, this presents two sides of the cultural divide, and provides a wider range of emotional challenge. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are outstanding in the leads, and the supporting cast puts in a very strong strong.Without spoiling, the ending of the movie was weak. I was not too disappointed when it finished, but I can't give five stars to a movie when I find myself saying, ""Please don't continue this for 10 more minutes, they are ruining a great movie"""
1,mississippi masala,"Unfortunately, I was sent a standard American copy of the movie which, of course, doesn't function on a european system, despite my adress beeing in Switzerland. So I was kind of disapointed to have a)lost the money b)not been able to watch the movie. One is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible DVD player."
4,Mississippi Masala,"An Indian family is expelled from Uganda when Idi Amin takes power. They move to Mississippi and time passes. The Indian daughter falls in love with a black man, and the respective families have to come to terms with it. This movie touches on the origins of the immigrant status of the South Asians which began when they were expelled from Uganda many years earlier. The resentment towards blacks is a recurring theme in the movie as they settle into their new communities in the deep south. This movie has a bouncy music score that adds flavor to the story and a nice cast weaves everything together in fine style. A good romance movie with great lead actors."
4,Good objective look at the crime,"This is an excellent paperback on the horrible 1991 crime in Austin Texas. My only criticism would be with the publisher. The book is not available in hardback so the photos are grainy, black and white as well as limited to about 16 pages. Also, the final part of the book which covers the trial could have had much more text. I was particularly disappointed that certain aspects of the case, such as the Chandra Morgan testimony, were left dangling. However that is part of this tragedy: lots of loose ends to an emotional story."
5,Mitchell Does It Again!,"I have been a huge fan of Corey Mitchell's ever since I picked up ""Dead and Buried."" After I read the brutal story of Rex Krebs I went on a scavenger hunt for his first book, ""Hollywood Death Scenes."" I loved it just as much. So, I was eagerly anticipating this third release from Mitchell. ""Murdered Innocents"" blew me away! The book is incredibly fast-paced, intense, and flows seamlessly. I feel in love with these four girls who I had never heard of and felt my heart rip apart as the truth about their murders was exposed. Mitchell's crisp writing left me breathless as I stayed up all night to finish this book. I could go on all about how good this book is -- instead, I'll just recommend that you rush out immediately and buy ""Murdered Innocents."" (Or buy it here right now). Corey Mitchell, once again, raises the bar for true crime writers!!"
5,Amazing! Fascinating!,"This is an amazing story, shocking, fascinating, eerie, intriguing! Corey Mitchell does an awesome job at telling this story about what really happened to those four girls and what happened afterwards. I remember visiting Austin Texas a few months after this happened. I had no idea that the investigations and trials went on for so many years. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its very easy to read and once you pick it up you'll have a hard time putting it down. You will find yourself wrapped up in this real life story. I cannot wait to read his other works."
1,Disappointing,"This is a poorly written and very poorly developed narrative about a horrifying case. Mitchell left out (perhaps didn't have access to?) a lot of information that I think was crucial--such as why the police focused on these suspects, what convinced the parents of the murdered girls that they were guilty, and what if any forensic evidence the police did/do have. Too much of the book was wasted on court transcripts that didn't seem particularly interesting or relevant. I appreciate Mitchell's stated desire to let readers make up their own minds about the suspects' guilt, but there simply is not enough information here for that to be possible. For anyone interested in a thoughtful, well-written and -researched account of justice gone awry, I highly recommend Mara Leveritt'sDevil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three."
1,Emerald-Another Local,"I desperately wanted this to be the definitive view on the Yogurt Shop Murders, but was disappointed. I wanted to come away feeling strongly for the convicted's guilt or innocence. A large portion of the middle of the book is taken up with chapters on other crimes being committed in Austin. Why? There was no mention of DNA evidence (was there any? any fingerprints on doors? Why was semen mentioned from a boyfriend, but nothing about any perpetrators?) All you have is the confessions which appear to be coerced.As the parent of a child who worked in a competing yogurt shop at the time of the crime, and who had a child who was friends with a sibling of one of the original accused, it didn't really answer most of my questions. I really wanted to be assured the right people were convicted. Very frustrating. Too many unanswered questions."
1,What a bummer!,I am also a fan of Becky Kelly and have bought the calendars in the past with the beautiful ribbons. I was disappointed when I got this year's calendar. It didn't have any ribbon to tie and there were very noticeable glue spots that had stained not only the pictures themselves but the each of month pages as well.
5,Really good flick,"This movie, based on a true story is interesting and Ernest Dickerson's direction is superb - I like the 'shaky' camera effects. David Krumholtz is awesome as Benny Silman! He starts out as a naive freshman, moving across the country to go to college, but the freedoms get the best of him. He starts gambling, then works for a bookie, then goes out on his own. He ends up hooking up with a b-baller to assure the house wins everytime, but the wrong people find out about his scheme and it gets complicated.The subplot with Callie is cute, especially when she mocks him. This movie is great, even after repeated viewings."
5,Like Sportsbetting? You will like this movie!,If you like sports betting or are into gambling you will enjoy this movie. I like the fact it's based on a true story. No this isn't a major blockbuster but if you are into any kind of gambling I think you will have a high appreciation for this movie. Going from rags to riches in a very short period of time only to come crashing back down. Just shows how fast you can get caught up in something and how greedy people really are. After watching this it really makes you think how much point shaving in college games actually is going on. This is a must have dvd for all the gamblers out there!
2,A good idea that doesn't work,"Different than other buyers I have not had the sticking problem in using this grill/griddle combo. However, the instructions state that ONLY very low to medium heat may be used. Aside from that, the surface is NOT to be exposed to open flame. Pray tell, if it is supposed to fit over two burners, how does one avoid exposure to open flame. My griddle discolored and scratched from the get-go, even with very low heat.Nathan's Grill and Griddle selling at half this price is an exact clone with the same problems mentioned in the previous paragraph.The grill/griddle combo that worked well was from Lodge and made of cast iron. Well-seasoned, it works like a trooper."
1,Bad fit...,"FYI, those of you with square burners will not like this one. It is not stable because of the design, which is clearly meant for round burners."
3,Not Non-Stick,"I was looking for a large grill/griddle that was non-stick, it was almost impossible to find at a fair price.I thought that the Nordic grill was the one for me...It is a good grill in that it has a nice size and heats up very well, but the REAL PROBLEM is that it is NOT NON-STICK!!I don't know what Nordic's idea of non-stick is but this ain't it!If you don't use some Pam spray on it and your grill any meat on it, I promise you IT WILL STICK to the grill! I made that mistake the first time I used it and I nearly had to sandblast the crud off of it and almost ruined the finish. Buyer beware."
1,Stick-City,"If you want easy cleaning, don't buy this one! If you like to scrub, scrub, scrub, then look no further.Difficult to clean after first use. Cleaning between ""groves"" requires lots of work. Not worth the price."
2,Definitely STICKY Non-Stick!,"This one of the most difficult non-stick items I've ever encountered - even when treated with cooking spray. I must say it heats up nicely, but I HATE cleaning it. It will be yard sale item soon."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I would have given this no stars but it won't let me. This non-stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape. It is simply the worst product I have purchased in a long time. I have this ""non-Stick"" griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash. The non-stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless, it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds. Don't buy it!!! If you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like I did before it met the old trash can."
1,not nonstick,"and it warps even at medium low heat for 5 minutes. Always hard to clean. I have had it for 5 years now and now I realize I should have bought a new one, this time, I am getting Lodge."
1,garbage,"My wife and i bought this at bed bath and beyond. i thought it was a bit pricey but expected it to be great. no matter what we did everything we cooked stuck to it like glue. after contacting the company this is the response we got ""We don't recommend using the cooking sprays as most were not made for non-stick surfaces. You would be better using a solid shortening as listed in the use and care or even an olive oil or vegetable oil. Also, be careful not to overheat the pan- it is to be used only with moderate heat. High temps will cause damage to the pan.""- we threw it away."
1,"Bad product, don't buy","Use it the first time to grill some steak. I put vegetable oil all over and food stuck to the coating like hell and it looks worser than my 20 year old charcoal grill. This is not non-stick even the product say it is. What a rip off. Read some of the comments here that it can only be used on low heat and need to soak overnight to clean. Am I reading this wrong, a stove top grill plate that can only use on low heat? What a piece of junk. My $10 non stick saute pan work better than that and it cleans off easily. I am throwing this junk away. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A RIP OFF. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE."
2,Doesn't set on stove,The stated measurement of the griddle are accurate. But the angled drain troughs don't allow the griddle to sit down on the stove rack. So one side sits high and causes liquid to fall to one side of grill and it slides all over the top of the stove when your trying to turn food. It cooks the food fine once it stops rolling but its impossible to keep stable on the stove top. My stove is only 2 years old so it should fit on top. I wasted my money and I won't be using it again.
1,"This grill pan does not come clean, the griddle is ok","This grill pan does not come clean, we grill chicken breast with seasoning. I can not get the grill completly clean. The griddle is ok."
1,Not Non-stick!,"I purchased this from Kohl's (under the Food Network label). Luckily, they have a good return policy, because after one use, it's heading back there! I used it to make grilled chicken breasts, asparagus and portobello mushrooms. The food came out great and didn't stick, and had a nice grilled flavor. Then I tried to clean it -- to no avail. I tried everything I know -- soaking it, boiling water and vinegar in it, baking soda, elbow grease -- nothing worked. I only had it on medium heat, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm going to take it back and get a cast iron one."
1,Buyer beware!,"After one use (french toast), the supposed non-stick coating came off. At one point, it even appeared as if the coating was burning off, and I was only using medium heat. Also, it would not stay stable on my square gas burners. I returned it and will never purchase Nordic Ware again. Buyer beware!"
3,Have used it often for many years,"I've used this for a lot of my cooking, most often in the oven when broiling and pancakes. Initially it cleaned up easily, but gradually over a time, the non-stick coating started coming off (have we been eating it?). Now it's very difficult to clean unless I get to it right away, and the dishwasher won't even clean it.Still, I haven't found a replacement and I'm here looking for one that will do all the things it did and fit in my oven. My tendency is to buy the same one and hope it lasts. But maybe the coating comes off faster now, based on some reviews I'm seeing here.Edit: After repurchasing this to replace the one I'd used for many years, I found it to be quite different from the old one. This one is about half the weight and thickness of the old one. So far, the coating is lasting. The cleanup is not quite as easy as when it was new, though it's not a problem. Yet. Warning - you aren't supposed to subject it to high temperatures. Hmmm."
2,"Stick, Stick, Stick","Non-stick it aint. OK for a few months, but after that, everything seems to stick. And the surface is no longer flat -- it has developed some weird bumps. I wanted to stay away from cast iron because of maintenance, but cast aluminum is much worse."
2,This is not non stick!,"I bought this as I liked that it had two different type sides and big, also suppose to be nonstick!!!..Will only some of that part is true, but the first time I made Pancakes in it, It worked real well , the second time, no matter how much oil I put on the grill they stuck and it won't come off..Then I fried Bacon! Now you would think that Bacon cannot not stick!! Wrong, they did, two lbs. of bacon....The only thing I can say that is good about this is, it seems to cook pretty even, and its big, thought that deserved 2 stars...But big deal if everything sticks to it, and you can't even get it clean!!"
1,Not such a great grill pan,This not what you would call a great pan. The only thing that doesn't stick to it is veggies. After only 2 uses the coating started flaking off and the blasted thing warped! I should have just added a couple of dollars and gotten one that was actually usable. Very disappointing.
2,As many waves as the ocean blue!,"Ok, not a bad grill to cook on, I've been enjoying it for about 6 months now, but have to replace it because it doesn't like high heat (huh?). Never did. I'm using it on a glass cooktop, it does cook great...heats up fast, I do fish tacos, grilled chicken, pancakes etc. and it heats up in a few minutes. Problem is, it's no longer flat and developed waves like the ocean blue in just a couple of uses. in other words it's now totally warped! ... this was a disappointment, however, it was fun while it lasted... about 2 weeks! I'm going to upgrade to something I hope won't warp and has a replacement guarantee if it does."
2,No matter what it will stick,I bought this grill few years ago and figured it would work out great to cook meat. But it always left hard to remove stuck on food to surface. It also can not be scrubbed hard without removing non stick coating but to remove coating even though the coating did not help. It also turned brown and dicolored by the 2nd use. I returned product figuring it was defect in coating but next one did exact same. I would say pass on this product. Go for the lodge cast iron grill sold on amazon. Unlike this alum coated grill its a good hard surface that a good steel wool cleaning pad would clean off without hurting surface easy plus cast iron is a better heatig surface to cook on.I learned my lesson as I see others have commented as I have. Dont you be one to learn our lessons.
2,warping,"This is not a product that I would recommend to anyone. The basic concept is great but it doesn't fit well over the burners, it is not non-stick and mine became very warped and twisted under high heats to sear steaks. This warping rendered the grille useless and had to be discarded."
5,REVERSIBLE GRILL/GRIDDLE,WE TRULY ENJOY THE GRILL ON OUR BARBEQUE FOR FISH AS WELL AS MIXED SUMMER VEGETABLES TOSSED IN OLIVE OIL AND FRESH HERBS. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THE GRIDDLE WHEN OUR WEATHER COOLS DOWN FOR FRENCH TOAST ETC. GREAT PRODUCT AND EASY CLEANUP!
4,Haunted House Trip Hop,"This is the kind of music your grandmother would make if she was evil... evil in that kind-of-smiley way... extremely pale blue eyes,.... her clothes are old victorian lacework outfits, dusty and spiderweb ridden... and she's always hanging around up in her pitch-black attic with her victrola, sharpening her vintage silverware knives and talking/cackling to herself about manners... she also loves to dance, drink absynth, and sing in a raspy way that you could swear was sexy if you closed your eyes. Spppoooooky... good stuff, this is the kind of moody music that captures the way that I used to feel around Halloween when I was a little kid. Sorely underrated. Check it out."
5,Happy Joe smiles a pleasant smell,"Well, first off I must say that I was pretty surprised at how good this cd actually is. I'd heard some good things about it from my grandma, but I don't really like her taste of music, so I headed to the local record store and bought it, a highlight would be ""Pleasant Smell"" (is good ya?) I recommend this disc to anyone who..."
5,vampire pop,"if i was asked to describe this band's peticular sound, i'd simply have two words- vampire pop. this album is a beautiful spin on the trip hop sound. the vocalist has and amazingly original rhaspy, almost drugged vocal style that slowly sucks one in and never quite lets go.this album and this band are one of those rare gems one comes across...unfortunately the future of the band and the possibility of album number 3 look quite grim."
2,Cheaters 3,This DVD was a complete duplicate from other Cheaters DVDs. Nothing new included in set.Most of #2 have the same clips.
5,A great collection of interviews,"Portrait of a Swashbuckler is an Errol Flynn bonus bonanza as it contains a documentary, which is close to one hour in duration, and nearly two hours of additional interview material.The documentary contains Flynn film footage and extracts of interviews from family, friends, and colleagues, and the bonus material includes extended versions of the interviews.I was particularly pleased to receive valuable insights from Nora Eddington and Beverly Aadland.Given the passing of many who knew Flynn, this detailed offering produced in 1983 was timely in capturing so many stories and perspectives.It is difficult to separate this work and The Adventures of Errol Flynn documentary, so I strongly recommend watching both.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
5,Errol Flynn & Hollywood,"This is a must have DVD for any fan of Errol Flynn. It will stay in my home movie library forever. It really is very well done, with some fantastic interviews. I also loved Olivia de Havilland, they had such cemistry together on-screen & off. It seemed her heart had been broken when she found out he'd died so young. This is a very moving & sad tell all of his life, with warts & all. But it doesn't take away from how wonderfully talented & loved he was as an actor. He will always be Captain Blood & Robinhood to me..."
3,Errol Flynn a nazi?,"Flynn was a great star, but was he a nazi? 'The Adventures of Errol Flynn' does not deal with all the dirt Charles Higham dug up. If Flynn wasn't a nazi, he chose some very queer chums. Higham suggests British spooks identified Flynn as a nazi agent in WWII, & then 'turned' him - blackmailed him into working for the Allies. His file in the UK is still secret. Rum business, eh?I seem to remember from one of David Niven's autobiographies, how Flynn used to insult Jewish figures in Hollywood. Is my memory going, or does anyone else recall this?"
1,Awful customer service,"So I ordered a size Large as a gift for Christmas. As I ordered I realized that there were only a few left and was happy I ordered in time. When I got it in the mail it was a size medium, definitely not going to work. I contacted the company to get it resolved asap in time for Christmas and all I have received in return is an automated refund and then email to print out a return label to ship back the wrong product. No actual email from the company...only automated responses. I also noticed there are no more larges left...perfect. So instead of apologizing or even talking to a real person about how this could be resolved I now have no Christmas gift to show thanks to this company. Will not ever purchase from again!The hat itself...was fine... unfortunately the company needs to send it's HR to business school."
1,Weird Looking Bear!,"It might be the authentic symbol of the Cubs from the begining, but the face has a large dolphin like beak for a mouth. Also there was a third ear or a horn like projection off of the head. I just couldn't get over it and returned it rather than give it out as a gift."
5,"Best Looking Cubs Hat, Ever","Purchased the hat as a gift for my brother-in-law who is a huge Cubs fan. The hat was so distinctive I knew he wouldn't have it -- so, the perfect gift. I was very impressed with the quality of the material and construction. The design is great, particularly because it is quite low-key -- you really need to look at the logo to figure it out. Very special hat -- great gift!"
5,A wonderful play,"I just saw a wonderful production of this play at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge. The playbill said that it was part of a trilogy. I was hoping to find the other two here. I believe they were called the Lieutenant of Inishmore and The Banshees of Inisheer. This play might have resonated with me a little more deeply because my great-grandparents emigrated from the Aran Islands to Boston, and I can't help but think they made the right decision."
4,Nice Engine Bling,"Got this kit for my 2011 Silverado. Looks great, and easy to put on after some practice. Was bummed to find out the large radiator hose piece doesn't cover the entire hose, but with a piece left over from another set I had, I was able to piece it together in a spot hidden by the intake. Not ideal, but it works. If it was longer, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,DVD PLEASE!,"This is a funny, entertaining movie in a way movies aren't made anymore. I can't wait for the DVD!"
2,"If This is Tuesday, It must be Belgium","The quality of the DVD was absolutely terrible, the picture kept going off and there would just be snow on the screen. I think whoever copied this did not know what they were doing."
2,If this is Tuesday Its not as glamorous as I remembered!,"I saw the movie in a theater in the 1960s. I had not scene it since. I was disappointed that the scenes of Europe were not as impressive as I remembered. I guess I've seen a lot of movies since that show a lot more of Europe than this movie did. Also I have stayed in London & visited Paris & Prauge and got to see a lot more places in a short time. I guess filmimng Europe like that in the 1960s but lot of James Bond & other movies shot in exotic forien locations has made ""Tuesday..."" much less glamorous than I remembered."

5,Reliving the horrors of the Bus Tour,"If you've ever gone on a whirlwind bus tour, you'll find a lot to identify with in this hysterically funny send-up of the tourist business. We see all the things that can and do happen, especially the funny (peculiar?) people on the bus with you. Suzanne Pleshette is the cute American tourist on the bus who falls for the dashing tour guide, played by Ian McShane. He has a girl in every port and happily adds the naive Suzanne to his list.The tour group is made up of some great character actors (especially Norman Fell and Reva Rose) who take too many pictures, talk too much, steal everything from the hotels, and generally make Americans look sily. The scenery is great as the bus speeds from England to Italy in just a few days. The film is quick-paced, with lots of sight gags and a little romance, too. A great popcorn movie."
3,If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium,"There are two things about this film that made an impression on me when I first saw it in the movie theater during the late sixties: Suzanne Pleshette and fondues. I thought Suzanne Pleshette was breathtakingly beautiful. And fondues! I had never heard of fondues before seeing this film, and thought it was the coolest fun food ever. Needless to say I've developed a love for fondues over the years (cheese, chocolate, et al), and continue to enjoy them as often as possible.What I didn't remember about ""Tuesday"" is how entertaining it is, and how much nostalgia it brings back. Yes it's dated, but, then again, so am I -- so what! I enjoyed seeing Marty Ingalls, Peggy Cass, and Sandy Baron again, fixtures on T.V. many years ago. It may not be a critic's classic, but it is a movie I will watch over and over again."
3,"If it's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.","Although this is an old movie, that I saw in the theater years ago, I wanted to see it again to compare it with my own experience when I took a tour in Europe recently. There must be another one with Jack Lemon that I recall that was a ""tour"" movie that was very funny but I can't find it listed anywhere."
2,"If it is tuesdasy, this must be Belgium","I bought this DVD just to see Suzanne Pleshette again. I was a bit disappointed as Suzanne Pleshette had too much make up and wig and did not have the grace and simplicity when she did that unforgettable "" Rome Adventure "". The only time she looked magical and alluring was when she was wearing that blue top which in itself was the only scene worth watching ...."
3,Pleasing Entertainment,"Amusing tale of a group of American tourists on a whistle-stop bus tour of various European countries.There's nothing very new or dramatic in this feature, but it is well performed and doesn't outstay its welcome. The cast is good too, though I almost didn't recognize the young Ian McShane.Rating: 6.5 out of 10."
3,"Funny, hardly seen good movie","You never see this movie on TV, I first saw it as a kid when it came out at the local theater, for many years after that I couldn't remember its name until I had it pop into my head last year so I bought it. I was not disappointed, very funny, late 60's period movie that is overlooked for sure. Well worth getting, I hope it comes to DVD soon."
1,One of the worst movies of all time!,"My family and I are planning a trip to Europe and I thought this would be a good film to see before the trip. I could not locate it at video stores and was excited to find it available at Amazon.com. The movie is rated ""G"", but is not suitable for children. Most of the movie revolves around sexual situations. Several ""unmarried bedroom scenes"" are shown. I think it was rated ""G"" based on the loose morals of the late ""60's"". Today it probably would be rated ""PG-13"".Overall, I could not have been more disappointed. The few funny moments were not worth the torture of the rest of the movie. Please do not see this movie unless you have a strong desire to be disappointed."
4,freaked out on acid,"um this sample starts out sounding like that thrill kill kult song on ""christian zombie vampires"" where are they getting this sample from/?"
5,Understanding the love of fishing,"If you fish, you'll love this book. If you don't fish (but have a loved one that does) you'll love this book. Dick Russell chronicles the history of saving the bass in a noncomplicated, factual, way. He also includes the personalities of members of both sides. It makes you stop and wonder what humans are doing to our environment. If you do stop and think, it can be downright scary. Anecedotes are included about individual fisherman that let you recognize your own fisherman in your family. You wonder who wrote the anecdote(Russell or your fisherman). You end up appreciating the fish and its waters and hopefully understand that it is everyone's responsibility to protect all. Catch and release!"
5,Striper Wars-Awesome,"Dick Russell has captured one of the most acurate, historical accounts of what took place in the early 1980's to save the striped bass from near extinction. His recall of details is nothing short of amazing.Striper Wars is extremely well written, entertaining, informative and above all a message that what happened 25 years ago could happen again.If you are a striped bass angler you owe it to yourself to read Striper Wars- oen of the best historical accounts ever written about this amazing gamefish.Capt Jim White"
3,Average movie,I was attracted to watch this movie because of its high average star rating. Other than good acting there was nothing special about the movie. You would need patience for this movie as it certainly is not gripping nor is it a thriller. Bottomline: It is average movie with a higher than average rating on Amazon.
5,"Excellent, lucid book on manifolds","Topics are explained with exceptional clarity; portions of the book are well tied together; and the order of exposition flows very well. Lie groups are introduced quite early on, but their full power is not revealed until later in the book. I can't laud this book enough. I had a firm, well-developed basis of differential geometry after reading through this book for a course. The excersises are illuminating, as are the examples. Theorems and their proofs are clearly labeled. The motivational explanations prefacing theorems do an excellent job of conveying the intuition behind ideas.I would recommend this book over Boothby any day. I haven't read Spivak, so I can't compare Lee to it, but Lee definitely seemed like an excellent choice for an intro grad class on differential geometry."
4,get the hardcover!!,"I just finished a 20-week course from this book. It is well-written, with a healthy number of examples and many exercises (interspersed throughout the text) and problems (at the end of each chapter). The style is rather informal: this is good for the novice to this subject, which groans under the weight of its own notation. The presentation is well-organized, clear, and accessible. Dr. Lee maintains current errata for the book (some did make it into the problems unfortunately) at his website.One thing I might suggest is that if you plan to use this book heavily (e.g., for a course rather than for reference or bedtime reading) you should consider investing in the hardcover version is possible. The book is lengthy and the binding tends to split. Mine is still in one piece, but only just. You have to be very gentle with this book to keep it intact."
2,Mostly Average,"I bought this book because I thought I'd learn something new . The pictures are nice enough, & it being in both Italian & English (although not always precisely translated) is neat.But most of the gestures are universal, not unique to Italy (the international signal for ""check please"" or ""to read"") which was a little dissapointing. The more Italian gestures are not well explained in terms of context, but are entertaining enough.If I were to do it over again, I might buy the book but only for under $9"
1,Two Thumbs Down,This is one of those books that is better in theory than it is in practice. In reality the only practicle gesture is the one on the cover of the book. The stories and anecdotes that go along with some of the gestures are cute and funny but really this is a novelty and not a study guide by any means. I give this book two thumbs down.
2,Dated and not all that useful,"At one point in the narrative the author recommends that you read some of your wife's pregnancy books to get an idea what's going on. That is the best advice this book has to offer. Read another book.I found most of what was advised here to be dated and not all that useful given the changing roles in modern America. Most men do not need to read hints on how to make canned soup and the recipe for ""Tuna Chowder"" made my wife's stomach churn when I read it out loud. The entire chapter on what to do while in the waiting room seems superfluous in contemporary society where the husband accompanies his wife during the delivery.There are some good words of wisdom peppered through the 1950s mentality though. Let your wife know you love her and that she's attractive. Get involved with the process right from the start and... and.....Sorry. That's about all I could glean from this thing. I just saved you ten bucks."
4,For the Busy Dad-to-Be,"I bought this book for my husband shortly after we learned I was pregnant. I read it first and thought it was perfectly short and direct for the first-time and somewhat-frightened busy father-to-be. My husband didn't read it until after our baby boy was born. At which point, enraptured by our son,he read it from front to cover and tried out all the recipes included during my first couple of weeks home. The recipes are simple, but really, really delicious. He still refers to it for certain dishes. My bet is that he will read it again, but at the beginning of my next pregnancy -- not the end of it!"
3,Short and Cute but slightly outdated,"I think it's a good first book for a guy to read, besides the obvious things to not do, like going out for some drinks when you find out she's pregnant, the rest of the advice is general and okay. Be attentive to your wife, let her know you are there for her, attend to her needs, etc. Not bad advice, but when a book tells you have plenty of quarters to call people from the hospital, you have to remember to take this with a grain of salt.As a first book I recommend it because it's a light read, but I definitely recommend reading MORE books :)"
2,if all you need is a laugh or two..................,"The author has tried to cover too much ground, with the usual result that much of it is skimmed. You may be able to glean a few good points, but don't put all your hopes in this being your sole source of information, it just can't do it. Not only is it generally flighty but also occasionally ill-informed; ""giving a pregnant woman champagne"". If it had been a clear-cut comedy book I could respect that, but the chuckles are weak and a few are not even funny being disrespectful to women. I have been a bit harsh perhaps in reviewing this book, if this is not the only book/class/etc the expectant father learns from it is ok as a mild humor book. Hopefully it will prompt the purchase of a more accurate and informative book."
5,The most readable account of the Lebanon War,This is the most complete and readable account of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon I have come across. Fisk uses his experiences as a journalist to recount the horror of this war. He also manages to write with compassion and understanding for the people on the receiving end of this invasion. Fisk lust also be given credit for maintaining his objectivity. After reading this book I began searching for a copy of my own. Only find that it was out of print. I believe that all of us who are interested in honest accounts of this war need to strongly question why such a book is no longer in print. Robert Fisks book is an invaluable resource to all who wish to understand the events leading up to the present Israeli/Palestinian situation.
4,"A good book , without indulgence","I am lebanese and I lived in Lebanon during the 15 years ofwar . I read the book and I think it contains an accurateaccount of the main events in the war ,and a good descriptionof the people involved in the conflict (militias, foreign armies,etc ) But I find Fisk is too harsh when he suggests thatall lebanese statesmen or politicians were feudal warlords,or as he says , ""mafiosi."" Some were , and some others werelawyers , bankers ,etc. It is true ,however , that most of thesebecame at some point allies of a warlord ,or were forcedto flee the country. Nevertheless, I think a reader would get a morebalanced view of Lebanon , if he reads *in addition* to thisbook , Kamal Salibi's ""A house of many mansions"" or ""crossroadsto civil war"" . Salibi is infinitely more sympathetic thanFisk to the idea of the creation of the Lebanese state, and Ithink it is necessary to read both books to have a balanced view."
1,No Mac OS X PDF software included.,This scanner does not work with Mac OS X. I down loaded the Mac OS X drivers. You can scan to Jpeg and Tiff. The results are hard to read. I called the company about the save to PDF software. They told me they do not have this software for Mac OS X. They said that I would need to by Adobe Acrobat Professional 8 if I wanted to save to PDF. They also said that the one step button on the top of the scanner to scan to PDF will not work in Mac OS X. One other problem is that it has no auto crop software so any small document is scanned and the rest of the page is black. I have sent this scanner back.
2,The Llama Farmers Grow Fuzzy,"Though the single ""Yellow"" by the Llama Farmers is pleasant and soothing at first, it soon begins to grate on the nerves. Its over-sentimental feel repels, rather than attracts, the sensitive listener. If you like the Llama Farmers, you might mildly enjoy this song, but the public, as a general rule, should beware."
1,This does NOT fit the 2006 Hyundai Sonata V6,The oil filter for the 2006 sonata v6 is a drop in element. The only place I have found them is the dealer.
4,Simple muffins that anyone can easily make,"What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total. Many other mixes make 12 or more, and, if you have a small household, you're stuck with way too many muffins.These were better than expected - they are soft, flavorful, and baked perfectly. Also, use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking.It isn't the healthiest food out there, but overall, I'd recommend this mix."
3,Quick and easy muffins,"These aren't going to win you any bake-offs, but they are a good item to keep in the pantry. I always try to keep some on hand in case I have to whip up breakfast in a hurry.You can literally have them in the oven in less than 3 minutes. I usually add some Trader Joe's vanilla protein powder to add some nutritional weight to them. You could also toss in some chocolate chunks for a treat.I don't know what's up with the ""charging for flavor"" review. That's not really a review of the product but rather a review of the price. Anyway, this is a good value."
1,Charging for Flavor,"How come Blueberry now (2011) cost more then Banana Nut or Chocolate Chip. It is the same product , the same company and the same size, the only difference is the flavor. Customers should not have to pay extra for a different flavor. Were do Amazon get this from.This is like charging $.50 for a pack of tropical punch Kool-aid, $.40 for a pack of orange, and $.30 for a pack of Wild Berry, mind you that it is all the same size. What is this?, is it that Blueberry taste better then Banana Nut? So Amazon is charging for the flavor. What the Hey? Amazon gets to say which flavor is better.This is like saying Coke is better then Pepsi, this is not for Amazon to decide."
3,The Gluten-Free Pantry Coffee Cake Mix,"The mix is good for the lovers of sticky/a bit raw dough in the middle... Otherwise, do not put half of the crumb filling inside at all - will work fine and bake well on top of the dough. Do not expect the loaf to be exactly the same as the regular flower one and you'll like it. Anyway, it is better than nothing :-)))"
3,Good but not Wow.....,"I love Kathryne Kennedy and while I did enjoy this book, it was a little annoying at the same time. I just found Mahri to be a bit too dramatic and uncooperative so to speak....a bit unreal in her demands or expectations."
1,blah blah blah,"I started to read the sample of this book and absolutely could not get past the first couple pages. So confusing and the idea of someone falling in love with a swamp rat does not appeal to me at all. I'm just happy that Kathering Kennedy has much MUCH better books out there. I also love her book ""Fire Lords Lover""! Great read! I'm also anxious to see if there are more to her ""Merlins Relics"" books. Those were also great reads for me as well! Keep up all the magic and fantasy with those books and I'll keep on coming back for more!!"
3,"Medically sound, but a waste of money","This is actually backed by scientific evidence. Go to www.webmd.com and type in ""milk weight loss"" in the search field and you'll find there's evidence to show that while calories count, making some of your calories dairy food can almost double the speed of your weight loss.Don't buy this book, however, since I can sum it up for you right now:1) Eat 1500 calories a day.2) Make some of it ice cream."
5,holy ...,"this game is the best! way better then your stupid halo. it has more weapons, longer, and much better graphics. and some of you are saying how good the game is but forgot to pu stars! you are hurting this awsome game!"
4,"Domo Arigato ,Mr Glitch Roboto","I liked this game. You die a lot, so don't have a breakdown if you have to start at the checkpoint again, however, you have infinite lives. I love the weapons in the game, especially the explosive ones. Metal Arms Sports good cutscenes. At the beginning, it makes fun of Public Information films, with the history of Iron Star.b BUY THIS GAME. BTW, im 14, no personal info I want to share."
4,halo,if any of you played halo or ratchet and clank or jak and daxter you'll love this game . I've played this game its the best .its at the top of my christmas list .xbox mag gave it a 9.1. love this game I'm 14 not 12
1,Not so great -,"I'm a beginner, in the first tutorial ""modeling binoculars"" so many of the steps are not explained - Turn on Snap to Points mode - no instructions on howto. The author lost me after step 15..And then the rest of the chapter is a loss. I wouldn't get the book if I was just starting out learning Maya.."
5,The Best I Have Ever Seen,"Prison song is the most amazing movie i have ever seen. I have seen it a ton of times and still every time, i cry. It has such a moving story line, you get absorbed in it the second you turn it on. I have been searching for the soundtrack, but especially the artist and songtitle of the closing track during the credits. It is a beautifully written and acted movie, i recommend it to anyone who is interested in Q-Tip or the movie itself. You will never forget the impact that Prison Song has on your life."
3,"Good, but has a significant problem","On the plus side, this book exhaustively presents lots of species, including quite a few not covered in other popular guides, and in general, the photos are very good in all respects save one: the color accuracy. It appears that there has been little or no attempt to use color management when it came time to reproduce the photos. It appears that the mushrooms were all photographed in-studio rather than in the field, against a gray background. To appreciate how much the color reproduction varies, just look at the gray background in each photo, and you'll see just how off the color really is.Other than that, I'd give the book 5 stars, but accurate color is very important in a book like this, so I give it 3 stars."
3,more data,"This book does contain data that is usefull. However, it would not be my first or second choice. The National Audubon Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Mushrooms, and the Smithsonian Handbooks MUSHROOMS all are better, listed in order of my preference at this time."
5,Terrific book!,"This book has a ton of great pictures and descriptions. I bought this book for my fiance who is a mushroom inthusiast. There were many times when we would be taking a walk and he would wonder if mushrooms we saw were edible. He keeps the book in his car, and it's a great reference guide. The descriptions let us know where to expect certain mushrooms, if they are edible or not, and what they taste like.I highly recommend this book for new mushroom hunters!"
5,gunsmoke,"i would have rather purchase season after season, instead of certain episodes, because the product had some episodes that were not my favorites. thank you"
5,Love it---ready for more volumes!,This is great. I also bought V. 1 and am ready for V. 3. Well worth my money.
5,ginger AZ,This 50th anniversary Gunsmoke is in color and black and white and has hour long western episodes It has commentary for all movies. There is 12 episodes.It has blooper and gag reels.
5,"Gunsmoke 50th anniversary collection, volume 2","I'm sorry, I an running out of words to review the Gunsmoke Dvds that I order. They are all great"
5,the bullet,"does volume 2 include the remarkable 3 part drama, ""the bullet"" written by jim byrnes? this remains my favorite gunsmoke episode(s)! i would never purchase this set without its inclusion along with ""baker's dozen"" that earned milburn stone a long overdue Emmy and ""The Snow Train."""
2,Ginseng,"This product did not seem to work for me. In comparing it with other Siberian Ginseng, the one without alcohol worked better. This is about 50% Alcohol."
2,didnt seem to do anything for me,Didnt appear to give me more energy or anything.On the other hand it didnt seem to do me any harm either.
3,"Interesting Biographies, but...","I read a biography of someone I know well and I was saddened by, in my humble opinion, some exaggeration and revision of history. It should have been unnecessary."
4,"The Russian Avant-Garde book, 19101934","This companion volume to a major MoMA exhibition is a treasury for graphic designers and bibliophiles, but it also provides a fascinating portrait of artists who began by spitting in the eye of the bourgeosie, became zealous stalwarts of the revolution, and finally reverted to the status of outsiders, as Stalins apparatchiks snuffed out every trace of invention. The earliest work has a child-like spontaneityÑcrude sketches on cheap paper illustrating tiny editions of poets work. Theres a gradual shift to abstraction in the work of such masters as El Lissitsky and Rodchenko, and finally a slide into the banality of socialist realism. A fascinating portrait of artistic struggle and defeat."
1,Don't buy it!!! You may already have it!!,What a rip off! Why would anybody want to buy what they already have. The episodes that are on these dvd's I already have. Not only that the box says 3 disks and in fact there are only two. Really disappointed!!! Just to think I bought it two months ago for this. WOW!!!!
5,Awesome,"This is a must have CD. It takes you into the place where God is. I normally like fast paced songs but ""Bow Down"" really touched my soul. I had no other choice but to bow down when I heard it. If you don't like anything else on this CD, for this song alone, it is worth having. But I guarantee you will love it, in its entirety!"
4,Real Blues the Way It Was Meant to Be Played,"Ashlee Simpson fans would not appreciate this CD. This is real blues played live in a relaxed setting.The setting is a city street in Chicago. In the background can be heard cheers of encouragement from the artist's friends, and occassionally a truck engine or car horn can be heard. This was not done in a studio with 157 takes and then technologically enhanced. This is real.Robert Nighthawk was an extremely laid back yet talented musician. As I listen to this CD, I wonder why he wasn't huge."
4,dirty and rough blues,yikes/this is rough and raw and hot--the first track gives me the chills and is worth the price of admission....
3,Just another cell phone...,"The reasons people are giving for not liking this phone are all problems that seem to be with the provider not the phone (service in certain areas etc)! The phone is a bit larger than other phones on the market but has great battery life. While the flip around screen is cool, it is annoying after a while to have to keep flipping and such. It would be such a better phone if it had a caller ID window on the other side in addition. The camera does what it is supposed to do i suppose.. let's face it: it's a camera phone, not a nikon. All and all it's just another cell phone in my humble opinion... just a matter of personal preference. It does everything it is supposed to do. I have had no problems with it."
1,Be prepared to get it fixed a lot,"I have had major problems with the one screw holding the flip together withe the rest of the phone. It loosens up and your flip is no longer stable you have to go get that screw tightened or do it yourself. If for some reason you don't get it tightened in a timely manner the the ribbon cable will get damaged and your phone will break in one fashion or another. I am on the third of this phone. First one lost audio, second lost the screen. Verizon refuses to do anything about my dissatisfation with this phone. They will just keep replacing this one. I have had one nice manager say he would let me void the last year of my contract so that I could buy a new phone and sign a new contract with him. Not biting. I have been with Verizon 8 years but, I am going to go to Verizon corporate, and if they can also do nothing for me I am finishing out my contract and going to another company. All this over one phone."
5,great phone,"great reception, great screen, good sound, long lasting battery,attractive, always 5 bar service, previous reviewer on drugs.5 stars or 6 if were possible."
3,Are these the only Best of Season 1?,"The quality of the DVD is excellent. I wish it had come with English subtitles as well as Spanish. I cannot argue with the choice of episodes, but why only five? It would have gotten five stars if it had included episodes such as ""Target: Angels"" (which featured a pre-Magnum Tom Selleck as Kelly Garrett's date), ""Angels In the Army"", and the one about Jill working under-cover as a roller derby babe."
5,nice,i liked this book very much. it inspired and motivated me and then told me how to take the action on the advice. i especially like the stories with a high relatability factor and the action-items. one of the more valuable books in the health/fitness genre i've read.
3,Feel good motivation,"If you are looking for an easy read that can provide some feel good motivation in your busy life, this book hits the mark. The author adds plenty of color and a bit of philosophy to his fitness advice. As you read it, you can't help but feel like you have the author right there by your side. However, I wouldn't recommend it to people looking for more scientific guidance for their workout routines."
5,This Guy is Amazing,"I bought Eric Harr's book last week. It is absolutely stellar. Then this week, I was flipping through The New York Daily News and saw his piece on mountain biking. This guy is something very special. His book stands apart from all the fitness books on the shelves and HE stands apart from all the over-hyped fitness authors peddling their wares on television today.The Portable Personal Trainer is a first-rate guide to fitness, motivation and life and I recommend it to everyone without reservation!! You'll be thrilled with this book."
5,Nice Read,"My wife bought this book for me. She already owns it and wouldn't give up her copy (the author signed it!).I'm very skeptical of health/fitness books, products, etc. It seems like a circus to me. But I really did enjoy Harr's book. It's to-the-point, makes a lot of sense and it's easy to read. Tip a day. That's what my wife does ... and I think I'll follow her lead.This is a book certainly worth picking up no matter what your fitness goals or background."
5,This is just a great book,"This book gets right to the heart of fitness in 100 very easy to understand strategies. It covers burning more fat during exercise, staying motivated to workout, eating smarter, even advanced workout tips, which I really like. I'm a fairly serious runner and the book hits the mark.I actually saw the author present a fitness seminar at The Learning Annex a few years back in San Francisco. He was one of the best, if not THE best, speakers I've ever seen. He reminded me of Tony Robbins.I'm glad to see Eric Harr's book is so well-liked on Amazon.com. I've only ever heard good things about this person and his book is a great stride forward for all of us trying to reach our own fitness goals."
5,Could Not Put This Book Down,"This book is so incredibly good that I couldn't put it down for two hours while lounging in the bookstore.I saw the author on television and was so impressed I went to Borders that night to check out his book. They were sold out. But, get this: the employees had their own copies! (That must be a good sign). So I leafed through his book and on EVERY SINGLE PAGE there is something of genuine value. In fact, I asked for a pad of paper and a pen and began taking notes furiously. Two hours later, I felt like I had absorbed years of exercise wisdom and inspiration. I was ready to launch a whole new fitness program -- and I had the know-how to do it!!I bought eight copies on Amazon, one for each of my best friends and my mom and dad. The book is so infectous and so uplifting, everyone is nuts about it.The Portable Personal Trainer is one of the best fitness books you'll ever read. You won't be able to put it down. Guaranteed."
2,cover,"while letters to cleo did a very good cover of this song, i still like the original better. does anyone know who sang the original?"
5,Exerpt from Books Ireland magazine review,"A marvellous, intelligent collection. Such work restores one's faith - Fred Johnston, Books Ireland"
4,Charming -- a classic!,"The story of a cat from newborn to new Mom. (the first and last pictures are the same.) The story is charming, but the illustrations are what keep my family coming back for another read."
2,Too bulky to use on my motorcycle,"When I got it I was very surprised at the thickness of the item. When you add it to your own mount (since it doesn't include a way to mount to the bike), it becomes a huge bulky item. Apparently they have some electronics in the bracket. I returned mine unused. I will just find a 12 volt outlet to mount on the bike and use the speaker/power plug that came with my Quest."
5,Garmin Quest Mount,This mount works very well. I've tested it on rough gravel roads and it's holding up well. Figuring it out how it installs takes a minute or two but once you have everything lined up it goes right on. Took me less than 30 minutes to wire it up on the RAM mount (which you need).
3,"Cool package, nice price.","For a dedicated photo printer, I enjoy the ease of getting prints with the Canon software interface. This little number produces nice output. Consumables deplete rapidly but they don't scare you at the register. Ink tanks can be had for under $10.Some trouble with white edges on borderless prints, but power cycling seems to solve it.Paper tray leaves sheets hanging out in front where they are in the way.I use this printer to get quick snaps for fun and transmit or take my serious stuff to the photo finisher for prints. That said I'm happy enough with this purchase as it fits my need without regrets."
5,Good Quality and Easy to Use,"Really Good Quality Photos! Extremely easy to setup! Reads photos from disk, directly from camera (yeah you don't have to upload them, and then print pictures) or you could use your laptop. This was a really great buy!"
1,POOR RESOLUTION AND SPEED,"THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD IN THEORY ONLY!! EVEN AT THE HIGHEST PHOTO QUALITY, THE PRINTED IMAGES ARE VERY GRAINY (USING A 6MP CAMERA).ALSO, IT IS VERY SLOW AT PRINTING EVEN THOSE POOR IMAGES. I LIKED THE SIZE OF THE PRINTER AND THE FACT THAT IT SUPPORTS BLUETOOTH, BUT I JUST CANNOT GET PAST THE POOR IMAGE QUALITY!! IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED OUT OF A DIGITAL PRINT 5 YEARS AGO!"
2,Was printing OK...then died!!,"I purchased this printer last week, I have about 200 pictures to print from a family vacation. I was able to print about 100 pictures, for the price of the printer, the pictures were not half bad!!I needed to purchase new cartridges. Let the printer sit for a few days and then put in the new cartridge. I went to turn the printer on a few hours later and nothing!! I then plugged and unplugged it a few time and finally the light on the on/off button started to blink, but nothing...the screen was blank and no movement. I hit a bunch of buttons..still nothing. I unplugged it again for few minutes, plugged it back in...no blinking lights...nada!! My poor little printer was DEAD!! The moral of the story...it lasts for 100 prints."
1,Didn't Work,"I bought the printer as a present for a girlfriend. I gave it to her and I left on vacation. When I returned she told me it did not work properly. I tried to do an exchange but I was told after 14 days they will not except it. I believe it is the cartridges that are bad and I asked if I could just exchange those, but was told the same thing. I now need to purchase another one."
2,Your Order Has Been Shipped -- I Mean Cancelled.,"I ordered and paid for a Canon SELPHY DS810 Photo Printer through Ritz Camera and received the usual multiple emails thankin me for my order, informing me that my printer ""has been shipped,"" and then ""your order has been cancelled"" because the item was no longer available. Hmmm...So which is it? Has the item been shipped, or has the order been cancelled. I don't know if this is a function of Amazon.com or of Ritz Camera, but I do know I won't believe it when they say an item is ""in stock"" or ""had been shipped."" Lies, all lies."
2,Very unhappy with this,"The printing quality is good, but that's the only positive thing I can say. There's no place to leave paper in the printer, the indicator about which side of the paper to have in the ""up"" position is misleading, leading two a complete mess as you waste ink printing the wrong side of the paper. Even worse, it only allows you to plug in proprietary devices: Try to plug your USB storage device or any non-Canon device into it and it tells you it's incompatible. I got a $[...] rebate and it's still not worth it."
3,Great printer for the price.,"The DS810 is a great printer for the price. I've had a few problems with print quality, and when i print several pictures back to back without giving the printer a break, it tends to spit little blue dots everywhere on the picture. Other than that its a great printer. Easy to use, easy to set up, and nice looking prints."
1,Canon Selphy DS810 photo printer,I replaced my old HP photo printer for this one. The buttons on the HP Printer were becoming difficult to make it work. The Canon Selphy printer was horrible. The quality of the prints didn't even come close to the HP quality. I could only print 15 photos before the cartridge became clogged and had to call tech support which didn't solve my problem. I returned the printer and will purchase an HP printer again. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
2,cannon selphy ds810 printer,"It works ok but it is very hard to find printer ink for it and when you do, it is quite expensive. The idea of having a small portable printer was very appealing, but I wouldn't do it again."
3,Just okay,"This printer is okay. I actually don't use it as much as I thought I would. I go the pharmacy machine as it is faster. Also if they get smudged I don't have to pay for them there. I have had a few pictures print out smudged. I wish it has more options. It's okay, but I probably wouldn't purchase it again."
4,Really good set.,"I have had this set for about a year and I have never lost interest in it.There are a lot of different places to put the minifigs in. It has 8 rooms.The entrance hall,potions class,dumbledores office,some useless trapdoor room, transfiguration class,another useless room,an owlery,and divination.Dont forget the Griffindor tower. Includes Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Ron weasley,Draco Malfoy,Professor Trelawney,and two dementors.Its worth the money but dont pay more than $90.00 for it.P.S. Trelawney splits in half quite easily.I recommend Elmers glue."
3,Disappointed-,We purchased this thinking it was new and when our grandson bought it it had been opened and pieces put in bags. Some were missing. When we bought it all that was said was that the box was a bit bent.
2,kinda cool,"it is ok. the first 1 was 10 times better! it has almost 10000 pieces! i love the clock though!!!! so if u want a set 2 play with, get the first 1, if u want 1 to look at get the second 1!!!"
3,Shooting table gets it done,"This table does a fine job for the price. Better directions for assembly would be appreciated and although it stands on it own, it could be sturdier."
5,freaking awesome rock songs (about cheese grits),"this cd reminds me of pulling a tweaked backside boneless one on a cement ditch in a small southern town. it rocks like a 20' bodyslam into the flat. it'll make your teeth hurt from the ""drunken grin"" it forces onto your face. i remember when i was very young. i was blameless. somebody take my pulse! i have been attacked by timer the strangler! unfortunately you can't hear the great chord in the ""over the moon"" sample - it makes you feel dirty."
5,Excellent record!,"This is an excellent record! I love how different all the songs are - it makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth. They sound a little like Lush or Cocteau Twins (which is good in my opinion) and the lyrics are very good. I like how there's lots of electronic noises, but it's still guitar-based. My favorite songs are Lonely, Shadow and Remember When We Were Very Young."
1,I prefer a flat non-stick pan,"We have never been able to get good crepes with this pan. If you dip the pan in the batter like they intend, the crepe basically cooks the moment you put the pan in, and then because it's nonstick, the (cooked) pieces fall off into the batter bowl. If you try to use a spoon of some sort to pour batter on the pan, it runs off. I recommend a non-stick, flat frying pan instead."
1,Difficult,"I was unable to make crepes according to the directions. Once the pan was hot, the crepe cooked in the batter bowl. Any suggestions?"
1,LET'S GET SOME THINGS STRAIGHT,"I tried to give this album a good listen, but I couldn't even get through half of it. From reading some of the other reviews, I gotta say that I greatly disagree with some fans that think that Les is the greatest bass player that ever was. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. To this day, I have never heard Les lay a groove that could ever compare to a Larry Graham, James Jamerson, Verdine White, Jaco Pastorius, Ron Carter, or Paul McCartney groove. THESE PLAYERS are a GREAT bass players. Furthermore, Les cannot sing to save his life. To call him a singer is like calling Puff Daddy a singer. You don't call a person who verbalizes only in spoken word a singer, do you? Another thing is the guitarist has always been one of the most unmusical guitarist I've ever heard. Of course, Primus is one of the most unmusical bands ever."
2,brain's drum solo sucked,"i like silly putty because at least stanley clarke is recognized one of the many bass players who is as good or better than les. les is great but he can't even compare with jaco, victor, stanley, and michael henderson. soem of the tracks were very good but when i heard brains drum solo at the end i wanted to scream herb was so much better than regardless of style. just because brain is horrible i will take a few stars off my rating."
3,Not too bad,"This record isn't a primus songs album. There are songs of Metallica, Stanley Clark (Auteuil Neuilly Passy, c'est pas du gteau, Auteuil Neuilly Passy, tel est notre ghetto! TU ""smack"" VAS ""smack"" BIEN! ),Peter Gabriel, etc... There are also 2 live tracks (Tommy and Bob), and with the password VIOLIN, you have a enhaced CD which is cool! If you are just discovering Primus, you must buy it."
4,"Great band, good album","Primus has made better albums, but this is still good stuff. The two live tracks are a real treat, same with Amos Moses and Silly Putty. This is not Primus, but is still similar in that this music is unique. P. S. did you know Les Clay pool tried to be Metallica's bass play after the old one died, but they thought he was too talented, and the songs would be too complex with him in the band."
3,Painful nostalgia!,"Kid's Superpower Hour with Shazam! is a nostalgic trip back to 1981 that made me cringe! I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Punk Rock actor, and producer Lou Scheimer, whom I've met. I even asked about Kid's Superpower Hour over lunch with Lou, when at the time I asked he didn't have much a memory about it among the pantheon of other wonderful accomplishments of Filmation.It was a fun rolic to the past, but I can tell these actors were only doing this as a first gig hoping to move onto other acting opportunities."
2,Your mind can trick you,"Not as good as I had remembered back in the 80s. Reality of how advanced animation has come, including storyboarding."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Don't waste your money purchasing the PDF files here, as they are likely from someone who downloaded them for free as a torrent."
2,Poor answer key,"The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error."
5,Great book,"This is really a great book in a hard to grasp subject.It is easy to follow ,has a lot of excellent sample problems and examples ,sudent-friendly and it is ideal for selfstudy."
5,One of the Best Books in Mechanics of Materials,This books is the only rival of the Hibbeler's book.It has full SI editions and it contains clear examples.It handles the concepts clearly and in detail. It is strongly recommended to engineering students to obtain this book with Hibbelers one.
2,Continues the tradition of needless and overpriced revisions.,"The last new substantial advance in basic mechanics of materials (the concept of shear center) was 80 or so years ago. Buy this new overpriced edition of the textbook only if required to for school. Den Hartog's ""Strength of Materials"" or an earlier version of Beer & Johnson or Popov will save you money without sacrificing any content."
3,Fernema's Analysis of the Launch Market,"This book was fact-filled and a wee bit dry; nonetheless, it gets the job done in setting the stage for what has unfolded after the ink dryed a few years ago. The author does good analysis of the international lauch market prior to 1999 but a lot has changed while much has remained the same. ITAR space technology export controls still a vexing issue that needs to be carefully vetted by the Congress in the 21st Century; but the Commercial Space Launch Amendments of 2004 has done a lot to change the content anaylsis of the book. One may read the book for historic context, as I did, but have the realization that the policy and law is dynamic. The material has aged. In future editions, I do suggest some visualizations and graphs along the way to give the reader more than simple straight text. Personally, I enjoyed the footnote references at the bottom of each page and the extensive bibliography."
4,"Good record of a fine performance, best if you know German","I bought this DVD because I'm teaching a class that is looking at both of these song cycles, and I thought it would be nice to show a live performance. While Fischer-Dieskau is not in his prime here, he has always been a great singer and the performance is fine. I have not been able to find a way to get any subtitles for the songs, however, and, while texts are printed in the booklet that comes with the DVD, they are only in German. I haven't had a chance to view the bonus DVD of ""Balladen"" which includes Schumann's ""Ballade von Haideknaben"" Op. 122 no. 1, Liszt's ""Leonore"" and ""Der traurige Mönch"", and Viktor Ullmann's ""Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke"", which was apparently composed at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1944 and are spoken readings of poems by Rilke with piano accompaniment. (The booklet has no texts for the pieces on the bonus DVD"
5,Super Flag,My father in law was in the navy during WWII and was thrilled when he opened this flag on his birthday. The party stopped while he made us hang the flag.
5,Navy flag,"Nice,very Nice I hung it under all the ships I was on. And I will fly it on veterans day and other holiday's"
2,Not the original Sha Na Na,"This DVD is very disappointing, I went to their live concert in Radio City in the 80s,and they were much much better then. Members of the group were changed since, songs from this DVD were mostly sang off keys and song selections were especially bad, with an addition of a female singer (or dancer, whatever you call her) only made the group worse. Sound quality and recordings are bad as well."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a collector of ""oldies concerts"" and am a big fan of Sha Na Na, however, I was very disappointed in this DVD.The singing is off key on most songs and the tempo on most is much faster than the originals they are covering.The video and audio quality are good, but this show is just not up to par with the times I have seen Sha Na Na perform in the past.Very disappointing...."
5,Brilliant & Full of Great Memories,"Sha Na Na has been through a lot of personnel changes but each change enhances the quality of the group. I was at this concert &the concert was superb and the video brought back lots of memories. However, the people video taping the two day event, did not do aprofessional job which detracts partially from the video."
1,Most Disappointing,This is not the original group--no Bowzer. The sound is antedeluvian-- Don't waste your money.
3,Sha Na Na - the originals,"This is one of the earlier concerts. Not a whole lot of dancing going on, and no Bouser, but it is still them."
2,Disappointment,Bought 6 boxes to save on shipping. After using up most of it there is my review.These shuttlecocks lack major qualities that one would expect from the brand name:Durability - some break after just a few shots.Consistency - shuttlecocks from the same box could have different speed.Flight pattern - some are spinning and wobbling in the flight while new.Bottom line - you can get MUCH better quality shuttlecocks of training grade than these tournament ones. I know I can.
1,not last long,"just like the first review, this shuttleocks does not last long. It breaks after few shots. But consider you only pay $12.50 for a dozen"
2,inferior feathers,I found the shuttle if smashed a couple times the feather is destroyedit has no durability .....
1,Item ordered -Never received,I never received the item. Address shipped to was incorrect. Shipper did not re-ship item or refund cost.
4,Clever and Thoughtful,"I just picked this pook up for 25 cents at a local used book stores late night shelf. I was very plesantly surprised in reading the book. It was not only clever, but brought up some things about the cold war and our relationship to Russia that I had not thought about before. It was a pretty easy read and exciting the whole way through. Its an older book probably written the year that I was born (of course thats relative), but still it was a nice read."
4,Good Product Wrong Color,I'm giving this only 4 stars because it is actually PINK. It works like it should. Looks good. But I ordered red not pink.
3,Everything ok...Excepto for...Big Mistake!!,"BIG,HUGE MISTAKE ON TRACK 17,ITS NOT THE SONG THAT CLAIMS TO BE,THAT SONG TITLE IS ""La Margarita"", The title ""Florecita"" is another song that its not included here.I actually bought the song,downloaded from this collection and it sounds all right. ""Mysteriously"", a few minutes later when i decided to listen it again, turns out it became ""La Margarita"" again! Whose to blame here? Amazon or else?"
3,ok voice recorder for the price,"I got this to be able to put in my (shirt) pocket and record conversations but it didn't work very well for that. The recording was pretty distorted from the sound of it moving in my pocket. It would be better if it had a pocket clip to keep it still in the pocket but without it, it just slides around and screws up the sound.Also there is a DEFINITE difference in the sound quality between the LP and the HQ recording modes. The LP has a lot of distortion.Other than that the interface is easy enough to understand and it also has a pretty cool ""divide"" message feature. It lets you listen to the message and if you want to cut a message up into small segments you just press the divide button. Handy so you don't have to do it on the PC. I haven't checked out the SW yet as I'll probably be returning it for a model with a pocket clip."
5,Great recorder for school.,"I use it for school and it works great. Easy to use, clear to hear recorded lectures and great to hear notes that I record to study for tests. Also, I am able to put the files onto my iPod and study everywhere I go."
4,works as expected,I just started college so I needed something that I could tape my teachers and keep for later. This works perfect. I download it at the end of the day and it's good till I need it.
3,Sony recorder,I purchased this recorder for the following reasons: l. grad class (Ethnography) 2. to record my newspaper columns before I type them 3. To use in my classroom (middle/high school) 4. to record my grandchildrenGood: inexpensive...sound goodNot-so-good: Once the lid to the batteries comes off-difficult to put back onThere is no on/off switchWorse: Directions are misleading (one does not need the voice-rec. software...) Too many pages of directions...I spend forever reading them and making use of them.FINALLY-my grad school advisor told me how to use it in a couple of steps...
1,"Very good, for all of three weeks","The recorder was everything advertised, very versatile, good sound, user-friendly software, except that it only lasted 3 weeks. At this time, with no apparent reason, the LCD screen simply died. The unit was never mishandled or abused. I do not understand how a company like Sony can package such sophisticated electronics in a totally inferior, uselessly fragile, cheesy plastic chassis. I will not purchase another Sony recorder. Before this one, I owned an Olympus which took all kinds of abuse and was still going strong after 2 years. There is absolutely no excuse for a catastrophic failure of the LCD screen after a few days of light use."
2,Not compatible with Windows 7,This device is incompatible with Windows 7. Sony's lack of concern is disturbing. You can go here for more info:[...]
2,Not outstanding,"+ Has microphone and headphone interface+ Does what it's supposed to do- No ""plug-and-play"" or ""drag-and-drop""; bloaty software is required instead- Doesn't charge up when connected to PC via USB- When you export in high quality mp3 the result is a ludicrous 16kbps- Quick battery drainer- Not a lot of memory- Recording quality is not that great"
2,dismal,"i like Damien Jurado's first two records and was moved by his gentle and simple way of telling a story through a good song; but this album fails to stir any emotion inside of me. the album seems lost and unfocused in a haze of directionless abandon. these tunes sound desperate and play out like unfisnished sketches of songs that any kid with a four-track and a guitar could have put to tape. a few tracks on ""Ghost Of David"" have some worth, but none really merit the puchase of this full length abum. a shame."
3,I disagree,"This really isn't as good as ""Rehearsals for Departure"" or ""Waters Ave S."" The production is very bare bones compared to his last record, and the home recording just doesn't sound very good. When it comes to using a synthesizer ""vibes"" sound you should either use the real instrument or leave it out. Rose Thomas does a nice job singing on the lounge-dirge (can there be such a thing?) ""Parking Lot."" If I'm not mistaken she was in Velour 100 for a time. While I'm not opposed to home recording (my personal favorite would have to be Scotland's Spare Snare) this album has a scrapped together, unfinished feel to it that I don't like. I don't feel much loss or pain- or much of anything- listening to this. Pretty disappointing. It certainly isn't a god-awful record, but if you already have the two aforementioned albums I'd save your money and skip ""Ghost of David."" Even if there is a cute girl on the cover."
5,There is good music out there.,"I heard this CD on our college radio station, and immediately went out to buy it. It brought tears to my eyes. How can meloncholia be so sweet?"
2,intro book,"although an intro book, I did not find this very useful. there are a bunch of tools: volume, indicators etc. but I did not learn anything about how to use that info and actually buy a stock. for the same purpose, check out Intelyze, more expensive, but MUCH better tool."
5,"Wow, What a book !! ..... (Speechless)","What a book by John Murphy. This one is probably the best book I've read. If I have to scale this book's ""greatness"" I would say this one beats my all time favorite fiction book by Tom Clancy , ""Rainbow Six"" . Now when anyone ask 'what is my favorite book' , I'll have to say ""The Visual Investor"" by John Murphy, after all those years saying ""Rainbow Six"" by Tom Clancy. Anyway, what I think is so special about this book is actually that it gives advices and tricks, unlike Steven Achelis' book ""Technical Analysis A to Z"" . Achelis' book is stiffly focused on how to read the indicators and neglect to discuss a further tricks on using them. I have to say, John Murphy also sort of neglect to do so, but not in the greatness of Achelis and for me, I learnt a whole lot of new things and helped me in the 'speculative' world. Read Technical Analysis A to Z by Achellis then read this book. A good combination, just like the weekly Stochastic and the Daily Stochastic."
1,Good book for learning chart interpretation,"Very good, easy to read, clear introduction to interpreting charts. I read this book with some of my own stock charts in hand and found the majority of the discussion in this book applied. I acted on it the next day, dumping my 'poor' stocks, per the chart, and it has literally saved me thousands of dollars.Get a handle on your investing and buy this book. It is not a complete resource for you investing knowlede, but it is a good place to start..."
2,"A short, cheap version of his classic works","This book looks like a short, cheap version of his classic ""Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets"", which I rate as a 5 star book. If you want to learn technical analysis, skip this book, spend a little more money and buy his classic instead, you'll get a deeper understanding (which you will need if you want to survive and prosper...)"
2,Over rated!,"Covers a broad range of topics, but does not get deep enough on any one point to be very helpful! I have to agree with the other (2 star) reviews the book is great for the beginner, but did not provide me with the insight I had been hoping for! I too would agree the book is getting a little out dated. It really pays to read the reviews!"
5,An excellent primer for a budding Chartist !,"Friends,I like this book very much. It has found a permanent (*front*) place on my book-shelf ! This book starts gently and goes on to give more and more details. The CD that comes with this book gets one up-to-speed quite fast. In fact this book was one of the major reasons why I started TA.Regards,- Salil V Gangal"
3,"good book, worst CD","The book is very good, but I felt being cheated with the description about the CD on the back of the book. It says that a free stock charting software included in the CD. Actually, it is a lie. The software in the CD is not operatable at all. It is an automated demo of the Tradestation software and is useless at all. I gave it a low 3 stars because of the CD."
2,Visual Investor - Good Starting Point,"For the novice investor this is a good starting point. It speaks to the beginner trader. It intruduces you to chart analysis, intermarket relationships and Stock and Market trends. However, it is 10 years old and some of the technology discussed is out of date. The basic concepts of oscillators, indicators and trends are solid information. The CD provided did not work in my system and I viewed it as worthless. I think it was created for an operating system well below today's standards. Interesting book and nice starting point for the beginner."
1,A Bad Summary of His Previous Two Excellent Books,"I do not recommend this book for either professionals or beginners. Although Mr. Murphy is a great technician and has written 5-star books (Technical Analysis and Intermarket Technical Analysis) on technical analysis, this is only a very bad summary of his former books. Better buy his other books on the subject."
2,Not much of a mix,"The ingredients are very few. You have to add almost everything. This mix contains only rice flour, potato and corn starches, guar gum and granulated honey. You add ... baking powder, sugar, butter, vegetable shortening, eggs, cider vinegar and off course water. Honestly, this mix only gives you a nice recipe and a few of the ingredients you need. I haven't eaten it yet so I can not give it one star and also they do provide a recipe which a lot of people enjoy in the ratings they write. For me I hope to find an easier mix soon."
5,Best Texture for Crust Lovers,I used these during the Holidays. Out-of-town family couldn't tell the difference until I told them and they were impressed. Used it for Apple pie and Pumpkin. Perfect.
3,Prefer Pamela's,"Was out of Pamela's Bread Mix so picked up a box of this at a health food store. With Pamela's I usually use the basic crust which is two, eight ounce sticks of butter and some water. Held off my rating until I got another package of Pamela's and tried the flaky variant which is one, eight ounce stick of butter and eight ounces of shortening to compare the crusts. GF pantry crust is definitely 'flakier' but not enough difference from Pamela's to sway me. I'll stick to a ""much less ingredient"" mix but will buy more if I ever run out of Pamelas again."
4,GF pie crust mix,"The product was delicious, but a bit hard to work with. Only got 3 crusts out of it but my pie pans are 9"". Made a double crust apple pie and a pumpkin pie. The crust on the pumpkin pie turned out great but the top crust on the apple pie was very crumbly, if that's a word."
5,Love it,I really love this and it is better with each day that you pie lasts. Works well even after being frozen .
4,All right,"It tasted good, but only made 1 pie crust. It had more ingredients than my own home-made pie crust, too, so harder to assemble."
2,Pasty pastry,"I followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre-made GF crusts using a GF flour blend, palm shortening, ice water, salt. The crust looks and feels flaky, but when the fork hits your mouth, it dissolves into a grainy, pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down.I don't know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together, but whatever it is, this mix doesn't have it."
4,Mix crust the day before,"This mix created a lovely, delicate crust that I have used for both sweet and savory pies. I found that it works best if you double the amount of water, mix it the day before you use it, then rehydrate and roll. If you plan on using it the same day, don't, or you will have sand that doesn't roll out. The premixed crust also freezes very well, which is nice since each box really does make 4 single crusts."
4,Kids and Hubby loved!,We haven't had a pie and didn't think we would have been able to since we had to go GFCF earlier this year.Well we had to exchange the butter in this recipe with coconut oil and it was sorta dry were I had to add water a couple tsps at a time n rolling out was a little harder then normal crust BUT it turned out great. Nice and flaky n it didn't take as long even having to mess around with it a bit to make 4 pies. We tried with pumpkin apple and cherry. And just the other night we used a double crust to make a beef potpie YUM!
3,Typical Chilton Manual,Essential book if factory service manual is not handy. Could be more technical but that's the case with all Chilton manuals.
3,Almost there,"Very good generally, but wiring diagrams are not complete and body details are not present. Worth the $$$ though."
5,Many interesting essays,"This 1998 anthology is a collections of essays in honour of John L. Sorenson, author of such excellent texts as ""An ancient American setting for the Book of Mormon"" and co-editor, alongside Melvin J. Thorne, of ""Rediscovering the Book of Mormon: insights you may have missed before.""Without doubt, the best essay in this collection is that of Daniel C. Peterson's discussion of Asherah in the Book of Mormon, showing that the Book of Mormon contains a genuine pre-exilic religious motif that could not have been known in the 19th century, and could not have been fabricated by Joseph Smith nor anyone else in upper New York state in the 1800s.Other essays deal with topics such as 19th century Mormon funeral discourses, the Maori actualisation of the Book of Mormon, and evidence for trans-oceanic contact between the Old and New World."
3,"Good, but a little too mixed","The Flower Kings have shown themselves to be fine musicians with a prog style of their own. This release demonstrates that as well. However, they may have had a little too much time in the studio playing around with every sound programmed into their keyboard. Despite the phenomenal sequence of opening pieces, the latter half of the 1st disc deteriorates quickly into sonic experimentation without direction. After 2-3 minutes of squaking, I find myself either fast forwarding or jumping to the next song. However, they return to some good songwriting on disc 2 with less playing around. If they consolidated these 2 discs into 1 and left out the dabbling, they would have done just fine. If you don't mind sifting through the weak stuff, there is plenty of quality music to be heard."
3,Emerson Lake and Palmer reincarnated,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Church of Your Heart"" on the radio in Memphis, and although I am pretty happy with it overall, I can't help but feel like I'm listening to Emerson Lake and Palmer. Many of the songs are long, thematic processions with emphasis on pipe organs and keyboards. It's like I'm listening to Trilogy all over again!Just as noticeable is how much the singer sounds like the lead for Asia. The drummer also sounds like he was heavily influenced by Asia, because some of the percussions on their songs sound almost identical to tunes from Asia's self-titled album.Although I would take this music over the mindless drivel on the airwaves anyday, I still don't think it's as original as some of the other individuals have described. I give it three stars, because these guys were smart enough to take the best elements of ELP, Asis and even Yes to make an album that, although not original, is pleasant to listen to."
1,More Than a Feeeeeeliiiiiiing!!,"Are you guys kidding! What on earth is progressive about this group, its a bunch of harmonizing lead guitar lines and it sounds like big-hair arena music from the 80's. I know 70's progressive rock, I was THERE and saw all those groups live. This is not the real deal.Forget prog and get hip to the new stuff coming from England like Elbow (who claim Crimson as a main influence) and the sci-fi electronica outfit Goldfrapp."
1,Too many anectdoes; not enough meat!,"To me, this book seems inadequate. The book describes Vic's career, and that's fine: he's an accomplished driver. The pictures are neat, and the older exotics he drove are interesting. It's a neat history describing Porsche's racing heritage.But it offers so little advice on driving, the book feels like a waste for someone who wants to learn performance driving.It's not a driving manual: there's little theory, and sometimes the anectdotes lead nowhere: they don't provide a lesson!And it's not a Porsche manual, in that the author offers very little advice on setting up the kinds of Porsches that entry-level drivers race today.I think you're better off with Bob Bondurant's book, or one of the similar titles."
3,"Long on anecdotes, short on driving information","I, as others, found the book a little too much ""Vic Elford Racing Memoirs"" and too brief on technique and explanation. Each chapter begins with a fairly long anecdote from Vic's racing days and you have to slog through that in order to get to the part where he's talking about you and not himself. It's an interesting read, don't get me wrong -- especially if you drive a Porsche. Just not as much meat as you might be expecting. For that, look at Ross Bentley's series."
3,A decent read,"This is more of a personal memoir than a driving 'handbook'. The title implies one will learn how to drive a Porsche from reading the book. You won't. Nevertheless if you are a track junkie and a fan of Porsches and their history, this is a decent read."
2,Save your money,"This is more of a ""Vic is the greatest driver in the world book"" than a ""How To"" book on high performance driving. If you're looking to read boastful stories about the author then this is the book for you. If, however, you're looking to learn about high performance driving look elsewhere."
5,Vic is the man!,"Informative,with some Porsche specific info and a pleasure to read. Vic adds in bits of personal stories that are entertaining."
1,"Are You Familiar with ""Jumping the Shark?""","If you are, then you should know that M*A*S*H - Season 4 is exactly where the shark was jumped for this series.In Season 4, M*A*S*H goes from being an often riotously funny comedy to a preachy, politically correct (in a time when political correctness did not yet exist), and virtually humourless sit-com.I remember reading a critic (I cannot remember his name at the moment) who referred to the series (after the departure of McClean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers) as becoming, ""Alan Alda's weekly morality play."" I could not have said it better and I could not agree more!If that's your cup of tea, fine. For me, I purchased Seasons 1-3 as soon as they became available. I also have the motion picture DVD and the novel by Richard Hooker. I love them all!However, I have no intention of purchasing the remaining seasons. I get enough political correctness in my every day life in 21st century America."
1,"Still No ""Play All"" Feature",Those dunderheads at FOX did it again - We're 4 seasons into this project and they still won't listen. Please put a play all feature on these DVD's for hellsakes!
5,MASH Fan's Review of season 4,Great if your a fan of the MASH tv series. Introduces two new characters in BJ Honeycutt and Colonel Potter. A must have for all MASH fans.
2,the beginning of the end,"As everyone knows season 4 saw the departure of wayne rogersand mclean stevenson, and the arrival of harry morgan andmike farrell. morgan is not a total disaster replacingstevenson (although I still prefer stevenson) but, mike farrellmay be the least funny actor I've ever seen. I don't everremember laughing at anything he's ever said. The show seemedto turn more to preaching and away from comedy during season4.It stayed like that to the end. stay with seasons 1 to 3."
1,mash fourth season,Was sent this dvd but the first dvd was missing. I have both number 3 disks but no number 1.
3,M*A*S*Hed together!,"MASH season 4 is a mixed bag...some good stories...and then some preachy ones. If you are a fan, you might want torent this before you buy. All the regulars are back...lots more on Klinger, Potter is ok, but he is no Blake!"
5,WHY SO LONG IN BETWEEN???,"MASH is the greatest show in TV history. As a fan, having them on DVD is a dream come true. BUT WHY THE WAIT??? Does FOX really have to release them 6 months apart??? Surely 1 per month or at max 3 months is feasible. Come on guys! I WANT ALL THE SEASONS and I want them NOW!!"
5,Love M*A*S*H!,"I love the Mash Videos and enjoy having them. Our Cable Channel used to carry them, but now not so much. The videos have scenes that don't play on the syndicated version, anyway."
5,M.A.S.H Season 4,MASH is a all time favorite that can be watched over and over.....love it! Was shipped to me faster than they said it would be......very satisfied!!
4,Ahhh Memories!,"I'm one of the die-hards who liked Trapper and Henry better than B.J. and Potter. I suppose that, in my opinion, they were nearer to portraying the insanity of the movie. Potter was more like a real officer than Henry (who was more like the Colonel in the movie) and B.J. lacked the slap-stick of Trapper. Remember, MASH was a stab at the military and was never meant to be taken seriously. Still, this has to rank up there as one of the best series ever produced. Henry Morgan was great, and irreplaceable, in Dragnet; but comes in a distant second to McLean Stevenson (again, this is my opinion) in MASH. Trapper John was such a major part of the movie that it makes no sense to abandon him in the series without so much as a good-bye to Hawkeye (yet they did). Oh well, I'm not a politically-correct person so I guess this shouldn't make sense to me."
4,Just what the doctor ordered.,"Once you get past the liberalism the show is great, an all time classic."
1,The Worst Season of MASH,The Best show ever at least the 1st 3 years it is sad at this point to see this happen why could they have not kept TrapperJohn MacIntyre and Lt.Col Henry Blake that just plain sucks doesn't it.why did you kill him in a plain crash he did not deserve that kind of fate he had a son he never got to seeif your a fan of Mas buy the 1st 3 years and the Last year.Itwas good after season for but not great it was about a 7.5/10
1,"Comedy or Drama, I'm Confused!!","The first three seasons were very funny! After viewing the first DVD, there was some comedy and was fun to watch. After that the last two were more dramatic and serious. My collection of this series will end here and any one who wants the funny stuff go with one of the first three seasons!"
2,Season Four on DVD.,"I have bought all three DVD packs preceding this one, and they are all superb from every technical and artistic angle but thats where my collection will end. For me the show finished with the exit of Henry Blake and I would not want to relive its slow demise with the introduction of tearjerking scripts, less emphasis on comedy and a few excruciating new characters. BJ the family man, Charles the pompous 'straight man' and 'grandad' Col. Potter. From a brash new rule-breaking show to formula-driven banality, it all started with Season Four!"
5,Easy to read,Love the hard cover. It's very easy to read since it is a law book. The chapters are not too long.
5,Toddy Cold Brew System,"This system is so easy to use and makes delicious coffee! I make it up in advance and put it in my fridge (It keeps for two weeks) and then I'm set to make lattes, iced coffees and any other coffee drink my heart desires."
4,Converted,Ran across this coffee maker online as a gmail popup. Had just been diagnosed with GERD. Is the brewing process rather involved? Yes. Do you consume more coffee using this brewing process? Yes. Is it worthy of the effort and additional coffee consumption? Absolutely! Tastes great. No acid burn.
3,Pros & Cons,"Pros: The Toddy makes very smooth coffee. No bitterness or harsh acidity. The process is relatively easy. The daily preparation is also straightforward and you don't have the daily need to clean a filter which is an important time constraint with drip systems.Cons: A pound of coffee doesn't go as far as it would in a regular drip system, so you have to buy more coffee. When we used the recommended ratio of one-third coffee to two-thirds hot water the total number of cups was less. Also, we have a hot water dispenser and when poured over the coffee concentrate the coffee was luke warm. So, we microwave the concentrate and then add the hot water. The coffee is still not as hot as we like. The strength has also been an issue. If you like strong coffee you likely will need to buy a dark roast and up the coffee concentrate ratio to half, which increases your need to buy more coffee.Bottom line: the smoothest coffee around but you'll have to buy more coffee to meet your needs."
5,A Good Brew,"I bought this system because it produces a coffee extract that will not cause heartburn or indigestion and it makes great-tasting coffee. The device is simple to use, though you must plan ahead since it takes 12 hours for 12 ounces of ground coffee to steep in 7 cups of cold water. When the time is up, you simply pull the plug and drain the extract through a filter into the decanter which comes with the system. I store my extract in the refrigerator in clean tea bottles and make coffee using two tablespoons of extract in cup of cold water. Heat in the microwave for 53 seconds and you have coffee. Delicious."
5,The perfect cup of coffee,"I really like the flavor of cold brewed coffee, my coffee toddy removes all the bitterness and I don't have to wait for the brewing to finish. Just a zap in the microwave and out the door."
3,Cheap plastic bucket sucks and will need replacement!!,"I have been using this Toddy maker for 4 yrs (makes great coffee). In that time I have had to buy many filters (I use them 'till they are black and nasty) and have bought the corks twice. My biggest gripe, which I have not seen anyone mention (!!), is the plastic bucket. I am now on my 6th bucket. At about 6-8 months the bottom hole where the cork gets plugged into, a tiny crack always appears jutting out from the hole which destroys the bucket. The bucket should be replaced with glass or metal by the manufacturer but that's how they make their money so BEWARE! I have spent at least $200 on parts over time!!! I have had it! I am going to make a new bucket myself out of an old coffee can or something. Otherwise this makes good coffee and it's really simple. I just wish they had the option to buy a better bucket!!"
1,Tried it Twice,I read the booklet. Got the proper grind and brand.It made me ill for 12 hours following drinking just 4 ounces over ice.I was so disappointed. I am going to dispute this purchase if I do not get the $30.OO credit from Amizon on my credit card bill when it arrives.I am so dissappointed. I guess I will try to sell it in a yard sale.
1,didn't send/didn't return calls/still charged for it,"I don't know why they didn't send me the Toddy (that I'd heard so much good about), but they didn't and they didn't return calls and they still charged me for it. When I would call the cust. serv, who never knew what the hell was going on, she'd say, ""I see the order. I don't know why you didn't get it. I'll have someone call you about it."" They never called.It was July of last year and I was a month away from getting married, so I didn't follow up like I usually would, but I figured eventually it would show up or they'd credit my card. Then I forgot about it, but going through my '07 bills, I stumbled on the cc charge and got agitated all over again.Maybe it's a good product, but if they aren't professional enough to fulfill their offers, you'll never know."
1,Use a French Press,"I tried the Toddy and liked the coffee it makes. However, it is cheap plastic, unstable on the counter and the filters clog too quickly. I purchased a large French press coffee maker and soak the ground coffee in it for 12-24 hours (leave the presser out). Stir it a few times during the day, let it sit for a while, then press it and decant into a pitcher to store in the refrigerator. Just as good coffee, easy to clean up and no filters!"
3,WATCH OUT... MORE EXPENSIVE,The Toddy is a great system. I love the coffee however it is not cheap! I have spent more money brewing coffee by this method then I ever did the normal way. They will claim it's even - but from my experience it is 3x more $$$. I go through around a pound of coffee A WEEK! That once lasted me well over a month. SO BEWARE - good product - does reduce acidity - good results - BUT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE compared to hot brewing. $$$
3,"Nice, but save your money and do it yourself",I bought the Toddy and I'll admit it's nice. But it can sure make a mess and you have to keep buying those filters made from some kind of plastic junk. The Toddy filters got dirty and I started using unbleached paper Melita filters. Then the thin glass Toddy contain cracked. Oh well. Now I make my cold brew in a old glass pitcher. I just use Melita filters and filter holders and strain everything into glass bottles. I toss the coffee grounds - filter and all - out into the compost pile. You don't have to buy this to have cold-brewed coffee. Just read the recipe and do it on your own.
2,Does what it says.,Does what is says. I am just not happy with the way the coffee turned out. It is quite an ordeal just to make it and I never really liked the flavor it produces. I have tried several different brands and just don't like it . You can tell a big difference with this compared to fresh espresso shots and I like fresh much better.
5,Smoothest Coffee In Town!,"As a child I remember my mom using her Toddy to make her coffee concentrate and she swore that it was the smoothest coffee ever. Fast forward to today and I'm now 43 and I have re discovered the Toddy cold brew system. Once I made the first batch, all the memories came flooding back and the great taste and smell of coffee were just as I remember as a child. I hope you enjoy your Toddy."
5,Toddy Cold Brew System,"For people who love coffee and don't like any bitter taste associated with the normal heated processes, this system is for you. No bitterness is developed when the coffee concentrate is made through the cold brew process so the final cup of coffee is exceptionally smoth. You won't be disappointed."
2,Taste is average - not worth the money,"Bought the thing based on reviews here and in major news outletsBought the freshest bag of Starbucks beans I could find (expiration date on back) and followed the instructions. No problems in making it, but it tastes only so-so. A just made cup at Starbucks is better and so is french press.I will try another kind of coffee, but so far I am pretty dissapointed!"
1,Disappointment,"The plug was missing, so I let them know immediately.I wanted to take the unit with me for the winter, but neverheard back, so its still sitting in the box back home.When I get back in April, they will be getting it back!"
2,Not a fan,"While the unit does what it says, I find the flavor to be no where near as good as the coffee I get from my AeroPress. I'm not into cold coffee drinks, I got this unit for the amount of coffee it made."
2,"Bettter than a cheap drip, but not nearly as good as it should be","I'm a coffee snob. I admit it.I love great coffee, no matter the form. I've been known to roast my own, and will drive long distances to visit the shops that I like. I'll also go to great lengths to brew my own cup just right. Of course, I'm also eager to try something new.That said, this was a colossal waste of time and money. It brews weak coffee for the amount of coffee it consumes, and it doesn't even taste as good as properly prepared drip or espresso. Two pots in and I want both my money and my beans back. I'm averaging 2 cups of coffee out of 12 ounces of beans, and even then it's not very tasty nor very caffeinated.If you want great coffee, get a steel mocha pot and make some stovetop espresso. Or, get a really good drip and use a steel or gold filter. Either way, buy whole beans roasted no more than a week prior and grind just before you make coffee.There are ways to make amazing cups of coffee. This isn't one."
4,Easy and Good,"The cold brewing system is really easy to use. It does take about 12 hours to brew, but just do it overnight and then you have enough coffee concentrate for about a week! It makes plenty of coffee and it is pretty good! The reduced acid in the coffee is noticeable as I am a heartburn sufferer. The coffee is smooth, but it does lack boldness that some coffee lovers will want. The brewing container is pretty cheap plastic, otherwise I would rate it a 5."
3,Toddy Review,"Received for Christmas. Overall I like this product. It makes good coffee. The last time I used it, I found that the filter became clogged with the coffee grinds and therefore would not drip properly. Not sure if I used a ""grind"" that was too small. Other than that, it is easy to use."
5,Toddy Maker Cold Brew Coffee Maker,"It's wonderful, I love it. I use it for my morning coffee all week and an occasional ice coffee. I have almost no waste. I'm very glad I bought it."
5,Toddy coffee is the best!,We've been using our Toddy coffee maker for over a year and it's a hit for all our guests. They all want to know how to get their own. We'll never go back to percolated coffee.
2,You don't want or need special equipment for cold-brew coffee!,"I haven't bought this product so I won't comment on it. However, I make cold brew coffee every week and I can tell you that there's no need for a special product.All you need is a jar, a paper coffee filter, and something like a funnel, strainer, or small colander to support the filter. Mix 1/2 pound of ground coffee in 2 cups of water and store in the jar for 12 hours, then pour the slurry through the coffee filter into another jar and you have your cold-brew coffee! Everything goes into the dishwasher, and the filter gets thrown away, so there isn't really a mess to clean up."
4,Delivers as expected,"Other reviewers have described the system and how to make the perfect toddy. The quality is acceptable in this combination of plastic and thin glass. Price is commensurate. It makes the product as expected. A bit work intensive, more coffee grinds used than hot drip process. Delayed gratification for 12 to 16 hours or longer, depending on how concentrated and bold you like your coffee. I shall not give up my espresso maker any time soon."
5,Love the Toddy - what about those bneficial compounds though?,"Switched to cold brew with the Toddy a couple of months ago and LOVE it. Smooth, chocolatey tasting coffee, easy to make. What I'm wondering with all the great news about the beneficial effects of coffee: Do the beneficial compounds (GCSF for instance) release from the beans without the heat? Any speculation or information? I tried to drink a cup of heat brewed the other day and I couldn't manage - too spoiled with the cold brew stuff!"
5,"Super simple product, yet the coffee tastes great!","This coffee brewing system is great! The coffee extract comes out very strong and can be easily made in to hot cup of coffee just by adding hot water and a touch of sugar. This makes it taste smooth, almost like chocolate."
4,Makes great coffee,The Toddy system makes great coffee and does as advertised. I made a nice batch on my first try having never made toddy coffee before (not that its complicated).
5,Easy to use and convenient,"I purchased the Toddy brew system at the suggestion of a friend because I suffer from acid reflux. I have had a difficult time giving up coffee, but know that it aggravates my acid reflux. This has really made a difference, and one preparation of the brew, which is 12 oz of coffee, and 7 cups of water that you cold brew for 12 hours, lasts me about a week and a half. Very easy to use and extremely convenient in the morning. You just use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup then pour boiling water to fill a coffee cup and you are set. Also great for cold coffee. And the taste is so smooth. I'm happy with it!!"
4,toddy is great,"Toddy makes great coffee and it makes life easier to have it around. It's a little flimsy feeling, but the results are great."
5,Great coffee,"I received a Toddy system for Christmas and think it's great. The low acidity makes the coffee easy to drink and I find I enjoy the other flavor components of the coffee that much more.My wife (not a coffee fan) likes the fact that I only brew once or twice a week and it doesn't ""stink up the house"" like the percolator.I'll still use my french press, but the Toddy will become my goto coffee maker."
2,Cold brewed coffee lacks a lot of complex flavors,"The system itself has good intentions and isn't overly cheap, but it is certainly not going to make the complex cup of coffee that a french press or Chemex will.I have never had a problem with the acidity of coffee, and when I tried cold-brewed, it was the bland taste that lacked all the complex flavor notes that drove me away. Maybe for iced coffee - maybe - but not for the add-hot-water-to-concentrate crowd that has cropped up. You are short-changing the complex flavors that only hot water can extract."
3,Weak hotel cofffee,"The coffee-making system isn't bad - it's simple enough and clean-looking setup; but the resulting coffee is a little weak in color and body, like the type of coffee hotels used to serve from big silver urns. You can basically try this method without the toddymaker: soak a pound of ground coffee in 9 cups of cold water for 12 hours, and strain/filter out 6 cups of coffee concentrate to mix with 3 parts hot water. If you like the resulting coffee, get the Toddy System; if not, you've only wasted a pound of coffee."
4,awesome for reducing acid,"We used this to make the iced coffee at the coffee shop where I used to work. You really can store the concentrate for about a week, and there's practically no acidity (great for those of us with reflux). The previous review mentioned that you still get your caffeine - actually you get more. The longer it takes to brew the coffee, the more caffeine there is.I only gave it 4 stars because It's a bit of a pain to pull the plug out of the bottom without spilling any coffee. Overall, however, it's a great product."
5,This thing is great,"If u like cold or hot coffee this is the way to go. after making your coffee, i suggest u put some Vanilla Extract in the pot and let it sit. (a friend goes to mexico and gets the mexican vanilla, says its the best, but i just used what ever i had in cabinet) A friend works for a coffee shop in New Orleans and they say this is 'there' little secret. it can be added to the whole pot or just to a cup. if u put it in the whole mixture use about a teaspoon, or just a splash in ur cup. Enjoy!"
5,Simply the BEST way to enjoy great coffee!!,I have used this system for OVER 20 years!! Simple to use and it produces the best tasting coffee! I am looking to replace my old one as it(the plastic brewer) is cracking from being put in my dishwasher. This will be my 3rd one in a little over 20 years!! Not a bad investment to my way of thinking as I know people that go through coffee makers every year! Practice makes perfect and really if you follow the easy instructions it is the best way to brew coffee!
3,Great Coffee...but is it worth it?,"I have been using this product for almost a year now and while I love the taste of the coffee, it is starting to seem like more trouble than it is worth. First, I've yet to get 10 brews out of a single filter; I'll maybe get 6 - 7, tops. Second, I've had filters, on more than one occassion, that drain so slowly it takes 2 - 3 times as long and when I reach out to customer service they recommend a battery of things to try: boil the filter, freeze it, scrap the filter to try and improve the flow. Sometimes, this works...sometimes. The last time I had a problem with the filter was the morning of this post and it had only been the 3rd brew for that filter.How about improving on the product, Toddy?I should just move to French press, it's essentially the same thing.I had this product at 5 stars, then to 4, and now 3. Almost dropped it to 2."
5,Excellent coffee,"Mine was given as a gift. I made some coffee, mine was left out for 19 hours, I slept in that morning. I found the coffee to be excellent taste, no bitter taste at all. I am very pleased with this gift."
5,solved my acid reflux issue!,"Love coffee, but it hated me. Been using this for years now. No more purple pills!! And I don't have to give up coffee...win win. Smooth and since it has no acid, now I don't have to use sugar to balance it out....bonus dude!!!"
4,Cold coffee brewing system,Love the coffee that this system provides. The filter is the only part I don't like working with. The last brew I must not of gotten it wet enough and it moved during the brewing time which allowed grounds to go into the finished product. I simply used cheese cloth to strain and it still tasted great.
4,"Great coffee, high price","The Toddy makes great coffee, but the system is so simple that it doesn't seem worth the cost. As others have mentioned, the filters are expensive and seem to get clogged fairly easily. Placing a paper filter on top of the Toddy filter drastically improves the flow."
2,Not My Cup of Coffee,"The Toddy System sounded appealing - great tasting low acid coffee available with minimal preparation. So I bought it and attempted several of the methods offered here and the in the manual - using different mixing methods, amount of grounds and time before filtering, in attempting to produce excellent coffee. It never lived up to the hype. Not once did I manage anything close to the quality of coffee that I had hoped. The coffee was generally weak and tasted a bit off. I admit that I like my coffee strong but even the attempt in which I used two cups of Sumatra grounds and left it sitting for 20 hours was weak. Which brings up my last criticism, the Toddy system uses a lot more grounds than I use with my french press. Expensive weak tasting coffee is not for me."
3,Fails where it matters.,"The Toddy brewing system is quite efficient, but I have had several problems with it on the whole:1. The coffee is flat and dull - rather lifeless. I use various Trader Joe's coffees, all of which tasted better hot brewed.2. The acidity does not seem to be reduced in a significant manner. In fact, my stomach problems seem more significant with Toddy coffee than with other methods, such as drip.3. The preparation is arduous. It can be frustrating to mix the grounds with water, though I'm not sure why; it just is.I have used the Toddy Maker for three months now, and I think I'm going back to automatic drip and French press. I would not recommend this system."
1,This is a waste of money; just buy a french press,"I love iced coffee but this is an over-priced piece of garbage. This ""system"" probably costs Toddy 89 cents to manufacture in Vietnam. The glass is not tolerant of hot or cold & they could not even make the effort to attach the handle to the plastic container. This will make your kitchen look like you are still living in the Peace Corps with the shoddy design & materials. The french press that I already had was more functional and looks and feels way better. I wish that I would not have tried out this ""system"".Also, Toddy clearly designed this with the idea of printing more money by selling more overpriced & unnecessary stoppers and filters. The stopper is annoying & makes it difficult to empty the container without getting coffee all over the place.Please save yourself the disappointment & just buy a french press and another glass jar to keep your coffee in-you will be way happier."
5,Darn Good Coffee Made Easy,Not your average cowboy coffee. Great for parties. Make a batch up a head of time and serve piping hot coffee that gets you great feedback from your guests. This coffee does taste better and is really much easier on the tummy. The coffee concentrate from the Toddy shortens the time to making lattes with home barista equipment since all you need to do is steam the milk.
3,They are gouging for the replacement filters,"It's a good system that makes great coffee (although it doesn't get a lot of ""mileage"" out of each pound of coffee, and I don't mind the price of the system.BUT!When I first got the system 3 years ago, replacement filters (and you must have them!) were a bit more than $1 each, if you bought a dozen at a time.Well look at the prices now, and they come, at most, in 4-packs. $3 a piece? Please!:-("
4,Great coffee,A little experimentation is required to get the correct grind if you use your own grinder. Makes very good coffee. Don't forget about your filter when dumping out the used grounds. I forgot about mine and threw it out with the grounds. Good thing the unit comes with two!
4,Good.,I go through more coffee now as I have developed the taste for strong. It is good to know that I am reducing the intake of acid. My roommate really appreciates it as he could not handle the pre-toddy stomach burner.It is also good to prepare a batch and then have minimal clean up ie no coffee machine to clean or grinds to dispose of.
4,Worked Great the First Time,"I just wanted to weigh in for new Toddy or potential Toddy owners. I bought mine, it arrived last night. I was very nervous because of all the tips I read that it might now work for me the first time. It worked GREAT! I let it brew the 12 hours. I followed the tips here about proportion and I had coffee the next morning.I will add the coffee is milder tasting. I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. But, it's not bitter at all! I didn't even take cream in mine. I usually have a lot of cream and a little sugar. This morning, just a little sugar and hot water. I do think I'm using a ratio with less water than recommended, but suspect that will change as I keep using the Toddy.So beginners have no fear! I had no clogged filter. And, I tossed my grounds in my garden.I'll happily update this review after I get some more uses under my belt."
5,Great Coffee,"This coffee ""machine"" produces the smoothest coffee I have ever had. I often brew a little longer than suggested, but you can really taste the flavor of the coffee rather than just the bitterness. I always drink my coffee black, no sugar, and I can't get enough of this coffee. My wife has even reduced the amount of cream and sugar in her cup significantly. I have used self grind and pre-ground coffee, and both kinds work well. There are times I crave the oils and bitterness of a really strong cup, so I use a french press, but for daily coffee, cold or hot, this is the way to go. Anyone that I know that likes coffee gets this recommendation and sometimes as a gift for christmas."
1,This Would Make Tolken Laugh!,I'm going to make this very short.It's BAD!The graiphics are great but come on!Don't be fooled by the flashy look.I'm disapointed.This game would make Tolken laugh.
5,Great Game!!,"I bought this game last (11/12/03) night, and I have to say it's really good. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's work, and this game is a tribute to his book. The cinematic sequences are fantastic, the in-game graphics are superb, and the game play is loads of fun. The music is great (it doesn't sound repetitive like other games), and the voice acting is spot on. I've been waiting for months for this title to be released and I wasn't disappointed. This game is a ""must have"" for any Tolkien fan."
4,"This sword is going up your_ _ _when i'm through with you, -","-Smaug (That finished the title) This is one of the best games i've ever played. The graphics are sweet. (especially right after you get the ring and the wolves surround them around a tree) I read the book and I was so exited when I found out that this was coming out on GCN. My favorite type of video game is action-adventure so I thought that this would be a great game. I was right. This is a really fun and awesome game. It's exactly like I expected it to be. It follows the book extremely well which is what I hoped for because The Hobbit is one of my favorite books. It's also a long and not too easy, un-like some of the games I've played."
3,"eh, ok",there was a small chip on the bottom of the frame but its just not worth going through the hassle of switching it for a new one..
4,"A nice, simple frame","I got these for mounting some prints and was happy overall with the product. My only warning would be to exercise caution when you're removing the glass, I was pretty careful and broke off a little plastic from the corner. It's only visible if you're looking for it, so I'm still quite happy."
4,"Very nice, very slightly damaged","It arrived with one very thin, long, faint scratch on the glass. This had to be a manufacturing problem rather than a damage-in-shipping problem since the scratch was on the inside of the glass. The scratch was fairly obvious against the mostly-black image that the frame is shipped with. However, the scratch was not noticeable when I used the frame for my light-colored photo, so I did not bother to return it. Frame looks very nice and feels sturdy."
3,cheap frame good look.,"My frames came with some shipping damage but I am going to use them anyway. the frame itself is btittle cheap plastic but overall they look good. They do as they should, display your posters."
1,Poor Quality,These frames are of poor quality and do not stand using the punch out holder provided. Would NEVER purchase again.
1,Window too big and more...,"I'm afraid this product is a big disappointment for three reasons. First, even though it states that it is 16""x20"", the visible ""window"" is actually 1/4"" bigger in both directions, which means if you have a 16"" x 20"" picture/poster, there is a 1/4"" of VISIBLE cardboard backing in each direction. Second, there is only one nail/screw hole in each direction, which means if your picture is landscape, you have a 20""-wide picture hanging only by the center point (tilts too easily). There should be one in each corner. Finally, it arrived with a very small hairline crack in the glass. Doesn't seem like enough to mess with returning it, but makes a visible white line on the black border of my poster."
2,All the negative reviews are accurate,"I literally LMAO when the same thing happened to me as all the other negative reviews. When I took the plastic off a corner literally fell off and was snapped without possibility of repair. I did not contact the manufacturer. Fool me once shame on you, I wasnt gonna be fooled twice. Two stars for it actually 87% compacity. My point is across no point continuing on .."
1,Broken! Dangerous! Caused injury while removing it from poor packaging.,"This frame arrived horribly packaged in a huge box, and the glass was completely shattered. As I was getting it out of the box a shard sliced my hand. This seller should be removed from Amazon because their packaging is dangerous to the consumer. The frame was also missing huge chunks of plastic (?) material along the edges. I am incredibly disappointed."
4,Not too flimsy,"I couldnt find a frame this size that wasnt extremely expensive and I didnt want anything particularly special so I got one of these and it was exactly as expected. The ends dont perfectly line up, as usual, but it works for the price."
3,Ok for basic info,It is not the most complete on the 4th gen F-body platform...but it is helpful for some basic info.
3,It works,"This product works but it isn't anything extraordinary considering the cheap build quality. It's a great buy but despite the description it is NOT heavy duty. It is extremely light weight, rigid and tight but it's not something you're gonna want to place anything other than a lightweight point and shoot camera on. If you place a 5D Mark II on it with a 70-200mm 2.8L lens you're likely headed for trouble. Also, the carrying bag is a slither of a pouch and not nearly as pronounced or exaggerated in size as the picture shows and nor is the monopod.However, I will be using it for a light stick for off camera speed light flash guns so it is more than adequate. If the locking mechanisms and grip hold up I may consider purchasing another due to its light weight."
4,Works well overall,"Solid piece of kit for the price. I've used it for about a month and have no major issues, only a few minor ones. The main issue is the rubber foot on the bottom screws in and out to either expose or conceal a steel spike for outdoor use. I screwed it out to cover it to use indoors on a gym floor. By the time I was done (about an hour), the foot loosened and worked itself back in, exposing the spike which was digging in the gym floor. Ooops. I think I might put a drop of loctite on it to see if it helps."
2,"Well, It Worked Great for 5 Months...","I bought this to use with my Canon Rebel XTi. I immediately loved it since it added just a little bit more stability to my photos, which increased their quality, especially for macro and long distance shots. Then five months after I started using it, the metal screw that attaches to the camera broke off with my camera attached while I was walking with the camera and monopod supported on my shoulder. I luckily had the camera strap in my fingers, so I caught my camera before it hit the ground. Now this monopod is going into the trash. I'm definitely going to replace it soon though since my overall experience was positive and I found it to be a very useful tool. I just would like a longer-lasting product. Maybe it's a good idea to invest a little more money for one that is more durable."
1,broke after some light use,This is a cheap piece of equipment and should be trusted only as that.Used it for more than a year but only a 3 or 4 occasions. I'm happy I was only putting the camera in when it broke. As some have reviewed the screw at the top is glue to the base. What is surprising is that the glue didn't give up but the screw itself broke. Bought an Fotopro Carbon Fiber one now and the difference is clear. Spend some extra money and buy a real monopod.
4,Great monopod - but be careful on thread size,"While this monopod appears to be a great buy - it has sturdy construction and is easy to carry around - it unfortunately doesn't fit any of my equipment. I wish the thread size had been listed in the product description (1/4""). So I have returned it (and been refunded) and have a new monopod with 3/8"" thread (CFM 200) on the way."
4,Great inexpensive option.,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this, but for $15 I figured I'd give it a shot. For the price, it's a great buy. Seems sturdy enough, It's very tall when fully opened and it does what it's supposed to. All in all a great buy. I'm sure if you buy a more expensive one, the build quality might be nicer but for what it is, save your money and get one of these."
2,Not *that* steady,"I purchased this monopod mainly to do sports photography. They call it ""heavy duty"" but it really isn't. The snaps are wobbly and when fully extended (with a large lens), seems like the hinges will break at any moment or the metal legs will bend. Also, I don't think mine came with a bag."
4,Monopod,The product quality was much better than expected due to the products low price. Very happy with purchase. I would recomend this product
4,Works great!,"Simple, easy to use, and the price is right! My husband records lots of performances from confined seating and this is definitely the way to go."
5,Great Product Good Value,I wanted a monopod for basic use. This gives me more. The value and quality of this product compares with others I have seen costing sometimes twice as much. It adjusts well and is very easy to use. In its bag its small and light enough not to be a problem. The bag is a bonus as most I looked at do not have one. I use it for both video and still camera shots and its great. I am not a pro but this gives me better shots without the blurs and movement of zoom video and long distant still photo's.
4,Very Happy,I am very happy with this product it is very light and folds down very small also bought Giottos MH-1302 Pro Series II Socket & Ball Head with MH-110C Camera Mount together they hold my Sony Handycam DCR- SR45 just fine. Cant beat it for the price.
5,Just what I wanted!,"The product and price were exactly what we needed--we're not photo pros, just needed a little help keeping the camera steady for casual shots. It's small, light and easily adjustable. Haven't used it long enough to know if the adjustment knobs will stay tight, but everything appears well-made, so we have good expectations. The carrying case makes it easy to keep with the camera gear. Thanks for a handy product at a reasonable price."
5,Excellent Item,This is such an excellent item. It is a great monopod. Wished it had a monopod cap. It has helped to steady my nervous hand. It also doubles as a walking stick and triples as a billy club-though I havent used it as that yet. But I walk alone with my expensive camera and muggers will think twice. When I open it fully up it extends taller than me. A pivoting head would have been nice but for 12 dollars who can complain. It is a writst strap and an excellent carrying case. And I received it on time.
4,Opteka MP100 Monopod,"Very versatile and workable product, works great at all lengths.Great shipping!"
3,"Ok, but...","Foam on hadle was cracked. Small but still cracked. Product description is lacking screw size you need 3/4 adaptar. My own fault as ""assumed"" heavy duty meant 3/4."
5,"Great product, great price!","A few weeks ago I ordered this monopod from 47th Street Camera through Amazon, and I have to say I'm very impressed. First with the shipping. I selected the free shipping option and two days later it had arrived. The rest of my order, which came from Amazon, showed up a little over a week later...so kudos to 47th Street Camera for shipping so fast! The monopod itself is very lightweight, but doesn't feel cheap. I love how it goes from very small and portable, when folded up, to quite tall when fully extended. A nice feature for a taller person. A great monopod, and you can't beat the price."
4,Just What I Needed,It's a great tool to have in my camera bag. The stability of a tripod with less set up! Great for churches and forma settings where tripods are not allowed.
4,a sturdy companion,"A steady hand relieves the necessity of one of these creatures, but who is it that couldn't use a little help sometimes? I don't recommend anything less than a tripod for video work but it got me through a long weekend assignment of candids."
4,Stable & steady,"I purchased this because I like to take pictures at a lot of events I attend. I wanted the stability of a tripod but I didn't want the bulkiness, this is just the handy dandy tool I needed!"
5,Great value very sturdy,I bought this monopod as a combination walking stick for a trip to galapagos and machu picchu. It did seem adequate for hiking but I was very surprised at how tough it actually was. It took me to the top of the mountain and supported me without a dent or bend. I'm not sure if a monopod was necessary because I took great pictures both with and without it. I will say if you want a combo monopod this is a great value.
3,Worth the price,"I like that the monopod is long enough that I don't need to stoop to use it. I'm 6'3"", so that was one of the attributes I looked for. It is well built and light weight. The top swivels horizontally, which is unneeded on a monopod. It would be better if the swivel allowed vertical rotation. I use a vertical swivel from a tripod on mine. Without it, the monopod would be practically useless to me."
4,Fantastic! All but one thing...,"Wow! For the price, you get one hell of a deal.I have not used it a whole lot (as I only received it earlier today) but I will be this upcoming weekend during a family trip to San Diego. This should work A LOT better than a tripod in ""touristy"" areas like the San Diego Zoo and Sea World. We'll see. Hopefully it lives up to the hype that these reviews are leading it to be.However, there is one thing that came as a disappointment. The carrying case. It wasn't the actual case that was the problem, it was the zipper. I tried for a half hour to get it down... IT WOULD NOT BUDGE! I'm sure mine was just a faulty zipper that broke somewhere alone the line. I had to cut the monopod out - destroying the case. But honestly, I don't think I'd use the case anyways... I can just carry it around like the man I was born to be :)It also make for a nice baton in case you need to straighten anybody up.If I could, I'd give this product a 9/10."
1,Poorly constructed and bad customer service.,"Length:: 2:29 MinsA quick, 2:30 video review of the Opteka MP100 67"" monopod highlighting it's good qualities and the really bad problems I had with getting it off of the camera as well as my poor experience with Opteka's customer service."
5,A great buy,"Good quality, particularly for the amazing price. Sturdy, well-made, and even the case is nice. Pops open in a second, collapses just as easily.Keep in mind that fully collapsed it's wider than a standard backpack, so if you lash it under a backpack it will be awkward. But the strap on the carrying case makes it easy to loop the monopod and carry it vertically."
2,Lightweight Use Only,"Okay, for the price, what can one expect? I found that with even a modest load that the top plate had a significant amount of play. I would not use this for any camera/lens combo that was more than two or three pounds.As for the previous reviewer who suggested one never needs more than 67"" of monopod, I beg to differ. It is fair to say that this is a tall monopod, which is why I took a chance on it. But whether it is tall enough depends on how tall you are (I'm 6'5"") and what kind of surface you're standing on. If the surface slopes away from you (on a hill) or you have to use a step below you for resting the foot of the monopod, 67"" may not be enough.For a few dollars more, check out the Bogen/Manfrotto line of aluminum monopods. They are not as small or light (and sometimes not as tall), but they are tough and reliable. If you want a monopod for your point and shoot or an SLR with a modest lens (forget that 80-200 f/2.8), then this one might work for you."
4,Works Great,The zipper on the case was so stiff I could barely move it. I rubbed some candle wax on it and after a few zips it was easy enough to operate. The clamps were a little stiff to operate but I'm sure they will become easier to use. The pod attaches to the camera very easily and once attached the process of taking a sharp picture is very easy. This pod is most useful for cameras that do not have image stabilization! It works for me!
4,Sturdy and inexpensive,"This D/SLR pole stand is great for sporting events, as it is light weight and sturdy. For the price, this is an excellent choice for a monopod."
2,Prelude to Corporate Excess,"The guts of VS were its operations. There is only one sentence in this book about the premier trainig operation in N.Lake Tahoe that turned out some of finest restaurant mgrs around.This book is about a small group of corporate people who partied, had random sex, drove nice cars, etc. The author seems upset that he didn't get a promotion - after reading this me-me book, I can see why. Towards the end, the author becomes a tattle-tale and somehow puts blame on one of VS's founders. It was tough to get through. Not very tasty."
4,joejac,"I ordered this product not knowing the size, because it did not state on the order page. After receiving I was suprised at how big a window decal was for a car or truck. The size is really to big for a car or truck. Also I wish dealers would put for car or truck must be installed on outside of window, also not made for tinted windows. Would like to find a true decal that use to be soaked in hot water before applying to outside of window. I have had several decals of the type sent removed from my vehicle because they peel of easy and can be reinstalled each time. Thank you Joseph Annis Hudson NH, Amazon customer"
1,Lied about what they had for sale,"I ordered a 17 inch laptop computer case. They sent me a 15.4 inch case and stated they never had any 17 inch cases. Yes, they refunded my money, but it cost me $10.48 to return the case and they didn't refund that cost. Won't buy from them again or recommend them."
2,Very disappointing Object-Oriented book,"I thought this book would give revolutionary ideas on how to use object-oriented techniques to help my day-to-day programming life, but I was badly mistaken. There is only a few chapters on actual object-oriented programming but it does not use real world examples. The rest of the book is a badly written explanation of Delphi, which there are several other books which explain it much better."
2,Doesn't live up to its own jazz,"The Jazz has lots of well-constructed future paradims, but somehow Scott has not given them enough of a venue to stand on their own. Yes, the web surfing scenes and technology are very cool and well-written, and there is much detail, but the story reasons for the net escapades are so thin that to keep on reading I had to give up on expecting anything from the story. About 50 pages are devoted to Lizzie's plunge into the seamy District, but for what? She needed to use a phone? The book played like a series of vignettes strung together by the tinnest of plots. If you're looking for both a full-imagined future-tech landscape and well-developed characters and story, read William Gibson or Pat Cadigan (if you can find any of hers)."
3,Not that jazzy,"The premise is classic cyberpunk, but unfortunately Scott stops short of adding anything really new to the genre. Once the protagonist is 'taken down', one is left wondering why the solution hadn't been carried out in the first half of the book or at any one of the mind-numbing locales that the heroin drags us through. Not a bad read, but definitely look to Snow Crash or just about any William Gibson for groundbreaking stories."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Jazz is a more mundane work, if you like, with a setting a little bit closer to our own. Imagine if you take some melding of a crappy show like Entertainment Tonight or that sort of American thing, and it grows, and evolves on the internet to the point where people are obsessed with it all over the place.Programmers and designers have to produce it, and some of them will get their places with criminal or other help, and the criminal types will want their cut."
5,Marcus Rules,"Marcus Schenkenberg is incredibly photogenic, blessed with good height, ruggedly handsome looks and a body which closely resembles a Rodin sculpture.This book should soon find its way into every man and woman's bedroom.The photos are stunning and the articles are awsome."
1,OHMYGOD theres something horrible on the bookshelf !!,i was expecting some great story about the life of a model and its many people and all about it but instead i find some little picture book with this horrible guy who tries to look good but somehow doesnt get it right ???? i only wish that amazon would allow me to give this book zero stars! if you wanna read something sweet and great read that book about GIA and dont you forget about her! i didnt like this book actually i hated it augh ....aughhhhh
3,This is the beginning of it all,"Have you ever wondered where the likes of Soilwork, Opeth, In Flames, Arch Enemy, and Children of Bodom got inspiration. Well, look no further. Some might say that it all began with At the Gates(probably the best band ever). At the Gates was more thrash/ death metal than melodic death metal. This CD was the beginning. The first 9 songs are from the Skydancer album, which was DT debut. These songs re well executed with some very excellent tracks. Others are just filler. The most surprising thing about this album is the vocals. Anders Friden heads up the vocal department(if you've been living in box for the past couple of years, Friden fronts In Flames). The last 4 songs are amazing. Mikael Stanne takes over vocal duties and more than fills Friden's shoes. THe Alone remix is simply a classic. Pick this up if you enjoy well played metal. Classic."
4,First Melodic Death Album,"Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece. Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals. Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time. Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet."
3,The roots of Melodic Death,"This was one of the founding albums, along with Amorphis' Tales From The Thousand Lakes. Although i prefer the latter, this album is still great for those interested in how it all started. Now i'm sort of just getting into melodic death as of a year ago, and i think the sound now is miles ahead of what this is, so i can't appreciate this as much as long-time fans will, since the beauty of it isn't so much in the music itself (the production is weak, the guitars don't crunch and sound thin because of it) but in that it was so original and innovative when it came out. Don't expect a monster like Soilwork's A Predator's Portrait, or like In Flames Jester Race, even though Jester Race wasn't much after this album. Not one of my top albums, (i prefer DT's Gallery Album but quite a bit) still worthwile if you own most of the Melodic Death essentials already. Probably more like 3.5 stars."
4,Too bad it is not on DVD,"A wonderful movie telling the struggles of loved ones, their fears and strengths living in the divided city of Berlin."
1,Item never received from store!!!,I saw the item on amazon and called the company first to make sure they had the desk and could ship quickly. They told me no problem so I ordered it...a month an a half later I still didn't receive it even though I received a notice from amazon that it had been shipped. I called the company and they told me the desk was damaged so it was shipped to them and that they couldn't get another one. But nobody called to tell me any of this and I had to call to make sure to get a refund. I waited almost two months for the desk only to find out I was never going to receive it and I needed it quickly. Terrible company MYOFFICESOURCE.COM...don't buy from them!
2,Don't waste your money,"Garmin really missed a great opportunity with this product. If you are a really new beginner or need a refresher then this DVD might be for you. However, an instructional DVD should provide more. Downloading optional MapSource chart detail is mentioned briefly but no instruction. Instead you are referred to the user manual or the Garmin website. As I said before this was a great waste of money."
1,training dvd,"more than useless. I didn't learn anything I was interested in: use from a Mac platform, how to feed the devicewith infos, what they are and where to find...etc...etc... zero!"
3,"ok i haven't heard this, BUT...",... what the heck are those other 2 reviewers saying? this is not black metal nor does it even remotely sound like black metal. I think they're trying to confuse you. I actually haven't heard this album but if it's angra it's probably pretty good. But trust me there's no way angra could even sound like black metal if they tried. Nor would they want to.
1,A MERIT,"THis CD has a great merit: to possess one of the worst cover arts of all times !!! As for the music, forget i. This band onyl copies another people. Their lead singer, André Matos, has solid knowledge in classical mucis, but in rock he just screams without soul, it's annoying."
1,IT ADDS NOTHING...,"Don't know why ANGRA released this silly Ep, with an absurd cover art that gives inch that the CD was rushed to the market. Andre Matos is a horrible singer, this Brazilian band has no personality, just tries to copy (badly) the European power / symphonic metal bands. Blergh !!"
4,It fit OK but beware,"Seller shipped with no box. They just plastered shipping labels onto the muffler and had Fedex pick it up. Needless to say, it wasn't in ""new"" condition when it showed up. Welds seem a little sloppy also with no post-weld cleanup.It did fit my 1989 CRX and it is quiet."
5,Fixing previous rater's error,The moron before me gave the knife a one star when he meant it for the Amazon service. I am giving a 5 star because this nife is amazing and i need to average out his mess.
1,Delayed in Dallas,"If you want this item by Dec. 24, DO NOT use amazon. I'm a loyal amazon customer who does 90% of Christmas shopping every year exclusively on amazon. I ordered this item Dec. 14, and the final order said ""This item is in stock and will arrive by Dec. 24."" Today, Dec. 18, I check my order and find that now, the item may not even ship until February of next year. Unacceptable.Luckily, my neighborhood Williams-Sonoma has one in stock at a cheaper price.I'm rating the service poorly, not the knife."
4,Dozens of Cat Lovers Talk About Their Cats,"This is a nice book to give to a cat owner. It has 79 pieces about cats, written by a variety of people with the common bond of loving cats. It begins with a poem by T.S. Eliot on the three names that each cat has (and you thought that your cat had only one name). Dave Barry contributes his look at cats. Don Knotts tells us how his cat gets stranded while climbing tall, mesh drapes. You may not have a dry eye after you read Gail Brennan's, ""Ode to Sissy."" There is a judge who keeps his cat in his courtroom for its calming effect during trials. There are stories by pro athletes and by people in all walks of life, each sharing a love of cats. We see Socks (President Clinton's cat), Garfield, and Felix. It's an enjoyable book."
3,"Lovely, except...","These earrings are adorable. Too bad they look nothing like the picture. At all. The earrings I received were domed and had no crystal elements, as opposed to the flat-topped earrings in the picture."
1,not as described,dont you hate when they put a picture up of something they are selling and when you get the item it looks nothing like the picture? this item is not the one in the picture. i bought this cause my strap broke and wanted the replacement. at panisonic they wanted 25 plus shipping for the strap...well I would have been better paying it than falling for the sucker buy on this misadvertised item.cheers!
2,Be Prepared,Item installed in '05 Dodge Ram 1500. It would only work in one not so conveinient spot on the steering wheel. It also will not work if there is direct sunlight on the receiver. BE PREPARED for possible disapointment. I was.
4,"The hit, the joint, the single","If this is a single. It is an incredible single, the main track is solid and the remixes likewise. That having been said, it shares the quality of most singles that, despite its length, it becomes rather monotonous. So I would judge it as a mediocre EP or an excellent single.If anything, you can always just spread the tracks out over several MDs or CD-Rs."
1,Broke in half after fifth or sixth use,"This stone did more or less as it was supposed to while it was in one piece. I baked a few loaves of bread on it at about 450 degrees, probably four or five. Then I baked a couple of pizzas on it (in one session) at 550 and when I went to move it in the oven it was in two pieces, cracked down the middle. Useless. Buy a different one."
2,Broke the second time through,The first time I used this; I loved it. The pizzas turned out great and everyone in my family had their own individualized pizza made just to their liking. I was preheating it the second time through and when I went to take out the first pizza; it was cracked in half. Maybe I just got a bad stone; but I was really disappointed with the longevity of this item. I will definitely order another stone; because I love the flavor of the pizza after being cooked this way; but I will order it from a different manufacturer.
1,Broke after 2nd use,I initially really liked this pizza stone. It was my first stone and it helped me make a few delicious pizzas. Unfortunately after the second use it broke in 2 pieces while in the oven at 500 degrees. Did I get a lemon or is this just a cheap product? Either way I would def spend a little more to get a better quality pizza stone next time.
2,Bad peel,I purchased this Pizza Stone set for my wife. We followed all the instructions concerning the stone. My wife made 4 pizzas for dinner and the first couple came out of the oven just great. While the last pizza was being removed from the oven the peel broke causing the pizza to fall on the floor. I don't know what kind of wood it was made out of but I can tell you that it was a piece of crap! I am going to try to glue it back together but my wife doesn't want to use it again and I can't blame her.The stone works great but I am already looking for a bigger stone and another peal.
2,Pizza peel not the same size as the Pizza Stone!?,"Bought this as a gift for someone and was highly disappointed when it arrived! The pizza peel is WAY too small! Why would you package pizza stone with a peel half the size? Also, the pizza cutter was flimsy and small. Not worth it!"
3,Ok set,Primarily purchased for wood peel and cutter but another stone was fine to have in house also. Was disappointed when it arrived because peel is SO small compared to stone! Cannot get a decent sized pizza on it to put in oven.
2,It lacks durability.,"This pizza stone was a permanant fixture in our oven for about 2 weeks. It turned out some great bread, but it couldn't stand up to a lot and a cast iron pan set on top of it cracked it. On the other hand, it does have a 5 year warranty. And don't expect a perfect baking peel; if you make a lot of bread, you will soon need a replacement. It's thick and kind of sticky, and mine had a respectable crack in it straight out of the box. I'm afraid I can't exactly say how it fares with pizza (I know, I know) but it's not effective at all for bread. However, if you're just buying it to make pizza, for all I know, it may work perfectly."
1,Most Expensive Pizza I've Ever Eaten,"Broke into 3 pieces when I lifted it out of the oven, 2 hours after the first use.The ""manual"" that comes with it suggests that corn meal be scattered over the stone before the oven heats.Result: better turn off the smoke detector!In an economy resembling the days when Bialetti was founded, would this be Mussolini's revenge?And why doesn't Amazon allow 0 star reviews?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This cracked on my second use- completely down the middle and I did not even have the temperature that high. They will NOT let you return it unless it cracks within 30 days (so hopefully you make a lot of pizza the first month to see if it will last). Unfortunately, the second time I made it was after a month and CRACK down the middle- no returns- so I'm stuck with a broken pizza stone. Definitely go for a higher quality item and a company that will stand behind their product."
1,Broke,The thin stone broke on the first pizza bake and the peel is 12 in to the stones 18. Invest in a better stone.
1,"Arrived cracked in half, imagine that",I really wish I would have read the reviews before ordering this product. The packaging seems inadequate for shipping individually. It looked to be a good stone but it was broken. Interesting that I have to give it at least one star. Based on the reviews here and how many arrive broken it deserves less.
2,Lasted a year until we got serious about using high heat,"The first time we used a high temperature (450+) in order to make better pizza, it split in half. Now we need to get serious about high quality pizza stone."
2,"Keep looking, this pizza stone will break sooner than you'd expect","Even with proper pizza stone care, preheating, use, etc. the stone cracked after the fourth pizza cooked. Look for a thicker, higher quality stone, this one will eventually disappoint."
3,Not bad...,"The stone works well, but getting the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven is pretty tough. The slider on tool that comes with it is real small and could only support like a 10 inch pizza, which is fine if you're eating by yourself. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the transition was harder than expected."
4,Great for pizza!,"This is the first, stone and peel I have owned and used, and it is the first time I have made piza. I found them to do the job handily."
4,pizza stone,good product for the price. it also came with a pizza peel. i use that all the time for anything that comes out of the oven. good item.
2,Pizza Stone 4 piece Set by Bialetti,The stone was fine and the handles. The cutter was okay. The only thing that was not good quality was the pizza peel included. It was thin and made of cheap wood. It broke and I only used it once. I would not recommend this as a good buy.Vesta Gibbons 7-26-08
2,size matters,"A 15"" stone, but only a 12"" peel? Um, something's not right here. Maybe you will be better off finding a stone that includes a peel of the same size."
1,"Yeah, it's bad","Here's what I did first day I got this: Put the stone on the lowest rack of my cold oven, then set the oven to 550, and let it fully heat up for 30 minutes. I used the peal that comes with the set, which is not really large enough to hold a good size pizza. So I get the first pizza into the oven, let it bake for 5 minutes, pizza is looking good! I open the oven to check the crust - CRACK! Well, the crack doesn't seem to effect it's ability to bake pizza. I baked a second pizza just after the first, they both came out fine. On top of which, the stone got really burnt, and I doubt I'll ever get it clean, leaving me to worry it will impart a burnt taste to whateve gets baked in there nowThe small peal is a bit of a pain - but cracking on the very first use - even if it is still quite usable - is ridiculous.The product I bought was cheap - and I got what I paid for..."
4,Dogs like them!,"My dachshunds like these pressed rawhide bones a lot .. the only thing I've noticed is that the outer layer seems to come off a little easily.. but the bones last a long time with my dogs and as I mentioned, they enjoy them (and the bones keep them busy!)"
5,Everyone loves Arthur,I am a 1st grade teacher. My class and I always enjoy finding out about Arthur and his friends in the books written by Marc Brown. I especially like Arthur Meets the President. I use this book during the month of February as a literature connection to a theme study of presidents. Not only does this title lend itself to my curriculum but it also has a wonderful storyline dealing with a brother/sister relationship with all its ups and downs.
4,"Medicine, Polara, My Bloody Valentine all here","I bought Snow Gas Bones after hearing one song on a Real Audio channel and reading the reviews here. This album solidly follows in the tradition of Medicine, Polara (first album, available on Amazon used for less than $3--try it if you like Medicine or MBV!), and My Bloody Valentine. Vocal and guitar distortions predominate mixed with some slower vocals. I miss this type of music with the demise of MBV and the older Medicine material."
5,A Wonderful Find,"I was so pleased to find this wonderful adaptation of Giselle on DVD. I was first introduced to this version at about 8 years old, and the memory of this production has stayed with me for over 12 years, as well as helped shape my dancing career. The adaptation of the ballet is a masterpiece, and is beautifully danced, especially by Virginia Johnson. This video is a real find, a great addition to any ballet enthusiasts collection, and a excellent way to introduce ballet to kids, especially African American children."
3,Colora Henna Products,"I switched to henna in order to stop damaging my hair with the mainstream hair colors produced by L'Oreal, Clairol, Revlon, etc. The henna route is a little more messy and time consuming but it gets the job done. For my gray hairs at the temple, I find I have to re process very soon after I have done my whole head. However, I feel compensated by the fact that I am not damaging my hair. I have African American hair and it is very fine."
3,"Nice quality, but no good for Apple Iphone repair","Even the smallest of the torx and philips bits are too large for the Iphone, making it rather less than completely useful."
5,great for fixing laptops,Great for fixing laptops. This is the only screw driver I use for working on laptops. The magnetic heads really help.
5,One of the Best Toolkits!,"Hi All,I am an IT Professional by trade, and I used one of theseBoxer 30 Pcs 4mm Precision Screwdriver Setkits at my first job. The kit was so perfect and had exactly what I needed ALL THE TIME for computer repair (excluding Macintosh computers -- look up ""Torx""Silverhill 20 Piece Tool Kit for Apple Productsfor these!). The kit of screwdriver bits has been bulletproof with regards to the amount and size of the bits, and the quality of this kit. It always seems to have exactly the right size I need for the job!My only complaint was that I just dropped the case and it broke the hinge and the case/lid no longer closes properly (or stays on). So, just don't drop it on any hard surfaces... Other than that, Boxer makes a quality repair toolkit for the IT Professional, and I will be buying my SECOND one of these kits. Yes, it's just that good.Best,-- Morris"
5,Great quality driver set,I used this set for small electronics repair. It's solid and very high-quality. The driver is very comfortable to hold.
2,Cheap metal used in bits,"I purchased this product a few years ago when I needed to change out the hard drive in my Macbook. I needed the size 0 screw bit so I got this set.It worked alright for that initial hard drive swap, but the problem is the bits are too long so they don't get a good snug fit into the screw. What ends up happening is the bits end up getting stripped or your screws get stripped.I was also using the small standard bit and the tip twisted about 30 degrees when I was unscrewing something making it completely unusable.I went to use this set last night to take apart a small digital camera in an effort to clean the sensor. I ended up stripping 2 screws and twisting one of the bits in the process.Very cheaply made. Definitely look elsewhere if you plan on using this for electronics."
4,Tools look great. Box came broken.,Tools look great. Haven't used them yet. The box came broken and that is why i gave them 4 instead of 5 stars
5,Good,Inexpensive; bought for the torq bits. Allowed me to disassemble 2 laptop hard drives no problem.Bits are a little soft though; so not sure how long they will last.
4,good for the money,This is a great set for the money. It is NOT a professional set by any means. Quality is average and it is true that the bits are quite soft and do damage easily. But for the frequency of use this gets for me coupled with the unbeatable price you can't go wrong. Not for everyday use but when you need that weird bit you have it. Maybe you have to buy a new one in a few years- for $13 no biggie.
3,"mediocre, honestly","nice collection of bits but neither adequate for an entire range of precision jobs (especially upon smaller items) nor durable enough to withstand bigger jobs and heavier duty uses (stripped two bits already and i describe myself as relatively careful - and technically inclined enough to review these with some confidence). The old adage is true, you do get what you pay for... if you want a set of nice ""precision"" tools (a la small electronics/security repair), pay more and get WiHa or equivalent."
4,Computer Repair Person,"I'm computer repair hobbyist, who have a strong passion for dissecting all things electronic.Pros:Excellent design of the interchangeable bits, and boxComfortable handle with the rubber layerStrong Magnetic tipCons:Tip of the smaller flat heads bends easily"
3,does NOT HAVE T-1 OR T-2,this set does not have T-1 or T-2 screws heads. Even though when you search T-1 screwdriver this product comes up it d
5,Nice Quality Set,"I bought this set to open up my macbook and upgrade the hard drive to ssd. Works perfectly, great quality"
5,Quality for the price,I needed a screwdriver set to work on my laptop. This product worked great for my needs and was a great buy for the price. I don't use them everyday but when I do need them I haven't had any problems.
5,Useful Set,"I really like this set. All of the modular tips are magnetized, the grip is grippy (you can actually apply some torque with it to remove laptop and hard drive screws), the case has an intuitive lock/latch mechanism.Overall, very nice to use and have."
5,What A Bargain,"For less than 20 bucks and all the times I have used it, this was bargain. I repair desktops, laptops, electronics, etc Has every piece I have ever needed."
5,Exactly what I need for computer repair,"Plenty of size choices for working on both Mac and PC's, desktops or laptops. Good price, too! I've only had a it for a little while, but I feel like the bits are of a good enough quality metal that I won't have to worry about shredding them anytime soon. I like the pommel grip, too, which makes screwing small screws in and out a breeze."
4,great set that gets the job done,used these to get at my dell xps. needed the torx 5 and got that and everything else i'll ever need to work on electronics around the house.quality seems pretty good.
4,Weak Case,"Unfortunately, sat (very lightly) on the case by accident - literally I barely got any pressure and the hinges snapped off. I just rubber-banded it, felt stupid for sitting on it, and moved on. Tools themselves are great though."
4,great,I definitely recommend this tool set. I do not deal with screwdriver a lot but when I need them I need them. This tool set is great for occasional computer/home use needs.
4,Does its job...,Does what it is suppose to do and the magnetized tips are a plus. Like the fact that it comes with many tips compared with other options.
4,Decent,I bought this for two reasons - to replace a cheaper set and for the Torx T5. I used it this morning to open up an 80gb Zune while doing a battery replacement and it worked - screws were unscrewed. I can't complain.
5,Great Deal,This is a very nice tool set. $12.50 is an unbelievable price.I plan on using these for computer repair.
3,Not for serious computer repair,"I bought these tools to remove the screws from a hard drive on a dell notebook. A local computer shop wanted $60 to do the job. The screws are very small phillips head. One of the phillips head tools in this set was small enough, but it couldn't get a good ""bite"" on the screw. I tried one of the small flat head tools. I twisted that tool. So its lost.However, I ended up draw filing the original phillips head tool so that it didn't drop so deep into the screw. That worked! These tools did save me almost $50. I would say they are good for light duty work. Good for a hobbist, but not for a lot of serious work."
2,a little weak,"This set is designed well enough, with the exception of the material used for the bits. The phillips bits are OK, but the straight blade screwdriver bits go helical if you try to put any torque on them. The precision screwdrivers I have used from General have (in general) been much stronger. If you need these for more than casual use, my recommendation is to bite the bullet and pay for a better set."
2,"not much of a deoderant, not effective at all","I love the scent but DO NOT rely on this as a proper deoderant. I even asked my girlfriend to try it, it was not effective for her either. Stay with the cologne."
5,A fantastic set!,"This is the best set I have seen so far. The glass insert makes it easy and quick to change from oil to cheese or chocolate. Clean up couldn't be easier because everything is dishwasher safe. The review states that cheese fondue is best prepared on the stove and then poured into the glass insert, but I have melted it in the glass every time and it has always been perfect."
4,Great fondue pot for grown-ups,"This is a very good fondue pot. It looks great and is well made, sterno cans (the fuel source) have always been easy to find in the grocery store and last quite a while. I've owned it for almost 10 years and used to use it quite often for dinner and parties. Since having children it's gotten less use. I thought fondue would be fun for family dinners but since the pot is so tall the kids have to stand on their chairs to dip. It's also way bigger than I need, for a family of two adults and two kids under age 10 I would prefer one half the size."
3,It chops stuff,"It's an axe...It's small. That's about it.You won't be chopping down trees or anything, but it's a great camping tool to have around."
2,Smaller than expected,"I knew that with a price so low, I couldn't expect too much but when I saw it I was surprised on how small the targets were and how small the whole product is. Looking at the picture, I never taught that the whole part would be at the most 12 inches x 12 inches... I don't know how we will be able to shoot the targets at all since the instruction says to be at least 30 yards from it. Anyway, the size should be written in the product description. My son didn't try it yet, so we'll see."
2,A little grainy,We thought this cookie mix was a little bit grainy tasting. I added some coconut and nuts to it and it tasted a little better but still a little grainy.
4,Good for the price of $1.49,"I managed to find a box at the Frys Grocer for only $1.29. They are usually $5.99. I wanted to try them to see how they compared to my regular choco chip cookies. These were easy to make. I over did it on the butter and didnt realize it till just now. But they are good anyway. Kinda crispy, and I like that. Much better then the under cooker doughie ones at the mall. I would buy them again, if on sale. but I dont think i would pay $5.99 for the mix. But I did nt make the cake. So who knows."
3,Not a big fan of this chocolate chip cake mix,"We thought this cake mix was just okay. I've made it twice and nobody really loved it. Their chocolate cake mix is excellent, but this one just doesn't cut it."
1,Terrible,"Get the Betty Crocker mix; seriously. It is so much better -- and less expenisve -- than this horrible mix. Like another reviewer said, this mix is grainy. It makes horrible, play-doh-like, tasteless cookies. Oh, and the cookies don't rise, and they burn on the bottom. In addition, the ""flour"" is a strange clay color.I was really disappointed, and could barely eat the cookies. No one else would even touch them.The Betty Crocker mix, on the other hand, is delicious, and I can't make cookies fast enough for everyone.One other thing -- don't be fooled like I was -- the Gluten-Free Pantry mix does *not* come with chocolate chips. The Betty Crocker Mix does."
1,Terrible!,"I bought these because we had great luck with another brand of gluten-free cookies and thought these were worth a try also. They were TERRIBLE, so bad in fact that nobody would eat them. I contacted Amazon and they graciously refunded me. I will stick with the original brand from now on, even if these are less expensive."
4,Eyehategod still as sick as ever,"Eyehategod return with a new full-length that doesn't stray far from the territory they pioneered. These New Orleans-based sludge fiends continue to pound out down-tuned feedback-laden riffage from the land of all that is Tony Iommi. The production and execution are somewhat cleaner than past efforts, but those previous offerings were never clean at all. Not for the weak at heart whatsoever."
5,Smiles galore!,"My 13 month old grandson loves the Little Storyteller. It is the first toy he picks up when he comes to my house. He has so much fun spinning the blocks and pressing the buttons, but the best thing about it is the big smile on his face as the stories are told!The toy is certainly well made and is easy for him to handle. It is colorful and has enough buttons and spinning blocks for significant interaction."
4,good book,"I think some were under the impression that this was going to be a ""how-to-guide"" to astral projection. The autor does give some pointers, but this book is primarily tales of his astral experiences. I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
1,Poor facsimile,This books is a mish-mash of techniques taken from other authors (Buhlman and Bruce come to mind). It is as though a stoner friend from college spent a lot of time on the internet and wrote a book about Astral Projection. Save your time and money and forget this one.
3,"Entertaining, episodic, unven in terms of reader sympathy","The chapters are out of order chronologically but they make for a pretty entertaining collections of episodic anecdotes. This structure really makes the reader feel as if the Boz is present talking in a face-to-face encounter. The parts where he describes some of his underhanded tactics is a must for any inspiring dirty player. He vents against teammates, coaches, and press, who persecute him for being himself and an individual. But just when he effectively has the reader's sympathy he'll say he hates John Elway because he looks like a horse. One passage that becomes very ironic is when he says he'll play football until they take him ""off the field on a crane"". His retirement comes almost before the ink dries. Anway looking for an entertaining and quick read with an interest in sport has found the right book. Those looking to identify with the man, embrace his principles, and find his treatment totally unfair will come away a bit frustrated."
4,The Boz:The Man and the Hard Hits,This is a good book about one of the best linebackers in college football in the 1980's. The Boz played for the Oklahoma Sooners and then went to the NFL Seattle Seahawks. This book tells about life in college and on the ball field for Brain Bosworth. This book also tells you about his views on the NCAA.This is a great book for all College Football Fans.
1,Don't buy this!,"If you already have the 45 minutes version keep it! This is a fiasco. Here you will have 45 minutes by Shostakovich, the remaining one hour 45 minutes were ""completed"" by a Polish composer called Kryztof Meyer in the same ""style"", if you want. Pay attention! You are not buying Shostakovich here...Keep your actual version unless you have nothing else at all!Martin Pitchon"
3,Like a bad movie with some really good scenes,"As I was reading through this book I experienced periods of shock and boredom. An interesting combination. The writing at times soars and then at other times feels like a sledgehammer pounding the pavement. The mystery itself was incidental. Sometimes the style reminded me of Brijbasi but not as subtle. Still, I would recommend it if only for the fact so much other stuff out there is so damn trite."
3,How can something so creative end up sort of dull?,"Icelander takes place in a sort of Scandinavia - obsessed alternate reality where there is a separate underground kingdom beneath Iceland. The book and its mystery are quite an interesting and creative concept, but unfortunately I found actually reading the book to be rather dull, and I didn't care greatly what happened to the characters, though I think I would have liked the dead woman, too bad she was dead for most of the book, except in flashbacks. I certainly enjoyed her two-story house. I have a clue as to which character is the author of the footnotes, was I supposed to be able to tell for sure?"
4,Quirky,This was a quirky little tale. It's written in the style of an grown-up Lemony Snicket book. It also brings to mind Joe Meno's The Boy Detective Fails and The Third Policeman. A fun and enjoyable read.
1,This Nostalgia Hurts,"I like campy thing. I like old things. I like silly things. I like nostalgic things. This movies qualifies as all four but I didn't like it.The plot is silly; many plots are silly but yet enjoyable; this one was not. It revolves around time travlers going back to get a copy of the Constitution to try and turn around a failing society. The society needs to be put out of its misery.Lost in Space was a campy, silly and thoroughly enjoyable romp. It brought back fond memories of its era. This one merely makes me shudder and glad that my memories of the era are a bit...hazy."
1,Horrible film!,"This is truly one of the worst films ever made, despite some fun looking back at some staple products of the 70's...like ""Tang,"" ""Pop Rocks,"" ""Pinto cars"" and everything red, white and blue.David Cassidy's performance is truly the low point of the film. (He looks great...but imagine Keith Partridge pretending to ""stage act""...badly).Suprisingly, former teen heartthrob Leif Garrett's performance is the most engaging of the film. He seems to understand comedic acting better than the others.All said..I strongly suggest that if you want to re-live the 70's, go rent or buy ""Forrest Gump"" instead."
5,Great 70's movie! FUNNY!,"I was very fortunate to get the only copy of this video, from my local video store that was going out of business. It had been a few years since I had seen it and I couldn't resist buying it. A must see for any David Cassidy fan, or a fan of the 70's."
5,"Well, now that was a surprise!","I'm sure the director and producers didn't set out to make a ""B"" movie, but in my opinion, they created the classic ""B"" movie. That said, I have to say that by the end of the movie I was laughing out loud and had thoroughly enjoyed myself. Its the best ""B"" movie I've seen in a while, mostly due to the sincere performances, cool and colourful costumes, good music, clever inside jokes and all around fun."
3,It didn't jump out at me,"I expected more earthy, sexy tunes like in the first album. Instead, I got something that barely caught my attention. It functioned just fine as background music, but I found that Joan's voice has become less distinctive than it used to be, and the music was also more bland and smooth."
2,What happened?,"I have waited a long time for Joan to come out with another cd, but this is not even comparable to Relish. This cd lacks the complexity of Relish. With the exception of the last two tracks, it's hard to tell the songs apart. Granted, anything that she does is amazing, the one true difference between Relish and any other album that has come out is the variety of all of the tracks. She has the ability to spark every emotion, and this album is like a strong dose of ridilin in comparison to her other albums. I am very sad. I hope this isn't going to be the first in a long string of ""filler"" albums. I would hate to see the most talented woman since Bonnie Raitt become diluted with popish songs. I wish this could have been a good review."
3,decent effort,"After making us wait 5 years for a followup to ""Relish,"" I was expecting something of the same high caliber. Joan's got the pipes, no doubt, but the music itself on the new CD isn't as layered or interesting -- a couple of the songs are downright boring. Still, there are 2-3 songs that approach the high standard of ""Relish,"" with most of the tunes ranking as OK. Face facts, folks: Joan's a worthy performer, but she's no PJ Harvey."
5,Great album - PERIOD.,"When you have a voice as good as Joan Osborne's, it's rather mind-boggling to blow off any of her CD's - it's just stupid. If you can't appreciate the great arrangements on Righteous Love, then you're probably not a fan of real music. This is a great album. The title track is a fantastic modern-day R&B anthem. ""Grand Illusion"" is wonderfully alliterative. ""Baby Love"" is what Rock'n'Roll really IS. ""Hurricane"" is a funky rocking blues that should get you to feel its catchy beat. Her covers are untouchable. Singing Dylan's ""To Make You Feel My Love"" gives the song more meaning. Gary Wright's ""My Love Is Alive,"" well, comes alive - great updating of 70's funk. Joan is a pillar of integrity, singing and producing music that has some substance - a rare feat in today's sad popular music. Joan should be celebrated. We need more music like this!"
3,Over produced.,"I listen to Joan Osborne for that voice. The growls, the moans, the oh ohs, the my mys, I listen for the Janis Joplin like soul baring. ""Righteous Love"" seems watered down. Her voice is too far back in the mix. The music is well played, competent but somehow soulless. Her ""Early Recordings"" is a better choice, edgier, rawer. I loved ""Relish"". ""Righteous Love"" is OK but I want to hear her soul."
4,How dare she grow & change?!?!?,"I was expecting Relish, part II, and I was initially disappointed. But after a few listens, my mind opened up to what THIS album has to offer. While it's not as raw & emotional as her other work, it is crisp & tight, and in my opinion much more musically intricate than Relish. The lyrics aren't as subtle, but I don't think she was trying to be. I can dance to this music, which was something I didn't expect. This is an album that is best enjoyed by listening to what IT has to offer, not straining to hear echoes of Relish."
5,Joanie Gets Nasty,"I love Joan Osborne and I loved this album. The songs are fresh and well paced. My favorite is her cover of My Love is Alive. Stevie Windwood, move over, she took this one away from you. Her voice is clear, yet thick as honey. She moves each song along at a perfect sultry pace. I listened to this CD every night for a week and then had to get out the old ones and listen to them too. If you like the blues, or if you like music, or if you just like anything, you MUST have this CD for your collection!"
4,A Strong and Vulnerable CD,"I love this CD! It captures the whole spectrum of thoughts and feelings involved in relationships with other people (romantic and otherwise) and is entirely fun to listen to. One minute she'll be singing ""I've never been so sure of love"" and then a few songs later she'll sing ""I recall the moment when you ruined me for other men."" Lyrically, it runs the gamut.Musically, this song is very polished--which to me was actually a bit of a disappointment. Relish was much more raw and different from other stuff that was out there. But with Righteous Love, although it is a really really great CD, sounds very professional; and to me, that is where it loses some of its appeal."
3,Someone please pass the Relish,"As someone who also waited a long time for this release, I was disappointed to find that the raw passion in her voice and songs was missing from this cd. I only hope that if there is a 3rd it will recapture some of the magic of ""Relish."""
3,Eclectic Mix,"Ever since her excellent EARLY RECORDINGS release, Joan's gone off on all kinds of experimental directions, & she continues to do so here. Styles & influences vary, ranging from a strong Beatles vibe on the bouncy ""Grand Illusion"" as well as on the ballad ""Poison Apples"", to an Middle-eastern flavor on ""If I Was Your Man"". She tries country on Bob Dylan's ""Make You Feel My Love"" (You may be familiar with Garth Brooks' version), & ""Baby Love"" has B52's written all over it. Personally, my favorites are the title track (a 60's-style ""power ballad""), the blues-rocker ""Hurricane"", & the catchy funk of both ""Safety In Numbers"" & the Gary Wright cover ""Love Is Alive""."
2,Not terribly helpful,"I've read several books on the subject of recovering from divorce, and ordered this because someone recommended it to me. It was the least helpful of the ones I have read, and feels very 1970's... love and let love, no need to feel guilt, be happy and life will turn out alright, it did for the author... Basically, the best point is that it doesn't help to hold grudges. If it sounds interesting to you, check it out of the library."
4,50 Ways to Love your Leaver,"I read this book a year after my husband and I divorced. I liked this book very much because it is written from a man's perspective. The author deals openly with the sadness of lossing his partner and the journey he embarks towards his recuperation. It is a book to go back to for similar references and definitely for 'getting on with your life after the break-up'. It helps you to understand all the different stages of grieving, understanding, accepting, forgiving and healing you go through during this process. It also begins and ends with a 'tongue-in-cheek humor' of the Simon song about relationship loss. Great buy!"
1,EMI Mistake,"I agree entirely with the Ashby review of this product. After looking for a long time for a CD version of the wonderful EMI stereo Karajan Tchaikovsky ballet suites, I found this CD release claiming to be the real 1959 stereo recordings. But, as Mr. Ashby points out, this release is not the real thing, but the already issued older mono recordings. While I do think a great many of Karajan's best recordings were his earlier mono EMI productions (such as the Cosi fan Tutte), in this case, I think the stereo ballet recordings are far superior to the earlier versions.I wrote to EMI about the problem, but apparently they don't care."
3,war stories,"Not a bad book, it's pretty much a bunch of war stories told by a guy who was on the front line of the DEA's war on drugs. Don't expect to hear anything earthshattering from this book, although the amount of drugs confiscated is impressive for the 70's and 80's, it's not really mind boggling for 2005. Go to the library and borrow this book if it's your cup of tea."
5,Delicious,"This series of fragrances from molinard are great, very masculine, nice bottles , look like porcelain, and the price is unbelievable"
4,Imaginative!,"What more can I say about Richard H Kirk other than that he is a genius! This is one of his best albums to date.Combining african rhythms, chanting, ambient soundscapes, Indian rhythms, you name it, Kirk has it!This album has a real 'movie' feel about it, like it was meant as in interpretation of some of his favourite films or as an alternative soundtrack.This is an album you can put on and lay back and imagine to. It is very much in the style of Kirk's Sandoz project, though a bit rougher and less melodic.For fans of Kirk this is a nice change of direction for the Sheffield master, for new fans, well if you like electronic musci and you don't have an album by one of the scenes' main originals then you could do a lot worse than start here."
1,Lower quality than expected,"The winslow bombe I purchased through Amazon was a lower quality than I expected. The supplier was very nice and offered me the option of returning the item. Although it was a lower quality than I would have purchased if I had seen it in advance, it will work for my purpose. It doesn't appear to have any hardwood on it except maybe the legs."
1,STRAP BROKE ON THE FIRST DAY,"Bought it for fun, to look like a friend of mine was my driver. The back strap that expands broke on the first day. cheap made. obviously for the price."
3,Chauffeur Hat,The hat itself is made very well. It is good quality. The packaging of the hat needs to be fixed. The hat was placed in a box with no support for the bill of the hat. The bill of the hat took a different shape than the way it was supposed to look. This made the bill of the hat look bad.
3,Ok,I bought these to as a fun gag to pick up my girlfriend from the airport. The quality is ok. It would have gotten a 4 star but they had the serial number sticker on the bill of the cap and it just left a mark after I removed the sticker. I couldn't get off the outline of the sticker. Otherwise the adjustable strap is a plus as well.
1,Not what I ordered,I received a police hat and not a chauffeur hat. Tis was not what I ordered and I have no use for a police hat.
4,fine,"a coworkers son drove us around one night and I bought this for him to wear (he has a good sense of humor and enjoyed it). The hat is cheap and isn't afraid to let you know it. However, it's adjustable, it fit and it served it's purpose. It arrived quickly and well packaged."
4,Can't help it,"Sorry,but I couldn't help it...I laughed SO hard my sides hurt. I know,I know...NOT great cinema,NOT Oscar material, BUT FUN...I loved it,so shoot me!"
1,Good actors acting poorly.,"When this movie hit the theaters, I wanted to see it because the trailer looked kind of funny. Since I only purchase and do not rent movies, I thought I'd give this a go. Boy was I disappointed!The acting was very poor (perhaps it had a lot to do with a poorly written movie)...I mean, very, very poor! It had it's sporadic moments of laughs, but it just didn't keep my attention. Believe me, you don't want to see this movie because it will taint your image of these actors! You don't want to buy this movie because you can spend it on a movie that is worthy of your hard earned cash! And you particularly don't want to see this movie because you will never get those precious two hours back!You've been warned, Please...stay away from this movie!"
1,What a disapointment.,"This movie is a real lousy story, with a bad script to boot, what fine actors are doing in this piece of junk and degrading themselves is a mistery of poor judgement!"
2,Lame,"Well, we saw a preview for this movie and it looked hilarious. As it turns out, the previews contained the only ""laugh out loud"" moments in the picture. Aside from those few (and far between) chuckles, the story plods along with a pretty predictable plot line. The characters (especially Ray Liotta) are pretty synthetic. This is an okay rent. We are just sorry we wasted the money buying this movie."
4,Wild Hogs gets 4 snorts...,"Wild hogs was a really fun movie, especially for those men that are experiencing the old mid-life crisis. The cast of characters were great together and the story line was one that I am sure a lot of people have considered as they start getting to the ""mid-life"". I enjoyed the film and though it may not be the greatest movie that I have ever seen, it is well worth the price to at least rent, and as I believe I will view it more than once, I just plain bought it."
2,Unimaginatively amusing,"From the trailers we thought this would be really funny, but it is so predictable that we wouldn't watch it again. There are a few spots where you laugh out loud but for the most part it is disappointing. Rent it maybe but don't waste your money to buy it."
3,disappointed,"john travolta underplayed his character. biker bunch had too much dialogue and their menacing struts disracted from the main plot line, 4 guys putting their lives into context. the 4 main characters needed more scenes interacting with more of the world around them. great idea for a film but not up to the talent of the great cast.as to item number 4; i am 75 years old."
3,What You Would Expect,"This is a movie for people who ride Harleys, or any motorcycle I suppose. I don't ride motorcycles, but still enjoied the show. The cast delivers a solid performance in what is a predictable, but fun story. The most memorable aspect of the movie was how old (and chubby)John Tavolta, Tim Allen, Bill Macy, and Martin Lawrence have become!! They still do a good job delivering the expected lines on marraige, work, kids, and middle age."
5,Very funny.,This movie is better than I thought it would be. This cast of characters are a great fit and a laugh out loud movie that will have you rolling.
4,FUNNY AND FUN,GREAT TO SEE SO MANY STARS FROM DIFFERENT GENRES HAVING SUCH FUN MAKING A FUNNY MOVIE FOR US. THANK YOU!
3,does cute go with bikers?,"It shouldn't. But this is cute. Not much more. A couple of laughs, the biggest during the credits. I avoided seeing this on a plane because of the many cuts I expected. I should not have waited. This is Disney after all."
3,Had high hopes,"With the people in this movie, I thought it was going to be an absolute scream. I was disappointed in John Travolta's acting. Tim Allen had some good moments. In my opinion, William H. Macy stole this movie. He was great. The funniest thing though was the end with the whole extreme makeover thing! It was hilarious. All in all though, not enough laughs for me, I think it could have been done better. Don't really blame the actors for all of it, the writers had a lot to do with it."
1,Styled Hogs,There's only one word for this movie: lame. All of the characters are two-dimensional stereotypes of various kinds of people. All of the attempts a humor are adolescent and churlish. You might enjoy this movie if you're a 14-year old boy or if you have an IQ of 40.
5,Wild Hogs,"If you are wondering what to do with yourself when you reach middle age, use this movie as a guide. Soooooo Funny! It's even funnier if you happen to be like me and own a Harley.....Recommend to anyone that needs a laugh!"
4,Wild Hogs,"I had Heard about this movie , and did not have a chance to see it at the theater . So I waited for it to come out on DVD . I just had a chance to purches this , and my wife and I watched it , and really enjoyed it . For anyone over the age of forty , could really relate to the four men in the movie . It really is a must see...."
4,Wild Hogs,"Good for a laugh, men or women. Great combination of actors. Play well against each others comedy. Highly recommend."
2,Rent it - don't buy it,"This is a moderately funny movie, with many cliches, that will waste space on your DVD shelf. Thinking again - it would have even been better to wait for it to show up on Showtime or HBO. Unfortunately I am stuck with the BluRay version."
2,Rather have gone to the dentist,I thought this movie would of been good considering the cast but i was mistaken. It would probibly be good to watch if you either have a small child or your going though a midlife crisis of your own.
2,Boring..........,"When renting this movie, i expected to be laughing the whole time but to my surprise i was extremly bored. By the middle of the movie i fell asleep because the storyline of the movie was very weak and the comedians in the movie weren't shining at all. I was very disappointed and would've been upset if i actually purchased the movie to own."
1,WildHogs,"I read the names of the actors playing the parts and assumed that it would be ""really great""; however, I was disappointed. The stunts were NOT funny and the story NOT funny, if story there was. I believe that with a better written script these actors could have pulled off a really cute scenario. Additionally, it is not necessary to be so explicit in this comedy. ""We get it!"""
2,Waste Of Time,"All the funny parts were shown in previews. The movie is dumb. Its a waste of talent and a waste of time watching. What a shame.For the first time ever, not even the outtakes were funny."
1,yay.more of the same.,"originality,especially in comedies these days,is dishearteningly rare, unfortunately.this was such a conventional lump of doofy humor....words can't express it.the only function this movie has is to furthar the decay of cinema as an art."
3,HARMLESS FUN! THIS MOVIE GOT A BUM RAP FROM CRITICS!,"OK, I was really skeptical going into this film but, good reviews from my Amazon friends Geri and Jenny made me give it a chance. This film is not going to win any Oscars but, I don't think it was trying. This is an entertaining and easy to watch film with good performances by a lot of well known stars. It's a nice family film that isn't too sappy or corny. This film took a beating by critics and I say you reviewers need to loosen your belt buckles and take your shoes off sometimes! How can you be so mean to such a well meaning film? It's certainly worth a watch or two. It's not too ""wild"" but, it's stars like to ""hog"" the screen! LOL! whatever that means!?........I need a vacation!"
3,"Had Possibilities, Fell Short","Great cast, funny lines, lame plot that could have been something...Kept waiting for it to get better."
2,don't take it too seriously,"The cast is great, and it's probably what saves the movie. The rest is.... well, just sit down and enjoy a movie that is full of predictability. It's ironic, but it's irony is based on loser's jokes: why is being a loser funny? There were plenty of opportunities to make this story more memorable (Thelma and Luise comes to mind) and they wasted this opportunity with cookie-cutter characters with limited depth, high-school kids stereotypes, and loser's irony."
3,Travolta is still on top!!!,Travolta is still on top!!!! All I can say is...THIS MOVIE IS ONE FUNNY RIDE! With all the terrible things going on in the news and you can feel yourself slipping into a continuous bad mood...this movie will give you a very funny reprieve. It is worth the price of admission!
1,the reason,"every 15 seconds, there is a brain injury in the united states. by the time someone finishes this movie, they will have suffered 400 brain injuries. seriously.I am now stupiderer because i saw this movie."
1,Men-A-Pause?,"What are all these great stars doing in this lousy movie! It's sort of a Home Alone flick on bikes for middle aged men! Unrealistic situations, ridiculous dialogue, terrible director.....yuck! In spite of all that none of the stars get the blame. They did all they could. I blame the people who financed this contrived mess and the director.....especially the director! Only Ray Liotta comes out (again) stealing every scene he's in. The rest I just feel bad for. Even though they are all millionaires and distinguished actors and actresses this one will have them hiding in shame from their Country Club friends! Embarrassing for everyone involved."
4,Wild Hogs,"Great movie! William H. Macy was the best choice of actors to play his character. Good job! A light hearted, funny, feel good movie!"
1,What a disappointment!,"I just love all the stars of this movie, but just couldn't finish watching it! Ithought it was awful! Terribly boring! I think I immediately gave it to the Goodwill!! Sorry I thought I had to have it!!"
2,formulic Hollywood script...,"it's all in the script! Good actors can take a bad script and make something out of it and that's what seems to happen here. There were a few genuine laughs we had from this film but all in all it was a bit disappointing. I was hoping it would be better then the standard Hollywood formulic script. With talent like this William Macy, Travolta, Tim Allen, Ray Liotta, Lawrence Martin and Academy Award Winner Marisa Tomei you expect more but too often the actors instead of working off of each other in a nice ensemble seem to be trying to outdoing each other and the whole thing just falls flat."
2,Hmmmmmm,Want to see a movie about a group of middle aged guys coming to terms with their life? then stay away from this movie and rent the first City Slickers.Then you'll know what this film was trying to accomplish.
2,Only good for a couple of laughs,"Best one-word description of this movie? Predictable! Cute, sometimes funny, but drawn-out, not the greatest acting or writing."
2,A couple of funny parts,Other than a couple of parts in this entire movie there really wasn't anything funny about it. Don't waste your time on this one. I would say if you're forced to watch it just start watching when the credits start up. They do something funny there.
1,Watch the trailer!,"Because the trailer actually gives you all the funny scenes from the movie. Not some, not the best, literally all. Even more so, the trailer is funnier than the final movie since some of the dialogues are different in the movie. Other scenes didn't even make it. ((""I gotta work on the fist-tapping-thing.- No you gotta work on the bike-riding-thing.)The rest ist just standard procedure, at best and other than that it's just boring and predictable. Not even Liotta and McGinley can save anything here."
3,Wild Hogs,"The Wild Hogs is a motorcycle gang made up of four middle-aged men. Doug (Allen) is a dentist. Woody (Travolta) is unemployed. Bobby (Lawrence) is a sewage engineer. Dudley (Macy) is a computer engineer. They embark on a road trip to put some excitement into their lives. Along the way, they run into the Del Fuegos, a real motorcycle gang, and barely manage to survive the encounter. They seek refuge in Madrid, where Dudley meets Maggie (Tomei) and takes a liking to her. Meanwhile, the Del Fuegos find out where the Hogs are, and come looking for them.""Wild Hogs"" is an uneven movie that has some good moments, but they are balanced out by some unfunny ones. Most of the major laughs can be seen in the previews, and that is never a good sign. The four leads have a camaraderie that is believeable, and that is perhaps what saves the movie in the end. This is by no means the best movie for any of them, but there is enough here that many will enjoy it. I recommend waiting for the DVD."
1,Waste of time,This movie is not what I expected. It has a very talented cast but it fails to deliver.
1,Dreadful just dreadful,"It's one of those movies where you have to ask, ""Didn't anybody preview this movie before they released it?"" It's just dreadful, dull, boring, amateurish. Watch City Slickers if you want to see an intelligent and funny movie about a bunch of middle-age guys seeking an adventure of their life. Save yourself and stay away from horrible movie.Your trusted reviewer, as always."
3,Funny Movie... Offensive Content,"So, granted, this film is pretty funny. The cast is great, the story is fun, the director did a good job, and the various skits and funny scenes are very funny. So, usually, this is a cut and dry four star for me, but I really need to dock a star from this film because of the constant language, gay innuendo, and sexual humor. I really wish this film had been done more tastefully, because it could have been awesome."
2,Wild Boars,"This was probably one of the worst movies I've watched in a while. This was supposed to be city slickers on Harleys, but what they ended up with was poor performances, mediocre comedy, the most basic of plots, and very little in the way of Hogs.Boring sums this one up."
1,Not funny and not a family film,"With the likes of Allen, Travolta, Macy and Tomei, my husband and I expected a much better movie than what we ended up watching. At least it had a plot, but we hardly even chuckled at any of the so-called humor, which was of the junior-high boy's locker room variety at best. That type of humor, combined with language and male nudity, should have given the movie an R rating, not a PG-13. Thankfully, we only wasted $4 renting it and not $12-18 at the movie theatre. Don't waste your time with this one. (Unless, of course, you like the kind of movie I just described.)"
5,Funniest movie I've seen in a while...,"...oh man this is one funny movie from beginning to end. It is about a group of four middle aged men who decide to take a road trip on motorcycles and be free. Somewhere in between they make a bike gang, the Fuegos pretty upset, and the Fuegos begin to track them down. Hilarious movie from beginning to end. Blue-Ray presentation is amazing (I was watching it in 1080i). This is a definitive for your growing BlueRay collection. A must!"
3,it has moments of hilarity which make ir worth watching,"As you watch this film you realize you've seen the plot lines in many other movies; however, this doesn't take away from some of the funniest moments I've seen in a comedy in a long while. Give it at least one viewing if you want to laugh out loud more than once."
3,Wild Hogs,"All-in-all an enjoyable movie with a lot of slapstick yuck-yuck humor. The cast clicked well; you can tell they really had fun shooting this movie together. Ray Liotta (as always) stands out in his small, but memorable role. I gave this movie 3 stars only because I'm a harsh critic, and it is not a movie I would watch over & over again. However, it is enjoyable for the first time viewer."
4,Wild Hogs,"Everyone needs a clean, decent laugh these days. And this movie will provide that opportunity."
3,"OK movie, but not very funny.","I did not find this movie that funny as others did. It was ok, but it would be better as a rental than a purchase."
4,Wild Hogs (Blu Ray),This purchase wasn't for me but my GF loved it. She loves the movie and buying it cheap on Blu Ray was perfect for her.Blu Ray def makes movies so much clearer and the way they should be watched.I don't know all the tech aspects of Blu Ray and how they are encoded but this Disc had great graphics and great colors.Might as well buy Blu Ray. I only gave it a 4 because the movie is good but not one I want for myself.
4,"Fun, easy to watch movie with some cool life lessons.","This movie is very enjoyable. It has a good mix of humor and life lessons. Live life to the fullest, don't be afraid to dance no matter how you look and be the first to slap the bull are just a few of them. Well worth teh time/money investment."
5,Wild Hogs...,"I thought this was one of the best movies I have seen. I laughed out loud the entire time I was in my seat. You have to be a ""Wild Hog"" to relate to the movie!! This movie was very, very funny even though it did get panned! It is the best I have seen yet!!"
1,wild hogs,"I'M EMBARRASSED .EMBARRASSED FOR EVERYONE IN THIS MOVIE. WASENT THERE A SCRIPT TO LOOK AT PRIOR TO SIGING ON TO PREFORM IN THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.SILLY ME, IF THERE WAS A SCRIPT PERHAPS IT WOULDN'T HAVE STUNK SO BAD.THIS MUST HAVE BEEN HOW IT WAS PITCHED TO THE STUDIO-- WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX "" STARS'' WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR A FEW BUCKS,WE HAVE TWO OR THREE MARGINALLY HUMOROUS CLIPS TO USE FOR TRAILERS. THE PUBLIC WILL NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WOULD PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING.NO HUMOR (THIS SAVES A FEW $-WE DONT HAVE TO HIRE WRITERS) WELL JUST TAKE THEM OUT AND WING IT.WE'LL MAKE MILLIONS! EVERYONE IN THIS MOVIE HAD TO KNOW THIS THING STUNK. KNEW THIS WAS A RIP OFF OF THE PUBLIC AND THAY SHOULD BE ASHAMED. AND TO THINK HOLLYWOOD WONDERS WHY NO ONE GO'S TO THE MOVIES"
5,I love it when a DVD set comes together!,"I am so happy I bought it. It's fantastic. Each season is in it's own regular sized DVD case so you don't have to keep it in the van, which is good 'cause the van is pretty huge. They got rid of the crappy double sided discs and they're now single sided ones. I was very pleasantly surprised with it. It's a quality product and I highly recommend if you want the show and don't have it yet. Right now, amazon has it listed for 89.99, which is less than 20 a season. Good price considering the old releases are over 30 a piece. Great show, great product, and it's looking beautiful on my TV as I write this."
4,A wink and a nod,"I couldn't pass this up when I saw it a as Gold Box special. It's not classic TV but pretty close and was fun & funny to watch. The A-Team is like watching a live action cartoon of Mission Impossible. It never took itself too serious, it even appeared that George Peppard acted as if he were in on the joke -the black gloves???. The team always triumphed over the most impossible and improbable plots as one canny viewer noted on the late great website Jump The Shark, ""they could take scrap metal, a paper clip and a wad of snot and make a tank"". That pretty much sums up the A-Team. Suspend your sense of reality and enjoy, Hannibal, Face, Murdock and BA. Better than the recent movie and a fun alternative when there's nothing on TV."
5,The A Team Complete Series,Great Product! Love the case (the Team van). Two day delivery was received next day. Highly recommend.
3,Subtitles not all Francais and Spanish,"Hi, i buyed this but appears in the description: Subtitles: English, Spanish, Francais and really only 1 season give this, the others is only English, they not contais subtitles in spanish and francaise :("
1,Do NOT bother,"I thought products offered by Oregon Scientific were reliable and user friendly. This product is confusing ... The back control buttons are rubber and not at all intuitive. Furthermore, I paid full price way back when and not the clock is no longer working. IF you have been seeing these items for a while you will see that the price has been dropping precipitously over the last few months. This tells me that the amount of returns on the products are high. The ""upgraded"" radio model is not better. I also have the small one. At worst I will call these Papa Junck, Momma Junck and Baby Junck...I have rarely found NOTHING nice to say about a product so I will conclude that at least the amber display was pleasing to the eye when it worked..."
3,The best of Johnny Depp,"I would recommend the book Johnny Depp, because if you like Johnny Depp this tells you all about his career. I wouldn't say it's the best because it does not tell you about his personal life or anything about him, except when he filmed in his movies.And what movies he filmed in, and that his idol and who helped him start a career and his friends.Nicole H."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting much more out of this 2 volume set. The books are full of mistakes, especially in formulas. If you plan on purchasing these books, make sure to download and print out the errata as well. It could save many headaches in trying to understand formulas that don't agree with the accompanying explanation. I don't doubt that Glassner is a very intelligent man, but his descriptions are somewhat dense and difficult to decypher sometimes. My recommendation: get an ACM SIGGRAPH membership to get access to many of the papers in this field and get the algorithms straight from the source."
3,Pretty tight Underground!! 3.5 stars,I was looking around to find something interesting to pick up. And I saw Pop the brown hornet. I was like ok!! he is from the Wu. I just recently pick up Cappadonna and I was hoping that this album was atleast better than his. When I heard the album I was like ok!! it got some tight tracks up there. If u like underground music this album will not disappoint you. It is nothing like Cappadonna new joint!!!
5,"Wow, He Needs Promotion.","How come this album didn't get any kind of exposure? There are plenty of Underground Cats that do get exposure, and Pop should have been one of them. It looks like from the time he was with GP Wu till this album came out, he polished up his skills. I'm not saying on GP's album he was bad. He was pretty good. But on this album, damn, he's spitting fire. The only complaints I have is the songs Stand Up and Hold Ground are some wack songs. Hold Ground has the most corniest chorus. But other than that, this album is strong. The best is Follow Me Up, the Marley Marl remix. One, it has Marley Marl behind the beats. (note LL, your man can still produce, maybe you need to get him to lace tracks for you again.) I think Marley even gets a verse in. Also One Shot Deal where Pop and two MC's, which I have no idea who, doesn't sound like the GP Wu members, rip it up. Get this, support true hip hop. If not, continue to support wack artist like Nelly, Chingy, Lil Flip and G-Unit."
4,4.5 RATING GREAT UNDERGROUND,"Pop Da Brown Hornet album Underground Emperor is a tight debue. If you Liked G.P. Wu album you will like this. Ill produced by RNS, and tight lyrics by Pop. The whole album delievers except 8 ""hold It Down"", which is more R&B type that does not fit in the album. Could have used a few more songs also. But overall Pop's album does the purpose for a tight underground joint."
5,A very very good french album!,"You want french rap disc? This disc is for you! It's a bestseller in France! This cd contain the hit ""Sales gosses""...A very good cd!"
2,Buyer beware,"The ""includes two flags"" or ""2X"" aspect of this flag is false. Upon ordering two of them, expecting 4 flags, I received only 2. After complaining, Amazon was quick to respond, but only sent 1 more. Not worth the frustration...On a brighter note - the product itself is sturdy and well built. Definitely not a cheapy flag that will wear out after a few drives - it is built to last.Only 2 stars due to the faulty advertising of the ""2X"" aspect of this item, otherwise would have been 5 stars for sure."
1,Hooks up but doesn't work,"It hooks up all the right pins, but for me it doesn't give any signal back to my Mac Mini to recognize that a monitor is even connected. I don't get any chance to fiddle with the DIP switches for resolution because the computer doesn't even know a TV (monitor) is attached. I was really hopeful this would enable me to keep my old projection TV going with a computer attached."
4,Came quickly,WHat can I say? It is an adapter. I just wish an instruction sheet came with it to explain the DIP switch settings.
2,Not that great!,"I purchased this for my 8 month old daughter in order to help her explore her environment better than she could on the floor (and I give her plenty of floor time). It was difficult to put the wheels on, the bears on it don't really keep her occupied for more than 5 minutes and it doesn't roll very well (we have carpet inside) but I took her outside for more play time and it didn't roll well out their either. The wheels don't go side to side, only back and forth, so it takes a lot of effort for them to turn. It is also not very good for taller babies, from day one I've had it on the highest setting and even that seems almost too low for her (she's 27 inches tall). I've had it for almost a month now and she's only spent about 15 minutes total in it. Cheap, but not even worth the money. Maybe the ones with independent wheels are better but I'd spend my money next time on something else."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this walker!","I don't know what I did without this walker, it allows my son the freedom to move about and gives me the freedom to do the things I need to do without carrying him around. Once again I wasn't sure whether I should purchase this one or not because it's so much less ($30.00) than all of the other choices but after doing some research and going to Babies R' Us and putting my son in the floor displays of walkers this was the obvious choice. This walker is more compact than the others and seems to move easier. The others have more activity toys but to me that's what the activity centers are for and although this one just has two bears and some blocks to pull across the bar he loves it. This is definitely the case where less is more - this is a great walker for the price!"
3,Could be a potential problem,"My 8 month old daughter loves being in her walker, maybe a little too much! She managed to pull off one of the bears on the toy bar. I was not worried about her choking on it since it's so large, but the plastic part on the toy bar was rough and a bit sharp. I called the company to complain and they are sending out a new toy bar. You can't beat the price, but I'm still not pleased with the product overall. I knew my daughter was strong, but this is ridiculous!"
2,CHOKING HAZARD,"Although my 8 month old loves to be in this walker - DO NOT USE THE ACTIVITY BAR. She ripped off one of the teddy bears, and proceeded to BREAK the stem that held the bear on the bar...it easily broke into a piece that was about an inch long - if she wasn't being watched closely, she could have choked on the piece.POOR MANUFACTURING IF YOU ASK ME."
5,Great Basic Walker!!! Only one problem....,"It's not tall enough. I registered for this walker for my daughter and she has absolutely LOVED IT!! I first put her in it a 3 1/2 months old and I have gotten at least three times my ""money's worth"" out of this toy. My only problem is that now at 9 1/2 months she's to tall to play in it (29 inches) the height does adjust, but the highest setting isn't quite high enough for my long-legged baby girl. I had to put it away because when she tried to push it, she had to drag her feet behind her and actually kept getting them caught under the back bar.Overall it has been a great toy!! I just wish I could have used it for a couple more months! I would definately recommend!"
2,My four month old pulled off the teddy bears!,So watch it! I could not believe my eyes. I threw the whole thing in the garbage immediately.
3,not a very bad buy,"i bought this walker for my 12 weeks old baby. i know it's a bit early to put her in the walker because she can't even sit straight up. but, i want her to practice more on her back that's why i bought this very basic walker. she actually likes the toy on the edge because she reaches out her hands and tries to grab it, plus she looks into the toy with so much concentration, that really amazes me.the bad things of this walker: the seat can't really snap to the whole. it keeps falling out every time i pick up my baby.the walker only goes straight. it can't turn.not much entertainment in it."
1,Missing Wheels,I gave this as a Christmas gift to my niece. They put it together today and the walker is missing the wheels. I would like to return this item but I purchased it 10/31/05. It seems I can't return this item and I was just an early Christmas Shopper.Please contact me if you can help me.
1,Broken Toy Bar,"My baby was excited, however I wasn't. I could have purchased a used walker at a thrift shop for much less that would have been in one piece. The bear was busted in half!!! Anyone know how to contact this company? There is no literature on how to contact toys r us about crumby material. Please email me at gailcrazythunder@hotmail.com if you have the phone number. Thanks for your help."
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can not believe that this product is for sale! ALL WALKERS ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, and I do believe that most Pediatricians warn parents with regards to walkers. Walkers are actually banned and not allowed to be sold in Canada. The same should be done in the U.S. - Please do not buy this or any other walker with wheels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I only gave this item a star because you have to give at least one in order for this to be posted. There is no option for NO STARS!!"
2,Not great,The back wheels don't move freely. When my grandson goes backwards he can not turn. Also doesn't work on carpet.
2,Ok on flat surfaces...,"I purchased this a couple of years ago after I had surgery and could not bend and reach for a long time. It is fine on flat, straight surfaces, such as shower walls, however it does not work well on the curves of a bath tub. What bugs me the most is that the bristle brush comes loose from the pole and I have to constantly screw it back on. This makes it too frustrating for me to use!"
3,A Bare-bones introduction to SAP Screens/Navigation,"This is one of those bed-time easy reader type books that you can read quickly. It exposes you to an overview of how SAP screens appear and how one can navigate in the plethora of screens SAP supplies. Given that it costs 10 bucks or thereabouts, it will be useful to have it in the corporate library. Dont set your expectations high though!"
1,Takes longer than 10 minutes to read - Unfortunately!!,"I purchased this book for a friend so that maybe they may be able to understand what SAP is all about. Wrong! It's realy designed for those people sat by an SAP system, if you are then use the very good SAP documentation provided!This book is a complete waste of money; how on earth can you write a 10 minute guide to one of the most complex systems in the world? The book is flawed in many places... USE THE STANDARD DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINING MATERIAL FROM SAP."
3,Good card - terrible printer utilities,"Easy enough to add the card but the utility on the HP Lasernet 4015 was terrible to use and hard to configure the card.,"
5,Really Fast Shipping,"What a small world, order something from Amazon and it ships less then 150 from your home.Book was is excellent condition. Thank You.We went to Forest Lodge this pass weekend, amazing how they lived in the woods back in the 40's. This place, even today, is in the middle of no wheres. We drove 17 miles on dirt roads and then took our mountain bikes and went another 4 miles down the Carry Road.They did this by foot or by car, unbelievable."
3,"Disappointing after ""We Took to the Woods""","Having read many of her books about her life in rural Maine, I was disappointed with this one. It is written in the same simple style which is enjoyable to read but the content was not as good. Most of this book is about the various people who lived near the author. Discussions on their personality quirks and the mundain details of their lives are not really all that interesting. The stories are only intersting to those who know these people. I enjoy reading books like this to learn what life is like for others is situations different from mine. I learned nothing new with this one. I am glad I did not read this book first or I never would have read her others."
3,A must-have for nursing students,"This book really is a must have item. You need to have it to get through nursing school. The specific product that I received had folded pages and was a bit worn, but I don't really plan to keep the same copy for after school. If anything, I'll buy a newer edition when the time comes."
1,"Not worth the money, in my opinion",I had to purchase this book as a required text in nursing school. I find it very difficult to read and follow. Everytime I've had to use it I dread opening it. I have since ordered two other care plan books hoping that one of them will be easier to read and use. My clinical instructor agreed that there are much better books on the market for this purpose. Please look around before you decide to purchase this text.
3,Book cover,Isn't the book cover suppose to be blue? Why is it pink in this image?? Please help. I need this book asap
1,frustrating,we recieved this book as part of our nursing corriculum and most of us hate it! it is very hard toi navigate and you end up wasting your time. Most of us have had to waste our money getting other books. I DO NOT reccoment!
3,Bad choice. dissapointed after hearing good things about this book,"The condition of the book was great, but the content in the book, not what I expected. It was confusing to use."
3,A metaphor for American History,"This book is Vidal comment on the american society and how it came to be - and could be, and it is about presidency and running the country - and overall, quite philosophical and insightful view on the american condition. I think the other reviewers fail to see the depth of the work."
1,I got to page 25,"I got to page 25 before I gave up. I was not engaged by either the main character or the plot (if any) enough to continue.from my very brief sojourn into the book, it looked to me like the author was developing the plot in a silly kind of "" say whatever comes into my head"" sort of manner. Anyway, just couldn't get into the silliness. It is supposed to be a kind of historical satire I guess, but the humor seemed kind of adolescent."
4,Entertaining and irreverant,"Is this one of Vidal's masterpieces? No. But it is a highly entertaining and wickedly funny stab at a genre (science fiction) that takes itself much too seriously. Included are barbed jabs at the idiocy of politicians and the incompetancy of government. While there's not much to say about the plot, you can certainly enjoy the ride. And, what's with that dreadful cover art?"
2,Beware This Whimsical Vidal,"Coming after the ""Back to the Future"" movie trilogy, with its perfectly placed conundrums and insanely ingenious plot twists, and after Stephen Fry's capricious ""Making History,"" another good, fully thought-out alternative history, this Gore Vidal opus rather pales in comparison. Vidal tackles Big Physics, but gets immediately lazy and is unable and/or unwilling to flesh out the math and the scientific concepts. So we're left with a hodge-podge of famous characters, past presidents mostly, who behave arbitrarily and a plot that turns arbitrarily. What's the point? I don't know - ""life's a silly game"" maybe? This could have been an excellent book to give to your teenage son (if for no other reason than that it shows a kid doing something other than staring dumbly at his computer) but the graphic sex is probably something most parents wouldn't feel comfortable passing on to their ""impressionable"" offspring."
2,A Tired Re-Hash,"If you visited with Vidal in ""Myron"" and ""Live from Golgotha"" then you'll find this book a tired re-hash of attempts to alter time and fun and games with historical characters. Same blase and cynical tone. However, what this book sorely lacks is a character with the style of Myra Breckinridge to handle the proceedings."
1,a piece of junk,"Sure, if you can get past his stereotypes of Native Americans and other ethnic groups; his homophobia; and his racism; then you might actually enjoy this book. I take that back. Mr. Vidal is so full of himself, so self-conscious of his sentences, that its impossible to focus on the story. He's always smirking and trying to show why he's smarter than someone else. It might be better if he picked up some of the classics and learned a lesson or two. Is he iconoclastic? No, just close minded."
5,"Great Knife, You don't need it unless you are a Pro",This knife is great can be used like a cleaver or standard Chef's knife. Wusthof makes the best knives by far. All my knives are Wusthof.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"WONDERFUL!!! Can't say enough!! I have VERY sensitive eyes & this mascara is perfect for me... YES! long, beautiful lashes"
4,Nice watch,"It's a quality watch with some nice features. Here are a few things I found out after I received it. The ""regular"" second hand only moves when using the stopwatch. The real second hand is the little one by the 9. The alarm setting/usage is a little more complex then I would like as I probably won't have the manual with me when I want to use it. It's a little larger diameter and thicker then I would have hoped for (but I don't have very large wrists)."
5,Very informational,I bought this book for a class and is very good in explaining and providing step-by-step instructions on how to plan a good and extensive research.
4,From a Vet,"Mr. Brady did a good job of describing a Marine's life in the 1951 era of the Korean War. However, he comes up short on time after the 1st Mar. Div. moved to the western front. Makes me think he changed assignments, from Platoon leader to something else, because he didn't have much of a handle on the 1952 western front action. No doubt in my mind about him being Platoon Leader in 1951 on the Eastern Front.I served in Korea May, 1952 through May, 1953 as a Forward Observer. There was a lot of action in the First Marine Division Sector after they moved to the Western Front.cob"
2,In serious need of an Editor.,I have read many books on the Korean war and I found this one the most difficult to read. Many grammatical errors and sentences with entire words missing.I appreciate the authors effort but feel this work should have been finely tuned by a qualified editor before publishing.
2,terrible,Book reads like a novel and does not seem to capture the real experience of combat. There are events which may be historically acurate but does not seem to capture the true essence of the combat experience. Most of his memories seem to be romanticized rather than demonstrating the horror of war.
2,"A fair read, with problems...","This book was just ok. What bothers me is that Brady gives intricate details of his life during the war, but that was almost 40 YEARS before the book was written. How could anyone remember the mundane details of life 40 years prior? It just strikes me as unrealistic."
4,Who knew?,"Who thought that the man who brings us the underwhelming In Step interviews every Sunday could write such a fascinating autobiography?Don't get me wrong, I enjoy his work for Parade -- it's a guilty pleasure! But his tale of life in Korea, during the forgotten war is an excellent read.The Coldest War doesn't bore you to death with military minutiae and ancronyms -- James Brady was a reservist, not a career Marine. The author doesn't get bogged down in terminology, so the book flows easily.The narrative is superb -- the reader (at least this one) feels as if he or she is in the trench shivering with Brady on his first ambush.Highly recommended!"
3,all topo or national geographic?,"Both were great when new. Now outdated, they are often ignored in favor of google or some other internet map source.I liked the Geographic ones for their overlapping of quad sections, so that prints could be more nicely managed. Also, when scanning, they simply moved in any direction without edges. All TOPO does not do that. To move from one topo map to an adjacent one you mark the spot on the next map and it will bring up that map at that mark. They can't be blended, therefore inconveniences arise in viewing and printing."
3,Traditions?,"This book's title is misleading. Half of it is factual information which you can find elsewhere and the other half is, is one person's take on Ancient Egyptian religion. A sort of Egyptian 'Ride a Silver Broomstick' imitating a sourcebook.I've bookmarked a few useful places. Steer clear of the rituals which seem plucked from Herodotus. Some of the Tables try to bridge to the Western mystery tradition (a big nono). I've studied Ancient Egyptian Religion for decades and seen some shockingly attrocius books- this is not one of them and has some good factual information, but the ritual content is of no value at all.An expensive bookshelf filler that will be set aside by the student very quickly."
5,Excellent Heartwarming Story,I am a first grade teacher and my students love this book. It seems many of them can relate to this story as so many of them know someone who has had a preemie. This story is very helpful to young children who have a younger sibling who was born early. It is also good as a classroom read aloud. I highly recommend it!
4,Works Great! Came Chipped,"My wife and I decided to get this casserole dish after wanting to cook a recipe that required one and not having it. It works great, the only problem I have is that when it arrived a little sliver along the edge of the lid was chipped off. (1/8th inch by 3 inches I'd say). Not a huge deal, everything still cooks fine, and obviously shipping glass through UPS (or any carrier) comes with risks. But I wanted to share my experience!"
3,"Good, basic cookware, but hard to serve from!","We've had a number of these dishes over the years. They're simple, easy to clean, and something everyone should have in their kitchen.Why, then, did I only give this a three-star rating? Well, the main thing we use these for is cooking veggies in the microwave. Because of the bowl shape, however, it's nearly impossible to scoop vegetables (or anything else, really), out without flipping some of the food out of the dish, and onto the table or floor. You can get around this, by holding your hand or another utensil over the edge as you scoop, so the hand or utensil catches the food - but really, who wants to have to mess with that?I'm shopping for something with vertical sides!"
4,Nice!,"These things are great for microwaving frozen veggies (or other frozen stuff). After accidentally breaking my old glass dish I bought this Pyrex, and so far really happy with it. It has perfect size for me and looks very nice. Made in US...4/5 stars for the glass lid which does not fit good enough."
5,Pyrex Bakeware 1-1/2 Casserole Dish with Lid,I bought the Pyrex Bakeware Casserole Dish with lid @Amazon.com. I have used it frequently and ordered another in a different size. I think the bakeware is a terrific item and plan to use it for a long time !
5,needed house hold item found,"use these bowls constantly. was very pleased to find them on amazon, we were unable to find them locally in any kind of store. Thanks"
4,"perfect for ideas, for dreaming, and filling your life with great memories","I picked this up in a thrift store recently for $25 cents. I figured the ideas that I quickly read on some pages were worthy enough of such a meager price. Now that I own it, my parents want to borrow it.So, when I feel lonely or want to fill my time with something to dream about, I just open this little book for inspiration. It never fails to put a smile on my face. Great ideas: from some that are purely innocent to some that are a little raunchy, from ideas for outdoors to ideas for indoors, from philanthropic ideas to very pragmatic and family-related ideas. Great ideas for dating a new gal and also for taking your wife out on a date.You will not be disappointed to peruse this little book!"
3,Ordinary Book with some Brilliant Ideas,"This is a no nonsense list of 500 things you can do with your wife/Girlfriend. When I started reading suggestions i felt a little stupid reading those items. Many of the items I had already done and some of them I will never do. But some ideas are really brilliant and suggestions like those kept me reading the book. This book will help more to newbies in love might not have too much for matured relationships.In simple words, Its just a list of items you can do with your partner and nothing more."
1,Not Made in USA instead made in CHINA,"Item not made in USA but instead made in China. I do not buy food cooking, baking or serving related items made in China. Returned immediately."
4,Nice cooling rack,This is a great rack for cooling larger cakes and multiple small cakes. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the shippers bent it so that they could force it into the box. There was no lasting damage but these racks should not be bent! Sloppy Shipping.
4,Functional item for holiday baking,Ramping up the cookie production for the holidays? This item holds about 2 standard cookie sheets worth of cookies or two 9inch round cake layers for cooling. Substantial enough to hold the weight of the cakes without flexing too much and no rust so far. Does the job.
1,Outdated cell phone,"Made the mistake of buying this cellphone from a private buyer who did not want to accept it back. I sent it back regardless and then they didn't want to credit me for it, but Amazon came through with their buyer guarantee and I did not lose my money (except for mailing it). The cellphone was and bulky. Archaic."
5,Brilliant,"All right I never actualy saw this on video but on T.V. And I must say that it has griped me to watch every episode since. The acting is brilliant, and the action is always there. In a way its kind of like star trek but with atitude. I would have to say that it is my most faviort programe and should be every ones who likes sci fi. A fabulus must see that others underrate due to closed minds. ***** five big platiunm stars."
2,"Good series, BAD execution...","SG-1 is one of the better shows on television these days, but the quality of this dvd is sorely lacking... scenes that should pan smoothly are choppy and obtrusive which pulls you out of the story... even scenes of dialog are choppy, which ends up looking like a dubbed foreign show! There's no excuse for this on a vhs tape, so why such a bad transfer to dvd? Save your money and tape the reruns..."
3,Videophile Bonus,"All 3 episodes on DVD are actually high resolution, anamorphic/ 16:9 widescreen enhanced - the preferred format for High Definition TV sets. This was a special treat, as the storage case does not even list this! (the ""technical info"" notes here at Amazon incorrectly lists it as 4:3 aspect ratio).The films themselves are a ""must-have"" for any Stargate or SG1 fan, & are a good way to introduce non-fans to the series.The Jack O'Neil & Daniel Jackson characters are portrayed especially well, & are far more satisfying than their counterparts in the original 1994 movie. Richard Dean Anderson in particular brings a welcome bit of humour to the role - O'Neil isn't the one dimensional semi-suicidal tough guy of the 94 movie."
4,The best Sci-Fi series ever made.,I really enjoyed this DVD and was surprised to find out that it was presented in a widescreen format which I liked. I also watch the series whenever it's on and never miss an episode. I hope MGM releases more episodes on DVD.
5,Are There going to be any new releases Stargate SG-1.,It was a grate movie need to see more and need to put it back on the scifi channel.
5,What's the problem?,"I'm seeing a lot of unnecessary criticism of, simply, a beautiful, naked woman, aka, Vaitiare Bandara/Shau`ri. I can't help but think that people who feel the need to act all holier-than-thou about nudity must have a real hard time taking a shower. Anyway, sheep-people (except those of you who think for yourselves and don't allow their lives and opinions be shaped by the mass media and these so-called ""authority figures"" of the western world), ya gotta love this season premiere. It's got it all. Alien cultures, advanced weaponry, oppressive snakes, dry-cool wit (mostly on the part of one of my favorite actors, Richard Dean Anderson, way better than emotionless Kurt Russell), astro-physics (Carter), treason (Teal`c), a look into the Hollywood air force, and, of course, uncensored nudity. Mmm, yum."
3,How to get an elephant into a Lada.,"All with all a nice idea for a movie, however I miss character development. It's hard to feel sympathy for people you hardly know; so the involvement into the story stays back. One more objection is that to much is happening in to little time. It's kind of like getting an elephant into a Lada."
4,Volume,I noticed a few reviewers said that the unit's volume capabilitis were not adequeate. Has anyone tried using different headphones then the ones that ship with the unit? I had RIO 500 that had the same problem but worked great after I replaced the haedphons.I am interested in buying this player but not if its volume is really an issue.
2,"Upload is slow and it doesn't support WMA, plus more...",I usually like Samsung products but this one doesn't make the grade.-The upload time to the unit is quite slow.-The unit does not support WMA.-The unit does not integrate with Windows Media Player.-The unit does not integrate with Musicmatch.-The real biggy! This unit does not support MP3's of different bit rates. You must make them all the same bit rate!There are some good points though. It's physically well designed and the buttons are well layed out. I really liked the little clip on remote. Very handy for sticking out of a backpak!Unfortunately the guts of this product did not meet the standards of the shell.2 out of 5 stars.
1,This disc is terrible.,"I bought this CD the day it came out and I was horribly disappointed. It has no depth. There is none of what made Dread Zeppelin great. There is no fun. There is charm. I wouldn't call this CD melodic, I would just call it boring.I understand that bands must make a departure from what they've done before to grow and to stay fresh. But this disc just sounds phoned in. Greg Tortel displays none of the vocal range that he has displayed in the past. There is little guitar. Just synthesizer and recorded drum tracks. Calling it elevator music is being generous.If you like Dread Zeppelin, don't buy this disc. If you've never listen to Dread Zeppelin, don't buy this disc. Get one of the earlier ones."
5,AMAZING CD!!!!,This CD is so heart-warming; some of the melodies and the lyrics that go with them have brought tears to my on various occasions. Leeland is super good at making simple concepts so surreal and realistic.
5,Sound of Melodies is an awesome album...,Leeland is unbelievably gifted. This album is amazing. I love almost every title on this CD...just wonderful. :-)
5,Sound of Melodies,"This is a very good Christian band. I recommend this to any one who likes songs with real messages about whats going on in the world today. My favorite song is ""Tears of the Saints"" it is really AWESOME, it makes me cry everytime I hear it.God Bless"
4,A strong debut,"The hype on this band has been astronimical, so when I got the CD I was a little suspicious of what I'd find. Could they be as good as everyone else said? Well, they're definitely good. ""Reaching"" is a great song and deserves a ton of radio air play. ""Beautiful Lord"" makes an incredible worship song. Most all the tracks are good, though those two in particular really stand out. Hindalong did a great job in producing, and Leeland's vocals show promise for a long future (he's a teenager and rocks harder than most adults). I look forward to what they come up with next."
5,Astounding! Fresh & new!,"I wish I could communicate like some of the great reviewers here on Amazon so please pardon my sloppy use of the English language.This band makes me feel things inside that I haven't felt in a long time.Incredible melodies, inspiring lyrics, tight band arrangements and the kind of vocals that make you sing along in praise and worship.(No one believes me but I sing very well when I'm alone in the car and the music is cranked all the way up) Well.... maybe not very well.... not even well... but at least singing with these guys makes me feel like I'm a part of their worship and...... the Focus is Christ.Not a bad song in the lot."
5,A new era has begun!,"Every few years a band comes along that has the potential to completely change the face of Christian music and im not exaggerating when i say Leeland is that band.Not since the emergence of Delirious? have we seen a band that puts it all out there like a heart on a sleeve. Leeland changes that however, with lyrics i wouldn't be able to comprehend writing at such a young age, vocals that drop your jaw and the musical prowess of Coldplay, Leeland has it ALL.Listen to this CD had be hooked but then do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes to experience Leeland play live...it will absolutely blow you away. Leeland are one of those bands that you could say sound EVEN better live than on CD."
5,Beautiful CD,This is a beautiful CD. I have all of Al Grants CD's and love each one. Anyone who is a fan of Jim Reeves would love Al Grant. He sounds just like Jim Reeves. You won't be sorry if you buy it.
2,My son is scared of it!!!,"The music is too loud, and coupled with the flashing lights...my 7 month old cries everytime I turn this thing on. He does not like this toy, and he is the most easy going baby ever. He has a mellow personality and is the happiest baby I have ever seen. Always smiling, except when we turn this toy on."
4,"beautiful music, beautiful lights","My son recieved the Sunny Sunshine as a first birthday gift. I was a little concerned that he was too old for it, but he actually enjoys it quite a bit and likes to interact with the ""arms"" of the sun. I would agree with other reviewers that the music is simply too loud for bedtime, but I've found that playing the music during bath/pj time helps to calm my son and prepare him for bed."
2,Save your money,I purchased two of these. One for myself and one for a friend. The piece that holds the ship in place is plastic and has a pin that tends to break. My friend broke his the same night I gave it to him and mine is now setting broken in my living room. Save your money.
4,"TARZAN MEETS THE BIBLE, SORTA KINDA...","This book is interesting as it is a compilation of a bunch of Korean myths that seem to all fit together, as well as including plenty of archetypes from Western culture.Like many of Mr. Lee's works, the total story runs in multi-volume arcs, so much of this first tome is set-up for the apocalypse to come. Still, there's much entertainment to found, especially if you like murderous primatives, nude buxom heroines, and fantastic illustrations of wild animals.Book 1 revolves around a man who would do anything to become the ruler of the land, and the unholy price he'll have to apy to acheive it. There's loads of symbolism, way too much to get into here, and it's all very shocking and intriguing.The artwork is simply stunning with all the detail in shadow and figures. And although well over 300 pages, Mythology is a quick read, as the illustrations tell most of the story.Highly recommended."
5,great old movie,I bought this for a person I take care of and he loved it. It took him back to some good years.
5,Outstanding Series Deserves More Than Partial Collections,"Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection Volume I is a good beginning, but not a final solution, to the desire of Western fans to have all of the episodes of the longest-running American dramatic television series. This fine show is always ignored when the greatest television shows of all time are mentioned, but it lasting 20 years is not merely the product of network programmers, but loyal viewers who enjoyed the cast, great acting, great writing, and great direction.Standout episodes include the first broadcast episode ""Matt Gets It,"" Hack Prine"" (the pilot episode), ""Quint Asper Comes Home"" (the introduction of Burt Reynolds' character), and ""Prairie Wolfer"" (the introduction of Festus Haggins' character). All of the episodes are entertaining and enjoyable. But Gunsmoke fans want and need more. We want all 20 seasons on DVD, as unreasonable as that sounds. We'll make it worth Paramount's while."
5,very satisfied....,"The Gunsmoke 50th anniversary collection, volumn 1 was delivered verypromptly. Quality very good. Have really enjoyed each episode, especiallythe black and white ones."
5,Awsome,Hubby loved it. We watched these together and have a good time watching them. Would recommend if you r a gunsmoke fan
4,It's a must if you like Gunsmoke,"It was good to go back and see the earlier versions of Gunsmoke with Chester. It's nice to look at the older episodes and find that they were as well done as the later ones. It's the best western ever in both the black and white or the color. If you like Gunsmoke you can't go wrong with this set of DVD""s"
4,Bad Recipe,The recepie on the box does not produce good muffin. You need to add egg to make it good.
4,Movivational . . .,"Kenyon comes across as the big brother or loving dad who really believes in you. This little 72-page booklet contains nearly three dozen, one-to-two-page motivational clips. Any one of them contains energy-packed words of encouragement to get you jump-started. I suggest reading one or two in the morning, or anytime you need a quick shot of encouragement. Kenyon's style is tight, compact, and to the point. You won't find in-depth theological teaching in this booklet, but you will find a ""you-can-do-it"" message to get you going when your motivation is flagging. I treasured a copy I owned in my early twenties, and was delighted to find it again - available on Amazon - fifteen years later. I read a page or two several times a week, and it still helps - a lot."
5,Well worth the money...,"Net Results: Web Marketing That Works is an excellent book for every webmarketers. It covers the most fundamental and yet power techniques to help you build the traffic to your site. The bottom line is that I found this book to be extremely informative about marketing strategies on the internet. It provides useful tips on how to get interest in your site, without spending a fortune."
5,"Dr. Lowe says, ""I use it as a graduate Internet textbook",Net Results:Web Marketing that Works is the book I selected as the textbook for my graduate Internet Marketing class at San Francisco State University. It covers all aspects of marketing online. It is easy to read and understand. The information is comprehensive and on point. It has plenty of real world examples and resources for more information. Currently there is no viable textbook for the classroom because there is a lack of serious research on the internet. This book combines excellent Internet content and an easy to read style that makes it a joy to read. Kudo's to Rick Bruner for this excellent book. This is the third semester I have adopted it.
2,"Plenty of Net, Not Much Marketing","I had high expectations for this book, especially with my knowledge of USWEB as a large internet professional services organization. I was bored with the rehash of internet knowledge and put it down after reviewing sections of the entire book.The book has 50 pages dedicated to nothing but oversized URLS and is heavy on large graphics and big type throughout. Looks like they ran out of interesting things to say.How about a book that addresses the fundamental problems most companies are having with their web sites:? Branding, Image, Organization, Site Structure, E-commerce approaches, and Advertising. Reviewing fundamental principles of traditional marketing (see the ""22 Laws"") instead of getting bogged down with this USWEB case study brochure seems much more helpful."
3,"Careful, it's fragile","This shredder (like most) is top heavy, and I accidentally knocked it over last week. It immediately stopped working. I called the customer service line at Royal, who told me that I can send it back to them with a copy of my receipt (which I don't have anymore) and they would make a determination of whether to replace it.So I did what all the warning labels said not to. I opened it up and rewired it to bypass the safety circuit (that makes it shut down when the shredder is disconnected from the basket). Now it works again.But I don't recommend this item."
4,Good for home use,"This is our second Royal 7-sheet crosscut paper shredder. The first shredder worked for 2+ years when the motor seized. This shredder is good for occassional use. It will overheat if used continuously. That's how we broke the first one, we were shredding boxes full of paper. This is great for shedding small amounts of mail each day. It is strong enough to shred credit cards.We'd buy this one again if our current unit breaks after 2 years."
2,A beginners book,"Very very basic introduction to FCP. Do not be fooled by the word ""professional"" in the title. It is aimed for complete new comers. As a professional editor I found that the book answered very little to any questions I may had. It is a good beginners book."
2,disapointin,"After I heard the first single ""Baller Blockin"" I bought the album thinking its gotta be good if all the cashmoney krew r dropping songs on the cd. To my surprise track 02 ""baller blockin"" was the only good production on the whole album. The cashmoney production on this cd was not up to its usual level. Wat was most dissapointing about the album was nearly half the tracks didnt feature anyone from cashmoney. If u want a betta cd buy Guerrila Warefare instead..................."
2,The Beginning of their fall from platinum status,"Here it is: 400 Degreez amazing, G-Code Not Bad, The Block is hot tight, I got that work is straight, and Lights Out is alright but extremely commercial. This CD is bull. The only good songs are Thugged out, Project Chick, Let us Stunt, and Uptown. Lil Wayne and Juvenile songs are garbage, Baller Blockin, and Family Affair was alright. But this CD is straight terrible, trust me it's not even worth 5$."
5,CMB FO LIFE,"All u cashmoney fans this again is a must buy, pretty much everything is tight, to the first single baller blockin with baby,juvenile,turk,and e40, and all the special guests make this album even better than the usual, the hottest joint on there is uptown by turk, and look for turks debut album to be dropping hopefully sometime this fall or winter.."
1,Worst Coffee Maker Ever - Looking for a refund it's so bad,"Its gorgeous, but don't get sucked in. It's the worst coffee maker ever. And I've been a loyal Bodum customer, but this maker is so bad I want a refund.I'm sorry, but even *if* it's me that sucks, a 98 dollar maker should prevent me from making a weak and cold cup of coffee.This has been one of my most frustrating consumer experiences ever and I really want my money back.Bodum Santos Stovetop Glass Vacuum 34-Ounce Coffee Maker"
1,Do not buy this product,"This vacuum coffee maker is a piece of junk, do not waste your time or money. I tried and failed to make coffee four times with the first unit and again with a replacement unit. The top pot filled with water as it should have, but the filter became plugged no matter what grind was used. Any vacuum created was enough to clear the filter. No amount of tinkering improved the nonstarter performance. The cheap price may be attractive, but don't be fooled - the quality and design are so poor it doesn't work. Do not buy this product."
2,It's a good cup o' joe when it makes one!,"I was very disappointed with this product. After reading the rave reviews from other Amazon users, I decided to purchase this coffee maker. When it arrived, I anxiously awaited my first cup of delicious coffee. Instead, what I got was a mess! The thing didn't work right and the instruction ""card"" (just pictures) that comes in the box doesn't explain how to adjust the maker or offer hints if it doesn't ""do"" right. I was successful at getting it to work properly once or twice; but finally gave up after wasting over a pound of coffee trying. My advice? Don't bother."
1,Disappointed,"After reading all these reviews, I ordered this pot and could not wait to have my first cup of excellent coffee.I understand that this process takes a longer time to complete and I was all ready for that, too.However, I refuse to go through the debacle again of trying to brew coffee in this pot.Following the instructions, using coarse ground coffee, I proceeded to make the coffee. However, once the coffee was in the upper chamber, it simply stayed there. I assume because the filter got plugged.I had to pour a small amount at a time into my other coffee pot, through its filter in order to complete this project.I'll try it one more time, but if you ask me, this is poorly spent [money]."
2,rubbery taste,"It is sure fun to look at coffeemaker making coffee. But, could anyone tell me what I did wrong? My coffee from this coffee maker tasted like rubber."
3,Just For Looks,"If the production of coffee gives you as much pleasure as drinking a cup than the bodum might be for you. But if you want a fast easy cup of coffee stick with a ...Mr. Coffee. The results are the same.The Bodum instructions would like you to use a scoup of grounds for every cup you plan on making. If you want to use that much coffee you could also make a deliscious cup with an old soup can and a candle. If you follow the instructions and use that much coffee you will have a cup on par with any other coffee maker out there, only with more work and clean up.After some experimentation I'm using the regular amount of grounds and double or triple brewing the pot, which is very easy to do with the Santo's. If it had been any more expensive I would have returned it.If you are having guests over for coffee the Santo's will get their attention but if you are after a simple quality cup of morning coffee go elsewhere."
5,The Stovetop Santos is Much Superior to the Electric Model,I have had both the stove top and the electric Santos and the stove top wins hands down. I found with the electric model I cannot choose how long the water and coffee brews - it is all automated. With the stove top - I can let the water and coffee brew together a little longer and I've found that it makes for a more complex cup of coffee. I have had the stove top model for years and thought that the electric model would be a nice upgrade - WRONG! The coffee tasted and looked rather weak when compared to my stove top. I eventually just gave my electric model to my local thrift store! Another added bonus to the Stovetop is that you can really wow your guests. I love to bring the coffee maker to the table for my guests to see the coffee slowly drip down to the lower carafe. It's coffee and entertainment all in one!!!
3,Form over function,"It's incredible to watch the coffee being made but you're also involved in watching a pot boil. The vacuum process is a mystery to me and it's very interesting but I'd only purchase this for Sunday afternoons. The entire process requires a little effort to set up and a little dirty work to clean up. The coffee tastes great. Massive drawback is the fact that you are dealing with two glass bowls, open flame, and (presumably) you haven't had a cup of coffee yet. I give mine less than thirty uses before I break it."
5,Best Coffeemaker,"Even after breaking at least 5 of these over the past 10 years, I will not use any other type of coffeemaker. It simply makes the best unadulterated coffee..."
2,too delicate and too much work,"I have had vacuum brewed coffee in restaurants and loved it. It was fun to watch and delicious, however, the bodum vacuum model is so delicate and so much work that I have decided to stick with the french press. The bodum spirit burner that came with the set took an hour to force the water into the upper chamber. Also the filter clogged and overbrewed the coffee. This coffeemaker requires constant supervision and carefully ground coffee (not too fine, not too coarse). Overall I would not recommend it, particularly if you plan to use the spirit burner."
5,Finally,"Finally a coffee maker that does not take up a lot of counter space; that does not require those nasty paper filters; that does not periodically need a vinegar cleaning; and one that is not permanently coffee stained. More importantly, I can finally make a great cup of coffee.If this coffee maker is stored on an open counter or shelf, it looks almost like sculpture. It's fun too, and mornings need a bit of fun in addition to a good cup or two of coffee.Even if guests don't get to see the way coffee is made with this Bodum, they'll be able to join me in a superb cup of coffee, and I'll get the kudos!"
1,Does not seal correctly,"I purchased this maker from another site but it is the same one about a week ago. From the beginning it did not operate properly for a vacuum maker. The grommet (rubber?) between the two halves does not seal as it should. I tried different techniques .. dry it real well, heat it up, cool it off etc.. It does make coffee and it does taste good. But I do not relish having to stand over it and make sure the vacuum seal stays tight by pressing down on the top unit. The normal pot will suck the coffee down quickly from the top as soon as you remove it from the heat; however, this one does not!!!! Eventually and very slowly it will draw the coffee down. It did do as I describe only once. I have ordered another grommet from the Bodum site (shipping etc. ) ... if this does not resolve the problem then I will purchase a different one. The original site I purchased it from does not follow up with complaints."
4,Get ready for some awesome nonsense coffee!,"No, but really. Just watching this thing work is fascinating.It's requires the most amount of interaction to use a vaccum coffee brewer. But that amounts to: 'fill lower glass with water, put spring thing and rubber thing on top glass, put top glass on lower glass, add coffee grinds to top glass, put on lid, activate heat.' So basically, it's super duper simple to use, don't let that discourage you.The coffee that comes out of the nonsense brewer is absolutely fantastic, and as always from Bodum the quality of the important bits are great. The handle on the bottom glass should really be thicker, and there's a plastic cone thing that doesn't seem to have any purpose... I think it's supposed to be a stand for the top glass, but it's WAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY to small to be used as such.Overall, if you like coffee, get a vacuum brewer. This one is a good choice."
4,"Great Coffee maker, Okay filter",I have a few siphons and this is one of my favorites. It makes a mean cup of bold flavorful coffee and can be done on the stove top. My issue with this brewer is the filter. If you don't use coarse grinds (which I'm not a huge fan of) the filter will become clogged especially once you have made a few pots on it. The filter is a heat resistant plastic with grooves cut in it and it does become more and more finicky every time you use it. I don't want to discourage you from this brewer as it is a terrific brewer but I would advise you to also pick up an after market mesh or cloth filter. I would recommend a glass filter but I have tried a few glass filters in my siphons and I tend to get alot of sediment.The new filter will allow you to use a finer grind and never have to worry if it is going to kick down completely or not.
4,Makes a good cup of Jo !!,I don't drink a lot of coffee but when I do I want it to be the best !! this does that for me and it makes it seem like a treat. I'ts fun for the whole family to watch. If I were a serious coffee drinker you know the type that drinks 2 pots before 8am this probably isn't for you just stick with your Mr. Coffee....
5,Stylish coffee brewer; aromatic coffee,The vacuum coffee maker is not that difficult to use but takes practice to achieve best results. I am somewhat unsure of how much water to place in the lower vessel and what heat setting to use. The instructions and tips found on Amazon and coffee related sites are helpful in achieving the best cuppa. I won't use the machine for daily brewing as I fear I will break the glass too easily. It is a very attractive pot that makes great coffee.
2,bodum santos stovetop 34oz.,"Compared to my smaller and much older ABCO stovetop pot, this is thin glass (I had expected a thicker body), slow, not user friendly. The wire coil catch on the bottom tube tends to pop off. The handle is light weight. Using the same grind as for the other pot, this one tends to plug up and not flow through. The design is not efficient. The coffee flavor was okay."
3,"Great coffee, great theater, but....","I remember my parents making 'vacuum' coffee when I was a kid, and even inherited their pot, which was stainless steel. It made great coffee, and the stainless was effortless to use and clean. So, I was delighted when I found this beautiful coffeemaker. I used it twice, with wonderful results, though the glass did make me nervous. On the third use, the lower pot cracked. Nowhere in the documentation that came with the pot did it say to use a diffuser, which I'll admit surprised me. Hopefully they've corrected this error, so new users don't suffer the same fate.Now I'd really like to find a replacement lower pot that didn't cost as much as the whole set!In general this makes wonderful coffee and is great fun to watch, but I agree that it's not an every-morning type of pot."
5,A great cup of coffee,"This isn't just a fun, visual coffeemaker -- it produces what could very well be the best coffee next to French press. It looks like something you'll find in a chemistry lab, and that's part of the appeal. Sure, maybe it requires a little more effort to clean, but unless you use it everyday, it's no big hassle. I have both the stovetop and electric Santos coffeemakers, and I prefer this one more. If you really like coffee, go ahead and give the Mr. Coffee unit a rest for a bit and try this one."
3,"So-so coffee, but parts are melting","I received this coffee maker in Dec. 2000, have used it approx. 30-40 times. The coffee comes out okay, not great; I prefer a drip coffee maker or real percolated coffee. Also, the coffee doesn't stay warm so if you want hot coffee, you must drink it immediately; nuke your second cup. The black handle on the coffee pot has started to melt, as well as the black rubber stopper that fits around the neck."
2,disappointed,The Santos does not equal the Bodum electric vacuum pot. The filter is inadequate and requires only the coarsest of grinds which are often not available in store grinders and never in the home grinders. The handle is flimsy and makes it tricky to remove the pot from the heating element. I heartily suggest purchasing a small electric vacuum Bodum pot instead (if you can find one) or the 12 cup electric Bodum.
5,"Excellent coffee, ritual brewing","If you have never had the experience of brewing coffee with one of these pots, buy one today and you are in for an experience. Making coffee has become wonderful 5-10 minute ritual now and this pot provides an excellent visual experience. Of course, it doesn't stop there... once you taste the coffee you've just brewed, you'll never go back to droo...er..drip coffee.This is the BEST 'tranditional' brewed coffee pot I've ever owned and I will NEVER go back to drop, press, etc... Combined with my Pasquini Livia 90 espresso machine and bodum press tea pot, there is little any coffee house can offer that I can't do better at home!"
2,waste of money,"spend your precious cash elsewhere. this item will languish for 99% of it's life. get a nice french press or stovetop espresso maker instead. looks fancy, coffee is mediocre. not worth the money."
1,USED,I'm not sure how well this coffeemaker works. I purchased one from Amazon and received one that was obviously in used condition. The glass was water stained and not factory packaged. There wasn't a manual or any instructions. 1 star for Amazon on this one.
1,Classic Bait & Switch,"This item was listed on the Bizrate.com site, as being available from Amazon.com as a 12 cup electric coffee maker. When it arrived, I was dismayed to discover it was only 8 cups (and remember, that's those teeny weeny French cups) and a manual maker.It went right back to Amazon. Not anywhere near worth the $49.00I initially paid for it!"
5,Best Method to Brew Coffee!,"I have made my second batch of coffee from the Bodum Santos Coffee Maker and rate it an absolute 10! I have used every type of coffee maker available in the past but this is my favorite method--the vacuum system produces the fullest flavor, no grounds or residue, and it is the easiest to clean, just two glass containers that can be rinsed out. Since purchasing this absolute gem of a coffee brewer, made in Copenhagen, Denmark, I have turned into more of a coffee lover than ever (don't know what this will do to my health). It tastes just like an expensive cup full from Starbucks at a fraction of the price. It is so much fun to watch the brewing process, seeing the water rush up the glass pipe into the upper container where the coffee grounds lie in anticipation of being covered by boiling water which brings out the full flavor, then the coffee descends to the lower container, and, voila!, ready to drink and thoroughly savor."
5,the best!,"I love my coffee maker! Bodum does not make the 12 cup electric coffee maker I previously had, so when I found this one I was happy to try it. I am very satisfied with it."
5,I love this coffee maker,"Better not be in a hurry for your freshly brewed coffee, prepared with the Santos Coffee Maker.It is like a ceremony:Water into the pot, coffee into the filter.Put pieces together, set on hot stove.Watch the water slowly being pushed out of the pot into the filter.Remove pot from heat and watch the coffee drop back into the pot.Enjoy coffee!A refreshing and relaxing part of my otherwise hectic life."
4,Wonderful,"I purchased this for my mother for her birthday, she's a big french press fan and I had heard that this was similar but better. It makes wonderful coffee, far superior to a drip machine, but it takes a little more work than a french press, so my mother now uses it maybe once a week while I use it almost daily at the office.The filter that comes with it is sub par and needs to be replaced."
5,I don't normally drink coffee...,"It was my girlfriend that introduced me to this type of coffee maker. In the past, I really didn't enjoy coffee, as the taste was too bitter. But somehow the coffee the glass vacuum makes tastes more flavorful. Wher her old glass one cracked due to an accident, I checked all the local stores to find a replacement. After no results, I turned to Amazon. Sure it is a bit pricey, but it is a far superior product compared to filter makers."
5,Best coffee ever!,"When I was a youngster,1950's, I remember watching in amazement when a family friend made coffee with a vacuum coffee maker. When I bought my Bodum it was like being a kid again. It is always fun to watch and it makes the best coffee I have ever had! Buy one, you'll love it!"
4,Brewing coffee is now an artform,"Brews a great cup of coffee. My only worry is the filter which uses a metal spring to hold it down to filter the coffee. My filter's is losing it's tension and I can't get a replacement for it at [website](everything except the unnecessary stand is out of stock since Christmas of last year 2001). If you can't bother to figure things out, do not buy this. =0) Here's a tip though. Bring the water a good hot boil then put the top part on with the coffe. If you put the top part on too early you will get a weak cup of coffee that soon gets cold. Also don't get scared of letting the water steep in the top part for a good minute or two before turning the flame off.Overall, a very good value especially considering the price of other vacuum coffee makers including their electric [price]"
4,Take care on gas stove,"I enjoy this coffee brewer. As I recall the original of this type was a Silex which came out after WWII with Pyrex glass. My only problem is that I have broken 2 carafes on my gas stove as I did not use a diffuser as recommended, and got distracted surfing the web or some such. Am about to order the electronic version for trial due to my attention deficit in coffee brewing."
3,Tips over too easy,"Narrow base can easily be tipped over...end result broken top unit. other than that makes good coffee 90% of the time, other 10% the grinds get clogged in the filter."
2,"fussy process, delicate glass, mediocre coffee","I'm ok with putting effort into making a great cup of coffee... but the Santos doesn't give much back after all the care and attention you have to shower on it. I still don't like the idea that an inch of water doesn't even get brewed with the coffee because it has to stay at the bottom to keep the glass from cracking. Not only that, but you are left with 2 delicate glass bowls to clean afterwards, instead of just 1.At the end of the day, I'm much happier with my Bialetti moka pot or just an old fashioned percolator.This product was a HUGE dissapointment after reading all the glowing reviews on here. I think I was a victim of cognitive dissonance."
4,Bodum coffee maker,"Wonderful coffee. The only drawback is it only brews two large cups at a time. Otherwise, if you have the time in the morning, it's great."
2,replacement impossible,"I've had my santos for two years, and once the funnel broke, I haven't been able to use it since. It's been impossible to replace, which is a shame. It was fun to work with, although the coffee wasn't particularly exceptional. Still looking for a new funnel."
2,IT BROKE,"I have had this product for almost a month now and love it, however....while cleaning out the top globe tonight it broke. Right where the logo is printed on it completely broke out in a circle! No bueno! Now what?"
4,A useful adictional tool for FX traders,"Beyond the technical analisys, the FX trader must understand the macro movers of a country exchange rate. The economic movers are very important on the medium-long term investing. This book help you to understand those indicators."
1,Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes,Worst product ever doesnot live up to sdds yellow hand and skin color marbled the number needed to use versus cost unrealistic. Very poor item I felt ripped off over this junk.
3,must agree with mr nelson,"This cd seems to not quite get it.Tommy is a fantastic blues guitar player.He has made great cd`s in exception to the rule and right as rain,but those were in the blues mode.I don`t want to hear a talent like this just trying to make you boogie,come on this guy is a great guitar player.Tommy please,stick to the blues."
2,not what i expected.,"I really liked all of tommy castro`s studio cd but this did not get it for me,because i like the blues side of him more.There is just to much soul in this cd.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR CASTRO AT HIS BEST GET CAN`T KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN.This cd does have its moments with a great version of a classic,my time after awhile."
3,"Nice Groove, but lets not go overboard!","This is my first Tommy CD. I liked the built in interview on the CD, and he seems nice. His band has a nice groove, and tunes are good. He's not a guitar God, and his voice is average. His band is good. In my book this CD is that. It's good. It's not excellent. I didn't call anyone telling them they ""Had to hear this CD"". I thought his version of ""Sex Machine"" didn't really add much from the original James Brown version (another reviewer mentioned it). Tommy sounds like he's having fun, and it comes through on the CD. It's just not ""Oh my God!"" awesome, and if you're looking for the next Stevie Ray, keep lookin."
1,Great machine if you get it from a reliable vendor,I've found these machines to be workhorses. Of course they're no longer in production and you have to purchase refurbished ones now. Do NOT order from Beatronics unless you intend to throw the money away. They promise a 90 day guarantee but DO NOT RESPOND if you have a problem. Avoid Beatronics if you value service.
1,Do not order from SUM Computers!!,"I ordered the HP LaserJet 4 from Sum Computers after reading some positive reviews about the printer. However, Sum Computers sent me a printer that does not work AT ALL. It has a paper jam problem, and after hours of research, I've concluded that the only way to fix it will be to order replacement parts and install them myself, IF I can find the correct parts for sale somewhere else.I am extremely frustrated with SUM Computers. After sending them a message asking for a refund they sent me a strange and short message ignoring my request for a refund.Be careful when buying used items. I'll probably never buy a used item like this again. Hopefully other sellers sell better products."
4,a practical college guide book,"This book is strongly recommended to those who have almost no idea of applying for colleges. It contains almost everything throughout the whole process you will encounter. NOTE: this book is designed mainly for general white american citizens or green card holders. If you are a minority or international student, there's not much information that is suitable for you."
3,Haven't finished yet,But I don't know if I will... it's definitely a book that has too much PRE information to givining birth and background on the writers. I really wanted something that cut to the chase but this book hasn't done it yet. I may not even finish it.
3,Very one sided,"I bought this book hoping to be educated on all of my options during birth. The bottom line is this book describes all options, but is pushing its readers to choose only natural births including home births. It positively discusses natural births over countless pages. However, when discussing western birth practices takes only a few pages and bashes the whole practice. Thankfully, I work as a health care provider and know the risks and benefits of western medicine birth practices and was able to make my own decisions when my birth occurred. I would be concerned if this were your only birthing educational reference."
3,There are more informative and up-to-date options,"This book was ok, but it's a bit dated (almost 20 years old) and was a bit too ""conversational"" and preachy for my taste. The Sears are clearly in favor of natural birth, and although they do present some information about interventions and when they might be warranted, this is not the book for you if you aren't at least considering an unmedicated birth. Although I generally agree with the philosophy of this book, I was looking for something with a more factual and balanced tone. I much preferred ""Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn"" by Penny Simkin, which provided more information and was backed up with recent research."
5,EXCELLENT,"I read this book before I had my baby, which is what you should do! It was an excellent resource for mothers who wish to have the most satisfying birth possible! William Sears wants women to know that their bodies are MADE to give birth, and if you follow your instincts, and do what you feel is best, you can have the birth that you would have never expected could be so good! My first child came after 7.5 hrs of labor, 20 minutes of pushing, and NO epidural! I did the breathing that I learned in birthing classes, and followed my instincts about what felt good. When you follow your instincts, your birth can be as satisfying as mine! He also talks about times when labor cannot go as planned, and different types of drugs used to ease the pain. VERY EXCELLENT resourse, I recommend this for EVERY pregnant woman!"
5,Excellent Read!,"This is one of the best birth books we have come across! There are many different philosophies to child birth, and while Sears does have his own opinion, he provides information regarding all your birth choices in an accurate and non-judgemental way. I would recommend this book regardless of the birthing style you are wishing to pursue, as this book will give you honest, complete, and accurate information about all your choices."
2,NOT SATISFYING READING,"I feel that many of the comments are to tell you the author's ideas, I would like to see more ways to feel good about a birth. Please read other books too! This does not give alternatives and that is very important. Not enough productive material included and satisfying to this reader."
2,MAKING TOO MANY JUDGEMENTS OF OTHERS,"It is fine to discuss other methods but not to be totally down on all others!! Yes, other ways are effective also and the author does not know everything as indicated. Alernatives are important too and should be discussed in a reasonable manner and not just with a one sided approach. TX reader"
4,"Very good, but glossed over some complications","with the interventions. I preferred the ""Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth"" which highlighted many of the risks involved with each intervention. But this book went over many of the regular treatments found in a hospital birth. Overall, well written & excellent information."
3,Helpful - but a bit old,"I'm not sure if it was just the edition that I had shipped to me or the book itself. But, I found that some of the thoughts were a little out-dated. In spite of that, it was still very informative and helpful. I love the other books I have from the Sears. I like that the book is easy to use so you don't have to read cover-to-cover."
4,Excellent Information - a little biased,"I decided to wait until after I had my baby to review this book so I was speaking from experience as to whether it was helpful or not!Overall I found this book useful and it has excellent detailed information about the birth process, drugs, interventions & womens choices during labour. I knew exactly what was happening to me & my baby during labour and I understood all of the options available to me and their potential knock on effects.Like many of the other reviewers I found a strong bias toward a natural birth and had to take the facts at face value and ignore the authors personal preferences.I also found the countless references to Martha's 'wonderful' birth experiences condescending and they started to annoy me after a while."
5,Fantastic,"My husband and I plan to use the Hypnobirthing method for our baby girl due Jan 2008. Since you can never plan your birth and everyone is different I wanted to know a general overview of all the other things I could encounter while in labor. This book is FANTASTIC. It's not negative, just the facts. I find I can't put it down. There are so many pregnancy related books out there that have a negative feel to them and this book isn't one of them. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I love this book."
4,Sound advice,"I was anticipating that natural childbirth methods would be the only method discussed in this book, but have been pleasantly surprised to learn about different pain relief options during labor and delivery. The authors lay out the pros and cons of medication, fetal monitoring, and other such ""interventions"" without making me feel like a bad person for possibly wanting an epidural! They discuss practical birthing positions and exercises that you can do pre-birth to prepare your body for the marathon of birth."
3,"Informative, but negative","I bought this book because I am on bedrest and cannot attend birthing classes. It includes a lot of information, but I found the overall tone to be very negative on the present-day birth practices. It was extremely opinionated, skewed heavily to the authors' experiences, which made me a little turned off."
5,Great read!,Strongly recommended...I learned so much from this book about labor and the birth process. I strongly recommend this book to couples regardless of whether it is your first or your a pro;). Very informative.
2,Should not be your only guide!,"This was the first birthing book I read and frankly it scared me silly about all medical intervention. The book contains lots of useful and interesting information but is very one sided. I think it is important to read other books also that are more open to the potential advantages of medical intervention in birth, otherwise if the doctor or midwife recommends a particular course of action, it will induce fear of potential consequences.I found the authors quite santimonious from time to time and the guilt element comes through loud and clear.In summary, some good information but all from one side of the fence so make sure you read other books too."
5,Comprehensive and thourough,I thought this book gave both sides of issues so you could make an informed decision. It was a necessity for me in my first pregnancy. I loved it!
2,Out of date,"I was excited to read this book given all the good reviews it received. Unfortunately I was disappointed by it. It definitely has a natural childbirth slant, which would be OK if it accurately discussed other alternatives such as pain medications. I found some of the information regarding pain medications for childbirth was out of date or (hopefully not intentionally) misleading. For example, the book states that women who have an epidural are twice as likely to have either forceps or vacuum extraction. This is just not true. The information regarding Lamaze is also out of date. Keep in mind this book was published in 1994, a lot can change in 13 (+) years! It does have some useful basic information about labor and comfort techniques but overall I found it to be very biased and, like I've already written, just plain out of date. I highly recommend ""Easy Labor"" by William Camann and Kathryn Alexander as an unbiased, researched, highly readable, and recently published (2006!) alternative."
3,"more ""liberal"" than most....","Dr Sears is a bit more ""liberal"" than most doctors and although I don't agree with everything he says, I liked the information he gave in this book. It helped ease some anxiety for me, especially since Lamaze wasn't offered at my hospital. He prefers a more natural birth, and discussed a lot of the complications and drawbacks to induction, medication, ect. I was induced and was very nervous because of what I had read in this book. My daughter was very healthy at birth, and continues to be, 9 mo. later!"
2,The Birth Book,"I am greatly disappointed by this book. While it does provide a great deal of valuable informaion about all types of birthing styles and options available to birthing mothers, there is a strong tendency of the authors to be quite negative toward the main-stream hospital birth with an OBGYN. It is quite evident that the authors feel that all natural, even home delivery is the best way to go. As an expecting mother, I find this infomation and how it is presented to be condesending and full of guilt/shame for those of us not interested in the ""all-natural"" delivery. I feel that a more objective approach would be more helpful. Furthermore, the other books by Sears, MD and Sears, RN are much the same way. If you are even thinking you might breast and bottle feed...don't bother reading their breastfeeding book...you'll just feel guilty and bad if you don't succeed with their way."
3,"Quite interesting to read, but expected more details","I got this book after becoming somewhat tree-huggish during the pregnancy. I did some research online and this book poped up as a guide to natural childbirth. It definitely encourages going natural. All the way.As some other reviewers, I do find this book one sided. I mean, if you mention 100 times - you don't have to feel bad about having a c-section, you start thinking: wait a minute, why do they say that so often? I found it a little annoying.I'm sure that this couple has a lot of experience, and most of the information is helpful, but I also read most of it online, while searching for a more detailed book.It covers the basics, explains how natural childbirth is different that ""hospital"" one, but does not give you a set of skills you could really use during your labor."
5,Helpful,As with all of these types of books certain areas are focused on more than others and some things are completely missing but in general this one was a good read and very helpful.
1,Judas Iscariot,I we were living in the days ofJesus and Judas iscariot write a book; critizes Jesus you will by it?
1,Thsi Book is not ture,"I have a probelm with this book because JW's do beleive in Jesus. This autor should research before he writes. There are a number of misconceptions in this book and if someone reads the bible front to back, no matter what verson, they are all the same. This is not a book I wouold recomend for someone to read."
1,Answering Jehovah's witnesses,"Well,I think Mr reed is trying to create a business for himself as little hev writes is relative to the reality of J/W's. Come on Mr reed you know they believe in Jesus. And Chrismas,Easter...its a matter of historythey were syncrotised from non christian beliefs.Trinity teaching too. Ever read the history of Arius and Athanasius and the Nicene Council? They care less what Bible you use...I challenged them and they are good at all versions. I never found anyone of them who coul;dn't talk on one subject,stasy there,and make very important points to think on. If Mr reeds book were fiction I give it one of the greatest reports ever...but its not."
1,Judge a book by its cover.,This book is obviously prejudiced in the same way the some of the Witnesses books are prejudiced. If you want to share your views about religious groups so as to help people change then you should acknowledge the good things about the religion that appealed to these people.And don't send mispelled messages as if all Jehovah's Witnesses are illiterate. That is stupid and low.
4,Great product. Installation isn't straightforward.,"Unless your a homemaking hobbyist or pro, you'll probably want to buy the installation kit (not included, but can be purchased separately by the same company). Without the installation kit . . . 3 stars, with installation kit 5 stars. Average = 4."
4,Good stuff,"This is a real good solution for many things. We have a huge window right over our master tub - with a neighbor next door. Kind of hard to think about taking a nice private bath - right!? So as long as you have a razor knife, some water in a spray bottle and a decent sense of measure - you are set. It solved a problem for us. I went outside to see if you could see through it - and you can't!!! Recommend this as a problem solver for sure."
4,Bob Dylan Who?,"After all the hoo-hah abouot most people only care about the new Dylan song, I must say that there are many other good reasons to listen to this soundtrack. I always enjoy thematic stuff, and so there's the song from ""Cabaret,"" Liza singing ""Maybe this time,"" and my own personal favorite, George Jones (who can do no wrong!) singing ""I always get lucky with you."" I bought the soundtrack for that cut alone. But, yes, Mr. Dylan's was also much appreciated. I don't see how anyone could go wrong with this whole album!"
5,What a CD!,"I had a very similar experience to the reviewer above. One morning, on my way to work, I was listening to my favorite jazz station when a very unusual and seductive rendition of TAKE THE 'A' TRAIN came on that I had never heard before. Wow! I got on the phone immediately at the end of the tune and called to get the musician's name, which of course, turned out to be Ray Armando. I highly recommend this CD -- it's a real joy!"
1,Horror Within is right - it is honorable.,"Oh my gosh - one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Poor B rated - crappy effects and I think they used an iPhone to record the sound. The FX looked like some 80's TV show, well I hate to put down 80's TV shows now that I think about it. OK, they were worse than that. So - so story, but that is it. Nothing much to say except don't waste your money and don't be fooled by the cool looking movie poster. You know, there is a reason there is no preview with this one... Oh yea, and don't even ask me about the Wear-Monkey in the movie. Got to go wash my eyes after that one."
1,Old Product,The book had yellowed pages and I was embarrased to give it as a gift. I expected that it had been protected from aging. Oh well.
3,Laura's prairie wisdom-buy hard book,"I love anything Laura Ingalls Wilder. Her wisdom and wit are timeless. This book is a collection of saying from her writings. However, the editor did a very bad job. With some pages the print is so small it is hard to read. On others the print is very large. Either way you can not change the text size or line spacing.For the wit & wisdom this book is tops. For it's construction on e-book it is lousy. My suggestion is to buy the hard book."
5,Love this watch!!,"To me, this is THE classic Diver's Watch. I've been wearing the essentially the same model watch for the past 15 years and decided to treat myself to a new one. It's durable, looks and runs great, and it's highly affordable."
4,citizen watch,"The first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.To amazons credit,they sent me a new one right away.This watch is fine.I needed a rubber band because I am in water a great deal of the time at workand I live near the ocean.I am always in the water with my children.So far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.No problems except when the first one was shipped broken.I would buy it again."
4,Great dive watch and good for everyday use,"It's hard to find a watch that you can wear every day and take diving, but this one is perfect. I've had mine for ten years, and it's taken a massive amount of abuse. A slight scratch on the glass is all it has to show for it. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that setting the date is really fiddly."
2,Citizen Men's AJO100-02E Professional Divers Watch,I like the watch but the change day function was faulty and so am unable to set the correct day
1,worthless pos,This inverter never worked right. Lasted about two months with very sporadic use by me. Beware the Nieko Tools USA have no warranty as far as i can tell. I can not find any contact info and the seller will not answer phone. The seller is Die Cast Model Madness or DCMM. Amazon offers no help at all. Just $200 dollars spent on worthless ChInese junk.
1,confusion and disappointment,"I think I'm disappointed in product and what bothers me even more is that the seller didn't respond to my email. I will not rate the product because i simply don't know anything about it. I can only describe what i experienced. When i plugged in an electric kettle which needs 1500w all that i see on the watts output display is some lousy 310watts produced by inverter (rated for 2000w/4000w peak surge) so you tell me please how should i rate it. To the seller ""Green's garage"" i give zero for unprofessional approach."
1,You get what you pay for,I ordered these cups to go with another item that I was purchasing to create a gift basket. These cups are total junk! I received them and they were all chipped and scratched. The coating on them was blotchy and uneven and the logo was not straight and was scratched. Waste of money (even if they were cheap)
5,A Truly Pleasing Adventure,"I was not expecting much from this movie based mostly on the cover, but I was clearly wrong. The relationships are deep and well written, leading anyone to remember having been blessed with such good friendships. There is mostly clean family entertainment on a genuine level, and the messages of making the most of life and being true to yourself are both good ones that will resonate with most audiences. The music is also great and fitting, not something that can always be said for Hindi films. I highly recommend buying this touching movie to watch again and again."
3,Sometimes entertaining,"Although this film was sometimes entertaining, it did not hold my attention. Mostly I thought it silly. It was filmed very well, and I thought the scenery was beautiful. I enjoyed the sky-divig scenes the best. I would speculate that Hrithik Roshan will keep having a very sucessful career."
1,Snooze Fest,"I fail to understand how this film earned such high reviews from the very few folks who shared their thoughts. It's nothing but a snooze fest. The only redeeming aspect of the film is the beautiful scenery that is Spain. Otherwise, Indian actors (male) seriously need to come to terms with the fact that they either spend time building and flexing their muscles or going to acting school and taking acting seriously as a profession. I am indeed a Bollywood fan but a very critical one at that. A ten year old child could have done a better job writing the dialogue. And as far as acting goes? It breaks my heart to even go there;I am not likely to contain myself. Do yourselves a huge favor and rent it for the scenic locations. These actors were not making a movie with a story grounded in depth and substance; they went on a long vacation instead and got paid handsomely for it. Total waste of time."
5,The cover is deceiving,"It's too bad they made the cover for this movie a piece of eye candy. It's a thoughtful film about the universal journey to authenticity. It has the added bonus, for those of us who haven't spent much time outside the US, of showing the countryside and culture of another country (in this case, surprisingly, as much Spain as India). It's a feel good film, and I feel good recommending it."
5,Such a good movie,"This movie has light humor, deep meaning, and a great adventure. Very different Indian movie I would highly recommend watching"
4,Its a power cord,It is as advertised. There is not much to be said for this. I got what I wanted. Thank you
3,Bought this book for Women's Studies course,I have learned a lot from this book. I purchased it as required reading for my women's studies course. So far it has been a good read.
2,Broke within first 2 months!,I bought this thinking it looked sturdy...but ya get what ya pay for! Flimsy wood and one of the panels popped out within the first 2 months of use leaving a unusable feeder. Fixed it myself but I should not have had to! Very cheaply built...don't plan on it lasting long!
1,piece of junk,Looks great in the picture. That is where it ends. Put together very bad. Parts broken and missing. Would not buy again.
1,"Cheap, and keep browsing, this is a real joke!!","I was so upset by this ill made bird house that I bought as a Christmas present for my dad. The wood was broken off and it is not for real usage, more just to look at and wonder why you wasted your money. I ordered a replacement and it arrived yesterday in worse condition that the first one!! Upset is an understatement. It was not wrapped in plastic, it looked as if I was sent someone else's return. What a joke, NEVER again!!"
1,Birdscapes 50172 Mountain Chapel,The bird feeder arrived packaged poorly. There were multiple splinters coming off the wood. The post were falling apart so I glued them. Overall I am disappointed this product. Poor quality.
2,Badly Made,It's very pretty - especially on screen - but it is very badly made and it seems very cheap. I will be returning it.
4,Very useful,This book has lots of easy to follow recipes with usable type things. I was pretty happy with the book and used it lots.
5,The best pop song in history!!!!!!!!!!!,"Westlife have done it again! This one is another smash hit from the brilliant Irish band, Westlife. It's catchy, smooth and it makes you smile! Also the B-side track called Try Again is a corker!! Hear it and weep. I promise you won't be disappointed. These five lads from Ireland will sing their way straight to your heart and all you gotta do is surrender and sing along!!"
5,it sooo beautiful that I HAVE NO WORDS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ITS THE MOST BEATUTIFUL BAND IVE EVER HEARD OF AND IT GOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONGS EVER I DONT EVEN HAVE WORDS.ITS FABULOUS !!!! I LOVE WESTLIFE I DETICATED A SONG TO THE GUY WHO I LOVE AND HE IS MY BOY FRIEND NOW
5,Playing at marriage,"This book is deceptively simple. The narrative voice alternates between Shoko, the wife, and Mutsuki, the husband. Shoko and Mutsuki have a marriage of convenience so they can quiet the demands of their parents and present a ""normal"" front to the outside world. Actually, Shoko is a depressed alcholic and Mutsuki is homosexual. Shoko is on good terms with his lover, Kon, and their friends, so the marriage seems to be working, but not without complications.This book had me crying, not because their problems are so dire, but because the author does so well at conveying their pain. The story was so involving that I want to help Shoko find a pschiatrist that will take her serious. Mutsuki is such a nice guy that as ""marriages of convenience"" go, he is a real catch."
5,normal-bizarre love triangle,"I just saw Ms. Kaori Ekuni interviewed and reading at an Author's Festival in Toronto Canada, and was mesmerized by her book and message. She is a pretty woman who is not as shy as her voice makes her out.Not only is Ms. Ekuni a charming woman who knows how to say what she thinks succinctly, she is saying very important things. Like, ""there is not such thing as a normal romance,"" and ""falling in love is foolhardy"". I hope people aren't turned off by the inclusion of gay characters who choose to live normalized married lives, because the fact of the matter is that it happens, and it bothers fewer people that way.Don't expect thrilling action or melodrama in this book. Twinkle Twinkle is about manners, and about how everyone has their psychological mis-balance, like Shoko, the girl; or feels the need to hide something natural to them, like Mutsuki, the boy.Twinkle Twinkle tells it like it is, and then breaks down what has always been a mystery to readers - love."
5,Golden Girls,I have bought all of them for my Daughter who is now a teacher in a local high school. She watches them every week. Can't wait for the next season to come out.
5,Golden Girls Intimate Portrait,"Who doesn't love the Golden Girls? I have loved this show from the first time my Mom and I watched it together. This show is definitely a classic. I have purchased this Intimate Portrait plus all seven seasons, and I just can't pick a favorite. From the first episode to the last, I lived, loved, and laughed with these Golden ladies."
4,Lots of Info on the Golden Girls Stars,"Pretty good if you're interested in learning about the personal lives of the women who starred as ""The Golden Girls."" Mostly fluff, but entertaining."
4,fun - but why?,"a fun CD . . . but why buy the ""summary of the Golden Girls"" when you can buy the original DVD's and enjoy the entire story lines from each show?"
4,Very interesting,"Everything I wanted to know about each Golden Girl is in this interesting DVD. For instance, I din't know anything about Estelle Getty's long career in the theater before her role as Sophia. And I din't know Rue had been married so many times ;o) And what about Bea Arthur, my favorite Golden Girl. She is such a talented actress and I din't know she had been a lab technician before becoming the great actress we all love. And I also din't know Betty White had been married twice before marrying the love of her life: Allen Ludden. All in all, the four of them were absolutely great in ""The Golden Girls"" and I intend to buy all the DVD's."
5,Beautiful DVD with the four touching histories,"My best recommedation to buy this item, interesting and touching."
4,Civilization Past and Present is an eye opener!,with so many tiny tidbits of interesting information stuck in here and there it was a learning experience just reading the special highlights throughout the book. There were useful lists of important dates and happenings throughout each chapter and even suggested websites relating to each chapter's material for further information. The way the book was written made for easy understanding of the material and better memory of what was read. Although the book follows a text book formula it was fun to read which is rare. A real find!
5,Amazing,"The new Rockfords album is nothing short of amazing. I was sceptical at first but purchased it anyway because Mike McCready was on it. All the songs are top notch, filled with brilliant guitar riffs and superb vocals. If you are a McCready fan, or a fan of music, I suggest you check it out."
1,The Rockfords,"I bought this blindly after hearing ""Silver Lining"". Love that song. This may be their one hit wonder. The other songs don't compare. I find my self repeating that song and skipping all the others."
4,A Miracle Movie,"Ed Harris and Anne Heche are both great actors in this movie. Ed Harris plays a priest that is second guessing his calling in life. In the meantime he is sent to inspect a small church where miracles are happening, a very good plot. Anne plays the daughter of the woman that is the reason these miracles are happening. Of course there is the typical priest having temptations of the flesh, which I suppose is not needed. The ending is lacking some, but all in all, the movie is very good."
2,Did I miss something?,"I was intrigued throughout most of this movie and, like everyone else, appreciated the ""ah ha"" moment near the end; but, I think I missed something at the very end. I turned my head to pour myself a drink (looking very forward to seeing how this whole plot would come together) and when I looked back, the credits were rolling! I rewound the movie to see what I missed and still can't figure out what we're supposed to surmise. I would give this a 5 star rating if there had been at least another minute or two to let us know the ending!"
1,"VERY, VERY WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!",You would have to be VERY OFFISDE to enjoy this movie!!!! I turned it off after 20 minutes.Don't waste your time or money on this.
5,Excellent experience!,Seller is Awsome! I received my purchase as promised and in perfect condition. I will buy from this seller as often as possible.
5,More than just 3 miracles.,"Excellent movie, which I finally ordered after seeing it about 10 years ago. Several stories going on at once, a good mystery as well as a drama, love story, and look into organized religion behind the scenes. I have recommended to several catholic friends, and they all love it. Ed Harris is a wonderful actor. He is also great in Radio, another sleeper movie that never got the attention it deserved."
2,Not Thunderpuss' best work...,"I was eagerly awaiting this CD...unfortunately, it disappoints. The Thunderpuss mixes are OK...and that's about it. Being a big fan of their work (even if some accuse it of being formulaic), their style certainly does make for some highly danceable grooves. This one is not one of them. Kim English has some good vocals, but the track could have used a harder edge, rather than their usual, ""softer"" synth style. Oh well...can't hit a home run every time..."
5,Works great!,"Red residue everywhere? Well of course you're supposed to decorate on top of wax paper or newspaper! I love all these color mists. They're so easy to use and give off a very nice look. For darker colors spray close, for lighter colors spray farther way. Be smart and decorate on top of your kitchen table using newspapers underneath :]"
2,Red Everywhere!,"I love the concept of the color mist. I purchased 3 bottles of the red mist to decorate 75 cupcakes. The mist went on very easy, but because I wanted a darker red I had to keep applying it. To say the least, I am not a big fan right now ... since my kitchen now has a red residue all over the counter tops! :-("
4,The plot thickens,"This book picks up right where the first left off and continues to build an interesting and suspenseful storyline. The immortals play an even greater role in this one and Mat-hew, Zhora, and Khardan are caught up in the plots of an evil god and find themselves in a position to influence the future of their entire world. The secret of the two magical fish in a ball is uncovered and Quar's minions continue to conquer the world.A highly entertaining read."
5,Wonderful dried cherries!,I first had dried cherries in a salad while in Michigan. This addition to a salad certainly kicks it up a notch or two and Klein's is the best!
2,Herbal Remedy,"I've been giving this product to my dog for about 1 month now along with the recommended other supplement Arthisoothe. I have to say, I really don't see any improvement in him. He is a 3 year old Collie that had an injury at 15 months that has caused him some early problems with arthritis. I was hoping he would do better on this stuff, but so far, he is not. Since I bought a big bottle of it, I will continue with it until they are gone just to see if there is improvement after some more time has gone by."
5,I Just picked it up,I heard about this book from my friends cailin ang kelli and they let me barrow it. I started reading it and couldent put it down the way the arthur write grabs you sucks you in to this world of flight 007. Ive purchased a copy and another one as a gift for my mother its a good book for anyone to read
5,[Sheild blaster 3000 ROCKS!],Well I never owned one I saw some people with it it rules over soaker tag evan. I got in a soaker war today everyone but me had sheild blasters. I was soaked. I used MAXIMUM DISTANSE 6000 I then more than ever waunted one. I recomened it because it has awsome defence against moabable opponets. It teaches you precice aim. Where to block and all that.
2,Sheild Blaster not that great,"We purchased this water toy, and my son who is 10 finds it very heavy to wear and turn the crank when filled. While I find it easy to turn the crank, my hand will not even fit into the ""handle"" and causes pain. Additionally, I was disatisfied with the fact that the water leaks out when you hold it with the nozzles facing down.(...)"
5,Awsum block!,"This is a realy great gun! I used this at a squirt gun fight fight and this gun ruled! The sheild is tough a big for blockin water balloons and other guns! You have to spin a crank clockwise to shoot and dont even have to pump! If you could move the sheild in front of you while shooting, you'd be invincible! Its got single, double, and triple nozzle action! I highly recommend this!"
5,loved it,"Liked this book very much as I am familiar with the area it describes and it made me feel like I was right there. Good writing, a good mystery, I'll write anything this author writes!"
2,Forced and Monotonous,"I debated whether to give this one or two stars, and settled on two as I definitely didn't ""hate"" it, but surely didn't like it. Although the setting and story line initially intrigued me, my interest petered-out quickly as I realized the writing was monotonous; the sentence structure rarely varied and the use of dialogue, although a strong point of his writing, was just too much. The repetition of events through multiple conversations left me rather bored and feeling as though I could skim too many pages. I found the plot line forced and lacking originality. The ending was quick and left me feeling like there really wasn't a conclusion. With that, I'm not one to stop short of what I started, especially when it comes to books. I'll steer clear of any of Stander's upcoming novels."
3,Just Ok.,"I enjoyed that the setting was Michigan, but otherwise, the story didn't flow well at all. It was good for a free book..."
3,where was the real ending?,"Some of the plot was hard to follow. Then at the end of the book, he just gives up on the murders and there is no real ending. I read the entire book, only for there to be no real ending. Big disappointment!"
3,Ambiguous ending,"I enjoyed the book very much up until the last few pages. There I discovered that there was indeed a possible motive for the murders; there was indeed a possible murder suspect for ONE of the murders; but was no plausible murder suspect for the other three. How the suspect for the one murder could have possibly committed the other three is left totally unexplained or even speculated upon. The book ends with the Sheriff saying, ""Well, there is no statute of limitations on murder."" Does that mean Mr. Stander will answer these questions and solve these murders in a future book? I guess I like my murder mysteries tied up in neat little packages, and this book did not do that for me. Mr. Stander's second mystery, COLOR TOUR, is much, much better, in my opinion. Of course I could be wrong! :)"
2,No Resolution,"As others have said, it only cost $0.99. I shouldn't have expected much. It is a piece of amateur writing that feels forced at times and lacks a consistent flow. It's plot seemed unrealistic for a small town. I don't even know where to start with the ending other than to say there is no resolution to the story. I was wholly disappointed."
3,worth the 99 cents,"Tired phrase ""you get what you pay for"", but maybe that's why this book was only a dollar. The writer has good skills, developing and moving the plot along, but [spoiler alert], this is a mystery with NO crime solution. Do editors read books or do they just read synopses of books?"
2,Just didn't catch,"The story was just interesting enough to keep me reading until the end, but not interesting enough to be a ""keeper"" for me. Some of the characters seemed not to help the story line. Not a favorite of mine."
2,Disappointing,I bought all four of the books in the series and after reading the first Summer People I wish i had waited because i am not sure i would have purchased the other three. Story line is disjointed and the ending is terrible. I would not recommend this book at all and I think at .99 it was maybe overpriced. I am going to plow on through the others and hope for improvement.
3,I enjoyed this mystery,"I really enjoyed this mystery. I quickly learned to really like Sheriff Elkins and his associate, Sue. I thought it was very well written. Now, the ending was strange that's for sure. It certainly was not wrapped up how I would have liked it, but that said, I still enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one."
2,"In my opinion, not very good","This book was ok but the ending really leaves too many questions. There are several typos throughout. The writing is elementary. I found myself rolling my eyes at some parts. Even at no charge, I would not recommend spending time reading this."
3,WHAT HAPPENED HERE?,"While the book was an OK read, what happened to the ending???? It just stopped! ! ! ! ! I thought I was missing some pages, but don't think that was the issue. I just to know what happened."
1,What happened to the ending?,"I bought this book primarily because I love mysteries and because I am from Michigan.The read was a great read, suspenseful, and definately had me turning the page, wanting to findout what happens. I finished the book this morning on my commute and the books just ends!!! there is no wrap up, the mystery is never solved, its as if the writer just gave up, or didnt want to get into the nitty gritty of solving the crime.Very disappointed!!!"
4,Enjoyable mystery,"Aaron Stander has credible characters and a good mystery to solve in this book. I kept wanting to read it to see what happened. The ending was not what I expected, but I still think it was good. Definitely will read more of Mr. Stander's books"
5,Couldn't put it down!,I read this book in one day. I really enjoyed the characters and hope there are more books about them. I recommend it.
1,disappointed,The story went on and was too involved to end the way it did; I felt cheated by the ending.
3,Didn't Read the Whole Book,"Many on here complain about some books that are too ""preachy"" or ""christian"". They wish there was a way to warn them. Well, I'm the same way only towards the other way. I read the first few chapters of this book and found the language offensive, therefore, I didn't finish the book. If a book has offensive language, I don't want to waste my time reading it. If the devil's language is your cup of tea, I'll pray for you. We have become so immune to evil that we accept it as ok. I don't. I wish there was a more clear way to label books."
2,"Author has potential, but this is a waste of time.","Price aside, this offering is a waste of time. A lack of focus, people dropping dead, a poorly defined protagonist, too many names and personalities, and little pay-off. What is frustrating is that the author does have writing skills, and conveys comfortable dialogue. Best wishes to the author, but you need to focus your story telling."
2,Not worth the read,"The plot is ok, but with the authors constant jumping around in the plot makes it's difficult to follow. There is a large number of characters and the characters are not fully outlined so it makes it hard to remember who is who. I would guess there are over 50 characters in the book."
4,Really enjoyed this book!,"This is a book that most murder mystery fans will like. For the people who don't like swearing (there is one very brief scene but it fits) and sex scenes, you will be pleased to read this book. If you also like murder mysteries but don't care for the gory details you will also like this book.I can see why some people might not have liked the ending so much. I don't want to give it away but since I know this is a series I am assuming this investigation will come up again so it wasn't a downer for me. I liked the character development and thought it was well done. The story was also very good.I am pretty sure that I know who the murderer is but there is enough going on in the book to keep you guessing. Perhaps I will be surprised.Overall, I enjoyed this book very much & look forward to reading the rest of his books which I have already downloaded and am going to start reading this weekend."
1,I had no idea...,"I had no idea that a book could be written completely in quotations between characters, with no character development and no satisfying end and still get published. The storyline was great. Instead of being well-developed, it tries to follow too many different ideas, never allowing the reader to become interested in the fate of any of the characters."
3,good plot,Good plot but an empty ending. I was really disappointed with the ending I got all the way to the end and nothing.
1,Where's the end of the story?,"I never found this book very interesting and apparently the author didn't either because it simply stopped after awhile, with no real ending. The only saving grace was the occasional slice of life descriptions of life in northwest lower Michigan."
3,Left me wanting,"Enjoyed reading about Michigan, having lived in Traverse City for many years. I have never been this disapointed with a books ending. Could I get an alternative ending please??"
4,Enjoy the book!,"This is a fine book by an author who was new to me. I enjoyed reading ""Summer People"" and know others will as well, though it wasn't the right read for me."
2,Glad it was free!,"So glad this was a free download.... I forced myself to keep reading just to see ""who done it"" and the ending is terrible!"
3,"Decent, Easy Read","I enjoyed this book, but I would never claim that it should be a classic, must-read book. It was the kind of book I'd like to read when I'm sitting on one of the beaches in the area where the book takes place."
2,Not my favorite read,"I was not too impressed. I downloaded the next two books and am hoping to see an improvement. It feels like his next book is a bit better. Willing to keep at it as I love character development and love to follow characters and their stories. This first book took too many pit stops that did not mean much and left me wondering why they were in the book (his two friends). So far the second book seems much better, so am looking forward to the growth and development of the characters and the writer."
2,I can't believe I wasted my time,"I love a good murder mystery. This was far from it. It was a bumbling mess with a copout ending. Undeveloped characters, disjointed plotting, and the murders go unsolved. It had just enough for me to want to find out who did it and then left me without an answer."
1,the book without an ending,"A complicated story that you wait for the end to come together, and then it just ends without a conclusion. What a bad way to write, feels like the reader was cheated.I had to reborrow the book on line to finish, and wishes I hadn't bothered"
2,Indoctrination 101,"All in all this is not a bad little mystery. Good light reading. However, there is a ""subliminal"" message that continues throughout the book that anybody that appreciates the 2nd Amendment or religion is an idiot. I won't be reading more by this ""so so"" author."
2,Am I part of an experiment or something?,"I feel like I am being recorded on a camera while reading this book perhaps by a scientific study group of some kind looking for a reaction when I reach the lack of end. There really is no end. I often find that other reviewers can be highly over dramatic in their reviews. So, naturally I thought the people who said this book did not have an ending were just being snarky. Turns out they were right. This book shows potential in the beginning and has some interesting parts in the middle, but then it just dies. There is not even any prelude to the death. It is there and then it is gone. I am lost and for once can't figure out what else there could possibly be to say about this title."
3,It's Okay,"It's an okay book, kinda took me a while to get into it, but i enjoyed it. def. wouldn't pay for it."
4,Like A Bottle of Wiine,"Some memories are sweet, some bitter. This life has to be kept in my memory in order to salvage my sanity. While I can, I must return and weep."
2,You can't judge a book by its cover,"I picked up several of the books in this series when they were free. I felt somewhat lucky to have found professional-looking books amongst the freebies. ""Summer People"" is pretty bad. I could go on and on about what's wrong with this one. After my biggest (of many) ""what the...?"" moment at 58%, I came back here to see what other reviewers said. I saw that many said the book ended without the mysteries being solved. I was slightly intrigued with this concept, so I finished ""Summer People"" then searched the second book, ""Color Tour,"" for a couple of the characters' names hoping that there might be an ongoing investigation. No, not there. Instead, ""Color Tour"" starts with the widow of a ""Hugh"" who of course is not the same Hugh that was in ""Summer People."" (""Summer People"" is guilty of having at least three pairs of unrelated characters with the same first name.)"
2,Not satisfying,"This book read easily, but had major problems. It was a good idea for a story, but lacks essentials for making it a good read (for me anyway.)There is no character development, you just never really get to feel anything for any of the characters. I kept reading, trudging through the story line that continually jumped from one story to another and then thinly tries to tie them together, so that I could get to the end. You have to know ""who done it"" in a murder mystery right? Well don't keep reading, the nice neat ending will never come.I just wasn't satisfied, I was still scrolling looking for more pages!"
2,Not quite What i was expecting.,This book does not have the practical information i was expecting.It's a little boring and hard To read.I haven't used it for studying.
5,Best new flavor!,"Okay, usually I buy organic cake mixes, but this was a new and unusual flavor so on an impulse I bought a package at my local Farm Fresh grocery store. I baked it in a bundt pan and only dusted it w/ organic powdered sugar as a frosting. All of us thought it was incredibly delicious. It does not taste artificial (like the strawberry cake flavor does-another impulse buy that I will NOT repeat). I wish it did not contain partially hydrogenated oil, but nonetheless it is soooo tasty, that I will continue to buy it."
1,iPod Connectivity,"The Jabra A125s IPod bluetooth adapter is easy to set up and connect. The bluetooth connection is great unless you plan to keep the unit in your pocket. There are many glitches and cuts in the music in that case. Also, it does not seem to work very well with wind. I purchased this product for the freedom to exercise and ride my bicycle without wires. Unfortunately, the product does not work very well for that purpose. The breaks in the music is maddening. It works best resting on a surface next to the bluetooth speakers or headset."
1,Don't waste your money,"Two major problems with this item. First, it didn't pair well with my jabra bluetooth headset. Second, it did not stay inserted in the i-phone. If you intend to even walk while using this device I would not order it. If placed in a pocket the adapter falls out of the phone. I even tried carrying it in my hand and walking and the adapter was jarred loose within minutes. The product needs improvement"
5,great purchase,well priced - my area sells it for much more - i am very pleased - it is very hard to find gluten free items especially good ones. thanks
1,A Sinking Boatload of Idioms,I bought this item at first thinking it was a book..opps. When I received it I thought I'd at least see what it was all about and loaded it into my computer. The format is all .pdf with no illustrations and only 3 pages of actual exercises for all of the one thousand idioms. I have seen better lists and exercises for free on the internet. It was a total disappointment.
2,"Made of cheap plastic, cables visible everywhere","I bought this unit thinking I would buy one of those Toto seats that I had seen Japan. However, I am extremely disappointed. This washlet is made of very fragile, cheap plastic. The cable are extremely visible from the outside. I moved this unit to my guest bathroom since it was extremely ugly to stay in my master bedroom.The remote control is a nice feature, and installation itself is extremely simple."
5,I LOVE IT!,"PROS: SEAT HEATER, INSTANT HOT WATER HEATER, SELF CLEANING WAND, REMOTE CONTROLL,DRYER, WORKS GREAT.NEGATIVES: WIRES SHOW ON RIGHT SIDE, A LITTLE ""PLASTICALLY"", A LITTLE BULKIER THAN A REGULAR TOILET SEAT. NEED TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC OUTLET (GFCI) BEHIND THE TOILET.OTHERINTERNAL COMPONETS SEEM TO BE HIGH QUALITY.MADE IN JAPANOVERALL I LOVE IT."
5,Straight to Hell.,"I always liked the Clash when I was a boy, and then they broke up. Later, I bought this compilation of hits and non-hits. I think it's an excellent conglomeration of a great punk band. To be sure, disc two is somewhat tedious, but the two disc set works nicely. Now that it's been digitally remastered, the sound quality is even better. If you want individual Clash cds, then London Calling and Sandanista would be places to start. This collection is a must have for any rock collector."
5,Rock the Cashbox,"Cheaper than ""The Clash On Broadway,"" nice introduction to ""The Only Band that Matter(-ed)."" Some disparage the lack of chronology in track orderings, but it's really not a problem: just invert the order of the disks. Disk 2 which has the more punk sounding songs from the first three albums, while Disk 1 has the later ""hits"": ""Train In Vain,"" ""Rock the Casbah,"" et al. Actually, that shouldn't be taken too disparagingly: by the later records the Clash had significantly broadened their sonic palettes beyond the harder/faster punk aesthetic, and Disk 1 provides a nice overview, without, for example, actually having to sit through ""Sandinista!"".Usual anthology quibbles about song selection (where's ""Guns on the Roof""? or ""I'm So Bored with the U.S.A.""?), but the liner notes are amusing, especially the story about Roxy ""they came, they saw, they split"" Music.So where's volume 2?"
3,out o' date,The existence of this compilation is no longer justified.Get thee to _The Essential Clash_.Or better: _Clash on Broadway_. That and _London Calling_ might be all you ever need.This is not on the list.
5,Otoboku Maidens Are Falling for Me Vol 2: Drag Dilemmas,this is a great dvd to get if you do not have it yet. You should get itty for selling
1,this product is dangerous,"The rear end plug is held in the tube with two plastic latches. I my case latches were slightly rounded off and weak. When I received it, I lubricated and tested without the paint. The rear end popped out and as the piston is spring loaded against it the spring sent this piece flying into my finger joints that were pulling the handle. And no, I was not applying excessive force at the full extension. Latches start letting go even midway the travel. My finger joint that took the hit got purple for few hours and still hurts a bit to touch day later. I'm not a cry-baby type and would not complain on getting burned with the hot coffee. Would I be loading it that moment the popped out piston would send paint flying everywhere causing a terrible mess. I heated this latches with the lighter and bent out a little they would hold better now but I'm still uncertain and would probably just dump it. I haven't tried it yet in action and probably would not."
1,What a mess!,"I never write reviews, but this product is so bad I thought it was my Amazonly duty... no... my duty as an American to warm my fellow citizens. Red, Blue, Tea Party - Listen to me.It is not like I hate time-saving products. I love the Wagner power roller. But this... this t-h-i-n-g... is a paint squirting monster - hard to control, drips, shoots paint all over the place if you hold down the trigger a millisecond too long.Save yourself the cleanup headache and just buy a good paintbrush."
1,This device can cause expensive damage. Beware.,"I used this product after checking out an instructional video. The result was disastrous. The business end of the trim painter spreads paint everywhere; it glops on crudely from the middle of the pad and flows out the edges, undesirably covering the sides of adjacent trim. Meanwhile, paint pours out the tail end of the unit, covering the floor beneath with a lot of paint. I was lucky enough to be working above a quality painter's cloth. The way this unit malfunctions could spread paint exactly where it's not meant to be, causing difficult to repair or expensive damage. Overall, I strongly suggest you buy a good brush and not waste your time with this product."
3,Great tool BUT,"Thi is a great tool but Lowes does not carry Wagner, and HD doesn't cary much Wagner stuff in particular the replacement paint head for the ""trim it""...if there is such a thing. Otherwise the tool works great and would have been a 5 star rating."
3,Good but...,This product works as described. It is a pretty good tool. The major drawbacks are that the pad could be larger and it would be helpful if it came with a corner attachment. I found that a regular edger pad works a lot better and faster than this unit.
2,Didnt work out for us.,Thought this would make cutting in easier but found it to be a pain to use. Ended up using a brush instead.
2,Significant Design Issues,"Bought this from HD, thinking it would save me time. In the long run, the rework I had to perform negated any time savings I should have received.The system works by loading paint into the device and delivering the paint to the wall through the trim pad, pressurized by a spring loaded piston that pushes the paint through the pad. The amount of paint delivered is regulated by the trigger mechanism.Unfortunately, the spring is too strong for the device. When the trigger is pushed, even momentarily, too much paint is pushed out the pad, causing drips, run, and globs. Additionally, paint leaked out the back end of the device, making a larger mess.Not a bad idea as a time saver, but the design needs work. This product gets an A for Effort, but an F for Failure."
3,Works but not terribly useful,The item works as advertised and is easy to clean. It doesn't drip much at all. I just found that with most of my trim not being flat surfaces it wasn't terribly useful. I wound up using a brush and dealing with the drips.
4,Spot chases his ball around the circus,If your child likes Spot books I'm sure they'll enjoy this one.Spot loses his ball and chases it all over the circus trying to catch it ... finally ended up being taught to balance it on his nose by a seal. A fun adventure your toddler will love!
4,Great book!!,"My 15 month old daughter LOVES the ""Spot"" books (with the flaps). The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it's not available (at least when I ordered it) in the thick, board book! So, the book is flimsy and tears easily (we usually hold the book and turn the pages, so as to limit ""tearing"" opportunities). As she gets older, she knows not to tear the book anymore, so that will help the books last. We've had to reorder a few times but it's worth it...she gets so excited for these books every time we pick one up to read! And the best part is how she excitedly looks for the flap and gets such a sense of satisfation when she lifts the flap! I also like how it encourages kids to ""think outside the box"" since this book comes alive! We'll order and re-order these books until she doesn't like them anymore! I would recommend them to any parent!!!"
4,A Victory for Aboriginal Peoples,"This book tells the story of how a small Indian Band in Vancouver, Canada sued to recover compensation for the lease of one third of its small reserve to an exclusive golf club on terms to which it did not agree. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada and resulted in major changes in the law that benefitted all Aboriginal peoples in Canada. The book describes those changes and compares the law in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The author was one of the lawyers for the Band and describes what was involved to achieve justice for the Band."
1,Did not work for me,I just recently became lactose intolerant and have just started trying out different products related to lactose intolerance. So far this is the only lactase product I have tried but after trying it several times with different food items it did not make ANY difference in how my body now reacts to lactose. I was very disappointed.
3,Product works,However. However about 20 or so of these packets had no pill in them. Overall the cost is small but that's not cool.
3,If I have to 'toot' one more time I am going to die!,"I'll make this short and sweet.This pill does prevent me from getting diarrhea after drinking milk or having cereal but the amount of gas I produce is still out of control. I'll put it this way. I ate two bowl of cereal before going to bed last night and ALL night I tooted soooo much and sooo hard that I woke up every time. Funny I know but you could imagine how your partner would feel about that sleeping next to you.I think I may shift back to the Lactade milk I was previously drinking...no problem there, just don't like the fact they use rbst with their milk. :/"
4,Not OU Kosher anymore,"Although the picture of the box has an OU, the Kirkland Signature Fast Acting Lactase is not certified kosher anymore, and the new boxes don't have an OU."
1,doesn't work,"I thought these would have the same ingredients and efficacy as Lact-Aid, but these don't seem to work. I will be going back to Lact-Aid pills instead."
3,Can not really review this item.,"I thought I had lactose intolerance but after I ordered this product, I found out with a test from Doctor's office that that is not my problem with milk. So, I can not really review this product truthfully. But I do know that Amazon was able to come up with the best price for it."
3,Works well but crumbles if left unwrapped,"I use lactaid pills everyday, many times a day. For many years I loved Kirkland Signature's (Costco Brand) lactaid pills because they saved me a lot of money. I buy big boxes and then take them out of their wrappers and put them into a pill box that I keep in my purse. Once Kirkland switched from Ultra to Fast Acting, I was no longer able to do this. While these pills do work just as well lactaid at negating lactose intolerance, they crumble in my pill box which renders them unusable. So now I have had to switch back to brand name lactaid which I can buy at a discount at BJ's instead of Costco."
4,Really good,"Good product, I always take a least two for each glass of milk and it works fine. Take more if you keep drinking/eating.Delivery was fast."
4,"Good, but use caution.",I've taken different brands of lactose pills without problems. This one caused some upset (seems to push the lactose out rather than digest it) until I discovered that it only takes half a pill. Now I'm fine.
1,low qualities,"The quality is declined quickly by heat exposure. Not that effective, just cheap price. I highly recommend Lactaid Chewable over this product."
1,Can't figure out why it's not working,"Over the past 10 years, I've been using the Lactaid, Target and CVC brands of lactase, which all seemed to get the job done. For some reason, even though the active ingredient is exactly the same, I do not get any relief from dairy-related symptoms with this product. I've taken about 20 of these capsules by now at various meals, but I haven't noticed any positive effect."
1,Doesn't work very well,"The Kirkland Fast Acting Lactase sold by Costco does not work well at all. I've been using the CVS brand (same dosage) for years and have never had any problems with digesting dairy until I bought this product and started to use it. I have reread the exact directions on how to use this to make sure I was following their requirements and it was still useless. BTW, this product is about $14.99 at Costco."
1,Kirkland Fast Act Lactase,"I have experiment lactaid before Kirkland fast acting and the 2 works fine for me, the difference is the price: kirkland is at least 50% cheaper than lactaid."
3,Heart of many...............................................,This is a Chicagoan. My favorite Cuz Frankie works at the Post Office with Evadne's brother. Knowing that I love to read she was supportive to us both!EXPRESSING IS LIVING! Soulfull is a motivational guide geared towards your daily survivial!Sometimes in life you cry out for help. Seeking some sort of comfort. When it's your soul and it appears to be on the blink Soulfull can inspire and motivate you.
2,I was duped into buying this one.....it's just not that good,"The sound and picture quality of this dvd is poor, which really disappointed me. I was on a waiting list to purchase this one, and I can honestly say that it was NOT worth the wait....or the price I paid for it."
1,Don't do it- don't watch this film!!!,"This is a miserably boring film. As a devotee of the bad scary movie genre, I cannot even recommend this for its humorous or gross content. It is merely laborious to sit through. all the reviews you read were correct. Cindy Sherman's amazing photography has not translated well to the motion picture screen. Ringwald and Tripplehorn turns in high school play calibre performances, and it is painful to watch the great talent of Ms. Kane so devalued in this piece of schlock. Rent more fascinating, subtle, scary and truly hilarious species of this type of film-ones that succeed where Sherman's attempt fails (e.g. Rod Steiger in ""No Way To Treat A Lady"" comes to mind-if you are insistent upon slashing in an office setting, good god even rent ""The Temp""-but don't rent this and certainly do not buy it)."
3,I BEG TO DIFFER...,"Whew, this one got trashed here, didn't it? Well, I enjoyed it, actually. It's an arty little B-movie... A curiosity which is shaken to life by Carol Kane's near-flawless performance. Wow! A role she sinks her teeth (and knives) into. I'd love to give specific examples but they're so well-timed I'd be spoiling it. The viewer is led to be sympathetic, then not, then sympathetic again in a very refreshing way. My personal quibbles are a few character inconsistencies, some arty shots that, while beautiful, are distracting, and the disappointingly Hollywood ending... Otherwise, this gruesome, bleak little exercise is fun, sick fun, but FUN... Hey, Cindy Sherman loves THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and this is in a similar vein... When other arty directors are bludgeoning the viewer with self-indulgence and lame messages, this film provides a welcome alternative."
1,Bunk,"I bought one of these, thinking it would work great, so I plugged it in to my desktop, following their instructions, opened up something to watch the new serial port it created (that part worked), then I watched it do nothing, nothing at all.no data received or anything. I went looking for the manufacturer to get some assistance, and none exists. I suggest avoiding this thing."
5,Harmonious and Tranquil,"This is a wonderful CD to meditate with, or simply relax into the flow of spirituality.."
4,SPELL BINDING!,"Being a BIG fan of JAWS, I felt I had to have the new soundtrack. I was very much pleased with the addition of the other cues. And its also nice to have them in the order they appear in the film. The soundtrack is a MUST for any fan of JAWS!"
2,"The first few chapters are not helpful, giving no examples on how to work problems.","This text assumes much more than it should. Although I understand Diff EQ, and some Linear Algebra, the text was basically very vague. I prefer exhaustive explanations, as opposed to ""a smoke and mirrors"" approach. Unfortunately this book fits within the usual collection of over-generalized and poorly explained material that has sadly become the norm in technical education. Why give us exercises covering theorems that the book may not have even addressed. At a minimum, anything that is educational should be helpful."
4,Nice basic slave flash.,"Very basic and easy to use slave flash. I think it is very good for amature photographers just starting to work with a slave flash. You will see a very dramatic difference in very low light and outdoor evening shots. Although it will hook up to a tripod, it isn't very secure, moving and throwing the camera off balance, thus eliminating the point of using a tripod."
4,Handy Little Optical Slave Flash,"This is a really handy little slave flash. It has just one power setting (Full Power) so I use it for ceiling bounce only. With NiMH rechargeable batteries, the cycle time is only 1~2 seconds.Adjusting the camera on-board flash down (-1 EV to -2 EV to provide softer front lighting and aiming the slave (on a tripod next to me) at the ceiling to provide a bright top lighting, I liked what I got so far.All the on-board flashes I tested (I tried 5 different cameras, with and without pre-flashes) triggered this slave without a misfire, once it woke up. Please read on.Only problem I encountered was that when first started it would not sync/flash until I pointed the camera's on-board flash directly at the slave and ""woke"" it up with a few flashes. Once it responded with a bright flash, all sessions afterward would sync properly. If I turned off the slave and restarted it, I had to ""wake"" it up again. Slight inconvenience, but at this price point I have no complaints."
1,Works with my Point and Shoot Canon for 1 day. Died next day.,"All the Point and Shoot cameras are very convenience to carry; however, the biggest drawback is the flash not strong enough. Taken group picture indoor is always a big challenge because pictures came out mostly dark. I bought a slave adapter for my Sunpak to find out the flash output is too strong for my camera - all objects are washed out. This little Sakar 318 flash is just strong enough to extend my range for my internal flash to capture the group picture. Love it!Update: Oops, the flash only worked for 1 day. Next day - it stopped! The flash only fires when press the test button. So disappointed!!!"
3,Cheap bandana,"It's not made out of the greatest material in the world, but for a buck what else do you expect."
1,Awful product,"These are the cheapest of the cheap bandanas. I handwashed them with cold water and no soap and they ran immediatly to the point of which I had to throw them away. the red and blue ""runs"" so bad they cant get wet. Good for hanging up somewhere I suppose but youd be better off getting a flag."
1,Terrible product ignore the reviews!,"I bought this product. because, I am an American and wanted to show the pride. however, I washed it once and the red bled into the white and looked pink. on top of that it says ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't want some chinese kid making an American bandana for a nickel an hour putting led in the thing. this was a disgrace to my country and flag bandana so, I did what every American does when they have a defective flag. I burned it. :( I will never buy again! waste of money I should of went to the store and bought a box of honey buns!"
2,"Cheap, Thin, Flimsy","This bandana is too small to comfortable tie around your head if you wear a size 8 hat. It's so thin you can just about read through it. The colors look cheap and like they'd run/bleed if it gets wet. The material looks weak and like it wouldn't hold up to much use, let alone the wash. I don't recommend it and wouldn't buy it again. I do wish I could find something, even for a higher price, better made, color fast, from quality material, made in the USA (not China), and large enough to comfortably tie around a big head. Yeah...I know--don't say it!"
1,Terrible paint,On the first wash with cold water all colors mixed and destroyed the other 2 items in the washer.Terrible paint.
3,Nothing says patriotism like soaking the flag with my rancid sweat...,"When I go the local tractor pull it gets hot. I'm not talking about damp underarm and moist underbelly ""Left Coast"" dry heat, I'm talking bone bleaching, soul baking, dig yourself a hole in the ground and crawl in Texarkana hot. I'm talking wring out buckets of brown sweat from your crusty T-Shirt hot.If I don't wear a bandana on my head that salty river of pain runs into my eyes and I can't tell Gravedigger from Bigfoot. It's nice to be able to show my patriotism at the same time. Being a heavier kinda guy, it's also helpful to use this bandana to wipe the sweat from between the hirsute folds of fat on my generous frame, particularly around the ribs.The best way to show your respect to Old Glory is to display it every possible place you can imagine...USA...USA...USA...USA...USA..."
2,"Unreliable, Sparsely Located Information","This, a very frustrating book, links factual information with ""myth"". His apparent knowledge of the competative system is quite limited. No sources are given, and there is very little information that is specific enough to check. Perhaps a good source for a child's report."
1,dance story,I ordered this book expecting to see a list of dances with instructions. That's what I wanted...the instructions. Instead I got a story book with nice little watercolor paintings in it. I was vastly disappointed.
2,"cute, but expensive for plastic...","I thought this product was made of wood, as so many Brio products are. It is made of plastic - everything except the small lion which is wood. This doesn't seem very good value for the money considering the materials."
3,"Fun, but made of plastic","Our newly 2 yr old guy has been captivated by the Brio train sets since he was 18 months old. The First Railway Set is a delight, as is the Safari Set, with their (mostly) wooden components.I ordered this separate train set so that he'd have more cars and animals. It's cute, the little giraffe neck moves up and down, and he loves it. Unfortunately, it's plastic. Although it's certainly of fairly heavy plastic, it's not nearly as durable as the wood and I can't see handing this set down to future generations of kids.I was really disappointed in the lower quality. ."
3,Disappointing quality for BRIO,"I grew up with BRIO and am very happy that my 2 year old son now loves his train set. My son received many BRIO pieces for his birthday, including the Safari Figure 8 set, so I thought this would be a fun addition even though I had to hunt this item down, as it appears to be discontinued. However, when this set arrived, I was very disappointed with BRIO's use of plastic rather than the traditional wood. All of the train cars are made of plastic, the giraffe is plastic, the elephant might be wood but isn't obvious as it is fully painted over, and the lion is wood with some details painted on. The three animals are so radically different that if I didn't know better, I wouldn't believe them to all be part of the same set. My son doesn't know the difference of course, but I can't see this being something special to save for his kids. I guess I should have read the Amazon reviews first!"
1,Big disappointment for Tango fans,"I purchased this CD with great expectations which were completely dashed. I have always wished that Placido Domingo would record a CD of Argentine tango, since he has the voice and sense of drama to do justice to the art of tango. So when I saw this CD, I thought, ""Wow!""However, this CD is a crime commited against tango. The arrangements are not traditional Argentine tango, but the most saccharine gringo tango. I wish that Domingo had recorded with a real tango orchestra like Color Tango or the orchestra from Forever Tango.Furthermore, this CD recycles music from the soundtrack to the Carlos Saura movie Tango. You might as well get that CD instead of this one for the few tracks worth listening to."
5,wonderful!,The performance of various musicians is recorded and is a pleasant CD. I recommend all of you with confidence. Thank you very much.
4,"I read the book a long time ago, but I remember it being good.","I have to preface this review by stating that I know (or knew) Dr. Lewbart several years ago when I was an undergrad at NCSU. He was our pre-vet club adviser at the time. He was always willing to give his time to his students, so would recommend the book just based on his character alone. I love Clive Cussler's adventure novels, and while Dr. Lewbart's writing is not of the same caliber, the story weaves some of the same paths as a Cussler novel, albeit with quite a different subject matter. I will always treasure the book as it was a gift from Dr. Lewbart, but I think you will enjoy it also for it's prose and story."
3,Reversible -- kind of,"This cover is cute, and seems to be decently made. However, it's not reversible in the way you might think; I assumed that ""two-sided"" meant you could turn the pillow case inside out to reveal the complementary pattern, but what it really means is that you can flip the Boppy over to see the other pattern -- it's flowers on the top and stripes on the bottom. (The side with the stripes has the zipper across the broad part of the pillow, so you probably wouldn't use it with this side up.) Just thought that was worth pointing out...."
5,Cute!,I bought this for my girlfriend who had a little girl three weeks after I had my son and was so jealous that the girly boppy covers are so much cuter than the options for the boyish ones!
1,Not very soft,If you are looking for a soft material this one is not for you. I know some reviewers state it feels softer after washing it but if I still didn't like it then I would not have been able to return it.
4,Very handy in India,"The book is very handy to carry around. The translations are colloquial and useful as opposed to Indian books that give every definition no matter how obsure. There is a problem with using boldface to indicate nasals, but the boldface is very hard to notice. Also noun gender isn't indicated. It is the book I carry in my pocket in India."
4,Brief but thorough,"This book is very handy for those who want to learn the basic structure of and handy phrases in Hindi or Urdu. Good for travelers, both in content and in size--it is small and easy to carry around. As an Indian and native Hindi speaker, I found this to be a good introduction to the language for those seeking only that much."
2,They changed the formula!,"I've been using Mychelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream for about 8 months now and I've really liked it. But the reason I purchased it was because it contained Matrixyl 3000 and I'd heard excellent things about the anti-aging benefits of this ingredient. But upon recently receiving a new jar, I was very disappointed to discover that Mychelle has changed the formula and Matrixyl 3000 is no longer part of this cream. It is still listed as an ingredient on Amazon and the old package is still displayed.I now feel misled and will no longer be purchasing this product. The search for the perfect moisturizer continues."
3,Matrixyl 3000-- gone missing,"According to the people at Mychelle, the matrixyl no longer met ""strict guildelines of cleanliness"" and has been replaced by three peptides that are supposed to be even more effective: marine oligopeptides; pisum sativum (pea peptide); and rice peptides. Hmm this seems a rather questionable ""upgrade."" Read our review here:http://www.truthinaging.com/2008/07/mychelle-supreme-upgrades-from-matrixyl-3000.html"
1,Hurt my sensitive skin,"I was sad, but I had to return this product. It hurt my sensitive skin. I have been able to use a few ""commercial"" products, I try to keep them all natural. I was excited about this one after trying a sample. But after a few applications, each one ending in red cheeks- it felt like a chemical burn- I returned the product. Sorry it didn't work out. It seems like a good company. Maybe it was just my sensitive skin."
3,"Love the cream, but not the ""unscented""","I love this cream, but the ""unscented"" isn't great. One night I was wearing it to bed, and my husband asked me what was that smell. Turns out it was my ""unscented"" cream. I've bought the scented, and it's actually fairly pleasant. Like I said, love the cream, just not the scent."
2,Polypeptide cream,This cream is much different from the one I bought MyChelle directly. Quality and feel is not the same as the one I bought from MyChelle.
1,Beware! Obviously opened and used product!,"When this finally arrived I opened it to find the interior cap missing, cream smeared inside the outer cap, and 25% plus of the cream scooped out from one side - it was immediately obvious. Cream level was normal elsewhere in the jar, so it hadn't slide over to one side. I had another 1.2 oz Mychelle night cream jar, used daily since 3/7 (I mark these to see how long they'll last me), so I weighed both. The old jar weighs 2 oz exactly today. The new jar? Just under 2 oz. What's worse, I missed the MyChelle March sale because of buying the cream here. AND the vendor is Amazon itself. They'll refund my $, but this is not legal."
5,"i have heard it but NOT bought it, but i should","ok, i love this sone and it must be the best song of hers, and after she left eastenders(brit soap) it has not been the same. and i admire her because she is the typical woman who is strong. and she sings very well"
4,great explanations.,I had to buy this book in college and was so happy I did. It's taught me dreamweaver better than my actual teacher did
3,Teach Yourself Visually Dreamweaver 8,"I think this book is missing a chapter at the beginning. It starts out nice and step by step and then jumps right into editing and reviewing a web site that they never explained how to make. Between pages 25 and 26 there should be a chapter about developing something to ""preview"". They shouldn't have ""The fast and easy way to learn"" if this book is for Dreamweaver users who just need direction on individual issues."
3,misrepresented,"This is not the product I received. Instead I got some generic version, but they seem to work fine so far."
2,Not what I ordered,"Was pleased to find Bissell bags on Amazon because I could not find them anywwhere in stores in the size I needed. HOWEVER, when the bags arrrived, they were not Bissell bags- just generic vacuum bags in a clear plastic bag. If I wanted generic, I would have bought them at a store and saved shipping costs."
5,Great Product,"Product fit perfectly, works as it should. Delivery could've been faster but besides that, there's nothing about the product to complain about."
5,Bissell vacuum bags,My order was just what I was looking for. They were in excellent condition upon arrival. When I need more I will place an order with you.
4,"Lewton, Wise, and Karloff at their best.","Based on a story by Robert Louis Stevenson, this venerable classic barely qualifies as a horror film, but is excellent in all departments. Surprisingly, it took a long time to be released and received mostly mediocre reviews when finally released! However, it is probably the best film produced by Val Lewton, and Robert Wise proves he was already a fine director at almost the beginning of his career. The atmosphere of early 19th century Edinburgh is fully convincing. Boris Karloff is superb as Gray, cabman by day and body snatcher (occasionally corpse- maker) by night. He rarely had a role better suited to him. Watch for a young Robert Clarke as a medical student."
3,Probably the best of the Lewton thrillers,"This, along with I Walked with a Zombie, is the best of the Lewton thrillers. A highly literate horror film it contains what is probably Karloff's finest performance. His performance is matched by that of Henry Daniell who plays a basically decent physician, tormented by Karloff's evil grave robber. Bela Lugosi has a minor supporting role as a none-too-bright would-be blackmailer who is ""disposed"" of by Karloff. This is a B horror film with grade A acting (by Karloff and Daniell), a grade A script and grade A attention to detail (set design, photography, etc.) Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars."
5,Insightful and fun,Julie Jansen gives solid advice on how to get a work life you like. I love her self-assessment exercises - they can help everyone.
3,Just okay,This book is well written but the information is nothing new. You could probably just sit down with a friend (or your mom) and talk about someone at work who is hard to get along with and they would give you the same advice.
4,Definitely helped,"After experiencing a fall, I had bruised bones, torn ligaments and broken blood vessels, my doctor recommended this product to help stabilize my ankles for a few months. It definitely helped, but it would have been better if the instructions were a little more specific on how to fit ; e.g., ""adjust straps"" didn't explain why you would need to adjust the straps. A side view picture of how the brace should fit when wearing a shoe would have helped. With the design, I could not wear anything but a sport shoe, and that was tricky. Overall, if you have an ankle injury, this should help a lot."
1,Fringes on the Dress,I ordered this costume for Purium and all the fringes on the bottom have come off. My daughter really wants to wear it still. May I get another shipped at no cost?
3,Awestriking!,It is truly amazing that Mr. Hull has been able to guilt this many friends and family into writing reviews for him. Brava!
1,Dont Buy,I purchased several products from this manufacturer. Their products are not what they adverstise them to be. The scents do not last long. Some of the products are dried up when you receive them. This is one purchase I fully regret. Do not waste your money.
1,Works great for 7 months,"When I bought this scanner for our school library, I was really impressed. It worked right away; real plug and play. It scanned any bar code I tried and worked flawlessly. Until one day 7 months later. While scanning a barcode from one book worked fine, the next did not. And that was it. The device died just like that."
3,Expensive but fun book by the always enjoyable Rick Telander,"I have always enjoyed Telander's writing, and miss him when I read Sports Illustrated. He is one of the most decent men writing about sports, and has written some important books about college football, especially ""The Hundred Yard Lie."" Also, the book about Wisconsin getting to the Rose Bowl was excellent.This book, published by Sports Publishing, was a fun, quick read. I just wish it was cheaper than the listed price. Guess that's what happens when you buy from a specialty publishing house.Of course, Telander's greatest book, and a book that should be read by every serious sports fan, is ""Heaven is a Playground."" A must buy.Enjoy."
4,A Handy Little Book on the Blood Covenant,"Although this book doesn't get into the depth that a book such as H.C. Trumbull's ""The Blood Covenant"" does, it is quite adequate to handle the needs of the average reader as opppopsed to the scholar doing research. This is typical Kenyon and any one who has read after him realizes the nuggets of wisdom and knowledge so prevalent in his books. Those nuggets are also in this book. Highly recommended to those who are just learning about the Blood Covenant in Jesus we enter into at our salvation."
5,Excellent book!,"The Blood Covenant by E.W. Kenyon is an inspirational read! It is almost devotonal in style but is very powerful. The authors easily understood writing makes the theme of the Blood Covenant and especially the Blood Covenant in Communion come alive. It is a short book, but one you will want to read many times."
2,Not done justice,"This was my first ""Mikado"" heard at age 12 in 1959. In many ways this is my favourite. Why? Well the best ever KoKo in Martyn Green, and the best ever Mikado in Darryll Fancourt. Add to that the pretty well faultless YumYum of Margaret Mitchell and the even handsome-on-record Leonard Osborn. The conducting by Isidore Godfrey is definitive. But this transfer by Naxos is appalling. They make it sound like it was recorded in the 20's. I played the CD's side by side with the vinyl and it's hard to believe they are the same recording. There is a much better tranfser available from Sounds on CD in the UK. Why doesn't Amazon have that one on offer also?"
2,"Poor Fidelity, recorded in 1950","Although admirably serving the noble purpose of preserving for posterity the vocal performances of some incredibly famous G&S 'specialists'(eg, Darrell Fancourt), this CD [set] is not for the average G&S fan, among whose ranks I count myself. Unfortunately, the preservation of old recordings is a tough thing, and this version suffers from terrible fidelity overall and in many songs, completely unintelligible lyrics. Many fans know all the lyrics by heart, but hearing them distorted and fuzzy grossly distracts from the experience and certainly won't win over any new fans. I thought I was taking the reasonable and less expensive route with this version, but will have to buy the more recent recording to enjoy Mikado. Do yourself a favor, save up a little longer, and buy the more expensive (recent) recording."
2,Great performance - terrible mastering,"I don't know what Naxos is thinking (or hearing) but yhey are doing a really awful job on their remasterings of the early 50s Gilbert and Sullivan recordings. Thin sounding and cramped - little surface noise but a whole layer of life is gone from the recordings. A comparison with the incomparably better Sounds on CD mastering is telling - the Naxos is cheaper and they sound it - in this case, you get what you pay for."
3,SWEET BEYOND BELIEF,"Okay, so this cute girl who talks to her stuffed animal may not SEEM like an engrossing read, but JUST A GIRL really did hook me in.The art is wonderful and the humor is well placed and the story just simply flows. The lead character, Erica, has just moved to a high school all by herself, but she only feels confident when she has her stuffed animals with her. When she befriends a girl named Rena her confidence finally grows beyond the plushies and she really becomes herself. Rena, however, has a dark past and she is also moving forward, but will Erica continue to support her?This heartwarming story is recommended for those starting a new life at school, a new job, or even a new home. Or for those who like talking to their stuffed animals."
3,Unsatisfactory,This book is alright but for the serious errors in listings of code(Typographical I suppose!). For a beginner this problem may confuse.Concepts must be fully explained before listings containing these schema objects are displayed.
3,Overall most of the songs are great,I love the song selections on this CD but I had problems with a few tracks skipping. I did not take the time to return it since most of plays sufficiently.
4,Pure,"A co-worker brought me a cassette version of this gorgeous LP after she returned to India for her sisters wedding. All I knew of Indian music at that point was the brilliance of Ravi Shankar and the tinny sound of movie soundtracks.Don't get me wrong, I love Shankar. This is another avenue, and in some ways a more peaceful one, into Indian classic music. Shankar seems (to my poorly trained American ear) more structured, more cosmopolitan; Call of The Valley has a more agrarian feel to it.On a side note, I find it endlessly amusing that the closing track on the cassette, Rag Pahadi, is based on a three-tone motif identical to the cheesy 1950s-American single ""Baby Face."""
5,The best Indian music recording I've heard!,"I'm married to an Indian and travelled in india numerous times and this is the best, and most accessible to western ears, piece of classical Indian music I've heard.Do yourself a favour and listen to it."
3,little value to me,"This compilations of sermons only covers the first 3 chapters of Revelation. It is ok but I don't find much value in it for the kind of research I do. Geoffery is very long winded and when he seems to get to the point he just does not deliver to my expectations. His long-windedness resembles that of St. John Chrysostom in his homilies, but without the worth-while insights that you receive from Chrysostom."
4,Cool and Stylish,"This is a pretty good movie. The story is not that memorable but the characters are what makes this film. I remember the first time I saw this film. It was by accident. I couldn't stop watching it. It's harmless fun.Lucy Diamond, master thief, meets and falls for Amy while trying to commit a crime. The rest of the movie features the two girls getting to know each other and a few funny spy spoof moments.The DVD features two commentary tracks: Director's Track, Cast's Track. Also included are deleted scenes, and a few featurettes about the making of the film.Recommended."
4,cute lesbian flick,this movie should be watched knowing that it's very in your face low production overdramatization movie--but it's very cute. and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,A great Lesbian film for the whole family!,"Because there are so few Lesbian films, I tend to see them all - even if they are terrible. So many are low budget films with horrible dialogue and starring people who can't act. D.E.B.S. is none of these. It is a hilarious film that should appeal to both gay and non-gay audiences.The premise of the story involves a secret agency (The DEBS) that is trying to apprehend the infamous criminal ""Lucy Diamond."" The DEBS are made up of young women who fight crime wearing school-girl uniforms and carrying large weapons.I don't know why this film was not in theaters for longer. It is the first Lesbian DVD I am actually buying so I can watch it over and over!"
3,Not bad,"The movie wasn't too bad as long as you're not looking for a serious drama or something that will hit close to home, but it's pretty funny and worth the time. For the most part I enjoyed this film."
4,D.E.B.S.,"A fun movie with nice scenery. Not good for kids to see, just adults. But for a change it was fun to watch."
2,Just so wrong,"This movie is trying to be a spy spoof, but it's really just one joke. It's not funny. I knew it was gonna be a bad movie, but THIS bad?"
2,G-A-Y But still pretty good.,"When I saw D.E.B.S I was verrrrrrrrrrrrrry disappointed. I don't think many people want 2 c 2 girls kissing and having sex. It should be rated R or 14 up. Though the comedy part was pretty good. But most of the comedy parts had swearing in them. If you've seen MEAN GIRLS ( Which was like sooooooooooo much better)you'll knowwhat words they are. Like Whore,and well I hope u get the point! C MEAN GIRLS instead of this!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,D.E.B.S.,this movie was tight. it was a verrrrrrrrrrrry interesting movie because you would not think that there would see two girls kissing. if you are looking for a movie to watch with alot of your friends this is the best movie to get together to watch watch. it is funny and has a lot of action.
3,movie_123456789,LOL.. acting is not bad-the script is badone of the DEBS is hott. / worth 5.99 mayB.
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I was flipping through the channels when I saw this movie's description saying ""The lead of a teen, all-girl crimefighting team falls for the villaness she supposed to apprehand."" I thought at first that maybe this was a typo, maybe it was supposed to say villan, not villaness. So I stopped and decided to watch it.To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Granted this movie was kinda lame, the acting cheesy. But how often do you see a comedy/spy flick with lesbian leads?! Jordana Brewster has totally stolen my heart as the tough, yet sweet villaness Lucy Diamond.It's not the greatest movie ever made, and there are somethings lacking, somethings that could be improved. But this movie does what it's meant to do: entertain!"
5,Not available in stores...,"This size fits perfectly into my sink. The Rubbermaid dishpans at the stores have a type of handle that makes it too wide. It's a Rubbermaid, so I don't have to tell you that it's of excellent quality. Kind of pricey but it will last a long time."
5,Dish pan,"I purchased this dish pan to wash hand washable items in. I looked at cheaper items and over the years, I have found that Rubbermaid makes the best products! This fits my needs."
5,Rubbermaid plastic dish pan,"Sturdy. It wasn't as large as I thought it would be, and couldn't use it for the reason I ordered it. No reason to return it so I put it to a different use."
5,out of print not out of luck,Thanks for providing such a great book that was in excellent shape for beingout of print in such a timely manner!
3,Pasta Fagioli's ok,There is nothing like fresh. This tastes like dried food and lacks some taste. My family ate it so I guess it's ok.
4,You only get what you always expect...,"Once again, from the multi-talented musician Billy Childish, here cames our favorite majorettes of grage sound. From this release, there are three members in the band. But their solid and fun garage tunes are better than ever! Yes, as always, you get '60's guitar sound which will rock your world! (Well, I thought I never gonna use this expression...) If you are a fun of '60's garage rock and a bit tired of digging up dusty old records, try this album! It successfully constructs (not ""re""construct) not only the sound but also feeling of garage rock!"
4,Great Book For Beginners,This is a very nice book and shows you many projects that you can tackle and finish even if you are a beginner.It is with nice and clear instructions and is certainly a book to have.
5,"If you're a new quilter, this book is for you!","I wanted to do some quilting and got this book out of the library. After renewing it twice, I decided to buy it, since I liked it so much.I have never quilted before, but this book is full of projects that an absolute beginner can pick up in a short time. The book starts out by explaining the basics of the sewing machine, fabric selection, how much fabric to buy, detailed explanations with many shortcuts to make your project easier. It's fun, easy, and good reading. Really recommend this book for new and also more experienced quilters."
1,Mostly common sense. Constantly plugging his other books,"I was disappointed that this book did not really give any new information. Most of what was written was common sense. Anyone who has ever had sales training already knows most of the techniques that dealers use. The author offers no checklist of items to inspect on the actual RV. He simply assumes that you already have all this information. Also, he spends a lot of time plugging his other book and organizatiom. The book itself is thin with many blank pages and big pictures. I think it is a bad buy."
5,Very good,"This is a great reference work for anyone with a professional or academic interest in the science, technology, economics and business of energy. The dictionary is the work of six professors/researchers at universities in the UK and one of their colleagues in industry. The definitions have descriptive and explanatory depth; some are accompanied by helpful drawings and formulas. The quality of the writing is first-rate. This edition of the dictionary was published in 1988; therefore, some of its definitions are out-of-date, as one would expect. Nevertheless, they don't detract from the overall value of the dictionary, whose perspective, generally speaking, feels contemporary."
3,not so bad...,"For a group like Crush, this song is ain't so bad. That might be an unfair statement to make considering that the only other single I have heard of their's was the horrendous ""Jellyhead"", but this one is way above euro-drivel like that. This single contains established remixers such as Lenny Bertoldo (Ace Of Base, Gina G, Zhane), Cibola (Amber, Jocelyn Enriquez, Brian McKnight) and Kano (740 Boyz & Shania Twain). The remixes are all decent, but I especially enjoy ""Kano's Spacefunk Mix"" because it has some Jetson's space car samples.."
5,Vise Grip Sheet metal tool,"Great product from Vise Grip, works great. Used it to alter A/C plenum and it worked great."
2,Irwin 23EL5 Vise Grip 8-Inch Locking Sheet Metal Tool,Just OK. I needed to flatten metal on a roof. It doesn't really do the job. I end up making my own tool.
2,Sound not clear,I bought this item to record speakers at a convention. The playback is not as clear as I had hoped. I am disappointed in the product.
1,Item not as pictured!!!,"The item ICDB300 I received was not as pictured. I received something entirely different than the ICDB300 that was pictured. Not sure if it was an earlier model or what. The item pictured showed it had a stereo mode and the model I received was a cheaper model that I could have bought at Walmart for $4.00 more. I was disappointed but I needed it for work so i kept it. I felt i got screwed and that amazon put up a picture of a different higher priced model. When i placed the order it showed it was in stock, after i paid for it i recieved and email saying it would be shipped approximately 2 months after the order was placed. It did arrive in 2 weeks though. Not sure what to think of amazon. The item and shipping was way off of wack. Not sure i can trust ordering from amazon again.........not sure what i will get or when it will arrive."
3,"not terrible, but wouldn't buy again","I really only use this for recording lectures when it's difficult to keep up with taking notes in class. In order to hear the professor, I need to set it to HQ, which means that it only holds about 7 hours (not very many classes). Right now my recorder is full, and it only has 4 lectures and an interview on it. It picks up a ton of background noise, too, which makes listening to it pretty annoying. This is my first recorder, however, so I don't have much to compare it to.I don't find the recorder difficult to use, but my uses are pretty basic. One of the reviewers said that the recorder pictured is not the ICD-B300, but they must have updated the picture because it's the one that I have."
1,bad luck,"I never thought I would get a defective product from Amazon. But I did this time ! (and it already past the 30 day return period ) What a bad luck .When playing back after done recording, the unit would skip the sound every so often to a point that I want to throw it into the trash can ."
5,Keep 'em coming back for more ...,"I've been following the Gourds ... well, since before they were the Gourds. Each release has showcased Kevin Russell and Jimmy Smith's eclectic songwriting talents. This latest release is no different. With the addition of Max Johnston as a more integral part of the band (he only appeared on some of the tracks on their last CD), the band has evolved into fine form. The Gourds strength lies in their devotion to good music. Here's to hoping that they'll keep on rolling ..."
4,basic,"I bought this course and have been working through it in the last month. I like this course, I remember things alot quicker when I can read along with a text book, without too much english.I have pimsleur basic and find it difficult because I can't see the words. I have to remember strings of syllables that make up words, made harder by sounds that aren't in english. Berlitz have made an easy approach to learning basic german. I have worked through ""Japanese for busy people 1"" and ""basic italian""."
3,"Nice, but not their best","Even the greats sometimes have ""just ok"" releases, and I think this is one of them. The music is (as always) well performed, but it's not breathtaking (as ""Beautiful Wasteland"" was). Enjoyable and worth owning."
2,A poor outing,"I have always been partial to Capercaillie's non-English tunes, particularly the ballads, but I have enjoyed the more Afro-Celt tunes on cd's like ""Beautiful Wasteland."" If you feel similarly, then a few of the ballads here are nice, but the upbeat songs are ""pop"" in the worst sense of a shallow, thin energy. I'd reserve this cd only for die-hard fans."
5,Capercaillie are brilliant,"I love this CD. Beautiful music. Innovative and modern Celtic sounds, wonderful voices. A great companion to From Dusk Till Dawn."
5,Very cute I can't wait to use it for a potluck,I received this as a wedding present off my amazon registry and it is just too cute. I can't wait to bring a potluck dish in my heart shaped cookware!
5,one of the best,Delsey Helium Luggage is one of the best on the market.Not only it is best value but you cannot find a lighter and stronger luggage at any price.It is a quality product and I am certainly going to buy their products again when needed.Lifetime warranty is an additional benefit as well.
3,"Awesome, except the analog stick","This controller, in my opinion, is a lot better than the original N64 brand, mostly because of the turbo feature. I've had it for six years, which is a long time, yes, but I hardly ever used it until recently. So now, six years later, I pull it out of it's box, but the analog stick is messed up. It won't go down or left without pulling up or right first. This gets very annoying during racing games, which is why I still have my other ones."
2,eh....,the joy stick is very touchy makes things hard to get use to other than that it seems to be ok just gotta get use to flicking the joy stick instead of holding onto it
4,One of their better albums,"My favorite Night Ranger albums are Dawn Patrol, Midnight Madness and Seven Wishes. I didn't particularly care for Big Life, Man In Motion or Feeding off the Mojo. Neverland was better, though still not as good as their first three. Seven however is much better than anything since Seven Wishes. It's not quite as hard or as fast as the first two albums but it's close."
4,Seven,"I started buying just a few of the MP3s because I didn't like the sound bites but eventually downloaded most of them, then, I bought the physical CD (because my stereo won't play iTunes recorded CDs). I smile when I see the album picture shows up on my iTouch because I know the song will be funny and sarcastic as well as kick-ass. Kong makes me laugh so give it a chance!"
4,Very good come back album,"I've been a Ranger fan since the instant I heard Don't Tell Me You love Me on the radio for the first time. One of the favorite concerts of theirs I saw was an outdoor show in the middle of downtown Minneapolis a few years ago. It was very cool to hear them echo through the streets and buildings.I bought this album when it came out, and I kinda expected it to be just so-so, but was pleasantly surprised and happy to hear the opening ripping tune. And the rest was pretty good too, its a CD I can put in and listen to all the way through easily. Their first album is still my favorite, but this one is pretty good."
4,VERY GOOD!,"Free and uncopromising, Night Ranger gave us a fantastic recording, mayber their best till now. The songs are full of fun and good rock'n roll, the lyrics are good-humored. I missed Jeff Watson compositions in this one."
5,Just what I asked for,"This game is so awesome, to espcially have it in your possesion instead of going to Nathans and paying 50 cent a game. It brings back so many memories and it was great doing business with kewloldstuffforyou! Thank you for making my childhood live again"
4,Lasik for me......,"Reading this book before having the Lasik procedure on my eyes was like having the opportunity to chat with my doctor for days before the surgery. Of course, there is not a doctor these days that can spend that much time with each patient..... so if you are thinking on Lasik for your eyes..... this book will help you to understand your case and to and make a good decision before the surgery. Good luck!"
4,cool shoe!,"I really fell in love with these the moment I saw them. I have really weird feet, and with a blister stick, and some strategically placed dr scholls cushy shoes things, have made the shoe quite comfortable. The heel is very walkable and sturdy. Fryes whole line has been quite interesting the past few seasons!"
4,Nice Watch,"I have had this watch 5 years and it still works and looks great. Five years without replacing a battery! It isn't a Rolex, but a quality watch for the price."
4,"""An intoxicating set of retro-rock originals!""","Poor Little Fools successfully combine rock, swing, pop and even honky-tonk style country in this debut outing."
3,Not the same old thing and not something new and interesting,"Although this CD is slowly growing on me, it does not have the same impact, feeling of expansiveness, or mystical air that David Parsons' earlier music has. It is almost as if he had to release a CD to fulfill a record contract and this pasting together and mixing of sounds was hastily created to meet this obligation. It really isn't very creative or interesting. Although I will listen to Yatra and Dorje Ling for years to come and still love them, this new CD will only gather dust."
5,A Truly Celestial Music,"David Parsons lives upto his expecations. He joins the ranks of othe New Age Wizards like Anugama, Dueter and others. We have to commend him for his skilful handling of the east-east fusion. The perfect use of native instruments has enhanced its ambience and brings out the natural beauty associated with the sounds unique to those instruments e.g the ""Sarangi"". In ""Tjampuhan"", every note falls rightly into a another note forming a spiraling continuum. I really got addicted to this particular piece and listen to it every morning. A refreshing music for relaxation especially in the mornings. Though I will exploring some of his other works, I strongly recommend this CD to anyone interested in ambient music."
1,A weak overview,This is a weak overview for people who know nothing about art. One could write 3-4 books on the info left out of this book. A big letdown. Didn't cover U.S. art during the war in any meaningful way.
3,Heart of a Warrior,"Here is where the cover artwork started making Casca looking like Fabio in romance novels. Great artwork, but bad rendition when others were so spot-on.Anyway, this was a interesting, albeit sometimes dull, novel. Casca is shipwrecked on an island of cannibals. Fighting and surviving like a savage, (I love this kind've stuff!), was the good part of the story. But it just didn't have that ebb and flow that it should've. Like Barry was running out of time and/or gas.The most memorable part is when Casca has to eat a fried penis of his slain enemy. It is an insult to the cannibal chieftan if not done, believed to instill the slain warrior's strength into one's soul if consumed. The details still stick to me this very day, 14 years later."
3,Good but not great,"Okay, Trunks is finally on the series but it is still terrible.Funimation might show more scenes on the uncut version but believe me,the dubbing is awful."
5,"A Brief Version of ""Value Based Fees"" - worth the read","In my mind, this book is little more than an earlier version of Alan Weiss's ""Value Based Fees: How to Charge and Get What Your Worth."" Even so, I found it worthwhile and worth the time I spent on it.In fact, if you want to review value-priced strategies, reading this little booklet on ""How To Maximize Fees"" is the quickest and easiest way to remind yourself of what you can do to offer greater value in your consulting practice and get paid for it.The book does not have as much ""theory"" as Alan's other books. Which might make it a stretch for you if you are just learning the concepts."
1,Horrible!,"The book is readable within an hour and offers some of the worst advise I've ever seen. There are three central themes to the book: Drop long-term, lower paying clients; Add new clients at higher fees (""Maximized""), and never lower your fees unless the client perceives he's receiving less in return. If you want to spend $6.95 to receive this advice--send the money to me."
5,Fudge,"Super good and easy to make for the Holidays, on time and enjoyed by all.Happy Holidays and thank you"
1,BEWARE! Contains partially hydrogenated oil...BAD for health!,"Of course my fault, because they do have the ingredients listed. I gave it all to a food bank. Thought about throwing it away but realize that maybe others may want to eat it. What a quandry as they may or may not know that it contains hydrogenated oil which is so bad for our health. :( There are alternative brownies brands on here that do not contain that....YAYYYY for those companies that offer quality products with quality ingredients!"
4,Impressive Tribute to the Best Band of the Last 20 Years,"Cocteau Twins fans will be pleasantly surprised by this loving tribute. Most tracks are faithful to the originals, effortlessly appropriating the Twins' distinctive style--right down to Elizabeth Fraser's otherworldly chanting (though Jennifer Hope actually deciphered the lyrics to ""Seekers Who Are Lovers"" and enunciates all of them). Faith and Disease's ""Amelia"" is difficult to tell from the original, while The Autumns' ""Garlands"" is sung by a guy (the only male voice on the album). Non-Cocteau fans probably won't get much out of this album (and they should head straight for the original albums immediately), but the converted will find a lot to savor here."
1,Sorry but you cannot attempt to replicate the Cocteau Twins,"im sure this compilation was done with the best intentions but as a die hard cocteau twins fanwho regards their music as nothing less than Divine. it would be very hard for anyone to attempt to do their music justice do yourself a favor listen to the real thing,i recommend albums treasureTreasure, the pink opaque, the moon and the melodies, and garlands you will be eternally seduced by their music as I have for over 25 yrs"
1,Liking the Cocteau Twins does NOT mean you'll like this...,"Though I have a deep and abiding love for the music of the Cocteau Twins, this thudding, gothic tribute takes away the subtle, careful loveliness of the songs. Hearing other versions of their songs ~ especially these overly-mixed, unoriginal, lackluster versions ~ just affirms to me that not only are the Twins excellent musicians, but that perhaps sometimes imitators need not bother. If this is a summary of gothic music, then the Cocteau Twins transcend the gothic genre; what this compilation does is pull the music back down and make it tawdry."
3,Just OK,"Seems like this collection was just thrown together without too much thought. There are a few really good cuts, so give a listen."
2,First use didn't go so great!,"So far, we've used this once in a public place and it didn't fit the toilet. I was afraid of this after reading previous reviews and it happened to me too. I managed to carefully balance and hold a scared toddler (my daughter) to minimize the situation. Does not work on public toilets well - and there a NO changing that!!!!"
3,Baby won't sit on it,"This is as advertised, but turned out to be pretty useless for us. My 2 year old won't go near it. He doesn't like the way it sits on the end of the toilet, and keeps wanting to push it back so it's in the middle. Of course, it doesn't work that way. Plus, it feels a little flimsy and that makes him nervous. He actually prefers to balance himself on the potty without anything at all. I still carry this for public bathroom emergencies, but some sort of disposable protector or cover will probably work better for us."
1,Pinched his bum!,"I read all the reviews and decided to give this seat a try anyway. Did everything properly, but the seat slid around and then pinched my son's bum when he sat down because it flexed when he put his weight on it. It was worth a try, but I wouldn't recommend this seat, or any like it, for that matter."
4,Great travel potty seat,"I got this seat for my 22 month old son who decided to train himself but whose skinny little bottom will fall into ANY potty. He took a little getting used to it as it flexes a little and where the plastic comes together there is a little bump that was unnerving for him. BUT, he is used to it now and I take it everywhere. He usually unfolds it and puts it on the potty (close anyway) himself. I also bought a folding step stool and have them both in my used to be diaper bag...we are all set now!"
1,Dangerous Product!,This product caused a significant laceration on my 2-year-olds bottom the 2nd time the seat was used. Please do not try this with your child- just in case the same thing happens! Pinches horribly! Do not purchase!!!!!
1,Not so good.,"I purchased this for my potty training toddler, but it does not fit our standard toilet, placed on the front as the directions state, it leaves a large gap at the back which is not supported and looks very unsafe. I wouldn't even let him try it."
2,Good idea but will sag on a larger seat when 3 year old is on it,This is a great idea with handles and all but it doesnt have the stability sometimes when used on public toilet that has reasonable sized opening. It folds and will buckle under the pressure if not held while my son is on it. He is 2 years old and about 30 lbs.It moves a bit and the front opening closes so he sometimes pee's on it due to the horseshoe opening pinches together.
2,You're better off simply teaching good hand washing...,"This seat has never sat right on any toilet I have encountered and actually made my son frightened to use it. It would shift and semi-collapse in use if my son squirmed and all in all made potty trips a bad experience.However, I think the same rings true about any folding seat cover since I have used about every one on the market and they all have the same flaws.I say if you are really worried about germs in public restrooms either use a non-folding seat or steer clear of them. Or just do what I did and make sure your child knows how to properly wash his/her hands after using the restroom."
1,do not buy,"This does not fit any toilet. My daughter would not use it after it pinched her behind. It is for round toilets and every place I went has oval toilets. Good concept, but they need to redesign for oval toilets."
2,cheap and not that good,"The edge is sharp, my son has red marks on his legs every times he sit on it. I know it's cheap, I get what I pay for, but I still wish it could be a little more comfortable for kid."
2,Better products out there,"The seat easily folds and unfolds, but other than that does not have much going for it.This seat angles my kids very far back on the toilet so that their feet are dangling on the front part of a public toilet.The back fold meets them right at the butt, which is very uncomfortable for them so that they don't want to sit on the seat.It is also just generally wobbly and unstable. And looks like it will buckle inward at any moment and leave them stranded in the toilet.We are returning it for a Potette 2 in 1, hopefully we will have better luck there."
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for the portable potty seat, but was disappointed it is NOT user friendly. It took four tries to get my daughter on the seat without the seat shifting or folding in. I now know you have to lift the child high above the seat and gently place her down right on top because it shifts off the toilet. At the same time you have to hold the seat because it wants to fold in on itself (very weak). In fairness I have to say it may have been the shape of the toilet. I was at Target at the time. Who knows?"
2,Not for Heavy Weight Division,"My baby is in the 99th percentile in weight and height, he just turned two. I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart, I used it correctly and my poor son collapsed it 90% of the time, I tried all different positions and no matter what it buckled. This is a great idea for children below the 50th percentile, any more than that I say keep looking. It isn't fun fishing your kid out of a public toilet."
3,I didn't really need this,"When I began potty training my two year old I stocked up on the goods. I got a travel potty (GREAT!) star chart, etc... I popped this thing in my purse a few times... but it is so un nessesary. I probably wouldn't buy this again. BUT... it held up very well, fit all toilets, and if you need a potty seat for traveling longer term then it's worth it (but don't be lame like me and bring it into the grocery store with you). Doesn't pintch and the treds keep it in place."
1,I used it for the first time almost a year later,I used it today now that my daughter is 2 and a half. The seat slid so my daughter almost fell to the floor. I was surprised how unsafe this item is
3,Disappointed at 1st sight...Ziplock bag,"We just got it and (going by sight alone), it's very flimsy. Also, the carrying case is just an oversized ziplock bag. I hope it works better than it looks. I was expecting more. Will write more if it works better than it looks/packaged."
4,One of the better ones,Overall this is a good product. It works well with pretty much all seats just make sure u store it in a large zip log bag to avoid spreading germs.
3,too unsturdy...child does not feel comfortable,"My son feels too unstable on this seat (even with me holding the seat in place), so he won't go #2 on it. Great idea..but we're having accidents when we use this seat because of not feeling secure enough to sit long enough to have results!"
3,"Eh, didnt use for long",I bought this thinking we would use it all the time when we were out and about. But the bottom line is it's just too bulky and my daughter got the hang of going on the potty without it when we're out and about. I found thick adhesive paper potty seat covers which are easy to throw in any purse and eliminate the ickiness of public potties.
3,PRIMO potty seat,"This product appears as it is described and does fold nicely to fit into a diaper bag. However, when I tried to use it with my 3 year old on a public toilet, it folded inward and didn't look like it would hold him well. It didn't help with encouraging potty use to say the least. I don't recall a weight limit, but my son is approximately 30 pounds."
3,Better than nothing...,"I use this seat, mostly for when we are out. It is nice that my girl does not have to sit on the bare toilet seat. It will slip around some, so I have to be very careful when I put her on it. This is even with the seat carefully placed all of the way to the front of the toilet. I looked at many options and saw the complaints about all of these types of seats, and you do have to be careful with them. That said, I am glad I bought it."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet. We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar. It is not! It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place. She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing! I would not purchase this product."
2,It works on some seats,"It is not perfect, but it does the job. Never had a pinching issue like I had read about. fitting on public seats is an issue because most are oblong and this is designed for round seats. Works fine for boys and girls, we keep in a ziploc bag."
4,Great as a portable seat on the go!,"The seat is exactly what I hoped it would be for the potty training boy. The only thing I can say is not great is that there is no splash shield so the boy can cause some spills if you aren't careful. Otherwise, I recommend this product to anyone that needs a portable seat for the kiddo to use when utilizing a public restroom."
2,Doesn't quite fit public toilets,"Seems like a good idea, but it doesn't quite fit on many public toilet seats. It does fold up, but is still a bit bulky in the diaper bag since I cart around stuff for a baby as well. Great idea, but not quite right."
5,Won't leave home w/out it!,"After reading all the other reviews and researching the different folding potty seats available, I chose this one due to price and the postive reviews. I definitely picked the right one! I'm glad the other reviews stated that it needs to be placed at the front of the toilet because I have no problem using it on any size potty, even the one at the park! It is simple and secure and I feel so much better using a public restroom when I have it with me. Haven't had any pinching issues but I'm careful to prevent them, as I saw some other users had that problem. I actually bought two thinking if I like it, I could give it to a friend who has little ones starting to use the big potty. I'm glad I did because I think everyone should have one of these!"
4,Brilliant!,"I LOVE this product. I have a little girl and this definitely takes the ""eeww"" out of taking her to a public restroom. I've also taken it to the park and it fits on those toilets too. I only wish the bag it came in was better. It comes in a ziplock bag."
4,Good seat for little bottoms!,"This is a good portable potty seat for little bottoms. It has a wide seat, handles and folds easily. I would have given it 5 stars but the advertised max weight capacity says 35 lbs. My 3.5 year old is about 36lbs, so technically its not for her :("
3,It's okay,"We only used the seat a few times because my son was to afraid to go on the big potty without a seat. There are a few flaws in the seat though.1) It doesn't fit every style of toilet, so it can shift and slide around2) The whole sanitary issue is hard to deal with.I found after I would use it I would spend an additional 5 minutes in the public bathroom wiping down the underside with clorox wipes I carried with me before re-folding it and placing it in a carrying bag.I suppose it would be good for parents who travel a lot. It just wasn't a great product for us."
3,Not as great as I thought it would be.,"I bought this for my 26 month old son who just got potty trained for when we are out and about. He is an average size 2 year old and I feel the seat is a little flimsy but it does the job. He complained he got a ""boo boo"" when he sat on it but I think he just got scared because it was new to him. The seat is made were the folds are boo boo proof. I think my son was just used to his soft seat we use at home. Overall it is ok. I would recommend it for children who wont/can't sit on the regular potty."
3,Decent Potty Seat for the Price,"We have the PRI folding potty with handles and also the Potette 2 in 1. This potty cover folds well, and fits into my purse. However, it can be unstable, especially when placing the child onto it. Once the child sits down, it won't move around or slip b/c of the plastic gulp. My 2.5 years old uses the handle part every time. She doesn't like using the Potette when it sits on top of the toilet. She only uses the potette when it sits alone on the floor. So we keep the potette in our car mostly."
5,exactly what you need,"This thing is perfect. I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say it's hard to use. It easily fits on any toilet we've tried, and man, have we tried it on a bunch of toilets. This is hands-down the most used and most useful product I bought as part of potty training. A friend bought one of the cuter ones, and it pinches her daughter's bottom, but the way the hinges are on this one means it does not do that. My son is small, but it held up even after he bounced on it trying to make himself fall in. Also, I wouldn't have realized this ahead of time, but he really does use the handles to push down on while he goes. It's super light, easy to fold, fits well in my purse, and to me is a must-have."
1,Not impressed,This product has yet to fit well on any toilet we've tried it on. It slides around. It's very flimsy and my son is scared to sit on it because he doesn't feel safe. This product isn't worth the money.
1,Thought this would work but it didn't,I bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it DOESN'T FIT AT ALL! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don't get it for travel as it doesn't work for that.
1,don't waste your time,I bought this seat thinking it would be great for us because we travel a lot. I ended up throwing it away. It does not hold up my two year old and is made out of cheap plastic.
2,there are better portable potties out there,"I found that this potty was easy to unfold, but had gaps between where they pieces connect, making it very easy for a child to get pinched. Also, I put it on my toilet, and put a bit of weight on it, and it bowed easily, so I was very worried about putting my child on it. Especially since I had gone back and read other negative reveiws on it. We ended up getting a regular potty seat and putting it in the car. It fits in the bottom of the stroller, so I always have it with me."
3,Serves its purpose...ish,"Serves its purpose as my stepdaughter is not fond of public toilet seats, however, its not very sturdy because of all the bumps and ridges on the back. It fits just fine on a normal toilet seat, but the grooves on the back do not fit a standard public toilet seat. It works, but would work better with just some rubber gripping and no grooves."
2,Just not Sturdy Enough for my 27 pounder,"I thought this foldable seat was such a good idea, but it just didn't seem stable enough for my little munchkin. It kind of bends a little when she sits on it and it makes her feel insecure. It's unfortunate because now I have to lug around a full sized potty seat (just the top part, not a whole setup). I understand her fears because it really does look like she might ""fall in"". Oh well, I tried. :)"
2,disappointing,"I bought this for my two-year-old son to use in public restrooms. It got the best reviews of the portable potties I was looking at. I have a BOY, so there needs to be some kind of guard or something there or he pees all over the bathroom stall. Not only that, but because of where the handles are located, he can't spread his legs very far apart, so he's really just aiming for the floor. The seams don't pinch and it does hold his weight (28 pounds), but it's not the best solution for a little boy. Skip it and just help them sit on the toilet."
1,Not sturdy enough,"The kids never felt like they weren't going to fall in. Tested it out, but was never able to put it to use."
2,no go,I was so excited to find a portable- easy to fit in the diaper bag-potty seat. But it just has too much 'give' and my child is just frightened sitting on it. I'll be packin' the sturdier - non folding variety from now on.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets.My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping.I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast. Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels.I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat. He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor.He was bleeding.THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!!This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him.We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,not best for boys,"My son used this several times & wet all over the floor each time. There is no splash guard on it for boys, but it probably works fine for girls."
3,Not very stable,"When my 3 year old daughter, who only weighs 26 pounds, sat on it, it tended to cave in a bit to where she felt like she was falling in. We tried it on several different toilets but still did not feel very stable."
4,Does it's job,"This potty seat does it's job. It's small enough that it fits in my 2.5 year old's diaper bag along with an extra set of clothes, a few diapers, wipes, snacks, etc. He has used it successfully a few times and seems to be ok with it. I wish it were a bit more sturdy, but it is a foldable, portable potty seat after all. For the price, and for what it is, it is totally worth it!"
2,Not as hoped,"Love La Mer so bought this CD. La Mer far and away only track I will listen to again! The others seem like jolly holiday songs to make you giggle, of course if my french were better they may be so much more. If you love La Mer but don't speak french buy a compilation CD"
2,La Mer,"I bought it because the music, La Mer, by Charles Trenet, was the background of the movie, Mr Bean on Holiday. The particular song brought back memories, but the remainder of the disc was less inspiring"
3,Why haven't they gotten it right yet?,"In short- this is a good compilation of Christian Music Videos- only lately they have gone from being 'fun' to more 'art' based. Look at the Switchfoot video of last year- not much like here. Admitedly, the Jump5 music video is a great one for the genre. Also the GRITS one has a flavor of its own, the TobyMac one has a distict flow, but can Rebecca St. James ever do something more than sing to the camera? Oh, honestly, the ZOEgirl one is good too. Buy it if you want the best of music videos for LAST year (2002), and pray that God sets some of the creative talent free in 2003."
3,WOW CD's dishonest!,"I purchased the Wow Hits and Wow Christmas CD's in December with their ""$...rebate"" promotion. I have never received the rebate. COUNTLESS emails and letters and attempts to contact them have yielded NO RESPONSE from them. [Avoid] this dishonest company!"
5,every Christian must have,"If you love contemporary Christian music and praise & worship music, this has to find it's way into your CD collection. I listen to this over and over and never tire of it. There are so many artists and such a wonderful selection of music on the CD that if I was stuck on a desert isle with only 1...okay this is a 2 CD set, so if I only had 2 CDs to take to my island, I'd pick the blue & silver CDs from WOW 2003. Trust me, it's worth the $... you'll shell out for it."
2,Angel Cake disaster,I purchased a case of angelfood cake and the first three I baked didn't turn out very well. I ended up giving the other three boxes away.
4,Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Physics 2006-2007 (Kaplan Sat Subject Test. Physics),"Good test, but I should like to see more question with real live."
5,Pictures say more than 1000 words,"This book ties human interactions beautifully with everyday pictures. It is not a book for a person who wants to read or get direct knowledge, rather it is a book for the observer, the person who learns from everyday newances.It did change my perspective on Human Interactions with surrounding objects and environments. I do believe this book is meant to provoke and inspire towards observing more carefully."
2,author could have improved overall,"Overall concept is interesting. What we observe, how we are conditioned, how we respond to our environment but quality of book could have been taking further. Instead of being paperback size, it could have been a larger coffee table book with higher quality photos to illustrate points. Rather than having to refer to back of book to understand why image was included, it should have been on the same page as the picture."
4,Primer on the power of observation,"This was a good overview/introduction to leveraging observational research in design and innovation thinking, not an in-depth treatise on process nor a how-to instruction manual. Reading the negative reviews, I somewhat agree that there could be more ""meat"" in the book, or that the author could have positioned the insights/questions with the photos to create a more usable work. However, I realized that perhaps it was intentional that the observational photos were positioned without explanation in the first half of the book, with narrative in the back. That's how observations typically happen, relying on each one's personal reflection and evaluation first, unskewed by external opinion. I appreciated this book as an inspiration to tune into the obvious around us and by capturing the everyday, learn to gain insight into it's ability to shape the creation of future things. Good stuff."
1,Title and Topic is Irrelevant,"While a fan of IDEO design group, this book is more personal photo journal (and a bad one at that), than a guide for creative interaction. This book is testament to Jane's hubris and not a contribution to design. Too bad and I'm personally sorry I spent the money."
5,MAGNIFIC !,"This is certainly the best Saxon live material. It was recorded in 1995 during the Dogs of War tour. It incorporates the new guitarrist Doug Scarrat, which plays (very well) the guitar parts originally played by Graham Oliver, although in my pessoal opinion I prefer the style of Graham Oliver. The band is very well tuned, with powerfull guitars. The quality of this recording is amazing ! In my opinion, the high point of this double live recording are the tracks ""Crusader"" (With a magnific guitar solo by Paul Quinn), ""Ain't gonna take it"" (With an amazing and powerfull guitar riff), ""The great white buffalo'' and ""The eagle has landed""(With a powerfull guitar riff too). There are too a great guitar solo by Paul Quinn on the introduction of the track ""Princess of the night"", a guitar solo by Doug Scarrat on the introduction of the track ""Wheels of steel"", and a bass solo of Nibbs Carter on the introduction of ""Crash Dive"". All Saxon fan must have this recording, pure heavy metal !"
4,back to what they do best,"after flirting with pop rock in the eighties, it's good to hear a new release by saxon that takes them back to the driving energetic style that put them in the same class as iron maiden and other big names in british metal. they always have been able to crunch with the best of 'em and this new release is a prime example of just that. if you like classic saxon, then you're gonna love this offering."
4,Great ear wash for my cocker spaniel!,"I have used this ear wash on my cocker spaniel since she was a puppy and she has only had one ear infection (she is now 7 years old). I apply it on a rolled up cotton round in each of my dog's ears once a week. And although it doesn't smell the best (minus the one star), the tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial and keeps my dog's ears clean and free of infection (which is a feat with cocker spaniel ears which provide a perfect incubator for bacteria)."
4,Murder mystery..,"Very nice little crime novel, well written and a pleasant read. Nothing that is over the top violent or graphic. Just a good old whodunnit with a main character who is sympathethic and yet totally low key. I enjoyed it, perhaps because the writer didn't need to creat any cheap thrills to keep my attention. It was sort of like a Jessica Fletcher except without the old lady, or B actors or cheesy scripts. Ok maybe Murder She Wrote is a bad example. I loved the simplicity of it. The only minor issue was that some of the formatting was slighty off, only the occasional sentence nothing majorly disruptive to the flow of the text."
5,Really Good!,"I enjoyed this murder mystery very much. I had just finished a book that was difficult to read. I am so glad this was an easy read! The plot line is good, the characters are well-developed and believable, and the writing is enjoyable. Recommend."
5,I liked it,"There's a bit of very mild swearing; just a few random words. Also a reference to having sex, but it's not graphic. I would read it again. I liked it. Don't judge it on the first chapter alone."
3,Eyeshot falls a little short of first rate.,"Julia Winchell is missing but she has left behind enough clues to solve her own disappearance as well as the death of another woman more than eight years before. Cincinnati police specialist Sonora Blair, short on both personality and brains, is merely along for the ride. Following the trail Julia Winchell has already blazed, she bungles the investigation on more than one occasion. The killer seems to be toying with her, he is understandably unimpressed with her sleuthing. In fact it looks like he is planning another murder right under the detective's nose.Not as gritty and well plotted as a Cornwall thriller and without the excellent character development of a Laura King mystery, this book just limps along dogedly from start to finish."
3,Bloody Murder,"I followed the Coral Watts story in the Houston papers and on tv at the time it was unfolding. The first half of this book is okay. But, it is so badly padded, I got pretty bored. I guess I am in the minority here."
2,Disappointing,"While the story is interesting, the book is not. It's much longer than necessary because so much gets repeated over and over. The author seems to have a personal bias against the Houston Police Department and is resentful that Court TV did not cover the trial in Michigan the way he thought they should. No information is given about Watts's background to indicate why he might have become the person he did. Way too many pages are devoted to his ""confessions"" in Texas; all are given verbatim and all sound the same. I stuck with it until page 324, then gave up. There are many good articles and pictures available on the Internet. I don't think I'll be reading more books by Mitchell."
2,DISLIKED BOOK,"I FEEL SORRY FOR THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES, BUT THIS BOOK WAS BORING. I GOT 1/2 THROUGH IT AND PUT IT DOWN. I'M TRULY GLAD THAT MR. WATTS GOT WHAT HE DESERVED!"
5,Definite Page Turner,"I could not put this book down. The author does a great job introducing the reader to the victims as well as Coral Watts. It is obvious that the book is well researched. However, it goes way beyond the facts. It makes you feel anger, sorrow, and hopefullness. I have read all of Corey Mitchell's books. I have liked all of them, but this one is definitely the best."
4,Rockpile's Back,"Billy Bremner was the odd-man-out in the legendary -- and short lived -- Rockpile, the Nick Lowe-Dave Edmunds supergroup of the late 1970s. After Rockpile disintegrated, Bremner released a disappointing solo effort called Bash -- so unnecessary that the LP was never released in the U.S.Now comes ""A Good Week's Work"" -- so name because the CD was purportedly recorded in the course of seven days -- which rekindles the Rockpile flame. The record is filled with Rockpile-esque ""Pure Pop"", punctuated by Bremner's solos are very reminiscent of his ""Seconds of Pleasure"" work. Here's hoping ex-mates Lowe and Edmunds will hear this new CD and be inspired to revisit their old sound -- maybe even a Rockpile reunion? Please!!"
4,"With great picture, and widescreen, this sword and sanal Flic should be Just the thing for your Collection","Steve Reeves never looked better in this excellent Widescreen version, The same company that put this one out also has put out , Hercules, samson and Ullysses... also in Widescreen . this one with Kirk Morris as Hercules. Both of these would be great addsions to your Collection"
1,Should have read the reviews,Absolutely no English subtitles. Since it's streaming there's no way to download English subtitles. A warning on the main screen telling you what language the movie is in would be really helpful Amazon.
1,"Afrique, Je te Plumerai",It simply did not live up to expectations. I was expecting something more along the lines of the colonial effort. This was not very well done. It was an examination into the literature available in books written in various languages which are libraries and cultural centers operated by former colonial powers.
5,"A great peek at Lennon, circa 1970","An in-depth interview with John Lennon, on the eve of the release of his Plastic Ono Band album. Much of the material covered is similar to that of the 1980 Playboy Interviews, but with ten years between them, these are certainly distinctly different interviews. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this book is that we get a knee-jerk reaction from Lennon to the dissolution of The Beatles, as well as his thoughts on each member and their work directly following. While some other topics (Lennon and Ono's events for peace, politics, etc.) are discussed, the majority of conversation here is centered around music, be it the Beatles, Lennon, the Stones, Dylan, or others. A great read, recommended for any Lennon fan."
5,Lennon in his own words...,"I first read this collection of interviews with John Lennon back in the early 1970s when I was 14 years old and it had a powerful impact on me. Lennon mixes his discussions with hard words and strong opinions. I had never read language like that before. This is pure, unadulterated Lennon. His anger spoke to my own anger as a teenager in those times. The history he conveys is well known now but, back then, we knew next to nothing about the early days of the Liverpool bands. Essential reading for anyone interested in the Beatles and their era."
3,I Felt Betrayed,"My sister got this book for me for my birthday. When I read it , I realized that something every fishy was going on: namely, that editor Jann Wenner had conveniently REMOVED almost anything controversial or objectionable that Lennon had to say, anything that could cost him a fan or two. What we have here is a cleaned-up version of the interviews with a lot of the offensive and rawest stuff excised. Save your money, go on E-Bay and try to get copies of the interviews as they were ORIGINALLY published in Rolling Stone.;The differences will be obvious; BTW Lennon himself was so furious that Wenner had edited out his ""rough parts"" that the two did not speak for years.;"
2,Innaccurate portrayal of Lennon.,"John Lennon later stated to producer George Martin that he ""was off his head in the seventies"",so this interview should be taken as innacurate history.Given that this was the time that John Lennon spent time in a bag,had a bed-in and released an ""album"" which consisted of chanting and passing wind and had a photo of yoko and himself naked on the front,these were his crazy years.Paul and George didn't despise Yoko,they just resented her turning up for recording sessions and influencing John to do rubbish like ""revolution number 9""."
3,A Strange Man,"Lennon was a brilliant songwriter, but I have much more respect for McCartney as a person. While John complained about being a Beatle, he nonetheless didn't complain about the advantages that being one brought him in notoriety, a forum to air his political grievances, and the ability to bring a nominal ""artist"" to the forefront, Yoko Ono.This book is a self indulgant excercise, one that is wrought with contradictions and mis-information. For example, Lennon didn't write the melody to ""In My Life."" McCartney did. Also, ""Elenaour Rigby"" was completed when McCartney brought it to the studio.In many cases, John felt threatened by Paul's popularity and ease in dealing with people. Rather than deal with his one problems, he lashed out at others. Strange."
2,review for grasshoppers dont eat grapes,"I m sorry to say that I was never able to view this message,we inserted the vhs into the player and it quickly wrappeditself around the inside of our vhs player need less to saythe tape was torn, it was a job just to remove it... sorryI can not give a good review because obviously the productwas defective... when I have this type of experience I trynot to use the seller again"
2,Not exactly what I have imagine,"I was waiting excited for the cake to arrive but after tasting it, it was not how is supposed to be. I will have second thought to purchase cake on line in the future"
1,Flamigni Sacher Torta,The item arrived on time. The flavor might have been better if it was fresh. All I know is that the cake tasted stale. Very disappointed with my purchase. Not seeking a refund because this may be a subjective thing.
4,A good mix to listen to before hitting the nightclubs,"Trance music is by far my favorite sub-genre in dance music. I love the melodies and most of the time ethereal vocals that accompanies the song. I rarely buy mix cds anymore though. There really isn't anything that hasn't been done already. I was going through my cd collection when I came upon ""Trance Global Nation Vol. 2"". I had bought this cd used at my favorite record store. I thought I would put it in. Nicholas Bennison is by no means anywhere as good as George Acosta or Sandra Collins but he does a fairly competent job at mixing the music. At least he succeeds in mixing the songs to flow together in a cohesive sound. The songs may be fairly dated (try 4-5 years ago) but they represent everything that I love about trance music. I particularly love tracks #1 and #3. They have a good beat as well as a good melody structure to the song. I feel like I am in a nightclub while listening to the cd."
3,In Moderation...,"Nicholas Bennison does nice work, but this album simply isn't his best. There's clearly an attempt to mix in new and lesser-known music, but it gets ruined by greater popularity that the same artists have received elsewhere (Push, Greece 2000, PVD, Energy 52). There's some good effort in building up the momentum (Jimpy, Ron Hagen), but it falls flat on the tracks that follow. Altogether it's an interesting album to bum from your friend so you can hear Jimpy's ""What a Day"", Ron Hagen & Pascal M's ""Dream of the Sirens"" and Viridian's ""Sunhump"" - energetic and danceable, yet not too hard, percussion-happy mixes of house and trance . However, considering the later releases of this series, it may be a worthy collectible if TranceGlobalNation keeps moving in the same direction."
5,wow,"quite simply, this is an amazing album. this is a must-buy for those who are trance veterans as well as for new comers to the genre. i put the album in my cd player and listened through it all the way through in one sitting the first time. i almost never do that. get this. get this now."
5,"Good, but be carefull ...","This set on Hypnotic is the SAME as ""The World of Goa Trance Volume 3"" on ZYX (CDDB will even report it as the latter)."
3,"Decent, but there are better trance albums out there","Yes, the music on this collection is fast and purely electronic as advertised on the cover. For some reason though, it doesn't have the same impact as some of the more recent trance/acid compilations. If you like fast trance techno, feel free to take a chance on this 2 CD set...it's actually not that bad. There are a few quality tracks on it. I still recommend Astral Projection's ""In The Mix"" compilation as the best in this genre of music, but ""This Is Goa Trance"" is a decent buy for those of looking for an additional fix."
4,If you like blues rock or just guitar rock you need this,"I discovered Mark Selby last fall when he opened for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd band here in town, and immediately decided I had to have his CD. At the time I had no idea that he wrote for KWSB, but his performance was absolutely incredible - I'm not even sure how to put it in words. The only thing I was dissapointed in was that his live performance was MUCH better than the CD - the music on the CD almost sounds like he's holding back in comparison to what I heard the first time. Even with that said though, this guy rocks. Buy it. :)"
5,"WOW, EVERY CUT IS SPECIAL",IF YOU LIKE THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA INFLUENCES IN BANDS LIKE LYNYRD SKYNYRD AND BLACKFOOT AND EVEN ACOUSTIC GREGG ALLMAN YOU'RE GOING TO BE CRYING FOR JOY AFTER HEARING THIS ALBUM TWICE. SOUTHERN BLUES -NOTHING BEATS IT. I HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF GARY ROSSINGTON AND RICKY MEDLOCKE STYLINGS. THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 NATIONAL STEEL ACOUSTIC SONGS-ALL VERY GOOD. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS ANOTHER CASE OF A GREAT NEW ARTIST HAVING A STELLAR DEBUT ALBUM. IF THIS IS YOU'RE STYLE OF MUSIC YOU KNOW IT IS VERY RARE TO FIND NEW MATERIAL AND ARTISTS. ENJOY!
4,Almost essential,"I first heard Mark Selby live on NPR as I drove from New Orleans to Houston. The guy knocked me out. A little bit Van Morrison, a little Bob Seger, a little ZZ Top--this guy is a fine companion on the road! I think he's created a valuable, enjoyable--almost essential--CD for fans of original rock and blues. Keep your ears open for more."
1,"Sorry, guys, but...","I couldn't finish this book. I found the heroine extremely immature and annoying, especially for her age. And it was just too cute and kitschy for my taste."
4,"Great, except for the marriage part...","Kendrick was one of a kind, a handsome, decent man, and although Genevieve was wonderful too, the story took a drastic downward turn right after they got married. The way she avoided the 'marriage bed' was simply unbelievable. Stupid, in fact. And for a while, the story became boring because of it. It just made for a weak story line. I could see a bit of apprehension on her part, but days of it? On their honeymoon? When they finally had the castle to themselves for a couple weeks? Silly. And being a virgin at age 30 is not impossible to concede, but the fact that Genevieve knew absolutely nothing about kissing a man was too unbelievable.Ms Kurland sometimes makes her heroines too goody-goody."
3,A FRACTURED FAIRY TALE...,"This is a fairytale for adults. Though not particularly well written, it is, nonetheless, a humorous and inventive story of a modern day virgin who inherits a castle and her very own ghost. The ghost is literally a knight in shining armor. This handsome and charming thirteenth century knight is doomed to haunt the halls of this castle keep for all eternity, unless he can persuade a descendant of the woman who consigned him to his fate to sign the castle over to him. Needless to say, the ghost and this twentieth century maiden fall in love. What happens to them is sure to delight readers of romance novels everywhere."
3,Not a clean Kurland,I love Kurland because she is a clean romance author. This book was not clean like her others so I was a little sad. I liked the over all book and was able to skip over the parts that I didn't want to read.
