3,Not bad,I liked this watch for its simplicity but the plastic snapped within a year and I had to toss it.
5,Quick Shipping and Exactly what I ordered.,I was happy to received my order and it was shipped to me on the date they promised. I will order again from them.
3,low-fi fantasia,"I was disapointed with the low-fi recording. I realize the soundtrack is from the 1940's, but I assumed it has been re-mastered. Rather muddy sound."
1,What A Disappointment!,"I could not wait to get this CD and have my grandchildren listen to it for the Christmas Holidays. However, I was very disappointed. The sound was not good on some of the tracks."
2,Very poor audio quality mars production,"My family loves ""Fantasia,"" but the poor audio quality of this recording makes it nearly impossible to listen to. Disappointing."
1,Complaint,"I thought that I was ordering a DVD of the original movie, which I remember seeing when it first was screened. To receive only the sound track, without any animation, was annoying to say the least. Your description of the offered product could have been more explicit."
1,Unlistenable.,"Don't get me wrong, Fantasia is one of my favorite movies and Stokowski my favorite conductor--a true genius. The problem is that these CDs were ""restored"" (""destroyed"" would be a better word) by someone who has no idea what music sounds like. In a desperate attempt to preserve our ears from any (gasp!) noise, a brutal gating filter was used to destroy any semblance of the sound of real instruments. And, since optical recording of the time had very poor treble response, what treble there is has been boosted mercilessly, resuting in shrill, screechy strings. I really cannot bear to listen to these CDs.I see that someone has muddied the waters by uploading pictures of the 1980s digital re-recording of the soundtrack (the CDs with the brown background). Blasphemous as it sounds, that may be the better way to hear this music, at least until the Disney company sees fit to allow a proper restoration of the original soundtrack to be done."
1,"Mickey mouse on cover, elevator music for 70 year olds","I bought it a couple of years ago looking at the cover but was extremely disappointed when my 18-month old insisted on ""Mickey"" today and I chucked it into my DVD player. Our baby started crying aloud suggesting ""what is this rap?"" Disney folks ought to know better not try and market elevator music for 70-year olds to little toddlers regardless of how fantasia the cover looks like!"
3,Blue Topaz Earrings,I was not very happy with these earrings. I was expecting a little more but I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Not enough specifics,There is some good information but not enough specifics on how to combine the two steps together during the swing.
5,Big Up to Big Up,"A truely orginial ""scrap-book"" style photographic book....The energy driven pictures document the last decade of urban/youth culture....You will love this book if you're a fan of reportage photography."
2,2 3/4 stars,"I found out about this book in some magazine (I only read Source, Vibe, Underlined Magazine, Essence, and the magazine with Vivica Foxx and 50 Cent on the cover this month) and I had to go to the bookstore to grab it. Photos like people on the El, Vin Diesel, Crazy Legs, and newspaper outfits make me miss my childhood (minus Vin Diesel, although he's just great eye candy). A few photos seem plain or typical (ex. Treach's photos, the everfamous middle finger shot, and the soccer photos), some were enjoyable for no apparent reason (Spencer 97 Pro Skater, man on bike in South Bronx), and others were completely unique (Usher, Naomi 03 in Da Studio, Karlene & Cindy, ""Do Not""). Overall I enjoyed the book."
5,Don't miss out! Hot Body always delivers!!,Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and Totally Nude Teachers Contest is definitely one to grab.
4,Interesting enough,"I've always been a big fan of these series, but this book definately wasn't the best. It was good and touching, but it wasn't lyke THAT exciting. I liked it, but I liked the other books MUCH better. You might as well read it if your going to read any others, the author tends to refer back to other books. :/"
5,Love it!,"I just love this book, I really like Ty and Amy they are the best. I really like all the parts where they ARE ALL A LONE it is realy really good. and i don't think Lauren brooke should never stop WRITING THEM. LOVE YA!"
4,really good book,"i think this book is great...i couldnt put it down...lauren is such a good writer...she better not stop...and i think amy and ty are so good together...but i think they need to have more ""alone"" moments(...)"
3,Not The Best,HiThis is'nt the best book that i've read.I live in australia so i Know what it's like. I was Interesting to read what the Author thought and knew about australia. Lauren Brooke is a fab autor and really draws me in but this wouldn't be her best book.
3,Great phone with irritating feature,"We got this phone about 6 months ago and have liked it, in general. But, it has a very annoying feature: when you page the phone, it beeps at the base as well as at the remote phone making it impossible to actually HEAR the remote phone being paged. Poor design!"
1,Is this a joke???,"To say that Islam tolerates Homosexuality is a very humorous claim indeed. This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of ""Lot"" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this. MY ADVICE, BEFORE YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING SOMEONE SAYS OR WRITES ABOUT, do your own independant research to see if the author is honest or just a fanatic. In this cas go read what the Quran really says about homosexuals."
1,The Biggest Piece of Junk ever written!!,"Islamic Sexualities by Stephen O. Murray is probably the worst piece of Literature ever written.It is all fiction, it does not contain even one bit of truth. It was just written by a bunch of homosexuals who are attempting to justify homosexuality by ""claiming"" that the Middle East tolerates homosexuaity which is a bunch of trash considering the fact that homosexuality by Islamic Law and Middle Eastern Secular Law is punishable by DEATH! This book is a waste of money not to mention a waste of trees, and has no benefit. It is just a waste of time, even a ""fairy tale"" or for that mmatter a ""tall tale"" has more truth than this book."
1,Stale and inedible! Terrible nuts!,I bought these cashews thinking they were premium nuts and my wife and I both agreed they were old and stale and flavorless. If your smart stick with the standard Planter's cashews they have more flavor and are fresher.
1,very very frustrating,"Did not load at first had to return it. Then it freezes and you loose everything from that playing session, would highly recommend against this product.Also tech person was very rude."
2,Reel Deal Slots Bonus Mania,This games was not as exciting as I thought it would be when I purchased it. Only a couple of the games were exciting to play.
5,Phantom Bonus Mania,"I really enjoy the Phantom slot games. I have 6 of them, (Ghost Town, Bonus Mania, Mystic Forest, Treasures of the Far East, Blackbeards Revenge and Adventure. The only problem I have had is with The Bonus Mania game. The game ""Bar Tender"" bonus game does not work. It freezes up and I have to reboot my PC and the game. The rest of the games work as they should."
2,It blew up this evening,"I've had my RX-D202B for about a month now and, up to this point, it has worked very nicely. I came home this evening to watch a DVD on my new plasma TV with full digital surround-sound via this receiver/amp, but when I turned it on there was a bright blue flash from inside the right rear of the cabinet, and now it refuses to power on, even after I've tried everything I could think of to reset it. Its power is filtered through a surge protector, it hadn't been turned on all day prior to that, and I've verified (by meter and by hooking up my old surround-sound system) that the speakers and speaker wiring are not shorted, so I have no explanation for this behavior. I suspect a fuse has blown, but the cabinet is designed (and the warning labels sufficiently alarming) so that opening it up to look inside seems contraindicated. I'll know more after I take it in for warranty service, but I'm a bit skeptical of this thing right at the moment."
1,"Took a chance, got burned.","Bought this unit to replace an aging Kenwood 5.1 digital receiver. Had the unit for about two weeks, at about that time I was watching a movie late one night when out of the corner of my eye I caught a bright white flash and about as soon as that registered I realized that I no longer had any audio. The unit would still power on but no audio.I applied for a refund from Amazon, they accepted and had the unit picked up shortly thereafter at my house and at no cost to me. About a little over a week later I had my refund.Lessons learned, going to buy a more reputable unit this time around. But definitely no hesitation in dealing with Amazon again.While the unit was functioning it wasn't all that impressive, the audio was solid for its price range but the feature set was not overly useful when connecting to a HTPC with coax or fiber optics."
2,Too Cheap?,"JVC has a reputation for making reasonable quality products for a reasonable price. The receiver I got started having problems after about 2 weeks. It started putting out a feedback loop when a digtal source was inactive. But what made me return it was, it would shut off when playing loud DVD scenes. It would do this only on some output setting.It's reasonable that a 7.1 receiver at this price would not have some features like video conversion. I had come to expect that JVC products do what they do fairly well. At least the receiver I got didn't."
4,The Good Twin Rebels!,"This book is about Summer - she is the good, rational twin who does everything right and is right on track in her five year plan - she's engaged to be married & if she lands an interview with a well-known rock star, she'll earn the right to be a reporter for her family's magazine. Summer's twin Scarlet is the opposite of her - she's kind of wild and free and seems to go with the flow. Well....Summer lands her interview with the rock star, but she also lands in bed with him & loses her virginity while still engaged to her fiance! Needless to say, her life is veering way off the track of her five year plan, but she is surprised by how much she actually enjoys living in the moment.....this is a good book - enjoy!"
4,Good for Educators and Parents,"This book is intended for Educators and Parents interested in promoting moral development in children. It describes stages of moral development, based in Kholberg's theory and takes it to the school practice. Bachelor Degree level."
3,Studio Albums/CD's Are Better than Sweater,"I like Keith, however, he is not a ""live"" singer - his voice is not cut out for singing live on stage - not every singer can sing outside of the recording studio - some can and some cannot, unless you are Janet/Madonna/Paula/Brittney and you are dancing most of the time you are on stage, if you get my drift. But, if you are a hardcore Keith Sweat fan, then, you will want to add this to your collection."
4,SILK STEALS THE SHOW!!!,"It's common knowledge that Keith Sweat live in concert is strictly for the hardcore Keith Sweat fans only... HOWEVER... if for no other reason - this DVD is a must-have for the live performance of Silk. ""Freak Me"" is off the chain! It was great to see all 5 original members performing together again."
1,Title should be: Erotic Farce. One star is too many.,"This was a gay porn show without the porn. This was not a gay movie. With the key word being ""movie"". Thank you Amazon for my money back so I could buy a real ""gay movie""."
3,Hardcore disguised as soft,A hardcore movie with all fellatio scenes removed. Worth only to see the feature's main star naked!
1,what were they tbinking?,"really has no plot. it has a few lines between the actors and then right to the sex.it is a soft porn, they don't show really anything, but you are aware that they are doing it."
2,Not worth it.,"There are better anthologies available. This one contains many examples of Goldberg's work, and will introduce those not familiar with him to some of his best stuff. However, this paperback is small, unattractive and really not worth the money. Spend a little more and get something worthwhile."
5,Nice product,"I've taken both flax seed and evening primrose for several years now. The price for this product is great, and the product works exactly like the far-more expensive pills I took before. This is a high-quality supplement that I recommend."
5,Must have,This product has helped releaved hot flashes as well as joint pain! I would highly recommend to any one with similar symptoms.
2,Not a bad little exercise book,"This is a good little exercise book for anyone who is looking for a way to flex the writing muscles. There are, unfortunately, not as many examples of good writing as I would have liked."
2,Recommend Buying Something Else,"To be honest, I found this book disappointing in many ways. I recommend to those that view this comment, look for a different book on improving your writing abilities because this book doesn't help. I hope the viewers review the negative comments as well as the positive comments before making a purchase because the positive comments on this book are over exaggerated. Overall its not a complete useless book, as it does give some helpful tips, but many of the tips listed aren't really helpful. Chapter 1 basically says, build your vocabulary, get reference books, improve spelling, read, take a class, research, and the one I hate the most, ""Eavesdrop"". Its not until chapter 3 that i find this book the slight bit of help, which talks about writing a strong lead. I really recommend buying a different book, and make sure the book you buy actually states helpful ways on improving your writing, and doesn't state obvious ways such as this book."
4,Plentiful New Ideas in this Compact Volume,"I am always pleased to find new ideas to compliment my writing. I am a forever student, knowing I can always improve on my craft - this book delivers in some surprising ways.As I was reading along I thought to myself, ""What if a committed writer took each technique and spread it over one day at a time?"" I realized any writer would see a dramatic increase in writing effectiveness.I especially enjoyed the section on Making Yourself a LIKEABLE writer. I had never considered that before - although in some writers tone and style I don't like them at all. Its companion section ""12 Ways to Avoid Making Your Reader Hate You"" is equally excellent and includes such tips as avoid jargon, clichés, parenthesis - which Provost's distinction of parathesis ""annoying interruption"" will stick with me forever.Also included is a helpful and simple grammar/punctuation primer."
2,uninspiring,I did not like this book and did not enjoy reading it. I am serious about learning how to write better and I did not find this book helpful to me.
3,Read the Table of Contents only,"This is a good book for the starter writer. He will find good advice here, but he needs to be on a path of daily practice to fully understand what those advices mean.For intermediate level writers and up, the Table of Contents is enough. It reminds you of the tools of the trade, and then you can pass along and finally stick to what matters: be prepared to write, write, and think about your writing."
5,"Classic - Not just what he tells you, but how","I've kept my yellowed, dog-eared copy close at hand since I bought it in the eighties. Provost's writing is direct and uncluttered and he quotes authors such as Hemmingway, Bradbury and Fitzgerald as models of effectiveness. His own examples are often hilarious - which means they'll stay with you for years. The 100 Ways are grouped by category to avoid a feeling of randomness. Sure, the book is 20 years old and you won't find a lot of techie pop-culture references in it (though somehow I doubt the author, now sadly passed on, were he writing today, would have veered much from his chosen style.) Buy it, learn from it. Keep it close by.(Provost's later book ""Make Your Words Work"" expands on many of the same ideas and includes exercises. Unfortunately, it's out of print and tough to find.)"
4,"Small, short, simple, practical -What's not to like?","Disclaimer: If you have read scores of books on writing, have an M.B.A. or degree in journalism, or if you are a published, bestselling author, this book may not be for you. However, if you are just starting out or want a compact book full of practical advice on writing better-no matter what it is you write-this book can be pure gold. I like it. Personally, I've found myself thumbing through it from time to time just to remind myself of what it means to write well. To me, it's better than a lot of other writing books because it gets strait to the lesson, without much hulubaloo. Two of my favorite tips for improving my writing are, ""Vary your sentence structure"" and, ""Vary your sentence length."" Perhaps common sense to some, but to me it was eye-opening. Until I read those short stratiegies, my writing tended to be choppy instead of flowing; pedantic instead of poetic. In short, the book improved my writing. It can do the same for yours."
5,Infinitely Helpful,"A must-have for any aspiring new authors. The book will give you insights into what you may have been doing wrong--it includes an entire section dealing with grammar--and what you can do to improve your writing (e.g. arguing that readers will be more interested if the author uses the aggressive voice as opposed to the passive, but like a good teacher Provost also demonstrates a few exceptions that prove the rule).Provost approaches the work with a familiar style, allowing the reader to identify with him and spacing this book far apart from a detached textbook."
5,Wonderful,"A concise, all-inclusive guide to writing well. This book should be apart of every writers library. The topics are well laid out, the language is clear and easy to grasp, and the author does a great job of keeping things interesting. I highly recommend this book."
2,I read it in one subway ride,"One of the tips is actually ""touch your toes."" At other times, the author quotes from his own stories to show examples of ""good writing."" As another reviewer said, just read the table of contents. This book is dopey and outdated. Perhaps good for middle school-aged aspiring writers, but not really useful or inspiring for experienced/rusty writers."
1,Boring - I don't want writing advice from a someone who can't write.,"This book is boring. I used it for killing flies. Any book on writing should be amazing -- why would you want to learn from writing from someone who was not good?Other good books include: Secrets of the Written Word, and On Writing Well."
4,Concise and Succinct,The book delivered what it promised. I used it as a tool to review my document. I would recommend this one as a helper for perfecting one's writing.
3,It had a couple hiccups for me...,"I had a couple problems with the system. First the T didn't fit too well for me. I pushed and pushed, but couldn't get it on far enough to make use of the hose clamps. I pushed it on good enough though that I didn't need them. I will however probably try and lube it a little and try again before driving. The next problem I had was the radiator neck do-hickey didn't ""snap"" into the radiator. I just had to hold it down with my hand which lead to spillage. Thirdly it says to run the hose to it for 5 minutes. Thats kinda of a lot of water. I emptied a 5-gallon bucket about 5 times and still had some trace amounts of anti-freeze. Are you expected to have a 55-gallon drum to use this thing? All and all I got done what I needed though and will probably purchase another kit for my track car and hope the pieces fit better with that."
3,Overflow tube useless,"The overflow tube (shown in the upper left of the picture), which is supposed to be inserted into the fill neck of the radiator, doesn't fit newer (like less than 15 years) cars. Calling Prestone didn't help. They said ""let the old fluid spill out of the radiator"". Works well, other than that."
5,"""Poohish"" Fun for everyone!",This CD is great! Songs project a wonderful image of friendship mixed with Pooh fun! Songs are also compleaty clean (no bad words) and tell short stories as well! A must for everyone 4 - 100! I am 8 and I have loved this CD for as long as I can rember! Definatly a five-star!
3,Better Pooh CDs Out There,This CD is okay. Some of the songs are pretty boring. It didn't capture the attention of my little and his cousins for even half the CD. There are better Pooh CDs out there!
4,Awesome,I love this CD. My kids ask for it all the time so they can dance to it. I hear positive words of encouragement and ways to deal with everyday problems for little kids and adults alike. For a Pooh fan this is an especially neat CD to own.
5,Gift worth giving.,"Just as the description and other reviews said it was. Bought it for my brother as a gift a couple Christmas' ago and he loves it. It's a really good durable, light golf bag."
3,"Good seller, decent product, some flaws","The mask is nice, but I wouldn't buy it again. It's practically child-sized, and the mask ties on with an elastic string which is a little too short. It's fine for me since I'm just using it for photos; but as a previous poster mentioned, I'd be upset if I were trying to get any serious use out of it."
3,"Amusing, gets uncomfortable after about 30 minutes","I just wore this mask at work for a prank we pulled that took about an hour. It definitely has the intended effect of making you look absurd, but it puts a gentle pressure on your eyes the entire time. After a little while it starts to get annoying. The material doesn't breathe either, but that's normal. Just keep in mind if you want to wear this out all night that you'll be pulling it up and rubbing your face every 5-10 minutes after a half hour."
2,manufacturing problem,Love the show and the episodes I got but I only got 6 of the 12 episodes. The packaging has only 1 DVD and it is a double sided one but one side has 3 episodes and the other side has only 3 as well. Amazon responded quickly to the complaint and sent me another but it is the same. The packaging or manufacturing did something wrong.
4,Interesting but preachy,"We haven't really watched any other autopsy shows. This one is interesting, as some cases are tragic and others bizarre. I think Dr. G is fairly preachy, often commenting on how you should check your blood pressure, etc. so you don't end up dead for the same reason these people did."
3,"Great, but not what I had hoped for.","I bought this video because I thought that actual autopsies would be shown from when the show first started. I am disappointed it doesn't reveal what I had hoped, but I still like the show. I have learned a lot of things just from watching what is shown. I would just like to see some of the things she does. It seems somehow redundant to have a show about doing autopsies, but not show any of them."
3,Great Movie - But no English sub's for the German dialogue.,"This is my grandfathers favoritt movie of all time, and when his VHS tape stopped working a few years ago we aimed to source out a DVD version!Now we found it hurray :) the DVD works perfectly the movies is great but the subtitles are very poor!The entire movie is subtitled in korean (both german and english), thats great for koreans.But they only subtitled the English speaking characters in english, so when the german characters start speaking there is no english subtitles so we have no idea what they are talking about.Its a sore dissapointment as the german dialogue is just as important as the english dialogue. Why on earth subtitle the English language with english subtitles? And leave the german un-subtitled?Dissapointed, but it is a great movie!"
4,VHS Recording - Operation daybreak,"A hard to find title. However Amazon were up to the challenge. The item was fairly priced, professionally packaged, quite undamaged, and delivery was timely and without complication.Many thanks"
5,A bit of history,The video was very well done and based on a true story. Actors were the right people for the job.
4,A good representation of an important event in WW II,An accurate portrayal of the assassination of Adolf Hitler's deputy.Reprisals for the assassination are shocking in their magnitude and brutalityGripping last scene in the basement.The film is accompanied by excerpts from Schubert's Serenade which is an appropriate match for mood of the film.
3,Quality of the Product,"This DVD needs improvement in its soundtrack which is too faint in some parts of the DVD while adequate in other parts of the DVD. While there are Korean subtitles for the entire DVD, the German speaking scenes of the DVD are not translated into English and there are no English subtitles for these German speaking scenes either. Can this situation be remedied for future copies of this movie?Operation Daybreak (Import NTSC All Regions)"
3,Operation Daybreak,"This is a good movie but the big problem with this dvd was it had no subtitles when the Germans were talking. I feel that I missed a lot because of it. I liked the fact that it was a true story, very interesting."
3,"Yes, I still LOVE Donna! BUT...","I have to agree with the other reviews I have read...there's no point in buying this CD - if you are a fan like me...you already have all of this material AND MORE. Her last CD of original material ""Crayons,"" was excellent in every way and completely up to the standards we've all come to expect from this extraordinary pop sensation! So, I'll just wait around for something new again...and hope that it comes along soon because like CHER, Donna most definitely deserves that last ""over the top"" pop/dance hit song and TOUR...She deserves it and WE deserve it...so Donna, YOU GO GIRL!!!!!"
1,No More Retreads!,"One of the most underrated artists to come out of the disco era has been unfairly dealt another career set-back with yet another ""Best of"" collection. Summer's two decade career has been full of ""Best of"" collections - from ON THE RADIO, WALK AWAY, SUMMER ANTHOLOGY, ENDLESS SUMMER, BEST OF - why won't the record companies have more faith in her new work rather than timidly test the waters with these tired collections?"
3,Greatest Hits..Sure..Yeah Right,"What a waste of time this one is. The only reason to buy it is the cover where Donna looks brilliant. A lot of hits are here (""Last Dance"", ""Bad Girls"", ""I Feel Love"", etc.) but also many are missing (""Heaven Knows"", Dim All The Lights"", ""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough"", etc.). And once again ""State Of Independence"" lurks its head up in a place that an eighties track like the sweet ""There Goes My Baby"" or even the fun ""Dinner With Gershwin"" should be placed. The hits are also edits and nothing special. Spend a few more bucks and get the much better ""Endless Summer"" that comes with two new tracks. This looks like a bad rehash of that. And if you save up a few bucks, get ""Donna Summer Anthology""."
3,I Don't Understand Why This Was Made?,"Like other reviewers, this is NOT a great hit colllection. Here's why: I will highlight her previous hit collections.Buy:1. On The Radio - Greatest Hits 1&2 -- If you only like her 70's music.2. The Anthology Collection - If you want to dig deeper beyond a hits collection with 2 CDs.3. Endless Summer - If you want THE major highlights spanning her entire collection up to 1994 including 80s tracks that obviously you won't have on On The Radio.You can buy any of these 3 and not be disappointed. Anything else after that is UNNECESSARY unless you have money to splurge or Donna gets back on Top 40 radio (which I always hope for:)) Donna is certainly capable of a few more hits even though she is 54 years old."
3,disappointed,I was really disappointed with this CD because of Donna Summers greatest songs were blatantly left out of this CD!
1,Doesn't stay put,"Maybe someone else has a solution to this before I return it:Every time I use it, the slightest pressure (ie using my chinrest) causes it to bow out and detach from the viola. It also likes to twist out of configuration almost immediately. I'm really wishing I'd bought another fixed Kung rest. Suggestions on how to make this one work before I send it back?Thanks,"
5,Especially for lovers of the film,"To start with let me say I love the original movie and I'm doubt the up coming remake will do it justice, unlike this game. It is simply great fun. Games like GTA although technically better, lack the humor that makes this fun to play. That said the graphics are more than acceptable and the controls are both simple and responsive. The Mini's behave just like my old one did, and for the price it is hard to beat. I would recomend getting hold of the original movie first or else some of the jokes will be lost on you, especially characters like Camp Freddie and Peaches."
5,Stunning!,"This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price! :-) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I ""won"". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring."
2,Scratched up in 5 days,"While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom)."
3,Get Remastered version instead,"This is Colosseum's first album. Like many first albums, it has a grouping of very good songs. They are a little rough and unfocused. But, most are fun and entertaining.I give this version 3 stars, because there is a remastered version now available. However if you already own this one, I would not recommend going out and buying the remastered version.Colosseum's second album was Valentyne Suite, which was released in Europe. In the US, the second album was released as The Grass Is Greener and has some different tracks. It was common during these times to have different versions on an album in the US and in the UK, especially for ""progressive"" type music."
4,"Direct, well stated and relevant for today","In a world where people don't keep their committments at any level, this book should be a must read for any couple about to enter marriage as well as those, like myself, who have been married for over 15 years. You don't have to be a Christian to get a lot out of this book either, though Christians should certainly relate. He does a terrific job of explaining the stages of a marriage, how to overcome selfishness and I recommend it."
1,liberty heights,"learned the hard way! if I had scrolled down far enough, I would have read that this is not the songs in the movie which were great! this is the score and holds no magic for me whatsoever, I wanted the great blues and jazz in the movie. glad I did not pay an arm and a leg for this. another item for a yard sale."
5,"FWIW, I think this is the BEST Small Faces comp out there","And yes, that includes Darlings...Firstly, lemme address the ""remastering"" issue. Darlings and the recent Castle reissues might claim to be ""Remastered,"" but to my ears this collection sounds much better; less trebly, more naturally balanced. Additionally, this is so much more of a better track selection (you get the nice, real stereo Wham Bam instead of the horrifically phased version on Wharf). Give this one a shot."
1,Bad...and I do mean BAD,"First of all let me tell you that I really like Diana Palmer which is why I am having such a hard time understanding what on earth she thinking of when she wrote this story. The story ""Night of Love"" never got a chance to develop because she already had them declaring their love for each other soon after the book started. I know it was a short story but come on...give me something to look forward to.The second story, written by Joan Elliot Pickart, was so poorly written it might as well have been something my 10 year old sister put together. The entire story was boring and sloppy. However, it was even worse when I realized that the hero sounded a lot like a woman, he was completely unbelievable and ultra feminine. There was so much a$$ kissing in the story that I simply could not finish it. Out of all the books that I have ever read (and I have read many) this was by far the worst."
2,NO RESUME!!!,"The title says it all. If you bought this player for listening to audiobooks, which is what I did, you'll be extremely disappointed that you'll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature. Considering audiobooks are anywhere from 3 to 8 hours long in most cases, or at least the pieces you get from audible are, it's totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on. Get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you're going to be doing a lot of it. Lame."
1,A piece of junk,"I was very happy with this item when I first purchased it except for the battery compartment. The screw has never held it shut and it would come off continuously if the belt clip did not hold it on. Now, 2 months later it will only play the one song that came preloaded or 1 preset station. I cannot get it to display any of the other screen options so am unable to access the audio book loaded on it, add more music or listen to any other radio station. I would not recommend this item to anyone. The manual suggests if you have a programming problem to remove the battery and start over. This seems to suggest they expect you to have problems. My battery has been disconnected MANY times and this now no longer solves the problem."
2,terrible,"electrical short kills cheap-med quality head phones! i lost four before i figure out the problem. and no, it was not just one player. i returned it and got a new one, and it did the same thing. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 because it records radio very well.DO NOT BUY!"
3,Over time....,"The first three months I had this player it was great. It did everything I needed it to do...play music while I ran for anywhere between 30-45 minutes. However, now that I've had it about 6 months things are starting to go wrong. The shuffle doesn't shuffle nor does the repeat repeat. The button to move forward through tracks also refuses to work. Its a nice little player for the money and for the first 3-5 months you have it...but beware of its functionality over time."
5,Stop Searching... Just Buy It Already!,I am blown away with everything about this unit:1) Super small Size2) Water resistant3) Great Sound4) Easy file transfer5) 256Meg is way more than enough space than I'll ever use.
4,alsome,it is really cool and its easy to use the only problem is the middle controle thing its hard to get used to
3,Paul Desmond - early life,"Quite a book for Paul Desmond fans. It's a shame that it does not chronicle ""a day in the life"" of Paul Desmond as the famous jazz sax player in his last years. I still want to know his personality in rehearsals, travels and performances around the world."
2,"Works OK, runs VERY hot","I've had this unit for approximately 1 year.The good part is that the audio and video through this receiver work well: HDTV picture looks great and the surround sounds great. I only use the HDMI inputs and outputs, but they work fine.I have another issue with the unit: it runs hot. I have a dedicated fan behind the unit that blows air underneath it. As long as the fan is on, the unit is quite warm. If the fan is off, the unit gets hot - hot enough that it's uncomfortable to touch.I'm concerned enough about the safety of this unit (wood, power cables, and heat don't mix well), that I'm going to replace it - despite it being one year old, and working fine."
2,Headache,"I got this receiver as a Christmas gift Dec. 07. It is in the service shop after a week of service due to overwhelming smell coming from receiver when turned on. I described the smell to JVC customer service as ""acrid, smokey, toxic, headache causing smell"". The unit is operational, but just not possible to be in the same room with it when its on."
5,"Complete, coherent political-economic analysis of Lat. Am.","Robert Gwynne and Cristobal Kay have put together an impressive and timely analysis of current trends in Latin American Development. The coverage of the countries of the region is excellent, as is that of their economic, political, and social trends...The range of issues raised and the quality of their documentation make this an excellent text for teaching and for research. Prof. Bryan Roberts, University of Texas at Austin"
3,"fun, but snake head burst","Fun sprinkler, good length, but snake head burst at the seam about 30 minutes into play. Water pressure wasn't even on high. To save it and still use it we tied it's head into a knot and it works. Again fun, cute idea, but not durable."
3,Snake head pops,"My girls (5 & 2 1/2) love this sprinkler. The water doesn't seem to spray as high as the photo but will if you apply pressure (i.e. they stand) on parts of the snake body. Similar to the other review, within 30 min, the snake head burst at the seam. Duct tape didn't seem to work, but I'll try to ""tie the head"" and see if that works as well. But, great concept and again, especially small kids love it."
2,Poor quality,"My daughter saw this in a magazine and really wanted it. It takes about 5 minutes to fill as the 20 foot body has to fill completely before water starts coming out. The height of the water sprinklers 100% depends on your water pressure. Ours in the backyard is not that good so it only shot out maybe 2 - 2.5 feet high. My kids used it for about 30 minutes when my little one went and touched the face. She grabbed it and the mouth ripped all the way open. The company I ordered from shipped a new one immediately, which was great, but it is not a durable product. My kids can run near it but they are not allowed it touch it at all. I will not be ordering another sprinkler from whoever made this one. If you order the snake sprinkler make sure your kids don't touch it, step on it, that there are no sticks, no sharp weeds, etc."
3,Great fun that was short lived!,We really enjoyed playing with this toy for a few days but then the seam along the tail ripped. I tied off the section that was messed up and we played with it some more but it didn't work as well. It also did not seem to have very good pressure and worked best on a hill so gravity pulled the water into the head and the water sprayed higher. Kids had fun with it while it lasted but I wouldn't recommend buying this.
1,Wigglin Water Snake,Please do not waste ur money on this sprinkler. It busted during our 3rd time of using it. It didn't shoot water out far at all and the kids did not enjoy it! It was a total waste of money and I am now having too find another sprinkler for my kids! I am completely unsatisfied with this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Keeps the Headaches Away,"This herb is well worth a try for anyone who suffers from frequent headaches that last several days and so not respond well to pain relievers. Like any herbal remedy, it takes a few weeks to build up to an effective level. Only one capsule a day is needed. I've taken this for quite a few years, and I no longer suffer from three-day headaches--quite a relief. Definitely tell your physician if you are taking this (or any other herb/vitamin), as there are always possibilities of interactions with prescribed drugs. Also, this is one they want patients to stay away from for a few days before surgical procedures."
3,Betrayed by Disney,"OK, first I should say that this CD does have music from the sound track of /Mary Poppins/ and may be exactly what you are looking for.However, it is not a CD version of the original LP soundtrack album. The most noticeable difference is in track 13, where the equation of the fate of ""the Banks of England"" to that of England herself is missing. This is at 3:00 into the track: here, you get two seconds of music and the senseless remark ""You see, children?""; on the LP, you got several seconds of Dick van Dyke as the Elder Mr Dawes and the question made sense.So far as I can tell, Disney never put out a CD of the original LP. Which is a great pity, although, again, I should say that this will certainly do if you either have no idea what I am talking about or don't think it is that important."
5,Motivator,This book is a motivator. Richard talks from experience on how to sale yourself and make it big. Truly inspiring for anyone trying to make into Sales or Hollywood. Richard shows the pitfalls and achievements he has made. I highly recommend this book!
2,Where's Mrs Potts?,"An adequate CD, but one may as well buy any ordinary christmas album, nothing here is special to beauty and the besat. Beauty and the Beast without Angela Lansbury is a disturbing thought, a real disappointment that she isn't on there. If she was, the rating would no doubt have risen to 5 stars.Fancy putting talent a Broadway star in a musical and not writing her a number or two! Crazy!"
2,pure garbage,If you have ever had a surround receiver you will find this one disappointing. The surface temp of the receiver runs in excess of 120 degress. Weak sound to back speakers. Insane setup features. The owners manual gave me a headache. The decoder does a poor job of seperation!
1,Poorly designed product - heats up like an oven,"I bought this receiver last year to work with a new LCD TV, and placed it in a walk-in closet in my bedroom behind the wall the TV was installed on. The closet has good ventilation, and has the cable DVR and separate DVD player on a small rack, without any problems, both running without much heat at all. After installing this item on the rack, the temp in the closet went up significantly, and I could smell an electrical/hot plastic aroma. My wife and daughter immediately noticed it too. The surface of the receiver was incredibly hot, with any use of the device pushing it up even further. Not good. Based on that, the item was packed up and returned. I've never had an electronic device generate that much heat. Scary.Heartland was the vendor that fulfilled the order via Amazon. They were great, handled the return without any issues. Good vendor. Bad product."
1,Crash Time,This Game continually crashes on my PC. I'm not sure what the problem is. It might be that I just started using XP on my new dell PC.
4,Somewhere between furniture and garage style,"I keep my tools in my home office/workshop, and it looks more like a piece of furniture than an ugly toolchest. It's not so fine that you'll worry about abusing it (it is a toolchest, after all), but it's well made and capable of holding over 400lbs of tools. Only complaint is that the smaller drawers are perhaps slightly too small for some items."
5,Quality materials and construction,"I know this was made in China but the materials and construction was very good. One of the bottom panels of one drawer had been pushed loose causing the drawer below it to drag. Easy Fix!!! Works great now. For the money, it can't be beat."
2,Desilusionado,"Me da pena decir que Leo Dan cometio un gran error en grabar esas melodias fantasticas en una version ""REMIX"" con musica que no concuerda con las letras de estas presiosas canciones sentimentales."
1,No tiene la orquestración original,"Yo solamente he escuchado a unos discos nuevos de Leo Dan que son colecciones de sus mejores canciones. Aún, yo se que estas canciones no son los originales. Tiene versiones diferentes, con ritmos electronicos y sonidos extraños. No tiene las violinas y tambores ricos. Suena más como una fiesta de jovenos jugando con sus computadores que la musica del idolo."
2,"Fun, could be better.","I really think that this game is a really fun game, and having it portable on the PSP is awesome. The thing I didn't like about it though is that I felt like I was always waiting for it to load. Even when I was in the middle of game play, the game would slow down for it to load. I felt like EA must not have tested this game much, or else they would have discovered that obvious bug."
5,muscadine medicine,"This book has a lot of valuable information about muscadine grapes that doesn't seem to be available anywhere else. The wine from muscadines has more resveratrol than any other wine, including pinot noir, which was what I thought had the most. It also is very high in polyphenols and other beneficial and natural compounds. The book does promote supplements made from muscadines, and I'm not sure they have the same benefits, having been dried or processed in some way. Even so, I'm glad I bought the book."
3,"Entertaining, easy to read","I thought this book was an eay to read novel and kind-a fun. It was one of those simple books that really seem to relate to a younger reader, but when you get in the Halloween spirit and you have some free time on your hands, I recommend this book. It is fun and easy and even spooky on a part or two! Based a lot on the Headless Horseman character, I enjoyed the read."
4,A Halloween read,"I read this book once as a teenager, but forgot the name. I've been looking for the book with the ""creepy cover"" for over 12 or so years now. I had given up on ever finding it again. I found it, purely by accident, when my husband recommended I read The End World Series written by the very same author. What luck!Anyway, here's my review: It wasn't really that bad. Too bad the plot is a complete rip-off of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving. The name of the town is even called ""Spook Hollow"" and the name of the evil that stalks Halloween is dubbed Headless Horror of Spook Hollow.Well, if you can put the rip-off and predictability aside, it was a pretty entertaining, and even chilling read.I plan on reading his other books. :"
3,883D is terrific!,"Similar sound to their other CDs, fun and catchy. The part I liked best about this CD was the CD-ROM track inside. In addition to pics from tours and chats with Max, there is software and passwords to download to get you into an interactive environment called '883D.' Meet 883 fans from around the word and interact with them virtually in real time. Very fun."
5,High Quality Tunes,"Catchy tunes, you find yourself wanting to sing along. Ah, if only my Italian was better, I can only hum to most songs. If you know some Italian and can translate the songs, you'll find Grazie Mille (title song) to be incredibly uplifting. Nearly every song on this album gets stuck in your head. If I could wear out a CD, this one would be gone already. Best songs, IMHO, are Grazie Mille (thanks a million), Almena Una Volta (At least once), Tutto Cio Che Ho (everything I have). I do recommend finding 883 fan sites on the Web and reviewing translations of songs as it will add to the experience."
3,"fun, but not the best that Italy has to offer","I bought this city while in Italy, since I had heard their name before (without actually knowing any of their music). After listening I had mixed feelings. It is definitely not a bad CD, and I especially liked Viaggio Al Centro Del Mondo, without realising it was the single taken from it. The music is a bit of a mix between dance and rock, but it sometimes sounds too synthetic for my taste. For better poppy indie try Luna Pop, for excellent Italian dance try Subsonica!"
4,"Good CD, but remix could have been included","I was in Italy this past summer and ""La Regina del Celebrita"" automatically caught my attention. After hearing it on the radio, I was hooked. A warning, though. The version I heard was the remix done by Eiffel 65. The version on the CD sounds a lot different. It sort of has an eighties feel to it, but that is just my opinion. I personally like the remix better. The CD is good, though--especially if you are new to the Italian music scene and want to start out your collection. Other recommendations: Luna Pop (for, obviously, pop songs) and Gigi D'Agostino ""L'amour Toujours"" for dance/club/techno music. The best song on that one is the title track."
5,What An Afternoon!,"The previous reviewer complained about the sound quality of this CD. What the hell do you expect on a ""live"" recording? ""Birdland"" was a jazz club, not a recording studio!This is a great CD, & the fact it was recorded live doesn't detract from the uniqueness of these two great trombonists. The harmonic structure is fabulous, & the interplay between them (point-counterpoint) is astounding.My favorite tune is the first offering, called ""Funnybone"" It was written by Kai. He wrote & arranged many of the tunes they became famous for. He also was one of the most underrated instrumentalists in the jazz world. J.J. went on to great fame, not undeserved.Don't let the previous reviewer discourage you from getting this CD. I guarantee you'll be looking for more ""Jay and Kay"" after you hear it.Notwithstanding the ignorance of the previous reviewer, get some of their studio recordings too."
3,Introduction to Computers,"A very basic book. For those that know nothing (I mean nothing) about computers it's an excellent buy. I bought it as it was required for a college course. Overall it's good information, but the information is just short of being common knowledge in today's age. It should be geared as a middle school book."
2,Mediocre,"It's not the worst textbook I've ever had but it's not great. Buy it if you have to for class otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Painful Read,"Painful, boring, and essentially worthless textbook. It describes simple terms so badly that definitions blend together and add serious confusion when examining critically. Those experienced with the topic could barely sort out this jumbled mess, and beginners will simply be lost."
1,If I could give less than 1 star - I would...I can't believe a University Actually picked this as a Text Book...,Worst text book I have ever bought. Downright PAINFUL to read. It was so bad I had to also buy the eBook just so I could search for the gibberish inside more effectively without compromising my grade. Nice...
3,I'd prefer buying it at a store to buying at amazon,"The watch as it is a very attractive piece. I love the dial in particular. Although picture in the product page doesn't give the exact measure of glossiness, I felt watch was little more glossier than I expected it to be.The reason I have given 3 stars is because of bad product delivery by amazon, this watch's chain is way too big for my wrist and the instructions provided in the manual is insufficient to modify the chain size. I bought this watch nearly 3 weeks ago and it is still in my rack, unused. Either amazon must have asked for my wrist size before delivery or should have guided me with the means to get the chain resized. Apparently I haven't had time to call them and find out coz I'm too busy.."
2,Quick Chew,First the good news: the dogs really liked these. Now the bad news: they are really more of a treat than a chew bone. My guys ate about a quarter of the souper size in less than 5 minutes. I had to take them away before they ate the whole thing in one try. I was hoping for something that would keep them occupied for awhile but this is not it.
1,lasted under a minute,This is not worth it. My pit ate it in large chunks in under a minute. i bought it locally for what i'd pay for dinner- not worth it in terms of money or time in keeping him busy. he takes longer to eat an entire bowl of food..
3,Wolf Size??,"My dogs seems to love the flavor of the bones but they don't look to be much bigger than just the regular ""Large"" bones you buy in the store. After Buddy (my dog) brings this one out of his hiding place (he hides all the bones that are easily edible), I'm sure he will devour it immediately."
3,Disappointing,"My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing. I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide. The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes. The description calls these ""edible chews,"" so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied. I wouldn't call these bones ""chewy"" either. They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry. I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember. I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though)."
2,Expensive treats!,"First let me say that all three of my dogs love these. They are not very aggressive chewers, but these only lasted a matter of minutes with each one of them. For this price, I expected a toy/treat that would last much longer. Save your money and buy a box of milk bones."
1,"Ordered twice, moldy both times!","When my first set of bones arrived covered in thick, hairy, green mold, I just sent them back and asked for a replacement. I thought that it might just be a one time thing. But my replacment set of bones came covered with the same type of mold. I am very disappointed! Amazon rarely disappoints me, but it has this time. I will just have to look for these at my local pet store."
4,good for variety,"My dog loves these. A little pricey, but can be broken into 2 or 3 smaller treats. My boxer boy has a sensitive stomach, and these have never given him any ""digestive"" (read ""gas"" or ""the runs"") problems, although I limit him to just a third of a bone a day. May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier. Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!"
1,Read the fine print,"We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this ""edible"" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically ""edible"", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.My advice, steer clear of these ""healthy"" edible Nylabones."
2,Shoulda Listened,"I agree with the previous reviewers - I should have listened! My Boston Terrier chewed up and ate an entire bone in less than 5 minutes. This may be a good ""treat"" but I would not call it a chew toy!"
3,Quick and apparently yummy toy,"If it lasted, it would be a good chew. It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel. Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes. He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now. No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones. No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler. I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble."
4,great!,"great product. my lab loves it. but she goes through it in 15 minutes. thats what scares me!!! she breaks it up into bits and I am always scared that she will choke on one. otherwise, dogs love these."
4,"Poignant, but Partially Pretentious","This is one of the more peculiar Everest movies I've purchased.It is narrated by the skier, but translated by a 3rd person. At times he, the skier, comes across as a bit pretentious. They'll show a stretch of the expedition .. then the narrator comes on and says something that is too obviously poetic or intentionally ""thought-provoking.""Overall, I find it to be a good feature on reaching your personal best but I would have preferred a more direct narration at times."
3,Small but nice memory book.,I ordered this product for a friend. It is a very nice looking book but too small to hold enough for a baby's first year.
1,waste of money,"I put this in my Baby registry looking at the picture. Its not worth for the money. It has hardly few pages and looks very cheap. Does not even have basic stuff like when baby was born, what was the price of milk etc,"
5,HOW DIFFERENT FROM CASIO MQ247B2?,"This watch resembles closely two other models sold for a few dollars cheaper, one being the great Casio - MQ247B2 and the other the CASIO CLASSIC WATER RESISTANT. There may be an upgrade of materials, but the image is indistinguishable and the features appear the same, although better specified on the Water Resistant page.Check shipping and availability to your addressBut definitely the watch to buy, once you replace the strap with clothAny other information you want at hand get off a calendar or a newspaper!"
3,Landscape Architect's Opinion,"Helpful book, providing specific information on species and plant communities, with an emphasis on native species. About 1/2 have b&w photos, not great by current standards. It was written and published when little else was available for species information, and though there is plenty of information online now, this book is still OK as one resource when choosing plant species for landscape design and restoration in Saudi Arabia. The most unique and helpful part is the info on S.A. plant communities. Since this book, another author Geoff Ricks wrote Landscape Plant Manual for Saudi Arabia, which has more information and color photos, and in general is more useful (but it's VERY hard to get a look at a copy except through universities). I gave it 3 stars in general, but give it 5 stars for being a unique resource. (reviewed by Landscape Architect)"
5,Pastry board,"I was thrilled to find this pastry board. We always used one growing up and once ""seasoned"" it's perfect for those delicate pie crusts and traditional Christmas cookies.I looked at several online and chose this one - made in America from select hardwoods - and couldn't be more pleased with the product"
4,"""D"" Funkman","hey...if you are a true Cameo fan, which I am, then this was one that you need to have...every song on this cd was the one that ""brought back them good memories"" and when you use to hear them come on at parties or on the radio, you would turn it up...but hearing them ""live"" was the ultimate...with me being a drummer, you know i always loved those funky drums and syncopated rythms...booya....one of the funkest introduction beats i have heard gots to be the opening drum tracks on She's Strange, ""nasty to the Bone""...and that straight driving beat on ""shake your pants""...like i said, i crave funk like that and these cats today can't even come up with nothing close...all they want to do is remix the funk with some tired ass rap lines over the top...i say, get your own funk and leave Cameo's funk alone....cause you just ain't gonna get it!"
3,Absorbente,"Una de esas novelas que te transportan, que te absorben en un mundo diferente. Ese es el mayor merito de la novela. Los personajes son mas bien planos, la prosa es pulida pero forzada, el mundo ""interior"" del protagonista no es muy profundo, ni interesante, ni sus observaciones agudas u originales. Pero, de alguna manera, el escritor ha logrado crear una atmosfera, un ambiente, un mundo, donde el lector quiere caminar y buscar otros personajes, otros seres, de los creados por el autor. El Viaje Interior es como una pelicula mediana en historia y personajes, pero de impecable cinematografia y genial soundtrack, lo suficiente para recordarla."
3,The ATX harness is too short!,"This supply might be fine if you have a compact HTPC case but if you are using a minitower PC case which accepts a microATX supply the motherboard power connector harness is only 7"" long and is likely to be too short! You may need an ATX extension cable in addition to this supply.I recommend this microATX supply instead (the cables are 16"" long):[...] 255W MICRO ATX COMPUTER ( MICATXPOW255 )"
2,Poor quality and appearance.,"Bought this to display at the front of the house, alternating between other flags of the same size and cost. All the other flags were sewn and of heavy nylon. Deep and rich colors. This flag was a thin, single piece of nylon and screen printed in the colors. It's already faded significantly after six months of periodic use. I would NOT buy this flag again from this vendor..."
1,"""How Dare You"" Polygram!","What a disappointment! Don't get me wrong, the tunes on this CD are good, but it's just a rehash of past ""Best Of"" compilations. 10cc have released SO MANY classic 45 RPM B-sides in their career that have never been available on an album, but do we get any of them here from Polygram?? NO! What 10cc fans need is a good ""Complete B-Sides"" compilation. Songs like ""Good News"", ""Channel Swimmer"", ""I'm So Laid Back I'm Laid Out"", ""Waterfall"", ""4% Of Something"", their 1976 backing track for a Revlon TV commercial, and a good dozen others. These are all classic 10cc tunes... virtually unheard by the public, and for that matter, most of their fans! What a shame. If you want the best of 10cc, get the ""1st LP/Sheet Music"" 2-On-1 CD, ""Original Soundtrack"", and ""How Dare You"". And while you're at it Polygram, when will you issue the excellent Godley & Creme ""Consequences"" album on CD?? Sheesh!!"
2,Why Bother?,"In June 1997 ""The Very Best of 10cc"" is released, covering 15 songs from their early UK hits ""Donna"" and ""Rubber Bullets"" to Godley and Creme's last hit ""Cry,"" featured on ""Miami Vice."" Between this CD and ""The Very Best of"" there is only one song not included in the latter CD, and this CD has a live version of ""Wall Street Shuffle."" The question is, considering that there is little difference in the price of the two CDs, why was this CD ever released?The music here is all good, and my rating does not reflect the selections, but rather the need to even have this CD in the first place. Pass this by and get the more comprehensive collection. You will find you enjoy the bigger collection more."
4,stoner ear candy,"The best compilation out now and cheap. If you lucky to find this then buy this instead of the very best of 10cc which is available here in the states. But there are a few tracks that could of been added like ""Silly Love"", ""Rubber Bullets"". But what this does offer is 10cc's later years which is not availble here in the states. But a box set is due out July 2002. So no luck finding this that will have everything you need."
5,Excellent,"All three of these musicians have mellowed over the years. They've proven their chops are pretty much unsurpassed in the industry already, but here they showcase their compositional skills and prove that they can play with passion.My favorites are Indigo, Chilean Pipe Song, and Topanga but every song here is at least good."
5,Extraordinary blend of talent and sound.,"Extraordinary! The sound, rhythm, acoustics, come together to make a wonderfully exotic sound which has been the hall mark of these gifted musicians. Upbeat and seductive this CD will delight any Clarke, DiMeola, or Ponty fan. My favorite is cut 1 Indigo."
3,Lacking Inspiration,"Here are three musicians known primarily for playing amplified instruments in fusion bands, but on The Rite of Strings they stick to acoustic instruments. Unfortunately, all three seem to be playing acoustic instruments with pickups that are wired right into the mixer, so this is not an acoustic album in the sense of making you feel as they are playing in a room, but at least we get to hear Stanley Clarke on the standup bass, which is always a treat, and Ponty is in excellent form on violin. Although the music itself seems to lack inspiration, at least to these ears, it is never less than entertaining, and the playing is smooth and clean, as is the sound."
3,MIDI *DOES* ruin it!,"Three very talented musicians. Why does Al insist on running his guitar through a whistle box? The tibre is totally destroyed by this, and it's done on several tunes. I wish I had the master tapes so I could edit it out. What a shame."
5,Christmas gift,Top quality product. I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she is very pleased. Ordering was easy with no hassles and the product arrived before it was expected during the Christmas rush. I would definitely order from here again.
1,Can you PLEASE send me a bike undamaged???,I've ordered this bike twice and both times it came with damaged and cracked parts. Don't bother wasting your time putting this bike together until you've inspected all the parts. Very frustrated.
1,Terrible product,"I agree with the other reviews on this product. The bike is too heavy for a child to ride easily, and in our case was also damaged in shipping. We had the same damage experienced by other reviewers: bent front fork."
1,bicycle arrived damaged,"I ordered this Schwinn Scorcher Bike for my 4 year old child -- Santa was bringing him a bike for Christmas! It arrived in the box, when I finally got around to putting it together (Christmas Eve afternoon) I realized after a while that the front wheel wouldn't ever fit into the front forks -- they were bent, either in the factory in China, or on the ship to the US, or in the UPS truck to where I live. What to do? I went out and found another bike, in a store that stayed open after hours just for me -- a 'near disaster' averted. The GOOD news is that I packed up the damaged bike, returned it to Amazon (post paid) and got a refund. End of story. (Never had a problem buying books from Amazon, will think twice about other 'goods' -- but very good returns policy.)"
1,Destroyed in Shipping,"The box was delivered split open. Either the bike is too heavy and was packaged poorly or it was mishandled by UPS.I have had two bikes shipped (the other wasn't through Amazon) and both were chipped/scratched & missing parts upon arrival.Buy from your local Target store.One note, the brake levers are just a little to hard to engage for a small child's hands."
3,Sherman Tank,This bike was a birthday present for my 4 year old son. Overall the bike is a good value. But the one thing that is hard not to overlook is the bike's weight. This bike is very heavy.
1,horrible,Bought this bike for my son. Assembly instructions are buried in the owners manual which appears generic to all Schwinn bikes. How about one page instructions that pertain only to this bike? I didn't buy a mountain bike so I really don't care to know how to assemble one. Upon attempting to assemble the bike I also found that the front fork was bent inward so much that the front wheel could not be placed in it. Bike will be returned.
1,Merr X-mas from Schwinn,"We opened the box just in time to get this assembled for our 4 year old son.Not very happy to see that the SEAT is missing, plus, no assembly instructions.Too late to get this product negative stars.Read the reviews, seems they were right this time."
3,disappointed,I specifically bought and paid more for the yellow and black bicycle. However the bicycle I received was orange. The orange bicycle selling for over $10 less than the yellow one at the time of purchase. As it was for Christmas there was no time for returns. My son loves his new bike however.
5,"Great bike, great delivery time, great experience",Very high quality product. My rough and tumble son has taken a few spills on it already and it is holding up outstanding. I Highly recommend it!!
5,Good bike for a new BIG BOY bike!!,"My son got this bike for his 4th birthday on March 14th, 2007. I chose this type due to liking Schwinn bikes for a long time...always had this type of bike for myself and my older children. Also, it may be a little large for a 4 year old, but I would like him to have it for some time, not just grow past it! Which is why I also liked that it came with training wheels!! Good sturdy bike that I think my son wil enjoy for a long time to come."
3,So/so,"Bike is nice and sturdy, but we paid $50 to get it assembled. Also it is EXTREMELY heavy for our 5 year old son. He likes the way it looks but because of the weight, he seems to have a harder time stopping (braking)."
3,Solid bike,"My 4 year old son loves his new bike, but like other people have said, it is unbelievably heavy. It weighs more than my son and is hard for me to lift into our Jeep to take it places. I'm a little worried that once we take the training wheels off and he starts falling more, the weight of the bike falling on him is going to be a problem. That said, it is a really sturdy bike that I'm sure will last much longer than the flimsy bike he used to have. I do really like the fact that it has both pedal brakes and hand brakes-he can use the pedal brakes until he's more coordinated and has bigger hands, but he thinks the hand brakes make it look like a big boy's bike.My husband put together the bike without a huge problem but got very frustrated that Schwinn seems to make one instruction manual that is used for all of its bikes. It made it very difficult to determine which directions were for this particular bike and which weren't."
2,TOO HEAVY,"I wish I had heeded the other reviewers about this product. It is well made, built like a tank and there lies the problem: it weighs like a tank also. It is extremely heavy. I bought it for my 5 year old grandson. He won't ride it because it is so heavy. Again, it is built extremely well with an extreme weight!"
3,Shorter showers,"Bought this timer to cut down the time I spend in the shower. Translates to real savings heating the hot water, and it's worked fine for months. Used ""Magic Mount tape"" to stick it to the shower tile, as it wasn't really designed for that. It would be nice if it remembered the time to count down and not not need to be manually reset each time (just a couple of button presses though), but it's saving me money, so I'll put up with it."
3,Water Aerobics Timer,Easy to orderQuick to shipGood priceUsed to time aerobics exercises in the pool.Just what we expected from Amazon.
3,Its waterproof alright,"This thing is meant to be placed upright. It will take on water if layed on the side. The good thig is that when it dries out, it will work again. I would rate it higher if it shipped with a suction option for those of us w/o metal in the shower."
4,Very good for the price,"This toolbox is an imported copy of the Gerstner G052. The drawers have solid oak fronts with cheaper wood sides and backs. The drawer bottoms are 1/8th felt-topped fiberboard. The case is a combination of 1/2"" solid oak and veneered woods. Without close examination, no part of the case appears to be anything other than solid oak. All the joints in the product are tongue and groove. Joint imperfections, and there many of these, are ""fixed"" with oak colored wood filler. Empty weight is about 50 lbs. My only complaint is that the drawers are too loose in the slides. The excessive side-to-side slop betrays a lower manufacturing quality."
5,great chest,"Beautiful and well built, I have found several great uses for the chest, along with the lower one I already had."
4,The Space of Love,"Each book in the series gets better and fills in the spaces from the first Anastasia book. What is interesting, is that a lot of our friends and neighbors have been starting this path prior to reading this series. Maybe part of the reason we are drawn to the book series."
1,MONO TRANSFER IS FLAT,This album from the country music foundation is from a MONO master tape. The music sounds flat and also lacks good fidelity. You can get the STEREO version of this album from SUNDAZED on CD at this site. The sound is 100% better and brighter in STEREO.
3,These poker chips certainly won't sweeten the pot,"While manufacturing quality is nothing to brag or depricate, these poker chips are sub-optimal, as both deomocrates and paleo-conservatives will likely underplay if these are on offer for any game. As with all political chostchkies, this is funny at first, and less amusing each time they are used. Better poker chips are out there."
2,Poor Macintosh OSX Compatibility,"Zero documentation for installation and setup on Mac -- I had to download a PDF from their website and ultimately email Belkin Tech Support for help.Once I got the mouse basically working, I asked them how to configure the various buttons. Out of the box, the side button does nothing. Belkin told me ""We don't have any special software to program the buttons but you may be able to find a third-party application""!! Clearly their Mac OSX support is an afterthought. My advice: Wait and buy one that really IS compatible."
1,Belkin Bluetooth Mouse and Apple don't mix,"Belkin advertises their F8T041-B Blutooth Mouse as compatible with Apple products if you have OS 10.2.6 or above, but it is not full featured. Don't be lured into thinking it has 4 buttons plus a scroll wheel. After 15 days of email and a 50 minute phone call, I was told by their support staff that my 2 buttons and the scroll wheel is the best it can do.Okay, so they don't make all the features for Apple that they do for Windows users, what else is new? My only gripe is that it is advertised on their product box and elswhere that it works with OS X. It doesn't mention that if you pay the same amount of money and use it on an Apple computer you don't get all the features.I had to pay shipping to receive this product and now must pay to return it. None of that money will be returned to me. I hope Belkin makes a lot of money making products for OS X. But I also hope they make the products up to the grade of their advertisements."
3,History Buffs,"You really have to love the Civil War to enjoy this book. I'm reading it for a class. Yes, there are some chapters which are a little interesting. But overall, I just don't find American history that fascinating."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Spotter for more power than my 10X42 Nikon Monarch binoculars but the optics are nowhere near as clear and sharp. Even though the image is larger, it appears out of focus it is weak and unresolved compared to the Monarch. I put it to a hard test, viewing a Space Shuttle launch from 11 miles away but I could compare the two before the launch looking at the launch pad. I was attracted by the price of the Spotter against the more expensive Nikon Fieldscopes but now I wish I had not purchased it and saved for a better scope. I know some people love these Spotters. Now that I have it I will use it in the field and I hope I am not as disappointed as I have been so far."
2,The product I received was not tyvek,"I just got paper envelopes. They work fine and are well made, but should not be labeled as Tyvek. Perhaps a fluke?"
4,One of the Best of the Global Grooves Set,"Global Grooves is one of the better dance/circuit CD series on the market. Track 7 (Angel of Mine) you will recognize from the slower radio edit version. I wasn't a fan of this song until I heard this bass pumping version. Honey is the most compelling track with the haunting lyrics of Billie Ray Martin. This is probably her best song and the best on the CD. The Boy George track is a classic, but it is pretty common among similar various artists CD's - nothing new there. The last two tracks will grow on you. They aren't very substantial lyrically, but they round out the CD well."
5,Dear gunner9474,"you obviously haven't read the lyrics to this song, have you? it isn't suggesting that we should literally murder our kids. it's actually a meaningful social commentary on how we're ""killing"" them and their childhoods when we force them to grow up in broken homes. so please please PLEASE make sure you know what you're talking about before spreading lies about such a great band and some awesome dudes. thank you."
1,Tasteless,"Hey, I'm a metalhead through & through. The music touches all types of subjects that mainstream society won't go near. Violence, Satanism, Death & War. All are fair game. However, a song called ""Kill Your Children"" is where I'd draw the line. I suppose none of these idiots have kids."
1,Think Again,"My friend told me this Dj was off the hook but never told me he spun ambient trance, allthou it is not my style of music I have herd much better sets of ambient trance and would not recomend this Dj at all. I ended up selling it to a friend who thought it was good to go to sleep too."
4,Funky.,"I feel kind of guilty giving this work ""only"" 4-stars. But it is still a good, solid album though. There's definitely a smoothness about it; almost funky. I didn't really like the breaks in between the tracks, but being very new to this type of music, I may be off the mark. All in all it's worth picking up for home use."
1,Great... For kids,"I really had high hopes for this book. We have two beautiful half Friesian's and would love to learn as much as we can about this breed. Although this book has amazing photos in it, the content is geared more for kids."
3,"A Good ""Starter"" for your delve into the Battle for Okinawa","A cursory, almost story-book rendering of the Battle for Okinawa. My favorite feature of this book is the many simple maps of the various areas throughout the Pacific Theater of Operations.In only 185 pages of relatively large print, this book treats the Pacific war from the morning of December 7th, 1941 to the signing of the surrender aboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945.This is an excellent ""starter"" book for the novice historian or curious reader."
4,A Good Read,"I took this book out from the library, and I was a little concerned about the golf ball on the cover. I hate golf. Still, the synopsis on the jacket looked good. I read the entire book in one day. Adam is a great leading character. He has real problems with authority, and a good sense of humor. He gets into incredibly dangerous scrapes and is human enough to wonder what the heck he was thinking, while still pulling them off. His girlfriend is a strong, intelligent woman, his sister is a raving witch, and the suspects are suitably weird. The story is witty and absorbing, and includes great descriptions of the beauty of the Oregon coast.Read this one, you won't regret it."
4,"Nice product, but not all quality parts","This is a nice product and delivers as promised. However, there are some pieces that are not made too sturdy. For example, the hand pulleys you use to pull your body up and down on the slider are attached by very small parts (sorry I'm not a mechanic) that easily break if pulled from the wrong angle. For example, one of the exercises calls for sitting on the slider sideways and pulling the handles in one direction (imagine holding both handles in two clasped hands together). Within a few seconds, the metal part bent out of shape and the pulley popped out. That's not too sturdy. I was able to fix it but I don't trust the machine for that exercise. Otherwise, so far so good..."
5,"Great machine, much better than the Infomercial Machine","I have had my Total Trainer for about 3 years. It is built very well, and I have had zero problems with it. With the variety of exercises that you can do with this machine, there is no way you can get bored working out on it. In fact, many of the exercises I haven't even tried, since there are so many to chose from. The level of adjustments are much better that the ones on the Total Gym which sells for 3 times the price and isn't built as well, or is as versatile as the Total Trainer.The machine comes with every attachment you need and to switch from one exercise to another, including changing the attachments takes seconds. This machine will last forever in my opinion and will give you a heck of a workout."
3,Redhawk grip... Ehhhhh,This grip is just ok. First off its not really rubber. More like a soft plastic. It's very hollow so all the sound of the internal mechanisms is amplified which is a serious problem if you use your pistol for any kind of hunting. Just cocking the hammer back makes a very deep clunking sound. However it does fit a lot nicer in your hand than a pachmayr. This grip places your hand lower on the hilt which I like because with a pachmayr the recoil caused the cyclinder to contact my thumb during shot which made it so I couldn't shoot it comfortably.
4,Good receiver. Get it if you need PC connectivity,"I like this receiver very much. I am not an audio pro, so I will not talk about sound quality and so on. To me it sounds good and that is all there is. However, I am more on PC side of things and I got it to wirlessly connect to my laptop, so I can control the music in the house from any place. Wireless works great. The USB transmitter that plugs into a USB port intalls itself and configures OS to run sound through it. A true PnP device. I have connected it to Sony SS-f7000 speakers and the two work great together. The only thing I did not like was turning it up all the way. The sound was loud, but not unbearable and it got a hissing sound in the background, which may be caused by bad recording quality, speakers or th receiver. Listening on normal volume is a true pleasure."
4,Good receiver but a little confusing,"I am not into the home theater stuff but do like my stereo. This receiver sounds great and the wireless PC connection prevented me from having to look for a CD player that can play MP3's. For someone not familiar with home theater, connecting this can be confusing. To me it would have been helpful if the instructions had said which connections can be used for stereo components (e.g., I ended up with the CD changer connected via the TV audio input). The receiver does sound great though and has some nice (but also confusing) set-up items."
4,My friend loved it!!!,"I got this for my friend - he turned 30 this year...and he loved it...he was so shocked as he open the box and saw all the different kinds of candies from way back ""80s""Def a cute gift idea."
2,Bad Service on Amazon,"I have just received notice of shipment of this item. I was purchased on the 1st of March. It took 11 days to ship!!!!!!!!!! This is the second time that I have ordered something on Amazon that did not ship for a long time after it had been ordered. This is awful, and I don't think I plan on ordering anything from Amazon in the future! They also never tell you when something is backordered till a few days after you order. This is unacceptable!!!Gloria Souyias"
2,It is cool as a concept but some of the music sucks,"I got this because I love Chicks on Speed. They are one of my favorite bands out there today. But I have to say this compilation isn't very good. The idea of having women musicians on 3 CD's is a great one, but the music suffers from mediocrity. A lot of the tracks I wouldn't even consider music, its just women talking away with a keyboard mixer in the back. I am not hearing the quality of musicianship here. With that said I'm not regretful that I bought it, because there are some good tracks here. Such as Chicks on Speed, Le Tigre, Pam Hogg and Ana Da Silva. Yeah the rest of it though thumbs down. Sorry"
4,NYPD Emergency Service Unit,"The NYPD ESU is one of the best tactical and rescue units in the states (and in the entire world). They handle everything from a car wreck, a child lost, an emotinally disturbed person or a hostage rescue, that's also include drug warrant. You have a lot of this in the video. The exception is there's nothing about the dignitary protection provide by the ESU to the UN General Assembly and other dignitaries visiting the Big Apple. For more about NYPD ESU you can check Samuel Katz books. EA"
4,A Great Feel-Good Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is really, really good! I bought this, kind of on a whim since it was only a couple of cents. I figured it would be fun, but I wouldn't listen to it too much. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by how great it was! Not only are the songs that everyone knows good (especially my favorite, Colonel Hathi's March, which we get two tracks of!) but the background music was equally good, like the Overture.This is a great feel-good soundtrack, sure to put you in a good mood!"
4,great chunky ring,I am really enjoying this ring. It is true to size and is very comfortable to wear. Good find for the money. Everything I have purchased from Eve's Addiction has been great.
5,Great listenable jazz,The artists on these selections are superb jazz improvisors . I'm a long time fan of Beegee Adair . I'm 69 years old . I know jazz . She plays the most tasteful jazz piano around bar none !!!
4,A Great Price for a nice stacker,"My grandson is here during the week and so I bought this stacker to keep his diapers in. The problem I had was when I hung it up, the hanger broke. A regular adult hanger is too big so I ended up using an adult skirt hanger which worked at fine. I cannot complain, the price was really good."
3,"Good text and photos, but narrower coverage than you'd think","The book has outstanding photos, and a decent text--More detail than in a field manual, but not as much as in (for instance) the Sibley book on bird behavior. Unfortunately, it focuses on birds of the Northern Prairie--Canada, Montana, and the Dakotas mostly. This is shown via a map near the front of the book, but not mentioned on the front or back cover.The big strength of the book is the photos. Excellent photos. I enjoy the book, even though the region is not my preferred one."
2,slightly irritated,"I guess ""Natural Color"" means really bad orange paint on a haphazardly sanded product. The case is a little too snug, but it does hold the violin. We bought this as a ""try and see"" instrument, and if my kid sticks with it, we'll definitely be investing in a MUCH better violin. This one is little better than of toy quality. Keep that in mind if purchasing this violin."
5,A really great collection of songs,"This is one of those CDs that has a sound that is really all its own and it is hard to pigeon hole. I'd say 9 out of the 11 songs are fantastic and really fun and different sounding, yet united through a common thread. The best song is Birthday Girl which has an underlying sadness to the lyrics and a real sense of urgency to the music. It is an impressive song. You'll find your own favorite songs if you get it, so I won't go describing them one by one. If you like the Pixies, Yo La Tengo, or The Flaming Lips or any kind of punky-pop music you will find something to groove to on this album. Check it out."
4,follow up cd with a dark image to the band,very long awaited follow up to the bands first lp this one brings to you a new darker side of the band and keeps fans happy with yoo hoo which is very kewl and brings alot of music pleasure to teen fans
4,"a worthy follow up to their fantastic ""seasick""","this disc is a little darker than their last one but almost as catchy. ""yoo hoo"" is one of those songs that sticks in your head for hours and drives you crazy. i love how the happy hooks are paired with the cynical lyrics! after bouncing along with the first ten songs they wind you down with the haunting ""beauty"". it's a crime that this band is not better known!"
3,We all have to suffer somehow.,"Despite how intimidating accounting can be for some students, this book really offers a lot. From the CD to the neat little transparencies in chapter 4, this book does give students a greater insight to accounting. Unfortunately, I feel that the book offers too much to students. Icons are all over the place in the book, examples that go nowhere, and page references for problems that actually don't help at all. You have to sift through the chapters yourself to find the right page.If you have to buy it, buy it... But get all the add ons, they're great to have.P.S. When in doubt, go to the website, they have great narrated powerpoint presentations on each chapter!"
2,Powels sent wrong edition of book,"I received the wrong edition (17th) of ""Working Papers Volume 1, chapters 1-12 for use with Fundamental Accounting Principles""Kermit D. Larson; Paperback; $18.75I need edition 18th for Working papers volume 1 chapt. 1-12 can this be corrected? Still waiting to hear from Powels books..."
4,Modern Life Is Beautiful,"When I first bought this CD, I immediately disliked it. As a follow-up to Leisure I thought it was weak. But slowly the weird, singular style of this group and it's pop songs with their seemingly disjointed chords began to grow on me. Much credit needs to go to bassist Alex James for making sense of the experimental, unorthodox key changes.Standout tracks include 'Pressure On Julian', 'Starshaped', 'Chemical World', 'Miss America', 'Villa Rosie', and 'Turn It Up'. Also included are three songs which were on CD singles: 'Pop Scene', 'Peach', & 'When The Cows Come Home' all of which are interesting.I love this band because it has a great sense of humor (as heard on 'Coping' and on the funny break ditties) which is sorely lacking in most of today's modern life.[DW]"
5,Excellent sophomore effort from Blur!,"After the promise of 1991's Leisure, Blur finally offer up a masterpiece of recording with their second album! Damon Albarn decided to write songs with a decidedly British slant, both lyrically and musically, and along the great musicianship of Graham Coxon, Alex James, and Dave Rowntree, produced this wonderful album. Landmark cuts include the jaw-dropping For Tomorrow, Chemical World, Starshaped, Oily Water, Sunday Sunday, and Blue Jeans. Although the quality drops a tad near the end of the album, overall this is a tight, wonderful album. American fans should buy the USA version, as it's the only place you can get Blur's amazing 1992 one-off single Popscene."
4,"good, but no song can ever match up to beetlebum!","This was a wonderous album, it has many great wrench tracks, but nothin like good ol' beetlebum, i adore beetlebum. its the wrench with stuff in my ear. But buy this album, cuz blur DOES rule, and they ARE good, and beetlebum is my FAVORITE song ever (except a few by type o negative and bjork). But buy this, its good wrench stuff!"
1,sluggish,"i'm not a blur fan. i only heard 2 songs from them from the radio. but when you guys gave their albums 4.5 to 5 stars.. i immediately went to the stores and bought myself a copy of this great album according to you guys. but when i popped it in to my cd player in my car, oh man, i made a terrible mistake. i listened to the whole cd on my way home and when i got there, i played it once again because i thought maybe my ears will get comfortable after the second time. but now it's already my fifth time trying to dig this album, trying to get the songs to play on my head but nope, no success. 13 was even worse. i'd rather listen to Radiohead, Supergrass, and OASIS. such a letdown, such a waste.. who wants a Blur cd? i'm so embarassed to have this POS as a part of my collection. blur sucks."
3,Fun.,"I read in an interview once that this album was made during a weekend they were stoned in the studio. In another interview I read about Richard telling he can't make music when he isn't clear. This sums up the album pretty good.It is nowhere near any complexity or seriousness. It is just very funny. Definitely easy to listen to, but in my case it doesn't hold my attention that long. For me it was worth the listen since James and Paradinas are on my list as favorite artists (just below Autechre). If you are looking for ""good"" music with a deeper meaning, this album just won't cut it. But it does on the other hand."
3,Only for completists -3 stars is being generous,"The best thing about this is the cover art. Not bad, but hardly ranking as essential for Richard D James fans, or Mike Paradinas fans. This is sort of pleasant but lacks most of the personality or unique tone that pervades almost every other thing Richard D James has released."
3,Two awesome artists come up with a just average album.,"The problem here is, Mike Paradinas or Richard D James didnt want to ""take control"" when making this album. Neither of the duo didnt ""take lead"" and as a result, there arn't really any memorable tracks, apart from possibly ""vodka"". These two electronic legends are both amazing, and have both produced numerous classic albums, so it is a bit of a dissapointment, they simply didnt live up to their names. I heard a rumour that this ""album"" was made in only a weekend when they were both wasted, believe me it sounds like it. Oh, and as for 'technos first comedy album' I didnt laugh once. Still, I love both the artists, so it looks nice with my other album on my CD rack!"
3,could have been a lot better,"Coming from Richard D James and Mike Paradinas, you would expect something a lot better. Instead of genius idm or braindance, this is an album of...kind of subpar wierd electronica.It's not too bad. But don't buy it expecting something world-shattering and incredible. I'd suggest either getting Richard or Mike's work by themselves. Experimental-Electronic-music-prodigies don't play together well.It does however, have at least two standout tracks in Bu Bu Bu Ba(which is the only track I'd say is genius) and Upright Kangaroo."
5,The Best of Both Worlds,"Long before dubbed episodes of S and Super S came out, I had gotten my hands on subtitled versions of those series's. I have to admit, the dubbed Sailormoon does stray somewhat from the original version; however, the dubbed version of the S and Super S series's are much better than the original DIC dubs of the first two series's. As with the features, I expect Pioneer to include the original and the dubbed tracks on the DVD. Whether you like the dub or the original, this DVD should satisfy both needs. I prefer the subititled versions, but even I have to admit that the dub has its high points. Anyway, I support Pioneer fully in their release of this wonderful anime and hope that they continue to support Sailormoon."
4,SM S,"Well I think I got the uncut version, but it just might be how the english dubbing is going, because it has the uncut opening/closing, and titling. I haven't seen anything different though from when I watched it on CN, and in episode 6, it was said that the two new scouts where cousains. So will see if anything different shows up later.Over all it is still a good series, though my favorite is still the first season, which I do hope gets released on dvd uncut so I can see all the parts they cut for time, and the missing episode they cut all together near the end."
4,Careful!,"If you're thinking of buying the Geneon Signature Series Version of these heart collections, DON'T! Not unless you want to pay less and don't care about the PACKAGING. When I bought it, I figured the cover would have that ugly red logo on the front.....and it did. I didn't know that it wouldn't have a reversable cover! There's nothing on the back of it! Just blank. The CD itself doesn't have a beautiful picture of Usagi, like it's supposed to. Instead, it's all red with white letters. And instead of the correct insert flap with a picture of Usagi and Mamoru, there's an insert advertising other DVDs! I wouldn't have bought these if I knew of the horrible packaging. >_< I knew there was a catch!So...unless you don't care how the DVD cover looks to you, you should buy this. But for those of you who know how beautiful the REVERSABLE cover, CD, and insert flap is supposed to be, please just buy the regular DVDs. Even if it is twice the cash.The four stars are all for the show NOT the DVD."
4,A pretty good start for the best Sailormoon season,"Sailor Moon S is my favorite season - it introduces the outer sailor soldiers, who are, in my opinion, the coolest group in the whole show. They provide great contrast to the others. Uranus and Neptune's realtionship is portrayed beautifully, also, which is a good enough reason on it's own to buy this. The only reason I give this volume 4 stars instead of 5 is because Sailor Moon S doesn't get *really* good until about 1/3 through... It's still a great DVD though, and tons better than that crap on TV. The japanese cast is amazingly good."
3,I've seen the uncut version and studied it's geared grp.,"Sailor Moon is edited for it's geared audience in the United States. The Japanese version includes such content as homosexuality because it's acceptable in their culture. I would only rent this. I prefer the North American version of Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon R & Sailor Moon Supers and possibly Sailor Moon Sailor Stars over this one. I wouldn't bother buying this DVD because of the content(Homosexuality). I wouldn't endorse such behavior in a cartoon regardless of it's geared age group."
2,"if you're a true fan, don't waste your money","true fans of the sailor moon series will know that despite saying ""uncut"" these dvds are heavily edited. dic, cloverway, and now pionner have changed a great deal of the main story to ""protect"" the american audience. for instance, in the orignial series, zoycite was orginaly a guy, but because he was in a homosexual relationship with malachite (kuncite in the manga), they decided to make him a her. in this series, the main diference is haruka and michiru are not cousins, they are lesbian lovers. this is the story in both the manga and the orignial japanise cartoon. however, for those who can't get the original, this is an acceptable, tho poor substitute."
2,I love Sailor Moon can't rate this version 5 stars,I only gave it 2 stars because it is Sailor Moon! I would never recommend this due to Uranus and Neptune's relationship. I find their love affair offensive. If you find same sex relationships offensive stick to the dubbed and edited edition Sailor Moon! It only ruins the positive entertainment value for me. I hope some day they would make dubbed and edited DVD versions of Sailor Moon Episodes and Movies!
5,No need for warnings!,"There may be confusion or hate on the part of some of this subtitled Sailor Moon series, but please form your own opinion. Yes, Michiru and Haruka (Sailors Uranus and Neptune) are lovers, but please keep an open mind about it, it only strengthens the series, and the development of the characters of the series. One thing I wonder is that why nobody is causing much controversy of the Usagi/Mamoru (Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask) relationship... They're made in the same way, two people in love who share a common mission. About the series, this is the only entire Sailor Moon subtitled series I have seen, (Fansubs are a true gift from the sky) but I'm sure this will remain my favorite, it's extremely emotional, exciting, and humorous, and the characters have much depth to them. Please keep an open mind!"
5,FINALLY Sailor Moon uncut!,I was waiting forever for the uncut version to come! The dubbed version is crap made for 5 year olds.
1,Works ok until software becomes corrupt...,"Save your money and buy something else. This is our second unit, first one lasted less than a year, second one less than 6 months. Motorolla replaced the first one, but said we were now out of warranty on the second. The unit displays 0000. This happened after I scanned for new channels and saw an odd looking channel with numbers and letters, curiosity got the best of me and I tried clicking on it to tune it in, then the zeros came. Motorolla said this corrupted the software and they only thing that could be done was to replace the unit. We tried unplugging for a few days, holding in on the power button to reset,...but nothing."
1,HDT-101 has a known defect,"I bought a used HDT-101 and now wish I hadn't. It worked great for about 6 months and then locked up, it wouldn't do anything. The display said 0000. I called Motorola tech support hoping they could tell me how to do a reset. They admitted this is a known chipset problem and the only option is replacement of the unit. Since I'm not the origional owner they won't do anything for me.Update: After a lot of talking and writing the departments listed on the Motorola website they have agreeed to take the unit back and refund what I paid for it. This was a surprise to me and actually I wanted them to repair or replace it but this is fine with me. Since I bought it used I am very surprised they would go this route instead of repair/replacement. This unit has been discontinued."
1,A Complete Lemon...Motorola should be prosecuted for selling it !!,"Like Rich Lo, I bought my first Motorola HDT101 from Circuit City, took it home, plugged it in....and nothing, completely dead. I should have simply gotten a $300 refund and bought a different HD receiver, but instead I foolishly accepted another new unit in exchange. The second HD101 functioned beautifully, for a while, but occasionally would ""lock up"" showing only 0000 on the screen until it was unplugged, allowed to cool, and restarted. This went on for several months until it finally died completely.So now I am stuck with an admittedly defective product that Motorola will not repair or replace, and since Circuit City has gone out of business, I can't even demand a refund from them. LESSON 1: Read the Amazon reviews before buying, it can save you a lot of money and frustration. LESSON 2: Avoid Motorola products."
3,+ 1/2 stars...A Delightful Collection,"With a wink to HBO's popular series ""Sex and the City,"" Varese Sarabande has compiled nearly an hour's worth of terrific songs and guilty pleasures. While few of these songs were bona fide hits (""Music to Watch Girls By,"" ""Remember (Walkin' In the Sand),"" ""How Does That Grab You, Darlin'?"" and ""Goldfinger"" charted in the US; ""Alfie"" and ""Girl Don't Come"" were UK top ten hits), what Baby Boomer won't recognize the theme music from The Avengers or The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.?But the real treats are the TV commercial songs like Edie Adams' ""Hey Big Spender"" (for Muriel Cigars) and ""Take It off! Take It All Off!"" (for Noxema Shaving Cream). Also, several of these songs are making their CD debut, like Twiggy's 1967 rare debut single ""Over and Over"" and Donna Loren's ""Love's a Secret Weapon"" from the 1964 film Bikini Beach. This could quite possibly be the party album of the year! RECOMMENDED"
2,Wish there was another option.,"This book is difficult to work with. The organization of the book is poor and I wish my professor had another option for us to use. It has been hard to find enough information to write my essays on easy topics, the glossary is limited, and there is alot of text crammed into small pages. I am a 4.0 grad student and this book is the most difficult I have ever worked with. I suppose the information is solid but it is not very through and could use a better layout. Use it if you have no other option."
2,Wasn't worth the price I paid,"First of all, it is very difficult to find instructional DVDs on the subjects of gift wrapping and gift baskets. I was excited when I first found this because I thought it would provide inspiration and some additional instruction. Unfortunately, it only gave me limited inspiration. I thought that it might give me some more how-to instruction but was seriously disappointed that it only taught me how to measure a box to wrap a gift and nothing more. If that wasn't bad enough the bad jokes, crass wisecracks and just unnecessary humor was extremely distracting to the purpose of the DVD (I don't even think she smiled during the whole DVD). If the ""host"" spent more time on the instructional and left out her horrible wisecracks this might have actually been a decent instructional video. I believe the author has good information to share but it seems that I need to buy the book in order to get it. Disappointing to say the least!"
5,2009 Honda Civic,I installed the k&n oil filter along with the k&n replacement air filter on my 09 CIVIC..very happy with the performance of my car.
5,Excellent product!!,Bought it for my 09 Lancer ES best investment keeps the oil running much quicker than the stock ones. Will order them again when i need more.
5,Oil filter for Honda Ridgeline,The filter came very quickly along with the Royal Purple synthetic oil. It fit perfectly with no leaks. It has met all expectations so far.
4,"Standard filter, does the job","Nothing special, but it's cheap, it fits, and it does the job. I've been using these for a couple changes now and my engine is running really well. They're a bit slippery to remove with oil on your hands, but that's nothing unique to them!"
1,Was a loyal customer,"Just came back from a 1000 mile trip today, 500 hundred miles into the trip I noticed oil leaking from the bottom of my car and smoke. Had to break off the belly pan since I did not have any tools, discovered oil was leaking from the nut that is used to remove the filter. So here we were stuck and ended up having to pay $80 dollars for an oil change and new filter. I understand this may have just been a flaw in this one but I am going to stick with normal oil filters from now on. I also need a new underbelly shield since I had to break off the old one."
3,Fram Tough Guard is Better for Less Money,"I have a 2003 Honda Odyssey. I use full-synthetic Mobil oil. I change my oil 1x a year. I figure if my BMW's schedule oil is 1x a year, why can't I do it with Honda? I bought the K&N oil filter ($10) and Mobil full-synthetic oil. For the first 6k miles, it works well. You would need to change oil/filter every 6k miles. A friend told me about the Fram Tough Guard filter ($6), and after 6k miles, oil is still clean. At 10k miles, it was marginal. I used to think K&N oil filter was better, but not anymore. I will go with Fram Tough Guard from now on."
5,great filter for the money,"I purchase this oil filter for infiniti M45 and infiniti G35 and have used them on the civic Si, Rx-8, and nissan 95 240sx with a sr20det s14 VTC type. I keep them around because they work on a plethora of engines: honda K20/24 & J30 V6, Rx-8's rotary, Nissan S14 SR20det, VQ35/37/40, VK45, VR38DETT, mitsubishi 4b11 (evo X) and 4g63(evo 8/9/ eclipse) and many more.The nut is a life saver in tight spaces, and especially on the new 2006+ civics Si which have a very tight and confined installation space. As for filtering i've taken an old one apart and noted the filter media is very high quality i'd say as good or maybe better than most oem filters.I recommend it, it's a good filter just to keep around/ have since it works on just about anything my friends have."
5,You'll never go wrong with K&N,"I've been using the K&N oil filters for a few years now, great product. it filters oil better than most oil filters out there. oil flow is smooth, I recommend K&N oil filter to everyone out there that does not use it or has not discovered it yet."
1,Not what I expected,"The songs are re-recordings in a studio apparently by some or all members of the original bands. They are similar to the original songs, but they defintely are *not* the original recordings. Very disappointing."
1,It's crap!,"Believe the other reviewers! ""Original artists"" they may be, but they are NOT the original songs. Why would someone make crap like this I don't know. No one buying ""retro"" music would want these versions."
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"This set of discs is a total SCAM!!! Musicians, living and DEAD, should sue the craphounds that put this out. I did not read the reviews either and this was a total rip-off of my money and the original artist's names. Amazon should remove this total crap set from it's catalog. Not to mention that the discs weren't secure because the spindles were broken. I would share more harsh words but, it would be audited. ONE STAR BECAUSE THERE ARE ANY LOWER THAN THAT."
5,We all go a little crazy sometimes....,"Quarte has gone insane after watching the death of his father at the hands of OZ. Quarte starts to destory colonies with a very powerful gundam, The Gundam they called Zero. Heero and Trowa are ordered to destory the new mobile suit, but Quarte ends up almost killing Trowa. After the battle with Heero and Quarte, there is no telling that Trowa is alive or dead.The best of the Gundam Wing DVD's!"
3,Not Worth $100.00,This item is not worth $100.00. This stand in my opinion is worth $50.00 including the shipping. Do not pay anymore then that. I like the microwave stand but it is very cheaply made.There are a lot nicer ones out there for 100.00. I had no problem putting it together but the worst directions I have ever seen for assembling a product. The tab fill in for the screws continually fall out so I had to super glue them and there are flaws all over the wood. Worth $50.00 but feel robbed spending $100.00. I posted a review yesterday but for some reason Amazon never posted my review!
5,Easy install,This was a super easy install and the wrench socket in the end will make for a quick and easy replacement as the location is not conducive to fitting a filter wrench up there. Excellent price when comparing around as well.
5,Top of the line.,Keeps the oil the color of oil when it comes to change time. I feel safe running it on my engine.
5,GREAT for my 1999 F150,"I always had trouble changing my oil filter until I bought this filter. Now I can use a ratchet, socket and long extension to easily reomove and install it."
5,Good product,"I absolutely hate taking my car somewhere to get an oil change. Whenever I can do it myself, I do... K&N Filters are pretty good and worth the price. 1"" wrench take off makes it really easy too."
5,so funny,"not only for children this 3 episode video has the cutest episode about babies. Children and adults alike will like the second episode about babysitting. Tenchi and his 5 alien ""girlfriends"" have to watch a baby for a couple days. My kids love it and it is fun to watch with them."
5,Lovely Baby Classics CD is not just for babies,"The Lovely Baby Clasics CD is delightful and refreshing to hear. Hearing actual baby noises in the background is a clever way to attract the baby's interest. It also works for adults! The chosen selections are truly classical and therefore, educational; I enjoy listening to these classics while meditating, reading, or letter writing. This would be a wonderful (and greatly appreciated) gift for a new mother, for a baby shower, for a pre-school to play at any time during the day, for babies who go to sleep with music playing or simply for adults and children to listen to at home."
4,Icelandic history axed,"An excellent saga, written in an abrupt style. It has a wide scope that takes it beyond a tale of a particular person or family, as the central figure, Njal, isn't always at the centre of the action.It's hard to empathise with the characters, but their travels, vendettas and family squabbles are quite engaging. Law, honour and violence play big parts in the lives of the Icelanders. There are extensive 'court scenes', backed up by explanatory notes from the editor, and some of the finer points of Icelandic custom are similarly explained.It does tail off a bit at the end, and it's not a book with much poetic description of the people or surroundings, but the actual story is a great one."
3,Violent vendetta's in Viking times...,"This is a tale of familial antagonisms, fights and vendetta's which escalate over a fifty-year period and culminate in an act of brutal mass-murder which is soon avenged...Though the style takes a while to get used to, this is an interesting and often funny saga. The characters are vividly portrayed and their entertaining travails, plots and adventures keep one absorbed. The violence is described in a strange way but this is quite comical, as many of the Vikings make statements and asides just before they die - 'That was a hand of wickedness anyway', says one warrior after his hand is hewn off by an axe. It is over-the-top and exaggerated violence, with decapitations and disembowling. The story itself can be a bit disjointed and it does trail off towards the end, but this is a fun little book nevertheless."
5,He's The One,"At the sound of their voices, I was captivated by the Gospel. I was intrigued enough to tell my church family and friends to go out and by their loving voices. If you have never listened to Gospel music, then this should be your start."
2,not as advertised,"Just regular coca tea in regular tea bags, so I'm not sure why all the advertisement about Bio-Packs (Israeli biotechnology). Also I have not felt any increase in energy."
1,Poor map,"Buy the Cartographia ""Crotia Slovenia"" map instead. This map is less detailed (1:550,000 instead of 1:500,000), just shows roads without topography such as mountains, and the map ends at Croatia's borders. Considering how convoluted Croatia's borders are, you might wander into a blank space. :-) Plus this map is bigger so it doesn't fit in your pack as easily."
1,Worse than Worthless Map,"This map was very disappointing. The map only shows small parts of Hong Kong and Kowloon and many of most important tourist sites, such as the Temple Night Market and Victoria Peak, are not shown on the map but only indicated by an arrow where they are off the map. There is nothing for the large number of trails and buildings at the top of Victoria Peak. Other big tourist sites are not mentioned at all, such as the Jade Market and Ladies Market. Even worse than missing information, though, is the incorrect information. For instance, The map labels the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre as the Hong Kong Museum of History--even though it also shows the real Hong Kong History Museum several inches away on the same map. That is just lazy and sloppy editing. There may be more errors, but I stopped using too quickly to find more."
3,Fairly typical Euro Symphonic Metal,"This album didn't have all that much going for it, other than it sounds quite a bit like other bands with stronger songwriting.It'd be quite a bit better with a different tone on the guitars, synth, however. Sounds kind of cheap to me.Still, catchy for being fairly typical of the genre."
5,Female Fronted Symphonic,"There is a saying that goes something like this..""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" Well, in regard to this musical group, my opinion is that Lunatica is a thing of beauty. I can honestly say that this group gets more listening enjoyment from me than any other music in my vast collection. That being said, I know that this group is much softer than many of the symphonic groups out there, but that is a good thing for me. I'm not much for the growling vocals of many of the groups or the headache-producing guitar riffs. Again, ""one man's junk is another man's treasure."""
4,Female fronted metal!,"This band bears a striking resemblance to Nightwish as most people have pointed out, though at times Nightwish get a faster more aggressive sound going. I think that singer Andrea has a haunting angelic voice which is the strongest point of the band. The songs are mid tempo melodic metal with a touch of symphonic via the keyboardist Alex. It was mixed and mastered by well known producer Sascha Paeth so you can be assured the quality of the recording sounds great. I could've done with a little more aggression to the music, hence the 4 star rating, but it makes for a pleasant listen for the band is very tight and Andrea's vocals are enchanting. I would recommend this if you like bands in the vein of Nightwish."
2,A stepping stone to bigger things,"I can't justify giving this album more than two stars - what with such more accomplished female fronted rock out there at the moment. But don't be put off totally. The lass has a good voice, though perhaps not strong enough (like Amy of Evanescence or Nightwishs' former warbler Tarja) but as long as they build songs around this point then the future may be bright.A band of solid enough musos has created some interesting points in songs like Neverending Story and Spell. At the time of writing they were making their third album and this could be a pivotal release for them. The fact that this album made some headway into the charts of their native Switzerland at least will hopefully give them a springboard for bigger things."
5,"Do It Best 3/8"" Nut Driver",Great Product @ a Great Price! No Complaints & Fast Shipping. Saved my Company a Bunch of Money!
4,"Actually drains properly, unlike every other drain board I've tried","Rubbermaid actually got it right with this drain board, which is designed with sufficient thickness, strength, support and slant to actually drain properly without warping or pooling. I removed one star because this only seems to come in the small/medium size and thus won't fit many dish racks. It happens to be perfect for my dish rack and kitchen area, but is too small for my sister's dish rack."
1,"If it leaks, why would you buy it???","I had one of these units and it ended up it the trash after 18 months of use.Mine leaked all over the floor and carpet.Since these units are prone to leakage, why would anyone buy it?Replacing carpets and wood is an expensive proposition, perhaps far more than the unit costs.Forget service. No one services these units."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the Soleus thinking that quality comes from the price and advertising; however, I was mistaken. Although the installation was simple it only became a problem there after.First my unit kept having an E3 error message which apparently means my air conditioner is working so well that it has internal frost. It then stops cooling the air and waits for itself to defrost. So every 5 minutes or so it would stop working even if the air temp was above 80 degrees.I didn't mind too much thinking the company would help since they vouch great costumer service. They have yet to call me back or respond via email. If you call their costumer service hotline they MAKE you leave a message if they are too busy. My three messages must have been misplaced.All in all... BAD company and a bad expensive product."
5,"Jennifer and Leonard, A Perfect Pair","Jennifer Warnes and Leonard Cohen have hooked up to produce and record one of the best albums in recent memory. This CD features some of Cohens'best written songs sung by one of the most beautiful voices in popular music. From the rebelious ""First We Take Manhatten"" to the angelic ""Song For Bernadette"" to the heartfelt ""Ain't No Cure For Love"", every track evokes a powerful human emotion seldom heard on one record.Underated when it was first released, Jennifer Warnes' ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" is a MUST HAVE for anyone who appreciates music at it's best."
5,Bright Vocals and Dark Lyrics,"I found this outstanding CD in a store in Edinbough while traveling through Scotland in the late '80s. Perhaps the first shock is to hear Cohen's lyrics (so well-suited for his voice) sung so beautifully and passionately and so right by soprano Warnes. The vocals, instruments, arrangements, and production are all tight -- you can feel Warnes breath as she sings about love, lust, and loneliness. All the songs are winners, but ""Song of Bernadette"" belongs to Ms. Warnes. I'm a big fan of Leonard Cohen's books, poetry and music and this treatment of his songs by Warnes remains one of my favorite works. If you want to turn a friend onto Cohen, but are concerned that his voice (like Dylan's) may be too distracting for your friend (his or her loss), try this CD. Jennifer will win them over."
3,What the Hell?,No-one seems to have noticed that the stereo soundstage has been reversed on this re-mastering. Or were the original analogue tapes fed through the wrong way? Does anybody know? I prefer what I have been listening to for the last 20 years. This is disturbing.
5,"This one makes my ""A"" list","This recording has a high place my rotation list. Warnes has a pure sensuous voice and the sonics are superb, especially on a high-end system. Warnes sounds best on track 3, the title song, ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" Her clear pure voice comes through the recording and playback process with minimum distraction. I use this track often to evaluate the mid-range performance of my system."
5,A true work of art,"Beautiful.Jennifer Warnes sings like an angel, and her voice has never been put to better use than on these songs by Leonard Cohen. The highlight is ""Joan of Arc,"" a powerful, dramatic production that never fails to give me goose bumps.If I were to put together a list of the 10 greatest albums of all time, this album would definitely be included, maybe even in first place. This is a true work of art."
2,"I'm a big fan of Leonard Cohen, I have all his early","albums and some of his more recent ones. So when I saw the reviews on this collection plus the title (Famous Blue Raincoat is one of my favorites), I couldn't resist buying this album. But didn't like it at all.There is something Cohen's voice and the mood he projects that make his songs real. This artist (Jennifer Warnes) has a more 'normal' voice (possibly better) and mood, and (for me anyway) the songs don't come alive the way the originals do."
2,A weak cover album,"If you think you might like Leonard Cohen put to muzak, then this is the disc for you."
1,Total old fashioned sound,"Don't make the some mistake as me¡ I found the previews interesting and I'm a Cohen's fan, but this cd is too bad.Spend your money in other Cohen's stuffs."
5,Lovely Famous Blue Raincoat!,Today I purchased this CD from my local store. I didn't realise it had stopped being printed. What got me interested in Jennifer Warnes version of the song was last week I went on YouTube and saw a video version of this song that had her vocals alternating with Leonard's version to make an absolutly beautiful duet along with some lovely images. You can also see Joan of Arc with stunning visual done by the same Video artist.
5,"Finally! Thank you, Amazon!","It is wonderful to see this CD available. I am buying it tonight after recently purchasing my third casette tape because I literally wore out the first two. I especially love SONG OF BERNADETTE; it never fails to move me deeply: ""... so many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine, torn by what we've done and can't undo ..."" This is a wonderful album and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent, thought-provoking, and beautiful lyrics."
5,I love the voice of Jennifer Warnes,"I love the voice of Jennifer Warnes. She takes these songs by Leonard Cohen, and she makes these songs her own. ""First We Take Manhattan"" is my favorite cut. I love the guitar playing by the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan here. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" is a song that sounds like a love letter between two people who are apart from each other. I love the saxophone playing on this track. ""Song of Bernadette"" is a lovely track. The piano playing accompanies Jennifer's vocals well here. ""Aint No Cure For Love"" is a very pretty song with a romantic tone. ""Joan of Arc"" is an interesting song about the thoughts and feelings of this historic figure. I love the beat of this song very much. Jennifer Warnes sounds so melodic and crisp throughout this disc. I really enjoyed listening to this CD."
2,Leonard Cohen without passion,"I would not have thought that a soulless rendering of Leonard Cohen songs was even possible. This album is completely flat. I don't know Jennifer Warnes, but I'm a big fan of Leonard Cohen. I put this album on my reject pile after the first few listenings, and then pulled it out a few years later for another listen, and put it back. Now I'm listening again for the last time. There's just nothing here. Buy something else, anything else, involving Leonard Cohen for a peek at a wonderful songwriter. Other covers, such as Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, bring out the best in performers, but that is not the case (I hope and expect) here."
1,Awful recording,A terrible re-issue of a Jennifer Warnes classic. I owned the original which has gone missing so I bought this. There is no soundstage and the whole thing sounds like it was recorded through a portable cassette recorder. There are still versions of the original available from Australia. Do not buy this version.
3,Nostalgia,"When I bought the original cassette 20 years ago, I became a fan of Leonard Cohen songs. To hear the CD made me very nostalgic, so I follow it with a movie showing the 2005 Sidney concert celebrating his songs.I just hopped that the CD will include more extras."
3,Just an OK movie,"We were looking for a clean family movie and this did pass that test. However, it came across as a low-budget movie and some of the acting was not so great."
2,One of the Worst I've ever seen,"Sure it's a children's story, sure it has a nice message without being preachy, but my kids were bored. The acting was horrible, the pacing was ssslllooowww. The ending left even the kids saying, ""what? I thought it was supposed to be a mystery.""I don't know what a ""Dove"" is, or how this movie rated 5 of them, but it certainly doesn't rate more than two stars."
3,Literate folk-rock filled with interesting ideas and music,"This husband and wife team wears their influences on their sleeve - quite literally, on the CD sleeve. Books (Chekhov, Rilke) and records (Dylan, Beatles, Byrds) that inspired the words and music of their third LP can be found annotating each song's lyrics.Despite the tinge of intellectualism, the music is as warm and inviting as the oversized cups the Kennedys hold in nearly every photo. Their coffeehouse folk is rife with fluid melodies and chiming 12-string guitar, and their vocalizing takes inspiration from mid-60s duos like Ian & Silvia and Richard & Mimi Farina.Whether they're riffing on the writings of Vaclav Havel or Emily Dickinson, finding inspiration in the music of Gabriel Faure or Buffalo Springfield, picking at guitars, banjos and mandolins, or simply paying homage to New York radio legend Vin Scelsa, the result is superbly crafted, highly-literate and very memorable music."
4,"First rate folk-rock-pop, family style.","I did something I rarely do -- I ordered this disk without ever having heard a note of the Kennedy's music. But I had read warm comments and reviews, and also an interview in which I was impressed with the seriousness with which they approached their work, and also their warmth and wit. I'm pleased to say the gamble brought me as welcome a surprise as any disk I've bought this year. The Kennedys offer a delightful mix of original and traditional acoustic folk with a scattering of other styles. Their writing is not particularly deep or insightful, but it is idealistic, polished, and uplifting. Maura Kennedy has a lovely sweet soprano I could listen to all day, and Pete Kennedy's virtuosic picking on a variety of fretted instruments anchors busy, well constructed arrangements that always seem just right. This is as joyous, positive, and enjoyable a record as you'll hear this year. Not to be missed!"
5,this album's excellent!,"Tracks 4 and 9 are the best. I say it's a combination of Loreena McKennet, Crosby,Stills,Nash and Young, and Gillian Welsh. Folk? Rock? I don't know but it's a good find. So what if it's not ""deep"" or ""insightful""."
4,Hauntingly beatiful,"I normally am not a folk-rock fan, but I was able to hear the contents of this CD before I purchased it, and once I bought it, I couldn't quit playing it. The arrangements seem to be sparse and understated but the overall effect is simply genuine and beautiful. My favorites are tracks 4, 7, and 9. I find those three songs playing within my head over and over."
4,"A new voice, with much thought and angelic notes","The Kennedy duo shares a new light on thinking about life and those who have gone before. The excellent voice of Mura with vibrant guitar work by Peter have given us a new voice to share the future with.The listner must hear the ""music"" several times to appreciate the color and depth of the emotions shared."
3,"Good overall picture, but incorrect","Gilmore, in his book the death of contract, while he does provide an overall view of the different doctrines of contract, which are useable for any Law student, and indeed recommended, does not in fact provide a correct one. It is the belief, at least this side of the Atlantic, that other writers on this subject have provided works which better understand the doctrines underlying the Law of Contract. While no doubt Atiyah would agree with the author of this book, that is by no means a basis for believing such a view. Nevertheless, well worth reading, in order to present the student with a fuller grasp of the ideas behind Contract."
5,Excellent video of ALL I have seen,"I was told to see this video and it's better than any thing I've seen (I don't know what that 'neallatino' review is talking about. I already have the other videos he reviewed, and he is CRAZY if he doesn't think this is the best one-- if he really dances salsa). The ones he says are good, are the worst quality and I can't hardly hear the teachers talk.This video here has 8 steps, but they put like 4 different moves in each step, for men and women, so it's more like 20-30 steps. And i think when the teachers put background scenes w/ their students and the teachers talking & goofing around in the video, it makes it a lot more interesting to watch because regular videos get boring! I watched this many times and I love it. I'm an intermediate dancer but i'm going to buy their beginner DVD because this is seriously better then any videos or classes i've reviewed."
3,Average,"There's not much to say here. Average NY salsa on 2 moves for beginners. Nothing spectacular, nothing very sexy, nothing I haven't seen before at the NY socials. Needless to say, I'm a little disappointed because I bought this video looking to learn hot & sexy salsa moves and styling. I didn't see none of that, just a bunch of turn patterns. It's good for beginners who are looking to learn new turn patterns though."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,Im an old school REAL SALSA DANCER and I purchased this DVD to see all the crazy new things that these crazy people are doing.But in doing so I saw the horrible dancing that these San Fransisco/N.Y/Casino people do! This type of dancing for starters is for show... and that being said it takes away the essence of the dancing spirit.I dance the old school Puerto Rican way and I will never trade it for the world REAL SALSA. If you wanna look like a robot and a total ass of yourself go ahead and watch this video... if you want to dance go learn from any of my hispanic brothers and sisters well be more than happy than to teach you.
5,hot...hot...hot,Woo this DVD is hot!!! Sam and I dance everyday. We play our favorite Latin song and spend sometime doing out lil moves and turns. We are a huge fan of salsa...we met in a salsa club 2 years back and that's how our romance started. Both Sam and I couldn't continue with our salsa classes for some reasons which was a big big pain for us. He heard about this DVD from friend and he got one for me. I went totally crazy watching the videos and couldn't help myself from dancing. I just love the music and the instructions are way too good. It should be awarded for the best DVD...it's not only for the intermediates but should work for the beginners too coz it's so simple to follow and they explain everything step by step which is not a problem to understand. We go clubbing every weekends and we stand out!!!
2,I am not even sure it is an instructional video.,If anyone is impressed by this video they have never seen a decent Salsa instructional video.With only 8 routines in the video it is certainly not good value for the money.Over half the video is self promotion for the Salsa teachers.I mean I really do not care if their students think they are great or how well Raul plays the piano ( he does not ).Over half the video is a waste of time.The fact that they call themselves the salsa world's top instructors should give you a clue.This is an intermediate level video with nothing new. Just the most common moves that have been around for years.I feel I wasted my money buying it.There are a lot better Salsa videos being sold on Amazon.
5,Great Video,"I just started salsa this yr. and I got to tell you, I can do these moves shown on this video only because the way they explaine it. Very easy to fallow.One thing about the video,I think it could have been a little longer, maybe at the end before the dance they could have thrown a little solo steps for men and women you don't see that alot. This is a very nice video my wife and I love it. Thanks Raul & Tani great job.(saludos from Vineland NJ)"

FOR LOVERS ONLY is also one of a kind in it's fresh approach to intimacy in marriage. The authors seem down to earth and real as they speak of the struggles and difficulties of marriage. After reading FOR LOVERS ONLY you will be convinced that the sky is the limit for communication, closeness and friendship in your marriage."
1,OVER INDULGENT!,"Charles Webb can write brilliant amusing novels but this isn't one of them. The characters are nauseating and Webb's over descriptive way with words is irritating. He takes two pages to describe in minute details the lead character locking up his office which could of been dealt with in a paragraph. This is par for course throughout this dull, dull novel. There really isn't much of a story. The only good thing is it is thankfully short."
4,Its a fan...,"It works for what I want. Its small and fits on my desk well. On low it makes hardly any noise. On high it sounds like any other fan would. Its made of cheap plastic, but as long as it works, thats all that really matters."
4,"Quiet, perfect for office use","I keep this fan at my desk at work, and I think it is perfect for that. The Low setting is practically silent (similar noise to some CPU fans). It doesn't move a ton of air at this setting, but it is definitely sufficient for an office where we have AC anyway. My one complaint would be that the High setting is significantly louder, so I keep mine on Low all the time."
5,~~~~~Perfect desktop size fan with a cool breeze~~~~~,This cool little fan is well worth the price & it will fit perfectly on the corner of my desk at work. This fan is SUPER quiet on the low setting & quiet on the high setting. Looking forward to keeping cool at work in the summer months!
2,Not quiet enough for office...,"I bought this fan for my cubicle at work after reading several reviews stating it is very quiet. Perhaps mine is defective but it is NOT quiet: it develops an annoying clicking sound after about 30 minutes of operation. Also, it's a bit clunky for desktop use as it takes up 8-10"" of cubic space. It does have 2 speeds and the high setting does produce strong airflow but directional options are limited and - again - it's simply too loud for an office setting where others are around. I wish I had returned it before my 30 days were up! It has been relocated to my husband's shop while I look for a replacement."
4,Good but watch out....,"I began using this product to increase my breastmilk supply when I went back to work. It actually worked by itself with me without the Fenugreek. The only issues I had was this was it cleans you out a little bit too much. When I got it in the mail it read ""Digestive Tonic"" on the label and I disregarded it. Bad move. It wasn't so bad in the beginning because it helped me get over my constipation that I still suffered from due to pregnancy, but after about a month it gave me loose bowels. I know TMI but I wished someone would have warned me about that aspect before I began using it. But besides that it's a great product that actually works."
1,not effective,had lots of trouble with supply and tried everything including this. waste of time and totally ineffective.
3,I didn't really see any benefit,"I gave this 3 stars because maybe it helped some, but I recommend trying reglan it definitely works, but you need a prescription and it may have side effects. I personally only experienced excessive tiredness so I just limited myself to taking it at night before bed and by the middle of the night I was ready to feed and the one would last through the next day. It is not a long term use medication and when you don't take it for about a week you know it. This review has turned into a pitch for reglan instead of a review for this, but I wouldn't buy this again."
3,Didnt notice any improvement,"This product was recommended by my baby's pediatrician, but I really didnt notice any improvement in milk production. From what was communicated to me is thatmit works for some people but not others. I gave this product 3 stars because the quality was up to my expectations, but it just didnt work for my body."
2,Didn't work,"If you're taking this to increase breast milk supply, stick to fenugreek or domperidone. I didn't think this product made much of a difference."
2,didn't notice a difference in milk production,I didn't notice a difference in milk production. I went through two bottles with fenugreek and I did not have any noticeable difference.
1,I Didn't want to give it a 1 star but I have to,"It brought it up from like nothing to something but like hardly nothing, i've been trying it for a week I wish it was a little better, I wish it worked but I've been taking it and I can maybe get an ounce or two a day, a day!! Sorry but it doesn't work for me, wish it did :C"
3,Didn't work for me,"I have nothing bad to say about this product, it just didn't work for me. I've read other comments before I purchased this and read that it helped others produce more milk and that it worked in a short amount of time. Well, I took all 100 pills and nothing. Now I'm working on the Mother's Milk Tea, testing this item. If this doesn't work I'm giving up. I only have about a month to go anyways, before I stop breast feeding my daughter."
4,Great for boosting Milk Production!,"I purchased Blessed Thistle to use with my Fenugreek in order to help boost my milk supply. I definitely see an improvement in my supply when I take this with my Fenugreek, and the times when I run out, I definitely see a dip in my supply! It is worth a shot adding this when you take Fenugreek if you are having trouble producing enough milk while breastfeeding or pumping. This allows me to pump 30 ounces a day, while also nursing a toddler! I highly recommend it!"
3,Not Sure What To Think,I purchased this upon the advise of a lactation specialist as well as reading the reviews here on Amazon. Im not sure if this is doing anything different than what I am already producing. I take Blessed thistle as well as Fenugreek...which the Fenugreek didn't seem to do much on its own either. My daughter is now 9 months and now has three teeth...I would like to try to continue (if I can without being bitten) breastfeeding unitl she turns 1 years old.There were times when I could get 4 or 5 oz by pumping but that was not consistent. Also I still have to supplement because its like she is either not getting it fast enough or I am not producing enough for her liking. Either way like anything else our body chemistries are different so what might not be much for me may be perfect for you. Can't hurt to give it a try.
4,Single link not dual link,"When I ordered this I thought it was dual link, from the picture, but it is a single link. But it works just fine, for the price its worth it. Both my analog n digital channels work excellent, but in reality single link works just as good as dual link. I got my order within a few days and its gold plated, great investment compared to retail price."
1,Description not comprehensive,"The description online did not indicate the the wand would ONLY work in conjunction with the stuffed animals and could not be used on its own. Don't purchase unless you want to get all the stuffed animals, too."
5,A Great Video,"This video continues the great tradition of the anime series called 'Gundam Wing.' With great action, twisting plot, developed characters, and the new Gundam Wing 0, it surpasses all expectations. I highly recommend it."
2,Its a pity book.,"This is a book about self-pity. I got annoyed after I read half of the book. I thought I was going to read this inspiring story about a woman. Instead I'm reading a whiney ""oh pity me please!"" novel. There are many others out there that face far worse then what Sue did, and their attitude was far better. Sue should be thankful that she is still alive. Just because someone didn't run to your every demand immediately does not make them bad medical professionals. This is a very one-sided book, which bashes nursing in my opinion. They are so under appreciated and they work their butts off to keep patients alive."
4,I liked this book and recomended to other people.,"My mom was recently diagnosed with Guillian Barre Syndrome, so this book was recommended to me. It was almost like my mother wrote the book! Very scary disease. This book was very informative and gave me some wonderful ideas of things to help mom a little."
4,Informative and enjoyable,Great insight into Guillain Barre syndrome. Excellent read for anyone who may be in a position to care for a person affected by the disorder.
3,Mostly about her personal life not GBS...,Thia book was not what I expected. I have GBS and was looking for a book about it...there are so few. This book was more about her personal life than GBS...don't waste your money if you want to learn more about GBS.
5,Beautiful and strong enough,"The piece is like described. I have used it for about 6 weeks, even at the swiming pool and beach, and it keeps same original aspect and brightness. Price was good and delivery super fast."
4,Information every teen should know!,"I use this video as part of the curriculum for my middle school Teen Skills class. The format is both informative and fun! The kids are always so surprised by what they do and do not know.This should be required viewing for every teen! There is a lot of material, and it goes by quickly. You will need more than one viewing."
5,WiFlyer is absolutely Slick!,"After hooking up WiFi for a DSL network, I expected the WiFlyer set-up to take a while. But when I opened the box, I saw that the quick start-up intructions were easy to follow. I plugged everything in as described and went back to the instructions to see how to open or launch a connection. When I looked back at the unit, it was already showing a connection on the indicator lights. Still skeptical about dialing up the ISP, I launched Internet Explorer. Instead of going to my home page, it went to a WiFlyer screen asking for the typical dial-up info, such as ISP phone number, user name and password. Once it connected, my home page displayed. On subsequent launches, the WiFlyer screen remembered (by cookie) the phone number and user name. There can't possibly be a better way to provide WiFi for a dial-up connection."
2,good idea,"It is a great idea if the product worked. The problem is, it doesn't. There is virtually no customer support. It took a very long time to get in contact with anyone at the company who would listen to my complaints. They finally replaced the original defective product which had issue with the wireless feature and did not broadcast a signal. The replacement works better, but constantly drops out and has to be rebooted about once per hour. When this happens all information (passwords, dial-up number, etc.) has to be input again. I can't get anyone at the company to listen to my complaints and do anything about it. They say they will send a replacement or refund, but they don't."
1,The company that produces this product is out of business [...],"This product is worthless, Amazon should not sell it otherwise is loosing credability on its selling products.I need to return it but I don't have the proper address. Amazon: help me with your correct address for me to return it and receive my money back, thanks**I had received the sale-representative evaluation, I didn't answer because he is not at fault, the management should know better the products they offer, just entering the prodigywiflyer...and will found out, too bad..."
1,Wiflyer...$$$$ flew out window.Worked for about 2 months then quit.,Wiflyer...Something flew but it was not the wiflyer. worked for about 2 months then quit. found info on line for factory reset...that did not work. Light on but nobody home. 50 bucks out the window. would not buy again do not recommend. am looking for other options for dial-up network.
3,POTENTIALLY,THIS DID NOT WORK AND HAS TO BE REPLACED. BOUGHT FOR MY NIECE BECAUSE LOVE MY OWN WHICH I'VE HAD FOR YEARS NOW. IT WORKS SO WELL AND ELIAS IN TECH IS SO KIND AND HELPFUL IN HELPING TO SET UP AND HAVE A REPLACEMENT SENT IF NEED BE.SMALL AND ATTRACTIVE AND EASILY TRANSPORTED ON THE JOURNEY.
3,Company gone belly-up?,"It would appear that Always On Wireless has gone belly-up. Nevertheless, if you are in need of a wifi to dialup connection, I can recommend this device, if you can find one, with a couple of reservations. The first reservation is, of course, you won't get any customer service from a company that no longer exists. The second reservation is that this device provides no way to store a backup of its settings. I've had a few occasions when the device lost all its settings, and the only way to retrieve them was from screen-dumps of the several setup pages. There are lots of settings that can be tweaked, but most users will probably leave most of them at the default. Reentering the settings by hand is a minor annoyance, but goes quickly, and is not a deal-breaker."
1,product didn't have a good range,"The product was hooked up in a bedroom and wouldn't pick up signal in living room. I sent it back, with no hassle at all."
4,wiflyer,This is a nice option if you can't get a high speed connection. I use mine with my laptop at home which allows to to be online and not attached to the phone line to the wall. The range is decent enough as long I don't go to a different floor of the house. Set up took about five minutes and I have had no problems since set up. Once set up and plugged in you just hit the dial button and wait about 30 seconds to connect and my laptop automatically detects the connection with the wifi card. Until I can get something other than dial up at home this has been a good option and since the price has recently dropped it is pretty affordable.
1,constantly loses connection,router was very easy to configure and connected pretty fast but lost the connection every 10-15 minutes.according to their chart compatiable with people pc which i have.tried to reach support by email 3-4 times all was return to sender tried ph# mail box always full. have sent back to vender and will try another one. hope it works out the box as there is no support with this company.
2,Wiflyer,"Wiflyer is an innovative product and tried to do what it was designed to do. Unfortunately, it played havoc with my computer. After a couple weeks of trying different things, I gave up & asked for return authorization. I loved the freedom of not being tied to the phone line. I am so disappointed!!"
1,Not as advertised,"The Wiflyer doesn't work with pocket PC as they desribed in the advertise, doesn't work with Net Zero, Juno or any of those Free internet access providers. The signal is so weak that it makes the surfing the net so slow. After the Wiflyer connected to the internet it could take forever to be able to go to the websites. I really regreted that I bought one."
3,"Nice, but won't work for everybody.","If you are going to buy the WiFlyer then you should know this:""The following are the only known incompatible ISPs:CompuserveAT&T; GlobalNetRoadrunner dial-upWalmart Connect""This comes from the Always On web site, and could prevent a lot of confusion for customers. Always On has no way of making their product work with these ISPs and will normally not even respond to questions about them.Never-the-less, it seems like a great product, if you have the right ISP. I had no problems communicating with it as soon as I plugged it in. But after several hours of tweaking, I found out it wouldn't work with my ISP. I wish I knew that before I ordered it!"
4,The WiFlyer is good,"The WiFlyer works very well, I am able to wirelessly use my dialup connection to the internet from anywhere in the house. I think its priced a little high but it's the only one of its kind that I have found."
3,"Simple, easy to set-up but .....","Wiflyer worked as advertised. Had to enter my ISP manually - not in lists included - but that is a straight forward operation.Amazon pages imply the Hawking Technology Hi-Gain 6dB Omni-Directional Wireless Antenna (HAI6SIP) can be added for increased range. DOES NOT WORK. Wiflyer comes with MPX connector, Hawking uses SMA. Have to find an adapter or break warranty and change the connector.Small nuisance: Connection with PDA (HP IPAQ) is forced to the connection screen. Management pages load but redirection is too soon to use. You have to use PC or laptop to limit MACs, set WEP, rename node, etc."
5,Finally - something for the road warrior and country dweller,"Finally! Somebody has made a tech toy that we road warrior and country dwellers have needed for some time. I live miles from any high speed service (short of satellite) and also travel quite a bit for business. So many hotels design the room with the phone by the bed but the desk is on the other side of the room. Now, with WiFlyer, I can enjoy wireless internet via my dialup ISP while at home, and high speed or dialup access while on the road. The best part of the whole deal was that it worked right out of the box! Now, if WiFlyer could get me high speed access out here in rural Missouri..."
2,SOME GOOD ROCK'N ROLL!,"Larry Williams was Lloyd Price's valet. He recorded a lot of music for SPECIALTY in the late 50's. This cd contains his hits...""Short Fat Fannie"", Bony Moronie"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" and ""Slow Down"" were his best...The rest is good 50's rock'n roll that was typical for SPECIALTY in the late 50's...I suggest this one only if you are a real collector of Classic 50's R&B and R&R."
4,"Works well, but may need additional padding inside to guarantee locking","This works well, but if your door handles are thin, you may need to add some additional padding to make sure this springs back to the locked position. I taped some cardboard around some of our very thin ""elegant"" door handles to make this fit better. Note that some reviews elsewhere state that installing this on one side of your door could lock you out from the other side. That is flat out wrong, regardless of what type of handle or button is on the other side of the door.I used screws -- I wouldn't count on double-sided tape to protect my child. If you had to use tape, then I would try the kind that comes with the 3M removable hangars. It is very strong and removes without damaging surfaces."
1,Does not work!,"I bought 2 of these locks and they worked well for about a month. I think they were a deterrent and my 18 month old daughter thought she could no longer open the door so she didn't try. We didn't want to put holes in our doors so we used the adhesive mount. Well, my daughter has now realized that if she just pulls hard enough on the handle, the lock rips off the door and she can open it. The adhesive is not strong enough to withstand a determined toddler's tugs."
3,Not so great with smart toddlers,This lever lock would be great if you didn't have a sneaky 3 year old to figure out how to open it. We used it on our front door to keep our toddler from going outside but it is not working all the time.
1,Check your handles before buying,We bought these locks for our front and back doors. We have Schlage lever handles (like you get at Lowe's or Home Depot) and these did not fit the handles at all. Make sure you see what kind of handle you have prior to buying these.
4,It worked,"A little flimsy, but it does the job.. I live in an apartment and didn't want to drill into the door. The Kidco Lever lock allowed me to have a child lock on the front door without having to drill holes."
1,Poor Construction,We ordered this lever childproof lock in anticipation of switching our 22 month old to a toddler bed. We installed it and the handle piece that clips over the compartment that covers the lever did not stay on well. Our 22 month old was able to open the door with no trouble at all. I would not recommend this product.
4,Great product...very easy to install,"I am not handy, but this was easy even for me to install! Took about 2-3 minutes per door. The locking mechanism sometimes slips off the track when you open the door (which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) but it is a very minor inconvenience and can easily be put back on track. Overall, very solid product and our little one hasn't cracked the code (yet)."
4,"Purchased at Amazon, a product that works,","This product works well and a toddler cannot open the door. The only fallback is that it requires both hands of the adult to be available in order to open the door. One hand to lift up the top portion and the other had to turn the lever door handle. So, if you want to put something in a pantry for instance, you can't have it in your hands and just open the door. You have to set the item down, first."
2,does not work on all levers,"This lock did not fit on our front or back door levers. It only fit on the smaller levers we have on some of the bedroom doors. It worked well for the bedroom door, but we really need something that will fit on a slightly larger lever for a main door. At this point we are going to buy hook and eye locks until we can find something better."
3,Not for a smart child,"I purchased these for our outside doors, hoping my 2 1/2 year couldn't figure them out. Well he was able to figure it out. Before he figured out how it worked he was able to muscle it open. The design is clever and functionable. However my son was able to figure it out. So I will have to try another door lever lock and see if that one works."
2,bad quality,these are not very good...we bought two and only used one as the product was cheaply made and did not work all that great
1,Waste of 10 bucks!,Ordered this to try to keep my two year old from getting outside on the street side of our house. She figured out how to open it in about 2 minutes. Very chintzy and not worth the 10 dollars.
3,3 year old defeated it in 30 secs,"Wow, what a disappointment. As the title says, our 3 year old granddaughter defeated this mechanism in 30 seconds the first time trying. It went on easily enough and she didn't have to break it either. she simply looked at it and figured it out. I was shocked at how easy it was to unlock, and apparently the 3 year was as well. Either this is made for a much younger child or we have a future magician in the making.I give three stars for the quality and installation process.Randy"
1,Will Ruin Doors :(,"I bought this thinking that you do not have to screw anything or stick anything onto your doors. I was wrong. Who wants to put screw holes into their doors? And, who would want to risk puting up adhesive and then tearing it off when you are finished with it? If you don't care about these things, then this is probably a great lock. But, I care about the appearance of my doors that will be seen long after I don't need these locks anymore! -My quest continues for a lever lock...!"
2,23 month old figured it out in six weeks,"Our 23 month old figured out how to use this latch in under two months. He basically lifted the top tab and while leaning on the handle, ""presto"" got the door open and was very pleased with his discovery.In order to secure the top tab, you must apply an adhesive that comes with the lock and screw holes are optional for additional security. We opted to secure the top tab with the screws to be extra safe.After only 6 weeks use, we were left with messy adhesive and two holes in our door. I would not recommend this product."
2,Doesn't work as well as other child locks,It took our 3 yr old all of 5 minutes to figure out all she had to do was hang on the door knob until the child lock let loose.
1,Not good,"My 22 month old son was able to figure this product out in about one day. Essentially, this security device is just too easy to open. I waisted my money on this one. I had to end up putting a chain lock on the door."
1,"Beware, Not for ALL Lever Doors","Beware, this lever door lock is not for all door types with levers. If you have a multi-point locking door which requires that the lever be pulled up to shoot the multi-point deadbolts, then this lever door lock will not work for you. This door lock works to prevent the lever from being pulled down in the traditional fashion in which levers open doors, however, it cannot be used if the lever also must be pulled up to engage multi-point bolts. This product did not work on our French doors which are impact resistant and have multi-point locks."
5,It has worked for me,"This was simple to install, about 3 minutes, and it has worked for my 2 year old. Now he stays in his room for naps even if the lock is not set. This saved my sanity!"
2,Didn't stop my son from opening the door,"My 3 year old took all of about 2 minutes to figure these locks out. They worked OK for the 18 month old. We are now replacing our doorknobs with round ones, since the round knob covers work much better for our family."
1,Unhappy with product,Ordered these a few months back. Now my LO is 6 months old and am in the process of baby proofing. My husband and I both spent way too long trying to open the thing just to install it with no success. It is definitely not easy to install! I would like to return them and now am only looking at getting a partial refund. Very disappointed!
2,"Good Idea, but not Idea","Around an hour after installing this product I put my 17 month old to the test and it took him less than a minute to open the door. This was using the adhesive that comes with it. I'm sure that if the screws were used it would be fine until the toddler is old enough to figure out the switch. The screws would visibly damage the door, so I am more happy with the catching latch I bought which installs with a alan wrench and doesn't damage it."
5,Works well for our son,"We are using this on the dog room so that when the dogs are in their room, our little one doesn't go in there to bother them (it is their own piece of heaven/quiet)There was no problem installing it, we actually drilled it in.It haven't fallen off and fit on the handle just fine.It doesn't auto lock so if we want the handle to lock properly we have to spent a split second making sure it is set correctly.So far our 1.5 y.o. who can open all the other door knobs and levers hasn't figured this one out."
1,Wrong product for my needs,I purchased this for the door of my daycare. The handle on our door is a commercial handle with an exterior key pad. I purchased this Kidco type because it appeared to be the best one I could find for a lever lock. This door lever lock's handle was too short for the handle on the door. We were able to cut the plastic a bit so we could put it on. It worked for a while but the the top part of this lock wouldn't stay stuck to the door and kept flying off. It would probably be okay to use on a household door that doesn't get opened often.
3,Just OK,"I bought this to keep my cat from opening the door to the study after she mastered the art. It does the job of keeping her out, but it is awkward to operate and has a poor quality feel. The comment others have made about it needing more padding is very true."
3,Didn't work for my needs....,"I can see where this lock would work great for kids, but I needed it to keep a very large dog in a particular room & he body slams it & gets it open. Frustrating! Just didn't work out for me."
1,Not worth the money,The lock worked for a couple of months until my almost 2 year old figured it out. Not only that but it wasn't a tight fit on the door so I was constantly having to snap it back into place to make sure it was actually locked. It just wasn't a snug fit. I used all the padding but it still wiggles a lot. Now I have 2 extra of these in packages. I guess I'll try to send it back.
1,My kids broke them all off,"These were recommended by my pediatrician. My kids figured them out, broke them off the doors and I still have double sided stickies all over the house. Didn't work for us and my kids still over run the boundaries...however...now they are old enough to recognize natural consequences and parent administered consequences."
1,not a good purchase,sloppy fit on the door handle even with the foam folded in half. handle case kept coming apart in my two year old's hand. wouldn't latch properly with the safety latch.
1,Came off!,"I gave this door lock a try, since my 2 yr old was starting to open the front door. It did not work at all! First, every time you try to unlock it, you had to push it in and then press the release button, since the foam inside the box was not dense enough to keep the door handle secure. Also, it came off after only a week of use. Do not recommend this to anyone."
2,"Poor design, cheap and doesn't lock well",I am very disappointed in this lock. It's made out of flimsy plastic and it's very easy for a two-year-old to snap apart and use the door handle.
1,Lasted 1 day or less,"This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so. As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off. You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door. It just isn't going to hold up.It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money."
1,Did not fit,These did not fit on our lever door handles - at all! Now they are completely useless to us. :(
3,Not as bad as other reviewers indicated,"I bought this despite some bad reviews that said the lock wouldn't stay attached to the door without screws. Since the door in my case is a hollow-core door, I was worried about that, but I've found that it has stayed on there just fine. Perhaps the key is cleaning the door beforehand with a little alcohol, so the double-sided tape sticks? In use, I've found that it didn't really comes with enough foam in the handle to fit tightly onto the door handle, but if you remember to check that it snaps back into place, it's fine. My son hadn't been able to open the door since we put it on, which is a huge help."
1,Save your money,"My 17 month old hasn't figured it out yet, but my three year old defeated it on the second day. Good quality and easy to install (no tools needed) but way too easy to use and won't prevent a bright, determined kid from entering/leaving a room for long. Would work well if you're trying to keep a dog or cat from using the door handle."
2,Flimsy,"The door handle piece is very loose and flimsy. I give my son a few weeks before he is able to get past this device. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any safety devices that work for this type of door handle."
2,Parts of this textbook are very unclearly written.,"This is a textbook meant for students of English as a Second Language. I found parts of itdifficult or even impossible to understand myself, and English is my primary language.I can't recommend it."
5,Take a trip back in time with Laura Ingalls,"I am a huge fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder. My children & I love reading about her life. We found the Little House songbook a few years ago, & absolutely love it! It is a gentle, uplifting tape of Laura's favorite songs. The music is wonderful. As we listen to the tape & look through the book, we can just picture the Ingalls family sitting by the fire, singing songs as Pa played his fiddle. It gives us a cozy warm feeling. I highly reccomend this book to anyone w/small children."
5,Great Hex Key,Its good quality and the metric is super helpful with all those jobs that a Standard Hex Key wont quite fit. Was delivered in plenty of time for the holidays. Overall it's a great product!
2,Buyer BEWARE!!!,"I bought this thinking that I would hear the Original Cast recordings of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. This is a remake of all of his music. I bought it about 2 years ago and only listened to it once. It does say on the back that it is performed by the Orlando Pops Orchestra, so I guess I should have read that. So if your looking for music from the original play, do not get this."
3,Bought it for the tin,I have two easy pass toll pass units in my car. One is for work and the other is personal. I bought this for the tin case that holds the CDs. It works perfectly to shield the easy pass units from getting tagged by the RFID readers. I never listened to the CDs.
3,Pretty Shoe,"I bought this shoe because it just looked so pretty. I ordered a half a size too big but i am going to wear the shoe nonetheless. it really looks great with a summer dress. i would actually like to get the shoes in a different colour. But its a great shoe, very comfortable and because i live in South Africa so we have great summers for this type of shoe."
2,Thirteenth Floor Elevators - 'Out Of Order:Live At The Avalon Ballroom' (Magnum),"More or less,another cheesy compilation of half live tracks(most likely faked)and half studio out-takes,album left overs,etc.Don't get me wrong,this CD isn't all bad.There are some decent cuts here for your listening pleasure.Some TFE originals,like ""Splash 1"",""Roller Coaster"" and ""Fire Engine"",not to mention some okay done covers such as The Kink's ""You Really Got Me"" and Chuck Berry's ""Roll Over Beethoven"".If you wish to check out their 'best ever' live lp,that's for real(not faked),check out 'Levitation'(see my review).'Out Of Order...' is strictly for die hards only."
3,Nice for mp3 songs but locks up using Audible book format,"This unit is a nice mp3 player. I bought it though to use it for audio books from audible.com. I have no problem with using this for music but if I download an audio book it locks up. I called RCA for assistance with this. Their response was that I need a firmware upgrade. The problem is that there is not firmware upgrade available. Of course I did ask when would be availabe and the reply was, we don't know. I am returning this unit since RCA has no idea when a firmware update will be made avaiable. Another problem was that I bought it from jlhwholesalers.com even after I read a notice that their communication with customers was bad. Well of course it's been a week and 4 emails to them and I still am unable to return my unit. jlhwholesalers keeps telling me that they are waiting for a return authorization from a vendor. I should have stuck with Amazon but they were out of stock."
1,Look somewhere else,"Got this for my wife as a gift because she loves to work out with her mp3 player. Control stick was hard to use; rarely the direction you move it was the direction shown. HR monitor was completely off, showed a resting HR of ~160 BPM for a healthy adult. Would not recommend this product to anyone looking to for an mp3 player to work out with. Try the Zen Nano Plus or Sandisk players. They have armbands and are much easier to use, especially when running."
3,"Great Music, BAD BAD BAD for AUDIBLE","I bought this unit to use at the gym for music, the FM for the TV's, and the ability to use Audible files.Music, FM...they work great. HOWEVER...when selecting an Audible file, the unit LOCKS UP! Solid, dead...see ya.I spoke with RCA and they told me: ""Yes, there's a problem...and right now we don't have a fix.""Oh well...Audible gave me an iPOD shuffle with my membership...guess I'll use that!"
1,Not relevant to Test 933 USPS,"This book had lots of good content, the only problem is that none of it applies to the test. Test 933 for the USPS doesn't include 99% of the information covered in this book.Study algebra, Analog electronics, digital electronics, and blueprints (technical drawings), and you will ace the test. That is of course, if you have some practical hands-on knowledge of tools for general maintenance work.There are only 2 or 3 questions related to the blueprint."
1,maintenance mechanic,this review manual did little to prepare me for the real maintenance mechanic exam put on by the usps. it gave me a false sense of preparedness.
1,Worst Fruit Slices I have ever tasted!,"I was really hopeful when I ordered these Fruit Slices. It had been a long time since I had eaten any Fruit Slices, and was hoping to spark a delicious memory from my childhoood! BUT, I was so disappointed when I ate my first slice - yes, I ate the entire piece, HOPING that the flavor would get better, but alas, the flavor did not improve. The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit. I took one bite tastes of the other flavors, and couldn't tell much difference in any of the flavors, other than a bitter, sour fruit taste. So - save your money, and look for a different brand of fruit slices to buy!"
1,This is really bad,"This is really bad, I should have trusted the other reviewers. The taste is the worst I have tried so far. It is bitter without any fruit or tarty flavor. The slices are also not uniform and some of them are just pieces."
1,cheap bulk pack- major disappointment,"i love these, but what you order here is not fresh-i always get these individually wrapped, sugary, ecthis looks like someone grabbed a few and threw it into a bag and shipped itfor the amount sent, and the quality- i would not buy again from this placedid i mention half the bag was orange. there was not watermelon which is the best. there were manly lemons and oranges- the flavors nobody want.major disappointment"
5,Better than Sweet Factory,"Was tired of going to Sweet Factory for fruit slice candy so we ordered these. They're juicier than the original, but not quite as sugary. Depending on how you like your candy fruit slices this will obviously be a pro/con. For us, win win. A+."
1,Order Was Cancelled,"Ordered through Amazon and supplier could not produce. Amazon canceled order, supplier never contacted me."
1,Rip Off,"I bought this product in the plastic tray format, and when I got home and opened the package I was in for a suprise. Not only was the product no where near as good as I remembered it to be, but it had a 3"" by 4"" label smack dab in the middle of the front. When I opened it, yup, no candy underneath the label. Talk about 'false advertising'. Will never buy these again just on principle. This company evidently doesn't care about a loyal following. Fool me once..."
3,"Tasty, but not the best","These fruit slices were tasty enough, I guess, but not the most flavorful and not the freshest I have ever gotten."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this kit in June as a birthday gift. We were really looking forward to a great summer of discovery. However, the Insect Lore ad DOES NOT state that the larve cannot be shipped in the Summer to hotter parts of the US. There seems to be no provision to protect the larve with packaging for summer delivery to the Southwest. Looks like most positive reviews are from buyers who live in a cooler climate."
4,Nice Educational Item.,"My 4.5 yr old saw it on TV and kept asking for it.If comes with a mail in certificate of the caterpillars, however you can also redeem the certificate code on their website to avoid the certificate mailing delay.I received 10 caterpillars and 8 matured into butterflies."
5,Amazing!,"I was a skeptic- but I LOVE this toy. I bought it for my 5 year old and the children in my daycare (ages2-5). The caterpillars arrived in about 1 1/2 weeks and every one of them turned into a butterfly! We have been feeding them sugar water per the instructions and they have lived over four weeks! Great product. Would be fine at Christmas, the sugar water works great to keep them indoors! EXCELLENT product- and I am picky!"
5,Great for children to learn,"This caterpillar/butterfly set was a lot of fun. It allowed my 6 year old to understand the life cycle of a caterpillar changing to a butterfly. The only problem, (which isn't a big deal) is that the caterpillar would transform to a butterfly overnight when we were sleeping, so we were unable to see that process. But we are already ordering more caterpillars because our family had lots of fun with it."
5,Butterfly pavilion,"HUGE, and perfect if you need to put in a plant that the caterpillars are enjoying eating so you can watch them grow and turn into a butterfly. Top opens up and it's so easy to get in and out of this pavilion. My girls love it, now they are housing a ton of ladybugs so it's got a whole bunch of possibilities :)"
3,"Fun and educational, but long wait for caterpillars.","The Butterfly Pavilion is a really fun and educational item, but you do not receive the caterpillars with the pavilion. When you get the pavilion you have to send in $5 extra to get the caterpillars. After sending in the money we waited 3 weeks and then they finally came. I was disappointed because you would think the price for the caterpillars would be included in the 24.99 with the pavilion. My daughter asked me everyday where the caterpillars were when we checked the mail. I tried calling costumer service many times only I never got to talk to a person after waiting in hold for over 20 minutes several different times. I even left a message after picking an extension and never received a call back. If I would have know this now I would have ordered the more expensive one from the TV. At least that one comes with the caterpillars at the same time. The one we got also does not come with the DVD and poster that the other one comes with."
4,My kid is happy playing it!!!,This was really good in entertaining my two kids they really love playing it daily they learn a lot from home... it adds more educational values and keep them interesting .They enjoy a lot!!!Good one!!Insect Lore Live Butterfly Pavillion
1,Unfulfilled expectations,"We purchased the Butterfly Pavillion this summer and my boys were really excited to watch the metamorphosis. There is a great instruction and fact booklet with the kit. We ordered our caterpillars through the mail so that they would arrive in plenty of time to become butterflies and be released before our vacation. The caterpillars arrived in 3 weeks instead of 1 and only lived for a couple of days. We followed the instructions to the letter. I purchased this kit because of it's size and the opportunity to see at least 10 butterflies. In all fairness to the manufacturer, we haven't tried to obtain replacement caterpillars and will probably try again this spring. All in all this was very disappointing."
1,Very poor customer service,"My son received this as a gift, and I have had too much trouble trying to order the larvae. The code for the larvae on the form in the box is not in the options on their website. I called their number during their business hours (per their website) and got a message saying to call back DURING THE TIME I WAS CALLING. I then tried to send an email via their webform, and it did not work either! I am going to try and find the larvae elsewhere."
5,Excellent experience for children,"This was my daughter's favorite birthday gift. Every stage of receiving the caterpillars, transferring the chrysalids to the pavilion, and feeding the butteflies when they emerged was like magic to her. The instructions encourage exploration and scientific observation - she has kept a daily journal, drawn a picture of a Painted Lady, and wants to take the pavilion to school to show her friends. When sending away for the caterpillars, I really liked their simple privacy statement - ""we don't like telemarketers either"". We love this product, and plan to obtain more caterpillars in the future, once these are released."
1,Warning: Larvae are not shipped during summer!,"My granddaughter saw an ad for the Butterfly pavilion on TV and requested it for her birthday. The shipper was timely, but there was a fatal flaw: They do not ship the larvae from June to September.I understand their reasoning if temperatures are too high, but there were times when they weren't. At the least, the company should make a point of informing consumers before they buy at the times during the year the larvae will be shipped.This was a huge disappointment to my granddaughter, and my rating has to be based on the fact that she could not use the pavilion."
3,Wish I'd known that they won't deliver in summer,"We just ordered our kit and my 5-year old daughter is very eager to get the butterfly larvae; however, when I tried to place the order I was informed that they would die in delivery during the summer months. She recommended I order them in September. Good luck explaining that to my daughter! Looks like a great toy but it's pretty disappointing that this detail was left out."
3,Grandma of 3,"Catapillars took over a month to arrive and that is hard to keep explaining to a four year old everyday. Then when they did finally arrive, they were dead and we had to send them back before they would send us some new ones. Takes too much time for a child to understand. And why would you send catepillars by regular mail in the heat of July?"
1,buyer beware,we ordered this for our 4 year old and when we received the kit along with the coupon to order the larvae we were told that the larvae is not available in our area until September because of the weather. Needless to say we are disappointed.
1,Butterfly Pavilion,"I have not seen any butterflies yet, so it is hard to get excited about this item. I also think it was way overpriced."
1,Stay away from this useless junk,"Nothing about this player makes sense. It is as if it was designed by graduates of Boston College. The buttons take FOREVER to respond, if they respond at all. The order that the songs are in make no sense. Alphabetical..really? I have no idea what RCA was thinking releasing this bomb on the general public."
1,A Piece Of Junk,RCA had a good idea but a bad design. The Software is like trying to find your way through a maze that has no exit. I was a system network engineer and I was ready to bounce it off the walls a few times. The clip broke when trying to ugrade the firmware before we had a chance to use it. I had to call and order another clip which took over and hour. Save up and buy something better or go get a root canal it's less painfull.
4,Nice little player,"I'm really pleased with this MP3 player. I love the small size, it's perfect for working out.I also like the FM tuner option, again handy when I'm at the healthclub and want to tune into the tv. The little toggle for changing options can be a bit touchy but overall for the price and what I want to use it for, it's perfect."
3,Just OK,"Got this as a gift for XMas to replace a lost Rio Cali Sport. I need something light, durable and water-resistant for exercise. This is all that, but I found the controls, and the menus, much less easy to use than the Rio. Also it's easy to jostle the control stick and shut it down in the middle of a run. One other big negative is no slot for an MMR card, which was a big plus of the Cali. (If only I could find another of those!)"
4,Good product,"My 15 year old son got this to replace his Zen Nano that broke. He is rough on stuff and this is a lot sturdier. It's a good player to wear while kicking the soccer ball around or things like that. I've listened to it a few times and sound quality is good. It's a bit bigger than most flash-based MP3 players, but not much so. You can record off FM radio, which my son does a lot. The only negative is that the software to install on your computer is just plain crappy. It's a lot easier to just use Windows Explorer to drag and drop folders and songs from the hard drive."
4,A for OK,"This player is nice it works very easy with my computer. It was a little tricky to figure out all of the controls and my fat ape-like hands have trouble using it. However, it is the right player for me and it seems very durable. Batteries last forever.have fun"
2,lyra - ok,"Purchased 3 for each of my daughters. Product functioned fine for the download of music at first, however a few weeks after installing into the computer, we began to have problems. The program seems to have conflicts with our internet security, and thus must be disabled ever time we down load music. Function and durability of the player unit seem fine."
4,Nice player for the money,"Nice memoryHard to push some buttonsTons of functionality (FM radio, FM radio record, heart rate monitor, etc.)"
2,I cannot take belt clip off the device,"I snapped belt clip on the device and I cannot get it off to replace battery. If an adult strong man cannot get the clip off, how can a child or woman do it?! Be forewarned: never use the belt clip. Features: I haven't gotten to them yet after 2 hours of wrestling with the clip.Update: to remove the clip, you have to push down the top part of the clip, and pull off the bottom part."
4,A GOOD BOOK,"The Idea of Pakistan is a book about the political history of Pakistan with lots of references on such important elements of the society as education and social institutions.Stephen Cohen is a known scholar on Pakistan affairs and has done justice to his findings.This book is relevant for the students of Pakistan affairs and those who would like to have a better understanding of the society, as such.Prof. Dr. Syed Farooq HasnatFormer ChairmanDepartment of Political ScienceUniversity of the Punjab, LahorePakistan"
4,Valuable analysis and predictions,"Its written by a seasoned and established scholar on Pakistan. The book, more analytical in its approach in comparison to other recent works on Pakistan, is a policy oriented discourse which is very valuable. Its much better than Steve cohen's other book on India published a few years ago."
1,this is a BOOTLEG!!!,"this review is for the ""Sailor Moon Limited Edition Box Set II"" DVD.this is a BOOTLEG(unlicensed/unauthorized) release of Sailor Moon. this last season of Sailor Moon(called ""Sailor Stars"") has never been licensed for U.S release, so the sets being sold here through Amazon are bootlegs.don't bother getting this."
1,"This is a bootleg, not official release","Buyer beware. This release is not an official release. In addition, there is hardly any description regarding what this actually consists of. If you scroll through this item page, you'll note that there is a check box for ""bootleg"" in here, which would seem to denote this is a bootleg."
4,Great condition but few flaws,"I got this box set in good condition for the most part. Good quality, but there were some parts where the subtitles did not show up and the last season has some episodes that were almost impossible to watch. Some episodes also froze up. But if you dont mind all of that, then you should be fine.I say this is worth buying if you just want to watch sailor moon, but not a huge fanatic. the price is reasonable and I say buy it because you may never get this chance again."
1,Not good,the dvd keeps hanging up and english dub is not done right. I would like a replacement. dialogue is missing. the work of amatures. not professional.
3,Series Revial,"Reported by ICv2 in April 2010, Toei is now offering all 200 episodes refurbished of the series for internatioal soliction( I don't know if they included the two specials and the three movies though(please have someone answer that part)).Sorry it came so late. And Funimation is looking into getting the rights to redub the series (don't know when they will get the rights, will update when they announce it)."
5,Fabulous,"I took a Terrorism class with Dr. Levinson this summer. The book is great, very thorough. It gives a clear understanding about disaster planning, brilliant!"
4,NHRA QMS - Great On-Line Game,"This game is really great! It's the closest thing to real NHRA professional Drag Racing. The physics and grafix are excellent cause u really get to feel the car when its goin down the track. There's tire shake, tire smoke, dropped cylinders, blower explosions, and of course the best of all the flames all lit when u make a night time pass. There are Top Fuel Dragsters, Nitro Funny Cars, and Pro Stocks with all your favorite drivers from the 2006 NHRA championship. It's a bit difficult to tune these cars but with some practice and some help from other on-line racers you can have a real blast with this game. Remember to install the patch from valusoft and you can go on-line to race with the best."
1,This game sucks!!!!!,I cannot believe NHRA allowed it's name to be used on this game. What a pile of garbage!!!!
2,"Ripped from the video, not re-mastered!","If you already own the video for this concert you have an idea of the sound quality. Not sure what all these other reviews are doing here, but they are not for this concert."
1,"Thin Lizzy,The Boys are back in town","I don't know if I listened to the same cd as the other peoplethat reviewed this cd. The musicianship is there but the soundquality is just plain awful. It sounds as if if this came fromsome one in the audiance recording it. The guitars seem to dropoff soon after each song starts. Maybe the worst live Lizzy albumI've heard. I wished I could hear the bonus cd that was offeredbefore, it sounds like the better of the two.Dave Walsh"
4,Diego's only solo album,"Este es el unico album como solista que DIEGO saco al mercado despues de su separacion de TIMBIRICHE y el subsecuente reencuentro de el 98-99. Este material me parece muy bueno y tiene canciones muy sentimentales y de muy buena calidad como ""Quiero darme tiempo,"" ""Estas dentro de mi,"" "" A donde vas,"" ""Y todo porque tu,"" y el cover de ""Save up all your tears"" de CHER que en voz de DIEGO se titula ""Ya empece a ser feliz."" A todos aquellos fans de DIEGO y miembros de la GENERACION TIMBIRICHE les recomiendo altamente que obtengan este album."
5,BEST FILM EVER,"I am bitter and angry...this film has irritated me highly...it's not on DVD!! This film is the best film you could ever wish to see with more information than many of the best internet sites in the world, there are hundreds of websites devoted to this video and it is the best program i have ever watched on TV and although I dont watch many programmes and it's unusual for me to rate something so highly, this is a great program that i would die a happy man if it was to be released on DVD"
2,Sub-Standard Product,"As one reviewer put it, purchasing and shipping worked OK. As another put it, these do measure 15/16"" inside diameter, but they are so soft that they stretch. Who knows how long they will last after being stretched?Also, these are not the rounded tip product shown in the photo, nor are they the rounded tip product shown on the box they came in. They are a soft tipped, somewhat flared and concave tip. More of a cane tip than the crutch tips I'm accustomed to using.If you don't mind your home stinking like uncured rubber, go ahead and purchase these. I opened the box a few days ago and my workshop is permeated with the smell of uncured Asian rubber.Bottom Line: I won't purchase these again and I won't recommend them to anyone, simply because they are not the product pictured, and they stink, literally.CRUTCH TIPS (2) CARA 42 Size: 1""Please note that this is no reflection on the seller."
4,mini trampoline feet replacements,"These metal-reinforced crutch tips work just fine to replace the worn-out rubber feet for myUrban Rebounder Folding Trampoline Workout System(I bought it almost two years ago now). They are tan instead of black. Other than that they are almost identical. My only complaint is that the opening for the trampoline leg (or crutch pole) is 15/16 of an inch in diameter instead of a whole inch as advertised. But they still fit. Possibly if I ever need more I will try theCrutch Tips(2), Cara 43, 1-1/8 Inchesinstead. You can also order more replacement crutch tips from the Urban Rebounder manufacturer's site but those cost more- $4.75 for one crutch tip and $8.95 for shipping and handling."
5,no problems yet,"I put two of these into a 125 gallon tank. They've done fine for over 6 months. What a relief that I don't have to fiddle with them or second guess what they are doing.I've been through a lot of heaters. I have yet to find a decent one of those glass heaters with the temperature adjustment dial on top. I have come to hate those. What's so hard, in this decade when we take pictures of planets circling distant stars, about making a reliable, repeatable, and decently precise aquarium heater? Are they being made by stoned rastafarians?Anyways, after 6 months I am starting to grudgingly appreciate these ones."
5,Book of Hours,"When I joined the Church I was given a book titled ""A Short Breviary"" and it was the foundation of my prayer life. But after awhile the 8 hours ecame too inconvenient for me. Now I have discovered Dr. Storey's 2 volumes of ""An Everyday Book of Hours"" and ""A Seasonal Bok of Hours"" and they are a delight. Once again I am praying with the Church. My thanks to you and to Dr. Storey."
2,Small,"This kite was purchased to be displayed in a classroom during the week with the ""Space"" theme. For that, it has not been used as a kite properly.In general, the material is fine, the printing is fine, but it lacks details and it is rather small.I think it is an OK product to fly it up in the sky (which it's its purpose) but does not have the realistic details I have seen in others."
3,I liked the book but not what I was looking for.,I liked that it was a mystery book because I love mystery books. I didn't like the part where the girl teased her all the time because it happens to lots of people. I liked the part where she meets the old lady and she gives her three wishes because of what she did for her. All I wanted was to find out what happens at the end.
1,PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"I used to read ""Goosbumps"" books. It was the first series of books I ever read. At the time they were the only books I woul read. Some of them were good. This was one of the worst that I did read. My advise is, if you like R.L. Stine, read his books. Don't tie yourself down to him. There are many better or equally good authers. Read the classics. Read ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", and ""The Dark is Rising"" chronicle and other classics. If you don't like these books, read ""Animorphs"". They are good too. Just remember, ignore the reading level ratings on the back of some books, and read all genres. Reading makes you more intelligent. You'll be smarter, your grades will inprove, and you will allways have something to do when you're bored."
4,it was awesome,this was a really good book i love how it kept you on the edge of ur seat once i starded it i couldent put it down the only reason i made it less then five stars is i think it ended to early what were judiths other two wishes and what happens to samantha after she is a bird i think stine ended it to early that is all
3,Wishes and nightmares,"Samantha is a klutz. A walking disaster. And mean Judith is always bullying her. One day Samantha helps a woman find her way. To repay her kindness, the woman grants her 3 wishes. Her wishes come true, but not in the way she expected. In fact they make her life worse.This was an okay story, nothing more."
5,Encourages reading,My 8yr old granddaughter reads these outloud to me for reading credit for school. We both enjoy these series.
3,The Light is Pale,"I really enjoy this series, I enjoy the writer, but to be honest I think the ""Goddess of Light"" book is a pale imitation of what it could be.My main complaint is that the characters in this book are insubstantial. I did not find anything that stood out to me about Pamela Gray nor did Apollo particuarly set himself apart. There was no history behind Pamela aside that from a severely clingy husband and her ability to make eccentric tastes into high interior style.Apollo was nothing more then a pretty boy with a longing for a soulmate. He had nothing in his personality that particularly drew me to his character.About the only characters that had any substance to them were Artemis and E.D. Faust.I still have hope for this series of books and will continue to read anything new that she puts out, I just hope that she's able to reconnect with the writing of her first book and once again bring to life some interesting characters."
4,Another good read,"I love this series ~ was this the best of the bunch ~ no, but it was good. I agree we could find out more about Pamela & Apollo, especially the end (which left you wondering) but I was happy with it. My favorite of the series was Hades story. The next in the series sounds really good. So I would recommend this book."
3,Disappointing,"When I compare this book to Goddess of the Sea and Goddess of Spring (the first two books in this series) I can't help but be seriously disappointed. I thought that the characters were all interesting and the plot was definitely original, but I hated the ending. Hated it. I thought it could've been a lot better and I was really sad at the direction she took, I mean, it didn't really work out for anyone. And its especially tragic when you look at how the Goddess of Spring was resolved. Anyway, it's still a good read, and if you've enjoyed her work previously you probably will like this one too. And I know that many people were happy with the ending so this might just be me."
5,Beautiful.,"Finally!Someone who can write about a beautiful man - god or mortal, that is not only the opposite of the stereotypical literary male, but is actually interesting!The scenery is beautiful. You feel like you're really there, or wish like hell you really were.P. C. Cast, I'm going to read all your books!!"
3,Good but the end was dissapointing,"I really liked this story, it was charming and filled with great and multi-levelled characters and settings. Pamela, her witty business partner Verlaine (who we only got to meet over the phone unfortunately), the fantasy writer Eddie, the misplaced Olympian gods Apollo and Artemis - all of them made up this great romantic adventure. And it carried on well, until the end, where I got the feeling that the writer tangled herself up in a plot that didn't match the rest of the story. It got too different and complicated and constructed and thus it failed. When a story loses its flow and blows out of tangent like that, at least I get dissapointed."
3,Goddess of Light,"Having read the Goddess of Spring, which I thought was great, this book is not bad reading, however a little drawn out and lacking some adventure."
5,Love this series.,Love this series! Haven't read anything this well written in a while. P.c. cast is great! Hope there is more to come!
1,"Too much of a HUMAN emphasis on ""finding the love of your..""","After reading Elisabeth Elliot's ""Passion and Purity"", ""Quest For Love"", Joshua Harris's ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" and Don Raunikar's ""Choosing God's Best""...this book sadly fails! It lacks true inspiration from the Holy Spirit, does not have the ""annointing"" the other books above do. I came away reading this book with ""this is man's way of doing the relationship thing, not God's way"". It emphasized taking it into your own hands rather than relying on God to reveal His choice. It just perpetuates the ""dating merry-go-round"" many singles are on trying to find the right one, find the one who is ""compatible""."
2,Read Sacred Marriage instead,"This book and the workbook had some good principles and things to talk about with your future husband/wife. But really, I would recommend Sacred Marriage, by Gary Thomas for engaged or newlyweds."
5,Love the book,I heard about this book form a friend and so I thought I would like reading and learning about the right person for me.
3,All common sense,"A good book for me while I was on the brink of a breakup. Leaving him was the best decision as he fitted all the 'wrong' criteria this book mentions when vetting a partner. It was good to see 'right' vs 'wrong' criteria written down; what I already, deep down, knew, but couldn't bring myself to admit and make the break.Most of the content is common sense - eg pick a partner with the same interests, views, beliefs etc, someone who treats you right, while avoiding someone who has few similar philosophies and is controlling, lying, bad-tempered etc. I could essentially 'tick off' the wright vs wrong criteria in my parter, making it crystal clear I was with the wrong man.When you're wrapped up in the emotion of a bad relationship sometimes you need a book like this to help you see the wood through the trees."
5,Great Value for the $,I purchased this fan for work which is a large office space. The fan is quiet and is not distracting when in use on my desk. It does not affect my phone when it is in use either. I enjoy the fact that it can be stationary or oscillate. I also get a lot of good compliments about my fan from coworkers.
3,Decent fan but not quiet,"The air flow is focused and not very powerful, but it's good enough to use for desk use. The problem is that the fan isn't quiet, even at the lowest setting. Also there is no timer, and there is no way to plug this into an external timer because the switch is digital. Other than that it's a decent fan with a slim elegant design.Pros:* Slim, elegant* Tilt function* Good airflowCons* Noisy even at lowest setting* No timer, and can't use external timer because of digital switch"
5,Not a bad little fan,This fan works quite well for an office desk. It is fairly quiet on the low setting and moves enough air to keep you cool.
2,A little noisy and not too powerful,"This is a pretty noisy fan with not much power. I purchased it for my office but the noise is distracting . If you are using in an environment which already has background noice then it's ok,especially for the price. It will cost me too much to ship it back so I am keeping it for a back up."
4,"Effective, sleek fan",Really love this fan. I bought it for my cubicle space at work which is quite warm. This fan is sleek and very effective at cooling my work space. I love that it oscillates and it's not too loud that it bothers my coworkers. The fan has a low hum when at the highest setting which is great at drowning out people talking around you while providing a cool breeze. I would definitely recommend this fan.
2,Loud and Annoying,"This fan keeps you cool, but is ear piercingly loud. I do not know if I got a defective model or what not, but the sound is like a dog whistle for humans."
4,A decent fan.,"The fan is good to put next to the bed. I use it there and it keeps me pretty cool at night. On super hot nights though, it is not enough."
3,"Great looks, size, speed but high-pitched whir/whine","POSITIVESLove the color, relatively compact size, and fan speeds. Low is great for desktop or personal fan as long as it's not blowing right on papers. Oscillation makes a good sweep too.CONSToo tall if you need this to fit under an overhead bin in an office cubicle. The machine also has a moderately-high pitched whir/whine that is louder than the sound of the air blowing. I returned the first one and the second one was quieter the first time I plugged it in, then just as noisy as the first one. I could hear the whir/whine from another room even on low speed. If your office is not super-quiet or you are not using this as white noise it's still a great choice. Otherwise I'd keep looking."
4,Super compact. Perfect for smaller rooms and office cubicles.,"Simple operation. 2-speed super compact low profile oscillating fan. Perfect for smaller rooms and office cubicles. Not an eye-sore, not at all.Check out the user images above for size comparisons.There are only 2 buttons:1st button - 1) Power On/Hi 2) Low speed 3) Off2nd button - 1) Oscillation On 2) Oscillation OffPros:+ Love its compactness.+ Very light. Easy to move from room to room.+ Generally more quiet operation than most fans.+ Oscillating+ Only around 23 wattsCons:- If you need more wind power, look somewhere else.- Oscillating range is pretty limited. Maybe just around 10-25 degrees.Made in China."
4,Great little air mover.,"I have had this unit for several weeks and use it to cool my office. I have a large window which heats up in the afternoon.So far it has been great. It's quiet, decent size and oscilates. Pretty simple design so I guess you get what you pay for.Love this little unit."
4,Great desk fan,"After some research, I just got this as a replacement to my 10 year old 5"" desk fan. This is a nice improvement. It's slim profile saves desk space. The low speed setting isn't very useful, but on high it works quite well directing air very precisely. Air can be felt easily from 10 feet away. The squirrel cage fan has plenty of velocity for a small desk fan. It also has an oscillating feature which is a nice bonus.My one complaint is that it only has 3 rubber feet which creates instability if you press a button from any angle other than straight on. Minor annoyance. I fixed this by adding 4 small rubber feet from some small electronics I had lying around."
4,Great little space fan,"Very sharp looking fan and small enough to not be the first thing you see when you walk in the room. We run it all night long (12 hrs) in my son's room. Only thing is that instead of a blowing sound you would normally get from a fan, this is more like high pitched blow, almost whistle like. Still able to sleep through it, but wouldn't be my first choice of white noise."
4,"Good fan, if oscillations was faster...","Good little fan. I use it to blow the A/C around so it would cool down my room more evenly. It compact and pretty good fan. The oscillation is just very SLOW, I mean its like not having it.Also, there is one button to turn on the fan and change speeds. You would have to press it until it turns off, and to get to your level. I wish there was another control for that."
3,Lasko 4000 Wind Tower a good purchase!,"Purchased the Lasko 4000 wind tower because the office I work at is always above 80-degrees farenheit and I got frustrated with always being hot, and uncomfortable working. The Lask04000 is relatively quiet, there is a slight whirring noise when the high speed selection is chosen but it is not very much. The air produced by the windtower is cool, does enough to keep me comfortable throughout the day and I am glad to have made this purchase!"
5,"Small but powerful, great little fan","I bought this fan expecting something much bigger, it was replacing a 12 inch round oscillating fan, this one is 14 inches high by 3.5 inches wide by 4 inches deep and puts out airflow greater than the round fan about 1.5 times or more is a good estimate, I would defiantly recommend this fan, highly recommend it matter of fact and I am planning on buying another next month."
3,Good fan,"The fan is great for small areas because it does not take up a lot of space. I recently noticed that sometimes when the fan is turned on and it is rotating, it would make an annoying sound while it is turning as if it was breaking. It was easily fixed by just turning it off and on again."
2,"Works, price is ok, but noisy","Does not blow that much air around, but is enough for sitting it on my desk.Seems like either mine is defective or these are prone to it, but mine has a loud vibrating sound when on. I would have returned it for being so annoyingly loud, but it seems to go away if I put it on it's side."
2,Noisy,"If you use it on high it is too loud to sleep next too on a night stand, low will do the trick and move some air, however after 3 months of use it started to develop a loud chatter, I tried to shake, slap, and blow it out with an air compressor. None of them worked, so I am now looking for a new fan."
1,cheap junk,Lasted 6 weeks then motor burnt out.more required words: junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk
3,"Good fan, but LOUD","Great size for a desk fan, love the oscillation. However, on high it is ridiculously loud and disruptive to the workplace. On low it's okay, more like white noise, but still loud. I only turn it on after walks when I'm hot b/c of the noise.If you don't care about noise, then it does have good air output and feels great!"
5,BUY AMERICAN,"We have asked amazon.com to publish country of origin with no response. Therefore, this product is produced in the USA and is excellent. We bought the small vertical and tall vertical ones and are extremely pleased."
2,Nothing Great - slightly lower value for the money,"This fan is a good for one person's use. It can't be used even for 2 people. With price about $20, it is less value for the money."
2,Saves space but not effective at all,It's too small for even a small room. The fan is not very powerful and the oscillator was defective so I had to return it.
1,Bad Vaule for Price,This item is very small and a piece of junk. It says two blower settings - correct - barely and not as stong as a breath.Save your money and go to WalMart
4,pushes a lot of air for its size,"Small little thing, fits right in the space on my desk next to my monitor. A little loud on high-speed in a sorta-OK kind of white noise, but, it does push a lot of air for its size. The low-speed setting is quieter but definitely not silent, and doesnt push much air around at all and might as well be forgotten. Probably an OK buy if and only if you can deal with the humming noise it makes."
5,great little fan!,"I only got to use this fan for a few days now, but it is so much better than my old ""circular"" fan I can definitely recommend it. I use it in my office, which gets very warm and stuffy. This fan throws very cool air even in warm environments. Seems like my old circular fan just blew warm air around--this fan almost feels like a little air conditioner! Takes up almost no room and looks nice. Fairly quiet. Great buy!"
5,Nice little fan,I really like this little fan. It gives off a LOT of air and fits into small places. I wish I would have bought 2.
4,Good small quiet sleek inexpensive low-power fan with many uses,"Short Answer:Decent fan, but only for a small area or personal use.Detailed Answer:It's just over a foot tall, but it moves a good amount of air for its size, which is surprising for how quiet it is. But it is obviously a pretty small fan, so don't expect it to cool the entire room. Much better suited for a desktop or end table. Also works great next to the bed.What I Like:It's built quite solidly. It has two air speeds - medium and hi. It has two oscillation speeds - low and off. The approximate period of oscillation is a calm 21 seconds at either air speed. The unit consumes a gentle 25 watts maximum, according to my Kill-A-Watt.What's Not To Like:The degree of oscillation is quite small - it sweeps an area of only about 30 degrees. On the power button there is a blue L.E.D., which is cool and pleasant during the day, but overpoweringly bright at night. I covered the light with black electrical tape so I could sleep."
3,Not quiet!!,"For me, this fan was not at all quiet. I agree with the reviewer who said it makes a loud whining noise when on high. It does put out lots of cool air on high, but it's just about useless on low. A medium speed would probably be a plus here. Unfortunately, I had to return it and will try a different desk fan soon."
2,"Loud, Small, & Annoying","While it blows air, it does so at a noise level that is not necessary in a pitch that is not pleasing to the ear. Bad decision. Don't listen to the 4 star review rating like I did & waste your money on this. In fact, today I've boughten another fan on Amazon to replace this thing, and this Lasko Stik will probably either get shuffled over to my work desk to drown out other noises while I work or go to Goodwill."
2,Noisy and Disappointing,"I was so enamored of my large Lasko column fan's quiet efficiency, I thought this would deliver the same.Nope. It is annoyingly loud, with a whiny hum and the rotation is limited -- about 25 degrees? I can only feel it when I'm within arm's length. Very disappointing."
2,Lasko fan,High pitched whiny noisy fan. Circulates air decently but is just to obnoxious a sound to have going for long.
4,One out of two,"Ordered two, received them quickly. However one no longer works. In Iraq so its a bummer to order and get let down. Its a real pain when you have to return something you have to wait almost two weeks for...not their fault that I'm halfway around the world.Perfect size for your desk though..."
2,Practical But Noisy,"The fan is exactly what I expected from the pictures and other reviews: small footprint, oscillating, etc. What I didn't expect is how noisy it is. I am really shocked by the level of noise this fan creates. In a work/cubicle environment, it's definitely not tolerable."
2,Very Weak,"This fan does indeed have two settings, they should probably be named 'Very Low' and 'Even Lower'. It is small and looks nice on a desk but if what you need is something to move air around (rather than a desk ornament) I would recommend a different product, this one just does not have enough strength."
4,Good product: but one problem I hadn't foreseen,"I bought this fan about a month ago, to fit in a tight spot on my work desk. It seems to be a good product: it's very compact and occupies a very small footprint, relative to its cooling power. It's tolerably quiet, albeit not silent. The one deficiency that I hadn't foreseen is that, unlike radial fans, you cannot direct the airstream up or down. It can only be directed horizontally. Therefore, you have to mount the fan at a height that's exactly correct, relative to the level at which you want the airstream."
4,Good,"Good fan. Quiet enough and puts out enough air at low speed to keep me comfortable at my desk. Only downside is that the power/oscillate buttons are too stiff. If you press them without supporting the fan, it will tip over."
5,Moves a lot of air for such a little fan,"This fan is great for an office with limited desk space. My fan sits about 5 feet away from me so I was concerned that it wouldn't do the job on a warm day, but I have found the lower fan speed is more than adequate. The high speed setting was too much air blowing on me. The fan is quiet but not completely silent."
2,It's loud.,"There is nothing quiet about this fan at all. Even on the lowest setting, there is a high-pitch whine that will drive you and your coworkers insane. If you set it to high, it's almost as loud as a hair dryer. I love the design and the small space that it takes up, but I'm returning it to the store."
2,Way to loud,I bought this for my daughters room thinking the size would be great and it was. But the fan was way to loud she couldn't even sleep with it on. Not sure I would recommend this for a room where you will have some one sleeping or were you need to hear over the fan. I ended up returning it and am currently searching for something else.
2,Noisy as hell,"I had a fan I picked out of the trash that puts out as much or more air and is quieter (it has a larger profile and the oscillator stopped working, so I bought this). I am returning this. It has a whine to it like I'm sleeping next to an overclocked computer."
2,disappointed,I was looking for a fan for my dsk that was whisper quiet. I had read all the reviews for this product and thought I finally found what I was looking for. It fits nicely on my desk and looks great but it isn't as quiet as I thought it would be. Nice fan but if you are looking for something whisper quiet this isn't for you
2,Loud,"""2 quiet speed settings""? Not so much. This thing makes an obnoxiously loud whining noise. The ""most helpful critical review"" posted by K. Sime is absolutely right.You're better off getting a used Hawaiian Breeze off Craigslist for half the price."
2,Too loud. But very compact.,"I bought this to replace an old cheap no name brand that I got from the big box chain store that I hate going to. I had that one for 5 years that finally died on me. It was about the same size and it oscillated as well. It was half the price 5 years ago. I didn't go back and look for another, cause I hate shopping there. But this one was so loud, I ended up returning it. It had a high pitch to it, especially on the High setting. Also, it started stuttering on the 2nd day when I had it in the oscillating mode. I returned it, and got the Ozeri Breeza. Much quieter, puts out a lot more air, if you want it, and had 3 settings instead of 2.I will say one thing for the Lasko. It is small. So if space is limited, and you don't mind keeping it on the low setting, it might be a good option for you. But I would probably look for a different brand that makes one in that design.I gave it two stars because it did work, and it was small."
5,great size,I use this in my bathroom and it is perfect for the counter and for keeping cool while you get ready.
3,Noisier than expected,"This fan produces about as much circulation as you'd expect for its size. If your main desire is a small fan that doesn't take up much room, this one does a decent job. However, I was looking for a quiet fan for the bedroom and bought this because the Product Features indicates it has 2 quiet settings, and based on a number of reviews that said it was really quiet. I was also hopeful that being ""ultra-slim"" meant it had a better chance of being ultra-quiet. Unfortunately it's not. I wouldn't say it's a noisy fan -- quieter than a Vornado on its lowest setting -- but I wouldn't call it quiet either. If I hadn't bought it online I'd probably return it but we'll just use it another room."
4,"Good for Desktop, not Bedside Table","Pros - sleek styling, space efficient size, good air flow.Cons - on/off switch is illuminated with bright blue light that is too strong for bedside application at night for those sensitive to light; motor has a high pitch whine that is also less practical for bedroom/sleep application for those more sensitive to noise when falling asleep."
5,Perfect,I ordered this fan for my office at work and it's perfect. It's very quiet and fits into any corner or under a desk. Exactly what I needed with a great price.
5,"Awesome small, quiet and powerful fan.",I don't know about durability but it is a impressive fan for the price. Feels well made and so far I love it!!!
2,Very loud,"My only complaint is the noise. I purchased this fan for my office, and I have to turn it off while I'm on the phone due to noise."
2,Not very quiet,"This fan is described as having ""2 quiet speed settings"". Sadly, my fan had a high-pitch whine that was pretty annoying. The illuminated buttons were also too bright for nighttime use in a bedroom."
2,"Effective, but noisy","Very effective, but noisy even in the low flow/ rotating mode. While one can sleep throught the noise, it does affect light sleepers."
4,Great fan for small spaces,"I needed a small fan to keep in the bathroom. I was looking for a small square-shaped fan when I came across this model.Looking at the photo, I immediately recognized an advantage of this type of fan over the type I was looking for- this one takes up less real estate on the counter.When I received the fan, I was pleasantly surprised at how thing this thing is. It doesn't look too big on the bathroom counter, has 2 speeds that are enough, and doesn't put out too much sound.I would give this fan 5 stars if it went a little faster :-)"
4,"Pretty good - I'd go for the Seville fan, though","Pretty good. It's slim and pretty nice looking. It also puts off a decent volume of air, compared to its size. I'd go for the Seville fan though. That fan is quieter, puts off more air, and has many more features (like a timer and 3-speed options)."
2,"slim and stylish, but not the quietest fan","A clean, attractive unit that fits nicely on the desk behind my computer, but I will say I was expecting a quieter fan. The unit has two speeds and the high setting is practically speaking, too loud if you are on the phone. Low speed even is quite a bit louder than any computer cooling fan. This fan is not a personal or small office fan unless you are okay with a constant whir in your ear. The sound from it even pitches up and down when oscillating. On the bright side, it is compact and kicks out a pretty strong breeze so for cooling, it is pretty good. if you want quite though, stick with a small prop fan."
2,For small places only,"I bought two of these little oscillating fans, first I didn't realize they were as small as they are, second I loved the style, third one conked out after only a month. the other one still work however, does put out much breeze. Cute little fans for small places, don't expect big things.Oh most Important I have this one in my bedroom the blue lights are bright keeps me awake if you like darkness while going to sleep don't buy this fan."
4,"EXTREMELY quiet, just wish it had a bit more airflow","Overall a great fan and I recommend it. Does the job I need, but I wish it pushed a bit more air."
1,These are not games!,"This is a collection of worksheets, some of which are extremely difficult. None of them are fun! Don't waste your time or money. These ""games"" would be quite challenging for high schoolers but down-right deadly for middle schoolers! I agree that they would fill those ""perilous minutes"" after a test or activity, but why would you want to fill those minutes with dreck and frustration? Most of these worksheets would require an entire lesson to go along with them. With many, the directions were not particularly clear. I only figured out what I was supposed to do when I peeked at the answers!"
2,"Disappointed - VERY, VERY basic.","The first secion of this video is just beyond basic and worthless to anyone but true beginners.I own dozens of videos, and this one is the most worthless waste of time that I own.To the others that rate it highly, I can only assume they are new to the BB coaching game and don't have anything to compare it to.Gannon Bakers video absolutely blows this away. There is just no comparison. Watch it, then go back and watch this video and you'll see what I mean."
3,Setting-up not intuitive,"PROS:Easy to read time.Illuminator (back-light) function to read time in dark places.Value for Price.CONS:Setting up the time and date was not really intuitive. Though I somehow nailed it, it was much harder than I've imagined and the product manual wasn't much of a help. I'm now kind a hesitate using it's timer as I'm afraid of setting off the beeper at the wrong time/place.The color of the band in the picture is quite different that the actual one. It looks much gray-ish in the picture than the actual one which I would have preferred. The product is more on a blue-er side, like ice-blue."
4,Autograph Collecting pre-2000,"Correct title: ""The Guinness Book of World Autographs"", hardback, first hardback published in 1977 in Enfield-Middlesex England, 244 pgs (ISBN:0900424737). (Re-published in 1978 as ""The Stein & Day Book of World Autographs"") Hundreds of facsimile autographs and identifications of famous personalities from around the world: military, political, literature, monarchs, astronauts, musicians, scietists, prime ministers, presidents, etc. Not a scholarly work, but a nice reference for the dedicated autograph collector. (See also the author's ""Four Hundred Years of British Autographs"")"
5,Classic Movie,Great movie in the amazing Something Weird Video catalog. Find this movie and watch it if you can get your hands on it. I love these guys!
2,about what you would expect,"these movies are about sexy goings on. they are typical of the late 60's early 70's style film that showed in downtown theaters or drive ins. there is some plot that serves to get the characters into each others pants. the women are fairly good looking, the men are macho enough, the dialogue...well. if you are interested in dialogue, you are looking in the wrong place."
2,Peripheral Musculoskeletal Ultrasound: A CD ROM Atlas,"Pictures are only fair, and too small. Cumbersome system for moving through the slides. I couldn't get the videos to work at all!!The book atlas from this company is actually a bit better amd more comprehensive.I would only get this for it's portability, but would recommend McNally (atlas in book form) as the best atlas out there at the moment.It is also much more useful as a reference to look at during procedures. Hopefully McNally will make a CD ROM, or the people from Jefferson University will produce something."
3,That bassline!,"Unlike many of my middle-aged compadres here, I discovered ""Rise"" by way of The Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotise."" I'd owned ""Whipped Cream & Other Delights"" for a while, but I did not know that Alpert had done anything as funky as the title track for this 1979 LP.From the second ""1980"" starts playing, the listener quickly realises this is no Tijuana brass. It's a thumpin' funky ensemble which does it's best to get down. Unfortunately, much of the disc crosses over into the ""Music for Lifts"" category, ""Love Is"" being the most proper example. Last week, hearing a snippet of ""Rise"" on the radio, I was horrified to discover it was playing on a ""smooth jazz"" channel!But you get the idea, ""Rise"" was a great statement and change of pace for Alpert, and that classic bassline has turned up everywhere from ""Hypnotise"" to Brian Eno & David Byrne's ""Regiment"" from the ""My Life In the Bush of Ghosts"" experiment."
5,Awesome,"I've been a Herb Alpert fan for a time now, and I have almost all of his albums. He is no doubt my favorite instrumentalist. This is my favorite of his. This album paved the future of contemporary jazz music. This is also one of my favorite types of music, elevator music. That's right. ""1980"" is a great opener, and ""Rise"" gets you in the mood for anything. The rest of the album is just relaxing."
2,Didn't get the job done...,"I recently started a project that required an upholstery needle (12"") to attach a button for that 'tufted' pillow look. Let's just say, it didn't go well. These needles are tragically dull and unable to pass through muslin or quilting cotton (which is an impressive failure). With quite a bit of force, and bending the needle in the process, I finally got the needle through, but it just wasn't up to the job in the long run.Maybe I just don't understand upholstery needles, but I was disappointed with these. I don't think I'll be going to these for further upholstery projects.Needless to say, I love every other Dritz product I own."
4,Works but a little dull Long Straight Upholstery Hand Needles- 4/Pk,"Long Straight Upholstery Hand Needles- 4/Pk . Great product, the needles were straight and strong. The only problem was, the needles were a little dull. I sharpened them with a little sand paper and now they work fantastic."
2,Synthesisers,"I and my son loved cd's 1 and 2, but this was quite poor. Its all done on a synthesiser, so it sounds like background music for a kids tv show. Listen only if you want to feel like a demented geriatric in a nursing home."
1,Horrible.,I bought Lovely Baby CD Volumes 2 and 3 because my son and I love Volume 1 and Lovely Sleepy Baby CDs. I could not be more disappointed. F.
3,Great and Good Book,"The book has GREAT content! Every one who reads it can come away changed! It gives so much insight into why we think and react the way we do, and others. Some chapters may not apply to you, but read them anyway, it will help you better understand others who it does apply to. Try walking in their shoe!The condition of the book was good but very warn. It was still intact and readable, at any price it is a bargain!"
5,Straight foward and easy to understand.,"I am a middle aged man, who as been in many relationships, the concept of codependency, was bought to my attention just recently. Love is a Choice, was the second book that I read on the topic. It was an utter and complete eye opening experience, I didn't know it's name, but codependency is how I was trained to be in relationship with people, especially my partner. I have been in many, many romantic relationships that ended in heart break, it is not what I wanted for my life. I knew it wasn't all my fault, or all their fault, but why? Love is a Choice, has set me in the right direction with the right mix of science and faith."
1,Not an easy read.,This book is complicated and hard to read. I found myself thinking of something else while reading just because it had too many specialty words..it's not easy to understand.
2,"Competent, but a Snooze...","Had to write a review since there are no sound clips for this CD. Don't know why I thought this would be much better than it is. I think I heard something on RadioIO Ambient. But anyway, this is well recorded and mixed, and in the ambient vein. However, there's no sense of mood or composition whatsoever. Sorry to say... just mundane chord changes with a few slightly interesting sounds over some slightly interesting rhythms... sometimes. Also, a few of the tunes have some more annoying than not vocals in the mix. It's all too repetitive with no sense of mood or ambience, no build up of tension and release... just basically some sounds and rhythms mixed together with no sense of purpose. Go get Canartic, the Orb, Sounds From The Ground, Mr. Soon, Stress Assassin, Hibernation, Neuropop's Overload: The Sonic Intoxicant, Pole, Pre Fade Listening, Praguedren, Kani... among many others... instead."
2,This is not a Karaoke CD,I buy this cd because I read on the description this is a Karaoke cd but is not.
2,Why can't I have the actual dvd of the movie?,"I am very disappointed because there is no option for me to buy this dvd and have it mailed to my house.I was able to purchase ""The Stranger"" and have the dvd shipped to my house.If anyone knows why this choice is not offered with The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, please post explanation.hughart_kathleen@yahoo.com"
4,Running as protest,"This was a fascinating novel I read over 30 years ago. Seeing that it had been made into a movie, I bought it. I wasn't disappointed. Although a lot of time is spent documenting the runner's social/economic conditions, it ultimately makes sense in the context of the ending. I particularly liked the way the story shows the raw underbelly of poverty/social stigma (in England) and how people deal with it. From gleefully spending a loved ones insurance money, to stealing a car for fun, the story pulls no punches. It becomes easy to identify with the protagonist. The movie never veers from the novel in any significant way. It is all too clear why the runner does what he does at the end, despite knowing exactly what will result for him. I found the acting and filming superb."
3,DVD is slightly cropped,"This is a wonderful British film and the DVD is an excellent transfer, except for one detail -- it has been cropped from its original 1.66 ratio (the prevailing British standard for the time) to 1.85. I wish they'd left it in its original form, as they did Julie Christie's Darling. It's a small bone of contention but to the purist these things matter."
1,Ulitmate on my laptop - a flop,"This software does not work properly on my Sony laptop. I can see the games, but the mouse(pad) doesn't show up. It is simply a flittering shadow and I can't play the games."
2,Graphics are very poor,The games are fine. There are a lot of variations but the graphics are so poor that it makes it difficult to play. It looks like the graphics were originally made for VGA (640 x 480) resolution and then stretched to fit a higher resolution screen. The result is that on a higher resolution monitor (even just 1024x768) the graphics look fuzzy and out of focus.
2,PC Games,There was not enough information given before I ordered this. It is not compatible with my PC. A waste of money.
2,Don't be tempted,"This looked like great value and it does have some nice features. But it is not expandable for more handsets, baffles people not used to it and worst of all lasted just over a year before death. Stick to Uniden; Panasonic has class action suits against them for their poor quality cordless phones."
4,Amazed at quality,"Just received this (along with the H7718 chest). I've gone over both with a fine tooth comb, and cannot find any flaws on either. Both were well packaged. The cabinet had some visible damage to the box, but I opened it while driver present and everything was in good condition. I was surprised at the quality... solid woods (except drawer bottoms), quality hardware, good color matching throughout. I'll probably cover the drawer bottoms so as not to get the felt greasy. Both come with removable lockable front panels which are probably unnecessary for my use, but some may find a benefit. If you have looked longingly at the Gerstner cabinets - as I have - but couldn't pull the trigger on price, these are a steal."
1,disappointed,"What was advertised was sheepskin, what arrived was imitation! Also, advertised was crutch covers for the armpits AND handles. The handle covers were missing. I would never buy from this company again."
1,"Nice but small, but it seems to work. No customer support",The desk is good and works ok but the company has absolutly no customer support. I called them about a dented piece and they referred me back to Amazon who had to send me a whole new desk!!The desk deserves more stars but I can only make this a one star review because of the manufacturer/importer's policies toward customers.
3,An Entertaining Way to Learn About The One True Faith,"Yep, that's what we called it in parochial grade school.For people born Catholic, there is a lot of fun in this book. For people not born Catholic, the book might provoke a lot more questions than it might provide answers. Clearly, the author(s) love the Church but are frustrated about the u-turns taken since the Second Vatican Council. The new pope is not going to take the church in any more progressive direction, either, so I wonder how a current edition of this book might read today."
3,Light entertainment,"Fleetingly funny here and there, but nothing very new. Not much more substantive than the humor sections from the Reader's Digest, which usually resides in most people's bathrooms. Probably a good place for this book. A quick read, mildly entertaining. If you want to read a good book about the old pre-Vatican II Church, read Powers' MORTE D'URBAN, or his son's book, DO PATENT LEATHER SHOES REALLY REFLECT UP? - Tim Bazzett, author of REED CITY BOY and PINHEAD: A LOVE STORY"
3,Living Catholic,"This book examines how times have changed in the Catholic church and religion. Catholuc colleges, famous Catholics and movies are presented here. a decent look at the worl's most popular religion."
2,"Cools However, it Leaks Rivers of water on the Floor...","The unit does cool wonderfully, However it has leaked rivers of water onto my carpet. I have left 3 messages with the manufacturer and have gotten NO response from them. I see no possible easy way to drain the water since the port is one inch off the floor. I have resorted to putting the unit on a dog kennel tray to prevent the saturation of the surrounding carpet. I would consider selling the item to get rid of it, However, I cannot even begin to imagine the bad feedback I would get from selling this item. Next step is to try returning to original place of purchase since in my opinion the item is defective--it recycles little or no water. Only dumping water on the floor. Good Luck buying this, Buyer Beware!"
1,Leaks a lot of water!,"I installed this unit in a carpeted bedroom. It leaks. I don't mean a few drops, it leaks a LOT of water! The owner's manual states ""Water will accumulate in a holding tank at the bottom of the unit, and the unit will automatically shut off."" WRONG! Yes, the water does accumulate but the unit never shuts off. It overflows until a human shuts it off.The first night I ran this in my bedroom, I awoke to about a 6-foot circle of very wet carpeting. I drained the tank manually (very difficult to do without spilling even more water) and then was stupid enough to try it a second night. The next morning I awoke to a much larger circle of sopping wet carpet.Two days later the company is not returning my calls and the bedroom is starting to smell of mold and mildew. I am afraid this may turn into a very expensive replacement carpet."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT & HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I paid $437.00 for this air conditioner. It worked very well for 30 days and then it began to leak severely. It drenched my carpet! I've been dealing with Soleusair since about mid July and it's been an awful experience. Phone tag...e-mail tag... lots of excuses about their phones being inoperative, and first they asked for copies of receipts (OK that's reasonable) and now I am being asked to provide a tracking number from the shipper (give me a break!). It's obvious that the company's tactic is to harass their disgruntled customers until they give up and go away. I will most likely have to pay about $70.00 to ship this junk back. I will never buy another soleusair product especially over the internet!"
1,Not as Advertised by Producer,"Would never buy this product again, and returning the one I purchased yesterday. It soaked my living room carpet, lets heat back into the room from the window vent - every negative review so far has been right on target. And this is not a cheap A/C! I purchased the unit directly from a major retailer near home, and intend to give a copy of some other purchasers complaints to them when I return the unit on Monday. There are too many major flaws in its design."
4,Does what its suppose to do very well,"I have this unit for over a year (14 months). Bought it at another outfit (Costco) and use it to cool a my basement where I have my computer systems. The unit performs as as described. Keeps the whole area quite cool. Once i accidently set the heat and I can attest that it does that quite well. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it all of a sudden stopped working. Of course, naturally it stopped after the 1 year warranty. Searching for answers and help is almost next to none until I found the reviews here and noticed that the some were saying that the water tray may be full. So I drained it and bingo it started up again without any hesitation. So if it wasn't for the moment of thinking I would have to go out and get another one or find some service center to fix it, and now have to keep an eye out when the water collector gets full, I would have given it a 5 star."
3,Is Not Self-evaporating in Mid Atlantic area,"We are well satisfied with the cooling capacity of our Mac 10 but if you live in a high humidity area do not plan on the unit keeping up with the amount of moisture produced. We were having to empty the very small reserve tank every 2 hours and were getting about 2 cups of water each time. The tap to empty is in a very inconvenient place. We finally drilled a hole in our floor into the basement and attached a hose to it. Now it drains directly into a wash tub in the basement and we empty that into the sump hole every couple of days. Again, the cooling capacity is wonderful and takes care of 3 rooms for us but with our humidity the unit can't keep up with evaporation."
2,perhaps a lemon?,"The unit I received has a few problems:1) It is quite loud. (We have another of the same unit in this building, and it is not nearly as loud.)2) The first weekend I left it turned on, it flooded my office. It has a resevoir to catch the collected humidity, but almost all of it is supposed to be exhausted through the exhaust hose. Our other unit collects perhaps a cup of water per week in the resevoir. This one dumped perhaps four gallons of water onto my desk and onto the floor.3) I'm having a very difficult time with Soleus getting this problem taken care of. They do not return calls; they promise to do things; but nothing has happened yet. It's been a few weeks.I'm not happy."
3,"too long. Good, but 30L is almost 31L","the 30 length I bought is extra long, I would buy 29 instead if it were available!!!"
5,Very good quality and arrived fast,the jeans are a great fit good and feel good. i will def buy again from this seller
1,5 pocket jeans,"Bought these jeans and was disappointed that they had no tool pocket on the right leg. I have no idea what they call the jeans that have them, but these are NOT it!"
5,GREAT RECIPES!!!,"I love to use my smoker, and this book is invaluable. Very good tips on stovetop smoking, and wonderful recipes. Go ahead, USE that smoker you have. You'll have healthful, lowfat tasty meals for everything from vegetables to fish (smoked salmon....mmmmmm....the BEST)."
4,added flavor to foods,"I purchased book in Feb 2011. I would say this is a good book for stove top smokers. Purchased the Cameron stove top smoker and this book is based on that unit, so it goes right along with it. Its the first stove top smoker book i have owned."
3,"if you own one of these smokers, the book is very helpful","The Cameron's tabletop smokers are cool little items. And this book is helpful, at least for those of us new to the smoking world."
2,great ideas,"really like the recipes, gives you ideas on how to smoke food you haven't tried, worked great with our smoker"
2,Disappointed,"Purchased Cameron smoker and used with personal recipes. Purchased this book in the hopes of expanding my repetoire. This cookbook is more about technique with limited recipes for using with the smoker. Too many recipes for side dishes - not enough new recipes or ideas for the smoker, itself."
4,"nice kite, retired U S Air Force",Product seems well built yet flexible which is good for a kite esp when it crashes. It assembles easy and looks nice in flight.
1,For Blinds Only,"Although description says shutter and blind attachment, it won't work for shutters at all. My shutters are small and thin but they are still to big for this attachment."
4,Insightful!,"Stewart D. Friedman and Jeffrey H. Greenhaus conducted extensive research with 861 alumni of the business schools at Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, both in Philadelphia. Their research yielded revealing results about the struggle of professionals to manage work and family commitments. However, Friedman and Greenhaus present these results in such overwhelming statistical detail that the average reader is in danger of being swamped. This is especially the case when the data proves principals that most people already grasp through common sense and experience. That said, we ... recognize that the authors have done working Joes and Janes a great service by aggregating numbers to back up the notion that it's getting tougher to balance family and career. As such, this is an important book for anyone in a position to set workplace policy."
3,he he haaaaa he haa ha,"hey I like track 11..At least I respect Shaq as a Man unlike alot of other Rappers out there in the Main Stream.. you know who im talking about..""go platinum if I buy a million of my own"""

5,this cd is hecka tight!,shaq is the bizzomb. this cd is swoll as heel. i think everybody should buy it because its tight @ night! all you hatas betta stop downin shaq in da rap game or i willl busta cap.
4,Eye-opening!,"I had heard The Mother Knot mentioned and recommended highly in a few other books I've read, including one I read recently that prompted me to order it and read it for myself. It's a short book, but it's packed with eye-opening details that distill and debunk the mother myth. Although written in the mid-1970s, this book feels as fresh as if it were written today, and its insights into the reality of life for new mothers was refreshing and enlightning. I recommend it very highly for every woman, mother or otherwise, and for every man. If it doesn't enlighten you as to your own experience or possible experience, it will awaken you to the reality of mothers everywhere--and to your mother's reality."
3,The good and the bad,"The Good: Easy to use and the mutt (my sweet Doberman, Zoe Washburne) loves it so much she'll go to the refrigerator and hope I get some out for her.The Bad: And this one is ""my bad"" as I was in a hurry and didn't take the time to check out the shipping costs. $6.99 for the roll and $7.99 for the shipping makes sure I'll never order it from these folks again. Not their fault, mine for not looking more closely.A little more Bad: Natural Balance appeared on my list of tainted pet foods and treats. I don't know if the lamb and rice treat was one of the banned items but, guess what?, the dogs doesn't get any more of it until I know for sure it's ok.If I ever get to a store that has it after the pet food scare is over I might pick up a few rolls. Otherwise, no. Just too freakin' expensive to order here."
3,Sasha loves it but.......,"I bought this as a supplement to dry Natural Balance kibble. Though a bit pricey,(I wouldn't spend this much for a good t-bone), I thought I could use it in small amounts, chopped up and mixed with the kibble to stretch it out. Sasha went through the mixture, separated it, left the kibble all over the kitchen floor devouring the meat leaving the kibble untouched. I want Sasha's primary food to be kibble because of her teeth. The mixture is counter productive. End of experiment."
1,Why isn't it working??,I really liked this watch and bought it but unfortunately it stopped working after one month. Emailed the company but haven't had response as of yet. Brialliant!!
1,This movie is a humbug,This is not according to the bible. It's truly a mockery. And God said he can't be mocked. Jesus never flirted with Mary Madgeline. A true movie from the pits of hell.
3,Great,After having made this purchase I realized that I already have this movie. The only complaint that I have is that it did not have a proper case to come with it.
4,Refreshing!,"This movie gives a fresh perspective on the personality of Jesus. We see him learning and growing, having fun with the disciples, and being real. Like all movies on Jesus' life, the writers took some creative license, but overall did not deviate to the point of being untrue to the gospels."
1,This movie is Trash!,"Remenber the words of the Apostle Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit!Galatians 1:6-9 KJV6I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 8But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.My actual review is ZERO Stars!This movie is Trash! It's the same thing as Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code!If you own either of these, throw them out, or better yet burn them!It is blasphemy!"
1,not Biblically accurate enough for me,"i put 1 star because i had to put something, but id rather not rate this movie at all.this movie isnt Biblically accurate enough for me, i would prefer complete and total Biblical accuracy, which seems hard to come by, but aside from just adding non-Biblical scenes, this adds non-Biblical elements to Biblical events, i dont think this movie accuratley portrays Jesus.i dont suggest or recommend this movie."
5,Great and Inspiring!,"I loved this movie when I saw it on CBS a few years ago, and I have since rented and watched it three times. I'm going to buy it to have in my personal video collection.Recently I watched it with critical eyes so that I could take notes and share them with my Sunday School class while we watch it. Sure, there are parts which are not scripturally accurate, but it is a MOVIE afterall. I think that the producers had to dress it up a bit to make it interesting. However, most of the events depicted in the movie can be found in scripture. This movie is great because it adds life to the Biblical characters and really helps you to identify with them and their lives.I cried during the trial and crucifixion...and especially as Christ gives the great command to His Disciples after His resurrection. It is a very spiritually moving movie. Love it!"
5,A Joyful Gospel,"This film shows a joyful and passionate Jesus, a fully human Jesus who is aware of his divinity. Rather than the stiff, somber, two-dimensional character we see too often in Jesus movies, Sisto portrays Jesus as a man who is lovable as well as loving. The departures from scripture (Mary Magdalene as a prostitute and the addition of the ""Lidio"" character) do not significantly detract from the movie's faithful presentation of the Gospel message. The exploration of Judas Iscariot's character as that of a disillusioned revolutionary is thought-provoking and emphasizes the contrast between a loving and a violent revolution."
4,BEST REPRESENATION OF JESUS WE GOT,"This is without a doubt the greatest film about Jesus I have ever seen. Although a few events are out of place, this DVD depicts the very essence of who Jesus really was. Great for the WHOLE family!"
1,What happened?,"When the previews began airing on TV, I thought this would be an excellent new Jesus film to add to my collection. However as I began to watch the film, it became apparent This was not a movie I desired to own. Jesus' uncertainty as of his mission, his mother practically goading him into doing it. John's question to Jesus about did he repent of his sins, was just too much. The many ""liberties"" that were taken of the scriptures. Actually untruths would be better. However it was not all bad though. Jesus' temptation in the wilderness and his prayer in the garden were extremely good, but not good enough to justify the rest of the movie though. Two words ""Extremely Disappointed"""
3,Just another rendition of the greatest story ever told.,"This version of the life of Christ is a bit flashy, There is falseness such as conversations with Satan & his alter ego the Great Harlot. Although this movie is just another altered version of the good book it should move you in someway closer to Jesus. I gave it 3 stars because they added and took from the bible, however the message still remains the same. Sisto did a fine job and played his part emotionally however there were things in this movie that I believe Jesus did not do or say. As a Christian I recommend the 1979 version of Jesus to non-belivers and the saved alike because it is probably the most accurate crossover of the bible."
1,Blasphemy! Mockery!!,"This is blasphemous. I didn't finish watching it and I am throwing it away. What part I saw was Jesus being portrayed as a sinner, yelling at Heavenly Father to do it now (raise Joseph from dead), confused as to who he is and more stupidity. It is a mockery of the Lord of Lords and King of Kings."
3,Makes Jesus Seem Like A Friend,"I enjoyed the movie. I think that it was a good movie to introduce my younger children to Jesus, making him seem like a person who could be a friend. Now that does not mean that I think it is accurate. No one really knows how Joseph and Jesus got along, the Bible is silent on that issue, probably because it is not that imporatant. He was probably devoted to Joseph as most sons would be with their fathers, so they took a little liberty, but I don't think that it was a bad thing. No it does not follow scripture (no evidence Jesus was interested in Mary, John the Baptist knew full well who Jesus was before he baptized him etc...) but any movie that will get people interested in the Lord is good as long as it does not desecrate him (having sex, girlfriends etc, being a mook etc). I liked it, but if you want more accuracy look to Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings etc..., this movie is more kid friendly."
1,Not from the gospel,"There were just too many deviations from the bible. I had to stop the film and throw it in the trash after 20 minutes. Firstly, there was no mention of Jesus being a 30 year old man living with his parents, not knowing the purpose of his life. Secondly, when the scene where he and John met is just complete fiction. Also, Jesus came out of the water. He was fully immersed when he was baptised. Here its shows them getting sprinkled on their face. I don't know why it is hard to find an accurate film? Anyway, if you are looking for accuracy, do not bother with this film."
1,Absolutely the worst depiction of Jesus I have ever seen,"I can barely find the words. This film is AWFUL!! Scripturally it is woefully unsound. They have taken the concept of ""artistic license"" to levels that are frightening. I could not watch more than a few minutes of it before I felt compelled to eject the disc. The way Martha, Mary, and Lazarus were portrayed was absolute fantasy and is so far from scriptural accuracy it was sickening to watch - Mary was shown to be romantically in love with Jesus, and Lazarus rebukes Jesus and insists that he tell Mary his true feelings for her. I continued to watch in disbelief but could stand no more when they showed Jesus ""praying"" in the tomb of his deceased father Joseph, begging God to raise Joseph up because he just couldn't go on without him. It was pitiful. I believe this film borders on blasphemy.... and that might be an understatement. Repugnant - I would have given it zero stars, but that option was not available."
2,Not a good movie,"This movie was okay, but not as good as I expected. I like the words that were easy to understand-no thees or thous-just plain language, but it had a lot to be desired as it was missing any real interest, kind of boring to me. It definately was missing the real story of Jesus, like the king of kings, this movie showed lack of the purpose."
4,Jesus (1999) Starring Jeremy Sisto,"This is a great Jesus film, suitable for young teenagers to the elderly. There are some good talking points as well as some humour in the film. Great performances. If you are looking for a way to bring the Jesus story into modern times, without losing the Scripture, this film does do that quite effectively. Definitely worth a look!"
1,Jesus Didn't Know Who He Was In This Movie,"This a very inacurate version of Jesus life on earth. In the movie Jesus doesn't know why he came to earth in the first place. He didn't know he was God's son. And it was Mary who had to tell Jesus what to do.And what is this about John asking Jesus to confess his ""SINS"" and Jesus says ""OKAY."" Jesus didn't have any sins. He was PERFECT.And in the movie John didn't know Jesus was the Messiah.In the Bible John knew Jesus was the Messiah right when he laid eyes on him and said ""I am the one needing to be baptised by you."" (Mat 3:14)Where did you get the information for this Movie? Use The Bible Next Time.I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.It's all Fake on who Jesus really was as a person."
1,"TOTALLY RIDICULOUS, ABSURD. AN INSULT TO THE BIBLE AND THE ""REAL"" SAVIOR!","I'm not going to waste much time here. Leave it to say, this film is a complete lie/ mockery of scripture. Anyonewho is associated with this abomination of a production should be ashamed of themselves. If someone had offered me 100 million dollars to be part of this discusting tripe, I would turn them down flat! I never made it through a full viewing. Here's one of the reasons...Jesus is taken out of the town by his mother, Mary. Once alone, Mary tells her grown son who he really is. In response to this revelation, her son screams out in despair, ""WHY ME? WHY ME!!???""In scripture it's clear that Christ Jesus knew of this when he was 12 years old. He wasn't given this information by Mary, and as God incarnate, he knew who he was. Anyone wanting to see a more acurate film of The Lord, then watch a film entitled, ""The Jesus Project"", or ""The Jesus Film"". God Bless."
1,Fit to be rated as one of the worst Jesus movies ever,"This movie is created by and for those people who do not give an inch of importance to the Word of God and to Holiness. Please do not waste money on buying this rubbish. If you want a good Jesus movie I recommend ""Gospel of John"", Visual Bible- Mathew, Jesus of Nazareth. God bless you."
1,Not Based On the Bible At All,"If you want a movie that shows the human side of Christ while remaining faithful to the actual Scriptures (word-for-word) I would suggest the Visual Bible - Matthew.This made-for-TV miniseries starring Jeremy Sisto is dangerously unbiblical and, what's worse, much of the man-made inventions aren't benign at all, but contain seeds of falsehood that undermine or downright deny the divinity of Christ.Jesus was indeed fully man, but make no mistake...He was also fully God."
1,I'd rather watch 6 hours of Jesus of Nazareth,"This movie is an abomination to the story of Jesus. First of all, the actor who plays Jesus has a permananent flirtatious lusty expression on his face. The story is not all true to the bible. It was so horrid that my friend and I who decided together to rent it, had to shut it off halfway through. If you truly want a movie that pays homage to Jesus's life, watch Jesus of Nazareth instead!"
2,"this is okay - Matthew, the visual Bible is much more accurate","although i have nothing against ANY movie that shares the gospel, which is the most important thing a person can possibly understand and accept, this video has a slight angle to it that got a little too affectionate between Jesus and some woman who knew him before he was baptised in the Holy Spirit. like maybe he had a girlfriend but then the time of his mission was upon him so he had to go a different direction. lol! so, if you're looking for a good Gary Oldman movie get Sid and Nancy (then burn it) but if you're looking for an accurate and entertaining AND well-made dvd with Jesus in it, get the Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew Starring Richard Kiley."
4,the human side of Jesus,"This miniseries is most affective in showing the human side of Jesus. Once you watch you find yourself wanting to read the gospel to know more about Him. Spotlighting Him growing up, being baptised by John the baptist, playing with children, picking his disciples, to his death on the cross is riveting and it holds your attention. The supporting cast is great especially Debra Messing as Mary Magdelene. I can watch this over and over again."
1,Contradicting of the word,"From the very beginning of this movie it was very misleading, not only that, but Christ knew his purpose here on earth, Mary his mother did not have to instruct him of his requirements by his heavenly Father. Remember he was separated from Mary and Joseph while they continued traveling not knowing he was back in the temple speaking to the men there with great wisdom and he was only 12 years old. I need not see anymore nor say anymore, but I did not like this movie at all! Lies"
1,The Absolute Worst!,"This movie is the most disappointing adaptation of the story of Jesus Christ I have ever witnessed. Something about Jesus talking in a 21st century, flippant American dialect is disturbing. It had no authentic feel. We could handle the older classics getting away with removing Jesus and the characters in the story from their Jewishness and their native culture, but this one failed miserably. You would fare better with Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings or The Greatest Story Ever Told. At least the actors, although many guilty of the same lack of cultural authenticity, delivered with passion and reverence...."
1,An Absolutely Appalling Rendition of the Son of God,"This movie was absolutely abominable. I watched about the first five minutes of it. Basically, it starts out with two of the disciples grumbling and telling each other to shut up. Then Jesus comes out from praying and they all hush. He walks down the hill a little ways to where the crowds are waiting and asks them ""What is it that would make you happy in life?"" and someone says ""a big house!"" with a greedy look on his face and then Jesus LAUGHS. He laughs! Yeah right! Considering the fact that Jesus completely condemned the love of money, I CANNOT see Him doing something like this.Apparently, the writers of this movie didn't bother to stop and consult the Bible before they wrote the script. Whatever you do, don't buy this movie- the only thing that it's good for is to layer the bottom of your garbage can."
1,The worst movie I ever saw,"I almost can't even bring words to explain just how awful and what a waste of time watching this movie was. The personality given to Jesus was inaccurate, antiscripture, and gross."
1,DON'T WATCH IT!,I watched 5 minutes of it and had to turn it off because it was so incredibly biblically incorrect and insulting to Jesus. This movie degrades Jesus and makes him out to be who he is definately not. This movie will infuriate you if you are a believer and it will deter non believers to incorrect ideas. I highly discourage anybody from watching it.
4,Touching interpretation of Jesus,"I loved this film. I am giving it four stars because more emphasis could have been put upon the resurrection scenes. How refreshing to see Jesus portrayed as human with the same feelings and needs that we all experience, yet also divine, with the insights of the Almighty. I was touched by the scene where he grieves for his earthly father, Joseph - Jesus truly understands how we feel when someone we love dies! This interpretation of Jesus' life intended to emphasize his humanity and it did so beautifully. Watch this movie and glean from it some fresh insights into Jesus' life."
3,"good visuals, sketchy insides","The movie is a good visual representation of some the accounts of Jesus, but also tends to insert many extra-canonical thoughts and ideas."
1,Not the Jesus I know,"Gee, I never envisioned Jesus as lazy. This guy mumbles through the dialog and seems annoyed that he is even in the movie. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy ""Jesus of Nazareth."" It is by far the best movie about the life of Christ I have ever seen.By the way, Jesus is my savior. I hope he is yours too!"
3,Satan Steals the show.,"This is a fair and semi modern type of adaption of the story of Jesus. It takes quite a bit of artist license but does what it sets out to do. With one exception it is a B movie in general and a medicore adaption of the life of Jesus.......That exception is the temptation scenes particularly the temptation in the Garden. It was the most riviting moment of any adaption of the life of Christ I've ever seen. Jeroen Krabbe plays the best Satan I have ever seen. The final temptation is of couse taken with artistic licence but we have no idea how it was. Turning Christ's request to have the cup pass from him into a grand temptation sequence was brilliant. It hits the viewer where it counts playing on Christ's love for man that is oft not returned, and his love for the father which allows him to carry on. It is almost a reason to give the picture a fourth star.Almost."
1,If this was God then he's gotta lot of explaining to do.,"I would love to ask the producers of this flick, did you guys discover a new Bible or new Gospels that nobody else has heard of when your were making this mockery of a movie?I can state with complete confidence that this was hands down absolutely the worst protrayal of Christ I have ever seen. Jesus confessing his ""sins"" before John the Baptist is just the tip of the iceberg. This horrifying travesty is so riddled with inaccuracies and distortions of the Scriptures that in its own perverse way it is a monumental achievement.Please, please, please I beg you gentle reader, buy Franco Zefferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" instead. Made in 1977, it is a work of art of the highest caliber."
1,Blasphemous and Ridiculous,A high production value and famous Hollywood actors can't change the blasphemous and ridiculous nature of this movie! And why did the Nazis come out in this film? This is nothing but made-for-television trash.
4,I left my home out on the rural route.,"This is a collection of demos by Hank Williams. Just Hank's voice and guitar, with occasional vocal assistance by another person or two. A few of Hank's big hits are here, but most of the demos are of lesser known songs, many of which he never commercially recorded. This collection is a real treasure for fans of Hank Williams."
5,Cajun music comes to life.,"I was looking for ""Christine Balfa"" music and came across this CD. It flows form lively track to lively track as it pulls you into the music. As far as Cajun Music goes this CD is on the top of the list. This is one disk you don't want to miss."
2,Just a waste,"Hi,I purchased this book, and found out I had wasted my money (by my own fault, i will admit). There is nothing in this book that is useful. Dissappointing...."
4,Great resource tool,"I have a small wedding business and found this book very helpful. It is a very simple short book but it is loaded with great ideas for weddings and receptions. Pictures are excellent, lots of new ideas to try, I would recommend it as a resource guide and was very happy to receive it as a gift off my wish list."
4,Big Things Come In Small Packages,"A cute-sized book chockful of ideas! Creative ideas on favor packaging, table settings, floral arrangements. Inspirational ideas that can be easily adapted to your budget and style."
4,Fabulous Chocolate Cake Recipe,"The chocolate cake recipe is amazing. I don't usually like chocolate cake but this one was great. Easy to make, and we've made them 3 times since September. No problems.The book is more about decorating than the recipes. I'm not a baker I just play at it so finding a great recipe is a bonus.I hated the white cake recipe. Mine turned out tough and inedible. So I've only given the book a 4 star.Try the chocolate cake."
2,dissapointed,Actually theres not much there to help me with the wedding .I thought that it will have a lot of ideas and pictures of very nice stuff to make for the wedding not so .
2,Great Bike Once You Replace the Shifter & Deraileur,"Pros: Cheap Bike. Cons: Won't Shift! I got this bike for my 7 year old for Christmas. I put it together in about 30 minutes, but the bike wasn't shifting very well. I am a bike enthusiast and work on my and my wife's road bikes, so I know a bit about adjusting shifting. I put the bike on a stand and got to work. I worked for 2 hours but was never able to get it to shift properly. It was also VERY hard to turn the shifter. After about an hour, the cable would just kink up in the handlebar. I took the bike to my local shop and they could not get it to work much better than I. Rather than deal with returning the bike, I had the shop change the deraileur and handlebar shifter to a SRAM unit. Total cost for this with labor was $[...]. Now it shifts great. If you're looking for an out-of-the-box bike, this ain't it. If you're willing to replace some stuff, it's still cheaper than buying it from a bike shop."
3,As apt a name for an album as I've ever seen...,"Other reviewers have pointed out some of the flaws of the album - shoddy production, most notably - and I can't dispute that; the album isn't really much of a progression from VoiVod's first, War and Pain.That said, it is simply a brutal, hammering piece of old-school thrash metal; VoiVod's stylistic leaps forward would occur in spade on their next two recordins - Killing Technology and Dimension Hatross - but sometimes you don't need intelligent, inventive alterna-metal; sometimes all you need is a basic, raw explosion of riffage, and RRROOOAAARRR delivers that in spades."
4,Great for colicky babies,"Our daughter was experiencing terrible colic for a few weeks until we switched to this formula. After being on Alimentum for one full week, her disposition changed drastically. She was no longer as fussy/colicky all the time and was a much happier baby. She seems to really like this formula. Also, it does not bubble up when you shake it like Similac Sensitive does (what she was on before) so it's good for very gassy babies as well. The only downsides are: (1) the price, and (2) it smells awful when prepared and therefore so does everything else if your baby spits up a lot like ours does. But because she's doing so well, we're sticking with it!"
5,Good formula,This formula can be a huge benifit to the babies that suffere from a cow milk protein allergy. My baby was so miserable until this formula. For all the mommies out there who have health insurance. Try getting your doctor to write you a prescription for it and then take that to your pharmacy. I did that and the pharmacy has to order it in (which only takes 2 days). I get a case (6 cans) for 1 copay. It is basiclly like buying 1 and getting 5 free. This is worth a try.
3,great product- why did you raise the price?,"I have twins and have to use this formula to feed them due to a sever allergy. Why oh why? have you raised the price $7 in the past month?????The people who use this formula do so because they have to, not out of choice- there are numerous high quality choices in formula that are much cheaper- BUT if they make your baby vomit severely for hours on end, we cannot use them. Alimentum is a pricey food for baby but if it works we pay it. Why did you have to raise the price Amazon? IT's bad enough we have to deal with this issue and the price of formula in general (I breastfed as long as possible but my milk has dried up- trust me, I tried everything).Do we have to be gouged in addition to the other issues we face with children with allergies?"
4,A miracle!,"Alimentum has been a miracle for us, as my daughter was having severe reactions to several other formulas. Giving 4 stars because it's expensive and because it smells funny (although the baby doesn't seem to mind). And neither of those things really matter when your child is not fussy after eating, does not have stomach problems, and is all around happier because of what they are eating. If your child has a protein sensitivity, buy this ASAP."
2,A can was opened!,One can out of the six was already open and had to be thrown out. Also a couple other cans the powdered seemed discolored so we were nervous to give it to our child.
4,Good Formula,"This was the formula we were using and it was cheaper to order it on AMAZON by the case then to buy it at the store. It arrived at our house very quickly, and kept very well. Would recommend this product to all."
5,NO DENTED CANS,This is the only formula my grandson has ever drank. I think it is a really good formula as he doesn't have any problems. I was most concerned about not getting dented cans. They arrived in perfect condition. I am also saving about $5 per can by buying this formula from Amazon. That's $30. I highly recommend.
1,What is with this ridiculous price???,"In all seriousness most people MUST buy this formula because their baby is allergic to milk and soy. So, on top of the ridiculous GI Specialist bills and pediatric visits (too many to count) that we have to pay (or co-pay) to get to this diagnosis, we're getting ripped off by this price. I can buy it cheaper in the store with coupons at this rate. The price has easily gone up $30 for a case of six since I first started purchasing it six months ago. Boo sellers! Shame on you! By the way, my insurance does NOT cover this formula, I've tried three times and was denied, so thanks for the price hikes."
2,"Like the product, but arrived in damaged packaging",I need this formula for my daughter who is allergic to dairy and soy. Picked this over equivalent Enfamil product based on various reviews I've read. Only complaint is that 3 of the 6 cans came severely dented.
5,Cheaper when you buy in bulk,Larger upfront cost but cheaper than the market in the long run especially when your infant eats like mine!
2,alimentum,"This is not the answer to eczema. My baby has severe eczema. We have tried soy-based and now this hydrolyzed formula. No improvement in eczema whatsoever. Only some allergic reactions are caused by cow milk protein, so don't listen to your doc when he says switching formula is one thing you have to do.And this formula is so expensive! But it does nothing..."
4,This is a great product,"I was soo happy to have found this milk,when my baby was born she would cry endless nights due to colic,I try different milks and none of them would work. So I began to search the Internet and found this product , I purchased it and it was the answer to my problem, as soon as my baby started to drink this milk I immediately notice the difference,my baby is 6 months now and I plan to continue feeding her with this milk, the only thing it is a little pricey but I found a good deal here in Amazon."
5,Delivery very soon,"Hi everyone, just want to say that the product arrived in only two weeks, and the quality is very high, this is exactly what i'm looking for."
2,Only true american sports,"The concept of the book is nice, and the authors are quite funny, but the book deals only with american sports. If by chance the author does write about other sportts played the world over, he mentions only american players. If you're looking to learn something about non american sports, please skip this one."
4,works just OK,This gadget is somewhat difficult to use as it tends to knock down more dust than it vacuums up.
4,Glitz & Glitter,"Joan Collins has taken a great deal of flack over her novels, but for me, her books always deliver the expected punch: glitz, glitter, glamour and gossip, things one would expect from a glamorous international superstar such as Joan. Misfortune's Daughters doesn't explore any new territory from her other bestselling titles Prime Time, Love & Desire & Hate, Infamous and Star Quality, as the novel chronicles the incredible lives of two vastly different sisters born into amazing privilege but who both suffer the hard knocks of the fabulously wealthy. You won't lose any sleep discovering what happens to siblings Atlanta and Venetia as they cross the globe searching for love and acceptance, but you certainly will have an entertaining time reading about their misadventures in a glamourous world that exists only between the pages of one of Joan's novels."
3,She never said she was Shakespeare!,"Joan did a fairly good job with this book but I kept finding myself wishing for better continuity. It was hard to keep my attention and the story wasn't nearly as good as say ""Star Quality"". Maybe one of these days she'll release the two books she was sued over because any fan of ""Dynasty"" could tell you that ""Hell Hath No Fury"" like Joan Collins scorned!"
3,Good Beach Read,"If you're looking for ""serious"" reading, pass this one up. It's strictly fluffy, breezy, easily digested poolside/airplane reading. The characters are neither sympathetic nor realistic; they are simply puppets in a fantasy world that doesn't really exist, no matter how rich you are. This is the type of novel that you'll read and immediately forget.Joan Collins is nailing her kid sister Jackie's writing downpat a little bit harder with each novel. Same people, same places, same story."
4,se ve bien,"el libro se ve bastante interesante, aborda los temas de los PLL, que utilizan para generar frecuencias bastante altas, estos dispositivos son utilizados en los sistemas celulares."
4,Learning the Stages of Leadership,"This is an excellent book which guides the reader through the various stages of leadership in preparation for reigning. Oftentimes one finds oneself facing challenges. These challenges are often misinterpreted as clues that one is not destined for leadership or to reign. This book destroys those fallacies. It helps you to see the tradegies and mistakes in your life as preparation for reigning and necessary for your continued success. If you have ever wondered whether or not you are destined for leadership, this book will help you discover the answer."
1,"Fraudulent description, it is only 500mg Chitosan!","The description of this product and the front of the label, which says ""Chitosan Plus 1300 mg"", is just pure fraud. The actual Chitosan content per capsule is just 500 mg. For that content it is overpriced. Stay away!"
1,Gave me horrible stomach pain,I really wanted this product to work. I was willing to try it for a few months to give it a fair chance. Unfortunately on the first day and consequently for the next seven I had the most horrible stomach cramps. I gave it a week to allow my body to adjust to it but it never did.
1,not good,"I did not like this product as I used it and it made me sick! Stopped up my digestion. Buyer beware, not healthy! I returned for a refund. This is why I buy from Amazon they are good about their refunds!"
2,A Little Boring.,"At some point in this book, one of the teenagers gets separated from the rest of his ship mates because a rope breaksand he is the last one in the dinghy. The tides swiftly move him away from the boat and the book revolves aroundtrying to find him again. Except it's always foggy so the search is hindered.While the search is on, our lone teen Tom finds himself on an island and then the book becomes something like a guide tosurviving on an island. Except this island has fresh water, and lobster, mussels and clams. Not to mention Strawberriesand Blueberries.. Plus a big beach with all the firewood a person could want..Just where is this island and how do I get there?The Captain comes off as Gilligan and about as adept but I'll let you read the book without spoiling it for you.This book also features sea-glish, that strange jargon of people who don't use vowels. It's poorly done here."
2,Cheaply made case,"The art set itself was nice, with a good selection of colors and paints, however the case was very cheap and poorly made."
3,Its ok,"It's fine for a kid to use, the pencils are not that good, but it gets the work done. Don't use the top for the water paint, or they will fall off after a while."
3,about what i expected,"the set is about what i expected. somehow in my mind i expected it to be larger, but it had everything that was listed. the only thing that i was disappointed by was the the handle was a metal arc, and not leather. the leather would have really made the presentation better."
1,Misrepresented! Worth $10 (Being Generous),I just got this in the mail today... Hoping to have a nice set for my daughter for Christmas. Cheap Cheap Cheap... and small! I would have rather made an airplane out of a fifty dollar bill and threw it out the window of my car while driving to work.I wish I wouldn't have purchased this set on 12/15 (before all the negative reviews showed up)Sickening...
1,very dissapointed,"I was stunned when I recieved this item. it was tiny,and the case was the only half way descent part of it. could have purchased the items inside from the dollar store. TOTAL RIPOFF"
3,Didn't send what I saw online.,The kit came and was different than the one pictured. I saw the exact kit at AC Moore for $20 that they sent me in lieu of the one pictured online at Amazon. I could have saved $30 by buying at AC Moore.
4,Impressive for the price.,"Admittedly, this was purchased for a younger artist, but I didn't want something that would appear cheap. My son was so impressed with it that he spent most of the day telling his much older brother and sister to be careful with it. He then promptly sat down and started drawing sketches with the Art Set from a book purchased seperately for him.The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is that it was sent out of state as a gift, and I didn't see it myself. His reaction was described by the older sister."
4,good book,"it took me a while 2 get into this book,but im soooooo glad i read it.ok so 1rst amy cant seem 2 get any where with the new arrival venture,and then she finds out that ben is leaving heartland.lou begins 2 get irritated at nancy but no one knows why until amy talks 2 her.and then a new stable hand joni comes 2 take bens place.she fits in really well and even manges 2 give amy some ideas on how 2 help venture."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A quickly-put-together and unconvincing version of Krakauer's amazing book, Into Thin Air (and other movies like it, obviously) is the reason why ""TV movie"" is a pejorative term; rewriting real people to make heroes and villains and condensing everything into a tidy 100 minute block, Into Thin Air is depressingly bad."
3,Worth watching,"OK, this isn't a great movie, but it's not as bad as some reviews here make it out to be. Given the huge cast of characters on the mountain, you can't expect in-depth characterization of everybody!I thought the casting was excellent, and captured the essence of what each of the participants was like (at least in the somewhat one-dimensional view that Krakauer's book gives). A better movie could have been made about the tragedy, with a different point of view from the book, but a film of Krakauer's book (especially as a TV-movie quickie), isn't going to be Oscar material... they did a competent job, and I enjoyed watching it.Rent it. Read the book (better, read a *great* book about mountaineering challenges and tragedies, like Heinrich Harrer, The White Spider.)"
3,Fair account of the book; could have been more development,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster (had a rent one, get one coupon) and was very anxious to see it. If there ever was a book that should not have been attempted as a made-for-TV movie, this is it. If Titanic deserves 3 1/2 hours, Into Thin Air deserves at least 2. Too much had to be left out, and the editing required for TV viewing caused it to lose some credibility. See the IMAX film instead."
3,Decent Watch,"I watched this when it first aired on television. It was interesting enough that I went out and bought the book. After Reading ""Into Thin Air"" three times, I will say the book is a more captivating attention getter."
1,Not worth the film it was printed on,"A complete work of fiction which strayed FAR from any of the printed accounts, including Krakauer's own book. Good thing I only paid $3 for the rental!!"
1,Poor attempt at documenting an Everest endeavor.,"This movie did NOT capture the story told in Krakauer's book or Boukriev's account of the events. Since it didn't follow either of these author's accounts as described in their books, or the IMAX movie version for that matter, we could only hope that it would accurately depict what an endeavor like an Everest summit assault was like. Nope! It failed to address or adequately portray the material issues one encounters when considering an Everest summit assault. Ok, maybe the portrail of the participants would be entertaining. Nope! The development of the characters in the film was very shallow. In summary, the film had very little to offer. A waste of time. Read Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"", AND Boukreev's ""The Climb"", both describe the events of May 10, 1996 on Mt. Everest."
3,Good Story... Poor Sound Quality,"I picked up this DVD for my class after we read ""Into Thin Air"". For the most part, the class enjoyed it... however the Sound Quality - especially between cut scenes - was quite poor. Sometimes the background and sound effects were louder than the dialogue which became annoying.Story/Movie - 4/5Quality - 3/5Sound - 1/5"
2,Does the book no justice,Loved the book but the movie was so cheesy. The main actor who played Jon Krakauer was completely unbelievable and it made it seem like Jon was a bigger hero than he was. It also conveniently painted characters like Sandy or the Russian in shades of deep black and light white and no shades of gray in-between. Really hated it after reading the book in a day or two.
1,Hollywood at it's worst,"Bad MoviePlease . . . a little less SHOW BIZ and more EVEREST? The video gave an account of the recent deaths of 5 climbers on Everest. With such a good plot, how could they fail so misserably! There is not 5 Minutes of Everest shots in the whole movie. This stinks!"
2,Poor movie,"Into Thin Air:Death On Everest~1997I'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story. If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot:In May 1996, writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world's highest and most infamous mountain. Krakauer was one of the lucky ones, he made it back alive- 12 people didn't."
1,Worse than the Book,"During the first five minutes of this book it is painfully obvious that it is a very low budget film. They couldn't even get the landmarks right on the Everest map. Clothing and gear is wrong. Sequence of events and factual reconstruction isn't even close. At one point they have Krakuer striking out in a blizzard on the South Col to rescue stranded climbers, only to have a sherpa beg him to abandon his efforts. The facts show and even by Krakuers own admission he was sleeping in his tent and refused any participation in rescue efforts. This film will make you ill if you have a grasp of the facts."
2,"Cheap, a little nasty, and that's a shame.","Based on the infamous events of the 1996 season, this made for tv show isn't compelling. Mostly that's because it's cheap and it shouldn't have been. The story is interesting, but the main problem is that it just doesn't ever feel like they're actually climbing a mountain. It's like the screenwriters tried to write a movie about climbing Everest without bothering to research what climbing Everest is actually like. Even I could have done a better job.2 out of 5."
1,What a shame.,"Read the book. I agree with the negative aspects of some of the reviewers, such as, given how this film was made, I could not really care about what happened to most of the people, although there were a few positive aspects of the making this film. For example, the dialogue, when I could hear it, was spare, even terse, no nonsense, which seems to fit the strenuous physical (and mental) exertion of the climb up and the descent---no time, energy, thought for hyperbole.The most annoying thing about the film, for me however, was the music, which was so loud---and I fear uninteresting, uninspired---that often I could not hear what anyone was saying. I had to sit up close and listen carefully to hear what the actors were saying. The point is that the musical score itself was not a good enough reason to watch this film to the bitter end. I was happy that I had read the book first. So, again I say, read the book."
3,Decent adjunct to the book,"Saw this after reading the book and also seeing the PBS doc Storm Over Everest. It's a semi-cheesy tv movie, but does have some strengths, including some decent climbing scenes. It's funny to watch McDonald play Krakauer, as he's always the villain in so many B-movies. He does a good job as the author here, but the biases of the book are repeated and there are some overly sharp portraits drawn, especially of Fischer, who comes off as more of a jerk than in the book. Too much happened up there to squueze into 90 minutes of drama, seems like; this feels too compressed.Worth seeing if you've read the book, otherwise the PBS doc is far superior."
1,Terrible,"This movie was the worst depiction of anything Everest.The book Into Thin Air is so much better.Watch the IMAX version and you'll see what I mean.Why is it that movies with stupid plots,like oh say...Saving Private Ryan(though a good movie)always are turned into Hollywood smashes,and movies with great plots,like Into thin air,are made into TV bad movies?Why cant Spielberg make a version of Into Thin Air with Jon Krakauer as the main character?Anyway,don't even think about laying hands on this one,pray for a *Good* Hollywood movie of everest,and buy the books."
4,"Good, Unknown Movie","This is not a tipical John Wayne movie. He plays the builder of a railroad thru the Andes Mountains. He feels the biggest problem he has is his boss, the father of Laraine Day, who he marries in this movie. However, it takes the rest of the film for the Duke to discover that his biggest enemy is himself. Recommened."
3,Typical Duke,"I gave this three because its not one of his best but still enjoyable,Wayne still shows his in charge in this film but it needed more action to fulfill the satisfaction of die hard Wayne fans.All in all still worthwhile buying for your John Wayne collection."
5,Tycoon,"I have just finished viewing the movie Tycoon with John Wayne and Laraine Day and found it very entertaining. The video was in excellent shape and so was it case.For a new twist on the ""Duke"" try watching this movie."
2,Add a half-star for the supporting cast...,"Not the best vehicle for the Duke, but he tries to give it some flair. Supporting actors Anthony Quinn, Paul Fix, and James Gleason have better moments than co-stars Larraine Day, Cedric Hardwicke and Judith Anderson. This one is set in South America, where Wayne is in charge of building a railroad for tycoon Hardwicke, but when the Duke romances the daughter, hostilities between Cedric and John become not just project-threatening, but life-threatening as well. There is a nice sequence of a locomotive on a bridge in a huge storm, but overall, it seems to be flat and not well-written or directed. Most of the South American backdrop looks fake. Unless you are a John Wayne fanatic, this is one you can miss without regret."
2,Nice Color But Dull John Wayne Flick!,"I'm a big John Wayne fan, have more DVDs with him in them than those with any other actor. This one put me to sleep though! Very nice Technicolor, lovely on location South American scenery, competent performances from the Duke and a good supporting cast but it just drags, especially in the first half of the film. Even if you're a major Wayne fan as I am and want to see everything he made I'd save my money and wait until this one plays again on Turner Classic Movies. Big disappointment in my humble opinion! The entertaining short and cartoon were better than the feature!"
3,Action hero John Wayne...,"...throws off a lot of heat as a romantic leading man. He and Laraine Day look beautiful together, and any gal could imagine succumbing to Wayne's considerable charm and good looks. Far from a romance only, there is plenty of thrilling action in the last quarter of the film, in which Wayne shows his chops as an action hero as well. The complete package movie star, Wayne is well supported by an accomplished cast, especially James Gleason as Wayne's loyal partner and Cedric Hardwicke as Day's creepy father. The film drags a bit in spots, but is well worth watching. Don't miss this ladies, I bet the Duke will give you the vapors."
4,More of a Story.,"BROWN RABBIT'S DAY is the first book in Baker's rabbit books that I have read that is more of a story than a book used to teach a concept. I guess the book does illustrate the concept of time somewhat since in almost every scene, Brown Rabbit's alarm clock can be seen showing the passage of time. But, the clock really doesn't have anything to do with anything else in the story. Basically Brown Rabbit is having a party for his friends and he has to get everything set up. He makes some jello. Then his friends arrive. They play some games and then they go home. Then Brown Rabbit lays down and goes to sleep. End of story. Children will enjoy looking through this book, but since it doesn't really have any lesson or concept to teach, I find that the book isn't quite as good as some of the other ones in the series. But, it's still one children enjoy."
1,Don't buy a Jell-O advertisement,"A book about a rabbit that makes Jell-O (purple, yellow, green, and red, to be exact). Most pages of the story talk about Jell-O. Give me a break. Why would I ever read this to my kids? Why use my precious time with my kids to fill their minds with garbage about brand-name sugary junk? I threw the book away."
2,2 locks out of 4 no longer open after one year,"I purchased 4 Samsonite Travel Sentry 4-dial Combo locks because of the Samsonite name. After using three of them less than 5 times, two will no longer open. I am thankful that they did not break while I had my suitcase full and locked because by calling customer service, they advised me that the only way to open the lock was to bring the suitcase down to TSA so they could unlock it. I am sure TSA will be delighted to help. If I had reached my destination and been unable to get to my clothing, my vacation would have been affected negatively."
1,Does not work,What a piece of garbage. I was able to open it via the default 000 combo. But the lock did not take the new combination. Going back to 000 didnt work. What a piece.This truly deserves a zero
1,Junk - so presumably are all Samsonite products,"A piece of rubbish. Like everyone else, I bought on on the basis of the Samsonite name (such as it was). It opens, but now will not close. I didn't buy it on Amazon but in a shop. I'll follow this up with Samsonite direct and get them to send me a decent one or else it's the small claims court. For goodness sake, don't buy any lock from this poor company."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"1) The TSA removes these locks in order to inspect your baggage. They often forget to put the locks back on. The TSA will NOT reimburse you if this happens. So, you will be out the money you paid for the lock AND your luggage will still go thru transport unlocked. No one wins2) These locks are easily damaged. The number dials get smashed in making them impossible to turn. In most cases you will have to cut the lock off in order to open your bag.We bought FOUR of these locks for vacation and only ONE made it home from vacation. One of the locks was damaged to the point we had to cut it off and the other two locks were lost in transport (they were on the bags when we left them at the departing airport, but were missing when we picked the bags up)."
1,They Pinch like Crazy!,"I got these for my wife. They earrings are beautiful, especially for the price, but they pinch like crazy, really HURTING her ears. Unfortunately, there are no insturctions on how to adjust them, so I did my best, got it too loose, and she lost one!"
3,mismatched,"The stones have good color, and the earrings feel substantial. However, one earring had bright, almost white, silver color; while the other was tarnished. I used Wright's Silver Polish which helped except for the crevices."
3,ok but not the best,"I love the bumper sticker, but it is not surviving well on my bumper - after about 6 months on the car I could see wear and now at over a year I can see I will need to replace it soon. Not as long lasting as most bumper stickers."
4,Close but no Cigar,"This CD contains all the Webb Pierce classics when he was a true country star which is why I purchased it. It's too bad they didn't cut off about 5 songs in which he feebly attempted a crossover to country rock so to speak. If you want Webb at his country music best, pass this one by."
4,Great review above,One of the best short album reviews I've ever read above. Perfectly put. This album is a fantastic debut. Can't wait for the next one.
5,Heavenward,Denis Audet died Nov. 2007. I had the pleasure of meeting this man in the mid-80's. He truly was a man of God. The information in this book is more advanced in Christian maturity than many books these days. A lot could be learned from Denis Audet's writings. I hope that some publisher will pick up this book so that other can be blessed by it.
4,Very Thorough Glimpse at Glimpses of Jack the Ripper,"Denis Meilke has managed to make a very thorough examination of the myriad and varied appearances of Jack the Ripper in movies and television quite an entertaining book. This is a remarkable feat as he details every thing from the times ""Ripper"" is used in the title of a direct-to-video motion picture to make the mere suggestion of Jack the Ripper to the times when the historical figure makes the bizarre leap into the future on a television show, such as his appearance on the original Star Trek, as well, of course, on the movies based directly on the actual crimes, such as From Hell. Through all of this, the author gives descriptions of the movies, both as entertainment and as ways of seeing the true history of the crimes. The reader will learn much of interest and be amused by the author's opinions."
5,MOM PhD,"Teresa Bell Kindred uses her lifelong interest in leadership, and 24 years of experience as a wife and mother to five children to create a simple plan for success--incorporating biblical wisdom, common sense and recognized leadership skills.An easy and entertaining read, Mom PhD puts forth a simple six-step plan to managing your family in a positive and creative way. Each step outlines a characteristic Teresa consider scritical in leading your family--including integrity, love, diligence, wisdom, vigor and faith.Every chapter includes an applicable ""case study"" from the Bible showing the value of each characteristic in regard to family development. And each chapter ends with a section asking pertinent questions about your own development in each of the steps and space to journal your answers.This would be a great study for small groups comprised of young mothers who seek to lead their family in a positive and biblical way!"

1,What a joke,"I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.WRONG! IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin. My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product. I even tried the ""gel"" version, thinking maybe the cream was a bit too heavy for my skin.But no - save your hard earned cash - the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice."
2,ALL HYPE!,"I was very skeptical about paying so much for a moisturizer but very desperate for a ""good miraculous"" moisturizer, so after reading all the reviews, i went ahead and payed the hefty $150. I am very disappointed to say that its very average, over-rated and very over-priced. Its so greasy, thick and sticky that i can only use it at night. I received a sample of the mositurizing lotion (same jar but reads ""moisturizing lotion"" instead of the cream) with my order and that one i do love because its very light and soft but its even pricier than the cream."
2,not what I had expected,"I found the cream ""heavy"" and wondered if I had the correct order as I had previously read good reviews on it."
3,Not especially impressed,"Although this product is supposed to be la creme de la creme, as far as moisturizers are concerned, I felt it was lacking. Too heavy, sticky, and my skin didn't really feel moisturized, just overwhelmed. I will continue to use the product, though, as I would like to observe it's effect on my skin over the next few weeks."
5,"The very best, most luxurious cream for your skin","I was among the unbelievers before I tried this -- now I am a true disciple. The creme is unlike most other moisturizers -- it is rich with nutrients that truly feed the skin. When I use La Creme, it makes me look and feel at last 10 years younger than I am. Yes, it is quite expensive; however, unlike most other creams, a little bit goes a long way. And the results are definitely worth it!"
1,FAKE!,Fake. Fake. Fake. This item is a fake. do not buy it and then complain about it because its a fake recreation. If you buy it and like it hell keep buying it but know its not the real cream.
3,Nothing new here,not very impressed....very bad qaulity sound....the bosstones sound much better live
1,For loyal Bosstones fans only,"I can't believe that everyone is giving this 5 stars! This is the first Bosstones album I ever bought because it has all the songs of theirs I've ever heard of on it, but I thought it was terrible! The guy singing sounds like a drunk frat boy doing karaoke. I regret buying this and can not recommend it unless you are just a completely loyal fanatic of this band. I guess I should have waited for a ""greates hits"" from these guys with the studio versions because the live versions stink. Well, I'm off to a local cd store that takes used cds to trade this one in!"
5,Great. Just great,"when i bought this album, the only Bosstones CD i had was ""Let's Face It,"" and i got ""Live from the Middle East"" because it looked sort of cool, and i had a couple of bucks to blow. Well, i'm glad i did, cuz i've listened to it nonstop since i got it."
5,Boston Boys Do It Better In Plaid!,"I've seen MMB in The Middle East several times and I've also seen them at Lollapalooza, these boys are definitely one of the best small venue shows around. This CD epitomizes what you experience at The Middle East. The guy from Spin needs to go to the Hometown Throwdown and see for himself what a great time it is. Dicky Barrett's razor-blade voice cuts right through you and makes the Bosstones what they are. Put on your plaid and get to Boston!!"
5,Great Book!,"This book is great and gives a Christian guide to raising kids that is practical!Thanks Ed Young, you did it again!"
5,Buy this book!,"I bought this book for my seven year old daughter. It is such a wonderful little book for her to work on. She loves her baby brother and has had a ball working on this kid-friendly book. I also liked how it has sections that she fills out about herself, so she feels special too. This book would also work for a younger child with an adult helping them. If you have an older child and a new baby I highly recommend buying this book for your older child. It will be a wonderful family keepsake for both older child and baby!!!!!"
5,Great gift for any sibling,I bought this book for my daughter before our son was born. It was a great way to get her involved and excited about the arrival of her new brother. It also gave me and my daughter an opportunity to do something together as some of the activities necessitate parental supervision. I'd recommend it to anyone expecting a new addition to the family. -Norma Rems
3,For Older Kids,"I got this for my son as a present. He is five, and his sister is 2. Well, this book is meant for older brothers (like 3rd grade and up or something), because my son still gets read to and the only thing he knows how to write is his ABC's, 123, and his name. I ended up filling in everything and giving it to him as a present, which is still nice as a keepsake, but if you're intending for a personal interaction for a big brother to do for a little sister, this is not it. It arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping, and I think the book was a bit overpriced for something like this, it wasn't even that decorative or anything - I've seen Mommy journals and Baby journals that were a lot fancier for less money, but quality too. I see the price has dropped since I bought it, probably because of my crappy review, haha."
5,"A perfect book for the younger, new big brother/sister","I bought this book for my 3 year old and it is perfect for her age level. With its large text, humorous check lists, and simple art and observational activities, it is perfect for the younger, new big brother or sister (3-6 yrs). This book allows the child to compare themselves to the baby which shows them how special they are, and how much care the baby needs."
4,Unsolved Mysteries of UFO's,This contains a good assortment of the interesting UFO episodes. A couple of the episodes are also repeated on the Best Of Unsolved Mysteries set.
5,Creepy,These supposed TRUE strories are facinating and creepy! Some of the stories are downright TERRIFYING so be prepaired and don't watch alone! LOL. Here is the complete segment listings for each disc:Disc 1:Bentwaters UFOAllagash AbductionsCrop CirclesPhoenix UFONazca LinesMexico UFOVancouver LightsDisc 2:RoswellRoswell/Area 51 ConnectionHudson Valley UFOBelgian UFOFalcon Lake UFOUFO HealingDisc 3:Austrailian UFOMissing TimeSocorro Close EncounterKecksburg UFOTexas UFOFace On MarsDisc 4:Men In BlackCanadian UFOWheatfields VisitationsLife On MarsInterceptorsThe BlobUFO Odyssey
5,"I Like Their UFO Stories and The Ghost Stories, Etc!","Unsolved Mysteries is a good show and while most of their stories were about real life unsolve murders I especially like it when they had stories about UFO's and other unexplained mysteries so I think a tape like this is good. I also like it when they have stories about ghosts and haunted houses, etc!"
2,like expensive cat food,"These K&N; filters are like buying a gormet treat for your cat- it's no better for the cat, but it makes you feel good. CR did an extensive test on oil filters a few years ago, using many brands including OEM, on many vehicles. In almost every test, the Fram filter was tops. So you're paying over twice the price for a gormet filter that works no better, but it won't break the bank and makes you feel like you're 'treating' your car.BTW, if you need a special nut to wrench the filter off, you're tightening it too darn much!"
5,Great Oil Filter,"I have used the K&N; HP-3001 for the last three oil changes on my 2003 Land Rover Discovery 2 and I am very pleased with the performance of the filter. I learned from a Land Rover forum that this filter was an excellent replacement for the stock filter on my truck as it has outstanding flow and filtering capabilities and also allows for higher oil capacity overall. It is quite a bit longer than the stock/OEM filter but there is ample room for the filter in the engine compartment of a D2. Like others, I also appreciate the nut welded on the bottom of the filter as it makes oil changes a snap. I love not having to break out my strap wrench when doing an oil change. I would recommend this filter to anyone looking to replace their stock oil filter with a higher performance model.Here's the website link if you'd like to take a look:[...]"
4,Dead Birds Singing-Beautifully Now,"I just read this book for a book report on Teen Realilistic fiction. I'm only in 6th grade and you may think I'm too young to know a good book, but It's all about a boy who has to cope with living with his friend when his mother and sister is hurt in a car crash. It will never leave my mind."
5,A good short overview of the Reformed tradition,"Steve Smallman packs a surprisingly large amount of content into this little booklet. He gives a very short history of the Reformed tradition, then moves on to state some of the key Reformed doctrinal positions. A book of this size is not designed to prove these doctrinal positions, merely to state them and he does a good job.Smallman discusses the Reformed views of Scripture, God's Sovereignty, the church, the covenants, the law of God, and the sacraments. I was impressed that he even gave a quick and dirty explanation of the three uses of the law.This is a good booklet to give to new members in a Reformed church. This will let them know what the church believes. Of course, they will need to go to other books to find the proof of these points (may I suggest Michael Scott Horton's ""Putting Amazing Back Into Grace""), but this booklet does a great job of stating the Reformed views in a quick format."
3,Box is OK: the ad is misleading,"I needed a new weatherized box for the side of my house. The item description on Amazon leaves a lot to be desired - the photos accompanying the ad are misleading. I wasn't sure if the box itself was white or just the receptacle included with it. Luckily the box was white - what I wanted. However, the cover was worthless - I threw it away. Fortunately I had an older one I could paint white to match the box. The lids over the outlets on the new one don't stay open and it is virtually impossible to plug anything in with a spring loaded lid that won't stay open. It is probably a nanny-state requirement for morons these days; worthless. Again, the ad photo is misleading because it shows the lid open all by itself - not so on the one I received."
3,Who Is this????,"If I was not looking at the screen I would think listening to a Teenage Fanclub recording. But that is not a bad thing anyway. Still, very pleseant, I would add a 1/2 star if I could but in this case I have to round the score down a notch."
4,Music Moves My Soul,"I have never seen this band live, but I know that they would sound fantastic! I enjoyed ""Magnolia"" and likewise ""Big Wheel"" has not disappointed me....I just need to get their first album so I can be up to speed. THANKS for the music guys and also for the uplifting message that (always) comes through in the words."
5,The Wheelies Do It Again (was there any doubt?),"People in Canada have heard of SCW and after one listen, I have no trouble comparing ""Big Wheel"" to the first two albums. Intricate dual guitar leads, hard-rocking boogie beats, awesome vocals; the Wheelies match and may even surpass previous efforts. Check out the wah-wah solo and congas in their cover of Dr. John's ""Right Place, Wrong Time."" Every track has something amazing to offer listeners both old and new. Buy two copies because you'll want to share this one with a friend."
2,"Not a ""family"" Bible","While this Bible story book retells many common and uncommon Bible storeis, there are three major drawbacks. First, the author takes liberty to add to and enhance many of the stories (while he admits to this on the appropriate pages, it is hard for children to understand the difference of story and truth). Additionally, the author mentions the word ""sex"" twice - once in the story of Hagar and once in the story of David & Bathsheba. Further, the author summarizes the book of Song of Songs, which while it is biblical, is not appropriate for children. These factors make this NOT a ""family"" story Bible. We do not recommend this story Bible for your family."
4,Some good early work by Lou Ann and Stevie,"When I got this for a birthday gift and saw Stevie Ray Vaughan mentioned on the cover and extensively in the brief liner notes I figured it was mainly to help with sales and that there would be some rough, early work from Stevie Ray. Well, Stevie does a fine job and is already in quite distinctive form, thought it would improve as his career blossomed. Lou Ann does a fine job, as well, and these two made some great tracks together here.The early tracks on this CD sound like they were recorded months or years earlier and yes, it is not a great recording but it is still good material. The tracks with Stevie are tighter and better recorded. A good deal for Stevie or Lou Ann fans (whatever happened to her?) but be warned the CD does not even list the authors of the songs or the other members of the band."
4,Sugar coated love,"I had heard of this album while surfing a blues music page and bought it primarily because of SRV-in case you don't know- a young SRV plays on the last 8 or so tracks-just this alone is worth its weight in gold to any hardcore SRV fan,however i was pleasently surprised with miss Lou Ann ,yes it is a bit rough to those used to digital cd music but it has soul--you can envision the things to come from both of these artists ---it is not for those looking for a polished work,however it is a very good album in its own right and if you are a big SRV fan or like female blues singers or both,it is worth a listen"
4,Another collection of speed anthems for Metropolis Records,"No, ""Angels Only"" doesn't let you down. It speeds you up. This is what most of us want from our EBM.I agree with most of the reviewers that this album is simplistic and we can argue for days about whether a band should evolve or stick with their creative roots, but the fact is that they deliver some fresh body-twitching electro.I don't look to EBM for artistic revelation and I certainly don't look to European bands for profound lyrics in English. EBM is primarily about a body high and this album gives you that.You can stubbornly listen to Apop's ""The Apocalyptic Manifesto"" for the 6000th time or you can buy something new. If you decide on ""something new"" consider ""Angels Only""."
4,Digitrax book,"This is a reprint of a book published in 1999. At that time it would have been a real asset. Much of the information still applies and it is well worth it for that reason. However, Many of the Digitrax devices discussed have been upgraded or replaced. With the good information it contains it would be great if it was brought up to date."
4,DCC,Helping me understand how to use the DCC system so I can run my N Scale trains and enjoy my sets
3,Jump,"Not as good as I expected, considering how much I like Eddie Miller and George Van Eps on other records."
5,Abso-freaking-lutely amazing...,"Mere words cannot describe the mastery in which Tom Jenkinson makes music. It is impossible. He plays the bass, keyboards, and spins(not at the same time, mind you).The Gods of techno need to bow down to the man known as Squarepusher. He deserves every moment of it."
3,It has its moments...,"This disc does have some interesting tracks (the first three are brilliant) yet there are some definate throw aways, such as tracks 4 and 7... Not worth the expensive import price. ""Hard Normal Daddy"", Squarepusher's 2nd album, is a much more solid release."
2,Oops ~,"I've heard some good Squarepusher but this certainly was not it. Not recommended. I much prefer intense, articulate composition to jazzy inner-city sewer soundtracks."
5,The BEST DVD for Beginers,"Out of all the other that i have this is the BEST one. They break it down step by step... even I can learn it if you make it this easy. The best way to learn and polish up your techniques. Not only does this DVD teach the basic steps but gets you ready for the clubs, watch and learn and practice, practice, practice.Tenia is a babe !!"
4,A good call,This brings the quail running your way. I like it because you can just put it between your lips and keep your hands free while calling.
5,Ancient Eurocentric History,"This book is a treasure chest of ancient facts.Hyma suffers the delusions of his generation, like Wells, Robinson, and Toynbee, in believing that Egyptians were sun tanned Caucasians. After that, he glibly thanks them for civilization.Genetics has debunked these myths although they persist up to 1996 in Lefkowitz's NOT Out of Africa.In the end, this and the other works of this generation, thinking they were Eurocentric, were actually the most Afrocentric material written.This little book's importance is that it has been on college bookshelves since 1940 and reprinted many times.It is a keeper."
5,I love this movie!,"Never saw this one before. The tape was in good watchable condition and fast shipping. Very romantic duet of ""Wanting You"" is in itself worth watching! Wow, what chemistry these two had! I could listen to them sing all day! In fact, sometimes I do. :) The story is kind of a retelling of Naughty Marietta, isn't it? Except he's the royal masquerading as a servant. I love the ending on the island (man, this story is all over the place isn't it?) where she marries him so he'll protect her from the other men's advances...and yet, she falls for him. Very sweet. I wish our movies were more romantic like these old ones!"
3,Comic classic,"Disapointed really, full of slapstick humour which I like very much but somehow it left me cold it was too full on and the characters and the story line did not really develope. I admit here I loved it years ago when I saw it at the movies but I don't love it now, I prefer a book like Hotel Le Big Knob that is very funny but the characters progress to a new, how shall I put it, a new understanding of themselves. However if you love slapstick this is the play for you."
4,Beautiful music for our wedding!,I used this cd at my wedding and it was beautiful! Its a wonderful cd!
5,what a beautiful album!,"This is a refreashing way to put Metal music to classical arrangements. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin have been doing it for a while now but this is one of the best! Plus they have their own music too! Their performance of One, and Nothing else matters, make this a must have for any one that enjoys powerful music of any type. They can pull you in with thier intelligence then punch you in the face with thier Metal edge. What an amazing talent this group has! Loved thier first album too!"
4,quite a great job,"how amazing to hear the Apocalyptica new stuff ! I like the way they play Metallica. it's an incredible way to make people understand how musically strong the guys are ! Apocalyptica also shows that they can make music, which is far from noise, so as Metallica does. Good, good, good, except maybe for some of the other songs, which don't make a great deal with the violon stuff !"
4,An exciting mix of metal and classical; a whole new sound.,"This is really amazing. Four electronically amplified cellos that excite the ear. It is a replay of old Metallica and Pantera with a classical twist. A really enjoyable, original album."
2,The New Classical Music? Oh Puleeease...,"I enjoy this album because of its uniqueness within the narrow realm of metal music to which I listen to seldomly. One does not have to go far into this work to find real potential of these players. They are competent and inovative with their instruments.I admire the enthusiasm of the all the cult followers of Apocalyptica who grace this customer review secion. However, the various assertions that this is the classic music of the future and all that is founded only in their visceral confusion about what makes good music.No way does the talent of the Apocalyptica boys match that of Rastipovitch or Yo-Yo Ma. Check out the masters' Bach variations and you will hear traditional classical that remains current, metal, enticing, suicidal... much more than you can get with Apocalyptica with actual melody, insight, timeliness and all with a single cello!"
3,Amazing and very unique,"I just heard or am right now hearing ""Fade to Black"", its beautiful...Metallica Symphony, I am only giving the CD a 3 though cause I havent heard much but I can tell that it will be good later on. I never knew a band would ever do covers of a metal band and make them to Symphony and it would be so beautiful...When I hear more I just may have to make it more stars."
4,a little different,"I only knocked this down to four stars because on this album the gentlemen were not quite so religious in their interpretation of the Metallica tunes. On the first album, it was a note-for-note expression of the Metallica songs, but on this album, they changed some of the song structure. I was disappointed by the 4 minute version of ""One."" However, it is still an awesome album; a must-buy for any speedmetal fan who also has a closet collection of baroque."
4,Really good music in its own right,"I first heard this music on Launch, and bought the album. I'm delighted with it, as the four cello re-take on Metallica is very pleasant on the ears. I enjoy listening to it very much.Only thing that slows it down, is when they try to replicate the super-fast guitar riffs on the cello, and slow it down a bit awkwardly. Other than that, fantastic."
4,My daughter loves this book!,My two year old loves this sticker book. In fact I have already bought a couple for her. She has now figured out how to take a sticker and find a page with the matching outline on it. She loves Dora and this book as well. I think it's a fun treat for any little one who likes Dora.
3,I wish it was more scenic and colorful,"My son loves to put stickers on and take them off again so the fact that these are reuseable is great and there are a lot of stickers. However, I thought that there would be more pages of just scenes that he could put the stickers on where he wanted to. There is one page that is really colorful like that and the bottom third of a couple but the rest of the pages to put the stickers on are just white with the outlines of some of the character stickers where you are supposed to match them up. That is a little diffucult/boring for a 3 year old. Also the 16 pages includes 4 pages of stickers and the blank backside of those 4 pages and the introduction page so there is only 7 pages to put the stickers on. Overall I wish I had not purchased this item."
4,Fun Dora Book,"If your child loves Dora and stickers, its a great book. Its not a coloring book with a few stickers like some, its full of stickers that they can use to match up against a silhouette image with a description. Good test of their ability to recognize shapes. Or just go crazy and use the stickers anywhere they want. Our child loves stickers (age 3) and loved the book."
2,Don't Bother,"I bought this for my 5-year-old niece and was very disappointed. I bought the Spanish-English version because I thought it would be educational and most of what DK makes is excellent. There are a lot of stickers, but the book focuses on placing them in the ""right"" place which seems pointless. I thought they would have more scenes to allow children to use their imaginations but there is only 1. On top of that, the stickers are supposed to be reusable but they really aren't."
1,not happy,I ordered this book for my grandaughters birthday on aug 24 hopping id get it in time for her b day . im still waiting on the book. its Sep 10th now and still have not recived this book . woundering if ill ever get it.
4,A lion's tale,This is a beautifully written and illustrated book written from a lion's perspective. A superb story based on excellent natural history. A wonderful read!
5,Excelent book,"Very clear written and useful for planning circumnavigation, including all necessary information that will be needed for planing a voyage in any of world's ocean with weather and nautical informations."
4,The title says it all,"Unless you're a professional sailor, then this book probably tells you everything you need to know to get you started on planning your cruising routes just about anywhere around the world. Lots of insights and tips to the respective routes. Quite factual and dry, focused on timings, currents, distances and other technical details necessary for route planning. For me it would be great to have someone like Jimmy produce several books, each specific to a region, however, providing at least an overview on the attractions on route. This would have added much value to my ability to actually plan an entire journey, rather than knowing how to get from A to B. Does anyone know of such material for the Meditteranean and the Atlantic crossing from Gibraltar to the Caribbean?"
2,A laborious book of recipes. Disappointing!,"In the circumnavigators world,everybody talks about this book. You find it on many yachts... A must?My disappointment comes to some extent of a high expectation.I found it terribly repetitive, describing each of many ways of crossing an ocean, with the same information repeated again and again, as if talking to a small child, without giving the ""big picture"" of this ocean.Ocean Passages and Landfalls by Rod Heikell is a lighter, much more enjoyable tool allowing the reader to ""understand the gastronomy"" instead of ""following the recipe""."
4,Sail Voyage Planing,It's a book that is a must have for any voyage. I wish the author would have included more maps but still a have to have book.
5,Must have,"While no one book alone can aid you in trip planning, this book can be a great start. If you plan on cruising, this book is a must have for the boats library."
5,Why didn't this make it before? This is amazing!,"This has to be one of the most original albums I've ever listened to. It has it all: smooth, jazzy ballads; experimental pop sounds; acoustic. Most of her fans are used to her using an mellow-sounding Broadway voice, which I love; but this album really shows the versatility of her vocal styles. She doesn't hold back; she is completely honest in each song and tells us how she really feels. The lyrics really make you think about what she's saying. If you're a true-blue Idina fan like me, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Idina Menzel Still I Can't Be Still,I did a search for Idina because I heard her amazing performance on the RENT original Broadway cast recording. I knew I wanted to hear more!This CD is so wonderful it deserve airplay!...Idina's voice will just knock you socks off.This is NOT another Broadway diva rehashing Broadway standards.Every track is fresh and unique because she wrote all the songs herself.I Love This CD!...
5,Still I Can't Be Still,Excellent CD! Has the perfect mix of upbeat and relaxing songs. Idina needs to put some more records out there!
2,What am I missing?,"I love Idina Menzel's voice. That being said, a couple of songs were okay but most of this was just not that good."
5,Still my stereo can't be still,I have listened to this album so many times I had to buy another one! My first copy is completely worn out. I guarantee you will love this album if you enjoy a mix of many different song styles. She is an amazing performer!
2,Disappointing,"When I ordered this, I guess I expected the content to be more like the performances she gave in ""Rent"" and ""Wicked"", that is to say, adult fare. I did not expect stuff akin to hip-hop or teeny bopper music. She is MUCH more talented that this dismal CD affords. I will order another- hopefully that better showcases her abilities. Sorry."
3,No zombies - just druggies,"I was really hoping there were zombies in this book, going by the cover and the title. Sadly, no undead were present. There are plenty of people addicted to a parasite attached to their leg, but that was it.The story is a little slow going. It involves a psionic character trying to find out why someone was killed. I think it's 'typical' Science Fiction. Not something I am interested in. Maybe you will be."
4,From the back cover,"Slow SuicideWhat is behind the rumor of drug-running in the Castor/Pollux sector? Once, that region of space was noted for its thinkers and dreamers, its innovators and builders. Now it is fading from human commerce, and no one knows why.The danger -- whatever it is -- is spreading. More planets struggle in the grip of ennui and despair. The call goes out to the Guild of Thieves: unorthodox warriors who fight with psi powers and samurai tactics. But they face a threat for which they are not prepared..."
1,"Poorly written, poorly edited","This book is chalk-full of errors. And this is the second edition. Apparently little effort was made in improving the first edition. One must wonder if it was written in twenty-four hours.A book on a programming language needs credibility. Learning a foreign syntax is difficult enough as it is without behing hampered by one's learning material. By the time I got to chapter 4, all hope of credibility was lost, and this book is now going back to the bookstore."
2,not very good (2nd Edition),"I have to believe that anyone who read this book and claimed that it was free of typos either doesn't know how to read or didn't learn a thing. This book is so filled with typos that I wouldn't have learned a thing if this weren't the second book that I have read on SQL and help from a friend of mine. The typos were not of the missing comma sort, they were entirely missing joins in statements that wouldn't work without them, wrong answers in the answer key, answers to questions that weren't even asked and a bucket full of missing semi-colons.This book is clearly a very beginner book it basically touches (and when I mean touches, I mean it lightly caresses) just about everything. Another thing that I couldn't understand is the way the author wouldn't tie the examples together. In one statment you create a new temp table in the next statment you are deleting a temp table but it has a different name and you never created that table to begin with."
1,ERRORS and BAD Examples,"I knew some SQL and chose this book to drill it in since I hadn't used it in a while.This book is pretty basic, but that was expected.Whenever I read a review that mentioned errors in a book I didn't really see the big deal or imagine how bad it could be, but it is a big deal and it's a royal pain in the you know. In this book there are errors in examples, in quizes, in syntax, you name it. And this is the 2nd edition too.Even more important, the examples are not good at all. I know what they are trying to say because I know some SQL but I feel bad for the beginner. The examples are not relevant to the particular components they are trying to teach half the time.I will never get one of these books again, the lack of care put into the editing alone says something about Sams."
3,2 or 3 worthwhile chapters,"This would be a better library book to flip through. The book *tries* to teach you how to be a sql query writer; a sql administrator; a programmer with interfaces in sql. As one might expect, this is too broad a scope for any book, much less for one that is supposed to teach you everything in 24 hours! The book does a good job of walking you step by step through the lessons, and each is very easy to understand. After you've got the basics of query structure and language though, there is not enough reference material to help you get to intermediate queries. I'd keep looking or spend an hour with it in the library."
1,Yuck! Terrible.,"Really not what I was expecting - sorry. I know many liked it, I just didn't - one man's opinion."
1,Tastes terrible,"I was actually looking for Kraft easy-mac style cheese sauce powder when I bought this, so you know my standards aren't high. This sauce lacks flavor, is startlingly high in calories, has an odd texture on the tongue, and tastes neither like real cheese or tasty fake cheese. I donated the remaining packets to a food bank."
1,not like Kraft Cheese,I had bought the white powdered cheese (3 bags Land O'Lakes) before and the orange cheese from Barry Farm.My Kids loved both.This was cheaper and I am so used to free shipping from Amazon I went with this for a cheaper per ounce total cost.We used one packet and the kids refuse to eat any more.Buy the white or the orange.
2,i really wanted to like this movie,"Steve Gordon wrote and directed one of my favorite films of all time in ""Arthur"" (1981). As his only other writing credit, I was hoping this was a hidden gem, and eagerly purchased it. Not only was Gordon behind it, but it stars Henry Winkler and was directed by Carl Reiner- and the plot would at least sound compelling! I wanted so badly to fall in love with it, but I couldn't. The protagonist will frustrate you, the humor will fall flat, and if you've seen Arthur, you'll wonder how the same mind could have dreamt this one up.That being said, go watch Arthur (the original, with Dudley Moore- not the Russell Brand remake). I've never met someone who didn't enjoy it."
1,"Not As Advertised as ""Family Friendly""","This movie should not have been rated PG and if you are planning to watch this movie with teenagers, or if you are a Christian, or just have normal (old fashioned) standards about decency, I strongly suggest you do not purchase this movie. We watched with our teenage daughters and we turned it off half way through. Bad movie and misleading rating. Download quality was poor. Strike 3. Out."
4,"Great , filled me in on spots left blank in the episodes.","This was a great movie, possibly the best Gundam Wing series movies. The fighting was fantastic, but what I liked the most was how the movie filled in blank spots from the television series. It mad have a better understanding for Gundam Wing. Anyone who is confused at all with the T.V. series plot should by this video, or possibly DVD. Any Gundam fan must have this video. The only bad part was that all the Gundam T.V. episodes major fight scenes are excactly the same as this. I think this is a good 'historical' video for Gundam, shall I say. I watch this video over and over again, and I love it more every time."
4,4 and a half REALLY!,"Numb is one of the better so called ""industrial"" bands to come out in the 1990's. This band has always challenged themselves with atypical melodies and chord progressions. This CD only had two cuts that are not unique in that they do fall prey to that Trance beat in a way, but even those songs show uniqueness and depth. The rest of the CD starts to show a lean towards the sound they present on Blood Meridian. The band's use of synthetics is full, fresh and mature. I am thinking the band is not around any more, which is an industrial listener's loss. Fantastic spin!"
5,Compelling Reading,"An overview of the SAS fight against the IRA, it appears that a shoot to kill policy may have been in place as the SAS killed many IRA terrorists during their covert operations.Great insight into the skill and sophistication of the IRA and the SAS."
3,SAS vs. IRA,"SAS vs. IRAMark Urban's book ""Big Boys' Rules: The Secret Struggle Against the IRA"" provides an in-depth account of the counter-insurgent activities of the elite British 22 Special Air Service (SAS) and other security forces in the Northern Ireland conflict beginning in the 1970s and ending with the 1987 Loughgall incident. Urban draws on extensive interviews with those involved in intelligence and special operations in Northern Ireland during this time. He details how the security force apparatus was structured, effectively deployed, and how the British executed tasks in the field."
3,Big Boys' Rules: The SAS and the Secret Struggle Against the IRA,"The title of this book is misleading. This book spends a minimal amount of time discussing the SAS's operations and a great deal of time discussing the relationship between the RUC and the military. If you are interested in the strategic significance of the actions taken in Northern Ireland this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book similar to Urban's most recent book, ""Task Force Black"" this is not it. Despite that I did enjoy the book and would still recommend it to those interested in Northern Ireland."
1,Average,Urban's book is written is a newspaper style reporting facts without military or political content. The two reasons it is one of his early books and the current war on terrorists hadn't started. He could easily update book increase it value by going back adding comparison to current conflicts.
1,This band should break up,"This band should break up they are so bad. The songs are weak, the guitar playing is horrendous, and the lyrics are lame. If there was a lower score than 1 star say -12 stars I would give it to them. Also, even the pictures inside are bad. Is it Sergeant Pepper meets corporeal loser and private piece of ____!"
5,Great Album,I love this album...every song...andLIFE GOES ON is one of te best songs I've ever heard!
5,The best CD I've bought all year!,This band is gonna be huge--the music is great--the guitar especially rocks & Paul Kenney write's the best lyrics!
4,fun for the family,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and he loves it. It's not quite age appropriate for him (says age 4 & up). We all have fun with it! My 2 year old likes to push the button and hear the D-E-E-R-E song. It is very cute!
1,very disappointed with this item,I bought this for my 4 yr old nephew and it doesn't work. he tried to reel in the line and it doesn't reel in. the magnetic parts are not at all magnetic. this is very small. i am not happy with this item. i would like to return it for him.
4,Great Toy!,"I ordered this fishing pole for my son's 4th birthday because he is obsessed with fishing. It is the perfect size for him, and it makes noises as if he is really fishing. The line reels in and out just by turning the handle, and the fish and hook are magnetic. My son loves this fishing pole!"
3,Cute toy but not 100% satisfied.,"The toy is really cute and love that it makes sounds but the magnets are not strong enough for the fish. The fish have trouble getting on the hook and then don't stay on while it is beening reeled up, my son wasn't too happy about that. The line isn't that long, I guess that is a safety precaution, when you reel it up it goes so far up and then back down. I don't think it's going to last very long. Hope this helps,not trying to be negative, just honest."
2,Broke too fast!,"My son absolutely loved this toy until he was ""fishing"" and the top part broke off when he pulled the string out. While it lasted it was great, but for the money I would not recommend it to buy!"
3,bought this for my 4 year old,"I got this for my 4 year old thinking he would have fun. The pole is okay, and the reel isn't a true reel and takes a long time to reel in. He still had fun with it for about a day and now it's sitting at the bottom of a toy box I think."
3,Okay toy,"I wasn't at all impressed by this toy fishing set. The magnetic fish sink, so it wasn't feasible to use in a swimming pool. The pole doesn't extend and reel well and kept getting stuck. The line isn't very long.Overall, just not that great."
4,fun,Item as expected. Would not recomend for very young kids as the pole extends out and can be dangerus if not properly handled. Overall a good product. Shipped on time.
1,Don't waste your $,"Doesn't work at all. We had already thrown the box away before trying it or it would be going back. Piece of junk, doesn't reel more than a 1/4 of the way up."
2,Disappointed,"was disappointed with the reel, it does not pull up all the way. It broke within the first few days."
1,DEFECTIVE TOY. AVOID.,"I can't explain how some parents love this toy. Perhaps they did not receive a defective one. The fishing reel won't reel in or out. The fish sink. The end magnet is too weak to actually snare one of the fish, and even an adult can't work with it, so how can a child? The toy doesn't function, but it is bright colored and sturdy and looks handsome in the box. Perhaps there is or was a manufacturing problem, and the defective models are being sold off. I recommend to avoid this toy. The only playing our 3-year old could figure out was to pretend the fishing reel is a guitar, so I'm returning the reel."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This toy is JUNK. It broke the first time it was used, much like the John Deere lawn mower we owned! They didn't stand behind that, so I'm not even trying with the toy. I've learned my lesson. I will not spend another dime on this brand."
2,didn't like it,"I gave this fishing pole to my 3 year old of Christmas and was very disappointed. The hook of the fishing pole easily broke within 1 week. The biggest problem was the reeling feature. It simply couldn't pull up one of the fish. And, the fish's magnetic portion of their mouths didn't click well with the magnetic hook. Huge disappointment."
2,Didn't suit our needs,"Was looking for a durable fishing pole to use for an educational ""action station"" at our nature center. Purchased this due to the very positive reviews and the magnetic set-up of the lure. Figured it would be perfect to use in a small space to catch fish print-outs that had paper clips attached to their mouths. We didn't want to use a real fishing pole due to their size and the potential for the fishing line to break or get tangeled.The magnet was too weak to pick up the paperclip fish even though they were VERY light weight. Also the line barely came out. We didn't want something with a lot of line but more than 6-8 inches would have been nice.It's a cute toy and seemed durable enough but we sent it back because it wasn't going to serve our purposes."
4,John Deere,Gave as a gift good toy. The only complaint is the magnet is not strong enough to hold the fish very well.
1,Not so good,I sent back this toy. The fish don't float and the magnetic part is on the tip of the fish which makes it difficult to catch them with the pole.
2,Silly waste of time,I got this silly thing for my 4 year old grandaughter...What a waste..It certainly is not educational..I really do not know what to say...
2,John Deere fishing pole,I was so excited to give this to my son for Christmas. He is 3.5 yrs old. I thought there was something wrong as the line would only go down about 2 feet max. It didn't wind back up either very well. I took it apart to examine and realized that's as good as it gets. Too bad. It was difficult to play with him and pretend we were fishing.
3,Product is as advertised.,"Fun, but my four year old son does not play with it as frequently as I had expected. Toy was not a disappointment as it does all the things it says it should. Just doesn't seem to entertain my son for a very long time."
2,"A month has gone by,",it's 30 days today and I haven't gotten my book! I've never had a problem before. I contacted the company and they said it can take this long...
2,Done too many times before,I loved Debra Mullins Once a Mistress but was dissapointed in this book. While the characters were quite likeable to be honest I couldn't get past the plot as it all seems to have been done before. Heroine has scandal in her past and has fought to be respectable ditto hero and both fight off their attraction to one another. Debra does have a great writing style and to be fair to her I could only read half of the book before I lost interest so perhaps the story did pick up.
5,Amazing poet,Had the privilege of meeting David and going to his poetry reading. His poetry is advanced and beautiful with music and life! He finds all those small holes in the universe and gives them life. A pure joy and increadible talent.
4,Great personality but not that attractive...,"I'll be honest with you; Tango N Vectif is HARSH like a bad lover. And it doesn't get much softer with repeated listenings. Although this music might lack surface beauty, it has great personality. If you've heard U-Ziq's more accessible Bluff Limbo then you know what to expect. But be warned! If your looking for some easy listening music you're in for a rude awakening! This stuff ain't for everybody."
2,IMAGINE IF YOU WILL...,"IMAGINE IF YOU WILL a movie where Ice-T is NOT the worst actor. Scary huh. They attempted to combine an action and science fiction movie and did it rather poorly. There just wasn't enough suspense, terror, or conflict in a damaged space lab to carry the movie. And another thing, there is no noise in outer space. Sound requires air to make sound waves. The doors on the space station looked like they came from Star Trek. HEY! We still use old fashion metal hatches that can make a real seal."
1,"Makes ""Queen of Outer Space"" look high-budget!","Horrible movie. Begins with a drug bust then suddenly, those characters disappear and you're on a space station. Totally unrealistic. The ""space station"" has passageways like a Vegas casino. In one scene, a hero takes off in an F-16 and suddenly, they're flying in an F-15. It's as though no one really cared about these blunders. Asteroid impacts seem depicted by the sparks of a grinder on metal. While I couldn't watch the entire movie, I'll bet it ended in a submarine. I think I'll go watch Plan 9 from Outer Space. At least it's funny."
5,Perfect!,I bought this to make magnets out of getglue stickers. The paper punch cuts perfectly clean even with the thick magnetic sheets.
4,amazon is awesome!,"The punch seems good...smooth circle, smooth edge. The product title does not say circle or scallop and under the color description it states ""1.25"" Scallop Circle"". This is not correct. The punch is 1.5 circle as shown in the picture. I should have looked a little closer because I wanted a scalloped circle so planned to return the item. Amazon processed my return and did not require me to return the item. How awesome is that...granted I purchase frequently...but that is great customer service! Saved me the trip to UPS or USPS. Thanks!!!! Not sure what I'll use the 1.5 circle punch for but maybe my kids can find a use ;)"
5,All Moms Should Read This,"The main character, Colorado resident Becca Joy, is pregnant with her fifth - count 'em - fifth child. She doesn't know if she can handle it. With her oldest son wanting to attend college in far away Hawaii, Becca is simultaneously having empty nest syndrome and pregnancy cravings. There to help her is her lifelong best friend, Allie. Allie surprises her friend with a spa trip. But in the meantime, there is the perfect, Martha Stewart neighbor next door, an eccentric and irritating mother-in-law, and an even more irritating sister to deal with.Author Debbie DiGiovanni is Christian, and her book has a few Scriptural and spiritual references. Not at all heavy handed, the religious overtones are as light as sunshine. Christians will appreciate the book more, but anyone can enjoy the book."
3,"Not Quite, but Acceptable","Well, clearly the container is original but I'm not sure about the lotion inside. It certainly is a good imitation and I would keep it."
4,Tekken Tag Tournament,I really enjoyed play Tekken Tag. I really liked the fact that the characters' head follows the other character around.
2,a little disappointed,"I love the TEKKEN series, having worn out TEKKEN 2 and TEKKEN 3...but I'm a bit disappointed by TEKKEN TAG. It looks great...there's no denying that, but the moves are basically the same as the earlier versions. I went through all of Julie Chang's 10-combo moves like I was playing T2. And that's boring. I was also disappointed by it's lack of 3D movement (you still only move back and forth)...I'm spoiled by Namco's SOUL CALIBUR, which has significantly more 3D action. This game is a nice VISUAL overhaul, but control and action-wise, you're still limited to the same old moves with the same old controllers. Too bad."
3,Cool game but,"it does get old after a while. Dont get me wrong, I love this game but it would be better if they made more modes. And boling mode is fun."
3,"Good, but not as good as hoped...","I bought this game with my PS2 in June and I couldn't wait to get it in october. Well the day arrived...and came and went like minnesota weather. Basicly, this game is fun for previous players of Tekken, but offers no new variety of gameplay. My suggestion, get Tekken if you're new to the series, and if you are a hardcore Tekken player...otherwise, get another game to entertain yourself with."
5,"Tekken, king of fighting games.","Any serious gamer will agree that Tekken is one of the most advanced and fun fighting games around. It has survived through 4 versions and managed to not stagnate like many others have. Mortal Kombat for example. The game combines characters from all three tekkens and still retains playabilty. This is because all of the characters have been upgraded and they all have new moves.As for the graphics. We all know that the ps2 is a graphics machine. And TTT is no exception. As far as I'm concerned, TTT on the ps2 looks better than any game in the arcade, PC, or dreamcast to date.If you want a game that won't collect dust on your entertainment center after 10 hours of gameplay, then I highly recommend you look into this game. I've been playing it since it came out, and I will continue to play it until the next version of tekken is released."
2,"Just like all ps2 things, hyped up to be what it's not.","I am the owner of a ps and a dc. I have seen pictures of this gamein my official playstatoin magizine and pretty much every where else along with ps2. I also own soul calibur, a game for my dc and let me just say, soul calibur beats the pants off of this game. THis game is just about like tekken 1, 2 , and 3, only hyped up to be the savior of all fighting games. It is not. I would rate tekken 2 batter than this piece of junk. And soul calibur beats them all, so save your money, you could buy a much better game..or for that matter a better console."
1,What a dissapointment!!!,"The first thing that will pop into your mind when you first see the game is ""No way is this next generation, is it???""Take Tekken 3, give it slightly better graphics, add a lame tag mode, make it look jaggy as hell and you have TTT.Blech"
1,Not a good multi player game,I wasn't impressed with the games graphics. The opening introductions graphics were awsome but then after that it was all down hill. I suggest that if anyone wants a game that has awsome graphics and gameplay they should go out and buy WDL World Destruction Tanks. WDL you can play 4 players at once and the graphics are way better than Tekken. Don't buy this game if you have it on any other console because this game is the same. I also highly recommend Aqua Aqua if you are into a strategy game that is very challenging. Those are the only two games on the Sony 2 that display the awsome potential of the Sony 2. It seems like a lot of these game manufacturers are rushing these games out. Madden is not a bad game but it also displays similiar graphics to the Sony 1 version.
1,Can this get any worse?,"I don't know why I keep buying games in this series, I now own Tekken 1,2,3,T and let me just say this:If you're new to console gaming, if you liked games like ""Street Fighter I"" or ""Sango"", DO NOT buy this game. this series always lacked on playability and never got over the ""click as many buttons as possible"" rutine.It's about time gaming companies like Namco will understand, that it's not about how many 'special' moves you got, and it's not about how realistic you make the game, it sure as hell not about the graphics or sound, and its not actions and reactions that makes a fighting game deep."
3,"fun, but gets old fast","well, i really liked this game when i got it and still play it every now and then, but the initial thrill is mostly gone. There are numerous characters to earn and moves to learn plus an entertaining bowling mini game, but this all becomes old news after a month. Button mashing will get you through this one, same as with all the other tekken games, but i don't see that bug ever getting fixed, so i guess i'll have to come to grips with that. Don't pay too much for this."
2,Weak...,"TTT was supposed to be the best fighting game ever, well I'm here to tell you it isn't. The graphics are pretty good, but not much else. It's enivitibility that really kills TTT because inevitibly after a few weeks this game will get boring, and will end up collecting dust on your shelf. Ignore all the 5-star reviews at ..., trust me, TTT doesn't live up tothe hype."
3,tekken tag only attempted to match DOA2,"All that Tekken Tag is, is the same old version of tekken but with better graphics and a tag mode, other than that theres nothing else. I think the only reason they added a tag mode to it was so they could compete with Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore. I personally like DOA 2 better than Tekken Tag, but it is still a good game overall. If you are a die hard Tekken fan, get the game."
1,don't buy,"this is the worst game you can buy. it's a HHHHOOORRRIIBBBBBLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! game. it's a west of your time and i know it's cheap, but still not a good game"
3,I was unimpressed.,I was not happy. I was looking for an improvement on the Tekken series. The only improvement is graphics. The game play is the same as all of the previous versions.Were are the weapons? Were is the 3-D control? I can't strafe?
3,"Good game, but not that deep.","I'm not going to say the same things that the other people who gave the game three stars.First I'll start with the game's good points. Killer graphics that demonstrate the PS2's power even in this early stage. The roster of characters is very impressive. It also has the same old Tekken gameplay.That's where this game faults in my opinion. Fighting games such as this just don't cut it for me anymore. If I want killer graphics combined with excellent and unique gameplay, I'll turn to DOA2: Hardcore and Soul Calibur for the Dreamcast. If I want some great tag-team fighting action or a large roster of characters, I'll turn to Marvel V.S. Capcom 2.By main complaint, though, is the gameplay. It seems less deep than the fighting games mentioned above. If this is supposed to be a next-generation game, it needs to have more advanced gameplay."
4,losers have a chance now,"for all you people who lost in tekkens before, you have a chance. you can control two people. if your about to die you can switch to someone else. you can choose all the people from the games before. i like this game alot but i still lose."
4,Best PS2 Fighting Game Yet,"This is the best fighting game I have ever played.You will be amazed by this game's graphics.The game is overall amazing, it has great sound,graphics,controls plus it is fun.There is a lot of cool characters(my favorite is Tiger).It is very short and easy but you need to beat it many times to unlock everything.Despite it's flaws it is great."
3,Great Game,"This was one of the first games that my wife and I brought for our Playstation 2 and I think it is one of the best. I had a hard time with it at first, but as I began to play more often I loved it. The ""Survior"" mode caught me. I am very competitive and wanted to be the number one survivor. When you get to additional fighters like ""TrueOgre"" and ""Devil"" you may not be able to put it down. I would not recomend this game for young children as the ""teen"" rating on this game is very appropriate. Buy it, you'll love it!"
5,Best fighting game I've ever played...,"This is the most fun fighting game I've ever played. As a 2nd Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, I love to play as Baek & Hworang in TKD Uniforms, as they are supposedly TKD stylists. I am trying to train myself to do some of thier combinations in real life for my next belt test. I also love to play as Bruce, because of his Muay Thai style of kickboxing. I have practiced that style too and it is very powerful. So I guess I understand the characters in the game, and they were very well done in respect to the martial arts style. If you have a playstation 2, buy this game. If you don't have a ps2, buy one and get this game. P.S. - I'm 19, so I'm young enough and skilled enough to attempt to kick like those characters. If you haven't practiced, YOU WILL HURT YOURSELF! If you like playing fighting games, you would probably like training in the martial arts too. So go take lessons. P.S. - Hworang means ""flowering youth""."
4,Only Second to Tekken 5,"One of the best fighting games I have ever played. It took me quite some time to get used to this fighting style and game play with my street fighter experience, but once I did I was hooked. The game soundtrack stands out to me as one of the best, if not the best game music I have ever heard. This game only stands second in my mind to Tekken 5 as a fighter in complexity, originality and intensity, which make it a fun and classic game to play if you like fighter games.Although it's nowhere near as enjoyable as Tekken 5 is now, it was a great game for it's time when it first arrived on the scene. I have to give this a 4 out of 5 stars, because I know if I just started playing it now for the first time, I know I would love it all over again. Although, I think fighting games could be much better, I still think this is a unique series, which deserves mention as a classic in the midst of all the other great titles of the past and present."
4,"Just one thing missing, better yet make that two","I really did like the Tekken Tag Tournament game, which is kind of like an appetizer in between Tekken 3 and 4. There were all the old and new charcters to choose from, some of whom I havent seen in a while, so it was fun to use them all over again, with improved quality of graphics. It really makes this game hard to turn off. The only two charcters I noticed missing were Craig Marduk and Steve Fox from Tekken 4, so I guess they weren't developed yet. However the main two gripes I had with this game was the storylines were really cheesy and did little to explain anything. The second thing that this game needed was a Tekken Force. I could imagine using one of the Gun Jacks or Unknown against the Tekken Force baddies. But that's pretty much what I had to do. Imagine. All in all, this is a good game when you want to kick some butt and call it a day."
4,Great graphics! ...or are they?,"I love the Tekken series, it's my favorite fighting series and the graphics keep getting better and better. The only problem is that the endings aren't FMV! Grr.. All that work to beat it and you aren't even rewarded with graphics! Or sound! It's the same song for all the endings. The only ending without that same song and that is actually FMV is Unknown's ending. Otherwise, it's a great game."
4,great game,"i have recntly played this game and im impressed its better than i thought. the control is great and the gameplay is fun and exciting, and the graphics ar excellent. I however was dissapointed that the ending scenes were only about 30 secs long.They do have a diff choice of costumes in the cutscenes but they are still all the same. the extra modes are mediocre. The hidden characters are wut u wanna get. This is the only reason i didnt give this a perfect score. This is a title u definetly wanna get if u want a great fighting game."
1,Whats wrong with this game?!!!,this is just like the other tekken games. the tag is just horrible. if u want a tag game get DOA2. that game is way better
4,Real fun but gets boring kind of fast,"I loved Tekken 1 - 3, but this one bored me a bit. The graphics are amazing and I've unlocked a great deal of bonus things but I don't think game will be much fun anymore unless I have friends over to play. The hidden bowling game is fun and I'm sure I'll play that more than the normal game."
1,Tag Me Out!,"Wheres the 3D motions? Wheres the excitement? Wheres my refund?I bought it, I played it and then I stuck it in a time capsul and buried in my backyard. Hopefully Tekken 4 will have some, I don't know,uhm entertaining qualities you deserve from a PS2 game!"
3,New Characters Please!!!,"I'm a great fan of the Tekken series and when I saw this latest incarnation I was a little disappointed. Granted, the graphic effects such as the snow falling on one level, grass thickets on another and all the cheering yobs/practicing ninjas in the background look really pretty, but they don't do anything for the gameplay. I found the game to be noticeably slower than Tekken 3 on the PlayStation (PS-..., PS2-...). My main gripe however was the lack of new decent characters. For starters, old crappy characters have been resurrected (Lee, P-Jack, Jun) when they already have counterparts that have identical moves. Panda and that ridiculous Kangaroo are still present, and who honestly picks them? The final boss is also very uninspired. I'd consider this as Tekken 3 with small bells and whistles rather than a sequel to Tekken 3. Four games in a row with the same characters is getting more than a little dated."
2,Tekken is disappointing,"I was disappointed with Tekken Tag Tournament. The graphics no doubt are great, but as far as the gameplay goes, players will be disappointed. This game in no way compares to the gameplay of Soul Calibur for Sega Dreamcast. Soul Calibur dominates Tekken, mostly because of the 3-D, 360 degree movement allowed. Tekken does not use this, leaving the game too basic, and the controls frustrating. Soul Calibur's player moves are amazing and quick, but doing combos in Tekken is a bit of a task, and the movements of the characters don't move as fast as you press the buttons. This game could be a lot better, but for now, your best bet is to save your money and wait until Soul Calibur comes out for Playstation 2."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE !!!,"This game is Tekken 3 with more characters and better graphics. There are no gameplay advancements apart from that, except the bolted on 'Tag' feature. Yep no 3D movement, like Dead or Alive 2 and Soul Calibur, or any of the other innovative features of fighting games since Tekken 3 was released all those years ago. The Beat-em-up has moved on in the intervening years but this game hasn't. It's the same mock 3D game underneath the wrapping that was released five years ago for the Playstation.If you are indeed a 'serious' games player then you can spend your money on far superior games than this. Don't be fooled by the mindless adulation heaped upon this game. If Tekken is your bag baby wait for Tekken 4, It'll wipe the floor with this ancient relic (hopefully)."
3,For people who like fighting games...,"If you like fighting games... then this is for you....personally, i'm not into them... however, i did enjoy soul caliber for the Dreamcast since it had a long and intersting story line......"
2,wait for tekken 4,"The game seemed to play waaaay better on the arcade. Sure the graphics are great, and the new moves are cool enough, but the speed of the game has been dropped. If you play TTT and then try out Tekken 3, you can tell that there is a significant speed decrease in TTT. Plus the ending movies are absolute [crud] and Tekken Bowling is a joke. Buy this game only if you wanna impress friends or if you actually like the slow play. My best opinion would be to wait for Tekken 4. I have Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 and I've completely beaten both of them, so I'm not bias towards the series at all."
3,Not as good as I expected,"At first the game had graphics that I thought couldn't get any better, but when I saw the movies, I was very disapointed, because it looked just like the gameplay graphics, and the begining movie looked real. I beat the game with evrey single character, and saw the same old corny, short, messed up, no meaning movies. The movies lacked the great real 3D graphics of the past Tekkens. And The game puts up no challange, even on Ultra hard. And A big problem is u lose after 1 character is K.O.d. And it has nothing to do with the Tekken Series. The good thing is they brought back good old Tekken 2 characters(including my favorites Kazuya, and Lee) and it offers Tekken bowl. And they, as always, make the fighting graphics look great. If u love Tekken 2 and Tekken 3, this is a game for u. If u haven't played Tekken in a long time, this game welcomes u back with a warm reception, but if u want a Tekken game with meanin' wait till Tekken 4, cumz out September 27."
5,Awsome starter game,This is a great game to start out your collection with. It is fun to play by your self and even funner to play with friends. i highly recomend it for everyone.
4,The best of Tekken and a preview of what's to come,"It's not very often that a console game actually exceeds it's arcade counterpart, but that is exactly what Tekken Tag has done in every way. The movement is smoother, the combos let loose with ease and the graphics are absolutely astounding.New to the Tekken series is the Tag-team mode, in which you choose 2 players and can switch between them at any time during the match. Personally, I like it... it allows me to use varying attack styles during the game and always keep an opponent off guard; however, it also means that you must now learn a new characters fighting style and moves in order to be fully effective... an undertaking some might not be comfortable with.Undoubtably, Tekken 4 will surpass all previous titles, including Tekken Tag; but in the meantime, Tekken Tag gives us an incredibly solid, entertaining game to play and shows us just what is possible on the PS2. It's a game that absolutely no PS2 owner should be without."
3,I miss Street Fighter 2,"This game is definitely not bad, however, I think the old Street Fighter 2 is much more fun. I admit that I haven't learned all the moves, but you don't need them all to beat this game. You can just random button press and beat the game. I don't like that. On the positive side, the graphics are good and there are a lot of secrets to unlock. It's not bad, just not great."
5,I LOVE TEKKEN TAG!!!...,"I basically don't like fighting games, as I'm a big fan of sports games, but alot of my friends aren't, so I decided to get a fighting game that I would like and my friends would too. So I went out and got this. It was the best decision I had ever made. 30 characters if you beat the game 14 times and when you beat it 10 times, you gain access to something called tekken bowl which is a bowling game (in a fighting game?) that you can play. Fun for the whole family. Anyway, it easily gets 5 stars. Oh, and here's a tip... BUY IT!!!..."
1,never got it,i never got the product i waited for it the whole time it never came to me and i want my money back for this product
5,One of the Best Games Ever Made,"I've played alot of games, alot. In my opinion this both the best fighting game ever made & the best game to play if you only have two people (although you can play it with up to 4). Most of the game mechanics are easy to pick up, but there is enough deep techniques to keep the game interesting for years. Essentially the game is an incredible expansion to Tekken 3. If your new to Tekken this is the perfect game to start at."
4,Functionality,"No doubt that the look and feel of the WATCH is real good!!!4 stars for that.....As far as the functionality is concerned - I was a bit taken aback as the time was not as perfect as it must have been for a brand like NAUTICA.The DAY on the watch does not change when the time is 12AM. Instead it changes when the time is 3AM.Quite Bizzarreee...NAUTICA - Its not just imp to have a great looking product. But, a product must also meet the basic expectations.When you are selling a watch plz make sure the time and date is displayed correctly....I am not returning it back as I wanna gift it and don't have much time.....Still I go for 4 POINTS for the following reasons:- No other brand has such a light colour- Decent price on Amazon- On time delivery!!!Reasons which may disappoint customers:- Basic functionality of the watch is DISAPPOINTING!!! :(- Very bad package. Airbags used were flattened out."
2,Not worth it!!!!,"I spent $60 on this watch, just to have it break after a month in a half. This was such a waste of money!"
5,This is a terrific resource!,"I HIGHLY recommend this to all teachers, including home school parents. This resource includes not only an excellent lesson plan, but also a large, colorful map poster of Lewis & Clark's journey. The background information is interesting as well as informative and the worksheets/activities are simple to do, cover various learning styles, and reinforce the lesson. Well worth the price!"
4,cute!,"Besides being adorable these things are super warm too!wish they had a bit higher heel but really, they are awesome"
5,Warm & Comfortable!,It fits me perfectly. I love the fringe and my friends say it's so cute! I'll share it with my daughter.
5,Takes a special cast of mind but...,"Funniest book I own. Especially the piece ""Ariminta Ditch"" (by John Lennon) and my favorite: ""Brain Damage.""Brainy, irreverent, FUNNY."
4,Ferry is back!,"Very good release by Ferry Corsten. ""Punk"" mixes a dark bassline with trancey riffs and is quite different from Ferry's previous projects. The Radio edit and vocal extended mix are great. The Kid Vicious remix gives a nice, lighter tune, while the Cosmic Gate version adds some thumping beats. More underground stuff with the Duplex mix. If you like this song, I would recommend you check Suburban Hell on Blank & Jones' Substance and Laurent Garnier's Dangerous Drive. Enjoy!"
4,does its job. wish they offered more flavors...hmmm,"i bout a couple of these, they last a pretty long time and the smell isnt over powering. it does a great job of hiding smells like garbage and funky bathroom smells. they last, so a great value here. just wish they came in like a great vanilla scent or citris...not a huge fan of berry--but it does its thing."
2,Perfumey Smell,I purchased this to try and get rid of a musty smell from my old cabinets. All I notice is a grape/berry smell being emitted from the product. Doesn't seem to be absorbing any odors.
2,odor genie ordor/ dampness eliminator,"I found that this product worked reasonably well. I used it in a musty bathroom. It had a pleasant order. I found that it did not last long, and have since found products that work better"
1,sickening smell,"I used this product under our sink, next to the trash. While it may have gotten rid of some odors, it really mostly just covered them up with this awful berry smell. At first it was sort of nice. After a week, it was pretty powerful. After a couple weeks it was unbearable and I finally threw it out. If the door or drawer was left open even a crack, that awful smell would fill the kitchen. I don't see this complaint in others' reviews, so maybe I just got a dud, but if you are sensitive to smells at all, I'd try one of the others that does not have it's own smell. The whole point is to eliminate odors - not create new ones!"
4,Great air changer,"Bought this for my husbands car as i would no longer ride in it as it smelled like ""stinky Boy"" even my kids didn't want to ride in it anymore, within 24 hours of putting it in there it smells awesome. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was that the ""berry"" smell in such a small area like a car is a little more potent then i like, but over all we can all ride in his car again=) will be buying more in the future."
5,A Season in Hell : Illuminations,"It's been well over a century since Arthur Rimbaud penned ""A Season in Hell"" and ""Illuminations"" in his native French. It is said by many that ""Illuminations"" was the most complex collection that Rimbaud wrote in his short span of writing, but this translation by Mark Treharne truly captured the essence of Rimbauds work. ""A Season in Hell & Illuminations"" embodies Rimbauds thoughts and state of being at the time with his amazing use of metaphors and grasp of the written word. This book is definately a must have for the most zealous Rimbaud fans and new readers alike."
1,dirty and used,ball arrived covered in dirt (that washed off) and smudges that didn't. ball was nearly flat and was clearly used
4,lack of pitures.,"I hoped threre are lots of pictures in the book when I was shopping it, unfortunately a lot of description showing up, only can make a imagination about how they look like."
4,Mencken Is Missed,"An excellent, insightful book, covering the ""Sage of Baltimore"" from cradle to grave. What keeps my review at four stars is that Ms. Rodgers could have included more passages from Mencken himself. Of course, much of his work remains in print, but in a biography of this length more selections from the man himself would be been welcomed. Still a fine effort."
2,Forget this - not worth it,the little lamp fell apart and I could not get it together to work again. The light it provided was inadequate anyway.
2,Not a best buy,"This is an attractive volume which will disappoint most readers. The text is difficult to read and needed a good editor, which it did not have. Photos and other illustrations are plentiful, but placed in locations far from the relevant text. Artifact photgraphs are sometimes out of focus. Production issues aside, the author (an expert on state formation in Mesopotamia) does not have command of prehistoric periods and these sections are already outdated. A specialist in Mesopotamia will find things of interest, but there are far better books for anyone else. Finally, the price is outrageous."
1,Ready to Bomb: The Sequel,"This game's graphics are improved, but that's about it! No originality and the game looks like a nine year old slapped it together ten minutes before it was due."
4,Decent boxing.,"Hey, where else can you get in the ring with boxing gloves and beat the ... out of Michael Jackson? Enough said, now I know you want this game. So go get it!"
1,Get Ready to run,Stay away from this game it is terrible. I liked NFL BLITZ a lot and thought that this may be a bit simmular. There are a lot of differences but the main one is that NFL BLITZ is good. With terrible sound play control and too little characters this game bites the big one. Do not even rent it.
1,rumble 2,if u liked the first one you wont like this one dont wast your money this game is a flop i have maddin ttt espn track and field i love sports games i wouldnt wast my money ill just play the first one thanks
3,"Fun, for about a week.","This is the sequel to one of my favorite Dreamcast games. There are new boxers featured and even some suprise celelbrity charecters such as Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and Shaquille O'Neal. The graphics are nice and a little cartoony and the music is pretty standard. Voices in the game include Michale Buffer's ""Let's Get Ready To Rumble"" line and more standard voices ofr each charecter. The Arcade Mode is a fun knockout fest complete with ridiculous charecters and extremely realistic bungie cable physics. There's also tournament mode with training sessions which are little button tapping mini games that get kind of annoying but it's stil fun to build up your charecter and ot fight in scheduled matches. Multiplayer is great, only 2 people but its still quite a bit of fun. The game is a nice attempt for a sequel but it gets old really quick."
2,"Nothing new, nothing fun","I really see no reason to buy this game, you can beat it within 45 minutes if you can even stand playing it that long. Its only remotely fun when you play in 2 player mode. The characters add some spark but not enough to save this horrrible game. If you lik boxing, you might like it, but thats abouy it. Youll get bored with this game very fast so i highly reccomend knockout kings instead of this. There are much better ps2 games out there, so get out out and explore, just esort to this as a rent."
2,This game is nothing like the first edition,"This game sucks compared to the first one. I had a lot of fun playing the first one and when I first got my PS2 it was one of my first games, Ready to Rumble 2. I would not suggest for people to purchase this game or even to rent it. That is how much I dislike it. However if you are thinking of purchasing it I would strongly suggest renting to see if you actually enjoy it."
2,Ready To Stumble...,"As a new PS2 owner, I found this title fairly disappointing. Most of the graphics are pretty good, and it can be fun to play against others for a few rounds. However, the game really falls apart with its inconsistencies of play, and one-player gaming is an exercise in futility that no gamer should have to endure. At critical moments in the game, your controls can simply become unresponsive. Unfortunately, you never know when this bad programming symptom will strike. This game must have been rushed to market, as nobody in their right mind would release this thing as being bug-free. More frustrating than fun, it's a purchase that I regret making."
2,Product shipped was NOT AS pictured !,"A different type bird food was shipped than what was pictured and different than what I needed. My bird, a conure, eats the ""Kaytee Exact Natural"" a brown pellet form for PARROTS & CONURES. She has done well on this and I was happy to find it on Amazon. Hope that the product and picture of it gets corrected so that I and any other customer might get what they need in the future.Wayne Elmore"
3,It'll pass,"I consider myself knowledgeable about bird food and I know Exact has an excellent product. Our African Grey and Macaw had been eating this food for several years. I have always bought large bags of food and stored it in smaller sealed containers so I don't recall precisely what I bought the last time. After several minutes I selected food for ""Parrots and Conures"".The food was smaller than I thought it should be. A cockatiel could eat this stuff.I will know better next time but buyer beware."
3,A true love/hate reading experience,"The book is broken into two parts, and after completing ""Part 1"" I felt it was masterfully written and very original. ""Part 2"" was a crashing letdown I'm sorry to say. The honesty of the tale in ""Part 1"" that made it so interesting is completely tossed to allow the TV-movie-of-the-week melodrama to unfold in ""Part 2."" The actions of the characters, particularly the cop Les, in ""Part 2"" are so ridiculous I became irritated with the author who had impressed me so much earlier in the novel. I feel he could have come to the same sort of inevitable tragic ending without the ridiculous melodrama we end up with in ""Part 2"". His editor should've thrown the ""Part 2"" half of the manuscript back at him and yelled, ""Re-write!"" A real disappointment. How could a book with so much originality and honesty be saddled with such a phony-baloney conclusion?"
4,"Don't Know Why I Liked It, But I Did!","I just could not put this book down! But all through reading it, I got more and more depressed, and wondered why I continued to read it, since I hated almost all of the characters! I found I was in a bad mood all through this book. But I continued to read and hated to get to work in the morning (for more than just this reason!) and canceled lunch dates so I could keep reading it! Go figure! Was I reading it to see if even one of those people I hated ""got"" what was coming to him/her??? Was I happy with the ending??? NO! I'm just sorry none of my friends read this book so I could discuss the psychological ramifications! It's a great read, but I don't know if you'll be happy with the end result."
2,...,"I enjoyed much of the development and history of the main characters. The writing itself is above average. However, the deputy sheriff is so unbelievable that he should be satirized by comedians on Saturday Night Live, or by some anti-establishment hate newspaper. He would have been fired long before he could have brought hurt to anyone. This is a man sworn to uphold the law, yet he manages to plant evidence, be a coward, leave his wife and family for a trashy harlot, and also manages to get the harlot back with substance abuse. Thank goodness for the colonel, and his sense of values and honor, even though contrary to Western standards at times. This book took me almost two weeks to finish, but I figured that... Oprah liked it, maybe there would be a redeeming conclusion. Not so...readers save your money. Before I am called a non-realist about life, I have never come across so many losers in such a short parameter of time and space, and all over a house."
2,Good FIRST half.....,"Yes, with those who say read the first half and skim the second, I hole-heartedly agree. I fould myself intrigued with all characters as the book began and started to develop, but as the second half began I became suspicious. I, too, was wondering what the purpose was of switching the narative point of view.Toward the end, I found myself wanting the Behrani's to keep the house and move on with improving their lives, and I wanted Kathy to move on and out of her old patterns and drop the ""Burdon"". The fact that Lester turned into a hostage-taker really threw me. What a loser this guy (Lester) is! I felt like Lester and Kathy got what they deserved. I skimmed the last few pages as well, and it left me wondering why I read the book."
4,"A fine, sensitive realist novel","Yes, Dubus III is the son of Andre Dubus, the noted short story writer. But father and son have different, distinct styles. This novel is almost hyper-realist fiction. The characters are explored through extremely detailed descriptions of their thoughts and actions. A little slow at times, it nonetheless works, and the novel is deep and moving. I must, however, comment on our fine friend, Mr. chapleen@hotmail.com, who has posted a one-star review below. He admits that he hasn't even read the book, and is angered by the use of the word ""sand"" in the title. I have no problem with his critique, but this is no place to review a book for its title--especially if you haven't even read the darn book. Please don't waste our time, sir, and have a little respect for the author."
4,wonderful characters,"I highly suggest this book. It is not the type of fiction I'd normally pick up, but I was interested in how the Persian characters would be portrayed for a class I was developing on contemporary immigrant experience in the U.S. Clearly Dubus is not too familiar with Persians, so the result was that the background information on the Persian family seemed textbook-ie the political affairs in Iran and the attitude of the family. It would have been more interesting to see a different representative of a Persian family of that status.I found that the Colonel character was a one-dimensional borderlining a stereotype. Way too much emphasis on the tea, food and general persian lifestyle that would leave a more ignorant audience to think that Iranians were only concerned with tea after dinner, designer goods, position and exterior monetary wealth. I find that while I have these complaints I thought the writing was good--worthy of including it on a supplemental course reading syllabus."
3,Kept me glued to the book,"I'm not one to read a lot of books. In fact, too often I start books with good intentions and don't quite finish them. But this one kept my interest from beginning to end. However, I was floored by the ending, and was quite distressed by it all. Upon reflection, it is masterfully written, in the tones of two entirely different people from different cultures, each good people in their own ways with good intents. The author does a remarkable job portraying their unique cultures, in their own ""lingo"", which in itself kept my constant interest. Always hopeful of a mutually happy ending, and in constant awe as to how it was going to end, it did leave me cold, and ready for a lighter, more humorous book next time!"
3,House of Sand and Fox,"I agree with the readers who thought the first two thirds of the book really sucked you in, but thought the last third somewhat disappointing. At first I found myself not being able to put the book down, but that turned into just hurrying to get the thing over with.What I think killed it for me was how Kathy went from someone you felt really sorry for to someone that you really didn't like much anymore. It's really hard to feel sorry for someone who has an affair with a family man and then turns back to alcohol and does some really stupid stuff. I also had a hard time believing that a man like Les would risk so much for a woman he's known for such a short time.Overall, I guess I really did enjoy the book, but it would have been more suspenseful if I felt equally drawn to both characters, but I ended up cheering for Mr. Behrani."
3,Thanks a lot...,"Marvelousmom from Salt Lake City, if you're going to post a review, please keep crucial plot points out of it so those of us who want to read the book (or see the upcoming movie) can go into it without already knowing the outcome! Sheesh!"
2,"Read the first fifty pages and the last fifty, skip the rest","I really enjoyed Colonel Behrani's voice and perspective as a character. If the entire book had been told from his point of view, I might not have skimmed through to the end. I lost interest as soon as the author took us into the voice/mind of Kathy and her relationship with Lester. I don't enjoy 'victim-fiction' which is why I haven't read many of Oprah's latest picks. Kathy seemed to fall into that stereotype and Lester's fall into her stretched my imagination too far. I hope Mr. Dubus will write another novel using the strength of the voices he captured in the Behrani family...I'd look forward to reading it."
3,Not quite believable female characters,"The concept is great. It could have been a much better read had the characters been just a bit more believable. Mrs. Lazaro, who loses her house, is the weakest character, and the male author just doesn't quite ""get"" the female psyche. It is not believable that she would not sue the county through her ""sliding scale"" attorney (who was more than willing), and, in real life, the female attorney would likely have told this client to take a hike after the unnecessarily rude treatment she received. The read left me wishing that the plot had been thought out just a bit more because I'm certain that there is a vastly better book here really wanting to happen. This would make a great movie with some rewriting that is more in touch with women."
1,What was Ophrah thinking????,"Don't get me wrong - I love Oprah, but where does she come up with these books? This is one of the most awful, disturbing books that I've read and I can't wait for it to END ALREADY! The characters were all self-absorbed and I never cared about any one of them, even when Andre Dubus III was desperately trying to coax me to like this bunch of losers.Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you want to read a really good Oprah pick, choose one of the Wally Lamb books. At least he has a sense of humor....."
2,A Book I Wished I Hadn't Read,"This book is a paradox. On the one hand, the writer obviously has talent. The writing itself is good, the characters are well-drawn. The author gives us a glimpse into Middle-Eastern culture that is quite interesting. But the characters act in ways that are simply incredible over and over again and it hurts the books credibility. They are also soulless. For this book to work as a poignant tragedy, the reader must come to care for these characters--and I believe the opposite happens. They are the architects of their own disaster and the reader is only able to stand apart and watch, incredulous, instead of being drawn in. So the tragedy is a minor hiccup in the universe, not a moment of universal truth. If you want to read about the fall of a noble man, read The Great Gatsby. If you want to ponder the naturalistic universe, read Theodore Drieser. Don't read this. I taught English for 17 years so I would like to think this is an informed opinion."
1,A short story gone bad,"Plodding, dull, self-absorbed, depressing, a waste of talent. These are just a few of the things I could say about this god-awful book, but why waste your time? You get the message. There is not one likeable character in the book, including Esmail. You learn to hate each character very quickly for their selfishness, their supreme vanity, and their wasted lives. In fact, you're almost glad they all end up dead at the end (even Kathy is ""dead,"" as she has been most of her miserable life). This sad excuse for a novel should be avoided. Shame on Oprah for recommending such tripe."
1,Don't waste your time on this tripe.,"I soooo wish someone had warned me about how awful this book was before I paid money for it. The novel is dull and pointless. It's about two ugly, nasty people and their fight over a home they both feel they own. The characters were unlikeable and not particularly interesting. The novel dragged all the way through. The only reason I kept reading is that I figured there had to be a reward at some point. I thought the author would finally live up to all the dreck written on the book's back cover. But, alas, Mr. Dubus never delivered.Please don't waste your money, or, more importantly, your time reading this poorly conceived novel."
1,Hated it,"Relentless in its exploration of the intersecton of two characters and their downward spiral. If I hadn't been trapped in a plane with nothing else to read, I would have never finished it. If you enjoy watching car wrecks occur and the ensuing aftermath, this is the book for you."
2,"Wooden dialogue, silly plotting, shabby characterization","This book is a poor excuse for literature. None of it rings true. The Persian character is a stereotype, and his way of expressing himself is stilted and not credible. The plot is a mess. The characters are shallow and not believable. This is the equivalent of pulp fiction. Why read this when there are truly talented writers like Joyce Carol Oates and Kazuo Ishiguro plying their craft?"
5,Dubus should win a Pulitzer for this one!,"Just read it! It is literature. It is easy to read. It is writing at its best. It is brilliant, emotional, heartbreaking, infuriating, involving, hell, its everything. Just read it! I couldn't put it down."
2,The last Oprah book I will read,Why are the Oprah book choices so consistently depressing? I don't think one must be continually dragged through the muck in order to see the light. I find it odd that the TV show focuses on more upbeat topics while the books she chooses are such downers.
3,Just Too Wordy,"The book catches hold in the early half, but just too much detail for the second half. It was just too steep a ride to the ending."
1,Not worth it,"I will admit this book was very well written. Maybe it was too well written in that I grew to intensely dislike Kathy, couldn't believe how stupid Lester was to the degree he got involved with her and ruined his life (good grief, how was she worth all this heartache?!), and while the colonel may not have seemed a very sympathetic character, I found myself rooting for him. I didn't find the ending satisfying at all & wished I hadn't wasted my time."
3,House of Sand & Fog Review,"I thought it was very good, especially showing the viewpoint ofthe Iranian family and the challenges they faced in America. I feelfor them as they long for their old country and the way things used tobe. I think Les and Kathy were very typical American.... I amgrateful my family is not like that but so many people are. I thinkthe author did a great job but I could see some things cominglike.... So, it was interesting and kept me reading but it was not the""unbelieviable suspense"" it is billed to be.... In anyevent, it was a good book. If one is still thinking about it 3 or 4days after finishing, then it is a good one, and I find myself stillthinking..."
2,What a Downer,"I admit that Andre Dubus is a skilled writer and that I certainly was drawn in.How could there be that many losers in one story.Of course I finished it expecting that on the next pagesome uplifting event would occur.By the end I felt like I had been sucked into a spiral mudslide.This may be what Dubus intended, but not what I look for when investing my time in a book.I feel like I should go back and re-read Jane Austen to feel clean again."
3,Needs more character development,"Well, I read this on the recommendation of my wife through Oprah. While the book was easy to read, the only character to be developed was the owner of the house, Behrani.With much of the first half of this book dedicated to developing the characters, Dubus misses the mark. He could have better developed Burton and the main character.Logic usually rules over emotion with me. Thus, the whole central backdrop of this book, the house, and the wrestling for control over the house missed. Sure, it was an intriguing story but it's my opinion the common person would be furious not at the new owners but the county. Moreover, the result would be a major lawsuit against the county.All that said, I could see this book as a great movie. With a little more dialog from Burton(perhaps with his wife and kids), Behrani and Nick, Frank and the rest of the family, it would be an intriguing script and movie."
2,Talk about a downer!,I was really disappointed in this Oprah pick. I'm not sure that I will be able to force myself to read the last 30 pages that are remaining in the book because I am really getting tired of all the mess ups that everyone is making in the book. Kathy goes into a downward spiral that isn't totally believable. And what's up with Lester? He started out being pretty ok but has lost all reasoning to give up a family and career in a matter of days. I don't buy that. I liked the book at the beginning but about 1/3 of the way through it got so slow and boring that I've only continued to read it in an effort to get a return on the purchase price. Sorry Oprah!
5,Breathtaking Page-Turner!,"I found this book incredibly compelling because, for a variety of reasons, every character is in the right and every character is in the wrong. This leads to a thought-provoking morality conflict where it quickly becomes apparent no one can win. I did care about all of the characters, which were well-developed. In fact I cared so deeply that I literally held my breath for the last 50 pages and had to flip through the end of the book to find out what happened so I could begin breathing and reading again. This is truly one of the best books I have ever read."
3,"Great Set-up, Dull Characters","I picked this book up with a lot of expectations: my grandmother gave it to me with rave reviews after seeing the author at a reading (my copy is even signed!), the author lives in the town I grew up in, and I recently heard a great interview with him on the radio about his life and relationahip with his father. So I dove into the book expecting something that I never got. The plot was very unique, and Dubus set up a wonderful situation, but I felt that he filled it with entirely unbelievable and unlikable characters who were initially sketched as interesting and complex but ended up flat. Almost everything that came out of the characters' mouths was a stereotype, especially the woman main character, and the more I read the more irritated I got. This said, I think Dubus is a wonderful writer. His style, his setting up of the place, or the situations is remarkable. I just think the characters and dialog got in the way of fleshing out the story."
4,House of Sand and Fog,"It is hard for me to pick who I symphathize more in this novel, Kathy or the Colonel. I feel the author has given the reader a great insight to both character's feelings. Kathy feels she has to hold on to her family's heritage. The colonel feels he must hold on to the house to make and nice profit for his family. He wants to give his family back a life that they had to leave behind by coming to America.This book kept me flipping the pages and before I knew it I was at the shocking end."
1,Very Upsetting,I was so excited to read this book after Oprah highly recommended it. What a disappointment? This book made me so angry. It was a horrible display of badgering someone who is of another culture and trying to make an honest life for himself in the United States. Horrible book and such a poor choice for Oprah!
1,What a disappointment!,"I had heard so much about this book and was dying to read it. As another reader mentioned, it started off with a very interesting plot and detailed characters but turned into a truley miserable book. It was unbelievable, depressing and pointless. I kept reading hoping it would take a turn for the better but that never happened. I was deeply disappointed when the book was done that such a good premise turned into such a dumb story! Don't waste your time."
4,Great Literature,"Friends who had tried this book were divided - one thought it was great, another thought it was too ""dark"". I found it moving and beautiful - the plot grows out of the people's characters, and they are sympathetic people."
1,"Horrible, Depressing, tragic","I usually try to read the books in Oprah's bookclub, most of the time they are very good and you can relate to the characters themselves as well as the struggles they are going through. However, I found this book terribly distrubing, and disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and I would think twice before ever picking-up another book by this author. The only reason why I finished the book is to see who ended-up with the house."
4,Quit reading after twenty pages...but,"The House of Sand and Fog can be a bit of a chore to read (small print, dense writing), but after twenty pages, when Kathy is introduced, the story takes off. It zips along to an ineveitable conclusion, but there is plenty to see along the way; a lot tension and hard packed confrontation keep it alive. Andre Dubus III deserves the critical acclaim he has recieved. Even if you didn't like his book, it is still a plausible and scary account."
2,House of Sand and Fog,"Kathy was a bore, the kind of woman I'm really tired of reading about. I would like to see this in a short story form. There was way too much driving and drinking and feeling sorry for oneself. I would add this to the very long list of bad women books. Not a page turner but a page closer."
5,good reading,"I thought The House of Sand and Fog was a tragic, but well written story. I liked how the story of the house dispute is given from both sides.Officer Burdon is not unlike many people who do stupid things in the name of love.My only complaint with this book is overinformation during the sex scenes.Other than that, great book."
3,What Promised To Be A Good Read,"I just finished reading this book and I'm in two minds about it. The first half of the novel was a good read, I couldn't help but like all the characters, but come to the last 150 pages or so the story and indeed the characters just came unstuck. By the end of the book I really came to dislike both Lester and Kathy, but I never came to dislike Colonel Behrani. I just think the consistancy of the characters lost shape as the book progressed, and the events that ultimately happened just didn't seem realistic to me. What I really hated about Lester, which showed he didn't really care for Kathy, was his encouraging Kathy to drink again knowing she was a former alcoholic. I guess the author used literary licence to a degree, but the novel to me was unrealistic and the end was disappointing."
1,House of Stupidity,"I greatly enjoyed reading the book to a point. It was fast moving and a real page-turner with interesting characters, especially Behrani. But after three quarters of the story, it began to fall apart, its seemingly intelligent characters behaving in incredibly stupid ways, especially Burdon, the responsible FTO police officer. I was looking forward to some trouble and then, perhaps, an interesting resolution, but no, the story took a nosedive with the important characters displaying extemely poor judgement, rash behavior and gross stupidity. Ultimatley the book was not believable and very disappointing. Shame on you, Oprah, for recommending it."
2,Unconscious Living,"This book was a great example of people living their lives backward in a state of unconsiouness. Esmail, son of the Behranis was the only innocent victim in the entire story.I guess I can only recommend this book if you want an blueprint of how not to live your life."
1,Boring!,There are many many books here at amazon.com that are worlds better than this. Since when is Oprah supposedley so deep and profound?
2,Kathy is a creep; Lester too,"OMIGOSH, how is it possible to hate a person who has had her home taken away erroneously (but I did hate her)? And to hate the 'noble'(lascivious) police officer that comes to her rescue? Even though Kathy lost her home due to ignoring important mail regarding taxes, I found it so difficult to sympathize with her. That creep Lester had NO redeeming qualities; bullying Col. Bahreen while pretending to be an officer was deplorable--Not to mention jumping into bed with the 'poor victim' almost immediately. So, faced with the dilemma of whom to root for--I found myself feeling guilty for supporting Col. Bahreen."
2,Couldn't Wait for it to End!,"This book fell completely flat with me. I'd read reviews and had received positive personal reviews and so I was really looking forward to cracking the bind!When I began reading it, I liked the mood and was drawn in. But soon found in very draining with the lack of motion in storyline and the droning on and on from the main characters. It frankly, became unbearable, and I skimmed the last 40 pages or so, and I hate to do that!On the up side, the story itself has much potential, I just felt the author spent too much on non-dialogue, ie. many, many pages were of the characters' thoughts and memories. Normally, this doesn't bother me, but in this case, it caused a chasm in the storyline that left me bored."
4,GREAT READ,This is a great story of tragedy. I found it an easy read and couldn't put it down. I finished it very fast because the writer keeps the story moving. Very good writing as the characters are strong and easy to imagine. Highly recommended.
2,Check it out from a library,"Do not spend money on this book. It is well-written, but as other reviewers have noted, the plot is too unbelievable at the end.I grew to dislike the characters so much...perhaps that was the author's objective."
2,"Linear, exciting towards the end, but....","The book basically depicts the clash of two individuals and one family all star-crossed and fate entwined in an embroilded situation. Each page is a narrative of trains in an ultimate but predictable collision which you can speculate to have a metal twisting explosion. The story gets al little bit exciting towards the latter part, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Immigrant experience is the only redeeming feature of the story,"The story drags. It is depressing, as others have written. Multiple layers of tragedy, but the most compelling perhaps is the tale of prejudice experienced by the family. There are better ways to spend time than reading this book."
1,Worst thing I've ever read,"I don't mean to be ugly, but this was one of the most depressing, uninspiring books I have ever read. I understand that the Oprah book club thing is about books that maybe don't have uplifting endings but the ending on this one was just overwhelming. I didn't find a redeeming value to it at all. I actually felt depressed when I was done. If there was a message (which I am sure there was and I even believe I slightly got it), it was drowned out by the futility of the entire story. Again, I don't want to be ugly but I absolutely hated this story."
3,What a downer!,"Although this book is well-written and superbly paced, the fact that the main characters are so unsympathetic detracts from its readability and suspense. With the exception of Behrani's 14-year-old son, everyone in this book is self-destructive, selfish and shortsighted. Their lives are out of control, sometimes to the point where you just don't want to hear about it anymore; they become boring in their outrageousness. I found myself not caring whether either Kathy or Behrani got what they wanted in the end (which removed much of the suspense), and I actually felt some relief when I put the book down, though what I mostly felt was depressed and discouraged."
1,Felt like I needed a bath after this one!,"This novel was chosen by my book club... Our overall review was a resounding thumbs down. It starts off promising enough with an interesting premise, and did hold my attention till about the halfway point. Then something strange begins to happen to the plot and the characters, they both deteriorate to the point of ridiculousness. I was especially amazed with the character of Lester, who although seemingly portrayed as a loving father engages in such inexplicably reckless and stupid behavior as to certainly result in his children being minus their daddy. The novel is also gratuitously interrupted with raunchy ...descriptions that sound like a junior high school boy and his friends were penning the scenes. Save yourself the aggrevation and don't bother with this one."
3,Get Real,"Although I find that at times I want to keep reading this book to find out what happens, I find it completely boring throughout. As an attorney I am baffled at this storyline as any law suit she does have is with the county. Otherwise, the cheating cop boyfriend who admits his breaking laws ""for the good of all"" is completely absurd and desppicable. I ahve read many of Oprah's books prior to this one and find that her books just seem to get more and more depressing."
3,Ugh!,"This book is indeed a page-turner. It is enthralling and difficult to put down. It is well-written, and the characters are believeable and engrossing. I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other. The book does draw you in. However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss. My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible. My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable. And really, I should have known. The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated. So, this was a good book. But take heed: there is no happy ending here. Nothing to feel good about. No hope at all. None. So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read."
1,I hated this book,"I felt angry and depressed when I bothered finishing this book. The characters were at first compelling, but by the end despicable. The plot was very thin- not enough to justify the 300 + pages. A short story would have been sufficient to tell these sorry characters' tale of woe. The author included several vivid descriptions, as if they were added for a writing class assignment. The voices of characters whining and worrying over and over was irritating. I didn't quit reading because I hoped something would happen. The ending destroyed all faith in humanity. Don't bother reading it."
2,Cheap read,"First of all, the author writes from two perspectives he knows little about, a drug addict woman and and Iranian immigrant. The depiction of Iranian culture was a complete stereotype and often inaccurate. The transliteration of Farsi phrases would have been tedious for those not familiar with the language. Kathy, the female protagonist, is a cookie-cutter character from a cheap Hollywood flick and is hardly convincing. My second problem with the book is the overly-descriptive and far too frequent sex scenes. These scenes could have been done tastefully, instead, are disracting to the plot. Rather than constructing what could have been a fine peice of literature, the author has put together a cheap read."
2,Fails on many levels,"Not to be picky, but first of all, the law is that since the county never owned the house, since they made the mistake that started this whole mess, they can't auction it, and in real life the sale would be taken back whether Behrani agreed or not. But aside from that, where the author fails badly is that he does not make Lester or Kathy synmpathetic characters that I care about. I feel nothing but contempt for them, and throughout the whole story wish they'd go away and leave the Behranis alone. And no, I'm not Iranian or even close. The story just spirals uncontrollably downhill to such an extent that it was not believable. And the end is ambiguous, maybe intentially. I have no idea what happens to Kathy at the end. But since the author has made me not like her I don't feel sorry for her at all. This could have been done much better, but it's obvious that the author is talented, and his next effort can be considerably better than this (I hope)."
2,This Book Is OK But Not Great,"The author penned a good picture of how different the ""family"" oriented foreign people are compared to the ""self"" oriented American people are. That's the only thing that kept this book interesting, other than that, I really thought this was a rather slow read. Most of Oprah's books are terrific but this one isn't that good in my opinion."
4,"chilling in its realism, haunting","I found this book disturbing and depressing, but very, very interesting and unusual. It's a good, solid read, hard to put down and very absorbing. Reading about America through the eyes of a Persian, and in such a realistic way, was well worth the time."
4,compelling read,"I felt that many of the customer reviews I read captured quite successfully what I wanted to say so I can only add that this is a book that totally captivated me...yet knowing that as I got deeper into it that it would result in a tragic and disturbing conclusion -- but the characters Dubus presents here --particularly the Colonel, were so ""real"" that I woke early this morning to finish it -- it was as if it was my duty to read it and complete it knowing that I would be saddened by its resolvment but still compelled to complete it. A most unforgettable story that will stay with me for quite awhile."
3,"An American--no, universal tragedy","Everyone,with the exception of the Iranian's wife, is imprisoned by culture, pride, injustice. SUCH A SAD STORY. I FELT that the PROTAGONIST was choosing to live at the end by communicating with the others."
3,Characters are unforgetable,"Dubus has a talent for creating characters that come to life that is what I really liked about the book. However, there is one point where the story just takes a turn and you are thinking, what the heck, that doesn't make sense...its like Dubus couldn't think of how he was going to end the story and just created an outlandish twist."
3,Train wreck waiting to happen,"That's how I felt all through this book about it's characters. They were all such wrecks. I almost enjoyed this book, but after a while I had a hard time taking the stubborness and bad judgement of the characters. The characters were so totally messed up and didn't see the escape routes in front of them. Towards the end, while I wanted to know what would happen, I could only read a chapter at a time because I was so repulsed and disgusted by the main characters. And the ending...it felt like Dubus wasn't quite sure how to resolve everything. It wasn't badly written but I could barely take how pathetic the characters lives were."
3,Interesting...sort of.,"I found that this book drew me in and was hard to put down. But I've yet to decide if it's something I suggest others read. I felt Dubus did a good job of making us familiar with the two main characters, and you really do feel very sorry for them. They are both SO desperate and made me thankful for how ""normal"" my life is. I felt myself having very strong feelings about the continuous careless decisions both characters made. However, at times I felt I was reading into a bad soap opera with steamy sex scenes that seemed irrelevant to the story. And of course the tragic ending that everyone talks about left me unsatisfied and sad. It was a bit of a surprise for me, not the quality of something I expect from Oprah's book club."
3,"A lesson to be learned here, and lots of tension!","I got pulled into this book by Dubus' amazing ability to create tension. Tom Wolfe did the same in A Man In Full. These people are walking on the very edge of life, and I just had to see how it ended. I kept thinking to myself, ""This is what happens when people rely on THINGS for salvation."" It made me wonder what I would do in this situation. The tension was palpable, and it was a very enjoyable read. Great for vacations or long trips by plane, car, or boat."
3,loved 80%. HATED the ending,"I thought this book was very well written. I enjoyed the first person narrative by multiple characters. The characters were not so likeable, but they definitely were interesting. I was raving about the book to people while I was reading it - ""I'm reading this really great book right now!"" Then came the ending. I like complicated endings. I like emotional endings. I do not like endings that make you feel like you need Prozac. Bleak, very depressing ending. If you like that kind of thing, this book is for you!"
1,!que horriblE!,"this book was poorly written, the characters were shallow stereotypes and the story was stupid."
1,Dysfunctional City by the Bay,"By sheer willpower, I managed to get through 60% of this book before heaving it into the fireplace and watching it finally bring a little heat and light into the world. I am sure that is a happier ending than the author had in mind for his work, but it was the best I could manage under the circumstances. Not a single character in this book is worth wasting your time getting to know. If they lived in my neighborhood, I would move out at night with no forwarding address !"
1,House of Emptiness,"I started reading this book with high expectations. I like reading books that leave room for the imagination. Half way through, I realized that I developed no connection with the characters. I didn't care for Ms. Nicolo and her cop boy-friend and more disappointingly I didn't like or sympathize with the Iranian family although the book's whole story line suggested that I should have because these poor people are foreigners who came to U.S.A by being forced out of their own country due to the regime changes and they are home-sick and trying to make a new living in this totally strange country with its strange rules, odd lifestyle etc. etc. I felt that the book was limiting my imagination by forcing me to read it as if I were watching a very predictable movie. I guess the author had a movie script in mind and arranged the whole story with that perception. Flavorless and a very empty book."
3,Didn't like the Characters much,I chauk this book up to another weird Oprah selection. She knows how to pick 'em. I just didn't think the characters were very reasonable. They just let their emotions take over. I was hoping for a more satisfying ending. I was hoping somehow a cooler head would prevail and tragedy would be avoided. (I am still hoping for a new ending to Romeo and Juliet.) Once Lester got it wrong there seemed to be no way out. The tension just escalated. I thought the ending was extreme.
5,Read the Book BEFORE Oprah added it to her list,"Andre Dubus III is a masterful story teller. I have been a fan of his books since he first started to publish. This Jack of all trades (including house painter, carpenter etc.) can weave intimate detail into an incredibly beguiling story.His latest book ""House of Sand and Fog"" is another good example of his story telling technique. He takes the time to develop the characters from the inside out. Making you believe, care for and understand their predicament, even if you don't relate to or understand their actions.These types of books are few and far between, and even farther between now that Andre's late father (Andre Dubus II) is no longer writing.Read this book, reread this book, talk about it, pass it on. It lives an independent life from your own. Try to understand it and you will better understand yourself."
1,could have done without this book,"Far be it from me to go counter to Oprah, but I found this book overblown and way too depressing. Just when you think it can't get worse, it does. This isn't one of those good, sad books in which you eventually see what it all means and why all the mess was necessary. Instead, you find yourself wishing the characters would show a little common sense, wishing the author had more heart, wishing you had never picked up this book.I love dark novels, but this one left me gasping at the utter lack of respect the author showed his characters and his audience."
5,Should Have Won the National Book Award,"I bought all the books that were nominated for fiction; and was pretty impressed with them. But this one was beyond impressive. House of Sand & Fog is an extraordinary book, with the most complex and disturbing character development I have encountered in a while. Dubus' sensitivity toward the diverse cultures he writes about is extremely moving. Easily the best book I read over the last year."
3,House of Sand and Fog,"I liked this book. I found myself looking forward to reading it each night. But,...it did start to drag on a bit and the end was a little bit of a downer. I kept hoping for someone to be happy in the end!! I am not sorry that I read it, or paid the money for the book, but i would hesitate before I recommended it."
4,A Tale of the Struggle for the American Dream,"In this novel, Andre Dubus III manages to intertwine the lives of two extremely contrasting characters through his masterful command of storytelling. In the book, one character, an immigrant, struggles to achieve the American Dream while another, a recent divorcee, struggles to maintain hers. Brought together by a single house, the characters discover each other, and, more importantly, themselves."
4,Great character development,"Great character development - had me rooting for two opposing sides within the first 50 pages with no possibilty of a compromise. Dubus does a great job weaving this story. I do, however, have to take issue with the lack of response from the county government, but accuracy here would've killed the plot, so ... on with the story."
3,Suspenseful but...,"A very engrossing book and a true page-turner. The writing style of alternating first person narration is very effective and book is well paced. Character development is excellent - The Behrani's are sympathetic characters who's lives are torn apart by two of the most birdbrained, pathetic creatures ever to show up on a printed page.This is the flaw in the book. I cannot believe that Lester and Kathy could possibly be so dim-witted. If an underlying objective of this engaging novel is to mock California, Mr. Dubus was fairly effective. So as not to give the story away, I will only say that the convergence of ineptness between a county, lawyer and protagonist with a deputy who's despicability is rivalled only by his lack of judgement is hard to believe.At the end of the book, the implausibility of the Californian characters stupidity kept screaming not just ""fiction"", but ""parody""."
5,"Excellent writing, great story, fascinating characters","Told from dual and opposing perspectives, ""The House of Sand and Fog"" is intelligent, suspenseful, compelling and thought provoking. Once read, it's impossible to forget these unique and realistic characters, they're like none other in literature. Even the minor ones are memorable.Both narrators are relatable, well drawn, distinctly different and each flawed in unique ways. The suspense builds when the main characters challenge each others right to ""the house"". Both have a legitimate claim but it's their personal investments--one reaching for a brass ring and family security, one holding on to the end of the rope-- that force them into a ""win at any cost"" mentality. This is a great book to discuss with friends since readers inevitably pick sides themselves. As the story develops and the tension escalates your favorite character will probably switch a few times as well."
3,Not my cup of tea.,"This is one of those books people tend to either love or hate - a little like Cold Mountain in the polarization of the reviews. And, whereas I loved Cold Mountain, House of Sand and Fog was not my cup of tea. I couldn't relate or even care much about any of the characters, which is odd, because I have really related to other characters in Andre Dubus' writing.The book focuses on the different meanings that a certain house takes on for people, people that include a former addict who was the original owner and a once powerful disenfranchised Irani immigrant, and as the story progressed, the house takes on a role of its own in this well written but (for me) ultimately dissatisfying and depressing cultural clash."
4,Intriguing and full of suspense,"Wow. This was not a book I would have normally bought just based on the description, but I'm so glad I did! I found myself in the lives of three individuals, all of whom I felt sympathy for, but none that I just truly liked. This was great, since I couldn't decide who I wanted to be able to keep the house in question. All of the charachters are flawed, and it's nice to read a book without a hero for a change. The end was a true suprise- one that I would never have guessed. I was never bored while reading. The pace is quick, and the story flows well. I highly recommend this book!"
3,"HIGH ON HOPE, LOW ON SATISFACTION","I began this book with high hopes, which sadly it failed to satisfy. In part I guess that was because the story is something of a contrivance, in part because the author seems unaware of the purpose of paragraphs, but mainly because none of the characters truly came to life, and therefore none engaged my sympathy. I felt relieved when the story finished, and I did not feel curious about what the future might hold for those of the fictional characters that remained. The fact that the text has since become the subject of a post-colonial and feminist tract speaks volumes."
3,What was all the hype about?,"This book by no means sucked me in... I struggled in the beginning, but hung in there. I don't quite get why it was such a hit...oh yeah, Oprah uttered the title... It it an ok story. The author's desciptive style was enjoyable and I could certainly 'picture' exactly what was happening. I found it slow and draggy with not a lot of pulp. It came highly recommended to me by a male friend, he let me borrow his copy, I am in no hurry to own it..."
4,Couldn't Put it Down!!,"This is a great book written by a talented man. I admit the dustjacket story line seemed farfetched and uninteresting to me at first. Once I started the book Mr. Dubus' writing and character development drew me in and kept me engaged to the last word. I was struck by this book and his exploration of the dark side of human nature (thankfully fictional in this case). I stayed up til 4 a.m. on a ""school night"" to finish it; how many books can you say that about?"
2,"Not a relaxing read, for sure","This was one of the most disturbing books I've ever read, but I can't say it was poorly written, just that I didn't enjoy it too much. I did like the way the author educated us readers to the ways of the old world while also portraying how some modern-day people live. I didn't like ""seeing"" an innocent family that minded their own business and took advantage of an auction, get dealt such a terrible hand. Just not my idea of a good book to read."
3,"Easy read, bad ending","Ever flip channels on the TV on Saturday afternoon and get sucked into a somewhat intriguing movie only to have a terrible ending that leaves you irritated that you just wasted two hours of your life? Well, that would be this book.I'm from San Mateo County so that sort of made this book more interesting to me personally. It is a good, easy read if you aren't looking for depth or true literature. I fairly enjoyed it up until the ending. It's like Dubus got going on a roll and then just died at the end.Is it worth the read? ... END"
2,House of Absurd & Ridiculous,Oprah needs to broaden her taste and choices in books. This one is so unbelievable it's difficult to describe. Absurd characters... ridiculous ending.
2,Disappointed,"I was also disappointed in this book and my comments are similar to the other negative ones. I did hear Oprah talk about the suspense and how it kept her on the edge of her seat. I did not feel this way at all! In fact, I bought it since I knew it would take months to get it at the library and I think I finished it because I bought it! I love to read and like nothing better than that feeling of not wanting to put a book down. This did not happen with this book. I did not like any of the characters very much and thought it was not at all suspenseful until the end. I also thought the very end was just flat and didn't leave me with any feeling of finality."
3,"Great Premise, unbelievable ending","I was intrigued by the clashing of two cultures, and by how the two main characters became intertwined. However, the climax and ending of this book were pretty unbelievable. Upon finishing this book, I found myself saying, ""yeah, right."""
1,Not worth reading,"This is a tedious grade B or C book that wouldn't make it as far as a made-for-tv movie. The characters are one dimensional, the writing flat and cliche-ridden (eg He had the: (fill in one) softest, deepest, darkest, warmest brown eyes I had ever seen.) Far more shocking than the ending is the fact that this was a National Book Award finalist."
3,"Interesting read, annoying characters","Overall I enjoyed the book, but I kept thinking a resolution was on the next page, but that didn't happen. In fact, it kept getting further and further from a resolution. One minute you cheered for the colonel and the next minute for Kathy. I did find myself getting very frustrated with the characters, the colonel's stubborn pride and how stupid Kathy and Lester could be."
1,Disturbing,"This book is why the moral integrity of our country is going quickly downhill. The unacceptable behavior exhibited by Les, Kathy and the Colonel is described in such pitifully self-serving detail that one only hopes readers don't try the same games themselves in real life.The message I got was that it's okay to play the victim and seek revenge.You would think Oprah, of all people would understand the incredible power of suggestion from books, media, etc. There will always be people writing about sad, sick people and things but the last thing we need are influential voices endorsing them.Don't waste your time reading this and don't waste your money supporting the Oprah ""fan club."""
4,Sand and Fog,"I thought the book was wonderful, suspenseful, and hard to put down. But....the ending was very disappointing. I expected a different ending."
2,Reality check,"This book is ideal for taking on an airplane. It reads quickly, demands little attention, and concludes with very little to ponder. The first section is well written and promises some interesting insights into immigrant culture, but then the novel deteriorates into a largely unbelievable plot that is suitable for a movie of the week (which is probably why this was even written, and which explains the disturbingly pornographic sex that appears at predetermined intervals) The reality check is that I at first told a Persian American woman at work how much she might enjoy the book. By the time I finished it I prayed she would not recall the conversation. The ending so badly stereotypes people as to be embarassing. Overall, however, it will make the time on the plane pass."
1,"Just because Oprah likes it, doesn't mean I have to....","Life in general has enough drama and conflict in it. I read to decompress and escape for a little while each day. This book was not an escape, but more of a torture. I now vow to stop reading after the first three chapters if I am this unhappy with a book again.This was a deep well of wallowing in self pity and expectation of something that never appeared.Perhaps the author needs some anti-depressants. Then again, seeing the sales numbers, perhaps not."
2,I've got to stop listening to Oprah,"I bought this book because I caught a show where Oprah claimed it was one of the most phenomenal books she had read to date. Well, I've just got to stop listening to her. I've enjoyed very few of her recommendations. The characters are depressing and the storyline is frustrating. You just don't care what happens to them, you read along in awe that none of them consider going through the proper channels to rectify their problem..."
1,Worst Book I've Read in a Long Time,"I grabbed this book at the library, solely because of the Oprah's Book Club logo on the cover. I have enjoyed Oprah's choices in the past, but not this time. I agree with other reviews that the first part is okay, but don't even bother reading the second. All of the main character's were despicable. The plot was thin and unbelievable, and the ending was just plain horrible. I ended up just skimming the last 50 or so pages to get it over with. Two big thumbs down!"
2,unforgivable inconsistencies,"This would be a great novel if there hadn't been the glaring plot hole in Chapter 3, when the Yellow Moon Owl is first introduced. I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't read it. It is still an interesting read...I would have given it a 4.5 or a 5.0 were it not for the Yellow Moon Owl inconsistency. But because of such an inexcusable flaw (which will rear its head later, starting in Chapter 9 and snowballing from there), I cannot give this book more than 2 stars. Mr. Dubus, I suggest you get either get a proofreader or concentrate more on doing your research on Yellow Moon Owls."
3,If you're going to use actual place names...,"then get the lingo right! Even Kathy and Lester--a police officer who drives these very streets daily--get it wrong. Any Northern Californian (and there are millions of us!) knows it's called the ""El Camino"", and not the ""Camino Real"" or the ""King's Highway"". Don't even think of calling San Francisco ""Frisco"" anywhere in the Golden State. These were not a case of the Colonel getting it wrong because he's new in town, but clearly a result of comandeering a location without any knowledge or affection for it. I found these errors, and others, very distracting."
1,Trivial - disappointing - far too simple to be interesting,"The writer choose to demondtrate the cultural clush in the Bay Area between two marginal extremes; The story is simple and un-interesting. Simple, easy reading, that will not even make you give-up the movie [that you have already seen twice] on a cost-to-cost flight."
3,Desperate,"I thought the writing was good and that the author did an excellent job creating tension. I was captivated by the characters from the first chapter, but their desperate actions and irrational behavior left me feeling bleak when the story was over. I cannot recall a moment in the book when a character stepped aside to see the lunacy of their behavior. Rather, they are completely self absorbed in their own private crisis. Which perhaps was the authors purpose all along.Despite this, I would read another book by this author. And perhaps pick this one up again if I need something to make me feel normal!"
4,Surprisingly Wonderful!!!!,I really did not know what to expect from this book. Once I started reading it I could not put it down and finished it in only one day!! This is a great book and will keep you glued to the bitter end!
5,A Skillfully Written Dilemma,"Beautifully written page-turner that was so dramatic it kept me up at night...This book is too good to pick apart over technical issues...That's what a rousingly good story does, causes people to THINK!Not just the story but the writing here is first-rate. Dubus knows how to get into the heart and soul of a character without being obvious about it. He's terrific!"
5,Unpredictable Brillance!,This book was a mirror of real life in its portrayal of how one can get so caught up in a disagreement that has spiraled out of control and soon forget what the disagreement was about because it has turned into so many other things. These characters were orignial and the events of this book were unpredictable. I want to thank the author for introducing me to this family whom I otherwise would not have ever gotten to know. I loved this book and recommend that everyone reads it!!
2,Disappointing,"As a native of the state of California and a resident not far from the Bay Area, I was constantly frustrated with the inaccurate names and placements of cities, rivers, and towns. While the story may have had some redeeming qualities, my attention was drawn to these inaccuracies.The story is depressing and at this point, cannot bring myself to read to the end. I wanted the characters to stand up and fight for their positions. Instead, they whimped out to spur of the moment and stupid emotions."
3,Foggy brains cause tragedy,"The characters in this book rely on immature and selfish behaviour which ultimately causes more grief than I as a reader care to deal with. Lester and Kathy are pathetic. Lester's wife is the only lucky one in the book as she rids herself of a looser husband. THe characters all chose to see themselves as poor little victims instead of dealing with the situation as rational adults. It's amazing that people would sink so low, especially a member of the law enforcement community"
2,like gawking at a train wreck,"Synopsis: An irresponsible, alcoholic, home-wrecker hooks up with an adulterous, crooked cop. Together, they destroy the lives of a prideful, complicitous, wife-beater, his put-upon family members, and themselves. Compared to this, daytime TV is a cerebral experience. No surprise Oprah picked this one."
2,Average,"In my opinion, this book did not get interesting until its midpoint. It is very well written, but was so slow I felt like skipping to the last 10 pages to find out what happened (I've never done that). The revealing look at mid-eastern culture was interesting - I'd say that was the best part. I got so sick of Lester Burdon and his low level girlfriend Kathy. Also, Mr. Behrani seemed too angry and pompous to care about. Once again, the story got interesting at the midpoint because the action picked up, not because I cared about the characters."
3,decision-making,"I tend not to like books about people who seem incapable of making good decisions. And one of the characters in this book is definitely like that. She just never seems able (or willing) to take any responsible action. Realistic this may be, but it's also annoying.Another main character, on the other hand, tends to make good decisions. Decisions that are responsible financially, good for his family, and on the right side of the law. And yet, things don't turn out well for him either.If this is a book the purpose of which is to show how quickly things can spiral out of control, then it succeeds. Good decisions or bad, no-one wins here. Too many of us, who manage to have lives that are more or less in control, this is a valuable thing to learn about. But this is an awfully depressing education."
4,"Suspenseful, keeps you reading!",Events occur & become intertwined with one another. Dubus keeps you wondering where it is all heading. The book is easy reading & you have tokeep reading to FIND OUT what is going to happen! When NOT reading this book I found myself wondering what Kathy & Lester & Behrani (the main characters) were up to next!
3,Sandy and Foggy,"...Dubus found the ""voice"" of his main characters and the style of the book was brilliant. My quarrel is with the lack of reality check. What happened was a trajedy that probably wouldn't have happened had anyone been a little more sensible. All parties are portrayed as caught in a situation they can't seem to extract themselves from when it wouldn't have taken much. The county that took Kathy's house owed someone the fair market value for it -- it's that simple, and the whole mess could have and should have been straighten out without everyone's world collapsing."
2,two authors?,"The first two thirds of this book was evokative and persuasive, especially in creating the two sympathetic characters of the recovering addict who loses her father's home and the industrious, proud Iranian immigrant with the emotionally fragile wife who seeks a better life for his family in America. The last third of the book seemed to be written by someone other than the author who created these protagonists, someone concerned with plot and action rather than emotion; creating a morality play and perhaps with just getting the book done. I was entranced by the beginning and felt duped by the end."
1,nihilistic and depressing,"This book was quite disappointing. The characters self-distructed without reason, and the author never made me feel sympathetic toward them. If the author's aim was to say that life is futile and meaningless, it was well made."
1,A poorly written work with unbelievable premise,"In the first few pages I thought I might like this Oprah recommendation. The writing seemed to be imaginative and the study of cultural differences had promise. It was a promise never fulfilled. The book soon disintegrated into redundancy, with the same descriptive phrases being repeated again and again as though the author couldn't think of any other way to describe a person or scene. The book is filled with graphic, coarsely written sexual scenes which add nothing to the story and seem to be added for purient purposes. The characters are unsympathetic and the premise for the plot is unrealistic to the extreme.What could have been an interesting study of cultures in conflict absolutely missed the target."
5,One of the great works of modern American fiction,"A truly great novel leaves the reader with lasting images and impressions that haunt you long after you've finished reading. House of Sand and Fog is such a book. Dubus has drawn such real characters and situations that the reader is sucked into their world and never released. This is more than just an impressive novel, it ranks alongside the greats of contemporary American fiction and its unique style and multiple voices will set a benchmark for the 21st century.Those readers who were not stunned by this book have really missed out on a great reading treat. It is not a thriller, yet it is as compelling as the best James Lee Burke novel. The juxtaposition of cultures and narrative style may be difficult for some, but hugely satisfying for others.The best American novel since Underworld!"
3,A Modern Tragedy of Greek Proportions!,"If not for Oprah, this book may have been relegated to the list of under-rated but truly original works of fiction. Dubus has permeated this novel with a profound darkness and despair rarely seen in modern fiction, yet manages to keep the reader engrossed rather than overwhelmed. These are deeply flawed yet ultimately realistic and sympathetic characters, each of whom reach personal turning points which come together in a tragic intersection in the book's dramatic conclusion. Not a light read but a memorable one, which lingered with me long after it had ended."
3,ETHNICITY IS A REALITY...LIKE IT OR NOT,"Where one is from in the world makes a difference in your outlook on life and how you react to the challenges of being. This is well pointed out by this novel which has two narrators: a Caucasian and an Iranian. Usually foreign phrases and words turn me off, but when the Iranian is speaking and uses a foreign word the author immediately tells you what it means; that I was thankful for. The Iranian speaks different than the female caucasian and the two different outlooks on life is certainly worth the reading. For me the ending was quite implausable, yet didn't interfere with the story overall.As with most fiction (I do not read that much fiction anyway) there are holes galore at the end with a few sprinkled throughout the entire story.I read the whole book which denotes an interesting story as I won't read a book that doesn't hold my interest."
4,Indepth review of empathy for all characters,"I have been thinking about the characters in this book even days after finishing it.Each major character has a flaw, but the way that Andre Dubus writes about them and the situation of the house, makes you FEEL for every character, regardless of their moral behavior.I was impressed that I could feel for even Kathy Nicolo! I UNDERSTOOD her behavior even though I didn't AGREE with it. The same holds true for Lester and the Colonel. Because the characters were described so fluently, I could be any one of them and feel their rationale for their behavior.Great book! I was sorry for the ending, but again, I could understand each character's behavior, because of Dubus's indepth profile. He pulls you into each character with amazing brilliance!"
3,The Unappealing Parts,"I had a hard time picturing Kathy reminding the colonel & his wife of their beautiful daughter. What stood out in my mind was her smoker's breath, smelly body, & dirty clothes. I agree with the reader who did not like the name ""Les Burdon."" His crooked mustache and cowboy clothes made me think he was pretty gross to look at."
3,"It's Not Tragedy, It's Pathos","Why Oprah and so many professional reviewers loved this one is a mystery to me. It's a page-turner, no question about that, but it sure is depressing. The characters -- who are more pathetic than tragic -- reflect a sad blend of greed, selfishness, and obsession. Throw in alcohol, drugs, lust, and guns, and the only question is when and how it will all explode. It'll be interesting to see if this book makes it to the big screen. No one will walk out of the theater smiling, that's for sure."
1,Bird Cage Liner,"I usually find good in all books, but I can't believe this was published. The story line is weak and is based on a bunch of sitiuation tragedies that network TV would be embarassed to protray. It is full of unnecessary sexual content that reads as if a fifteen year old boy wrote it. Grow up Andre!!!"
4,"Loud Echoes of Steinbeck's ""The Pearl""","I liked the book, but I'm surprised that none of the above reviews mention that the plot is in lockstep with Steinbeck's ""The Pearl"". Behrani = Nino; the house = the pearl; Behrani's and Nino's wives plead with their husbands to release themselves from the evil house/pearl; and finally, in the ending, Behrani's son's fate is the same as Nino's son. Two good books, one plot."
1,Oprah... what were you thinking,"I should have read the reader's reviews before I bought this book - if I had I would have saved myself a bit of cash. Being neurotic I have to finish what I start and House of Sand and Fog or as I started affectionately calling it ""House of Sand and S#@*"" was a drag all the way through. I tried to convince myself that the meaning and mythic potential behind the gratuitous and ultimately boring sex as well as the poor character development was worth it but the author just didn't pull it off. One good thing - I discovered that I really do have discriminating tastes when it comes to books - Oprah has recommended some really good stuff before but this is definitely not one of them."
2,a struggle to read,"I read this book at the urging of my fiancee, who found it delightful. I struggled to finish this story. While I could not predict the ending, I found the entire book very slow and at times confusing. I did empathize with the immigrant wife and son. the rest of the characters were very disturbing and dysfuntional people. What happened to the original homeowner was her fault and the city/states fault. No one elses. The concept of the story was good the substance and writing could have been much better."
2,Such an incredible waste of time,"I have read all but seven of Oprah's book selections, and I have found most of them very rewarding. This one, however, is the grand exception!The story line was interesting and original, but the characters were grossly underdeveloped. By the novel's midpoint, not only did I not care what happened to them, but I simply just wanted them to go away! Dubus did not portry them in a manner that makes the reader like them or sympathize with them.Bottom line...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Read Joy Fielding's ""The First Time"" instead!"
1,Awful!,"It's hard to believe that this book was nominated for a major award, and that Oprah saw fit to add it to her book collection (a dubious honor anyway). This is a terrible book, with little to recommend or redeem it. The depiction of the struggle of the immigrants' lives was mildly interesting, but the rest of the story and characters were soulless and underdeveloped and unnecessary. Only a story that MUST be told should be told, and this story is not one that needs telling. I noticed that previous reviewer called this book as good as I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE. On that, I must agree."
5,Two Thumbs Up,"Don't start this book unless you have a lot of time, because you will forsake everything else to finish it. The story is told through the eyes of the Colonel, Kathy and Sheriff Burdon - each in turn giving their spin on the same set of events. The reader gradually begins to understand why these perceptions are so different but the characters never do understand each other. I couldn't help but think that if these three tragic people had reached beyond their own fears to look through each others eyes, the ending would have been much different. But I suppose it seldom works that way in life."
1,Depressing and bizzare.,"I have read several of Oprah's recommendations and like all of the others, this is an unusually weird book. I don't think she reads anything except this type of book. I did finish the book, only because I am stubborn and refuse to give up, even though it was not an enjoyable read. I do not recommend it to anyone, unless they are into depression.I will not read another of her recommendations nor will I read anything else by this author."
2,Like Watching a Bad Accident,"This book was overwhelmingly bad. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it managed to keep me interested enough to finish the book. While reading it, I kept asking myself ""How stupid can these people be?""I kept reading the book in hopes that any one of these characters would have some redeeming quality, but that never happened. They were bad characters from Page 1. Whenever I thought this book couldn't get any worse, it did.I had no sympathy for the main characters. They were pitifully self centered and constantly acted to their own demise. The character I came closest to feeling sympathy for was Behrani, but then the writer would invariably add a trait that would make me lose sympathy.Also, Dubus' style of writing in changing from first to third person was highly frustrating and unsettling. I wish he had just picked a style and stayed with it.I was very unsatisfied with this story and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
2,One-Dimensional Characters,"This story is told in 3 voices. Voice 1, Colonel Behrani, is an indepth character study. He and his wife and son are colorful, 3-dimensional deep characters.As for Kathy and Lester, the other 2 voices, they were not much more more than 1 dimensional. Dubus did not develop these characters to the extent he did the Behranis.I was disappointed in the gross mispronunciation of more than one main streets in San Francisco. This meant to me that proper research was not done by the readers (both).I was also disappointed in the monotone performance of the female reader. She was probably trying to be as one dimensional as Kathy, and she was successful.The story is a good one, brought down only by the lack of character development of 2 of the 3 main characters and naive performances."
3,Suspense at it's Best,"Great mystery and intrigue was built into the plot of House of Sand and Fog. The not knowing and suspense is what made this novel a great read.Dubus created characters that will continue to be very memorable long after the book is put down. At times the reader despises them, but turn the page and your opinion will shift again. The characters, Kathy, a needy woman; Lester, a cop on the edge; Mr. Berhrani, a former colonel in seach of respect in a new country, collide tragically in their attempt to maintain ownership of this house. For ownership means a new career and dignity for the Colonel and his family, and Kathy it signifies stability and progress.House of Sand and Fog captures the issues of dependence (emotional, physical, and substance), status in society, family, desperation, and immigration. The book challenges the readers values and morals.This was by far the least predictable book that I have ever encountered. A great read individually or for a book club!"
3,Thriller that goes wrong,"This started as a page turner for all the right reasons: character development, great writing, and suspense. It ended up being completely unbelievable and made the book a chore to read towards the end. How I wished they would just off themselves at a certain point in the tale. Glad to have started and not glad that I had to see it end like this."
2,Facts obscured by fog,"If it were not for the fact that this it my book club's book this month, I would not bother finishing it. I find the author's lack of geographical knowledge about the area very disconcerting. Secondly, the characters are not at all likeable. Some reviews have suggested that the book is not for those who choose to delude themselves with uplifing stories. I don't require an uplifting story, but I prefer characters to have some redeeming value."
2,"Boring story line, cheesy, and unbelievable ending","...The story line is boring--and I hate to use this term--cheesy.The Colonel was an interesting character--you loved him and hated him all at the same time. The author had clearly done his research. Lester and Kathy, on the otherhand, were poorly developed. The sexual references in the book are ridiculous. Like when Lester thinks of Kathy, is it necessary to give us graphic details of what he thinks about? That seemed completely irrelevant and thrown in for no reason.The ending was described as suspenseful, and that it was. I was in suspense wondering if it would really end this poorly. I just kept thinking ""this book is so dumb."" ..."
1,Incredibly draining,"I listened to the book on tape in my car, and found myself so depressed and anxious when I left the car. Kathy Nicollo is the type of person I would consider trash, and would not keep company with if I knew her in real life. A 36-year old woman who throws out notices about overdue-taxes ? Anyone who doesn't bother to straighten things out deserves what they get. Oh, and this woman has no female friends whatsoever to turn to when her husband leaves her and she is evicted ? Come on ! I found myself screaming at the character (my tape-player) and wanted to smack her in the face. Is this really what reading a book should be like ? The only thing that kept me listening was wanting to see her ""get it"" in the end, and I was robbed of that! What a disappointment.If you want to read a book about two people trying to get back at each other, where you actually feel conflicted about who to root for, read ""Kane and Abel"" by Jeffrey Archer. Dubus's book can't hold a candle to it."
2,"well written, but worth writing?","I was excited to get into this book... it seemed so promising. Clash of post-modern clutures, learning to live (or not live) with our neighbors, who are so different from us.But nearly half of it is about this one crazy man finally going over the edge. In that vein, it's nowhere near as good as 'In Cold Blood' (what is, right?).And in terms of culture clash, it's nowhere near as good as Crash (film, yea, but very thought-provoking).In retrospect, I wonder why an author from way-mostly-white New Hampshire would set his culture-clash novel in California. It could never happen here, right?"
2,Don't waste your time,"When I first started to read this book I could not put it down. The first half of the book was compeling. As the plot thickened I could not quite figure out how it could end in a sensible manner. Does Nicole get her house back? Does Colonel Behrani do the right thing or does his pride and ego interfere with his decision making and how about Lester, does he leave his wife and children? All these plots seemed intriguing and then the second half of the book is very disappointing. Its like the auther did not know how to end it so it goes crazy! Also, my lungs ached with every cigarette Nicole lite up. Was it necessary for her to do that constantly? I go the message in the beginning she was a chain smoker. Anyway, I was really disappointed in the ending. I was looking forward to a clever conclusion to a tangled mess. They either ended up dead or in jail. How convienient."
1,Corona is in SOUTHERN California....,"To all authors: if you're going to make up cities for your novels, please make sure that they are not already existing within the state! That was even more annoying than the references to ""Frisco"" and smoking in non-smoking restaurants. Makes one wonder how much of the other research is wrong.One of the bigger disappointments is the title--it leads one to think that the house is in some way special--it isn't, and why either party is fighting over it at all is puzzling at best.I read this because I thought, it HAD to be better than the movie (which, except for some of the acting, is just dreadful), it just had to be. But it wasn't.Don't waste time with either the book or the movie."
2,Not enough Dialogue,"I liked the Iranian characters - I enjoyed being able to see their culture from their eyes. Other than that, there wasn't enough dialogue in this book to keep me going."
1,Lost in the Fog,"This is a slow moving, long winded book that pretends to have a plot and story line but after you wade through the noring monologues and vacant dialogues you arrive at a few pages of excitment only to have the book comes to an abrupt and unbelievable ending that leaves you asking, What is the point? What a waste of time."
2,"Quick Read, yet disappointing","I read this book in two days. The book puts you in the middle of everybodies lives really quickly, and you get attached really quickly. I wasn't able to compare my life with them, the book is totally unrealistic. And then it totally left me feeling horrible and sad. I went to work the next day still (ticked) off. I thought after I finished reading it, I would have a good review, but alas, I don't. If you like extreme tragedies, this is a great book. However, if you like books that are real and don't leave you (ticked) off, don't read this book."
4,House of Sand and Fog,"As I began to read the book I felt - Here's another story of someone in deep trouble. The authors descriptions of the different events and of Kathy was exceptional. I did feel sorry for the colonel and I wanted him to have the good life he wanted for his family when he came to America. After all isn't the Usa the land of opportunity?? At times I was hoping that Kathy's husband Nick would come back in the picture to stir-up some trouble, but that did not happen. Lester did what he had to do with the situation, although I think he got what he deserved. In my opinion Kathy should have died at the end of the book however your the writer. The ending was not what I expected but then again you needed an ending."
1,Waste of time reading about these pathetic souls,"This book was terrible and I struggled to get through it. Finally, skimmed through the end so that I could finally find out what happens to these 3 individuals as they spiral through destruction."
5,Shanghai - Marcus,"House of Sand and Fog, by Andre Dubus III, is mostly a story of courage, shown by Mr. Behrani, the main character. In the beginning of the story, he is shown working at a construction site, where he continues to work after searching for countless jobs. This, alone, going from luxury in Iran, to dirt-poor-worker shows his courage, and willingness to work at any job he can get to help his family. Later, when Kathy Nicolo, an alcoholic he stole a house from, attempts to commit suicide, he takes her in, and nurtures her back to good health. I admire Mr. Behrani for all of his courage during troubled times."
3,House of Anxiety,"Dubus does a great job of developing his two main characters. Their first person narratives give the reader a real sense of their motives and an understanding of their - sometimes questionable - behavior. It is soon clear that these two are on a collision course and the reader's anxiety increases to an uncomfortable level near the novel's final pages. However, although the ending seemed inevitable, and Colonel Behrani and Kathy were quite believable, Lester's behavior was not easy to buy - this is the novel's only real flaw. An exciting read."
1,What a waste of time!,"I cannot say enough bad things about this book. Why ... felt it was so wonderful is beyond me! This book is poorly written with too many unneccessary characters/details when it wasn't important, and not enough good details where it was. The plot in and of itself is a bore -- all that over a house?! Women, especially married women, do not want to read a book where a married man is so 'gentle and warm' to his immoral, trashy, alley-cat girlfriend. The sex scenes are graphic and disgusting. GROWN WOMEN HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH THEIR TIME THAN READ THIS PURE GARBAGE. There was nothing uplifting or positive about the whole book ----> I quit reading it about 1/4 way thru and thumbed through the rest, looking for one good reason to finish. Found it never picked up; just got worse. The best place for this book is not on the bookshelf; it's in the garbage with the other trash. Got my money back from the bookstore."
2,Trying to be Shakespeare maybe?,"I liked this book for the first half or so. The characters were very intriguing and I genuinely cared how the entanglements would work out. But it gets so incredibly tragic by the end that I felt as if the author thought he was writing King Lear or Romeo and Juliet (minus the poetry). As I neared the end, I found myself needing to talk about it and related the whole plot to my husband, who sat there in disbelief at how badly things were going for everyone. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the ""romantic"" parts (i.e., the sex talk) was childish. The author's descriptions of how a woman thinks about sex struck me as a man writing about a woman's experience, and it just didn't ring true. In the end, I found the book to be not a gratifying read. Guess I'll stick to happy endings for now."
2,really annoying characters,"Though I had a hard time putting this book down, and the plot was grasping, I was constantly annoyed by the three main characters, especially the way the author developed Kathy and Lester, and their disfunctional relationship. I felt compelled to finish the book, but was annoyed throughout most of it."
1,Not worth the read,"Although this book is well written, the second half ruined what could have been a good book. When I was finished with this book I was very annoyied that I had wasted my time. I would not recommend this book."
2,"Well written, but&#65533;","House of Sand and Fog is the most stress inducing book I have ever read. It's the story of the battle of wills between two parties, Mr. Behrani, and Kathy Niccolo, over a little bungalow just off the shore in northern California. When a third party, Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon, steps in to help Kathy, the battle gets intensely out of hand, and everything snowballs uncontrollably until the disastrous finale.While it was beautifully crafted, and I marvel at how Dubus was able to wring out so much depth from such a simple plot line, the tensions are piled so thickly I couldn't appreciate the story--I was too stressed out! I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone, unless they felt they needed a little extra anxiety in their life."
1,Don' bother...,"Once again I feel the sting of having read a book, studying each line, reading each word...only to be disappointed. If you want to feel that you have spent several hours of your day in a wasted effort, i highly recommend you give this book a read. It leaves you unfulfilled, depressed, and somewhat confused. What starts out as strong character development and a study of a foreign culture disintegrates into sadness and misunderstanding. And i have yet to figure out the strong sexual undertones and graphic descriptions included in the book...perhaps i just don't get it. My mind is full of sand and fog...or maybe i just thought this book sucked."
2,a frustrating read,"This book, while well-written, is frustrating because of the foolishness of the characters, especially Kathy Niccolo. They continually make bad decisions that the reader can see a mile away, and consequently don't seem ""real."" For me, it's difficult to read a book in which I dislike most of the characters, and this one definitely falls under that category. I kept wanting to yell at them, to make them see the stupidity of their actions, and that does not make for a good reading experience."
1,worst book I have ever read,What a terrible picture this book presents! She thinks bad and sad thoughts and so she gets bad & sad things in her life. so sorry that this was recommended and that I took my valuable time to read it---a big mistake!!
2,Contrived,"Nobody does much of anything that's rational in this novel. And the climax is precipitated by a series of Hardyesque ""diaboli ex mahcina,"" from the dep sheriff's unnacountable actions in Behrani's house, to the even more unaccountable action of Behrani's son at the crisis.Some scenes are well done, but the plot creaks."
1,A good story gone bad and unreadable,"I agree with the reviewer who advised reading only Part I. The first part is gripping,well written and believable. Part II goes off into some strange action-adventure, machismo and totally irrational universe. None of what happens at the end of the book seems in keeping with the characters Dubus has created in Part I. I basically closed the book and skimmed the last 50 pages. It was so unbelievable and frankly, stupid, that I could not get through those last chapters."
1,* NOT For KIDS !!! *,"I gave this book 1 star, only because the review requires at least 1 star. This book was given to my 14 year old son to read for a High Honors required summer reading program. He read through the first 2 chapters and handed the book to me and said he wasn't going to read it. My husband and I then read the book and discovered extreme graphic sexual content, not just once, but, many, many times! The description of the sexual content is not done in a metaphorical way, it is exremeley graphic! I'm totally disgusted and appalled that not only did a teacher choose this book, but that it was approved by the Director of Curriculum! PARENTS BEWARE!!!"
5,Fantastic Movie - I just saw it,"I saw the movie tonight in NYC and it is amazing. I met the screenwriter Shawn Otto who did a great job turning a good novel into a great screenplay. Ben Kingsley does an amazing job as Behrani, proving once again he is one of the greatest living actors in the world.I believe Ben Kingsley will certainly be nominated for an Academy Award and the movie will also be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Jennifer Connolly and the rest of the cast do a capable job. But its hard to shine when you're next to the star of Sir Kingsley."
