2,Well-written but sap,"The text is simple, with common vocabulary and basic sentence structures. It is rich in description and humor. The characters are given distinctive backgrounds and attributes to make us like them. The mystery is simplistic, however, and ultimately all motivations in this book are one-dimensional. This is where detective fiction becomes soap opera, and not particularly well, but annoyingly you'll have to read until the end to find that out."
4,Great follow-up to the 1st Berger-Mitry Mystery,"The first book in this series had me hooked and this one was a great follow-up. Second efforts often fall short of the bar set in the first one. This, as in the first, keeps moving and has you guessing ""who done it"". The main characters are extremely likable and the story lines interesting."
5,Bennett's best,"This book covers some theories about how Gurdjieff recieved his knowledge. Specifically from Naq'shabandi sufi orders, and Tibet.My personal favourite from Bennett...as Bennett was chosen by Gurdjieff, as one of the few people who could realistically carry on the ""work"", and ""initiate"" others."
5,Background on Mr. G's sources plus more,"Although Gurdjieff never revealed his sources, he hinted at them over and over in his writings. Here we have Mr. Bennett, a renaissance man himself, who spoke dozens of languages, travelled extensively in these areas, had a personal relationship with G., and access to his family and friends. This is the ultimate Gurdjieff book about Gurdjieff that everyone who studies the Sufis, the Fourth Way, or Gurdjieff, must read, more than once.Mr. Bennett also gives insider tips and hints and previously unreleased material."
5,Tom is still the King of Cool,"Another great album from one of the best voices of all time. Very different from what he's done before, but then he did say it would be. Proper old school soul and gospel, and what makes this album even better is that all the tracks were done with Tom and the band all together at the same time, single take in most cases, and with minimal mixing and dubbing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to every Tom Jones fan"
3,Lord Help the Won Ton People,"You know I really wanted this album to work. But in truth it's as if Tom was singing the words from a sheet of paper. The material is great, the recording not bad, the musicians really good. But, there's no magic, no spark, no transcendent mood that takes it to another realm. It's like Tom is pretending to be a Gospel/Blues singer and then wants to walk out of the studio and get home. Tooo bad because I love Tom Jones."
5,"Loved him before, love him even more now.",This isn't an unbiased Tom Jones review. I have loved him since I was probably 7 years old and that devotion has never wavered. I couldn't wait to listen to this CD and it sure didn't disappoint. I have always said that he has one of the most beautiful and powerful male voices of all time. Listen to Praise & Blame and believe!
4,"Very good, but short of great","I like this album a lot, and Tom sounds amazing. But, for some reason the album doesn't blow me away. For that, I recommend the new Patty Griffin ""Downtown Church""."
3,Should be Praise & Shame,"Disappointed in the CD itself. The delivery was quick and was as promised but the music Tom Jones recorded for this CD is depressing. If you're looking for an uplifting, happy CD to listen to, don't buy this one."
2,Lacks conviction,"When Tom Jones sang ""She's A Lady"" or ""Delilah,"" did anyone doubt that he meant it? That's my problem with this album. I have no idea what Mr. Jones's beliefs are, but his voice here, though technically excellent, doesn't sound like he means what he's singing -- that is, what the songwriters were trying to convey. Instead, he just sounds depressed. Wish I could give the album more stars, but I don't believe he earned them."
2,TOM JONES PRAISE AND BLAME,THE REVIEWS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES WERE EXCELLENT. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF TOM JONES AND WAS GLAD HE HAD A NEW CD THAT WAS RATED SO HIGHLY. I PURCHASED IT AND LISITENED TO IT THREE TIMES AND WAS DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. SORRY TOM.
5,The best album of 2010?,"The five star reviews for this record are very well deserved. This is a powerful, powerful album, and may be the best record of 2010. The comparisons to Buddy Miller/Bob Dylan gospel music is spot on, with the added benefit of Tom Jones' extraordinary vocals (one of the most powerful voices in pop/rock music).This is not a hip grinding, Vegas-type Tom Jones release. This is a Tom Jones who is getting closer to meeting his maker, and he is preparing for his appointment at the judgment bar with some honest soul searching. It is gritty and soulful and real, and is a masterpiece that will pass the test of time."
4,another side of Tom,"Jones shows his roots and that he can sing with the best of them and not as an imitation, but from the heart."
5,Amazing album,I was interested in this album the first time I heard about it but it really just gets better every time I listen to it. His voice is stronger than ever and fits the songs perfectly.
2,very disappointed,"I have been a fan of Tom Jones for a long time and have every cd he has out, but I must say that this cd is a hugedisappointment and his voice has really lost a lot of his power. The music selection is not what I expected. Donot reccomend and I really do not like."
5,TJ is better than ever,"I'm not a religious person, but I love gospel music. This album has been playing almost nonstop since I received it. Tom Jones is better than ever. I would recommend this album to everyone. Religious and nonreligious.Jackie"
3,Refreshing,"Tom Jones was a huge commercial artist back in my younger days. I was never a big fan, I tended to listen more to rock'n'roll and jazz than Las Vegas type ""pop for adults"". As Jones has aged and fallen off the commercial, industrial hype, it seems he has become more honest and true to his inner devotions. I feel deep respect to what he does nowadays. This simple, folk-like and straightforward, minimalistic music shows that Tom Jones has integrity and inner strength.The album has much religious content, kind of gospel. I, not being religious at all, am numb to all that. But I am happy for him to have come home to his roots, and not budging to what has become more important for him over the years. I am glad that this powerful singer is still delivering, and thereby proves for anyone out there that there is no upper age limit for a good performer..."
4,Very good album but...,"Excellent album but when I heard ""Run On,"" the composition of which is attributed to Tom Jones and Ethan Johns , I knew I had heard it before. And , in fact , I had. ""Run On"" is pretty much , in lyrics and music , Bobbie Gentry's ""Sermon,"" from her album ""Delta Sweete,"" released in 1968 , which somewhat predates the efforts of Misters Jones and Johns. It's unfortunate enough that the greatly talented Ms. Gentry , as close as American pop music has gotten to the Southern Gothic of Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner , has been so grossly neglected , but to find that this neglect could be seen as an excuse for this sort of ""appropriation""... Jones and Johns owe Gentry an apology and some royalties. Michael Rawls"
5,A remarkable text,"This text is remarkable for what it does.The authours provide valuable information on the subject of early literacy instruction with particular emphasis on meaningful and balanced instruction.Every literacy specialist and early childhood instructor should read this book.I am a university lecturer who uses this book in my early literacy course with teachers in trainig and find it an invaluable resource.What's more,my students like the material in the book as well.I am surprised that I am the first to write a review of the book.Praises to the authours!!"
1,Terrible Just Terrible,Do yourself a favor please dont buy this book!!! save your dollars..this book will be better off as a paper weight!!
4,too small,"I bought a size 7 because thats what my daughter wears they were too small,you might want to go up a size if you by these. Otherwise they are made very good and my younger daughter loves them!"
1,Do not buy!!!!,I bought this for the purpose of using it while getting some exercise. The pre-set radio channels do not work and every time you move the cord to the earphones all I got was static! I sent back the day I received it. Safe yourself time and money!!! Pass this one by!
3,Heavy Going,"As a reader with a degree in English and a master's degree too, it dismayed me to have such a hard time comprehending At a Journal Workshop. Maybe I was looking more for quick exercises that I could use with my journal and that made me impatient with the heavy language and obscure concepts of this book.Perhaps the concepts of Twilight Imagery, Steppingstone Periods and Inner Wisdom Dialogue are easier to grasp in an actual workshop.More in depth than I wanted to deal with. I recommend The Creative Journal by L. Capacchione which I found sparked some valuable insights for me in my journal writing."
3,Heavy Reading on this Topic,"As a reader with a degree in English and a master's degree too, it dismayed me to have such a hard time comprehending At a Journal Workshop. Maybe I was looking more for quick exercises that I could use with my journal and that made me impatient with the heavy language and obscure concepts of this book.Perhaps the concepts of Twilight Imagery, Steppingstone Periods and Inner Wisdom Dialogue are easier to grasp in an actual workshop.More in depth than I wanted to deal with. I recommend The Creative Journal by L. Capacchione which I found sparked some valuable insights for me in my journal writing."
3,In need of an inner editor,"I cannot speak to the method itself, as I haven't been using it long enough. However, the book should have had the services of a good editor. Just b/c good journaling requires one to turn off one's inner editor doesn't mean a book about it should be written the same way! Needed someone to tighten up the structure and put signposts in the texts to help the reader follow the structure better."
2,VERY disappointed!,After reading the reviews for this I decide to purchase. Eventhough the price is reasonable ($16.10) the quality is much less than I expected. Very disappointed!!
3,Looks nice but quality of workmanship is low,"It looks nice on the wall in my new bathroom, but when it arrived I had to straighten the frame, because it was not welded straight. You get what you pay for - $18 is the right price for the product. If you need something cheap that's nice, and can wait for it few more days than expected + fix it when it arrives you should get it."
5,Five Acts can change your life,"This the fourth time I have purchased this book, I keep giving them away to friends. I have met Marta and found her to be an exciting and vibrant person. I love how the simple acts she describes can change your whole life. I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their life. It really works!"
4,A life of brilliance.,"The Courage to be brilliant is a book that gives us insight to our own life changing abilities. Reading and following Marta's excersies will make changes in your life that work and the ability to set goals that work daily, weekly for life. Continued use will give your life a brilliance that stays shining forever."
5,Truth and Wisdom Without Pandering,"I found Marta Monahan's book to be inspirational and thought provoking. Unlike many self-help books, it is well grounded in wisdom and common sense and doesn't pander to the reader. A person who studies this book is serious about making changes or they'll put it down. Honesty is the beginning of improving one's life and Monahan won't let you off the hook on this one. I recommend it, especially for men and anyone in corporate environments."
4,Great ideas for those who can't throw away yarn leftovers,"This book is lovely, presented in a way that makes me want to read it again and again. Because I normally plan my own designs, I found no patterns that I wanted to knit in this book. However, I found Sally Melville's concept for using leftover yarn inspiring. I have long been unable to throw away my leftovers and have organized my stash similarly to Sally's suggestions. I have found my own way of interpreting the information in this book and will certainly use some of the stitch and color suggestions. This book is a great addition to my library."
2,Boring Sunfire,"Typical Schurfranz entry in the Sunfire series where the heroine is very beautiful (and everyone comments on it at length) and can ride and shoot as good as any man. This time it's bow & arrow instead of guns, but that doesn't make much difference in the over-the-top ""grrl power"" formula Schurfranz employs yet again. The heroes are also slightly drawn (no surprise), with Cassie making her choice late in the story when we all knew it was coming. The biggest disappointment was Cassie's introduction to white society after being with the Iroquois since she was four. It is no more bumpy than the usual teenager switching schools. It could have been done so much better. I ended up speed-reading this one from page 100 and don't think I missed much. I hadn't the patience to read it as thoroughly as I have the other Sunfires."
1,Horrible!!!!,"Do not buy this stinky game!!! You can't get off of it w/o breaking your computer, and the game has no point!!!"
1,ease of use,"cant figure out how to use,instruction book not very good at description,need help to figure this out,contact me as to helping"
3,"Great on first listen, but doesn't hold up","However, it's a good, harmless joyride. WATER alone is worth a normal cd price (as are a couple others) if you're the type to buy a cd for one song. If you're familiar with the Merrymakers, Eggstone's similar. If you're into the quirk, Eggstone's worth a try, but don't expect a genious masterwork. But if you're like me, the move from harpsichord driven singsongy to housish psychedelia to crunching guitar riffs is worth it."
2,Careful with the Fit!,These shorts are great if you have a very very short torso. I own several other Giordana bib shorts and the bib straps on these are really mis-sized compared ot the others (about 40% shorter). I literally couldn't even get the bib over my shoulders as it barely went as high as my chest.Be careful with these!
5,Good towel,I received my towel earlier than expected. This made me really happy since it was a last minute Christmas gift. It was a good price. I was thrilled to find this off season item in December.
1,Is This For Real???,How hard is it to breathe heavily into a microphone? ANYONE can do this... I just can't believe some people actually get PAID for it!
5,THE BEST OF ALL,"This is the third copy of this set I've purchased. I have had mine for about 20 years and couldn't live without them. The others were purchased for friends that liked mine so much. If you ever needto be pointed to a direction, these are the cards. The scenarios presented to me over the years have proven themselves as the best and so accurate. Everyone will get inspired by this remarkable set.Keep track of your readings by date and see just how far you've come over the many years. It's a treasure that is well worth your time and energy. Medicine Woman ROCKS!"
2,"Absol Rocks! review by ""DisasterAbsol""","Yeah! Absol rocks! Just look at my username! I LOVE absol! This is such a cool toy but the scythe on the side of absol`s head is a little badly shaped... Oh,well! This toy is every absol fan`s dream! However, the Absol should have been made a bit bigger, and the ball rolling action is rather cheap."
3,"Good Pokemon, Bad Design.","I was pretty displeased when I bought this toy. I have always really liked Absol, but this toy made Absol look really bad. The Razor Wind attack is really stinky, and Absol's knees sort of pull outward, giving it a scrawny appearance. Also, Absol should be much bigger. Its really tons larger than Mudkip. However, I must compliment Absol for an accurate face. Mudkip is portrayed perfectly. It was well made with amazingly strong head- and tail-fins. I recommend this toy to Mudkip fans, though Absol fans might not like it unless Absol is seriously their favorite."
2,WAY TO SMALL!,"i was very disappointed when i got this toy because for its price, its just to small! absol is only about 2 inches, and mudkip is only about an inch. in the picture, it looked bigger."
5,Awesome!,Great looking. Great quality. Was going to go cheap and buy another one for $100 bucks and would have regreted it forever. Fly 1st class or stay home!
4,Solgar,"I like this product because it is especially made for women;Futhermore, the ingredients are all natural with no sugar and no starch."
4,Ineresting stuff...,"I always like programs from the History Channel. They do a very good job of gathering both the obvious information and the little-known background stuff. I particularly like ""Vampire Secrets"" and ""Salem Witch Trials"". Well worth the price if you're interested in the supernatural."
4,spooky collection,collection of videos on witchraft halloween vampires poltergeist and others. not the best but descent.
5,Good Buy,"I purchased this DVD set for a friend of mine who is into the hauntings, vampires, etc. She thought it was the neatest gift that anyone has ever given her! She loved all of the videos and claims they were very interesting and scary in some of them. Definitely worth the money!"
4,Boo!,A good show when on...a good DVD to have for Halloween! Not told to scare you but done in such a way as to inform and leave you wondering. Excellent product for those with a curious mind and don't mind a wink or two at the viewer.
3,Strap has problems,"I love the case, I bought the adapter holder as well. The annoying thing is that the strap has swivels on it that squeak when you walk. Sometimes I just hold on to the swivel to shut it up. Then I noticed that the strap hooks were digging into the nylon cover of the case. Then the hook, itself popped open and would not go back into a closed position. When you see it, you'll understand what can happen. There is not enough overlap in the hook. Its still a good case. I've had the case 8 months and use it all the time. I have to use the handle now though..."
2,It's an ok case if you only want a sleeve,"This case is good if you are looking for a heavy duty protection sleeve for your macbook. The issue that I found with it is that it is too large to put into a full laptop case, so unless you're putting it in a catalog case or a large case of that nature it is not good for traveling. I used this case for a while to carry my macbook between home and work where I had a power adapter at each location and it was fine. Aside from that it was not very useful. If you want to carry your power adapter with it you have to order a side pouch from Brenthaven directly and pay just as much in shipping for the pouch as you do for the case. The pockets on the case are only good enough to carry a few papers in, not even a pad of paper. Personally I find the ProLite I to be a much more useful case."
4,nice but so tight,"It's a nice bag. small and looks nice but it has a little problem. it's so tight and you can't put your mouse easily inside. I was surprised when I saw the pocket inside the bag is half size of it!!! I'll upload some photos to be clear for you. if you want to carry the charger, you better buy a small bag and put you charger in it."
2,Concerns about the Brenthaven Edge I Sleeve,"I just received the Brenthaven Sleeve for the Black MacBook that I just boughtfrom Amazon. I wouldn't call it a sleeve because that implies that you canslide your laptop in from the top. It is more of a zip-open luggage style case.There is also a zippered compartment inside the case, and I am concerned thatthis zipper might rub against and scratch the MacBook. It is also so snug inside,it's a struggle to get the laptop seated. I'm wondering if I was sent the right case.On the plus side, it is very well constructed, but don't think it's right for me."
2,"Didn't fit my 13"" MacBook","Although this is a high quality case, my 13"" MacBook didn't fit inside it.It wasn't just snug- it was impossible to fit the MacBook into this case. I had to return the case for a refund. Probably fits the older ibooks quite well, but definitely not the new MacBooks."
3,too shiny,"I had a Nike digital before that I liked. I will say though that having the battery changed was difficult. Most watch places wouldn't touch it. I ordered this one to ""upgrade"" since the band on my old one broke. Unfortunately, this one is very shiny. Both the silver part (expected) and the blue have a shiny finish. Not my style at all."
1,don't buy this watch if it's going to get wet,"I went through two of these watches in two weeks. Both watches stopped functioning after being immersed in water, even though the Triax Swift is supposed to be water resistant to 50 meters. I had expected better quality from Nike, but I was sorely disappointed."
3,nike womens triax digital lx watch,FACE OF WATCH WAS BULKY. SAT ON WRIST HIGH. COLOR AND FUNCTIONS WERE NICE. YET I RETURNED DUE TO SIZE.
1,Much better players for the same money,"I paid 40 dollars of this player, then paid another 40 dollars for a Sony Player 3 weeks later.The main drawback of this player is that it does not maintain the settings and position from your previous session. When playing MP3 discs this requires you to search literally for several minutes to find your previous stopping point. You must also readjust the volume setting for your previous session.While it looks good in the package, the unit is actually bigger, heavier and more of a battery hog than other units on the market."
1,Not a good discman at all,"This is a complete battery hog, as another reviewer stated. I could not believe that the battery icon was already showing 2/3rds full after only one cd..ONE. The batteries were dead within 4 cds. This player does not have a very consistent resume feature either. Sometimes it starts over from song one after I have turned the player off. The volume, even at its highest, is not very loud. Even when I turn it down to 2/3rds volume to try and save energy, it still seems to eat up the battery life quickly. I shouldn't have to sacrifice volume for battery life to begin with, but when it does little help, that really upsets me. My sony lasted ten (or more) times longer on two batteries, seriously! Not a good discman and I regret ever buying it."
2,Another bad one,"This disc player is indeed a battery hog, as others have stated. We ate batteries with this player, and the higher the volume, the faster the batters go.Unfortunately, it also died pretty early in the game--a matter of months.This item became another soldier in our large and growing dead cd player cemetery."
5,"beautiful, great price, soft and easy to put reins on","I ordered this bridle on a Sunday, and it came on Thursday(so great shipping speed), ironically it was when I was on my way to the stables that I received it. I had to adjust the size a little but I got it to fit very nicely. All the buckles are easy to slide in and out, so I got the reins on and the bit changed rather quickly. The gold beaded(metal) brow band looks AMAZING, and the buckles and keepers are gold too.I love this bridle and encourage anyone to buy it. I have never seen a better bridle for $46!(I'm including shipping) I've searched all of my tack stores. If I ever did happen to glance upon a bridle as nice or better, I'm sure the price would have been double the price of this one! I only had trouble unlatching the noseband, but that only lasted around 20 seconds. My horse seems to like it too!"
2,Broke on first use and poor warranty,I bought these binoculars for my wife for an Alaska vacation. She loved them however on the last day a large spec appeared inside the binoculars. It looked like a chunk of black paper. I returned it for repair (25 year warranty) and had to pay shipping. They said it was misaligned and charged me $10 to repair and $10 to ship it back. They never even mentioned the spec in the lense. I am still waiting on them to return them to me. I will not buy a Nikon product again because they did not stand behind their product.
4,"Sturdy and light, but not great for those with glasses","Finally had a chance to use it. I took it to a concert. The weight is very light (great!) and with it zoomed out, it functioned like normal binoculars. When zoomed in, any movement you make gets enhanced by X24. If you can brace yourself against something steady to view a zoomed in object this is great. Otherwise normal movements make the 24X feature unusable.Finally if you wear glasses you will need to continually take them off to view through the binocular. Not a big deal, just annoying. Adding image stabilization to this product would be awesome!"
2,not for me,"These didn't work for me: I sent them back. The high power zoom was pretty much useless - I would need a tripod to reduce the shake at the 20X level. The field of view (25) is also very narrow. What really decided for me was comparing them with my friend's Swift Eaglet 7x36 which cost twice as much, but ruined me for anything less. I bought the Eaglet."
3,Nikon 8-24x25 Travelite V Zoom Binoculars,"These binoculars are high grade, made well and have a great case they come with. Problem is, the higher you go, the more ""shake"" there is, to the things you're trying to see. Lower settings work very nicely, but unless you're as steady as a tripod....you will get ""shakey"" viewing."
4,Slave to the Wage,"This song is different to Placebo's music from 'Without You I'm Nothing' CD. It sounds similar to Taste in Men and it is undoubtebly a Placebo single. It is slightly repetitive in some places but its a great song by a great band. The lyrics are great and made better by Brian's voice. Overall a good song, and I'm looking forward to their new CD, Black Market Music."
1,Decidedly Below-Par,"I wasn't too thrilled when Placebo traded their raw, punky energy for the predictable indie/metal dirge designed to appeal to The Average Goth. Without You I'm Nothing had it's high points, but t'was nothing compared to their fresh, non-pretentious debut. With this single however, Placebo appear to have lost the plot entirely. Taste in Men was decidedly average, and this continues the theme with its watered down minimalist approach.These tracks sound shallow, lacking the density and power that make rock music great. Placebo sound as if they're disowning their roots to establish themselves as a unique band; but instead of creating something new and innovative, they trade their talent for a lack of melody, sloppy songwriting, and lyrics that make you cringe.While Black Market Music exceeded (low) expectations, Slave to the Wage remains one of the weakest tracks on the album, and even earlier, pointless B-side remixes were better quality than the two dire songs featured here."
2,What a Letdown!,"The beginning of this book showed a lot of promise. Calvin reminded me of people I used to know, and I even uttered some of his teen angst quips when I was his age. However, as the book went on, nothing really happened. Duncan is a talented writer and I really enjoyed the format of the book, but he kept dropping hints of things that happened (such as his younger brother's death), but he never really explained or followed up with them. I also agree with the other reviewer in that the message was ""do drugs and have a lot of sex before you get old because then no one will want you anymore."" That's unfortunately the thought of many young gay men already and it doesn't need to be perpetuated.All in all, I would hesitate to recommend buying this book, but it's not too bad of a read if it's laying around or you find it at the library."
4,Dance from a Different Drummer,"This story is based in Brisbane, Australia and if the goings-on bear any resemblance to real life there, it has to be the gayest place on earth. All the boys are constantly checking each other out. Boys on the street. Boys on the bus. Boys ostensibly with their girlfriends. Sixteen-year-olds have more sex than a fulltime porn star. But these are not complaints! The author, all of twenty-two, has an original style that blends flashbacks, fast-forwards, e-mail transmissions and it all works. My copy was printed in the U.S. so I don't know if it was ""Americanized"" but there are still some colloquialisms from down under. I figured out quickly what a ""uni"" is; it took a bit longer for a ""long black"" -- no, not what you think! There is a great amount of decadence and depravity ... and that's from the likeable characters! Alasdair Duncan is described as an ""edgy new voice."" Based on this work, indeed he is."
2,Not Another One,"Once upon a time I hated the fact that most gay books had the 'good' gay characters all dying or just suffering really bad. It was a sort of institutionalized self-loathing. Who knew I'd miss them? The story of the young gay teen with no real problems having to create them, sometimes even fatally, is a lot less fun and appears to be the new wave. If you like nihilism and pointlessness to your protagonists, this is the book for you. The only thing I liked was the clever narrative devices the author uses. Maybe he'll use them someday in a book I like."
5,Fine as a solar thermostat,"I use this thermostat inside a solar hot water collector, since it has a metal body. I removed the plastic knob and cover, and have no problems with it, unlike the previous plastic body thermostat I used, which now looks like a Salvador Dali painting."
3,Temp not even close!,"Just installed in my garage for an exhaust fan, with the knob turned up to 90, still is running the fan, it's not even 80 degrees in the garage so I think I am going to have to uninstall, or the fan will run all the time!"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money !!,"This unit has a temperature range of 5 plus degrees between turning on and shutting off. It is in the same location as a previous thermostate that did not experience this problem. Contact through Amazons complaint system produced no reply. Calls to the company are answered by a machine with a promise of a call back, great idea for those customers that are within phone range all day.Well, what a surprise. After this review was posted I received a call from Lux, with a call back number. The rep told me that these should have a range of plus or minus 2 degrees. They sent a new unit and paid for return of the original."
1,Wrong part,"Although I talked to customer service to verify what part I needed, it did not work as described. Found one at ACE Hardware."
3,Deliverability - Works to some degree,"First, Deliverability. This seller would not accept a P.O. Box shipped USPS. Why? I have no idea why! They shipped it USPS and they wouldn't accept P.O. Box. My physical address doesn't take post office deliveries. I had to track down the package through the Post Office and get it re-routed to the P.O. Box. The package was almost returned.""Having a mercury thermometer beside the unit one can tell the real temp.Second, The item does not have an accurate temperature control. It's roughly 7 to 10 off on the plus side. If you set it around 80-85 it'll read for 72-75Third, The unit sticks to the on position. If you think it's to cold and you go to the unit and give it a light tap, it'll then shut off. Defeats the purpose of having an automatic thermostat. But, It will eventually shut off by itself when it's cold.All in all, It's useful to have and it works to some degree. If you can get past the quarks that is."
1,"On concrete wall, sensor is not very accurate","I mounted this on a concrete wall (the building is cinder block)to control an air conditioner.It does not seem to sense the temperature very well.The normal temp here is about 84F. The sensor does notturn off until I set it to 90. If I set it to 80,th A/C never turns off. The AC runs continuously even thoughthe room is very cold. I'm guessing, even though theroom is cold, it is sensing the temp of the wall.I think it needs a temp sensor that you can placeaway from the wall."
2,The temperature differential is huge.,"If you set it to 75, even when it's directly in the path of airflow, mine doesn't turn on until 80 and then will keep the unit on until it gets down to 70. I'm replacing it with a programmable 24v stat, 24v transformer and a mars relay setup to get it under control. So I wasted the 17 bucks."
5,Crawl space dry room controller,I am using this LuxPro cool only thermostat to turn on a dehumidifier in my dry room. The dry room is a poly plastic walled area in the crawl space under my house. The LuxPro prevents the dehumidifier from coming on and frosting up in cold weather. So far so good.
3,It works,"Well it works. not vary accurate from my experience but that is ok.I think I got it down now, set it to 82 to have the room at 78. lol"
1,"This is an on-off switch, not a thermostat","I was really hoping this would work as promised, as there are almost no options for line voltage cooling thermostats. Unfortunately what many of the other reviews say is true. This thermostat has such poor sensitivity that it basically functions as an on-off switch that looks like a thermostat. I have not had it 'trip' due to temperature changes, either in the on or off direction, more than a couple of times in months of attempted operation. I even sent the first one back and got a replacement because I thought it was defective. Wish there was another alternative that looked decent; unfortunately most look like they are from 1970."
1,In line control.,I bought this to run my swamp cooler. The temperature differential was to extreme and would not operate as wanted. Luxpro told me there was no way to adjust this unit.
3,*,"This book raises many significant questions about teacher/student relationships. As an instructor I thoroughly enjoyed Freire's ideas (even when I didn't agree with him). Anyone who teaches could benefit from engaging Freire's ideas. At worst, you will have something new to think about."
4,Fine Tribute To A Great Song Stylist,"I CARE 4 U offers further proof that Aaliyah was one of the great song stylists of the modern R&B scene. While she never possessed a far-reaching vocal range, she always managed to get the most out of that range, expertly navigating between uptempo fare like ""Are You That Somebody?"" and ""Back And Forth"" to slow jams like ""One In A Million"" and the title track. Among the unreleased tracks, ""Don't Know What To Tell Ya"" and particularly the fabulous ""Miss You"" are first-rate. If there's one misstep here, it's the exclusion of some Aaliyah's previous bests--I can't believe ""The One I Gave My Heart To"", ""We Need A Resolution"", and especially ""Rock The Boat""(her best single ever) were left off. That aside, this remains a nice reminder that Aaliyah possessed far more style and presence than current ""it"" girls like Ashanti will ever stumble upon."
4,I Care 4 U,"Certainly, after her tragic death in a plane crash last year, Aaliyah deserved a recorded remembrance. It's just that I Care 4 U seems an odd way to show you care. Short as her career was, there were plenty of singles to choose from, but this brief greatest-hits package omits worthy choices like ""4 Page Letter"" and her last release, ""Rock The Boat,"" instead touting five unreleased tracks.This isn't Tupac we're talking about, though: it's probable that Aaliyah, only 22 when she died and with a full-scale acting career, didn't have much in the vaults. What she did leave behind sounds fine, if not earthshaking; the high school-into-college ballad ""Miss You"" is--like many of Aaliyah's best songs--gossamer R&B; that uses her girlish vocals to full advantage. The shame is that her far more interesting final appearance, on mentor Timbaland's ""I Am Music,"" isn't included here. That spooky electroballad is the poignant eulogy this collection falls short of providing."
3,Dissapointed.,"When they said some of the songs where unrealesed I wonder why? I only enjoyed 1 or 2 of the new songs and found Erica Kane a bit annoying. It really wasnt anything new or speacial, exiting or astounding since It was all one of those hits albums that a true fan has all the songs already from previous albums. I heard the cd from a friend and happy I didnt buy it. From what it Looks like the video section has a nice selection and this is what i would really buy the cd for... the DVD. I enjoyed the dvd videos and the behind the scenes. I really do love Aaliyah rest in peace... but I didnt enjoy her tribute album."
4,RIP Aaliyah,"I only bought this for one song (R U That Somebody), so I can't really review the whole CD. But that song definitely gets 5 stars from me."
2,It is [...]!,"I believe that Aaliyah was a beautiful artist, but this album is not one of her greatest works. mY only complaint is the fact that she can't do it over, cause it needs perfecting right now."
4,The Original Princess Hip-Hop and R&B,"This CD is great! And I don't think you people should be downing Aaliyah's art. These songs are what she created and you are going to hate on her? It's like you're saying that you're happy that she is dead. People always hated on Aaliyah even when she was alive and no one recognize her now. And she's a whole lot better than the new singers we have today like, Ashanti, Beyonce, and Tweet. Stop hating on the Princess Aaliyah!"
4,Good unreleased tracks,I havent bought the album yet because it isn't out in the UK yet but i've just downloaded the 6 unreleased songs and I am impressed. Im not ur average aaliyah fan I am a really big fan i think she was an amazing performer in her singing and acting roles.I think the best song is Dont Know What to Tell ya - it has a Asian/indian sounding rhythm probably Timbaland produced and sounds similar to 'we need a resolution' I wouldn't exactly say it was her best work so far but all of Aaliyah's music is worth listening to. Most of the songs are ballads and need to grow on me. I think this album should be on the shelf of every Aaliyah fan's bedroom.
5,Great!,"I thought that Aaliyah songs left with her until I researched them and found ""I Care 4 U"". I just love ""Are you that Somebody"". Aaliyah, thank you for the music. RIP"
3,Missing many key songs...,"All songs on here are worthy, but there are many missing. Where is ""Age ain't nothing but a number?"" Three singles from ""One in a Million"" are missing; ""4 Page Letter,"" ""The One I gave my heart to"" and ""If your girl only Knew."" Two singles from ""Aaliyah"" are not here; ""We need a resouloution"" and ""Rock the Boat."" Where is ""I don't wanna.""? Where is ""Come back in one peace.""? The album is good, but I wish it included more songs."
5,The Best CD Ever!,I Think Aaliyah Did a fabulous job on her new CD I Care 4 U. The new songs she had on the CD was perfect. She needed to have the songs out on her album she created them for. This was a great last album before she died. This album is here for us to never for get who Aaliyah was and what she sounded like she had a beautiful voice and i will be missed forever.
5,i care 4 u aaliyah,"I LUV this album!I purchased this CD from Wal-mart,and it ROCKS THE BOAT! The DVD included with the CD shows Aaliyah videos from ""Rock The Boat"" to ""Try Again"" to ""Are You That Somebody"". You should defianettly buy this album!"
3,not bad,"it wasn`t as good as i expected. some of the songs don`T really contribute to having aaliyah`s memory stay alive. some of the songs were boring and easily skipable. standout songs-one in a million, are you that somebody, more than a woman and try again"
3,Mediocre - Somewhat Disappointing,"Wow. One of the best R&B stars dead, and they can only manage to scrounge up a couple good songs? Don't get me wrong. Try Again, More than A Woman, and One in a Million (etc) are great songs. But, where's Rock the Boat? What about Age Ain't Nothin But A Number? If Your Girl Only Knew? Loose Rap? We Need A Resolution? Yes, the new additions are nice, but what happened to those great songs? There is still extra room on the CD. The somewhat lacking number of good songs is, however, balanced with the wonderful additions, which is why I'm giving it a 3."
2,This cd needed more work,"I thought that her record company would print a summary on her life, but they didnt. its just photographs of her and the listing of songs and videos. I like a couple of songs, but her best songs are not on the cd. I dont know why they even call it a greatest hits cd."
5,Classic!!!,"Aaliyah's latest album is off tha chain. It has some old songs and some new ones. My personal favorites like ""Back and Forth"" and ""At your best"" are on the cd, as well as some new favorites like ""Come over"" and ""Don't know what to tell ya"". All of the songs are tight, and I think she'd be proud. R.I.P. Aaliyah"
4,It Was Great,"I Care 4 U is a great collection of a few of Aaliyah's greatest hits and some new joints too. I was really expecting a cd of nothing but unreleased songs, but it's all good. Now I do have to complain about the DVD. I really wanted a DVD that had all of Baby Girl's videos. Otherwise, this release was great."
5,Aaliyah Is the Best Angel !,"Aaliyah was the best Angel that ever was the song on the album""I Care 4 U"" album is the most album that ever was on her albumI like the song ""Back and Forth"", and ""I Miss You"" R.I.PAaliyah."
5,At Her Best,"This a wonderful c.d by the late GREAT PRINCESS of R&B. To listen to this cd from start to finish took me back to when Aaliyah first came out and it helped me discover even more how talented she was with some of the tracks that I never heard before. Like the song ""Dont know what to tell ya"" is a fly song that talks about a man that is insecure. It is a good song with a nice beat. My favorite song is ""Miss You"" which is getting air and video play right now. I love this c.d. Every song is good! There's no real need to skip over a song unless you just want to get to a favorite track! This c.d, just shows more talent that the artist had. She definetly had the ability to move people. P.S the dvd is good too! Please buy this! One Love!"
3,Left Off Alot Of Her Best Songs,Where's If Your Girl Only Knew? and We Need A Resolution? This best of cd is ok but the girl had many good songs and this collection doesn't show them. I hope they put out another one because this is a shame
5,Rest in Piece my love,Aaliyah is my favorite singer i like her style no one can compare to her i even wish i was her and im a guy i love her music especially on the Aaliyah her last cd. My favorite song on the album i care 4 U is dont know what to tell ya.
2,Just enough for the casual listener,"Aaliyah's career was cut short due to a fatal plane crash in August 2001. ""I care 4 U"", released after her death is a mix of new material and old classics. The songs on this disc capture some of her most popular hits such as ""Are you that somebody"", ""One in a million"", and ""Try again"". Beyond the few hits on this disc, the remainder lack depth and creativity.If you are seeking a light R&B; experience, Aaliyah does the trick with her angelic vocals and soulful production (Missy Elliot & Timberland). However, this CD is not one of my favorites in this genre due to its repetitive nature and simply dull non-hit tracks.Overall this an average listen and nothing more. If you are a fan of Aaliyah this will make a great addition to your collection."
4,A great book for the home chef!,"There were alot of great recipes in this book. Some of them sound intimidating, but the author makes it very easy to follow and prepare. There is also a good deal of information on buying fish, meats and seafood."
1,a really crummy book,"Own and have read all previous Pronzini efforts...have always enjoyed his work...However, this trite piece of claptrap is an insult to the authors' readers, and constitutes taking money by false pretenses when it is sold to the public....a really crummy book by a previously reliable author, who should remain nameless."
3,Book for the veterans,"I bought this for my now ex-husband, he wouldn't read it, but I read most of it. It was written well and for someone who truly has PTSD."
3,Intense,I have not finished reading this book as it is very graphic and emotional. I might be worth 5 stars when I finish but I have to get away from it for a while and only read it in pieces.
2,credentials,"I agree with Mr. Sneed, with one exception. Mr. Tick's PhD is in Communications, not clinical psychology (or counseling or any other relevant phd). This might explain his naive approach to war and the healing of others. I hope his heart is in the right place, and he is not just one more charlatan cashing in on the tragedies of others. War is hell, and there is no such thing as ""the good old days."" I hope Dr. Tick will in the future focus his efforts in areas for which he has the expertise to write."
4,War is not fun,Helps those that have been there maybe understand themselves a little better and those that have not to also get a little insight into what it takes to live with going to war and combat....
3,nope.,"the person who wrote that last review indeed has read very little. naturalism has been easily refuted using nothing but logic by c.s. lewis in the book titled ""miracles"". if you have not read it, i suggest you do so before asserting anymore of your ridiculous claims. further more, you might want to pick up darwin's black box by michael behe if you are so sure about the truth of evolution. i do believe though that the ""contradiction"" between science and religion is quite a misnomer which is fueled by moranic fundementalist who insist on accepting nothing but the strictest and most literal interpretations of scripture. (in fact being a scientist myself i know of the numerous ways that science supports creation)."
1,Dissapointed in Amazon.,"For some reason Amazon could not source me a New Copy for my collection..!Very Dissapointed,as i was so looking forward to adding this book to my growing collection of Beautifull Japanese Garden and Architecture Glossy References."
4,Good book for those who know what they're doing,"I really enjoy using this as a reference book when I need to look something up about inference. Everything in the book is highlighted well and gives clear and concise answer. If you're a straight A student in Math, there should be nothing confusing about this text."
1,A story leaking like sinking boat,"Well, J.K. did it again. This one is quite beyond my recongnition! I've never read a book with so many leaking flaws. I just couldn't believe 1) how the writer made up a story with so poorly make-believed scenario? 2) How the author's editors would not find it impulsively to point out those unbelievable plots and scenes in this book? Were they blind,or just too lazy or scared to do so? Did J.K. taking any banking reserch before he wrote this book? Did he really believe a teenaged girl who has never touched a gun in her life, could shoot like a swatteam sharp shooter? Give me certain credit as a mature reader, OK? I have to get into a lifeboat before reading your novels again if I didn't find you were still salvageable in your JUST CAUSE"
3,as400,"book was too much about operating and not enough about programmingthere needs to be some operations but more on libraries and how to compile link, etc"
3,I'm not sure I trust this monitor.,"I've had a number of problems with my glucose monitor.The ten test strips that came with it seem to have been bad even though the expiration date was still good. They gave me high readings and also widely varying readings with the control solution.Abbott customer service was very responsive and when I told them about the problem they sent me 50 test strips and two more bottles of control solution at no charge. They even offered to send a replacement meter.The new test strips have given me readings within the normal range, about 10-20 points below the first batch of test strips. They also give fairly consistent readings with the control solutions (within 5%).What worries me is that I did three tests on the same finger prick within a few minutes and one of them was way off from the others.It's very easy to use and requires very little blood which I like. It seems to be accurate enough for a general reading but I don't know if I'd want to stake my life on it."
2,Highly inaccurate and confusing,"I bought this based on some reviews that it requires less blood sample and compact unit. BUT when I tried, it was HIGHLY inaccurate. As soon I received it I took 3 tests within 2 minutes to make sure it is reasonably accurate, it really scared me. Three readings are not even close to each other. I followed the instructions to feed the blood sample only on oneside of the strip and also I am aware that blood glucose levels may vary slightly even within few minutes, but this meter showed different values between 130 and 210 !!! That is a difference of being normal and diabetic. Then I checked on a healthy person which also showed significantly different readings within minutes.I agree with Thomas Huber's feedback it is dangerous too to have such varying results. I should have followed his feedback before purchasing it to save time."
1,still waiting,"I ordered more than a dozen movies from various venders and received all of them promtly and in good condition, except for ""The Ledgend of the Beverly Hillbillies"". I was charged for the movie and have paid the credit card company, but have yet to get my movie. Hope this situation is corrected soon."
3,"some 12"" gems-some 12"" errors. Steep price","Volume 1 of this 3 disc series has some great sound quality and some hard to get classics on CD, but it also has a handful of not so sought after versions too. This is the breakdown:1.

5,Great Science Fiction Curio Movie!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great science fiction curio 30's movie made when Television was in the delevelopmental stage and the thoughts they had on it at that time.It's a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A great resource book-,"This book is easy to follow, is divided up into compact but thorough chapters, and provides a great overview of a variety of techniques. A must-have for a new professional or even a seasoned therapist who would like additional material to work with."

5,Track List,"1. Hansel und Gretel Ouverture, 2. The Blue Bird, 3. The Royal Children, 4. The Sleeping Beauty."
5,Welcome Nostalgia,"I like to say that I grew up on Route 128, but it isn't true--but in 28 years of living in Rhode Island, I made many trips with my parents on Route 128 to homes of relatives living in Beverly and Peabody, originally coming up Route 1 past Jolly Cholly's amusement park in Attleboro and joining 128 at the H/Motel 128 interchange in Dedham. This book chronicles the original ""look"" of the highway rather than the interstate-overlaid road people know today, which is all the more fascinating. Anyone remember traveling past Pleasure Island Park on 128? Or the old Northshore, which wasn't an enclosed mall? Ah, youth..."
3,PLEASANT EASY LISTENING,"Rita Coolidge garnered two big hits in the 70s: the Boz Scaggs penned WE'RE ALL ALONE and her cover of YOU'RE LOVE HAS LIFTED ME HIGHER. Possessed with a good voice and emotional deliveries, LOVE LESSONS is a pleasant enough collection. Most of the tracks are predictable pop confections with the standout song being CHEROKEE, which celebrates Rita's Native American heritage. It's a lovely melodic tune and handsomely arranged.All in all enjoyable albeit nothing groundbreaking,"
5,Great manual,Completely covers the car from bumper to bumper. A must for the do-it-yourselfer who is getting started with restoring cars
4,A Thrilling Book!!!,"The Time Machine, is a thrilling book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. H.G. Wells writes about the dreams that most people have of building a real working time machine. Everyone, at some point in there life has wondered what it would be like if we could go back or forward in time. H.G. Wells makes that dream come true for us. In the book, the time traveler goes into the future and he was very disappointed with what he had seen. He saw that the people of the future were very uneducated, They had the mentality of a 4-year-old. It makes the time traveler appreciate the period of time he came from. I would recommend this book, because it shows us that no matter how much our world is struggling, we should appreciate the time we live in. God is in control and he puts us exactly were we need to be."
5,Excellent,This item was purchased for my son by his request as a gift. He is an animator and was thrilled with it.
4,"Clever, Original, and Off-beat","""Foster's"" is one of Cartoon Network's best original creations, and certainly among the best in recent years. The art and animation are very stylish and eye-catching, and the characters are all uniquely loveable in their own humorous, idiosyncratic ways.If you haven't seen this show, you should definitely check it out, as there is plenty of humor for kids and adults alike."
5,More season sets PLEASE,"Hey Mr. Warner can you put up the complete third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons on DVD please? Fans would really be really pleased to see the show on DVD."
5,Gotta love this one!,"This movie has the perfect incline for a thriller movie. For the first part of the movie, you don't remember it's a horror/thriller. Then for the rest, it's just a thrill ride. A lot of people don't like this movie because it wasn't low budget and had some weird moments that the movie could have done without, but all in all, great movie. I don't use this word, but for the movie, it holds true: spooky."
1,Leaves Viewers in a Dark Place,"I am a fan of most ""Turn of the Screw,"" related works. I am normally a fan of Leelee Sobieski's movies. Not so this time.The movie was a sad, depressing jaunt through the horrors of men. There wasn't a single male figure that was a remotely positive individual throughout the run of the film, including the little boy she was supposed to be caring for. You can sum up all male roles in one word: abusive. The women were victimized, and the children fared little better. Unfortunately, the characters had precious little depth or plausibility.The movie was incredibly slow. It was dark, but senselessly so. There is also the sense that the main character is quite mad, completely unsuitable for work as a governess. The best thing about the film was the setting."
3,Wanted to like it..,I really wanted to like this movie it had potential but it just fell flat... nothing else to add lol it's a disappointing flick.
1,AWFUL!!,"Augh! I popped over to see what kind of reviews this terrible movie got, and am in complete shock that anyone would say this was a good movie. I rented it because the cover sparked my curiosity. I watched the whole thing from start to end, thinking maybe in its final moments it might suprise me. Didn't happen. The whole movie is so slow moving. And to make a slow movie go even slower, we have to watch the main character doing everyday things like bathing, walking the grounds, walking down halls, etc. None of which added any meaning to the plot. I figured out what was really going on early in the film, but like I wrote previously, thought the end might suprise me. In my opinion, the production of this movie was a total waste of everything--- space, money, time, plastic, ink, etc."
1,What??,"In a weekend of watching little known thrillers and ghost stories, we thought this one would be the most suspenseful and well made. Ah, how disappointed we are now. Although the lead actor is a stunning beauty, what the hell was she doing and where was the plot? The film moves too slowly and for the most part was poorly acted. The only believable character was Mr. Laine and he was on the screen for 20 seconds. The sexual undertones (overtones?) did not add the edginess that was required and ended up just being disturbing for disturbing's sake. If empathy was the intent in the abuse references, this movie really missed the mark in a very unsettling way."
1,Leelee can't save this dreadful movie!,"While Leelee is certainly a talent that can make or break a movie, I don't think anything would save this lame adaptation of Henry's Turn of the Screw. I have lost all interest in seeing the original starring Deborah Kerr. It was that bad! The story dragged and never captured me despite such a beautiful young actress. She is a treasure, but this one needs to be buried deep...very deep."
1,A mess...,"This was an embarrassing, slow moving mess. Leelee plays an extremely awkward and possibly extremely disturbed art teacher who becomes a governess. Too many scenes are devoted to her wandering around outside, sitting in the bath, staring ahead blankly, and creeping around the house. Also creepy was her tendency to creep around in a low-cut bathrobe -she was so awkward that it was uncomfortable and you felt sorry for her. The nude butt scene comes out of nowhere and makes you go ""what...?""Even more uncomfortable, unnecessary, and TACKY was the violin masturbation scene with her female employer.At the end, nothing is explained, and that is likely the ONLY reason you didn't eject this disk mid-viewing was to see if the spirits were real, the children were evil, or if she and the kids were just messed up and crazy to begin with.I watched another horrible movie afterwards that made this one look better, but it's still not something I recommend wasting time on."
3,Not as bad as most reviews say,"It is weird as to why they would hire someone to look after the kids when Ms. Grose is there 24/7. Honestly I will not knock on Leelee's performance because the script itself is questionable more than the actress'.I did not expect Ms. Grose to be a lesbian it was a twist. Also since when do people complain about a girls showing too much of nothing? Leelee wore some skintastic outfits which revealed her lovely body, however she still remained covered which should satisfy both type of audiences.The description made the movie seem more interesting than what it really was. I stil enjoyed it, Leelee's performance wasn't all that great to carry the film, but her looks did it for me. She tried the best she could considering the script she had."
3,A quick comment,"A previous reviewer wrote:""I was also bothered by Sobieski's persistent near nudity""....hmmm..I thought the movie was quite interesting, and I cannot imagine ever saying something like this.Thanks"
1,LAME!,"I LOVE Leelee, I think she's great, this film however was a stinker. I was hoping for a good scare, but all I got was confused. Although well acted, the story was boring and weird"
5,Perfect for when you have egg on your face,"Embarrassing, whimsical, and cringe-worthy, this soundtrack recounts all of the great Larry David moments. Who can help but laugh out loud when they hear the dreaded music that accompanies an angry Susie Green? Any Curb Your Enthusiasm fan will appreciate hearing this selection of songs."
4,Curb Your Enthusiasm Music from the TV Series,With enough proding HBO released this collection of fun music. It has a quality which will last and enjoyed by many fans.
1,"Doesn't Play, DVD player cannot read disk","Doesn't play / DVD player cannot read disk. Looks like ""aftermarket"" do-it-yourself CD recording. DON'T BOTHER BUYING IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Interesting old movie,"This movie was interesting as a glimpse of Clark Gable's career and because of several other good actors. The story is about a spy in Russia who gets caught, but has an unlikely helper in the father of a rabble-rousing girl who is involved in governmental overthrow, and her dad want's the spy to get her out of the country. It has a few good twists, and is worth watching at least once, but the story doesn't have a wonderful plot, and is not one of the ""greats"" from movie history."
5,Five stars for sheer entertainment value,"Aside from the fact that it rather glosses over some key films (Woody Allen's output almost altogether - a curious ommision in light of the fact that he proclaims Allen to be one of the few genuine auteurs of the period, and has Coppola saying as much in the conclusion) this is a great anecdotal history. Great stories culled from an impressive list of author interviews. It's a shame that he lets his disdain for the consequences of Star Wars and Jaws for the movie industry sully his opinions of those fabulous films. Infact, the one let down in the book is his resentful attitude to those two film makers."
1,Raging bulls easy riders,"This has to be the worst book I have read in years, do not beleive the cover reviewers as they have clearly not read the whole book."
1,"Not Recieved, No Refund","They say they sent it to my address, but i never recieved it. I called them. they told me they sent it, and did not offer further help."
4,More Myths of the Flower Children,"In stereotypical ""I am an art movie elitist"" fashion, Biskand subscribes to the silly notion that Spielberg and Lucas were the poison apples in the 70s cinematic Garden of Eden. Too bad he failed to notice that at exactly the same time the exact same thing was happening throughout the rest of the entertainment industry. Ever heard of an album called Frampton Comes Alive? The fact that the movie ""business"" has deteriorated into its current state has more to do with changes in the way movies are financed, marketed, and distributed than Bogdanovich, Coppola, et al. ""blowing it"".This book made for a fascinating read, but I'm so tired of the premise that The Godfather is vastly superior to Star Wars because of its deeper meaning and tragic ending. Get over your romanticism with gangsters and see it for what it really was, a pretty faithful adaptation of a best selling novel with great casting and cinematography."
1,A real hatchet job and an ugly book...,"While this book details the lives and careers of some of the hottest Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s it does so with a very sharp hatchet. Basically, to sum up Biskind's book, all of these directors--Scorsese, Friedkin, Coppola, Altman, Lucas--are ugly people who only made good films accidentally, fearing they would be fired the whole time they made them. This book is completely shameless and absolutely embarassing to read. It is a disgrace to everyone it purports to tell the story of. Biskind picks the most crash-and-burn directors and really goes to work."
1,"Awful, painful to read","This was probably the most pretentious pile of garbage I've ever had to read. Ignoring the movie titles them selves, this book read like a cheap check-out counter tabloid. It's obviously written by a die-hard hollywood fan, but not from a historical point of view. Oh no, it was written by someone desperately fawning over the in-crowd, wishing *so hard* that people were talking about *them*. If this book were a person, it would be found standing in a group of film students all trying to one up each other, just pining for the opportunity to say ""Oh you don't know about so-and-so? pff."" before turning its nose up and continuing on its self-indulgent soapbox.By the end of the second chapter I had taken to just reading the first line of each paragraph and managed to get the entire gist of the book. Each paragraph is filled with so much gossipy fluff, you'd think it was being written by a student trying to hit the minimum word count for an English assignment."
5,highly entertaining and fun,"I read lots of entertainment books and this was the best since goldman's adventures in the screen trade. for everyone who loved the classic movies of the 70's and are familiar with all the directors who came of age then, you'll love this book. A lot of fun and highly recommended."
2,be careful,"beware of taking this book's anecdotes and details too literally. i know a few of the people biskind discusses in the book, and they all say he gets many things flat-out wrong. my take on the book is: he's generally right (sex, drugs, ego), he's gratuitously nasty (ok, they were all egomaniac jerks, but they did make some good movies), and he could have used a good fact-checker."
4,Great book for VB .NET game programming,I have the C# version of this book and wanted to get into VB .NET. This book is clear and concise. I especially liked the Managed DirectX9 introduction. Very cool!
1,Samuel Barber: Choral Music,"I was delighted to find this recording of many of Barber's choral works. I was not so delignted to listen to it. The sound quality was extremely poor - don't know when I have heard a classical recording with such poor sound. I was expecially looking forward to the Agnus Dei, but it was with extreme disappointment."
5,Pokemon Rules!!!,"Anyone who says Pokemon suchs must be crazy! No affence! Now I like Yu-Gi-Oh OK, but compared to Pokemon, It stinks! No affence, I love it to (but not as much!) I love the episode 'Hole Lotta Trouble', because May gets cought with Jessie, Ash with James, and Max, Brock,Meowth, and Pickachu! This DVD is real funny! I LOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEWobbuffet! (He's my favorite!!!)"
1,its time to duel yugioh way better then pokemon,ok this show sucks its ben on ever since i was 5 or was it 4 i cant remember but now im 11 eew this show is gross im like ashes age man this show goes on and on and never stops its so old and boring without liitle kids watching this show it wouldnt even be on and when ever they make a movie it will go straight to video so that means it doesnt do that great put when ever i see lil kids play pokemon cards i roll my eyes this show s...s...s...SUCKS! and thats that.
5,Very high quality.,"Beautiful and very high quality. Very long cord included, I had to disassemble to shorten it as the mantel plug is very close. The unit casts light perfectly. A high-end product that is worth the price."
2,Pretty bad..,"I hate to disagree with the formidable reviewers before me, but I thought Mother Tongue was a disappointment. First of all, I was interested in the odd quirk of a linguist studying dialect and would have actually liked more details on this. The title suggested the ""language"" issue would be discussed, however, it really wasn't developed much more than as a plot device. This book was one of those mysteries that just keeps introducing more and more characters (and potential suspects) which confuses the plot terribly - even in the later chapters new characters appeared. I didn't find the immigrant isses as compelling as they may have been and were (in some ways) tangential to the story. Perhaps the book may be a fair ""local color""-Southern-small-town story, etc. but it failed as a tightly written mystery."
4,pollita chiquita,"Excellent Spanish version of Henny Penny. All the animals think the sky is falling. Accompanying illustrations are adorable! Great book for preschoolers learning Spanish. Rhyming names of animals are fun and easy to remember, Pavo Bravo, Gansa Mansa, etc. My children love it!"
3,Stairway to Heaven,"I was expecting a full-length CD with 7 or 8 songs, at least. There are two versions of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" done well, but one live and one studio. There is one other song, but that's it! Not my best purchase."
1,Displeased with this product,"I returned this book because I found the quilt patterns to be very ordinary and boring -- nothing new or unique. Also, the recipes were exceptionally complex -- much too involved and time-consuming. I thought that the author, being a quilter herself, would include easy recipes in consideration of other quilters who would rather spend time on their hobby."
5,Wish it were still in print,Over the years I have made every recipe in this book. This book is like a trusted old friend. There is nothing in the book that isn't good. I still have the Nepalese Vegetable Curry once a week. It is often requested when there is a get together. I recently purchased a used copy. My original one is stained with pages falling out. Buy one if you find it.
5,Excellent,This is an excellent source of information done in a way that enables understanding for a beginner student of the Bible.
3,Good for Listening Basics,"Initially I was disappointed when I realized how small the book was, but I discovered that this book contained a lot of good nuggets of help for acquiring basic listening skills. This actually would be a great gift book for educators and people in religious work who want to learn how to connect better with others. One tragic reality of 21st century life is that we fail to learn how to get outside ourselves and connect with others. Good listening skills is an essential step toward learning how to communicate to others that they matter."
4,good little book,Very sincere and clear view on a humanistic approach to listening. Author seems to practicwe what he preaches and this book should be helpful to people looking to be more empathetic with others. Only downside is over generalization of peoples problems which may require more care than flippant analysis.
2,Flakey Hub,"This is a mediocre hub. From time to time it loses connection with all plugged-in devices. Re-establishing connection requires unplugging either or both the hub's own USB-to-PC cord or the hub's power supply cord. I own two of these, and the behavior is the same on both and across three different computers (a Windows 7 x64 desktop, a Windows XP laptop, and a Mac Pro desktop).I recently replaced one of these hubs with another brand."
3,outdated software,"The statistical methods given in this book are certainly still valid. But the author should seriously consider producing a new edition of her book. Published in 1991, it used the then current version of Macsyma. That is a long epoch in software. Macsyma has been upgraded several times since.To be sure, the upgrades tend to form a superset. So if you get a recent copy of the code, then the book's advice should still mostly be germane.But undoubtedly, the upgrades have involved expanded statistical capabilities, and improved graphics. It would thus be nice to use a book that adequately reflected this, to enhance your productivity."
2,Nothing to do with statisticians,The content of this book is alomst nothing to do with the statisticians. It introduces the usage of elementary commands of macsyma. Disappointed... It might be useful only to beginners.
3,No user manual?!,"Just received mine today via 2-day shipping. The watch package is very nice. However, there is no user manual included. The watch has a lot of functions so without manual it is almost impossible to figure out how to use it. I may have to return this watch to Amazon."
1,100m water resistence,"I called customer service to ask if the seal is covered under the warranty. After talking with the warranty department, the man I talkedwith said he was assured that the seal was covered under warranty. I askedhim to e-mail me this specific assurance. He said I should get it directly from the warranty department and he gave me their phone number.I called this number and was told flatly that there was nowarranty coverage for the seal. This says the watch purchase should berated a zero but Amazon doesn't allow that option."
4,Nice bit of booty shakin Jungle,I'm no expert on the drum and bass/jungle genres but I know what I like and I like this. If you've listened to anything by DJ DB or DJ Deiselboy (one of my favs) you probably would've heard some Decoder. Nice bouncy bump and grind jungle that doesn't get boring. Some great grooves here. Kinda like Ed Rush and Optical but where I find their stuff can get repetitive Decoder keeps it shifting making it interesting enough to listen over and over.Great bass lines (or bass noises as they may be!) with a sense of humour and just some of the most kickin beats. The kind that make you dance like an idiot when you hear them in the clubs. But boy is it fun!I'd give it 4.5 stars. I keep five stars for the stuff I fall in love with.
4,"If you don't own this, you need to be BANNED FROM THE PLANET","I was lucky enough to buy the last copy of this on vinyl from Amazon. I had already known about the group since '94, but when I saw the vinyl here for sale, I had to have it despite having the cassette and cd.I think the group knew what they were doing when they made this. It's an album of half rap/half dance songs. I don't care for the dance tracks, but the songs like: ""Cockdiesel"", ""T*tty City"", & the title track are gold. It's crude, but hilarious. My friends and I still quote it after almost 20 years.I don't know what happened to these guys, but they should be proud of this record. It's entertaining as hell.The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because a few songs are dance songs, and I don't care for them at all."
3,Spinning the disc,The female masturbation track -> Dubit is actually quite good -The remainder is gang bang in the house post pubescent riff - some of it is amusing and some just doesn't work - they should have kept working on it though (on to something)
5,The Big Bad Boys At The Top Of Their Game,"I first discovered Big Bad Voodoo Daddy after their appearance in the Vince Vaughn movie ""Swingers"" and have never looked back. These guys are the real deal. If you like swing music these guys can just flat out bring it.This is the same performance that appeared on DirecTV a few months back, with a few added tracks. BBVD always put out good records, but this show captured here on CD and DVD let you know there was no studio trickery involved in their sound on the studio albums.Bottom line is you'll probably never see a finer live band, high energy, good music and great musicians. Don't wait, buy it!! It's a bargain price for a CD and a DVD!"
4,Live at the Majestic Ventura,BBVD is one of the guilty pleasures of the techno age: a throwback swing band that knows how to rock. This set captured on two handheld camaras gives the viewer an in your face experience that is miles ahead of much that is out there today. Headed by Scotty Morris the band performs 17 selections in a lightning quick seventy minutes and leaves the audience craving more. The set includes all the hits from the CD's and some surprising new twists. If you're a fan of swing this is definitely a show that you should check out. As the band puts it Go-Daddyo.
4,Fast paced with humor - couldn't put it down.,The story moves quickly and holds one's interest. I have read other works by this author and have yet to be disappointed.
4,Good work,Scottoline's legal novels are easy to read and interesting in nature. This book has an interesting twist in the end but it comes from nowhere and it seems like she was in a hurry to finsih the book.
2,Yellowed Pages,"Pages Of ""Legal Tender"" were received yellowed. I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It was not in good shape."
3,A Passable Thriller,"I must begin by saying that I actually listened to this in an abridged audio version. Perhaps the abridgement affected my view of the plotting and writing style - always a possibility.Otherwise, this novel is most of the things that other reviewers have listed. It is fast-paced. There are lots of chases. There is the typical (though not particularly believeable) love relationship that develops in the midst of the bru-ha-ha. And of course the vivid descriptions of what outfit the heroine is wearing.I liked it. It wasn't a waste of time. It also wasn't a great work of literary significance. It was exactly what escapist fiction is supposed to be - an escape. Sure there are some areas that are a little far-fetched, but does everything we read need to be absolutely realistic?Overall, it's not a terrible way to spend an afternoon or evening. Read it and enjoy Bennie Risotto's troubles. At least you know her troubles will be over by the time you reach the last page."
3,Not Crazy About This One...,"Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars. The four categories are: character development (are the characters deep and complex, plot (is it interesting), voice (is the narration smooth and engaging) and cliche level (is it predictable.)Character development: 4 stars-- Her protoganist was solidPlot: 3 stars-- I don't know--some of it seemed unlikely, some of it seemed predictableVoice: 4 stars-- It was okay--but I tired of the narrator asking the reader questions and dropping plot summariesCliche level: 3 stars-- The angry jealous woman lawyer who was jilted by the evil guy...not for me."
5,"excellent, fast-paced legal thriller","I picked up this book right before a flight to Orlando and I couldn't put it down. Although her style is often compared with Gresham, she is better. She starts off with a bang, grabs your attention and you're off and running full steam ahead. The characters are well written and fully developed. When I returned from my trip, I immediately found all of her other books because I couldn't wait to read more. Try Scottoline, you'll agree with me, she's great!"
5,A Rich Believable Story,"In attorney Bennie Rosato we have a strong woman who is able to keep pace with the likes of Kay Scarpetta (great character who is Patricia Cornwell's best creation yet one we are seeing with decreasing visibility as the author tries to develop a new set of characters that just don't measure up to Kay), V.I Warshawski (a great character whom author Sarah Paretsky seems to have abandoned to strange stylistic experimentation), and of course, Kinsey Milhone, the A-N (so far) series by writer Sue Grafton.Rosato is a tough attorney with values, a point of view, and a wonderful sense of determination. Loved it. Leave some of your other characters behind and write more about Bennie!She's wonderfully engaging."
5,Another winner from Lisa Scottoline!,"This book is one wild ride--funny, suspenseful, and at times very moving. Bennie Rosato, the heroine, gives new meaning to the word ""resourceful"". You'll feel as if you are on the wild ride with her.Be sure to read Lisa Scottoline's other novels, ""Everywhere That Mary Went"", ""Final Appeal"", ""Running from the Law"", and ""Rough Justice""."
5,Crafty counselor corrals killers,"Bennie Rosato is a thinking machine and never loses hope, even in the bleakest of situations. Lisa Scottoline is in constant warp speed, setting up both the problem and the solution for Rosato. Do I sense a bit of the real lawyer wishing that she could lead the adventurous life of the 'novel' lawyer? (Or perhaps she HAS!)This is a page turner that kept me coming back for more, and I was sorry when the bad guys, er, gals, were brought to justice. One thing that bothered me; why are all the males so dopey while the females are wizards, the men so wimpy and the women so dedicated and achieving? And some of the brief appearances of people who in fact carried a fairly responsible role, was disappointing. Question: will I look for Scottoline's books again? Answer: In a New York minute, or even in a Philadelphia nanosecond. Cheer"
4,A celebration in feminism --- hope for big city career woman,A page turner as I follow the footsteps of Bennie as she handles the prospect of being suspected of multiple murders. Clever plot of crooked lawyers abusing the process and killing to cover up the past. Well worth a read.
2,Attorney hides from law as she tries to prove her innocence.,"The main thing I want to post about this book, is the fact that the heroine is feeding a stray cat Snickers bars and Coke. Chocolate is toxic to dogs and to cats and authors should not print this type of potentially harmful information just to be 'cute.' I have written Lisa to get her comments, but she has yet to respond. Anyone else out there who loves animals and dislikes irresponsible authors?Overall, my opinion of the book was fair. I found it silly and not really suspenseful."
2,ok led lite,"this one is not that bad if the price is right , I wont pay more then $40 dollars for this."
2,Nothing but problems,"This computer hasn't worked right from the beginning. When it worked, it was great, and for that reason, I give it a 2. I've restored the system three times and now gateway tells me I need a new hard drive, and that I should have it in two business days. I ordered it over a week ago, and it's still not here. I called gateway to complain, and nothing but a run-around. After more than two hours of phone time, they finally confirmed that it was in stock, but couldn't commit to send it to me overnight. So it ""should"" show up next week.Tech support has been very polite and friendly, but couldn't provide me with the information I needed, gave me conflicting reports and finally couldn't meet a reasonable request that they send the item via overnight delivery.I understand that defects make it out of the factory. But Gateway failed to step up and make an unsatisfied customer happy. I won't buy gateway again."
5,I love it.,It came in and it all works. We just tested it and had no problems with it. Loved this one and had tons of fun watching it.
5,SHAME on you SONY DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The 5 stars are for the show, which is one of my favorites, but 0 stars for the packaging.Cheap, cheap, cheap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Really expect more from a Sony purchase, i expect the quality that shows like Bewitched get!This packaging is a new one on me, they are all stacked on a spindle, like how cd-rs and dvds are sold in bulk.Maybe they think people want to make their own covers, or lift up the whole stack to get to one at the bottom each time , but not me, they can keep it, my set arrived and was shipped back the same day!The double slimline cases( that they should have used, and like they use for other series) cost me as a consumer about .20 cents each, i imagine buying them in bulk makes them cheaper for a company like Sony, so if they are in such a need for money, charge a couple bucks extra and do it RIGHT."
4,"Sanford and Son-great show, buy a cd holder","This is a great show and the series includes plenty of episodes to enjoy for quite a while. However, as usual with these slim packaging sets, be prepared to buy a cd case to hold the discs, as the packaging it comes with is horrendous. This is largely what makes it so cheap, so I guess buying a case isn't so bad, but be prepared to have some scratched discs if you decide to only use the original packaging."
3,REMASTERED IN HIGH DEFINITON ?????,THE BOX ON THE BACK SAYS THESE WERE REMASTERED IN HD .THE ORIGINAL SEPERATE VOLUMES 1-6 DO NOT LIST THIS FACT . i READ ONE REVIEW THAT THESE ARE THE SAME DISCS FROM THE ORIGINALS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO THEM JUST A SMALL BOX . ANYONE HAVING ANY IDEA IF THERE IS A PICTURE QUALITY DIFFERNCE . THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IF THERE REALLY REMASTERED BETTER THEN THE SEPERATE VOLUMES .
2,Five stars for the show...but one star DVD release,"Like I said this is a five star show. The DVD package is poor and the show IS NOT IN BROADCAST ORDER. I am only on the third season and so far every episode is there, but like I said it is NOT in broadcast order. If you love Sanford and Son like I do you have no choice but to buy this, but be educated about your purchase. DVD's were bought new and skip and FREEZE up due to duel layering. This is our only choice to own...so I bought it."
4,Another Classic Show... Gets No Respect!!,"Sanford & Son is a classic show and continues to bring joy laughter to people everywhere. It is a T.V. Gem and deserves to be treated as such. However this classic, really got the short end of the stick, by all the Corporate Greed. It makes me sick and it is an insult to the show and a Giant slap in the face to the fans and all who worked on the show.The shows themselves are great and the four stars are only for the content.The remastering is shotty at best and the show themselves ""Are Not In the Correct Order!""...in which they originally aired.Missing, is a booklet or an episode description for each episode.The idea of having the packaging more compact is good, but don't sacrifice quality.It would have also been nice if there were some commentaries, interviews or some behind the scenes extras.Some shows get No Respect!!"
5,Well worth the money,I've seen most of the episodes of this series when it came out in the 1970's.It is simply one of the most hilarious comedies of all time.The well written scripts and acting overall are simply the best.Many of the characters in the show are peronsal friends of Redd Foxx.The acting is so good it just seems natural and you don't even think of it as a show.
4,GREAT SHOW!,This show is a GREAT show. Only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the packaging. I did not like the fact that all 17discs were place on a spindle. That way i would have to dig for the disc i want to watch. Other then that this product is GREAT. Kept me laughing nonstop.
4,Great stuff,If you liked sanford and son you'll love the dvd set..only one thing i didn't like and thats the the way dvd's are stored
4,Great service on Sanford and Son purchase,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife and I could not have been more pleased. It came on time and was very reasonably priced. The videos are great, we sat around on Christmas day and enjoyed quite a few laughs. We are big fans of Red Foxx. My wife commented on how ""it was a very thoughtful gift"" because it is her favorite. I buy all of my music from Amazon and now videos, Thanks again Amazon.Sanford and Son: The Complete Series (Slim Packaging)"
4,SAS (Sanford and Son),"As much as I enjoy watching the show, the packaging of the DVDs themselves are difficult to go through. They're in one big stack, which makes it hard to pull out the disk one wants to watch. I have that same problem with Good Times."
5,Fred Sanford Beginning to End,Enjoyed watching the years go by season after season as the set and people changed.
3,SANFORD AND SON: THE COMPLETE SERIES(SLIM PACKAGING),"ONE SIDED DVD'S BUT NO PLAY ALLI FIND THE LACK OF ""PLAY ALL""VERY SAD."
1,SONY YOU SUCK.!....,".....A major studio packages a great series like a POS.!..Im disgusted with this rip off company..cooking the books, ripping off royalties..if it say's SONY..spit on it & walk away.!..5 stars for material..zippo for SONYBOLOGNA.!"
2,Let's Not Get Carried Away,"This show's hallmark was inconsistency. It could at times offer the dreariest, most obvious cringe-inducing ""humor"" imaginable, and at other times it could provoke BIG laughs. Like the time Lamont was rehearsing his part as Othello in the Sanford living room with the lady who was playing Desdemona. Fred is unaware of any of this and all he sees as he's coming home and looks in the window is LaMont strangling a white woman. Talk about the big one! Fred freaks out and hilarity ensues. But these gems were all too rare amongst the dreck. This show ""coulda been a contendah"" if it were more consistently well-written."
1,sanford and son,i hate the way they sent this to me all 17 discs stacked together without individual cases
5,Postcard Confessions,"This book is sensational, I always check out the website and for someone to come up with something like this is amazing. The author has helped people in more ways than anyone could possibly understand, everyday people can relate to each other & realise that they're not alone in the world and that life is really worth living and changes can be made to enjoy it, even without the help of someone near by. I recommend it to anyone & everyone."
5,Great Coffee Table Book,"Makes a great coffee table book. I love all these books, you never know what the next page is going to say!"
5,secrets,"Frank Warren's book PostSecret is a collection of postcards he has received in response to a project he was doing. He handed out postcards (and left them at bookstores and other such places) and asked that people write down a secret they have but have never shared with anyone else and drop it into the mailbox anonymously. The collection in the book is amazing, they really do hit on every emotion from funny to sad. They make the reader feel more human in the sense that it makes you realize that people are more alike than we think and there are people out there that can relate to you. This is definitely a must read book! Everyone should own a copy. Kudos to Frank Warren on a terrific project."
4,"Beautiful and thought provoking, but don't get caught up","First off all I would just like to say, I love this book. I love Frank Warren and everything he has done.Inside this book you will find the deepest secrets of strangers just like you, and if your lucky you might even find yourself in this book. The only reason I gave it four stars if because I feel like...people get much to caught up in reading postsecrets and often think those secrets are about them. For me, the first time I read it I felt so...Weighted down by all the secrets...Carrying them around for weeks and feeling deppressed even if they weren't my secrets to be deppressed about. So, I only advise you to read this if you have a good sense of Judgement and can tell the difference between reality and not reality. Take Caution, and enjoy it. It might just save your life <3"
5,Incredible,"Every once in a while you run across a book thats so truthful you cry. This is one of those books. Sheer sincerity radiates off of every page of this incredible piece. I can only say that this book should be a must have and be read often, with others."
4,Voyeuristic & Relatable,"My review title says it all. One of the main things that drew me to PostSecret is that it is that glimpse into other people's lives, minds and thought processes that all human begins LOVE to get. Let's face it, we all like to hear the dirt on someone else - even if it's someone we don't know. This book is just that.Also, everyone who reads this book will tell you that at some point they came upon one (or a few) of the secrets that they could relate to. All of a sudden, you find something funny, touching, scary or disgusting and you say to yourself: ""wow - that's just like me!"" Then you feel a little less alone in the world. :-)Finally, many of these secrets have been presented in really uniquely artistic ways. Check it out, the illustrations and designs are as compelling as the secrets themselves.Definitely something that'll stay on my coffee table for a really long time. An excellent gift."
2,I love PostSecret but.....,"I love PostSecret and I love what Frank has done with the project. In a world where people are hated and looked down upon for being different, the website makes you realize that there's others out there just like you. With the same secrets as you. You feel connected to others.With that said, I think Frank could have done a better job with his first book. I opened it thinking it was going to be full of secrets I haven't seen before but instead it was secrets that had already been posted on the site. 95% of them were repeats for me. For Frank to take something that I already saw for free and try to charge me to read them again I thought was a rip off. I'm glad I read it while sitting in a big comfy chair at Barnes and Noble. Don't buy the book but I urge others to keep visiting the website."
5,My New Favorite Book,"READ THIS BOOK! It will touch you in some way.If you have a secret that is eating you inside.. send it, tell it, sell it.. do whatever you have to do to let it go.That's exactly what the people who posted cards did in this book. Some were funny, some revealing, painful, and too close to home. This is an excellent quick read.. and a definite ice breaker as a ""coffee table book."" Everyone who comes to my home picks it up and has to read the entire thing."
4,Those confessions are pretty extraordinary,"This was a gift for a friend of mine. She loves it. I looked thru it and let me tell you, those confessions are pretty juicy. Some are sad and some are like, woah dude, how could you? A few confessions are funny. Most have to do with love. Its pretty entertaining. A great bathroom book."
3,Good book up set up wrong,My only complaint with this book is that some of the postcards were blown up to fill 2 pages in the book and it was a little hard to read those postcards because the words would be accross the spine and you had to bend the book open to read all the words. I think it would have been better to leave the postcards in their original size.
4,"Good, but could be better","I've always loved the PostSecret website in a morbid, voyeuristic way. Digging into other people's lives, and often times in such a poetic fashion, is the nicest of guilty pleasures.And while all of the above is present in the book, the presentation is lacking. The pages aren't glossy, which I would have preferred, and oftentimes the postcards are arranged thoughtlessly - a single postcard can be stretched across two pages, with the center writing being lost between the book's crease.Also, having been a frequent fan of the website, I noticed that certain postcards that I absolutely loved were not included in the book, which was disappointing considering the size and cost. But still, owning these personal pieces of art is worth it for all of the small complaints."
5,Amazing Read,"Any absolutely amazing collection of people's inner thoughts and secrets, each submitted to the author on a post card. A great idea, and a great read. This book really makes you stop and think about the secrets in your own life, as well as wonder what inner secrets those around you have and never share."
4,Thought provoking...,"Interesting book that touches your heart and grips you with some select ""secrets."" Amazing concept! This is a book you will want to share with others. I like that Frank Warren invites you to participate in a future book. I will certainly send in a postcard."
3,Huge fan of postsecret.com but it didn't quite measure up,I was disappointed. This is the first of the books I've actually gotten and I plan on getting the other ones. I hope they will be better. It was ok and I'm sure it will be a great conversation piece though.
3,Kind of Disturbing,"I thought this would be a fun and quick read. And it was, I just wasn't expecting it to be so disturbing. Some of these poor people!"
1,Why pay for what you can get for free?,The book is exactly what you see on the website every Sunday. I bought it because I was incredibly into the site for some time but now I feel like it was kind of a waste of $25. The secrets are touching and moving but reading the same set over and over just isn't appealing.. You might as well just donate the money to Frank directly.
4,Interesting Perspectives,I really enjoyed reading the secrets and the art work that accompanied them.
4,post-secret,"If you like visiting the website, or have never even seen it before, this book is a perfect compliment to the hard work frank warren has done. The postcards are amazing and the book is eye-opening to a lot of different situations, both the same and different from your own."
4,Entertaining and thought-provoking,"I received this book as a gift and read it that night, in one sitting. I just couldn't stop sifting through the secrets on each page. So many were funny, disturbing, or heart-wrenching. And I could relate to so many of them.The artwork on the postcards ranges from quick sketches to gorgeous collage but, with every piece of art so personal, it's easy to get caught up in each image. The only complaint I have is with the two-page spreads. When the text runs over two pages, the binding can make it hard to read. I wish everything had been printed in its original size or on a single page.This is a beautiful book, full of so much of the human experience. It made me wonder what my secrets would be."
4,A Great Coffee Table Book,"A great idea .. great for a conversation piece.Prompted me to mail in my own secret moments after reading it.If you appreciate the creativity of others, you'll appreciate this book."
5,A heartbreaker that will make you smile,"This moving book, a compilation of never-before-revealed secrets written on one side of a postcard and sent anonymously to the website PostSecret, will touch you. Some secrets are dark, some so personal you feel an intruder for reading them, some caustic, some comical. The artwork that accompanies each message is remarkable: shocking in its originality and its effect. I had been a fan of the site and wondered if owning the book were really necessary. Would it turn into a Coffee Table Book (ugh)? The answer is no. In the same way that holding something you read is more satisfying than looking at it on screen, this book delivers. I read it the minute it arrived and I continue to be drawn back to it. I open it randomly, and am moved all over again by a stranger's baring of the soul.It is a powerful piece. Buy it for yourself. And then buy it as a gift."
3,Just a so-so book,I have been reading the Postsecret site for months now. I was so excited when I saw there was a book coming out.I was a bit dissappointed because I didn't think there were a lot of new Postsecrets included in the book.But a lot of the post secrets still make me cry.It's still a pretty good book over all though.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book for a friend and I thought it was going to be a more 'organized book' with letters but its just random notes, chicken scratch postcards and drawings that are weird. I'm sure she's going to keep this one as a ""bathroom reader""."
4,Totally engrossing,"I bought this as a gift for my twenty-something brother. I started to glance through it a little before wrapping it, and ended up sitting with my nose in it for an hour. Really cool coffee-table book."
4,"Made me want to laugh, cry and throw up","I never got to see the PostSecret art exhibition or any of the postcards on the website's original incarnation so it was nice to be able to get this book. The combination of people's raw secrets coupled with the evocative imagery on their postcards makes this a heart-and gut-wrenching book. While I was flipping through it I had the simultaneous desires to put it away forever, keep looking through it and start making my own postcard-art secrets right away. I would have liked this book to have more pages for what it cost (since I know there are loads more postcards) but I suppose they wanted the pages to have the texture of postcards so they're awfully thick."
4,Super Size It!,"I wish this book had been offered in coffee table size. I understand publishing the postcards ""at normal size"" helps impart the poignancy and power and whimsy of some of the ""postsecrets"", but some of the artwork/collages/handwritten text could also have benefited by being upsized. Nothing would be lost if the book were super sized..."
1,The author is the confessor,The handwriting on the cover is the same as the handwriting on many of the postcards.
1,PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives,I felt this book was a waste of my money. I would not recommend this book.
2,"Um, no thanks","I was surprised with the amount of sexual confessions. I understood there might be a couple that fall into that category, but so many of the confessions were sexual. I really don't care to have this book around my house with children. I did like many of the other confessions that weren't sexual."
4,Good book...,"Good book, although it seems to be a ""read once"" type of thing. I plan on passing it along to friends now that I have looked at it. 4 stars because it does have a lot more content compared to 2nd released book."
3,I love the website but the book was disappointing...,"I truly love the PostSecret website and I'm always eager to check it out when it's updated on Sunday. I rushed to purchase it when it came out a couple weeks ago. Sadly, I was very disappointed. I was hoping for new, unused, postcards but instead I found mostly familiar ones that I've seen on his site before...and I've only been going there a couple of months now! I was also hoping for some commentary of some sort, I guess. It's really just page after page of postcards...I still strongly support the website and I'm thrilled to know that a portion of the proceeds go to a suicide hotline. I wish the book would've been a little better, however."
2,Intrigued but ambivalent,"The artwork on many of the postcards was intriguing, evocative, and perfectly-suited to the secret. The secrets were, however, far more often than not depressing or worrisome. While the writers of the secrets may have felt released by sending them off (and that fact is itself debatable), I felt weighed down by knowing their secrets. Additionally, I felt a little manipulated in that we have no way of knowing if the secrets are real or fiction -- did at least some of these writers create secrets in the hope of eliciting sadness and concern in the readers? We have no way of knowing and that ambiguity leads to my ambivalence."
3,Alright,"This book was alright. My opinion, it aint worth it. Just stick to postsecret.com every sunday."
3,not that great. i expected more from Thule,"I have been a Thule customer for years and have been pleased with every ""fit kit"" on many vehicles...except this one. I installed it on the factory roof rails on a 2005 Porsche Cayenne. The intallation was quick and easy, but it looked TERRIBLE installed. The fit looked obviously and cheaply ""one size fits all"" and the load bars were too high to look right. I ended up sending them back and bought the proper OEM ars and mounts from an internet Porsche dealer for only $60 more."
4,they are OK,I have only trial mounted the foot on my 06 explorer. It doesnb't seem to fit my wide side rails well and was concerned that they wouldn't work well. I was much more satisfied with rack feet for earlier explorer's. I don' have the factory cross rails and was most surprised to learn they cost less than the rack foot pack and should carry the same load. JAN 2009 NOW HAD THEM 1YR + AND THEY ARE STRONG ENOUGH BUT VERY NOISY AT HIGHER SPEEDS WITH MY FORD.
3,Romance was Drastically Overlooked,"Angela Bassett is my favorite actress. Ruby's Bucket of Blood is entertaining and interesting but too many elements side swap the romance. The romance between Ruby ( Bassett ) and Kevin Anderson ( I can't believe I forgot the character's name ) has great potential but takes the entire movie to get started. Then when it finally gets going the movie is over. The romance didn't build properly. The characters didn't learn enough about one another. There were missing scenes that allowed them to grow. You really need to show that growth when you're doing a romance especially an interracial one. So I was disappointed that we didn't see more Angela and Kevin scenes. I thought the film was supposed to be about Ruby, her husband and being in love with a white man but it turned into jamborees at her club. It's a nice movie to watch for a fun time but the romance element of the film is dead. That's unfortunate because Bassett and Anderson have a lot of chemistry."
5,A Beautiful Movie,"Ruby Delacroix (Angela Bassett) is a hard working mom and wife. She works too much to feed her teenage daughter Emerald (Jurnee Smollett) and her disrespectful husband Earl (Brian Stokes Mitchell). She runs a popular juke point on the Louisiana bayou called the Bucket of Blood. When Earl decides he can't live in the small town, he leaves Ruby and Emerald. Besides dealing with that issue, Ruby has to find another singer when her regular one quits the band. Things start to look up when band leader Johnny Beaugh (Glenn Plummer) brings in white singer Billy Dupree ( Kevin Anderson) to fill in. Resistant at first, Ruby hires him. With his talent and musical voice, Ruby changes her tune about Billy. Billy offers his friendship and comfort, which Ruby so desperately needs. What becomes an issue is Billy's wife Betty (Angelica Torn). Ruby's got too many issues to deal with and wonders if any of it is worth the price of happiness"
3,"Use your Brains, not follow your Heart.","The more thought I put into this movie, the more I'de rather not had seen it. Nothing is going to come out good when people cheat. Losing a child would put a strain on any relationship, but apparently they had other issues between them. This man knew that he wife was unstable, but like a man, ignored the signs for his own pleasures. Instead, he went after Angela Bassett knowing this affair would not be accepted under any reasonings in that day and age.As stated, this was a time when mixed races were not accepted. Sure Angela's husband ran out on her and her daughter, and she probably did feel lonely, but why risk danger to your family. She's still married herself and had a daughter to think of.Even though she did not do this crime, a high price was paid for cheating with a married white man. She and her daughter's lives were turned upside down, because now, they are on the run. I didn't like the ending, which should have been better for them."
3,"""Bucket of Blood""","I thought it was a good movie, however it did seem to leave some gaps in the story line."
2,2 stars b/c it kept me interested enough to finish watching,"I thought this movie reeked! Angela, you can do so much better!! Probably the best AA actress today.Anyway, this movie was terrible to me. I couldn't figure out she hooked up w/the white man. What was the point? A lot of loose ends. And why do most movies about interracial relationships have to end w/somebody dying?See it on Showtime or HBO--whichever it is. Don't buy it."
4,Engineered right,"Well formatted and documented. A lot more history and imperial information than engineering and technology, but it is the History Channel..."
5,Great service and product!,"This product was more than expected! It was brand new and came well before the estimated arrival date, which was good because I needed it for a class I teach. Nice work! Thanks!"
4,"Great, but only 1 Thing","This is great stuff, but the one thing is to realize it doesn't include Rome, Engineering An Empire. That's a separate purchase at this moment only available from the network's online store."
3,Should be called Engineering lite.,"While the series is interesting, and Weller does grow on you, I expected a bit more actual engineering. The computer graphics were good, but a little repetitive.Section on Carthage was pretty interesting. But my biggest dissatisfaction with the series is that EVERY civilization covered was the most innovative. The first to use this or do that. A little confusing by the end of the series. Kept thinking, ""Didn't those other people a few episodes ago do that too?"""
3,Not bad for beginners in history,"General overview, skips certain history, for example on the Persians, just focused on the feats of the Achamaenians while forgetting the Sassanians who were much later but had at least on par achievements. Same with Greeks, focused on very little."
2,"Not for engineers, architects, builders etc.","So here's the contrary review, from a disgruntled viewer. Everything the other reviewers said about the series and what it covers is correct - my complaint is that this is not about engineering, architecture or building. It is about war and the quest for power. I should have known, as this is what all History Channel shows are about. As a builder, I had hoped to see in depth coverage of the actual building / construction. Instead the focus is on empire, and the 'building' and consolidation of power in order to dominate. The music, the tension, the conflict - if you watch tv at all, this is nothing new to you. And if this is your thing, then by all means buy the set and enjoy. If you liked 'Troy' or the new 'Robin Hood' then you will love this series. But if you are, like I was, hoping to see all the good engineering behind the great civilizations and their incredible feats, this series will be a disappointment, as the coverage of such is very thin."
4,Great but definitely not a DVD,"This was an amazing deal for the $5 or $10 I spent for it. The moderator of the history channel show is hilariously cliche, but you've got to love it for that.The thing is, it's definitely not of DVD quality. It looks like it's been copied or the quality is DIVX or VCD. Nevertheless, the packaging, box, and DVD cases look authentic. What can I say?"
5,Great series,"In general I have been displeased with the currently quality of the shows on the History Channel.However, this series is both educational and just down right fascinating. Highly recommend."
4,INFORMATIVE,Very informative but I was really interested in mostly the engineering feats.The focus featured was the battles that raised or colapsed civilizations.
3,A bit too general...,"I bought this set for my husband for Christmas. I know very little about the subject (he's the left-brained one), but even so, I wanted more detail and commentary than the series provides. It's very general, with little talk about the engineering processes per se; too much time is wasted giving watered down histories of the people who are the subject of any particular episode.If you're looking for depth or details regarding engineering, or even the basic history of a people or period, I suggest you look somewhere else."
4,It's Pretty Good,"I really enjoyed this set. I felt that it would have been a little more interesting if it got into a little more detail on certain topics. Over all though, I thought that it was worth watching."
4,Enginerring an Empire CE: Great for Ameteur Historians,"I purchased this item a two years after i saw half of them aired on The History Channel. I enjoyed the non complex and informative delivery of each program and appreciated Peter Wellers' input into each episode. Rome and Egypt each last 90 minutes on average and cover much ground as well as the actual engineering aspect of the respective empires. The remaining twelve episodes, at 45 minutes apiece are just as entertaining. My only issure with this set overall is that it is not in a Hi-Def format. I have a 50"" Plasma with a nice home theater sound system that would have made this edition look and sound great. Other than that this was a satisfying purchase to view with kids and grand children. Nicely done."
2,"Great Series, Not in 16:9!!","The show is amazing. If you've never seen it, by all means check it out. But for those with decent home theatre setups and cable theres pretty much no reason to get this. I was VERY disappointed to see that this widescreen show is presented in 4:3 and not in 16:9. That means the entire show is windowboxed on my HDTV. The show appears with bars on the tops AND sides.A disappointing DVD transfer."
4,Ginormous spider!,The photo is deceiving. This thing is huge! It's close to the size of an Amazonian Tarantula. The leg span is over a foot in width.
4,Good easy read,"This book has the information you need for the clerkship and is easy to get through (most chapters, anyway). However it's not a good prep book if you're studying for the shelf: it's too long, and material tested on the shelf is different. Most of the shelf is medicine, which is not emphasized in the book at all. That said, I still think it was a very good introductory surgery text."
4,Lawrence-True Essentials of Surgery,"I inititally bought this text in my second year of medical school. It was both an exceptionally detailed text and also a good reference on a wide variety of subjects. I have continued to use it into my surgical residency and expect to do so until I finish. My only detractions are that on occasion it is too densely packed with information, and that the section on peptic ulcer disease and the surgical treatment of the same is a little dated. Otherwise, any topic that a student needs to know about on a general surgical service is _well_ covered by this text."
3,Too much to read.,"This book is so long and wordy, It's a great reference for surgical topics, but so hard to read. It is not a good review book, and i would say not a book to read during your rotation in surgery since you probably wouldn't have enough free time to read the entire thing. It is a good book, don't get me wrong, but I find it's too much for 3rd yr rotation material."
5,Wonderful Book,"Stephanie Bond's Club Cupid is simply delightful. The sexual tension between Frankie and Randy is sizzling and the characters are well developed. Bond has a wonderful talent with words and I look forward to reading more books from her.Joanne Rock's story is a short one. It is only about 100 pages long, but it is a nice sweet story."
1,Waste of Time,"This book contains two stories: Club Cupid by Stephanie Bond and Valentine Vixen by Joanne Rock. Club Cupid is a reissue of a story originally published in 1999, and Valentine Vixen is a very short story that is thoroughly boring and unenjoyable. Club Cupid is slightly better, but the book - overall - is not worth wasting your money on. The stories are both too simple; the characters do not have enough depth or feeling, the `romances' are unbelievable, and the writing is generic."
4,sick belt!!!,This is a sick belt! Ive had it for about 2 weeks and it looks really good when I go sk8en. Its total punk sk8er like and looks awseome.
3,c'est d'accord,"As I'm not as big a fan of Carne's filmas the author of this book appears to be, I'm probably not the best qualified to review her study. While I admire the amount of research that has obviously gone into it, her understanding of the histotical and cultural traditions to which it belongs, the film itself seems to get lost somewhere. Unlike many books in the series, we learn little about the author herself and the impact it's had on her life. The historical information is interesting, but it didn't make me want to rush out and watch the movie again."
5,Interesting,It was a rather interesting book as what goes on with the doctor and the patient. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Very one-sided,"This book was written by someone who had sour grapes about her job. It's easy to criticize the few bad apples, but we forget all of the drug cures that the same pharmaceutical industry has produced."
1,Very one-sided,I will keep this short.Do drug companies want to make profits? Yes. Do drug companies create drugs that save lives? Yes. Are SSRIs over prescribed? Yes. Have SSRIs saved the lives of millions of severly depressed people? Yes. It's a mixed bag.
2,A presentation that tries to include too many areas,"Although the author of this book has tried to expose the corruption and malice of the drug industry, I have the feeling she is like a member ofAA who is trying to accomplish the twelve steps by correcting all her mistakes to clear her conscience.The presentation certainly airs the training of drug reps. and how for power and dollars, they are duped into thinking they are serving physicians and patients.The author gets into medical explanations regarding the drugs, a fieldin which she is not trained and a field of expertise that she should leave to professionals.The end of the book deals with her spiritual discovery and that is admirable, but I question whether it is properly placed in a book that has tried to courageously stepped forward to inform the public about the corruption of the drug industry and those who support it."
5,A Wake Up Call to the Human Race,"One of Ms. Olsen's most vital messages is that life's problems are spiritual in nature, not medical. As long as our society looks to ""experts"" who do not admit the existence of the human spirit and view us as animals and collections of chemicals, the solutions we are offered will continue to bark up the wrong tree. And the concept that some people's brains are ""wired differently"" denies people their personal sense of responsibility for their own health and happiness. This is particularly cruel and tragic when it is done to children.This book should be required reading at all medical schools and pharmacy colleges. It should be on the shelves of every university book store, law library, theological seminary, and teaching college. Ms. Olsen has given a wake-up call to the human race, and it's one that we dare not ignore!"
5,Mooooving Perspective....,"Being around cattle for the better part of my life, I knew that there were many biproducts that we get from cows, but Almabeth really enlightened me on just how valuable this creature really is to all of us. The message to the reader is told through a dream by a young boy and the author does a wonderful job of illustrating just how dependent we are on this animal in our every day life. I enjoyed this book very much."
4,Excellent training guide for Pilot license,"I started off with the FAA publications which were dry and hard to comprehend. Then ordered this book- wow what a refreshing change! Easy, clear with tons of colorful illustrations.A great way to prepare for the exam and training."
5,The best out there,"This is an outstanding publication with exceptional content--it's thorough, comprehensive, and a bargain. If you have to buy just publication, this is the one to buy."
1,"Hypocritical convicted felon, plus he's racist!","I happened to see one episode of this show and I thought Chapman was an egotistical idiot. Later I found out that he himself is a convicted felon. Also, in case you missed it, he loves to use the N-word."
2,Above reviews are obviously fake,"For the price you would expect a heavy duty trident spear tip, the one they give you is the cheep CHINA type that will break off after you miss your first bullfrog,(the picture is deceptive). The pole is ok but you will need a differnt tip if you expect to do any serious frog gigging."
3,All but the ending,"the book does well in the beginning and keeps pace trough the story at an entertaining rate.the story unfolds nicly, and the finale has a nice setup.and then the story goes all disney on you the last 10 pages&#12290;are about as un `hellblazer` as you can get. to cut it short w/o spoiling anything, it is&#12288;happy."
2,Just because Constantine has the potty mouth---,"This book has all the right things to make it a good novel. So why does The Raven only give it a measly two stars? Three words: Excessive language use. A character like John Constantine can be expected to use colorful language. Not a problem. In the real world, people express themselves in any number of colorful or off-color ways. But when the writer begins to add the words as part of the text, not conversation, I begin to wonder about the author's imagination. Isn't there a better way to say that without resorting to ""gutter language?"" The Raven thinks so. It is unrealistic to think that characters should not give way to full expression, it makes the character more human; you think: ""Yeah, I know a bloke like that! Sounds just like him!"" But in the context of the writing, it becomes: ""Can't he think of another word? I'm tired of reading the f-word all the time!""Quoth the Raven...."
1,Entertainment,I don't know how accurate was to the series but for me this felt like a vehicle for the authors own political viewpoints. Plus some of the other reviewers said this guy invented cyber punk. Was this at the same time Al Gore invented the internet?Probably just some old guy straggling to make a car payment doing this stuff until he can retire.
4,Super Reader,"This was good. Shirley is a good writer, and a decent fit for this milieu. He has managed some of the laugh out loud funny Constantine lines, and even an 'alternate reality' movie joke, given he wrote the movie novelisation, as well.He manages to portray JC as we know him, a bastard, a friend, a scary sorcerer, a drunk, etc.The adversary is a nasty Sumerian among others minor godling, that John had tangled with in a past life.Definitely worth it."
5,Black Market Militia - Best Album of 2005?,"Black Market Militia is a group composed of tremendous talent. Coupled with amazing production value, this album packs power few can compete with. The beats are absolute fire, wonderfully sampled, and very diverse. But beats don't make an album exceptional, that's where the Black Market comes in. The lyrics carry a practical revolutionary philosophy. They relate political turmoil to local street issues. On top of that, they also discuss important conflicts throughout the world in a way that empowers the listener, hence the word ""militia"" in their name. They're not as revolutionary as, for instance, Immortal Technique , but that's where they shine. They're able to convey their message with just the right energy. This is an album that is dynamic enough to discuss as well as entertain. Black Market Militia is where I'd like hip-hop to be in the future. Don't let this album pass you by. Pick it up."
4,better than i thought,"With good, new hip-hop albums becoming more and more rare these days, I thought that Black Market Militia would be okay at best. Boy was I wrong. This is a great album. The albums highlights are Gem Stars(good old fashioned SAMPLE BASED HIP-HOP!), Think Market(beat is blazin!), and Thug Nation. Pick this up if you like Killah Priest or Wu-Tang, you'll love it."
2,It was brave of the author to publish this book,"I opened Ether Ore at random, the first time I encountered it, and read the partial sentence at the top of the left-hand page. It said: ""...a physical sensation so strong as to be almost tangible."" I quickly slammed the book shut again so I wouldn't be distracted from my immediate sense of awe.That sense never entirely dissipated. I challenge anyone to remain unmoved while reading aloud from the scene with the buobs.I don't want to spoil anyone's enjoyment of the plot, so I'll limit myself to observing that cute little Melody wakes up at the end and discovers it's all been a dream. Yes, really. As another reviewer said, it's a cathartic experience.Ether Ore is a slight and foolish book; but while it doesn't reach the towering heights of Black Body, it nonetheless points the way to that landmark work."
1,do not buy,"Zero instructional use. A bunch of paintings laid out and described by the authors. Thankfully I didn't buy it brand new. Ranks among the worst instructional/self help books I ever bought, right there with How to Treat Your Own Knees which gives you guidance on how to walk on a treadmill."
1,Horrible product,Worst cable I ever bought. This is the first HDMI cable I bought because I didn't do any research years ago. It sucked the first day I bought it. It still sucks now. Always had to tinker with it to get it to work right. I got it from Best Buy along with my TV. Paid 39.99 I believe. Since then I have bought these cables...[...]You can get 6ft cables for 4.99 and 10ft cables for 5.99. With over 500 reviews and a 5 star rating on Newegg you can't go wrong. Don't waste your money on crap like Rocketfish or similar products that want to charge you ridiculous amounts.
2,Rocketfish HDMI cable,"I have two of these cables and have been dissapointed so far. The cable is pretty stiff making it harder to plug in. Now that i have the cables plugged in, because of the stiffness the outer cover is coming apart. As other people have mentioned, the gold plated cover on the end has fallen off of both of my cables. somehow i managed to put them back on and continue to use the cable but im sure this will affect quality over time, most likely leading to the cable not working at all. The cables work just fine and give good quality picture, they are just cheaply made."
2,Loose connector,Gold part became loose within the plug and TV signal became eratic until one day no matter how I tweaked the position of the (rather stiff) cable no signal could be detected. I either got a bad one that slipped by or the quality is lacking. I replaced it with a Radio Shack cable which feels more flexible and package states it has a shielding to bridge the gap between wire and connector. Hope it holds up better than the Rocketfish.
1,AVOID THIS OVERPRICED JUNK,"Have had zero luck with two of these cables. If you try and remove them from a tight fitting connection, they will separate and the gold plug portion remains in the output, leaving you looking at multiple individual wires and a $70 cable that is now worthless."
1,More like Rocketsh*t,"So I have a Samsung BD-P1600 player and these Rocketfish 4' cables. Blu-rays played fine, but upscaled videos would make my tv's video occasionally blink and the audio occasionally snap and pop (ocassionally meaning roughly 25-50% of the run-time of a video). I thought it was my BD player that was bad. Nope, I just tried different cables with the player, and no more problems! Rocketfish is an overpriced POS brand. Stay away."
4,WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT OF TIME AND MONEY,"Very few surgical fields demand a complete and comprehensive knowledge of the entire human body. Plastics and reconstructive surgery is right up there when it comes to that. A successful Plastic surgeon incorporates knowledge of Gross anatomy, microscopic anatomy, tissue physiology, physiology of the patient itself and the innate aesthetic sense to recreate from tissue and prosthesis alike.Grabb and Smith's text offers a comprehensive and engaging review of the essential aspects of Plastic surgery. Each Chapter starts with a review of clinical anatomy and leads on to Clinical aspects of diease. Historically important surgical approaches as well as current techniques are discussed. Disease classification is also described in excellent details through the use of tables.I do firmly believe that this book is a worthwhile investment of time and money."
2,Great for medical students and residents on a plastics rotation. Junk for any one else,"In their attempt to creat a ""comprehensive"" textbook for plastics in one volume what they have actually created is a basic review text lacking any of the details a true plastic surgeon or plastic surgery fellow would need. I read this text and then placed it on my shelf and have not touched it since I started my fellowship. There are more definitive volumes that give you more information in a better format than this one does. Don't waste your money."
1,Impossible to read....,"Allow me to state up front that I have not reviewed any of the actual text in this book. I have eagerly awaited the release of the new edition of Grabb and Smith for some time. However, upon its receipt I discovered that the font seems to have shrunk and the text appears to be single-spaced - I imagine in an effort to keep the text down to one volume. What they have succeeded in doing, though, is to make the text virtually impenetrable without a ruler to keep track of which line you are reading and a set of loupes to clearly see the text. I would have been happy to have had the text split into 2 volumes in order to make it easier to read.In any event, I kept it for approximately 2 weeks and made multiple attempts to pick it up and read it, but each time gave up as soon as I opened it due to the immediate headache I received. Ultimately, I returned it and resigned myself to 10 more years of the 5th edition.....PRS Resident"
2,Fair But Beware,"The program works well, but only on my XP machine. I couldn't get it to workon my Vista machine at all. There is a download from Imaginova but it's 130meg download. (You get a whole bunch of other updates at onetime) There's no single patch for making this program compatable with Vista."
3,Does not work on Windows Vista,"This latest version of Starry Night Pro 6, as of late June 2007, does not work on Windows Vista. Amazingly, even though Vista has been out for five months, the manufacturer of this Starry Night software does not know when they will have an update available to make it work on Vista. I bought this program over two months ago from Amazon, and I have not been able to install it or use it.The only reason I am giving this 3 stars instead of 1 star, is that I am familiar with previous versions of this program on previous computers, so I know it is potentially a wonderful program. But that doesn't do me (or you) much good, if you can't install it on a new computer running with Windows Vista. If you have a Vista-based computer, or are planning to upgrade your computer to Vista, do not waste your money on Starry Night Pro 6, until the manufacturer gets around to making a Vista-compatible version."
2,Still no Vista Compatibility,"I'm fully on Vista x64 now, except for QuickTime and Starry Night. In fact since running Vista as one of the beta testers, the only BSODs I've ever received were from QuickTime and Starry Night!I've used Starry Night on XP, where it works fine. The only problem is, I don't run XP any more. I'd give it 4 stars (the UI is waaaay too quirky, in my opinion -- too much Java under the covers), except that I can't run it at the moment."
5,A must have for ANY drummer,"Great Book and play along CD! Every and any drummer can benefit greatly from Tommy Igoe's extensive knowledge of all things groove! I am primarily a rock drummer, and Groove Essentials is helping me expand my horizons into other musical styles in a concise, easy to follow and understand format. From World, Funk, R&B, Jazz to Rock...it's all covered. The play-along CD also makes it a fun process. (Check out his the Groove Essentials DVD also...that's where it started for me...)"
4,Just Starting or Wanting to exel in Your Drumming Skills?,"I would recommend this product but not by itself. You really need the DVD too, because the music is from the lessons but in full length. I'm diggin the variety of grooves and there's something for every drummer whether your just starting out or you think your ready to go on tour!"
4,A Recommendation For Any Serious Drummer,"This book has almost everything any seriously ambitious drummer needs, its helped me alot, building my style, technical playing and my basic rhythm and groove skills. The tracks provided to play along with on the cd are great and the variety and content is also excellent. A Recommendation For Any Serious Drummer."
5,get it now,great book the best out there its helpoing my son a great deal all ready i would get it if your think about it and a great price
5,Great Book,Great book I use to teach with.Quick receive time from sender. I would recommend this book to anyone. Good experience.
4,Great drum,Good quality. Bought for my 2.5 year old who has a natural love for music. He loves it and so do we. We purchased a bunch of instruments for Christmas and we have family band time all the time. He really gets a good beat going but it could use another drum stick. We will be ordering the ones with the black felt balls to use instead of the little stick that came with it.
5,A great drum for a beginner,"I bought this drum for my 3 years old's birthday, the sound is brilliant, my son absolutely loves it !!"
5,Great for little kids,"This drum can satisfy the little one's desire to make some noise without being too loud. So far, it's been durable and does the job. TIP: Put it on a sofa or padded chair to muffle some of the sound when necessary."
3,It's Good But Not Great.,"I was so excited to receive this drum in the mail for my youngster. I think after reading all the reviews that my expectations were too high. The drum is well made and very cute. However, the sound was just ho hum. The plastic stick it comes with is just dinky and it seems silly to just have one anyway (shouldn't there be two?). It was a little too ""tin"" sounding for my liking and so I returned it and upgraded to a Remo Kids Percussion Gathering Drum instead (which included two mallets) which, although more than twice as much, was much more of the quality of sound that I was going for especially if I am going to be listening to it everyday."
5,Great Little Drum,"My grandson is delighted with this drum. It is sturdy and light, made of quality materials...has a nice sound-very pleased."
4,Nice Head Gear,"This bridal is a nice all around set of head gear. The leather could be a little softer on the hands, but it'll do it's job really well. Nice and simple, pro, very sleek. I do recommend it as a working bridal or exercise bridal.God Bless"
3,New Brown Flat Hunt Leather Snaffle Bridle with Laced Rein,I like the leather and how it looks but I thought It came with a Snaffle Bit. By looking at the pictures it looks like it has one but is not mentioned in the description. I would have liked to know if the bit needed to be purchased seperatly.
5,Truely one of the best books I've ever read.,"If you love fantasy then get ready to be blown away. Action, romance, and mystery, are the only words you have to use to discribe this well written book. I did not like fantasy before I read this book, but now I realize that I was very wrong. So even if you dont think you like fantasy, just read this book and I bet you will change your mind."
4,Another great Xanth book,"I love the Xanth series, and this was no exception. I don't recommend this book for anyone who hates puns, though, as it is chock full of them, just like the others. As usual, Mr. Anthony provides characters who are fantastic, yet we Mundanes can indentify with. Who hasn't felt that they don't belong? Or wondered how they will find a sould mate? We have all had a crush we know can't work out. But most of us have not had to deal with these things while on an adventure through a magical land while solving riddles and running from dragons. If you liked other Xanth novels, you'll like this one. And, best of all, this series can be read out of order. I don't recommend it, but it can be done. Pick up any Xanth book, and you will enjoy it."
4,Upbeat Xanth,"I know some of you are getting tiered of the Xanth series and even I agree that the last couple of books have started to lag behind Anthony's previous works, but he puts that behind him in this book. Harpy Thyme takes a fresh Xanth-like look at segregation and discrimination in its usual fluffy background. As common with most of Anthony's books its almost impossible to put this one down till your done"
5,"very, very cool","This has got to be one of the weirdest books I've ever read. But don't get me wrong..that's a good thing! This is the first Piers Anthony book I've read, and I hope he has more like this."
4,Abacus Co-Pilot v3.0,"Product generally met my expectations and is a useful tool for flight planning. As advertized, the shipped item was v3.0 and was upgraded (on-line, by Abacus) to version 3.5... no problems."
2,not good just will not run,"well I got this titel copilot v3 in a batch of 6 abacus add-on I got carrier ops WW2, vietnam carrier ops, ventures and whirybirds all for fs 2002/2004 of the six copilot is the only one that did not work. it did not seem to install and did not apper any were in the game, this may be that I am running windows 7 or the other updates I ran, I just don't know but I payed less then $30.00 for the 6 and all but copilot ran without a problem"
1,Too light,"These stands are very light in weight, they can tip over very easy due to its small and light base."
5,Good Selection of Songs,"Nice selection of songs/artists on various disks. Seller was fast and friendly. He contacted me after I made the purchase to ask if I wanted an excel spreadsheet with all the songs/artists and lyrics for any of the songs he had. As pictured and promised, great service."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"This product was not easy to use. The car seat was very difficult to snap into the stroller. It didn't even latch properly in the stroller position. Worst of all, the car seat was terrible to install. The narrow base wobbled back and forth, and eventually the straps on the base broke off! This product was frustrating to use. The Chicco travel system is much safer and easier to use. I do not recommend buying the Eddie Bauer model!"
1,Base is horrible.,"4 certified installers at local fire station spent 2 hours trying to get the base to fit correctly...including the use of noodles. The seat base is simply a poor design which needs to be corrected. The installers said they would not put their kids in the car seat, so I was not going to risk putting our daughter in it."
1,I would not recommend.,This thing is terrible. I love the looks of it but it is a piece of junk. The base is to narrow so it tips over all the time if you dont wedge it up against the front seat. My child does not fit in it anymore and he is only 3 months old. He weighs 16 lbs and the straps are to tight. (I even took it to the fire station to make sure I was not doing something wrong) Last but not least while I am carrying the car seat around the screws just keep falling out of the handle no matter how tightly we screw them in. Absolute piece of junk.
1,Car Seat Base Does NOT Work,"The design of the car seat base is very defective. There is no possible way to get it tight enough. I could pull on the front of the base with one finger and flip it right out of the LATCH belt (that was pulled as tight as humanly possible). In addition, the car seat carrier was difficult to secure on the base and difficult to get off, losening the belt even further with each attempt. I returned it for the Graco Oakwood and could not believe how complicated and unsafe this Eddie Bauer Travel System is in comparison. Two thumbs way down!!!"
2,don't do it!!!!,"Thinking about this system? DONT DO IT! I really regret this purchase.The stroller is HUGE and very bulky and quite heavy. Sure it passed all of the safety protocols, but I wished I would have read a review from a consumer before buying this. I had the average travel system (Graco)for my first 2 kids years ago. I thought I was upgrading, and found myself wanting the less expensive system. The infant seat is fine, but I suggest saving the box and receipt and try fitting it in your trunk space, and going thru the motions. You'll probably return it after that. Save yourself the time and much needed energy."
2,Not a Travel System!!!,"I bought this because my wife and I love Eddi Bauer. We have SUVs and therefore, we wanted the Eddi Bauer products to match. My baby came 2 week before his due date. When my dad and I tried to put the system together we notice that this is NOT a travel system because a lot of things are on the way. In other words, it takes a lot to fold it and unfold it. It takes to much time to put it together (Imagine your wife alone put it in together and with the baby. Also, it is to heavy when it comes to travel. I agree that products have to be durable but this Travel System is just too heavy.The car seat is very unsafe. It moves all over the place. When my wife and my baby came out of the hospital the nurse said that the base should not be that unstable.Make sure before you to ""test drive it"" it look awesome but it is not the best. I am going to return it and get something better."
1,Waste of money! Don't let the look of this combo fool you!,"This product is unsafe and way to heavy. The pictures of the base tipping over are no understatement. We tried everything to try to secure this car seat in both of our vehicles. Each time we thought we had pulled the belt as tight as possible only to turn around and see the carseat tips over every time. We tried the latch hook system and the regular seatbelt. If you have not looked through the example pictures above, do it now to see how unsafe this seat could be in a traffic accident. The stroller did look nice and rode smooth but way to heavy for everyday travel. We took this system back and bought the Graco Travel system. It is so much more secure and also weighs less. Which we really appriciate now that our baby is almost 16 lbs. Good luck hope this review helps!"
1,Car Seat Base is completely unsafe!,"I too received the Travel System as a gift. The stroller we absolutely love. The car seat base however is completely unsafe. Following the directions to the T on installing the base, we were able to flip the chair over and side to side. I truly do not want my baby in a seat that is not secure. We've called the company to complain as there seems to be no recalls on this particular model, and they have let us know that they have re-designed the base and will be sending it out to us free of charge. I just don't understand why they don't reissue a new base as part of a recall. We'll test it out an see if it works. If not, we are getting a new car seat!California New Mom!"
3,"Nice, but way too large for my car!","I got this off of eBay for cheap it was brand new! I was sent it in Ballard instead of Mercer (no biggie).I own a car, it won't work with a car. This product is HUGE. You would have to own a truck or a larger SUV to put the stroller in. It doesn't collapse into a compact position good.The carseat doesn't fit well into the stroller as well and is very loose. I really don't like the item, but if you own a larger vehicle and know how to put these things together better than I can then this would work.stores.ebay.com/nightmarerealm <--- where this item will be sold this week on auction if anyone wants to bid. I am located in the Sacramento area you can pick it up from me as well."
1,UNSAFE CARSEAT,"I AM WRITTING THIS REVIEW AS A VERY ANGRY AND UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. THIS CARSEAT IS VERY UNSAFE!! MORE THAN ONCE WITH MY SON IN THE SEAT WITH AND WITHOUT THE BASE THE CARSEAT HAS TIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE. NOT ONLY DOES IT TURN OVER ONTO ITS SIDE IT MOVES AROUND ALL OF THE TIME. I TOOK IT TO THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO SEE IF MAYBE I HAD INSTALLED IT INCORRECTLY AND THEY TRIED EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT SECURE AND COULDN'T. THEY SAID IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS AND A POSSIBLE HAZARD SEAT. THEY ADVISED ME TO GET ANOTHER ONE AND TAKE IT BACK. SO I TRIED TO TAKE IT BACK AND BABIES R US TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL ME AND THAT I NEEDED TO GO THROUGH EDDIE BAUER TO SEE IF I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK. I FEEL IF THEY SELL THE PRODUCT THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REFUND. I EVEN HAD A RECEIPT. SO NOT ONLY AM A GIVING THE CAR SEAT A BAD REVIEW BUT ALSO THE STORE AND THEIR RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. FOR YOUR CHILD'S SAFETY, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TRAVEL SYSTEM."
1,I don't recommend this car seat...,"The car seat is very heavy and cumbersome and the screws have fallen out. We could not replace them because the screw holes were stripped. The car seat tips over if we don't tighten the belt everytime. It has nothing to do with the year of the car, we have a brand new SUV. We even had the base installed by an EMT at the police station car seat check, and she even commented on how difficult it was to secure. I am going to exchange it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I recieved this stroller as a gift. My husband and I loved the color and the stroller, but when it came to installing it in the car, it was completly unsafe. I just want to notify all parents who have received this stroller, take it back if you can and call the Dorel Juvenille Company. The company will try to make you feel like you are full of it, don't give up.They tried to tell it was my car, but I have a 2006 Pontiac Torrent, which in all parents magazines and crash tests is highly recomended for car seats. My husband and I both argued with then so much we finally got our money back, but that is still not the fact that this is the most unsafe seat ever. We have since purchased the Graco Safe Seat and Quatro stroller which do not move at all!! They are both terrific."
1,Make sure it fits your car....,We got this travel system as a gift. At first we really loved it but when we went to put the car seat into the car's it fit fine in our SUV but you have to pull very tight on the straps to keep it from moving side to side. When we put it in our acura was another story. Since we didnt have the latch system in this car we had a hard time getting the base to stay tight so then we took the base out and the seat belt wouldnt go around the back of the car seat. So make sure you try it out before you buy it!!!
4,love it,I have read a few reviews about the base and i will have to admitt that it is a bit tricky. I knew from reviews i would have trouble putting it in my car so i went to BRU on one of their car seat check days which i am assuming all of them have once a month. Well this was the first time they have ever put in a car base like this one and after several failed attempts they tried on last thing and it worked. They used Noodles (the foam things kids use for swimming) that were cut to make shorter. It took 3 of these put under the base to make it high enough to stay in place. They said the movement was due to the seat cusions being soft and they have a dip in them. They said they need to use these with many car seats to get them to fit in cars properly. So anyone who may have a problem getting this in their car securly might want to try this or use rolled up towels. Other than that this is a beautifull travel system and cant wait for my little on to arive so i can use it.
4,New MoM Question,"Hi, I am a new mom my baby will be born in 2 months, I will like to know if any of you mom's out there know if the base is safe because it looks so different from all the others i see, please let me know thank you so much.."
1,VERY DANGEROUS,"I PURCHASED THE EDDIE BAUER TRAVEL SYSTEM AND WHILE I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE STROLLER, OTHER THEN A NIGHTMARE TO FIT INTO A SUV, THE CAR SEAT IS DANGEROUS. I DROVE TO MY LOCAL POLICE PRECINCT TO SEE IF I HAD INSTALLED IT CORRECTLY AND THEY TOLD ME TO GET RID OF IT. WHEN YOU MAKE A TURN OR GO OVER A BUMP THE WHOLE SEAT TIPS TO THE SIDE. IT DOES NOT STAY SECURELY IN THE SEAT AND IS DEFINATELY A DANGER. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL ON IT. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
1,Great stroller -- but car seat a safety nightmare,"Should have read the reviews first!The stroller is heavy - but extremely durable and comfortable for both baby and parent (to push obviously!). Lots of pockets, easy to use, etc. If I could purchase JUST the stroller - I might.The car seat is a nightmare. First, no instructions on how to anchor to car -- so who knows if it's right or not. Second, once properly attached, it wobbles from side to side because the thing is so damn narrow at the end. The seat can literally fall from side to side if you twist it. I can only imagine what would happen in an accident.The bottom line: my wife and I were not willing to take the risk. We exchanged it for a Graco model, with a very wide and stable base. Sure, it's not an Eddie Bauer, but it is $20 cheaper and the peace of mind is priceless."
1,Advice For First-Time Stroller Shoppers,"Here's what I've learned. I was very disappointed when shopping for a travel system at the selection of colors (we are not finding out the gender so it needs to be neutral). So I bought this one because I loved the look. After reading the reviews and talking to a very knowledgeable sales clerk who strongly advised against this system, I returned it.Here was the breakthrough: I was under the impression that to get a stroller that had the feature of the attachable car set, I had to look at a ""travel system"". Not true! If you don't mind spending a little more, there are many more options if you buy the stroller and the car seat combination separately. The seat still connects to the stroller with all the benefits of a travel system. I am excited about the Graco Quattro Roxy that we purchased. By far superior to the Eddie Bauer and in a neutral (somewhat sporty) pattern that we liked."
1,not safe,"I can only join the crowd of reviews, dont buy this stroller! Besides all the safety issues;this stroller is extremely hard to manoeuvre. The wheels will get stuck at first in every door you pass, every clothingrack in a departmentstore and every table leg at a restaurant etc. The stroller is so heavy that it is also hard to lift stairs."
4,Do what they should,These are strong. I haven't had any problems with them holding items or things together. What I expected and am pleased with product.
1,Utterly dissappointing.....,"I am a diehard Scooby fan and have been waiting for this game with much anticipation. I thank my lucky stars I rented before buying. I cannot stress enough how bad this game is. PLEASE at least rent before buying. The game is so programmed....do this, do that, do this, do that. There is little opportunity to explore your own ideas with the game. The character movement throughout the game is horrible. The jotstick needs to be let go of after entering each room to reset itsself! Who wants to take the time to do this when running from the Knight?!?!? I was depressed after trying to play this game for an hour, it was such a let-down."
2,Read this review for the truth about the game...,"Before writing this review, I read some of the others. Most people either said that the game was excellent or very poor. I find that the game ranks somewhere in the middle. If the people who designed the game are reading this......WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? This is the most difficult 64 game to control that has been released. I know what you're thinking. ""I can probably get used to it, I bet this guy didn't even play it that much...."" Wrong! Every move you make is determined by the camera angle. Most of the time, when you want to move one way, you end up moving another. And buy the way, I couldn't figure out whose side Scooby Doo is on. He is in your way ALL THE TIME. There is no way around him. When being chased buy a villain, he practically pushes you into them. And finally, there are only three levels. I have two words for the developers of the game.....EXPANSION PAK"
2,aarrgghh,"I'm very sorry but the game it's not worth the money. The graphics are 'SMASH'. In fact, the only good thing about it is the voices are from the t.v show. Please don't spend $ on it."
2,"Scooby doo animation is ""ruff"" !","Scooby Doo Classic Creep Capers is not a very animated game, Everything has to be read, and the only sounds are bumps from the villains, or scooby saying ""reah""! I bought this believing it would be as animated as most games are now,but it seems to be from the 70's animation. I would not recommend buying this before you try it...the company needs to either lower the price, or bring the animation into our new millenium!"
4,Amusing,"Nine betrothals and three dead husbands in her young life have made Lady Megge a bit tired of the whole courtship process. Before she can be tied to yet one more man she neither knows nor wants, she decides to take counter measures. All the women of Castle Rising go on strike, no sex until the men agree to their terms. The desperate men turn to Sir Olyver, who happens to be the next man chosen for Megge, though she does not know this, to end the siege and get their women back. The only way to penetrate an impenetrable castle, it would seem, would be to get through to Megge's heart. This is no mean feat. Megge is every bit as intelligent and determined as any man, with paragons such as Eleanor of Aquatane and Boudecia as her ideals.*** Told in the manner of a classic Richard Burton or Katherine Hepburn movie, this quick witted page turner will keep you laughing until the end. ***Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,I Loved Loved this Light-Hearted Romance!!,"Loved, Loved, loved, this book almost as much as Jennie Klassel's debut novel. The biggest problem I have with Ms. Klassel is that she literally dropped out of sight after these two books. If you like wit and great dialogue in your stories (a little low on steam, tho) I highly recommend her books."
1,I couldn't believe it!,"Normally I like to read anything and everything. It doesn't take much to get me interested in a book and my interest is usually held throughout the whole thing. But this book was one of the worst romance books I've ever read! It started out promising, but the ending was horrible! I kept expecting it to pick up as I read on, but before I knew it, I was at the last few pages and the ending left me more confused and disappointed than I ever thought possible. This is my first review of a book on Amazon and I'm writing because I had to warn others before they made the same mistake I made I did when I bought this book. If you want to read a real romance novel, read any of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. They are the most amazing historical romance books I've ever read! You won't be disappointed."
4,Great system for that price,"Bought from costco for $179.99. Good enough for my bedroom. And I did not hear the hissing sound previous reviewer mentioned, I believe it must be something related at his/her home."
4,Finally it worked!,I wish the technical support Philips offers was better! It is pathetic!!Bought System I from Target and wired it up. Fantastic sound but the progressive scan pic was red. Called up Philips service but the bloke had no clue. Returend the system thinking it was defective. Enter system II - Panasonic - pathetic sound but good pic. Not so simple to wire. Returned this too! Enter system III - Philips again - red pic again - but this time I was sure that there has to be something wrong with the settings to have 2 sets with the same problem so drilled into the settings and finally got the system working!This system is good value for money indeed!
1,Hissing is a Bad Thing,"We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco. It is possible that the newer ""D"" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode. We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder. When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room. It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful. I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all. Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again.** Update** This player only lasted a couple years. Now it is trash."
1,Horrible DVD player,"I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives ""Bad Disc"" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point."
2,Not worth it,"We bought this last year for my in-laws and as with many, the DVD player already quit working after less than 10 uses. When we purchased the item, it also did not come with all the parts and when we called customer service, we could not give them the serial number because it had been scratched off with a knife (note to other sellers, only buy from Amazon and not third party seller if you aren't looking for a unit with the numbers scraped off). The surroud sound works pretty well, but it seems useless to have such a terrible quality DVD player with it. I think it would be better to just buy a system without a player built in and buy a player to hook up. We will definitely learn from our mistake with this one."
4,Outstanding Value and Performance - Complete Package,This is truly a complete system. In addition to excellent CD/DVD performance the built-in AM/FM stereo system is excellent.The surround sound on BOTH DVD's AND Cable broadcasts will surprise you.The system even simulates surround sound when the source is simple in stereo.You will love this system.It is best used in small to medium rooms. It might be inadequate in very large family rooms.The sound system has adequate power to fill your room and provide impressive sound effects. Planes will fly from front to rear and side to side.
3,It's Ok,"Just got it for Xmas. I installed it in minutes having absolutely no problems. The sound is good but I think Philips could improve a little bit as it is a 700 Watt system. It sounds less than that.First of all the DVD plays very well, yet I haven't tried to play any MP3's so far so I don't know how that works. Honestly I don't care. I play music from my computer anyway. The bad thing is that when I put it on TV mode it seems to me that only one front left speaker picks up the sound and the rear one a bit. The rest remain silent. I'm not sure if this is the unit's fault or my TV's or the dish network box. The rear speakers are good but I thought they could be a bit louder as it is supposed to be surround system. When the unit is on stand by I hear some hissing noise. I guess it's the A/V transformer.Overall it's a good unit. If you have the money, go with Panasonic which is slightly over $300 but sounds better."
3,Entertaining not gotta have info,"This book was hillarious and very entertaining. Definately not a guide for serious info if you want to know if its just a date or coffee. Girl to girl dating can be confusing and unclear most of the time. Learned nothing from the text, if anything reminesced about former dates that turned bad that I can laugh at now."
5,One MO Time Around The Block,"""Is It A Date Or Just Coffee"" was a hilarious trip through the confusing and sometimes neurotic gay girl dating scene. Mo uses her singular gift of humor to make the lesbian dating game less awkward and daunting. With chapters like ""Blind Date: Think Hunters and Ducks"" you know your in for a comic treat! I laughed and cried with Mo over the dating disasters and triumphs. An absoulte must for the newly ""out"" - it will help calm your nerves."
3,Becoming a Master Manager,I felt that this was a very good book for a beginning management student. It tounched on the basics but did not go very in depth on any on the theroies. This text book touched on the various roles of managers which was very good but it failed to go any further than that. I would not reccommend this text book for classes that need to go in depth into the subject of management.
3,Becoming a Master Manager,"This book was a ok tool, we used it in our intro. to management class. I found it to be more of a book that if you needed to teach yourself it would be helpful. It was a book full of much information, and lots of details. But for a class i would be hestiate on buying it. It was hard to wiz through the chapters, i seemed to fumble through the many pages in each chapter!! But i do have to say that is a very good tool information wise. Before deciding on this book check out; Fundamentals of Management (3rd addition)by Stephen Robbins and David Decenzo. Thanks-"
2,Becoming A Master Manager - Book Review,"I found that the book, Becoming A Master Manager, to not be very helpful in an Introduction to Management course. Although the idea behind this book is good and for the most part helpful, it is not adequate for the type of course I am currently taking. The idea of having each chapter focus on the different managerial roles is one that could potentially be very helpful. Since each section contains various compentencies that focus on different aspects of these roles, this book could be helpful for a course that was structured differently. However, since our class is structured toward the basic fundamentals of management, this book is somewhat useless. To be honest, I did not really look at this book extensively because I had another book that worked better for this class. I just felt it was not worth my time to continue with this book, since it did not help me in my studies."
1,Totally ineffective,"I installed these in every room of my apartment about two weeks ago, after seeing a mouse in my bedroom. Last night a mouse ran right through the living room, past 2 of the pestchasers and behind the tv. Then about 5 seconds later he ran RIGHT AT THE PESTCHASER and under the heater.These things seem like a great idea, but are totally unreliable. I only hope I can get my money back so I can buy some good old-fashioned, neck-snapping traps."
5,NO MORE MICE,We have these in our cottage. The place was full of mice when we bought it last year. We have not seen a single trace of a mouse since these were installed. I REALLY think they work!!!
3,A decent simulation,"Even though this game tries it's best to be realistic, it isn't all that fun. Graphics are nice, the music okay, but it's just too boring. Because of this, I would only recommend this to gamers looking for a simulation of the sport. More casual players should go try SSX."
3,SSX Beats ESPN X-Games...... BY FAR.......,"ESPN X-Games is overall a good game yet it does not even compare to the graphics and gameplay of SSX..... The graphics and gameplay in SSX are outstanding, you use every button on the controller to pull off stunts and earn points... If you like any type of skating game such as tony hawk pro skater get eithe rof these games...... You will not be dissappointed with ESPN, but you will have alot more fun with SSX"
2,"A mediocre game, at best","I had purchased this game right after renting SSX. I had hoped that since it had the ESPN license, that it would be just as good, it not better, than Electionric Art's game. But to my dismay, ""Winter X Games"" didn't provide 1/2 of the thrill that SSX did. The animation wasn't as good, the tracks weren't as breathtaking, and you went really slow. And if that wasn't bad enough, the game is incredibly hard. I've been practicing for a month and I still can't match the scores that the A.I. players get. When it comes down to the bottom line, I don't care how authentic a game is if I can't enjoy playing it. If you are looking for a snowboarding game, SSX is definitely your best choice."
2,i seen beter,"iv seen better snowboarding games i played it in toys""r""us the graphics are alright but i dont like the gameplay if you have nothing to do maybe you should get it but i think you should get SSX."
3,Great!!! But terrible,"This game is unbelievable. If you are looking for really good graphics to test your ps2 this is your game. But this game is also a dissapiontment. After you get three sponsers the game is basically over. If you want a great racing game buy ssx! I reccomend ssx because the game doesnt really end. Also, you can do tricks and earn pionts to open new tricks."
5,The best Snowboarding game ever!!!,"...Everything is so real unlike SSX (still a great game just unrealistic). In ESPN Winter X you can be pro riders like Peter Line, JP Walker and Tara Dakides. You can also make your own custom boarder and get filmed in movies to make money so you can buy boards, bindings, boots, jackets, pants, and goggles. It even has brands such as Volcom, Billabong, Forum and Four Square. The graphics are amazing and the controls are easy to remember and use. All in all ESPN Snowboarding is the best snowboarding game for the PS2."
1,SSX IS WAY BETTER......,"Unless you are a real snowboarder (which I am not) and into watching ESPN Winter X-Games 24-7 you will prob. think this game really sucks...for the money buy SSX Tricky, and thank me later...."
3,a mixed bag,"Take one young, emotionally wounded, privacy-loving computer science professor and put him in one side of a duplex. Take the struggling, widowed mother of a precocious toddler and put her in the other side. Add the considerable complications that she is taking a class from him, owns the duplex, is short on cash, and has a newly-developed fascination for home repair. Voila! Bachelor Blues! SPOILER: Cole's incredibly cynical attitude about women came mighty close to wrecking this story for me."
4,I don't care if they're,"I'm usually not one for rap, but I love Gym Class Heroes. They mix hip-hop with guitar and drums (and bass). They don't use repetitve drum loops, they don't sing about girls shaking their [...]. They sing from their heart about stuff that makes sense. So if I had to categorize them, I would consider them emo over rap."
1,[...],"""The Papercut Chronicles"" is quite possibly the WORST album to ever come out of Fueled By Ramen's indie label. I got tricked into buying this album based on a review from this website, which said (and I quote) ""Even if you're not into rap, suck it up, these guys are REAL musicians."" are you serious??? I was so rolling when I heard another reviewer comment that they got booed off stage, guess they've gone the way of nickelback in only one album. I'm sorry, but this ""band"" is a [...] to both the hip-hop industry (which is a terrible in and of itself) and the indie rock scene. Save your money and pick up the new Fallout Boy instead"
5,Captivating,"This is a wonderful and captivating novel that has bring Cambeira worldwide acclaim. This story is an intriguing and engrossing sequel; it is delicious and the best I've read in a long, long time. This book has all the elements of a great piece of literature. Doing research I found Cambeira's name and another of his books listed among Suggested Reading in a study guide for the Stage-Theatrical Version of Mario Vargas Llosa Novel 'La Fiesta del Chivo'(The Feast of the Goat).Congratulation to a promising author.This plot is readymade for a great movie.Azucar's Sweet Hope is a Must Read Book!"
5,"""Excellent - One of My Top 5 Books""","This is truly an Excellent, Superb and Marvelous Novel. Azucar's Sweet Hope...Her Story Continues by writer Alan Cambeira is filled with intelligent, strong and sensitive characters. This is powerfully written novel in a unique style that crosses linguistic and cultural barriers.This Excellent Novel in one of My Top 5 Books!Very Highly Recommended!"
5,Truly Remarkable,"This writer has a style of his own. He can give you love and at the same time he gives you terror. This story has action, suspense, and intrigue with complicated twists; in my opinion all the elements needed to make a great read.Highly Recommended Novel!"
3,Print quality,"The American Heritage High School Dictionary has an excelent format;however print quality leaves something to be desired. There are pages where the print is smudged and difficcult to read. The clearest, most concise, and easiest to understand definition is of no use if it cannot be read."
5,Good dictionary,This is a very good dictionary for high school. well organized and lots of useful information.
2,The Dairy State,California eclipsed Wisconsin as the nation's top milk producer. Wisconsion is number 1 in chesse production. Tells about the natives and European settlement with the fur trade.
4,Very delightful CD.,"This CD is a very good accompliment to Robert Schumann's piano book, Album For The Young. If you play the piano it is a brilliant help to know exactly how a piece sounds before you play it. The reason I took away one star was because the composer didn't stay to the composer's tempo in all the pieces"
5,Simply the best,Sanus stands and other products are the best. Beautiful to look and solid. THe ability to add weight to stabilize th stand is a plus.
4,Good for getting started in the genre,"Other reviewers have commented on inaccuracies between the written music and the tab - and these do exist. There are also a few wrong notes here and there (based on the chord accompaniment). Nevertheless, these are very minor points that are easily corrected by the performer. The value of this book is gaining familiarity with Irish/Scottish/Appalachian fiddle tunes arranged for mandolin. It is typical, when playing this music, to play it with many variations. Therefore, a basic outline is all that is appropriate, and a few printing errors here and there should not be a deal breaker. The other reason I give this 4 stars is that the paper quality and printing quality are suboptimal, but again, that's a small issue. I've really enjoyed learning this music, and have found this book valuable for doing so."
1,Worst Software I've bought in 22 years!!!!!!,"I have a HP Pavillion dv6000 running Windows Vista Home Premium. I was assured by the information accompanying the software that it would run on Microsoft Vists.When installation was completed, and the program started, the night sky had a large back and white trapezoid covering the lower half of the sky, with the demarkation between black and white being due south and each color extending for an azmuth angle of 45 degrees. When traversing to toward the west, a large black dome with a golden starburst covered the same lower part of the sky. When the time rate was accelerated, the moon appeared as a 'ghost' image and extended from the horizon to overhead and covered a full 90 degrees of the sky.I removed it from my comuter and re-installed it an additional four times. Nothing changed.Two emails and 3 telephone calls to the company remain unanswered.Bill McConnell"
1,May not work under Vista,Be very carefull when ordering any version of StarryNight Version 6.x. It may not work under Vista regardless of what is mentioned on the software compatibilities list. It does not work on my new Vista system.
1,Starry Night digital download,"With so many other people reporting that this WONDERFUL software won't run under Windows Vista I actually called their Tech Support before buying it.They assured me that if I had the latest Windows update etc. that it would run fine. It doesn't. It is the only program I have ever tried on the less than 12 month old machine which give a blue screen and then shuts down. Like in the bad old days with Windows first started.I am sorry, I used to have this Starry Night on an XP machine and I loved it. But if you are running Windows Vista, save yourself some grief. Don't waste your money."
3,Clunky interface,"I got this program hoping that it would help me better learn the sky and help me locate deep space objects. It does that adequately, albeit through a clunky interface with non-intuitive menus and glitchy navigation. It works but it takes some working to get it to do what you want.It has an event feature that lets you know what is going on the sky which I use. I use it to predict viewing times of planets and helping visually identify galaxies and nebula. Overall, I'm glad I have it I just wish that it had been laid out a little better for the price."
3,Disappointing for the price,"My biggest disappointment is with some of the rather low quality images for deep sky objects. The Orion nebulae, one of the more beautiful objects in the sky, appears to be three or four low resolution images stacked up on top of one another giving it a chunky perspective. I've been adding some of my own images by replacing files in the program directory, but this is not a fully supported feature unless you shell out $149 for the Pro Version. For the $79 I paid, plus $10 shipping, I definitely expected more. SkySafari Pro - for $39 on my IPAD - is a far superior looking product. For $79 dollars I expected much more professional graphics that seamlessly integrate into the sky. You don't get this with Starry Night Enthusiast."
5,Angela's Review- 5 stars,This book is a very easy to read and has really great monologues. I hope Karshner comes out with another book.
4,Just a bit confused,"The manual says that the filter needs to be set to ""on"" if your receiver doesn't have frequency control for the sub. My Yamaha receiver automatically outputs all frequencies below 150Hz to the sub but there is no control. So I set the filter to ""on"". However, the sub did not work in this mode although my frequency setting was all the way to 120Hz on the sub. Had to turn the filter off for the sub to work i.e. red light became green. Anyone have that experience?"
5,Dubalicous Video,This is a great video of a Killer version of the Dark Side. These guys do a fantastic job and sound awesome! I would recommend this video to any Floyd fan! Especially if you like reggae! Super Great!
4,"decent, I thought it was a history not an 'eyewitness' read","I thought this book was going to be a blow by blow history of the IAF. Unfortunatly much of it is the authors recollections. Now this does not discount the books greatness. The story is one of heroism and triumph over great odds. The Israelis built one of the best air forces int he world. An air force that able to defeat the arabs many times and proved in one on one combat to be far superior. Some detractors say this was simply because the 'American' weapon system was better, thats like a workmen blaming his tools, which is typical of the arab mindset, if they lose they always blame some plot that brought them failure, instead of crediting their opponents resolutness. Furthermore the Israeli air force was able to slip into entebbe and rescue Jewish hostages, something the americans failed to do in 1979 in the Desert One failure. On top of this the Israelis were able to airlift tens of thousands of jews from Iraq, Ethiopia and the Yemen."
2,Good but broke down quickly,"The television worked well when it worked. Unfortunately, only fourteen months after purchase, the television broke and now we're faced with no TV or a $500 repair bill. Toshiba only warranties this set for a year, and we are two months outside of that. The set is far too expensive to break down so quickly, and is very expensive to repair.Purchase with caution!"
4,Message to the Future,"Of an Armenian descent mostly ""System of a Down"" US-band shares its pain related to an Armenian massacre in Turkey, bridging this en masse annihilation with Jewish Holocaust and genocide in the Balkans and Africa recently."
4,Full Of Cute Characters,"Rugrats isnt a game that i would usually play, but a friend had bought it so i thought that i would give it a go. The game is based on the film of the same title with our hero having to battle through 16 levels to find his new mommy. There are plenty of bonus levels throughout the game to keep gamers happy. Although i think this game was aimed towards the younger end of the market i feel that all ages will like it although they wont admit ti it."
1,bad bad bad game: don't waste your hard earned money!,"Controls: horrible- it takes me 5 minutes to walk 5 inches, and 20 minutes to make a 90 degree turnGraphics: ok, but definitely could have been betterGameplay: noneBosses: what? only one boss?Story: what story? ohhh.... that story.... ;)Ok, I think you get the picture. This game is horrible. Definitely not worth 5 bucks. Or 5 minutes. The whole game is mini games. No, stop laughing, that was no joke! This game would have been saved by even being a racing game! It baffles me to think it even phsycally possible to make a game this awful. In other words, stay away from this game!!!!"
1,Nice game? no more like 0 stars,I gave this to my kids because I thought it would be like the show! But no! no no no! It's not even a little educational! I on't think carnivals are educational! Man they could just be smokin pot! As a matter of fact I caught Chuckie beatin up people! iN THAT GAME OF HIS! I hated it! Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Rugrats In Paris,This game is okay but the movement is slow. In this game you cant roll run or jump. You have to collect the tickets and buy things like a reptar doll. It doesnt even help you so you shouldnt wast your tickets. Anyway the graphics arent that good and the their faces are weird. The games I reccomend are Diddy Kong Racing and Zelda.
5,"Finally - a ""practical"" book for ""all"" women!","I love this book because there is something in it for everyone--single or married women of all ages, with or without kids. I'm married without kids, but my life can get ""frantic"" at times, too, and there's so much in this book that I can put to use in my everyday life. The checklists are great because I'm a checklist kind of person. The ""Hidden gems"" are little practical tips that come in so handy. But I think what I like most about it are the month-by-month reminders--so many ideas that I've never thought of before that I can't wait to try out this year!"
5,Nice Marine Case,I just wish I hadn't accidentally hit the unlock button as I jumped into the water. My previous pictures were still ok on the disk but the camera was fried.
2,Pretend the 2 means 2.5--Not a DVD worth buying,"You might be looking at the card and thinking (wow this is pretty sweet maybe I should buy it or Netflix it) But I'd advise against it. As neat as it is that the PPV features the UFC debuts of Rampage and CroCop, neither fight is entertaining. Quinton's was especially disappointing as the first round was seen by many as rather boring. Before the finish actually it all was pretty unentertaining. In CroCop's case, he was booked purposefully against a less skilled fighter to get him over with the audience unfamiliar with him. Well he destroys the guy, but it's not as fun as some of his other one sided beat downs.For the rest of the card, Lyoto and Cote both have boring fights while the main event is decided in a non-title fight with a contender who's overweight and already gassed. Though it is interesting how close he is to finishing Silva. His exhaustion point cost him dearly though. Skip this one."
3,Not my favorite translation,"I'm comparing Wu's translation as I work my way through Ellen Chen's translation and commentary and find Chen's ""better,"" at least for me. Of course, Wu's translation is from 1961 and provided without commentary, and Chen's work is from 1989, after the discovery of the Ma-wang Tui texts in 1973, so she had more to work material to work with. Her commentary adds so much to the reader's understanding of the text."
5,Peaceful and sweet,A good read when you want to quiet your mind. It certainly takes you to another world and it envisions how a real man should be. Quite christian in many ways.
2,Horrible!,"People, don't buy this game...it sucks!!! I love ESPN but their videogames .... Let me tell you some of the flaws in this game...no speed burst, you have to hold an extra button just to pump fake a shot (most games you need just to tap the shoot action button), and the colors are too dark. The default control is placed in a way where it's difficult to learn the game. The only plus to this game is that it has pretty good graphics. Don't waste your money buying this game. Sorry, ESPN."
2,"""This game is a joke""",This game is terrible. The graphics are just horrible. It is one of the most unrealistic BasketBall games I have ever played. This game makes all BasketBall games look bad. ...
1,terrible,"this game was unbelievably bad. i just got nba live 2001 and there is no comparison. nba 2 night was horrible. the graphics were awful, the gameplay was even worse. there are several bugs which are really really annoying. the only decent feature was the create a player option which was much more detailed that nba live 2001. honestly, nba live 2000 for playstation 1 was much much better than nba 2 night."
1,Don't waste your money,"This game to sum up in just a couple of word: ""Don't waste your money!"" I have no idea how these other people gave it a good review, this is the worst basketball game, wait.... worst sports game, wait....worst game I have ever played. There are only 4 different kinds of moves that you can use, PS1 and Sega had more moves with less buttons than this game. It is probably the hardest game to navigate around, and you can't even tell what you are trying to do in this game. The game play is horrible, the graphics are horrible, I can't find one thing I like about this game. If you want to spend $50+ for a good basketball game, but an old Sega and play some of there's. I thought PS2 would attempt to have some decent games, but this is horrible."
2,"Not really Malian, not really Amadou and Mariam","Be forewarned: if you want to learn more about Malian music and listen to amazing duo Amadou and Mariam, look elsewhere! This is not really their music. I enjoy the music of Manu Chau, and I love Amadou and Mariam. However, I wish I had bought another one of their albums (such as Welcome to Mali) instead of this one, which I find to be overly influenced by Chau and his repetitive music. A few of the songs are okay , but as an album it doesn't sound much like Amadou and Mariam, lacks their joyful music and singing, and gives over entirely to nasal Chau who seems to sound the same on every song."
1,Don't even rent it,I bought this game because of these reviews and all I can say is too many [people] reviewed the arcade game and not the PS2 game. The Arcade game is great. Worthless controls makes this one not even worth renting. The game is average to dull until the first time you end up in a helicoptor at which point the controls simply leave you helpless. In the arcade the same scene meant a challenging headshot that made you feel like you could work for the CIA if you made it. On the PS2 it's a frustrating attempt to push too many buttons and still not be able to move your scope quickly or accurately enough in sniper mode. When you finally make the shot it makes you feel like you're justified in throwing the disk out the window. ....
2,DISAPPOINTED VERY MUCH,This game is not very exciting except when you blow up the semi. It lacks gore and blood. Tooooooooooo easy. I can beat the whole game in 15 minutes.
1,MAKE SURE YOU RENT FIRST,"Following my own advice I rented this game first before buying it. The game being a 5-day rental, I only kept it for a day. After 20 minutes the game becomes very, very, boring. I know this has been said many times before, but this game should have been left in the arcade."
1,Frustrating,"I'm not a gamer really, but I do watch my friends play alot. My boyfriend bought his PS2 and the first game we rented was Silent Scope. I suppose I'm just not fast enough or coordinated enough to move my scope around and still shoot accurately. That darn scope is the problem...it is hard to put the sniper in the target and still shoot him before he moves. My guy beat this game in one day...he had to take a couple of breaks to let some steam out hitting his golf clubs. I have been told the arcade game is way more enjoyable. I find the ""Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes it out"" to be the most enjoyable game so far...it's even one that chicks like me might enjoy..."
3,The fun doesn't last...,"The graphics are definitely awesome and the strategic choices abound, but the more I play this game, the more I wish I had a gun-type controller in my hands. Also, in a possible departure from the arcade game, the story mode could use more long-term progression using memory cards. Still, it's a good break from playing SSX and NHL 2001 all day."
1,Great game! Awful on console!,"Since Silent Scope 2 was out in the arcades and if there are two arcade machines of Silent Scope 2, you would be able to play with your buddies or even duel with them.Now with Konami's release of Silent Scope for DC and PS2, it was perhaps the biggest let down from Konami's game. Dont get me wrong... Metal Gear Solid was the greatest and still the greatest game! Even using the PSG1 was more fun than playing silent scope.If you really liked the arcade versions of Silent Scope and Dark Sillowette, the console versions would just be a little let down since you cant use the large sniper gun. (although it would be a novelty to have!!)My reason for only one star is the bad transition from Arcade to Console."
2,DONT BUY,"I got this game with my ... pal ps2 and it .... its cool at first (but only with a mouse, the joystick settings are terrible) but it gets boring, and it doesnt give you the arcade feeling of the cool sniper gun. the only thing that keeps me playing it are the cool secret modes for expert snipers (available in the official website)"
2,"Johnny, Get Your Gun",This would be an EXCELLENT game if they'd managed to ship a light gun with a scope on it with the product.Instead...I think it's best played at the arcade.
1,Junk,"Pure junk. I played the game for 10 mins. Wish I could seal it back up and return it. I'd rather be playing astroids on Atari. Speaking of old systems, the graphics on this junk is similar to the old Nintendo. This junk has no business embarassing Playstation 2. I wouldn't even recommend renting it, it isn't worth the 5 bucks."
2,So so game that gets boring fast,"Silent Scope is a good port of the arcade game, but lacks the thing that made Silent Scope so fun, the gun. This aside the graphics aren't very good (even for a launch title) in the Story mode. The sound should be turned off or replaced by a CD of your choice. All this wouldn't matter is the ""FUN"" was there. but it's not. It's difficult to target moving objects with the analog stick and the control pad is too jumpy. The stick doesn't let you move the scope fast enough when you get to the bosses. There are too many enemies to deal with. It gets frustrating. The training mode is more fun to me than the story mode. If you like shooting games rent it, but if you're looking for an introduction to the genre I'd choose another."
1,where's the zapper gun????,"Silent Scope cannot be played using a control pad. The ""scope"" moves so slowly, and it is rather frustrating to look for enemies while being shot sixty million times because it takes twelve years to move the gun scope around to find targets. A good PS2 zapper, if included, would make this game 4 or even 5 stars. The graphics are crisp and clear, the sound is good, but none of that matters when your game is over in ten seconds because you can't look around fast enough."
3,well i really dont know about this....,dont get me wrong this game is great but it is so liitle and you can beat it in less than thirty minutes if you are playing it for the firs time. i played this game in the arcade and it was my favorite game for a long long time. when i saw that it was coming out for ps2 i perorderd it right away. when i took it ome i was thinking i got a big long lasting game. well it ended up i beat the game in about thirty minutes. this game is completly the same from the arcade. ig you want a good shooting game i would suggest to get unreal tournament or time splitters.
2,It is an ok game.,"Its an all right game. I bought it because I thought I played it in the arcade. It was really fun in the arcade, but it happened to be a way different game. I can't get passed the last level, it is VERY hard. I always run out of time. But, I am not the best. For skilled gamers only. THAT MEANS NOT ME! hehe."
1,Silent Scope,"When I played this game in the arcade, I really got a kick out of it. When I first got my PS2, this was one of my first games. Actually it was the first I played. The game is very disappointing. First of all, unlike the gun feature at the arcade, using the joystick makes scoping in on targets difficult at best. This is even more true when shooting at bosses. The sound was nothing special. The graphics were ok. These short-falls in the game would have been ok if the gameplay was there. So, if I could go back in time, I'd rent it and never rent it again. The only good thing I can say about this game is that it is worth 18 bucks for trade-in on another title."
3,Nice coffee table book,"I found this book to be interesting, but not in-depth enough for intermediate astronomers. The information on the planets is overly simplistic and for entertainment purposes. For example, instead of having a graph of basic information for every planet, sometimes it lists essential information (like orbital period) and sometimes it doesn't which makes it useless as a reference.I suggest it for the younger prospective amateur, but for older users get the Peterson's Field Guide: Stars and Planets. Very sturdy build and good guide for charting the planets."
5,Astronomy handbook,"If you want to know what's up in the skies, this is the book for you. Learn all about the planets and stars and when and where to look for them."
5,This man has the vocals,"I love this CD of David Phelps. I actually think I may enjoy it more than his newer music. Not that his voice hasn't ""grown"" but that his voice on this CD is more down to earth. On this CD he doesn't try hitting high notes on every song it's more ""easy listening""."
3,Just not the same...,"We so enjoyed David when he sang with the Gaither vocal Band and became ardent fans. When I ordered this CD it was to try it out as several people in their evaluations said they were a little disappointed. We do not enjoy the more modern gospel music. We were also disappointed in this album because it no longer shows David in his best light. He's just a better performer than this CD shows. David, wish you were still with the band."
1,disappointing,"A while back, my brother was looking at this CD to buy for my mother's birthday and left it on the shelf. I questioned his reasoning at first, but after listening I would have done the same. Don't get me wrong. David Phelps has always been the singer that I have strived be, but I could hardly make it through the sample sound clips. After hearing Revelation, I was impressed at how he put his own spin on rather contemporary sounding songs, but he still had a rather classical sounding voice. He has lost the classical sound and has gone on to a more pop/mainstream sound. David, we love songs like ""Live like a King"" and ""No more Night"". Come back to the Gaither Vocal Band."
1,I want the old David back!,"The first album I bought of his was the self-titled album, and I absolutely hated it. I've heard him with the Gaithers doing some of the most beautiful singing I've ever heard - I mean thrilling, I mean chill bumps!! Now, on the aforementioned album and this one, he sounds like everybody else - trying to be a Christian rock singer. I want the old David back!!!!"
5,"Where there's gold, I'm a-goin","This is a great book! My 6 year old recieved his book in May of 2002 and he knows this book by heart. My son is very involved with pirates and this hits the spot with great adventure that any 6 year old would enjoy. We need more great pirate books, with great illustration from Doug and Kim Kennedy. Highly recommend this book!!"
5,A humorous picturebook about a pirate and his parrot,"Pirate Pete is the engaging, humorous picturebook about a pirate and his parrot determined to plunder golden treasure. Yet one disaster after another befalls them on their journey, and a surprise is waiting in store at the end! A simple and delightful story by Kim Kennedy, Pirate Pete features Doug Kennedy's vividly colorful and jaunty artwork. Recommended for family, school, and public library children's picturebook collections."
4,Inspiring,"Yup, you heard me:Inspiring. I based an entire one week/half day summer camp off of this book. I loved the idea of being a pirate and visiting different islands looking for gold even though the X wasn't on those islands. I loved that the candy islanders took good care of their teeth. We came up with games for each island, craft and snack to accompany it and the kids were entertained all week based off this story. The only thing I did NOT like about it is the ""Gleaming Booty"" I knew I could not read this to my class of 3-5 year olds without them missing the point. I also didn't like that the pirate at the beginning of the story STOLE the map from the queen and that at the end of the story he didn't learn his lesson. But theres a lot to be said for the creativity, the illustration of the maps, the ideas and wording...it inspired me to do an entire camp based on it."
3,wordy for intended audience,"My 3 year old daughter loved the pictures, but it drags out the story so much that I have to abreviate it. My 6 year old son never enjoyed it."
5,biolage ultra hydrating balm,I absolutely LOVE this product. Great for dry hair when nothing else works this is the product to get I have curly hair that gets matted and this balm really gets the mattes out and makes my hair silky without losing my curl. Gives extra moisture to dry brittle hair Really worth the price. I couldn't go a day without it I recommend this to anyone with really dry hair no other product compares
2,Eightball Issue #22,"If you are just getting into Dan Clowes and graphic novels in general and prefer a book to go with your Jimmy Corrigan and Blankets on your bookshelf-shell out the extra money. Otherwise go and support your local indie book/comic store and buy issue 22 for a hell of a lot cheaper. I'm so glad I rented this book from the library before buying it to realise I had read it all before! Absolutely disgusted by money grubbing publishers. Oh, about the story-its good, but definitely not at the top of his game-check out velvet glove, ghost world, hell, even Dan Pussay!"
2,Is there a story here?,"I read a lot of graphic novels and enjoy the majority of them, but some just don't make a lot of sense. This, for me, is one of the latter. I know, I know -- Clowes is one of the stars of the genre, and I actually very much enjoyed the award-winning _Ghost World,_ but this one isn't in that league at all. In structure, it's a series of very brief, semi-connected vignettes centered on a variety of residents of the town of Ice Haven, most of them teenage or younger. (I gather this is also just a slightly rewritten remake of the original comic book.) The interrelationships are unclear, the motivations are puzzling, and the dialogues and monologues are mostly overwritten. I guess even award-winners have bad days."
1,Second-rate Madonna clone ............,"Sounds like she was recorded in an under-equipped home studio. She can sing, but the material is formulaic and trite."
4,brightly variously magnetically,"beautiful toy for little fashionistas.two magnetic dolls and miniature clothes for them.I played a half-hour, 3 year old daughter is still not very interested. may be later.I think that is a good gift in a colorful package for girls 5-7 years."
5,Nice toy,"This is so cute. I got it for my granddaughter who just turned two. She was not really into it because she's not been exposed to paper dolls, etc. I think as she gets a little older it will be so much fun for her. All the items are durable and they go on and off so easily. The only drawback is the carrying case is not real secure, sturdy, etc. Once she starts playing more with it, it will probably tear. I have suggested to the Momma for us to get another type of bag or container to hold all the items so they do not get lost. It's a real cute toy. I think on the toy it says ages 3 and up. So if the little girl is around 3 they should love it."
3,"Small, but user interface is difficult","This metronome is very small -- slightly larger than a credit card, and just a quarter inch thick or so. This makes it handy for use on the road, but there are tradeoffs. First, the maximum volume is not all that loud. Second, because of the size, there are only four buttons on the unit, and the user interface thus has to do the rest: if you want to adjust the volume, for example, there is no simple ""volume"" knob or button. You have to use the ""select"" button and cycle through the various options, and then decrease/increase volume.For regular home use, then, this is not the ideal unit, in my estimation. I'd prefer something that is more quickly/easily adjustable, and louder."
2,Flimsy fold-out stand,"I had this product for 2 days when the flimsy fold-out stand on the rear of the item, none too secure to begin with, failed completely to stay in position. The other beef I have is that the single all-functions select button forces one to step past an annoyingly loud pitch function. The design would be improved if a dedicated pitch button was available."
4,fine,"it's a very small metronome, easy to carry, works absolutely fine. The only problem that some people may show the concern is the volume, if your working with more than 2 instrumentalists, you probably cant hear the metronome. But it works perfect for the solo :)"
1,Seiko DM70,Don't waste your money on this item. Very cheap unit. Volume does not go high enough to hear the beats.
4,Bear armguard,"My grandson Has'nt used it yet,but I inspectd it and It looks well made.Happy wit purchase. same for te Ridge mt.arrow holster."
3,good coverage,it works great for my little sister but if your a bigger adult hand wise definitely look into some other products
3,Armguard,I purchased this for my 13 year old grandson. it is about the correct size for him as he is of a smaller stature. I would not recomend it for anyone much bigger than he is especially not big enough for an adult.
4,Nice size,"I like the size and feel , it's a great addition to my archery stuff. I most like the adjustable size"
3,Doesn't look like the picture.,"I ordered this for my teenage son. It's kind of small and it doesn't look like the picture. It's all black, and it appears to be very small. I wish that it were brown like the one that is pictured for the product. The one pictured looks to have more of a durable appearance, and sort of a ""leatherish"" quality. The black one has no product information on the bag, and it certainly doesn't have the same appearance."
4,Serves it's purpose,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter to go along with all her other archery things. It's not bulky so it won't get in the way, and it fits well. Good useful product."
1,Cheap. Junk.,"I didn't even bother to open the package. One look, and it went right to the trash.Super cheap. This thing wouldn't protect your arm from a mild wind gust.I blame myself though, should have spent more $$$ for a better product."
3,Strap wasn't too nice.,"The strap is flimsy and turns the armguard into a weird shape when you tighten it. The straps are also connected to one another by velcro, which adds to the flimsiness. It did, however, do it's job. It was cheap and it worked, so three stars."
4,Reasonable,"The arm guard is a little short and the loops that hold it to your arm aren't adjustable enough to make it a tight fit on my arm, but with a little modification it works just fine and, considering the price, seems to be a good value. Lets see how well it holds up in the future."
3,Functional,"It definitely does its job, but its very very small.I didnt necessarily believe it to be too small for my arm, as I am a fairly small woman... But this is obviously made for a child.The side that touches your skin does get scratchy, so I do wear a longsleeved shirt under it.Also, the straps seem very flimsy which can make it difficult to attach. I also fear when they will give out.Worth the price I guess, but I dont necessarily recommend it."
4,"Pretty nice intro armguard for archery, SIZE UP",it's what the title of my review suggests.A nice cheap alternative or spare to have when going out for a good shoot. I liked it and it got the job done.My only advice would be to get the large as it will surely cover all of your arm. The small may...be too small and you hurt yourself.Will look for future items in this category.
2,Ships black and fell apart before first use,Purchased this for my daughter. Was surprised to see it show up as black and not brown.Took her out for her first archery lesson and the thing fell apart as I was putting it on her arm. Turns out there are cheap little metal clamps that prevent the straps from coming undone. Fortunately I was able to find it on the ground and clap it down properly with some tools.
1,Bad item,"Purchased this to saved about $4.00, big mistake...the Velcro to fasten the other part of the other Velcro is very cheap and it will rip easily after a couple of uses...this brand is not good quality and I would not recommend anyone to buy this.. I went at my local sport store after I purchased this and the one at my local store cost $10.00 but it's a much better item that can last 20 times more."
3,functional,"If you plan to use it more than once and are older than 10 you should get a better one. Real armguards start around 15 bucks and don't annoy you or need to be adjusted every time you bend your arm. A sock with the toes cut off work better than all these cheap arm guards, and are just as stylish..."
4,Good armguard,"This is a well made product and it does the job. However, it is not that comfortable. It has rough edges that dig in to my arm a little. I would say I have average sized forearms and it fits me okay."
2,Broken Already,I gave this arm guard to my son on a Friday night. We shot for a while then quit. The next day he shot most of the morning. Then some of his friends came over and they shot. By late afternoon all the stiching had come loose from the elastic straps so the guard could not be worn. Rather than return it we stitched it back together. The design it good because it can fit tiny arms like my son if the straps are crisscrossed or large arms with the straps straight around. The materials are good quality. The construction is the weak point. Lots of the stiching did not line up so you had stiching that did not actually attach anything. That is a big mistake.
1,Ouch!!,"If you are a small person this might be a good arm guard, however as an average sized person, this is too small and has resulted in two bad scrapes both times I used it. Buy a larger guard. Construction is good, size is bad."
2,Okay,"I kind of liked it better back when I made my own guard out of duct tape. The straps are elastic and they don't really hold the guard in place very well without them being really tight. And even without them being really tight, it's uncomfortable to wear."
3,Mediocre read,"Nice because of the familiarity with the Old Forge and Adirondack region. Characters do a lot of eating, especially breakfast and you can get all the details of crispy bacon and green tea over and over and over again at the same establishments over and over again."
4,not the full sized version,Didn't realize this is a small bible. I would have preferred the larger one. But it's ok.
2,Great illustrations but...,"The illustrations in this and other Usborne books are great. However, I didn't think a very good or accurate translation for children. As a born-again Christian parent, I want a bible that is age-appropriate AND very accurate for my kids."
5,Usborne Bible,I gave one to each of my students making First Communion and they are in awe as we read stories and talk about God and the meanings of the stories. Great book!
5,Augusta GA reader,"I began this book with skepticism; I finished it with admiration and awe. Susan Mucha did a marvelous job with this novel. I couldn't wait to read each new chapter, breaking my own rule of one chapter a night. I can't wait for the next novel, and expect it to be as good as this one."
5,Ranks with the Best!,"Deadly Deception is a great mystery novel, a real page turner, by first novelist, Susan P. Mucha. Compelling and intriguing from start to finish, her characters are well developed and real and the plot with it's twists and turns keeps you eagerly engaged to the conclusion. Mrs. Mucha ranks right up there with some of the best female mystery writers of our time and I look forward to her next novel with great anticipation!"
4,Nice read,"I was anxious to read this book b/c I knew Susan Mucha while we're all at Medical College of Georgia. This was an enjoyable read and I would recommend this as a good ""beach read"". Several character were""suspect"" so trying to discern who was perpetrating the deception and who was ""on the up and up"" was fun! Looking forward to reading Susan's other novels!!!"
3,Not What I Expected,The foam on the Hollywood Pink Foam Rollers was very thin. The clasp was difficult to snap closed.I think they are going to wear out in a very short time.
2,Hard to open and close,"The size and foam is okay, but the plastic fastener is so stiff that you need two hands to get them opened and closed and that makes them difficult to use. These are not like the ones I remember using when I was a kid."
5,Maybrick goes to the top of the list!,"For me, this book was a long-awaited follow-up to the original ""Diary of Jack the Ripper"". It may not quite live up to the promise made in the title of being the ""final chapter"", but it should move Maybrick to the top of the list of those suspected of being Jack the Ripper."
1,Preaching to the choir,"Not being a Ripper enthusiast, I had a very hard time plowing through this book. There's evidently a lot of good research behind it, but it's hidden beneath the taunting of the Diary doubters. The whole tone seems to be to whip up the folks who already agree with him. Folks who believe the Diary is a hoax won't be persuaded by this book, and people like me who have no prior knowledge of the controversy aren't likely to be convinced by Feldman's ranting."
2,Definitively not the final chapter,"Paul Feldman certainly works hard to prove his thesis that Liverpool merchant James Maybrick wrote the infamous Diary and that this gentleman was the Whitechapel Murderer. Regrettably, the author's style and methodology leave a great deal to be desired. The writing is poorly directed and tilts at the wrong targets. Much of the argument is facile and lacks credibility. Some of the theorising is interesting, but overall there are so many red herrings that the theory has no credibility. Written in the 'train of events' style beloved of many novice writers, the book is unpleasant to read and not a little insulting in places. Ideal as a primer on how not to write a true crime book."
4,UnRetro Disco,"This one is way more upbeat than ""Cloud Nine"". And as a result it's somewhat discoish but not too nostolgic. That said, this is a fine package, that in my opinion has only one negligable track. Highly recommended.Note: The -1 star is strictly a measure of personal preferance, I prefer a more chilled vibe as is found on Cielo: Cloud Nine."
4,A WELCOME PRESENT FOR DADS AND GRADS,"Long appreciated for his women's wear designs Shanghai born Alfred Sung introduced his first fragrance in 1986, ""Sung, Alfred Sung."" Since then he has offered several popular scents, among them are ""Forever,"" ""Pure,"" and ""Shi.""Once he turned his attention to men's fragrances he enjoyed the same success, beginning with ""Sung Homme"" in 1988. ""Hei,"" his latest scent for men is also sure to please with its green, fresh fragrance underscored by spices, woods and musks. Nature augments the fragrance with notes of Fennel, Neroli, Jasmine, Lavender, and Cardamon. There's even a hint of spearmint.The bottle is pure Sung, a water drop in a rich blue tone capped by a darkened metallic round. On the top panel of the blue box is found the Chinese symbol for energy, an appropriate description of this scent."
5,Excellent performances of music by Yoshimatsu,"Nobuya Sugawa is an amazing saxophonist and really plays the Cyberbird Concerto well. His artistry is complete in both technique and interpretation, and this piece is certainly a challenge for any saxophonist. The Symphony #3 is darker in mood compared to the Concerto, but is still moving and played very well by this BBC Orchestra. Yoshimatsu's style of composition is very accessible to a wide range of listeners without a diminishment in quality. He is very inventive in how he uses sound, and I highly recommend any of his music."
5,BEAUTIFUL,The picture shown tells it all. It is very pretty and looks nice on the cage with the beautiful bird on front. Washes up and looks brand new each time. No wrinkles. Highly recommended.Now if I could get my bird to appreciate it. He barks like a dog each night when I cover him. I can open the slits on the side and talk to him for a few seconds and then he quiets down.Just like a kid--wants to stay up and party all night long.
3,"Rach's 1,2,3","Handy, and useful at a bargain price, this set proves disappointing, especially with so many great individual performances, as well as 3 symphony sets. Ormandy's old Columbia/Sony set still rules, but don't miss Stokie's Rach Symphony #3, which he recorded in his 90's. It sizzles like none other."
3,Disappointing,"I actually prefer their first book, which at least had loads of very useful tips. I completely agree with Cultured Purl. There are a couple of cuite things here, but except for a cropped sweater which is called a shrug for some wierd reason, most of them really need the yarn specified. Can't see them coming out quite the same with subs.Take a look at Teva Durham's new book - loop d loop. I just received it and am crazy about it. Over 40 patterns, and gorgeous to boot. I have a huge collection of knitting books, and this is the only one I wouldn't part with. HIGLY recommended."
2,Not for patterns,"I bought this book thinking it might give me simple ideas of things to knit. It would be great for someone who wants to learn, not someone that already knows how."
1,Very uncomfortable,You can't wear these for very long without your ears getting sore. If you don't have them in far enough to be uncomfortable then the sound quality isn't any good.
5,Rock Solid Card!,"This was a solid UFC card all the way around. The fighters were well-matched against each other, with some surprising results. Griffin vs. Jardine was an explosive, albeit relatively short fight; and Leben vs. MacDonald showed how persistance and tenacity pay off.I admit that I was just as interested in seeing the UFC debut of England's Michael Bisping (following his winning The Ultimate Fighter 3) as I was in watching Liddell and Ortiz come to blows again. Suffice it to say, neither fight disappoints. With the exception of Arlovski and Cruz, there wasn't a fight on this card that I was disappointed in. Highly recommended!"
5,Needed Resource for the Industry,"As a 10 year industry veteran, I was very impressed by the overall scope and depth that this book provides for wireless marketing. It is a must read for those entering the industry as well for those of us who wants an up to date perspective on the shifting paradigms of wireless marketing and distribution."
3,"""Great surface material""","I've owned this book for some time now, and judging by the cover and title, you would think this book offers the complete plan for turning someone with low self-confidence to a totally confident individual. Wrong. This book covers topics such as; ""How To Tell a Story"", ""How To Give A Talk"", etc.. Sure, these are important attributes, but...The last of the 7 steps was, ""Smile"", yet he gave no advice on the subject. Mr. Anderson is a wonderful writer, and yes, the steps he gives will further ones level of confidence, but there are better books. I was looking through my collection of self-confidence books, and I came across a great one. ""I Dare You"". Now read that one. This one is missing a lot. Read it anyway."
4,Comments on what individuals can do rather than causes,"Anderson, editor of Parade magazine, offers advice to help people become more confident, win friends, and influence people. His tips include taking responsibility for your behavior, ""doing"" versus ""trying,"" and acting in spite of fear. The book does not address the lack of confidence in the workplace felt by many people today due to the effects of incessant change."
5,Horse Race Game,"I am not one who plays many games, but this one is a lot of fun. We played on Christmas Day for small wagers. We played again on New Years. It is a great game. I have a Grandson that want to play this.Fun Fun"
1,"Internal Leaks, Sealant Came Off","I bought this at an Outdoor shop at a national park, where there was no choice. While it appeared well made and didn't leak after I adjusted the cap, there was some kind of black sealant inside on the weld seam. I have only put hot green tea (no sugar) in the bottle, nothing corrosive. Yet after washing it in hot water and Dawn detergent, and using a softBottle Brush, the sealant came off. Now the bottle has internal leaks and plain hot water will pour out brown after a couple of hours.There apparently is no warranty on this product, and writing and emailing to many of the US distributors and the European headquarters have produced nothing in 3 months. I have replaced this with aZojirushi SJ-SDE10 Tuff Sports Stainless Steel Vacuum Bottle(may still have wrong product image on link) and couldn't be happier. The Zojirushi keeps my tea hotter longer and has a 5 year warranty if I need it."
1,Not what it seems,"I ordered this product because of the Sigg brand reputation, but was very disappointed when it arrived. First and most minor, I ordered the Black Anthracite which turned out to be grey. More importantly was the design of the item - for a thermos it is very large. The lid which is supposed to turn and pour, I was never able to secure properly and shut all the way. Lastly, I believed the item to be ""swiss made"" and actually it was made in china. I gave up and for the first time ever, returned an item to amazon."
3,"keeps things cold, but loses its functionality","At the end of 12-13 hours, there are still ice cubes rattling around in my thermos, which is amazing. However, I used to be able to press the button on the inner cap, enabling me to pour liquid without removing that cap. This has since stopped working and now the inner cap retains water whenever I wash it. The thermos also spilled all over my car trunk recently, which was unfortunate. I am now in search of a new thermos or else will endeavor to keep this one upright at all times."
5,Pretty Good . . .,"This CD-set was overall pretty good! It's kind of like an imitation WOW except with not as good song selection. The booklet is also very small with no pictures like WOW has. It only lists all the songs, artists, year/album it's from, etc. Actually I shouldn't complain that much because it DOES have my absolute favorite song ever that's not on any WOW - All About You by Nate Sallie. I also like Hero by Superchic[k]. So it's a good CD, but if you want a really good ""various artist"" 2-disc CD set - I would rather recommend getting a WOW (WOW 2005 is the best one), but you should still get this one once you're done collecting the WOWs! It's fun to listen to, and it's a nice set! :-D"
3,Perfect color!,"When ordering online, sometimes the colors are not the same when they arrive, but this was truly represented and it matched the bathing suit I bought perfectly."
1,Yuck!,I ordered this item thinking it looked nice in the picture. The actual item is cheap looking and the color isn't at all like what is shown in the picture. The color I got was dirty looking and much more greenish. The quality wasn't good at all. I know it was cheap in price so I shouldn't have expected much. But it's not worth the money to buy. I had to pay to shipping to get it and now shipping to return it. Not worth it! I would highly suggest NOT wasting your money on this product. Very disappointed.
4,Easy to follow for children,"This is a fun book to keep the kids busy and have fun with them. It has easy steps to follow and the kids learned a lot about circles and shapes, and coloring."
5,simple instruction great results,"From the day my 5 year old daughter got hold of this book and ""I can draw people"" she is stuck with these. She completed 4 drawings at one sitting and always wants to do more. The best part is the simple visual instruction that shows the way without any adult supervision. Great book!"
5,exactly what I was looking for,perfect for my niece who is 6 years old. She is able to draw the pictures and there are no directions to read. highly recommended
2,Don't bother...,"This book has very little real content and is not well written (no real surprise on either). You can read much better stuff on the ""woo woo"" aspects of Sedona on the Internet."
5,Best live cd in a while,"This live 2 disc set is what Frisell & Co. are all about live. What they can do with even the simplest, seemingly nothing song is amazing. Also check out Further/East, Further/West (which I think I like a bit better because of the tune selection)."
1,Nothing happens on 2nd CD,"I played this CD again to work out why I dont play it when I like Bill Frisell so much, especially Live, his early stuff, but also Nashville, Intercontinentals and Blues DreamIt was the second CD of the two, I certainly prefer the first (with I heard it through the Garpevine etc)It was a real snooze-athon, with no great melodies or guitar breakouts.Do yourself a favour and buy Nashville, or Second Sight by Marc Johnsons Bass Desires with Bill and John Scofield, or Blues Dream"
3,Good but not the best of Bill Frisell,I think that is a good but not e special cd if you know Bill Frisell
5,frisell is the best!,"this cd is very VERY good. bill is doing things that i have never heard anyone do with the guitar. he has perfected the use of his effects and uses them very tastefully. the first disc is most bill's originals, in particular, ""blues for LA"" is one of the most driving songs ive heard. frisell is improving (not saying he wasnt always sick)and this CD just shows how original of a guitarist he is. GET THIS ALBUM. the standards he does so well, and his guitar is better than ever (even though i wished he still used the vol. pedal). again, get this."
4,love for Thomas,"I bought these for my nephew's 1st birthday because he was too young for the wooden Thomas trains. He still loves them 6 months later! He does not use them as bath toys, but as regular toys instead. They are the perfect size for little hands and he can carry them everywhere. Very worth it for the younger Thomas fan :)"
4,Cute squirties,"We bought these for our youngest daughter who is only 10 months old. She kept trying to steal our older daughter's wooden Thomas and Friends. We figured she would like these and they would be safer for her to play with. They aren't really meant for a baby her age, but she really likes them. They do have a rather strong plastic smell to them, but I""m sure that will go away with time."
1,NOT a BATH toy!,"This is my first product review ever! I love to read them, but have never felt the need to leave one until now...My son received these ""bath"" toys for his birthday and loves Thomas, Percy, and Salty! However, these are the WORST bath toys ever created! 1. They leave awful marks on my tub that are very difficult to remove--thankfully it is possible to scrub them off. 2. They don't squirt well. 3. What do you do with trains in water??? There are no tracks to run them on...Therefore, these toys have been banished from the tub and have become just regular toys. For this purpose, my son loves them, but in the tub they are worthless."
2,Thomas squirters,These were a disappointment. They are not easy to fill for small children. I would not recommend them. Sorry.
2,Oh how I wish it were like the short...,"Everyone should view the youtube short under the same name, along with the two trailers for this movie. They are all very clever and funny. But, you should stop there. This feature does not live up to the high standards set by the shorts. The acting is subpar/overacted and the humor just isn't there. Not to mention that the soundtrack just gets annoying. The witty humor of the internet clips remains only during the scenes taken from the online videos, but everywhere else is dry. It was very hard to stay awake throughout the whole thing (whereas I still watch the youtube short). The special features are interesting, but the overall plot and movie itself was very disappointing. It was filmed very well, and i could deal with the cheesy special effects because it didn't take away from the humor of the internet clip. In summary, 305 was very disappointing."
3,So Dumb...It's Funny!!!,"This is a stupid/funny spoof of 300 and The Office. Although I've never watched the office, I think I get most of the jokes, because Claudius is holding that cup every single time we see him. Claudius is kidnapped, and the 4 other Spartans must save him. The visuals and backgrounds look pretty fake, but if you have a great sense of humor, you'll probably like 305!!!!"
1,Really Bad,"Pornos have better actors. Gandhi was funnier. Peanuts is more interesting. 10,000 is more historically accurate. Music videos for local bands have better production value.There's nothing done well in this movie, in fact to call it a movie is to debase the medium. The acting is horrible, far worse than any local theater production I have ever seen other than elementary school performances. The writing is horrible, filled with tired cliches, melodrama, and nonsense. The filming is horrible, all done in front of a blue screen that doesn't seem calibrated correctly.It's not worth watching at all."
5,Old time jazz,This is an excellent CD for those who like old time jazz. The old favorites are given a fresh sound. Mike's own songs are inspired. I see great things happening for this young artist.
2,Oddball Book,This is one of the strangest books...oddly written. It takes awhile to get into the rhythm of the speaking vernacular with which the author uses.
3,more like 3 & 1/2...,"This book was very enjoyable and a fun read but not something I would read twice.The novel goes through the life of Ann Ransom. You meet her when she is very young and only living with her mother. By the end of the book, she is living with her son. Each chapter is a different time in her life and a different story. It comes together nicely though I did feel as if some of the stories were kind of like ""fillers.""Maybe the problem was that I had very high expectations for this book and it didn't live up to them."
2,I thought this book was supposed to be funny...?,"I was looking forward to a fun, light read. Instead I got a depressing memoir. I know it was not 100% about the author but you wonder which parts were ""changed"". Don't read this book if you're looking for laughs. It really isn't funny..."
5,Stop That Girl,"I bought the book after a reading at Women and Children First in Chicago and discovered a delightful, poignant book. The characters have real affection for one another at the same time they revel in the others' failings and weaknesses. The relationship between the mother and grandmother woven through the book make you want to read from section to section as you learn that the underlying love in families carries them through some truly wild rides. The book is that life adventure I expected to put down but didn't until there were no more pages to read, and then I shut Stop That Girl reluctantly."
4,shows life cycle of a jackolantern,It is a jumping off point for a science project great for preschoolers that can last several months in the fall.
5,book review,Fun halloween reading. We even decorated our entry table with this and other good pumpkin books.
5,angel lopez re-inventado a gift for your ears,angel lopez has a voice that can heal the soul and is truely a gift for your ears. Every track is well done and shows the range that this singer has.
4,Insightful,I appreciated the style and methodology of the text. An easy read. I would recommend any leader to read this
3,Average,"Evil Dead: H.t.t.K is an average game. The controls are a little inconvenient, but this after all, a dreamcast tiltle. Graphics and story are fairly decent and there's alot of blood (not one for the kiddies). For the price it is a nice little pick-up to add to your dreamcast collection."
4,This game is fresh......,"Evil Dead was a great 3 dollar made movie. Thats what made it shine that special shine. This game has half that special shine. Now, this game can get frustarating at times but then you get to a new area and your all happy again. This game has very clumsy controls but you'll get used to them. Sometimes the camera can have bad angles. I like this game becuase it offers challenge and good graphics and pretty good play. The one thing I wish would happen in this game is that you could fight ashes dead girlfriends. (evil dead 1 and 2)."
2,"Don't ""swallow this"".","I have to admit, I was pretty excited that an evil dead video game was to be released. I also thought a ""resident evil"" format would also be a good way to present the game. Nope. Where is Capcom when you need them? I couldn't play this game much longer than 10 minutes before I threw it down in disgust. The idea is great, but it just wasn't pulled off properly. The play control is seriously bad, the voice overs just get annoying, and the over all feel of the game isn't what it could have been. The funny thing is, I thought since they had so many delays in its release that it would be really great and polished. Wrong again. Not enough redeeming qualities. Evil dead was a great ""B"" movie! This doesn't even rate as a ""C"" game."
2,A disappointment,What can I say? It's a Resident Evil [copy] that I got really frustrated playing. The controls [are bad] and even the Evil Dead references aren't enough. Avoid if you're not a big Evil Dead fan.
1,What a piece of junk,"After waiting months for this game (it's a couple months late), I got it home only to find that it was completely unplayable. The graphics are decent, but the control is horrible. I got only 10 minutes into the game before giving up completely. These guys need to learn how to usability test their games before shipping."
2,Doesn't live up to the name of the Movie,Sure this is an Evil Dead game but whos kidding. This game isn't that great. Games based on movies usually suck But I gave this game a try(yes the Dreamcast version of course) and it wasn't all that gret.The graphics are ok I guess. The controlls suck. Gameplay is dull otherwise if you love Evil Dead and want to try out the games steer clear away from this hunk of junk. It's your choice but trust me it's not worth the money. Crappy game.I give this a 2 out of 5 stars...Lates
1,worst controls alltime,how can anybody like this terd yeah it has neat graphics and sound and bruces voice but the controls are the worst in videogame history no joke basically u walk around with jerky animation using a button to flail your chainsaw in every direction with no aiming at all even worse it gets stuck in the creatures and runs out of gasoline cause of technical glitches the whole game u are running 15 frames per second in grainy semispooky backgrounds flailing your chainsaw at poorly drawn creatures this games a joke i own 5 game systems nearly 400 games and beat ever 1 of them but i wont even play this disgrace 1 time even for 6 bucks its not worth it
2,Not impressed.,"I am a little bit disappointed with the performance from these speakers. Well I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on these speakers and please spend a little bit more to get the sounds that you'll be happy with. I want to return them but I already opened the box, used the wires and the screws and installed them. Not really happy with them.Thank you Amazon for the great fast shipping."
5,Great Speakers,"i bought'em with a lanzar HTG447 1400 watts RMS amp. and those speakers are pretty loud with this amp, i have'em parallel with 2 6x9 kenwood and my car is pretty loud, great high range, really better that i thought...!!"
5,Great Basball Comedy!!,This is a great basball comedy starring Hary Hamlin and Mimi Rogers.It's a must see!!
1,Wrong Audio Clips!,The audio clips claiming to be from this album of Bach cantatas are really from a 19th-century opera. You might want to correct the problem if you expect to sell the CD.
4,Heavy Reading...,This is heavy reading (but then again which book on costing isn't?). However it contain heaps of very useful and relevant approaches to the very elusive and difficult field of supply chain costing. What you find missing in other books on supply chain management is here!
4,Every man thinks his mother beautiful,"Tanizaki's memoirs are more for the Japanese. They discuss profusely Kabuki theatre performances or great Kabuki interpreters, as well as Japanese eating habits or geographical changes in old Tokyo.But on the other hand, they show how a writer finds inspiration and characters for his books in his daily life encounters.His memoirs are also a tribute to his mother ('so strong is the influence of one's mother in early childhood') or some of his school teachers, who left deep and enduring marks on young Tanizaki.They also give indirectly a more global portrait of Japan in the late 19th and the beginning 20th century: poverty (people give away their children), geishas and pederasty.This book shows also the sometimes unsurmountable translation difficulties. After giving a book excerpt Tanizaki remarks: 'In such passages the most important is the combination of Japanese and Sino-Japanese sounds...'A book for the Tanizaki aficionados."
3,Just a OK movie,"I thought this movie would be a great movie to watch, but it wasn't that good at all."
4,A romantic comedy for almost everyone,"I watched this with my wife, brother, sister-in-law and niece. At least half the people who watched it are not huge foreign film fans [the movie is subtitled only.] However, everyone enjoyed it, frequently laughing-out-loud. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars [it warrants 4 1/2] is because the main male character is too much of a wimp and the main female is too much of an ice-queen. However, an argument could be made that perhaps she's as dysfunctional as him; but we just don't see the relationship from her viewpoint."
4,See the dorama,"Train Man, the movie, is likable enough - the based on fact story of a geek who's unexpectedly thrown into a relationship with a woman who may, for him, be perfection.This was based on a famous account published in a Japanese internet group - which in itself is utterly fascinating and gripping. The problem lies in trying to make an otherwise ordinary romance seem more special than it is. Train Man turns out being fairly unsensational, even despite some smart casting choices. I would, however, strongly recommend the eleven-part Japanese drama; it's fictionalized to a much greater degree, but the dramatic peaks are more palpable."
5,Excellent early Seattle grunge,"Many Skin Yard fans don't like this record because of how different it sounds from their later work. It does take longer to get into because of its extremely strange sound, but once you've given it a few listens, little details about certain songs will start coming out and you'll realize you love this record. Like the U2-sounding guitar, crazy slap bass, and infectious chorus in ""Epitaph for Yesterday"" and the twisting, paranoid guitar instrumental ""Scratch."" I think this is the first record Jack Endino produced, and it sounds surprisingly great, better than the first Soundgarden and Nirvana records he produced anyway. The songs are much more psychedelic and complex than their later work, so if you're trying to get into Skin Yard I would definitely get ""1000 Smiling Knuckles"" or ""Inside the Eye"" first, but if you're into the SUPER-early Pink Floyd-sounding grunge music, you will enjoy this."
5,Great Game!,We played an older version of this game back in the 80's. Great to see it's still around. Fantastic Shooter Game.
4,Gradius is not for everyone,"From all the reviews, one should see that Gradius III/IV is not for everyone. If one is the type of player who grew up with 3-D games, one would trash it for being released on the Playstation platform. The problem with this argument is that if it's not appropriate for Playstation, then what platform should it be released in? Dreamcast? PC? Nintendo 64? Just because a gaming console is designed for awsome 3D games does not mean that the console should not be used for 2-D games. The Playstation is a multigenre game console designed to meet the diverse tastes of the gaming community. People with fond memories of shoot em ups might be glad that they can legally play it on the Playstation rather than to resort to illegal emulation.I highly recommend Gradius IV's boss rush mode. It's very thrilling to fight all the psychologically terrorizing bosses one by one."
2,Descent Game...Wrong System,"Gradius is a O.K. game, but for the NES or SNES if you really want to strech it. But come on....the PS2? the PS2 has produced master pieces like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Final Fantasy X, gradius does not even compare to these games. I would much rather play this type of game on my game boy advance (I bought the GBA version)With simplistic 2D game play and NES graphics I would strongly suggest you stay away from this game, unless you are a fanatic for this seris...click somewhere else."
2,Why is this on the Playstation 2?,Is this game fun? Yes. It is fun. But it is not 2001 fun. It is 1995 fun.Does this game belong on this platform? No.This is an embarassment for Sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform. But that's what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the door.I'm waiting for metal gear solid 2. You should too.
5,UNDERTAKER,"THIS GAME IS SO BAD. I REMEMBER WHEN THE ORIGINAL GRADIUS CAME OUT FOR NINTENDO, THEN LIFE FORCE: GRADIUS TWO, THEN THE FINAL GRADIUS TO COME OUT WAS GRADIUS 3 ON SUPER NINTENDO. NOW PLAYSTATION MADE GRADIUS 3 AND 4 AND THESE TWO GAMES ARE JUST AS BAD AS THE ORIGINAL THAT CAME OUT ABOUT 15 TO 18 YEARS AGO. THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME TO PLAY YOU'LL BE PLAYING IT THE WHOLE NIGHT YOU'LL LIKE IT THAT MUCH. THIS IS PROBLY THE BEGINNNG OF MORE GADIUS GAMES TO COME OUT IN THE YEARS TO COME."
1,Booooooring.....,"sigh, what a waste. you can all say that this game is quote un-quote great, and to be sure, id buy this game if it were about 5 years ago, what a waste! this game is a waste of money, time, and life. Go out there and get a real game, a game with good graphics, a fun game!"
5,Classic Shooting Action....,"Gradius III and IV is a true classic shooter. I remember playing the original Gradius and its sequel Salamander(Life Force in the U.S.) for hours....just blasting through them and having a great time with my friends(Salamander was a two player simultaneous game).Gradius does not show off the Polygon pushing power of the PS2, but that does not make it a waste or a bad game. Its one of the best shooters ever made and that will never change. It will still be a classic, twenty years from now(hell, the original Gradius is pushing the 16 year mark already....) when everyone has forgotten the latest 3D Fighter or some other 3D game that looks great but has horrible gameplay. Gradius 3 and 4 has great gameplay, and that is what really counts...not Graphics.::Goes off to play Gradius III and then some Gauntlet Dark Legacy::"
1,Save the MONEY!,"Oh, yep, it's another flyin poop shooter alright. Save your money. This game should be a giveaway, I'd be ashamed if I were the manufacturer. It's a damn poop flyin' and poop shootin' frenzy."
1,Please rent it before buying.,"I was expecting a PS2 game, but I got something that looks like it should be played on an Atari 2600. Even PS1 games leave this one in the dust. Instead of Gradius III & IV, I would reccommend G Darius (PS1). Even though it's an older game, it is way better than than this embarrassment."
1,This book was terribile. DO NOT BUY IT.,The book is poorly researched and written. Innuendo and propaganda permeates and dominates the writing. Don't waste your money on this book.
4,Muppets,Exactly what I wanted....16 words required blah blah blah blah blah blah bleee blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
4,Pyle-Pro PH44 150 Watt -> Good Sound,The Pyle-Pro PH44 150 Watt Compression Horn Tweeter (4-inch x 4-inch) is very good tweeter. The sound is clear and the price es excelente! I'm very happy with my Tweeters.
2,Ohm Loads vary too much,"The horn sounds mediocre for the price, but we started using Pile speakers to replace damaged cabs, and then our amps started tripping. The culprit was the Ohm loads, which ranged from 6-12 ohms for these guys. We have since replaced them with Peavey's and everything is running well again."
5,Heartwrenching,"I must say I thought that after reading the first book, the next one would not live up to the first; however, I would pleasantly surprised to find that Wounded lived up to first and surpassed it with more emotion and a lot more action. As a reader, I find that some authors try to tackle multiple perspectives; however, the stories often suffer for it. Lane's ability of encapsulating various viewpoints never takes away from the story, which is definitely a feat in itself. I recommend the Little Goddess Series wholeheartedly to anyone with an open mind and an open heart."
4,decent...,"Snowboarding games aren't my favorite.. I'm more of an RPG gamer. However, Pure Ride is an incredible amount of fun to play and it's one of those games you never get tired of. Lots of board choices, fair amount of riders, and a lot of good slopes. The tricks are interesting, although sometimes it is a bit difficult to hammer out the really high scoring ones. The graphics are smooth and visibility is good for the most part, but at some points it's hard to see what's ahead of the rider. The only other gripe I have is the soundtrack.. 10 songs isn't too bad, but I'd prefer a better selection. All around I think it's a great game and at least worth renting for a while. There's also some pretty cool videos to unlock and watch."
1,"An American journal of an academic year abroad: Krakow, 1972/1973","Excellent for dramatic readings. Once you read the ""chapter titles"" you will want to read more - especially the one titled:""Take the Tram Stan"". Photos grainy and lack depth, definitely done by an amateur. Author appears to be grammar and spelling impaired."
3,lente Nikon 18-70mm,"El lente funciona bien, aunque el deslisamiento del lente es un poco brusco se pega, espero que con el uso logre suavisar, aunque lo dudo tengo una semana y sigue igual :("
4,pretty dang good,"I bought this after looking for a walk around lens and so far have been very impressed. It is much sharper than the 18-105VR lens. The lens construction isn't hugely inspiring but the image quality more than makes up for it, especially considering I got this lens for $220 on Ebay. I would recommend buying a used lens which you can easily find for close to $200.I just rented the 17-55 2.8 DX lens this weekend to compare to this 18-70 and after 20-30 comparative shots, I can't tell any difference. If a person were making large prints there might be a difference but for an everyday lens the 18-70 works great. I don't do a lot of low light work, so the 2.8 isn't a big deal. If the light gets a little low, just jack up the ISO with the 18-70.Great lens!"
2,If you don't mind Dirt INSIDE!,"This is a great lens for outdoor photography and works ok indoors with a flash. Also a good all-around starter lens. I purchased mine in a kit with my camera.However when Nikon designed the lens they ignored the fact that every time the lens is zoomed in and out, it sucks in dirt and dust from the outside like a vacuum cleaner! After owning it for only a couple months, I started noticing dust inside all over the front lens group. Once contaminated on the inside, there is no economic way to remove the dust. Having it serviced by a Nikon authorized tech is cost prohibitive. Might as well buy a new lens. Too bad, otherwise it's a very versatile lens. If it weren't such a dust sucker, I would rate it 4 stars."
4,An excellent kit lens,"I chose to get this lens when I recently purchased a D80. Reviews and the fact that the 18-55 and 18-135 kit lenses use a plastic mount convinced me to go with this one instead.Pros: Construction is good and it feels good when in use. Focus is fast and auto focus and zoom rings are well placed and very usable.Cons: Nothing unexpected from a lens with these specs.Overall this is a good starter lens. That said, it is what it is. It is not a fast lens and does best with bright outdoor lighting or a flash. I plan to get a Sigma 30mm 1.4F soon for indoor/low light shots. I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Image Quality poor,"I purchased this lens in preparation to receiving my Nikon D300. The camera arrived & I could not wait to try out the lens & camera. Very disappointed in the lens. Compared to the less expensive 18-55mm it lacks contrast & sharpness. I have since returned the lens & now have learned they have stopped production, I am not surprized. The plastic 18-55 has less build quality but produces a better immage.Check them out on the computer at 100% enlargement. My copy was a grey market lens I don't know if that contributed to the quality issue."
2,it's nice but...,"I really like this lens for the optics and the range but my 18-55mm VR lens works out so much better for the kind of shots I have been taking. I like the fact that this lens has the manual focus override with auto focus but I really noticed how much better my shots are in low lighting situations with my VR lens. the stops can be alot slower, and for me I found out that that comes in real handy. I liked this lens but have noticed my VR lens is cheaper and with it I rarely reach for my 18-70 lens now."
2,Not one of the good ones......,"I am a 24 year old mom of two children; five and four year old. This game might be fun if you like to walk in circles and doing things over and over again. But it is very frustrating and hard to hardle specially for little ones. I played it for hours but never got more than 4 goldens tickets, got 201 red tickets but what's the POINT! They are not worth anything. My brother bought this game for his 7 year old daughter who kept calling me to help her play, because she kept saying ""it's too hard"". Kids loose interest in extremely difficult games, since you can't get much proggress playing for hours and IT IS hard to get golden tickets! And you can't do anything without them.About Graphics, I think they could have done a better job. It's kinda fun with the character's comments but that's just it. I wouldn't buy this game for my children. Tiny minds, simple games; but this game is anything but simple."
1,Who's responsible for this?,"If you cherish your sanity, steer clear of this thing. If you ever happen to run into it, stop, look the other way, and run. This has to be the worst game I've ever played and I've played quite a few. The graphics, the sound, the gameplay; it's all bad. After sitting through an hour of it, I asked my 10-year-old cousin what he thought of it and he said ""Please turn it off."" I concur."
2,Rugrats in Paris,"It's pretty good but two of the games are IMPOSSIBLE! So don't bother going into OOey Gooey World to get your golden tickets. I got mine with the other games and the 4 puzzles(collect 120 red tickets-30 for each) and play those. Now this game is supposed to sell to the 4 to seven year olds, but many of the games are too hard for them. I can't even do the OOey Gooey world games and I'm an adult. I'd say they missed the boat on this game."
3,Encountering Jesus in the New TEstament - Student Text,Textbook had a fair amount of tearing on the cover with a large chunk missing from the back. The damage was more than I was expecting based upon prior purchases.
5,"Just Great, Brand New","I gotten the book on time as it said. i got free shipping. the book was brand new, still in plastic.People who have second thoughts, Dont think that u won't get the book, but u will, this is no fake thing or a thing just to take your money. Thank You 4 every thing. :)"
4,"Oh, for the London production!","Irma la Douce (the music-free film notwithstanding) is a surefire winner. I've seen the original Peter Brook production in London 1960, a version, in German, in Germany 1987, and once (1960s) had an LP of the London production, which I played perhaps until it wore out: anyway, it disappeared, along with the original barman, who in my opinion was better than Clive Revill, more Gallic (despite having an Italian name I forget). All were excellent, and so is this DVD; though again, I preferred the somewhat-more Gallic-sounding English cast. The Broadway American accents sound too beefy for my taste, shades of the 'South Pacific' chorus. But that's a minor quibble; the show's great! Keith Michel, Elizabeth Seal: sheer magic! And, as he wrote and told me once, the late, lamented Ronnie Barker was in the London original!(If anyone knows where I can get a copy of the pre-Revill London cast, I'd be glad to hear about it....)"
1,Bloody pseudo-history,"This was nothing but a disappointment. I watched it with my kid because I thought it would be educational. The title and description give the impression that this is about the engineering feats of the Romans. Instead, it was mostly a sensationalized pseudo-history of the Roman Empire emphasizing as much blood and gore as possible. This DVD is prime evidence of how low the History Channel is willing to go. The actual engineering feats are quickly brushed over, giving almost no details at all. Instead, the emphasis is on bloody violence, such as the stabbing of Caesar, gladiatorial gore, and Nero's murder of his mother. When they showed Nero slitting his own throat and then did a retake of it, I turned it off. If I could have given this a negative rating, I would have. Whatever you do, don't watch it with little kids."
4,"Beautiful Bead Collection, Pre-teen Fun","We really did a splurge and got several Bead Bazaar sets for our daughter's Birthday Slumber Fiesta (we had tacos, sopapillas, nachos, etc.) These were gifts for the girls to take home as well as an activity, along with the movie, food, games, etc.The blue/sky set is exquisite. The bamboo box itself is wonderful and a lovely sturdy gift that can be enjoyed even when the beads are all gone. The girls had fun creating gifts for one another.Other pre-teen items I feel comfortable recommending:Girls mystery series that has positive role models and clever plots.The Statue in Glen Park (Cassie Kingston Mysteries),The Message in the Transom (Cassie Kingston Mysteries)The movie we all had fun watching at the Fiesta.Race to Witch Mountain (Single-Disc Edition)"
4,Good product for the price.,"Some beads had no piercing, so they were not usable. Making jewelry using this product needs help from an adult because it is somewhat difficult for a child to bent the wire to make earings look nice. The box looks nicer on the picture than in reality. Overall, I would recommend the product. The price is right and kids love it."
2,90% build up for 50 good action pages,I have read 20 or more Star Wars books. This one is the first book that I put down for days with out wanting to pick it up. I finally got interested and finished the book when the action started about 50 pages from the end. This book has way to much build up and way to little action.
3,"Disappointing, possibly the worst New Jedi Order book yet...","I love Star Wars. And unlike many fans, I actually like the New Jedi Order series. But this book is... well, dull. Luceno's first attempt, Hero's Trial, was quite exciting, and it seemed to promise much more excitement in Jedi Eclipce. I was wrong. Jedi Eclipse seemed to fail to capture the imagination. The New Jedi Order just isn't thrilling any more. I thought Salvatore's Vector Prime was an excellent book, and while Stackpole's installments kept up with the action, so did Hero's Trial. So what the hell happened with Jedi Eclipse? If Luceno's infatuation with cameos didn't get to you in his first book, then this book will. I didn't see the need to bring back Thracken Sal-Solo, i mean talk about has-beens. The New Jedi Order seems to have gotten nowhere in this book, a very disappointing book indeed. I hope Kathy Tyers does a good job of bringing back the true glory of Star Wars into this series."
4,"Things are looking grim, and I love it!","At the end of JEDI ECLIPSE, I could not believe how poorly things were going for the New Republic and the Jedi. I absolutely love the fact that this book leaves tons of loose ends at the end, and that I have no idea at this point in the NJO series how the Yuuzhan Vong are ever going to be defeated. I have really enjoyed Luceno's style of writing. I think his dialogue is true to the SW characters, and I especially like his ability to inject humor into his stories despite the generally grim situations the characters are in. One of my favorite dialogue scenes is the one between Han and Leia near the end of ECLIPSE. It is a dead-on read of the characters. Can't wait to read BALANCE POINT."
3,I had better plots for my action figures in the '80 s,"The first three ""New Order"" novels approach a galaxy far far away from a new prospective, introducing new characters and slowly moving the old ones (Luke, Han, Leia, and Lando) into the background. The ""Agents of Choas"" novels fail to do this, and really can't hold a candle to 'Vector Prime' or the ""Dark Tide"" novels.Enter Han Solo every bodies favorite smuggler, Take away Chewbacca and add a smart mouthed version of Jar-Jar! (Luceno should have taken note from Phantom Menace) Tie in a side plot from one of the weaker Star Wars novel trilogies (the Corelian Trilogy) and you have a novel that really doesn't take you anywhere new.Overall the novel is okay, but I came up with more original plotlines for my action figures back in the 80's."
5,just as awesome as heroes trial!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book series keeps on getting better and better and better i love all these new jedi order books this author is frikin amazing i hope he writes more star wars books in the near future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,We Will Get There?,"At least we're back on the Falcon again. Han is back to the days of old and I'm talking before Leia. He and his new found friend are what makes this book work for me. I like the humor and their sarcastic remarks toward one another. They pair up perfectly. Luke, Mara, and Jaina have better things to do or they are not worthy of reading about anymore. It makes you wonder if anything more could go wrong with the New Republic. How they could bungle up so badly and still be there. I find myself wanting the Emperor back, because you know he would have had a way of dealing with the Vong. If the books intent was to leave you hanging for the next book, Balance Point, it has a done a fine job. I can't wait. Star Wars fans, you have to read it. If you're like me, you can't get enough of it."
3,Where are the Imperials,"Where is pellaeon or Bel Ibls or Lieutet Page. Half the best charicters are missing. It was better then Hero's Tials though who wants to hear about a boring old fart like Han Solo. Create a planet or to to. toss side charters that have been barly mentined prviusly like Admiral Numb, of Tschel that guy who is always on bthe bridge when something happens on the Chimaria. Mare dietail couldent hurt. This guy's about as good as the corellian serris guy Roger Mcdoell Allen."
2,Boring. The worst of the NJO series.,"Jedi Eclipse is boring. There is nothing original about it. Han Solo continues to run around with the Chewie clone, and there is a small subplot involving Anakin and Jacen but overall, there is nothing original or exciting in the this novel. There is simply to little going on to justify the amount of writing Luceno does for this story. The only original idea in the entire story is the droid revolution that Han Solo gets involved in. Jacen is portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat, while Anakin could have ended the whole NJO series with the flick of a button. There is too much that doesn't add up, and too little of the other SW characters to make this book interesting at all."
2,Buyer Beware,"This book is a disappointing effort by a very capable and stylish author. While much of it will interest Star Wars fans, it lacks a believable story line.Chief among these story problems is that the most famous Jedi don't know if they should fight to save their own galaxy from the biggest threat in history. The Jedi act like immature adolescents who don't know the difference between idealism and duty.Another story problem for the reader is finding a way to get interested in the ""refugee evacuation challenge"", to which 50% of the book is dedicated. This plot is clearly insignificant compared to the Galactic War, yet the war remains firmly in the background until the very end of the book.If you need to read this book to ""connect the dots"" in the series, go ahead, it's well written. If you're looking for a ""gem"" from the many Star Wars books written to this point, continue your search."
3,Book Jumps To Much,This was an ok book. I did not care for how it skipped around all the time from character to character point of view. It could be better if it was more uniform and flowed together more.
2,"A let down after ""Hero's Trial""","I really thought that this book's predecessor ""Hero's Trial"" (also by Jim Luceno) was an entertaining, fun read but this book was really a let down. He did his Star Wars homework, and for that I'm grateful, but this book seemed so rushed and thrown together.Another NJO disappointment."
3,"Enough of the depressing War, Let's turn the tide!","I love the Star Wars series. I have read every book in the series and I was really excited when they started the NJO Series. But I am now getting depressed by all that is going on. I understand the need for a worthy opponent, but enough already. Is the New Republic that fought and overcame the Empire gone for good?This book keeps continuing on the depressing nature of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. The plot is shallow and the storyline has much to be desired. I'm ready for a book with deeper character development. It doesn't seem like any of the characters we've grown to love are growing and changing. This book is written for action only. I think it's about time to explore the characters, places, and the force that make Star Wars so unique.I would only read this book if you want to know the events that happen in this part of the series. Otherwise, skip this one and go right to Balance Point."
3,Solid Grunge,"This is a solid grunge recording by Jack Endino and company that is obviously overlooked. Hard to describe their sound. Kind of like Soundgarden, Melvins, and Black Sabbath put in a blender. But a little quicker. Standouts include ""Words on Bone,"" ""Psychoriflepowerhypnotized,"" and ""Material Freak."""
3,Intro to the series,"This book is basically the introduction to ""Harris Kern's Enterprise Computing Institute"". This book is mediocre, but the rest of the series is very good.If you really want to build a world class infrastructure look to _IT Systems Management_ by Rich Schiesser. It's also in this series and is everything this book is not._IT Systems Management_ does not really cover desktop support/helpdesk issues, its one minor shortcoming. For that look to _IT Problem Management_ by Gary Walker, also in this series.You'll find both _IT Systems Management_ and _IT Problem Management_ here at Amazon, and they are both highly reviewed and they will be much more helpful than this book."
4,A fantastic and powerful collection,"Collections of family essays can be a tough slog - for the readers as well as the families - but this one manages the terrain with deft insight and incredible eloquence. I received an early copy of this book from a friend and have been doling it out to myself in small, pleasurable doses. The essays are funny, dramatic and poignant. The best of the lot are from established writers like Paula Fox and A.M. Homes, but the lesser-knowns are great too. Adoption may now be a part of the mainstream American experience but what's clear from his book is how every family's story is unique. Each essay reveals the secrets, the fears and, of course, the love that lies just beneath the surface of every relationship. Whether you're a parent or a child, in a biological family or an adoptive one, this collection is a must read."
2,wildly overpriced,"I've worked in the textbook publishing industry and I know why a lot of textbooks cost so much money. But every word of this material is in the public domain, except for the superfluous editor's comments, which were no more insightful than Wikipedia. In fact, the longer poems, like ""Don Juan,"" are exerpted, anyway. This is exactly the kind of text that should be accessed through something like Googlebooks."
1,Not a Good Buy,"I got the Sanus DFSAT, but immediately returned them because I thought the product was not worth the price I paid. The Nustone based does not have the ""look and feel"" of granite, instead, it is really just medium grade plastic.The stand itself is too light, and the base is too small, so there is a risk of the standing falling over. While my speaker wires may be on the thick side, the holes to guide the wire through the poles were too small. The entire stand is basically held together by two screws, and thus the entire construction will, at best, be always wobbly and insecure.I do not recommend purchasing this product."
4,comparable to CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL,"Battlefield Baseball is a wonderful outrageous film, similar to CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL. It's a lowbudget romp with an abundance of cheesy jokes, plenty of gory bloody effects, and an occasional musical number. It's also got a ridiculous psuedo-heart warming backstory behind the main character.What it has beyond, though, is crazy zombie-like monsters intent on killing, and who kill in bizarre baseball-related ways. It's got off the wall martial arts battles between family members. Just top notch.It slows here and there, but still picks things up again pretty quickly and easily gets you back in the swing of the humor and action.So if you've been looking for a baseball movie with tons of violence, over the top silliness, and a couple of musical numbers, this is absolutely your one stop shop."
3,"must RENT, but unfortunately not a must BUY!!!","from the description and the overall premise of the movie, i felt that i was in for a treat, but overall i was disappointed with the whole presentation.only reason i did not give it below a 3 is because it isn't the type of movie to be taken seriously.it's comedy.not the most memorable comedic movies made though.rent it.buy it only if u like it.i liked it, but i should've rented it first haha.peace"
3,Batlefield Stadium,"I don't know if this is the place legends are made but this was one of the weirder movies I have ever seen. It starts off with the principal of this school looking forward to this baseball tournament. Then he finds out that the Gedo school is going to be in it. The Gedo school is like a zombie school that doesn't play baseball, but they do show up to the field with bats.So we dont' really get a story here but I felt the kung fu mother and the umpire make this movie worth a watch. Don't expect a movie anywhere near as good as Versus which stars the same lead actor but with limited budget, I thought this was a film that had it's moments."
5,I hate Baseball but loved this movie.,"If you like corny Japanese movies, this one is for you. If you like hot Asian men with long hair. Well, there is only one piece of eye candy but he is a treat and goes all out with his acting for the camera. There is nothing in the world like seeing a grown Asian man cry and at the same time being as macho as possible.See it at least once.The dvd xtras are not that great and the 'zombies' in the film are not really zombies in the traditional sense [Fresh..brainnns.....] but are actually quite lively and apparently are high school students out to take over the world through baseball.Also, this is not a predictable movie by far. I guarantee that you wouldn't have guess what was going to happen."
2,"Dad bought me a camera, so I made a film","Mostly silly or stupid. Some creativity present, but ineptly presented. Many boring talking-only scenes. There is a concept here that could have been fun, but it is directed and shot in such a quickie and unstylistic offhand way that it never gels. By the way, there ain't no baseball in this film."
3,It's NOT for office wars...it's too wake people up!,"The previous reviewer (Sam) didn't try using this to get the sleepy heads out of bed. As far as I can tell, it was originally produced in the UK. If you have a kid that won't get up in the morning, pull the pin, lob this thing into the room, and listen to them scream. Yes, you can silence it by holding down the handle, but that's so the kid can silence it while carrying it to mom so she can put the pin back in (alternatively, you can pull the pin and toss the pin into the room also). Check the reviews on the UK websites. It's a hit when used for its intended purpose."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed. I pull the pin and wait...for...a clicking sound and not a loud clicking sound. Sourced my product from the UK. Very disappointed.
2,All Hype,Mostly hyped up advertising. Not nearly as loud and annoying as described.I removed the speaker cover to get a few more decibles but still not very impressive.I see now why some companies discontinued this product from their line.
1,Too Easy to Get Around,"The whole concept here is great, but it's too easy to get around. My husband tries to use it to wake me up. I can just hold down the handle and the alarm will stop sounding. I have even fallen back asleep with the alarm in my hand. Great as a child's toy, but don't bother with it as an alarm clock!"
1,Wrong part,"The rack and pinion was to short for my car, 35 inches. When I order the part, I specify the car brand, model, year, number of door (each of one facing the street), engine size, four speed, gas, carburators barrel, and many additional information. I almost send my picture. The real length of the rack and pinion is 45 inches. I returned the wrong part and I'm waiting for the reimbursement minus 20% or more for processing fees and I don't know how many additional things."
5,"A ""must"" for backpacking across Newfoundland, Canada.","In Backpacking Across Newfoundland, we travel along with Gilbert Penney and his hiking companion Harvey Rice through the means of Gilbert's daily journals composed during his long distance hikes. Gilbert's observations, reflections, descriptions and anecdotes are as refreshing and inspiring as the landscapes through which he trekked. Backpacking Across Newfoundland is highly recommended reading for the armchair traveler and inspiring for all who love, work, and walk through Newfoundland's natural landscapes."
1,The previous reviewer has it backwards.,"The legends that the previous reviewer stated as false were the actual legends told by the original Yosemite Indians and they weren't Miwoks.If anyone has any investigative skills they can determine that Tenaya was not Miwok and neither were the Awahnees.This book was just written so that the Southern Sierra Miwoks can get federal recognition when they have questionable documentation.Most of the ""Southern Sierra Yosemite Miwoks"" descendents are really San Joaquin Valley Yokuts, Mono Lake Paiutes and Monos from neighoring tribes.I have seen the earliest census rolls and there are some BIG problems with the ""Yosemite Miwoks""."
3,Great Speaker if you have a LOT of time,"22 inch wide speaker that requires full depth around it. Standard home walls are framed 16 inches on center. If you buy this, make sure you have some construction experience in your tool belt, because you will have to cut the stud(s) in the wall to make it fit. My location was easier than most to resolve. If it's a load bearing wall look for a smaller speaker."
3,A New Christmas Classic,"This ranking is solely for the title track Christmas by the Bay. I heard this on both 98.1 KISQ and 103.7 KKSF and it has the makings of Christmas classic. I look forward to adding this CD to my Donnie Hathaway, Vince Guarldi and Nat King Cole Christmas collections"
4,Great Theme song!!!,"I loved the song when I heard it for the first time and as a bonus there is a track with my favorite singer, Kenny Washington it's always a treat to listen to. check him out at the Top of the Mark (Mark Hopkins Hotel Sn. Fco.)"
4,Socks!,"Many many sock patterns. Definite plans to make several of them. Great book, easy to read. Arrived in short period of time and in good condition"
4,Love the Whimsical Socks,"I looked at this and the ""Favorite Socks"" books. I decided that I wanted (needed) both books. The SOCKS, SOCKS, SOCKS book has a wide range of patterns. In the front there is a step by step section on the how-to of sock knitting. From the simple to the adventurous level, there are plenty to choose from.I really liked that there was a whimsical section. Here are the socks that you won't find everywhere. From the ""Sunrise Socks"" to ""Little Piggy Toes"" you will find something for you.There are plenty of patterns that work up easily but are definitely one of a kind. It makes sock knitting fun to learn. You will want to make everyone from the kids to the kid at heart several pairs from this book.This is a great book for the sock knitter. I would recommend this to anyone. Happy Knitting!"
2,not visually pleasing,"Although some of the patterns were quite lovely--and creative! one pair is knitted using licorice--the book is not lovely. The photographs of people either wearing or holding up socks are distracting, to say the least, and add little. Also, no yarn information is given for the sample versions shown."
1,Socks Socks Socks,"This is a totally unusable book. I've been knitting for over 50 years so I'm not inexperienced, but of the two patterns I've tried in this book, neither worked. It has some fun projects to look at, but nothing to recommend the directions for making the two I've tried.Socks Socks Socks: 70 Winning Patterns From Knitter's Magazine Sock Contest"
2,Too many errors and not enough corrections online in errata area.,"I've had this inspiring book for a few years. The first pair of socks I tried to knit from the directions were too frustrating. I started the socks 3 times and realized it had errors.After searching online for the errata (which was not an easy task), I found that few corrections were listed. Unfortunately the corrections I sought were not to be found.Interweave Press publishes wonderful books but they need to proofread carefully prior to publication. It's as though the buyers become the editors."
3,Maybe I'm too old or something,I personally liked the game. I echo some of the other reviewers when they say that it is like the old games. Maybe that's why I like it. It's good fun for us older gammers who aren't into killing other beings. The graphics are great. Much better than the old comador 64 which was my first track and field experience. If you're having friends over it's great to sit back and see who still has the eye hand thing down. We enjoy it but also get frustrated with the difficulty of the floor excersize :(I'm not sure when that became a track and field event. So if you're looking for something that doesn't take a lot of game experience this is for you. Maybe if nothing else it's a good way to get mom and dad playing with you. More ammunition with the grandparents :)
3,"Not too bad, but could be better","The title says it all. The game has amazing graphics which leave you staring at the screen for ages. You'll spend more time watching the replays than bashing the buttons. Graphics aside the game is nothing new. An outdated control system which leaves blisters on your hands isn't ideal but it does its job. But the worste thing is the lack of events, although each event is good enough there are far too few. Spend your money on this game and it'll keep you playing for just about long enough to buy another game."
2,OK I Guess,"This game has little excitement and gets very old very fast. I made the mistake of buying it for a launch title, (its strictly rental material). Graphics are great but theres very little to the game itself. Stick with Madden 2001, Timesplitters, and SSX for great launch games."
4,Hard Labor For Fun,"The game I think is great. The graphics are amazing, and life like. The shots of the arena, with the crowd, and other particiapants, are incredible. Not only are the graphics a good enough reaon to buy the game, also, there is very little load time. Very little. After picking an event, the game displays what event you chose, then you play. Thats it. No more than 10 seconds. But, in order to get the game goin, it does require a lot of button mashing with the x and o buttons. in some games, while mashing the x and o, you have to hold down the down arrow on the D-pad, or the L1 button. You will need at least 3 hands for some events."
1,some kind of sick joke,"essentially, konami needed some loot for christmastime: their solution, releasing this and gradius.The graphics in this are a must see. They are creepy. The players look like showroom dummies animated to exact their revenge on the olympics.The gameplay is the opposite of confusing. I don't really understand how ""press buttons fast"" can be confusing, especially since they pummel how to play into your head before each event.I rented it, and took it back after 5 hours and got a different game because i had gotten gold in each event the 2nd time trying.Maybe konami had a deal with sony to invent a game that would only break your controllers..."
1,Save Your Money...,"If you enjoy a lot of repetitive banging of primarily the X and O keys then this is the game for you. The graphics in areas are impressive, but since when are weightlifting, gymnastics, or trap shooting track & field events? This game is a huge disappointment. I think this is nothing more than ESPN trying to cash in on the recent Sydney Olympics. No fun."
2,Don't Waste Your Money.......,"Don't wate a cent on this title, hard gameplay and terrible event play does not help the nice graphics of this game. I was a true fan of track and field titles, but after buying this one I will think twice. Many of the events are tricky to perform and the repetativeness gets old after a while. My top picks for the ps2? SSX, Fifa 2001, Smugglers Run. Spend your money on one of those"
4,Intriguing Tales of Espionage,"""Cloaked Mode"" is a witty and clever collection of stories as told through the Case Files of the World Espionage Bureau. The reader is whisked away on wirlwind adventures with WEB Agents Attewelle and Terry. Each case is a story unto itself with its own momentum and unpredictable ending. Raetz brilliantly paints wonderful and exciting images of the exotic locations and blend in the native tongue of the locales for some added flavor, wrapping the reader into the story."
1,Don't be fooled into thinking this is a book!,"This is a very small booklet comprising 20 sheets of A10 size paper placed together, folded and then stapled in the middle to provide 80 smaller pages plus cover. Finished size is 185 x 123 mm.This is No 8 in a series of similar books - each of which has its own theme (in this case Landing Craft) under the overall theme of WW2 Warships. The vessels include here are British; Landing barges, landing craft and landing ships.Some of the photographs are quite outstanding - especially those of the larger vessels, and the book is probably worth the purchase for those alone. Elsewhere, however, the technical information is reduced to the absolute minimum and, therefore provides the serious historian with very little information.Altogether, no more than an introduction to the subject.NM"
3,"some do, some don't","Nuns Don't Cry is interesting reading, but I tend to want more than one person's story about a subject. Liked the comparisons in unCONVENTional WOMEN: 73 ex-nuns tell their stories. Good story, though."
1,Damaged book,"This was supposed to be a new book. However it was a damaged book, with the spine end crushed and the publishers damaged book mark on it. (They still offer it on Amazon and describe it as ""new, great condition."")I contacted the seller - Vana - who first said it was a ""bargain book"" although that was not specified on the site. However, the Amazon definition of a bargain book does not include this type of damage: ""Bargain books are new but could include a small mark from the publisher and an Amazon.com price sticker identifying them as such. ...The slight mark or stamp that may be present on the edges of a bargain book's pages is an industry's identification that it is an overstocked book and is not to be sold at the full price. Bargain books are not used, previously-read, defective, or inferior in any way."" Next Vana told me the book was in fact ""new"" even though it was damaged.They did offer to let me return the book, but did not offer to pay postage."
4,Cute - Cute - Cute,"Received this for my grand daughter who is 4. This is for Christmas, I opened it up and was very surprised how well made and durable it is.I know she will love, I did."
3,"These are fun, but not very strong","My daughter loves these and plays with them all the time but I wish the magnetic part was just a bit stronger. If we pretend the dolls are walking or doing things the clothes tend to fall off easily. I don't know that my 3 yr old even notices, but it seems like it would frustrate an older child."
4,Nice dress up toy with a few imperfections,"This is a very nice dress up toy but there are a few things that could have been better: 1. the magnetic dress pieces do not stay on the doll s if you hold them upright and slide down; 2. there are a lot of articles of clothing and hats but not enough shoes that are separate from the pants (there is only a pair of rain boots and bunny slippers). The very good thing about it is that there are three pockets that your child can put away the pieces in as opposed to other sets that do not have covers and the set does not emit any funny/toxic odors. Overall, I would recommend it but wish they made the magnets stronger so that they would not slide down and make more shoes."
2,Alex Korner new CDs,"I have to agree with the other reviewer (Dave Peters) in saying that the Alex Korner set has come as rather a let down to me. I saw Alex a number of times in the late 1970's and early 1980's and always found what he did interesting. For that reason I started to pick up his original LPs and, since digital days, quite a few of the the compact disc tributes. What is really disappointing is the way that much of the same recordings seem to get re-packaged over the years and just the odd new track is added to make die-hard fans buy it. Well, I fell into the trap but can't say I feel it was money well spent. Surely there MUST be some more interesting stuff lying in the vaults than what is on this set?"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The short lived reinvention of the Wild Cats was unfortunately that, as it was certainly interesting.Spartan developing a corporation to take over and really annoy a lot of people, Grifter as the beaten up drill sergeant, and the series was cut off just as it was going along nicely.Definitely worth a look, this one."
1,Mastering Netware 6 by James E. Gaskin,"This is the worst book i have ever read. The title seems attractive ""Mastering Netware 6"", but please don't expect you can master Netware 6 after reading this whole book. What you will learn here is just the basic skills in using Netware 6. There is again and again explanations of how to configure NDS settings such as set restrictions. Just a few easy steps but the steps are listed and explained again and again in different chapters. There is only one reason to buy this book....for the 90 days evaluation Netware 6 CD."
3,some good some bad,out the the 13 tracks on the CD it appears the first four and the last four are in line with her sound and style. However the middle five tracks are difficult to listen to. Track one should have been made into a full song. the CD cover gets a D for being too much like the last cover.
3,Still E-volving as an artist,"I really dig Nomadic. It has a soundscape that's quitea bit different than her debut in 1997. Here there'smore blues, brazillan, afro-cuban, and rock - lessr&b.; The musical arrangements are as interesting asher first. There's no xylophone/vibes used on this release.The main point is- Adriana has a stunning voice and herlyrical ideas are great. However, you can tell she's stilltrying to find her voice. She's still growing as an artist.And i don't think we've uncovered all the potential she hasjust yet."
3,I DON'T KNOW!!!!,"I absolutely loved Adriana's first CD. She was much more upbeat and positive. On this CD, I'm very undecided. There are only a couple of songs on there that really interested me. I was trying to figure out where she was going with this CD. I can understand that she had spent time in Brazil and that is reflected in this latest CD but, she just kills ya with it!!!!! I don't really view this as a Neo-Soul CD. That's the problem, these artists are not staying true to the art. Alot of people really aren't too familiar with Adrianna and for this reason, she should'nt have strayed from the formula."
5,Her Greatness Is In Her Genes!,"Adriana Evans is simply fabulous. I have loved her music since her debut album/cd in 1997. Her music, like her Mom's, is timeless."
4,Was looking for a particular song.,"I purchased the CD looking for the bagpipe/drum combo of ""Amazing Grace"".I actually enjoyed some of the other quirky songs. Check it out."
5,"Typically excellent reading, with one super super scene.","As with all his Spenser books, Parker's writing in this is so smooth, so witty, with so much descriptive power, that I enjoy reading it even without the nicely-progressing plot. Maybe it's because I feel that I know Spenser and Quirk pretty well, but, whatever the reason, I find the part where Spenser is being brutalized in a Southern jail and Quirk walks in and walks him out, followed by their bracing of the two instigators (not Southerners, by the way) to be the scene I enjoy reading again and again."
3,"If you loved the movies, I don't know if you'll like this","Im a big fan of the Evil Dead movies but i must say this game is not fun... It's cool to travel in the rooms of the cabin, but this game is sad because the monsters are never over, if you stop, kill a hundred deadites, they'll still attack you... Graphics are OK to be a PSone game... Hint: run, run and run!!Buy this if you are a BIG fan of the movies or if you like horror games..."
4,Great! but could have been better.,"This is a good game, but these are the bad things, and the good things: Good things: U get the shotgun, axe, rifle, and of Course! The Chainsaw!! bloody, and not impossible to beat! Bad Things: U can run out of gasoline for your chainsaw, weapon in each hand can get annoying, controlls a little weird at first, to many guys form one after another, and lastly it is to short, i got to the sencond disk in 2 hours! the first time playing. I know, there are alot more bad things than good things, but this is just my own opinion, u might give it a 5, or maybe nothin, it's up to u."
3,Ash in his worst adventure yet,"All of the movies were excellent films but the game is somewhat lacking. The story is good, Bruce Cambell's voice overs are great. The gameplay is ok.The graphics and sound are pretty good. But there is no 360 turns and auto aim which are necessities in survival horor games. The enemy design is good, and the game is decently long. But all the enemies regenerate which is annoying and sometimes frusterating, sometimes your not given good enough direction on where to go. It's a decent game and a must have for huge Evil Dead fans. But I was just a tad bit dissapointed."
1,I feel let down....,"I bought this for my (twin) sons birthday along with a DVD of the movie as requested. The movie is great, but we knew right away that this game wasn't worth the exorbitant price. I took it back to the store and complained. Games like this just shouldn't be released at any price. There are so many problems, the game is short, shoddily made, and the controls are horrendous.The last time I'm trusting a game by THQ."
1,Yuck!,"I really, really tried to like this game but...Play control is God-awful. The two handed weapon system would be cool if it had ANY accuracy what-so-ever. Even the simple process of opening a door becomes tedious. Walk up to the door, hit O, nothing happens. Walk up to the same door at a different angle, press O, still nothing. Repeat about 5 times until success...and all the while constantly respawning Deadites are pounding on you. That is of course if you can find any doors aside from those in the cabin. You may just give up after wandering aimlessly around the woods for two hours without any hints of where you should be and what you should be doing. The annoying camera angles and mundane backgrounds don't help...often times there will be a path or item right in front of you and you can't even see it!! Ash's taunts are neat at first, but how many times can you hear even Bruce Cambell say ""Yo"" and ""Come get some"" over a two hour period before it gets irratating. 200? 300? Go play..."
1,Evil Dead,"This game has nice graphics and nicely picturesque scenes, but the controls are so horrid that the fight sequences are unexacting. I found it annoying and annoyingly overpriced."
4,"Wah, wah, wah, bunch of crybabies","Boo-hoo, it was tooo hard to play...NONESENSE! Evil Dead is the king of all B horror movies and this game was awesome! I know everyone has their own opinion, but don't bad-mouth a game just because you couldn't play it. I think the game was average difficulty and intense. Ash is the undisputed king of all heroes and once you get the special moves with his movie catch phrases down, you're ripping up monsters like there's no tomorrow. If you're an Evil Dead fan (and not a crybaby), you'll love it!"
3,Necronomican Ex Mortis,"First off, I'm Chrisanot and I'm actually thirteen. Anyway, I thought this game was certainly interesting. I guess you could call me an Evil Dead fan (though I've only seen Army of Darkness)and after reading the strategy guide at Best Buy I decided I must have it. when I brought it home and popped it into my PS2 I found out that it was insanely difficult. I found my self killed at my first deadite incounter. The controls take some getting used to, and being able to say a one liner at the push of a button was a surprise to me. One very usefull tip I have is read the instruction manual very thuroughly first(I didn't find out I could run until I was almost at disc 2). Also(I shouldn't have to tell this to fans of survival horror), don't use weapons or ammo as soon as you get it, save it up for disk 2 and bosses. Overall buy/rent this if you are a fan of survival horror, you want a good challenge, or you are just collecting stuff related to evil dead."
2,Only buy it if you're an Evil Dead fan..,"..otherwise, don't bother. Even then rent it first. The story line is kinda decent. There's two things that turn me off about the game. The controls are crap. I've had better control over a game after I drank 12 beers. The other thing that turns me off is the fact that the deadites never stop respawning. Ever. So you never really clear a board in addition they also hit for a bit of damage. If you're not careful you can die with only being hit 3 times. I really looked forward to this game when I heard it was being done. I'm really disappointed in the result."
2,"Good, but not Great","I bought this game over amazon.com, because ever since I heard about it in July, 2000, I've been waiting forever. I bought it and immediately put it into the Playstation. I thought it was ok at first, but the Deadites keep coming back. You get no clues on where to go. Your chainsaw runs out of gas all the time. And the Deadite's hardly give you health. The boss's were hard, the deadite's were hard. And when I got to disc 2, I said, ""That was the shortest ... disc I've ever seen. They should of made it only 1 disc."" I beat the game in about 3 hours total. The ending wasn't much of an ending. And there were too many bosses. I give this game a 2 star. 1 star for giving you something to do for 4 hours. Another star for Bruce Campbell's voice. Don't waist ... your hard earned money. Rent it and beat it that day."
1,This game sucks it is not fun at all it is way to hard.,The only good things I can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbell's voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick like your 3 shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the 3 left handed weapons you have in Evil Dead Hail To The King this game sucks ass.
2,Wish I would not have open it,"How is it that a sucky game like this one retails at almost $100. I purchased this game after buying and playing Fistfull of Boomstick (which is awesome, along w/Regeneration) I was very disappointed. Wish I could sell it at a New price."
2,Good for some but not others,My cousin actually gave me this game and when he did I was like all right another horror game yay! I thought this game would be fun but I was completely wrong.The graphics are good and so is the music. The controls aren't to confusing but you honestly can't beat this game. Its very difficult. I tried to get some where in it 3 times but I finally gave up after the monsters kept killing my person.If you're one of those people who love really difficult games that are hard to get any where in then this game is for you. But if you're one of those people who would at least like to get some where in the game this probably isn't the game for you.Over all good graphics and music. Just to difficult to beat.
3,Evil Dead makes you evil mad... But it's worth it.,"The most annoying thing about this game is that Ash, your hereo, has to find his own fuel for the chainsaw. Other than that and the unusual angles that the camera views abstract, the game is great. Unfortunately it reminds me of the days of genesis control functions where going up a hill made your character look strange on the screen but, it's evil dead! If you're a fan, you'd love it. I have to give the game one thumb up.... not bad for a begining.Just look at the impovements since on the siblings, ""fist full of boomstick"" and ""regeneration"""
2,Disappointing,"The first foray of the cult Evil Dead horror movie series into video games began here with Evil Dead: Hail to the King. Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters, Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs, clunky controls, and the same ""find the key to open the door"" type gameplay we've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark. Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game, but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down. The Dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality, but all in all Evil Dead: Hail to the King is worth checking out for fans of the Evil Dead series or survival horror games only."
2,Impossible,"I cannot wrie much on this game as I just cannot get anywhere with it. Unfortunately you cannot save just anywhere, only @ the cabin. You are ALWAYS out-numbered severly and your chainsaw uses up fuel very quickly.I know 4 people who have had it for over a year and have still not passed the first task. Apart from the impossibilites it is quite a good game"
3,it helps if you need extra back support,I used this because I work in a department where im straining my back alot and needed something that would support my lower back. Its ok. I honestly dont know if the magnets have any difference in this product or not but this belt does help support your back and is built tough. one down side logically is that it will restrain your breathing a bit more and worse for overweight people like me and I didn't like that obviously.
2,Kind of an elementary book,The author is trying hard to make sophisticated a very elementary techinque. A much clearer book on mindmapping is a book by Joyce Wycoff.
1,Overhyped,"Well it does give a whole lot of information about how to apply mind mapping to just about anything. It also gives some slightly dubious information about how the brain works. However, this is more of an inspiriational bit of fluff, rather than a scientific explanation of the workings of the mind and the mind map.The techniques are in depth, but it also offers quite a few slightly dodgy claims about having to withold judgment when brainstorming, and the theory about keyword use really seems inpractical.Lots of colour and geewizary. But it says things in quite a complex way. I doubt anyone will find the method as good as he states throughout, over and over again, ad nausium.If you like gloss and a whacky doodle, then this is for you. But if you want to know about learning methods and the brain, stick with something other than pseudoscience.CheersD"
4,"Interesting Read, painful drawing","I don't mind this book, it is a good read and opens up the mind to the unlimited potential we have with our brains! The problem I found was trying to read in bed at night... every night there would be a new ""exercise"" to oomplete which meant I had to put the book down and follow up the next day in the study with a pen and paper... It's not really a book to read but more so and set of activities to complete which is the only way to make the information stick BUT was frustrating as it took twice as long to read as I would've liked..."
2,uninspiring!,"I was expecting this book to inspire me and enlighten me as to how to unleash the powers of my brain. The author drags on and on on how to organise notes and diagram ideas but failed to captivate my attention past the second chapter. It makes for tedious reading and is more than likely more suitable for experts in mind mapping.If your are new to the topic, like I am, then this book is not for you. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Interesting, but quite long and frankly a little repetitious","I'll recommend this book to people who already has some experience with mind mapping, but wants to get inspiration for new techniques.I think it's best as a reference book, that you can browse for inspiration, for new mindmap-approaches to problemsolving. You learn about taking YES/NO decision with dyadic mindmapping. You learn to group mindmap, and lots of other stuff.I wouldn't recommend it for mindmap-rookies. It's not a very pleasant book to read cover-to-cover. There's quite a lot of redundant information, and you spend a lot of time thinking, ""haven't I read this before?"" To get an introduction to mindmapping you should buy ""How to mindmap"", by Tony Buzan, instead.Still worthwhile if you want some inspiration."
5,Teaching people how to understand how they look at things,"As the owner of Integrity Management Solutions Group [...] I use the tools in this book, to help people see a vision for their office and how to take their business to the next level. This book will be a helpful tool to anyone needing to learn how the mind works and having a vision to take it to fruition."
4,An Excellent Text on a Powerful Tool,"The Buzan brothers present this powerful technique clearly and with plenty of examples. One gets the correct impression that mindmaps can be used in many different ways: personal planning, note taking, presentations, group discussions. Finding the layout a bit unusual, I give the book an 8. It's first-rate content is well worth the puchase."
3,It just drags on,Apparently mind mapping works for about 50% of the population. I must be in the 50% would it does not work for. Book just goes on and on explaining the same stuff over and over again. It could have been a lot shorter. I tried to use it and gave it a good wack but nothing really.To me it was a waste of time but its is a very colorful book filled with pretty pictures. Going though it I felt that I would not mind purchasing a few.
3,Interesting but ultimately disappointing,"I was introduced to Mind Maps in a short class I took in Austin Texas on concentration. The teacher was recommending this book like it was the greatest discovery since sliced bread.I must admit, I find mind maps fascinating and very useful, but this book was kind of a waste. Well, it is a waste because the points are hasshed and rehashed time and time again with no real insight offered into the technique.For those who have not been exposed to Mind Maps, Mr. Buzans other books are more help ful. For those who have been exposed to Mind Maps, this book is a disappointment. I would hope that mind maps and radiant think would be capable of inspiring the author to great depths and heights."
1,boring book w/o helpful info,all this book is about is brainstorming/spiderwebbing which i learned in 3rd grade. THIS BOOK IS TALKS OF AN ELEMENTARY TECHNIQUE IN COMPLICATED WORDS
4,GC Uof R Satire Review,"SMITH, Frederik, N. The Genres of Gulliver's Travel. Newark: University of Delaware Press, 1990. IBSN 0-87413-359-9 --- This is a series of articles looking at Guliver's Travel as travel trips. Excitement in foreign lands, as a children's book, as the travel novel, and as illustration. As well as a pictureque travel novel, Gulliver's Travels is discussed as the beginning of science fiction as well as satire in the historical and political sense. For a post-modern analysis there is also a deconstructionist approach."
1,Over rated... a waste of time,"If the mind maps would be the solution, one of the most recent human creations -the web pages- would be using them extensively. However, I have not seen any web page up to know that uses them. On the contrary, most web pages follow a traditional pattern: a column at the left and a row at the top... and it works quite well. The book is boring and repeats itself a lot. It never really has a deep and an useful chapter."
2,Elementary,This is an elementary book that insults one's intelligence. Buzan has written some worthwhile books. This is not one of them. It's a rehash of all his earlier works and is highly disappointing.
2,Silly,"This is a silly, superficial books that is nothing more than a rehash of his earlier writings. Do not like lazy authors who keep churning out the same old stuff over and over. It would seem that they would learn new things, new thougts, new insights over time. Guess not."
2,Bad choice for file boxes.,"I bought this storage system for my file crates. The unit is made from plumbing pipes! It is very challenging to put together. I had to grease the pipes before they would slide through the holes. The smaller pipes slide through holes in the larger ones. In addition, it holds large totes only but you best put the light ones on the top ""shelve"" which is not really a shelf at all. If you try to put anything smaller than large totes in the unit, they will fall unless you are handy enough to make actual shelves for the thing. The unit is not at all applicable for the purpose I intended. I wish I could send it back but the way its packaged, you must read a review like this one before you know what you're getting into."
1,beware: mine arrived without instructions,A box full of PVC pipes with holes drilled in them and no instructions for $130. Not a great deal.
2,Impossible to put together,I was so excited by the idea of have one place to organize my totes so I purchased these. I was instantly overwhelmed by the amount of screws and parts. The poles are pvc and do not fit easily into each other. The little plastic bumps that are on each piece to help you align the poles break off easily so it's hard to get them straight. I bought two sets but don't want to spend the 30.00 to send them back so I'm stuck with them. I'm very disappointed.
3,"good idea, UPDATE ON REVIEW","This is a nice idea and it is made well, so well that they are pretty hard to put together. I'm a woman and have my own wood shop and could not put these together without help. But like I said, they sre very sturdy and will last a lifetime! However, where the heck do you find the bins that will fit!! All the bins we have found are 1/4"" to tall or too wide! So frustrating!**UPDATE** 1/8/2013. Still frustrated because the only bins we have found, you must purchase from Amazon, don't get me wrong we love Amazon! But the bins that fit are; Sterilite 19608006 41-Quart Underbed Box, White Lid with See-Through Base, 6-Pack $85.00, 4 of these fit in one slot and the Sterilite 18351006 30-Gallon Tote Box, Lapis, 6-Pack $105.00, one of these fit. These bins. In my opinion are expensive but they are very durable and will probably also last a lifetime! So at the end of the day, I would purchase again and have reccomended to others."
4,It works.,"It fit my 2004 TSX fine and it seems well-made. It doesn't seem too thin or flimsy.Other than that, it's an air filter. My car hasn't complained. I haven't noticed any change in performance or anything else."
1,One Size Does Not Fit All,"Purchased the FRAM CA9564 for our '07 Acura RDX and, simply put, it does not fit (too short)."
1,Does not fit my 2005 CRV Honda,Be careful with your selection. This filter does not fit a 2005 Honda CRVnow what ?
1,BORING,I hated this book. It was a piece of junk. If you want to read REAL vampire books read Laurell K Hamilton's books. They make sense! The first book is called guilty pleasures.
4,Sturdy Ladder,This was a quality built ladder and should work for what we are going to use it for. We have only had it for a short time so durability is yet to be deturmined.
4,Excelent Debut,"For any fan of werewolves, war novels, or just good writing, this novel is an impressive first offering from Steve Ruthenbeck. Pick it up and enjoy it thoroughly."
2,Wanted it to be better...,"Cube Farm should be an insightful look at a disfunctional company. But I found the author's glib style and the lack of thorough editing to be rather distracting. I read the book in short bursts, but usually found myself aggravated at the poor editing -- typographical errors and incorrect use of words -- which, for me, detracted significantly from the points the author was trying to make. In addition, the author has a very ""black and white"" view of the world, and uses expressions like ""There are only two possible reasons for this..."" when there are clearly other options as well. Given these defects, I cannot recommend this book without serious reservations."
2,Plastic tray melted,The plastic tray included for microwaving the chicle melted (leaving a big mess in the microwave). We had to switch to a glass bowl for heating -- which is still covered in chicle after several washings. My daughter loved the cherry flavor but didn't like the cinnamon very much.
2,So so,The box is very small and the colors are quite dull which made it seem as though the product was old. Its a cute gift but nothing to write home about. I would recommend purchasing the more expensive ones.
2,Industial Cement,"I bought the chocolate making kit from the same buisness and it went really well and it was really good so I decided to buy the Gum Making Kit. So I just finished my gum making kit and I think they kinda goofed on the ""gum"" part. Your actually buying a industrial cement making kit. It sticks to teeth, leave dried up pieces of gum on your counter, and tastes horrible. My advice just buy gum from the store, It will be much cheeper. So save your money and pass on this kit."
1,pashmina,"pashmina kashmir is ONLY the NAME, not the product, the product is 100% viscose, worthless....."
5,Beautiful!!!,I really enjoyed this book. It was soo cute and each and every character gave spice to the stroyline. And the romance reached you off the page. Good job!!!
2,Very simple,"This might be a great kit for a beginner. There is very little painting to it, and really not worth the money. I would not recommend it for the avid painter."
3,White Stallion,"This is a very difficult paint-by-number. A smaller brush is necessary. It is difficult to read the numbers/letters on the board itself. Otherwise, it is a beautiful beautiful print."
5,quality paint by number,"I sent this to my niece, she loves it. I looks way more professional and real than most paint by numbers"
2,Not Enough,"They do not include enough paint to finish the project. You have to order more!!! How disappointing.The paint brush included was so poor I had to purchase others, they did recommend to buy other paintbrushes but my order thru amazon never showed up."
5,PaintWorks~Paint-by Number kit,"This was a good deal for the money~However, I would like to see better paintbrushes come with these kits. This wasn't too difficult however frustrating for younger children. Good age 11 and older."
5,Fantastic!,"I was really excited when I got this in the mail right away. Its a very detailed pbn and takes alot of time, Im almost done and I have to say it is absolutely beautiful. I want to say it looks just like the picture, the only difference is the colors are alot brighter than the picture hints at. Trust me, thats not a bad thing, its very nice and Id recommend it to anyone whos patient enough to do it."
4,"Not the best in series, but good","I absolutly love all the fabulous five books!! I am so sad they are out of print and I can't find them anywhere! :*( I think this was a good book, except Katie got to hyper when the boys started a club just for themselves. I don't see anything wrong with that, except that the girls all go crazy without any boys around!! That is totally dumb- you do not need boys to have fun."
4,Good example on how hard it is to be different,"I liked Katie Shannon's attempts to raise awareness in Wakeman on how girls are still treated unfairly. I kind of thought it was a shame of how superficial many of the girls in this series were. I don't blame Katie for being disgusted at Alexis and Heather for being boy-obsessed. Tell me about it! What a shame that in order to form her all-girls' club, she had to stoop down to their level and reduce it to a makeup and clothes fest. But I guess many of these girls aren't as intelligent as the girls in the Baby-sitters' Club series."
3,The musicality of prose,"The main reason I read Nicholas Delbanco is for the musicality of his prose: the cadence, tempo and unusual rhyhtms of his sentences, here addressed to a conventional drama of Professor Meets Girl. I'm reminded of an American ensemble who could only explain jazz to Chinese musicians by playing a traditional Chinese melody a la Theolonius Monk. Delbanco is like that. Each sentence reveals careful thought, each chapter orchestration. Not unlike a jazz musician, Delbanco receives too small attention: hunt down his novels and essays, and give a listen."
5,Homemaker,This is the best mixer I have ever owned and I have been a Homemaker for 40 years. I love the many different speeds. It has a build in timer so you know how long you have been using it at that speed. It has a retractable cord so it doesn't get all twisted and tangled when stored. It whips up great mashed potatoes. You can tell I really love it.
2,This 'Wildflower' is A Weed,"From the debutante annoyance of the shrill 'Tuesday Night Music Club' to surpassing expectations with the non-sophomore slump of the excellent 'Sheryl Crow' to the ambivalence and skill of 'Globe Sessions' - well, it's been downhill ever since. She's long ago morphed from a debutante to watch to a major nuisance. She's not only lost her voice, but she's here to prove that there's a cliché born every minute, and we're the suckers buying into it. She's never been more formulaic or mediocre. My grade: C-"
2,Too Wistful,"Definitely a different Crow. Weak voice, weak songs, weak music, weak CD. Lacks the enthusiasm and energy of previous cuts. If one didn't know better, you would think she was in a very sad time in her life. Too Wistful for me!"
5,Wildflower,"I donated this CD unopened to an organization that sends ""care"" packages to military members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.I don't know what the music is like, but I do know that somewhere in the middle-east there will be a Soldier, Sailor, Marine, or Airman who will appreciate receiving some mail and listening to some music from back ""home""."
3,Wildflower is a weed,"I really think Sheryl Crow is losing her magic touch that made her first two albums great (and even The Globe Sessions). This album is so slow. I thought this was Sheryl Crow, not Norah Jones (not that Norah Jones is bad). I almost fell asleep until ""Letter to God"" and ""Live It Up"" livened it up a little. But then it went back to the slow, boring ballads. I'd even listen to C'Mon, C'Mon over this album."
2,Perfect for doctor's offices; elevators,"Man, what a yawner! If you consider oatmeal ""too spicy"", then this is your kind of music! One song blends right into another, with utterly nothing that stands out. Sure as hell ain't ""The Globe Sessions"" (my favorite Sheryl Crow), or even the commercial, but catchy, ""C'mon, C'mon"". Great album to use as background music, 'cause you'll have it tuned out in the first couple of minutes."
2,Really boring,"Sheryl Crow is sounding very uninspired here. The songs are mostly bland, and all run together. The worse part of the CD are all the slow songs, she sings in a soft voice, hitting high hotes it sounds like she is whining in song. There is no impact of these songs at all. Almost sounds in a way like Amy Grant's Lead Me On. So mellow and mundane, good music to put yourself to sleep. Anyway, this CD is slipping fast on the charts. There is no way this release is going to be memorable. Sheryl Crow has a lot of great CDs, but this isnt one of them. She needs to go back to something lively, upbeat, and if she makes some ballads, make them sound cheerful or with some life to them. Most of these songs are dead, and two many more CDs like this I guarantee her career will be too!"
4,Sheryl Crow Does It Again,I liked the CD. I thought it had a good range of songs and styles. As with any new CD I purchase I have to listen to it a few times before I really get into it.
1,"Play To Your Fan Base, Sheryl......","I was a diehard fan when I bought this CD, but after one listen all the way through, I wanted to puke. There wasn't one decent song on the entire CD. It's lame and sterile. I gave it to my lady friend, and she gave it to her daughter. What happened after that, I can't say. I can't believe that so many people gave it such a high rating. To each their own, I guess. I have never bought another Sheryl Crow CD, and won't likely do so in the future. Awful! Reminded me of Pat Benatar's Tropico and Huey Lewis' Small World. Play to your fan base, Sheryl....please."
3,Sheryl Crow's Wildflower,"Wildflower's well chosen opening track says what is the new album about.Tunes are written mostly just by Crow or Crow+Jeff Trott.Production on the record is nothing like on Crow's previous albums and make's the new songs sound grand and the this top quality stays for the entire record.11 songs is perfect amount (2003 C'mon C'mon album had x14)and standout tracks are moody ""Chances Are"",rocking ""Live It Up"" and ""Good Is Good"" and ""Wildflower"".After listening to the album for a couple of times I'm glad this album came out and I admire Crow's sort of a new style but still it misses a couple of good rockers for the listeners and to the live concert set! 3+ stars."
2,yaaaaaawn,"This is bland, edgeless, derivative easy listening music. She often sounds like she's singing way of her register ... to the point where it actually begins to grate on the ears.I sincerely enjoyed The Globe Sessions ... this is really quite bad."
2,"Let's Hope She Finds Herself, Post-Lance","Sheryl Crow used to be one of my favorite female singer-songwriters. But with middle-age and celebrity, her music has gotten weaker and weaker. C'mon, C'mon was awful. Maybe ""Good Is Good"" will be her nadir. The whole Lance Armstrong thing was such a huge distraction, in which she clearly gave more than she got back. I look forward to what she might write -- if she faces up to the reality of being in a youth-oriented profession, single and in her mid-40s, if still obviously atractive and talented. Crow is more interesting on her own than she seems to recognize. If she shows more courage and gives up on the Prince Charming nonsense, she might produce something that ranks with her early work and that speaks to other baby boomers. If you're looking for something honest and introspective with Wildflower that ranks with her first few CDs, this isn't it. She's sounded lost for years."
3,disappointment from great singer/songwriter,"This album is alright by general standards. Most of the songs are pretty midtempo/ballad-ish. If you like ""Good is Good"" you'll like this album. And no doubt this CD is better than most out there.But for someone like me, who sees the promise of The Globe Sessions and the direction(s) Sheryl Crow could have gone since then, it's disappointing. It covers the same ground basically as the disappointing C'mon C'mon, only with less rock."
3,Thought I would never cry to a Shery Crow Song...,"I love Sheryl...love jaming to her songs while training at the gym, love the genius of her music, but Wildflower is just a tad bit deprssing to me. Sort of reminds me of Jann Arden.This collection of tracks is lacking the fun beats and lyrics (The hidden track Subway from The Global Sessions is a good example) Sheryl Crow's trademark is known for. I think love has made her a bit retospective.Nonetheless, every artist tends to stray from his/her material now and then. Wildflower is a beuatiful album to listen and sing to on a rainy day. It just lacks the fun I have come to expect on a Sheryl Crow cd. Come on girl...start rocking again!!!"
2,ZZZZzzzzzzz,"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that ""very best of"" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.Some reviewers are saying there's ""heart and soul"" all over this album?That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very ""modern"" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new ""very best of"" collection)"
5,Well many of you are being really tough,"I can't stop listhening to Wildflower...as far as I am concerned the best song on the album. And it is clearly written about her relationship with Lance Armstrong. What a love song. You all must agree it is a spectacular homage to her love for one of the best athletes to have performed any sport ever. I know people who could care less about Mr. Armstrong and they are astounded by this song. I am and I hope you all will be. The song Wildflower will hide many good tracks on this album, because it is such a lingering song. I just hope everyone will look past it and buy the record because of the at least other 5 songs that if don't capture you immediatlly will grow on you. This is really great stuff that people should hear."
3,A perfectly adequate product,"These all sound like Sheryl Crow songs, allright- rather good, one quite good. Whenever I listen to a new Sheryl Crow CD, the first thing I hear is the production. It's always very competant. On her first CD, It was actually interesting. But not anymore. Now it's like a Michael Bay movie- well produced, decently performed, and not very interesting. Ok, it's better than a Michael Bay movie, but not much."
3,"A Few Good Songs, But Most Sound Alike","If I had to describe this CD in one word, it would be subued. You won't find anything that matches the uptempo ""Soak Up The Sun"" of C'Mon, C'Mon. While this style is not inherently bad, the result here is a lot of songs that sound the same.There are some really good songs, though. ""Lifetimes"" is probably the liveliest track on the CD while ""Live It Up"" also has some good hooks. ""Letter To God"" is probably the best track on the CD. It is somewhat of a different song for Sheryl Crow. She sings with an earnestness that I don't really recall in previous work.You may be asking, what about ""Good Is Good?"" While I liked this song when it came out, I found myself pressing skip when it comes up. It just doesn't have staying power. The rest of the songs are pretty interchangable in my opinion."
3,WHERE IS SHERYL? WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PARTY GIRL?,"First off, I want to say, I am a Big Fan of Sheryl Crow and I have always Loved her previous Music because it was always Happy, Lighweight and just Down Right Fun! Her New CD Wildflower was a Big Disappoint for Me. There are a total of 11 tracks on the cd and I hate to say this but most of the songs sound the same, one song blends into the other. it is really hard to tell them apart. In all fairness to Sheryl, maybe this new musical direction can be chalked up to her Growing Older, Maturing, being in love but Unfortunatley it has made this cd sound like something you would here in an elevator. The CD isnt bad, her voice sounds good but has lost some of its edge. There are a couple of good tracks, ""Where Has All The Love Gone"" and ""Good is Good"" but overall, the cd was a disappointment and just doesnt measure up to her previous efforts. Oh Well, it happens!"
2,WHERE'S THE BEEF?,"BALLADS ARE GOOD BUT THE CD IS NOTHING BUT THEM! THE SUGARY BALLADS GROW OLD QUICK. WHERE IS THE ROCK AND ROLL? WHAT'S NEXT, THE ALBUM OF DUETS WITH ROD STEWART? ""IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY"", GO FOR IT, I'M NOT."
3,Whinny Chick Music,"Crow's other music was so rockin' with some very witty lyrics. This one is really full of ""Whinny Chick Music"". The album is not a total loss; there are some decent melancholy songs for when you are in the mood.I am still a fan. Just be forwarned.This GUY's opinion.PS- maybe I'm just jealous of Lance."
2,another so-so Album,"Sheryl Crow has never really moved me for more than 5 songs per Album&that is a reach in itself. this Album has about 2-3 decent cuts&the rest sound like patches of her past Albums over Her Career.Vocally I've never thought she was more than just ok.She looks good,but Musically She been stuck on a Formula for all Her of her solo Career."
2,So so,"I was disappoined in this one. Slow, dark and depressing.I have them all and this is the first one I didn't like."
2,suprisingly disappointed,"I was excited to get Sheryl's new CD, but found it quite boring. As a woman who is the same age as Sheryl, I can relate to where she is emotionally. There is a sense of ease and relaxation that comes with being in your 40's, and I can hear it in her songs. But I was hoping to hear more of her upbeat songs like ""Steve McQueen"", ""C'mon C'mon"", or ""Soak up the Sun"". Many of the songs on this CD sound a lot like other songs she has done, but with different lyrics! Sure, I'll listen to this now and then, but it definately won't be a favorite. I will put her ""Very Best of Sheryl Crow"" on before I put this one on. This CD was more of a sleeper."
2,Booooo,"Oh wow, what a disapointment to the surprising Cmon Cmon, Soak Up The Sun was soooo awesome. I also loved the last big hit, First Cut Is The Deepest and millions of fans turned on to her greatest and not so greatest hits. But it was a comeback just the same, and had a lot of fans waiting for the next big CD. But is this it? These songs are pretty bland and boring, this would not rate high at all compared to her overall catalogue. Mark my words, this CD is going to be a dud. It will probably go gold quickly on the strength of her popularity right now, then fall off the charts fast. The songs are boring, why not some cheery or upbeat songs? Sheryl Crow sounds like an artist not on the way up, but on the way back down. She dont sound happy in these songs, maybe she is miserable? Her misery cries out in these poorly written songs. It made me depressed, music is suppose to make you feel good. Booooo for Sheryl Crow."
4,Not Bad - Never Really Liked Her Music - But I Always Give Things A Chance,"I keep my reviews short and sweet. I never was a Sheryl Crow fan. She is extremely talented and beautiful, but I never really connected with her music. I gave the disc a spin the first time, and nothing jumped out at me. But after a little more time, the songs beagn to grow on me. I really like the single now, and there are some catchy songs. Give it a shot. You got nothing to lose. Later...."
3,Some worthy numbers,"Having been a fan for Crow of many years, her excellent pop infested guitar, I was excited to buy this but disappointed. It was a rather montonous outing and for the first time I wanted a refund on a Crow album. Luckily I had bought other decent releases like Hootie and the Blowfish's new cd which had more depth and character. Not bad but not great. Hopefully you return to form or perhaps it will grow on me with further listens but for the depressed soul this would be a grand album. Thanks Sherly for giving us some decent tunes on your recent efforts. More a 50% than 60% rating."
3,"Better than most, but too boring","Not a total downer, but kind of bland. The lyrics are OK and the music is pretty. Kind of like soundtrack music. If you're a huge fan you'll like it. If you like ""Sheryl Crow Pop Singer"" you'll not like it much. I don't fall into either category, so I'm giving it 3 stars because it's better than most of the crap that poses as ""musical artistry"" these days. And for the person who said they like Sheryl's quicky song writing and gave ""Leaving Las Vegas"" as an example, Sheryl didn't really write that song. I understand the reviewer's sentiment, but hate to perpetuate the mythology about the writing of that song."
3,after a few songs it all sounds the same,"Sheryl Crow has made some fine albums, but this is the exception.Sheryl trades in her electric guitar for a piano and an acousitc guitar.Sheryl is still writing some good lyrics, they are just not about the same things. She is writing about love and relationships.There are some good songs on the album. ""I know Why"" leads the album off in good form. ""Good is Good"" is also another performance of note.""Chances are"" almost sounds like something George Harrison would have done on Sgt Pepper, with the indian drums and all.If you are expecting a CD with rockers like some of her past albums, then dont waste your money. This a very laid back album and at times shows brilliance. The only problem with it though, is by the time you have heard the seventh or eight song, the songs starting sounding like each other. Not her best, but not a bad effort."
3,Wildflower/Crow,This is not the best of her talents with the exception of two songs.Service from Amazon was great as usual-that is why I became a Prime Member.Victoria D'Avi
2,boring,"Normally I love Sheryl Crow. I have all of her CD's. But this CD is so boring. All of the songs sound alike for the most part. There is no ""soak up the Sun"", there is no ""If it makes you happy"" , there is no ""everyday is a winding road"", there are no catchy songs. It puts you to sleep. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the lead single is OK, (good is good) and I like the album art work. Otherwise, don't bother"
3,Okay,"Her old stuff was soo much better than this, this is just 'Okay'. Get her albums from the 90's instead."
1,Horrible album,"Sheryl Crow is a fantastic singer but this album doesn't deserve any respect. All the song on this album sound dead beat. This is the worst album i ever listen to. I'm a huge country fans but this album does not sound country.I would give this album a zero if i could, what a waste of money."
2,"No hooks, no groove, no rock ... boring","The best you can say about this new album is that some of the songs are 'pretty'. But if you liked Sheryl Crow before, be warned. This is a slow, lax, middle of the road effort, where guitar riffs are exchanged for string section fills, catchy vocal hooks have gone missing and the percussion is generally a lazy 4 by 4 ballad beat.I always thought Sheryl Crow's work was fantastic ... what happened here?"
4,Mature melodic collection,"This is an excellent offering by Sheryl Crow, though my favorite song by far is only on the Special edition version (which I didn't realize and had to download the song by itself!) The Always on Your Side duet version with Sting is absolutely beautiful and is one of my all time favorites. This disc is great, but I would recommend getting the special edition instead."
3,What happened?,"I've been a huge fan of Sheryl since the word ""go"". Tuesday Night Music Club was the first CD I owned when I was 13. Her subsequent releases just got better and better. Then we get to ""C'mon, C'mon"" which was a sugary coated beach romp. Fine. I was willing to let that one go because the songs were catchy. ""Wildflower"" was dipped in honey, dragged through a pile of pixie sticks, and then left out in the sun to bake for a week. What happened to the rock n' roll chick who stomped her way across America on the Lilith Fair tours? What happened to the gritty, depressing lyrics and raunchy guitar hooks that made me oh so happy? I realise that love is a poten, life changing event, and I'm happy that Sheryl is happy - but the music has suffered. There's no denying her status as an icon in the music industry, but this album put me to sleep. I'll leave it in the CD changer for now, but her self titled album and the Globe Sessions FAR surpass this CD as her best."
2,Music to slit your wrists by,"I've always been a big fan of Sheryl Crow, but this cd is just disappointing. Each song seems to blend into the next. There is little variety, nearly all lack luster ballads. Her vocals are very high pitched especially the first 3/4 of the cd and not up to the usual standards. It was difficult to even understand the lyrics on most of the songs. I'm very disappointed."
4,Musical Gems,"Wow! I'm not surprised at the mix of reviews. This certainly won't satisfy the edgier listening styles. This is mature...the songwriting of a grown-up who's not revisiting her twenties and early thirties. Maybe you have to live it (I'm in mid-40's). There are several gems on this cd, with very little filler. ""I Know Why"", ""Perfect Lie"", ""Good is Good"", ""Lifetimes"" (my personl favorite), ""I Don't Wanna Know"",""Always On Your Side"". Some have said her songs are ""boring"" due to her finding recent happiness. I say she writes great songs no matter her ups and downs. This is definitely a keeper, especially for her older audience."
3,Not too much substance here..,"While it made for a good read, if you have any moderate amount of experience in real estate investing (I've been doing it for several years), this is mostly a book on common sense items...I was hoping to see more detail about the individuals highlighted, rather than a brief overview of how they became successful.There are a couple decent points in the appendix regarding valuation and such, but mostly stuff that you should already know if you're planning on buying investment real estate.Overall, there isn't a whole lot of USEFUL information to be gleaned from this book."
2,Fluff,Only 125 pages of actual 'meat.' The rest is 125 pages of 'annotations.'This book is fluff at best. Doesnt do an adequate job of delving into the actual nuts and bolts of how these guys did what they did. And why else would anyone be reading a book like this? Dont waste your time or money.
4,Good info,"Good read and full of usefull info for the experienced and newbie investor. Since there are 4 authors all offering different life experiences and backgrounds, you don't get the ""tunnel vision"" you get from some books where the author can only tell you about their own personal experiences. A little bit like ""Rich Dad"" in the way that it inspires you to think differently, but it also has the routine real estate 101 teaching that you find in almost every book of this type. The book focuses mainly on long term investing (as the title implies)."
1,Skip this one,"This book is not real helpful for anyone looking to invest, develop or get involved in commercial real estate. It is a very quick read that can be finished in a few hours. The quality of the information and the writing style is substandard. The stories about the real estate tycoons in this book are somewhat interesting but in no why helpful or particularly insightful for somewhat looking to get into real estate.It's sort of like the old stock market adage ""buy low, sell high"". That's the rather simplistic advice that you get in this book from the stories of these ""sages"".I have worked in commerical real estate for the past 20 years and am always reading and learning but this book is not really helpful for the novice or the expert.If you are serious about real estate, skip this book and get something else. It is not worth the $$$."
1,Did not work,The toilet was stuffed with paper so it drained very slowly. I tried the product two times but that did not help. Instead I used a plunger that solved the problem in a few seconds.
2,arrived broken,"arrived broken, spilled into the bag. after one email shipper refused to replace. after a phone call and lots of haggling, they did. it sort of works, one needs to double the amount."
2,Failed,"I have a kitchen drain that gets slow. Had it snaked by a plumber a year ago and it has been fine but recently went slow again. In the past i have tried boiling water, acids and plumber. I tried this product, faithfully followed the directions, and repeated process multiple times over a couple of months. No change at all. Called in Roto Rooter and they power snaked the line and it is fine again. I wish I could find a product that worked but it wasn't this one."
4,Works for some problems,There is no one solution for all drain problems but this will clear build up in your pipes. It will not clean out a massive hair build up--for that you will need a snake or lye.
3,Tried this with no good results,"I bought this to help with a slow moving drain, read the directions and followed them to the letter. Used it for an entire week with out any new results. It may be that it only works with certain types of clogs."
2,Bought as gift for someone..,"This was supposed to have been a drain care removal for an old friend, and intended to clean her drain. It was useless and returned."
1,Product photo is wrong.,"What I received was a ""build up remover"" with a completely different label. It was not a clog remover. Someone needs to update this listing."
1,Not for HAIR CLOGS!!!,"I followed the instructions and was left with the same frustrating clog. I found this video to be more helpful: [...] I'm sure the product works well if you have old pipes that are clogged with other types of build-up, but save yourself the money and clean out the thingy in your sink first."
3,This does work,"We have had a slow running toilet for years. First, I replaced all of the tank hardware. That did not fix it. I now own a three foot auger, as I tried that plumbing solution myself, but that did not even fix it. I used the product per the instructions, three days in a row with good success. This product has cleared whatever was impeding the drain, to a degree. We still don't have an optimum flushing toilet (occasional incomplete flushes), but it is not slow like before."
5,Great Set with Lots of Variety,I was pleased with the variety of different things that came with this toy. The extruder works way better than I thought it would which was a pleasant surprise. I also liked that it came with play-doh. This is the biggest set of Play-doh accessories I have come across. It provides hours of enjoyment for my kids.
5,Great Fun,"It's play-doh...so you have to expect that it gets messy. Still, it keeps my 6 year old busy for hours at a time...so I don't mind :)"
2,TMI-too much information,"I am a true fan of the author and that's the only reason why I decided to read this book. The premise got my attention and I think that there's a family that hasn't been touched by mental illness. As for the book, it is way too long and clearly BeBe could have benefited from some good editing. I am midway thru this book and I'm committed to finishing it...no TV to watch due to problems with my cable. There were many opportunities to liven up this novel by developing some the other characters...Clyde, Orlando, PJ and her friends. In the future, it doesn't take over 300 pages to tell a story"
5,A subject so taboo,"An excellent story of a family's struggle with mental illness. A very well written and honest accounting of a divorced mother's struggle with having the not so perfect child. If you have ever read Bebe Moore Cambell's work, then you know that her use of metaphors and imagery are such that you feel as if you are right there in the same house as the characters. An enjoyable read."
2,"Too wordy, too long","The beginning of this book grabs you. The subject is interesting. It is well written. However it seemed that the same chapter was repeated over and over again only with different verbage. I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't."
3,Good start but then went nowhere,"72 Hour Hold started off good but by the middle of it, it seemed monotonous. Trina is ok, Trina is smoking pot, Trina is manic, Trina is missing, her Mom is upset, meets with group people...around and around. I got bored, sorry to say."
4,Excellent intro to mental illness and the flawed system,"This would be five stars except for some clumsy literary flaws. The heart of the book introduces all readers to mental illness, misconceptions, the flawed system, desperation, and the belief that things will eventually be ok isn't always so. The pain of everyone involved is heartbreaking. There are also some one-liners that encapsulate an illness - e.g., depression ""It's a good day when she brushes her teeth."" That is clinical depression. A patient cannot snap out of it as everyone thinks they should or could.The story is interesting and the characters are unusual. Anyone who has the slightest interest in mental health should read this. Actually, anyone who thinks it can't happen to them should read it."
3,Bipolar Disorder,"I think it is great that an author wrote a novel based on a character suffering with the manic depressive demon called ""bipolar disorder."" It opened up in a gripping fashion and then by about the thirteenth page, it started getting boring. It continued to read like this throughout the book--it escalades then it drops off--escalade, then drops off. I wouldn't consider this a pageturning novel because there are some yawning moments, but it is an educational novel outlining the characteristics of this unfortunate disease."
3,...A GOOD BOOK....,"BeBe Moore Campbell does an excellent job at discussing some very real issues that plague our community...the lack of good/restorative mental health care. Being one who can identify with much of what Trina experienced, it was interesting to see how Campbell captured the true essence of mental illness...specifically BiPolor Disorder.I could only give it 3 stars because and only because it wasn't a real page turner. You wanted to read it, but what motivated me was wanting to get to the end...not page turning exhillaration and excitement. It was a good book. Campbell did a good job...it almost seems like it was based on a true story. That is how vivid the characters and experiences were.I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever dealt with a mental illnes; has family or friends that battle mental illness; or wants to learn more about mental illness. It was a needed book. Kudos to Campbell.Peace and Blessings."
3,Mental illness and people of color,"Pretty good book about how we deal with mental illness.Most of us try to not to deal with it, especially if its in your family. Great depiction of the trials and tribulations of dealing with it"
4,3 Days,"I loved this book, I have a family member with a mental illness and this book opened my eyes to what like must be like with his immediate family. This book was realistic and it made you think what would I do? How far would I go?Mental Illness in the African American community is often not recognized and most families are ashamed and don't seek the help of support groups etc.Its a shame that so many people with mental illness self medicate with drugs and get labeled as homeless drug addicts and not the mentally ill.S.WilliamsThe Sistah's of Ebony Pages"
3,A Test of Endurance,"Bipolar Disorder seems to be increasing in popularity in our society. I actually felt sorry for the mother. She obviously loved her daughter because she went to the edge to help her. Although, I feel that this novel would be better suited on the big screen because this book could really only be appreciated by those who have experienced or been touched by this disorder. A larger audience is worthy of this story if only to see the extremes that a good mother would go through to save her only child's life. A 3.5 on the SmithScale."
4,Wonderful book!,"This amazing journey is an incredible, emotional roller coaster of a ride. I was blown away!FYI...Reviewer Phyllis, you may want to edit your review. The main character's name is KERI (guess the book didn't make much of an impact on you!)."
4,72 hour hold,"Though written as fiction, very true account of bi-polar disease. Good support and information for families dealing with loved ones suffering from this disease."
5,awesome,Great! cant wait to visit Katy this summer with my sweetheart!! I am prepared and the book goes with me.
1,"First impression, not enough sound.","I installed the Motorola HS830 Helmet Headset into a new Nolan N42 open faced helmet, using it in conjunction with a Garmin Zumo 550 GPS and a Nokia 6102i cell phone. The volume of the unit is not enough to be heard with my Honda ST1300 at idle, much less on a windy day running at 70 mph. I have put a request in to Motorola's website for assistance but after two days they have not answered. At this point I certainly would not recommend this product."
4,Great Mother Prajnaparamita,"Edward Conze's translation of the Prajnaparamita Sutra in 8000 lines and of the even earlier verse form is still the only English translation of this beautiful and profound Buddhist text. It's a great gift that the scholar Conze devoted his life to the study of Prajnaparamita and made these texts available. For a more poetic and inspiring version of the Prajnaparamita Sutra I recommend Lex Hixon's ""Mother of the Buddhas, Meditations on the Prajna Paramita Sutra."""
2,Problem viewing,"The watch is beautiful but two things, it didn't run (could just be the battery) but the real problem was the way the glass or whatever the clear top piece is made of, it had a glare under the lights at work (my seiko of 10 years didn't do that). I found the shape of the glass to be hard to see clearly at times."
4,Milling vise,"Bought this vise for the following reasons; Low profile in height, small footprint in relation to the size of opening (4 in). accuracy of vise is good. Bought for use on a Grizzly mill that is smaller than a normal vertical mill. This vise allows me maximize the cross feed travel and distance between the spindle and table."
5,wonderful book for an effective change,Kindly pass the below request to the concerned :I haven't received this book yet. Also I couldn't track the consignment with DHL as well.Kindly do the needful. I know this book is very good.Regardsmurali
2,Not as pictured,"When I initially looked at this beautiful accessory, there was a protrusion which prevented the toilet paper roll from sliding off. When I got the item, it did not have the protrusion. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that it never had the protrusion. It's a shame because it matched my fixtures in my bathroom perfectly. I had to return it."
1,Came with wood screws that are too big for the plastic tabs,The product is cheap. The screw holes on the bracket and tabs were unthreaded so they stripped after screwing. Also came with the wrong type and size of screws. Tab cracked right after I put the screw in.
2,Very Disappointed...,"The picture shown does not come close to what arrived in the mail today. I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered these earrings for my wife, based on the price. But I wouldn't have paid more than $5 for the earrings that came in the mail if I saw them at a store. The first thing I noticed was how the Opal lacked the iridescent play of color they are known for. The second thing I noticed was the color of the silver; slightly brown. It does not look like sterling silver; it resembles silver I've seen from mines in Mexico that cause discoloration on the skin. I'll have to check the silver, and I'll be taking a closer look at the 'opal' to see if it isn't really Slocum Stone. The only reason I gave it a 2 is the price and somewhat quick delivery."
3,Wasted premise.,"Alex Crawford spent two years in an Iraqi prison, declared dead by the State Department and all his possessions sold. During the time in prison, only the thought of his childhood home kept him sane. Now Alex has returned home to discover his house was owned by Dominique Bellay. Dominique allows Alex to stay until the law determines who owns the house.Two severely wounded people who find each other. The story was predictable and, despite the interesting backdrop for Alex, flat. There was no real chemistry between Dominique and Alex."
1,The best feature sucks,"The projection on this clock looks really cool on the ceiling. it would be soooo much better if it kept time though. it has to be set seperately from the main clock and for some reason, on ours anyways, it's way too slow which makes the whole thing pointless unless you're just in it to look at numbers on your ceiling. another bummer is the sleep setting. you can fall asleep to the radio only if you want the alarm going off as the radio also. i don't know about you but i don't fall asleep to a radio loud enough to wake me in the morning.did i mention the projection arm hums dearly to me at night? if only it knew a different song.."
1,GPX makes crappy products,I got a GPX CD player for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
4,One of the better sources,"Cusack's book is one of the better books about the Bermuda Triangle. It is a more scientific approach to the phenomenon that has frightened and captured the imagination of millions. Thoroughly researched, Cusack brings to light some of the possible causes of the dissapearances in the Triangle. Unfortunately -- from time to time -- he can not get away from the ""supernatural"" approach to this mystery."
2,a tiresome novel,"In this book, I have a few likes. For example, the examples of planes and ships missing are very detailed and interesting. The book is also very clear and also very understandable when it came to all of the missing planes, ships, and boats.In the book, I do have a few disklikes of this book, eventhough I did also have some likes of this book. When the author wrote the book, he wrote it with a lot of factual information without any action or any type of detailed past-accident details. He did give a lot of details of planes going down, but not how the passengers and planes or boats were doing after the accidents. More post-accident details would have been better.I have a split recommendation for this book. I would definitley recommend this book for anyone looking for factual information about the bermuda triangle. But if you are looking for action, etc. I would definitely not read this book."
5,Beginners Bible - Baby Jesus Flannelboard Figures - Pre-Cut,I really did like this as I bought several boards that go with the Bible that I purchased that goes along with the story. Grandkids love it.Brenda
3,Orphan of Creation,Orphan of Creation had an overall idea that was appealing and interesting. but then the author wandered all around on the subject and it fell apart.
5,"Concerto for Piano Duet Opus 153 (2), Carl Czerny",I just heard this played on Classicfm (21 Dec 2005) and the music and performance are stunning. Definitely a must-have. Details from Classicfm put into Google got my hopes up when Amazon showed a hit - only for Amazon to tell me it's not available :why have it on the website if it's not available ? Most frustrating.
3,particularly good for the gambling-related scenes,"I enjoyed the movie in its own right and also because of the gambling scenes and discussion, a hobby of mine (collecting gambling chips and equipment). I just want to add that I can't think, off hand, of another movie with so much discussion about gambling and gamblers and what makes them tick. There is a huge amount of gambling scenes and gambling equipment (from 50 years ago)..........Another plus is the terrific cast; take a look."
4,A sweet nighttime story for a toddler,"I started reading this book to my son when he was one and a half. He loves it when I read this book to him at bedtime. It has lush illustrations. When it says, ""Roll over, roll over!"" I roll over on the floor; he giggles and has a great time with it. The sounds the animals make they fall on the floor are fun to make sound effects for -- ""CRASH!"". And he always pays attention when the animals are all gone, and the little boy in the story is cold and alone. We've enjoyed this story dozens of times. Recommended."
2,Can't really see what the big deal is...,"I'm afraid I can't really see what the big deal is about this author. I find that her writing style is very long and rambling. Everything feels overdescribed and ""padded"", as if Canham is trying to reach a certain word count. I found this book more work to read than fun. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not just saying this to be different.Canham's writing style reminds me of the writing of the following authors: Laura Kinsale, Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, and Rebecca Brandywyne. You can take that as praise or censure, depending on how you feel about their books. I like fast moving writing, in the style of Sabrina Jeffries or Jacquie D'Allessandro. I don't like feeling like I'm slogging through a book, and that's what Canham's writing feels like."
3,Ms. Canham's Books Not Short on Description,"Another great story idea from Ms. Canham, but it was weaker than The Blood of Roses. The end was too rushed and the middle too drawn out. It was easy to fall in love with Tyrone, however. It was nice to see him soften more as time went on. It would have been nice to get to know Renee a little more deeply. Perhaps we will be surprised with a sequal that will further tell the story. It would be nice to see Renee's brother have his own story as well. I still recommend it, though, because Ms. Canham pays such intricate attention to detail that you can see the characters, the landscape, and feel for the characters."
2,okay,"really, I hate writing bad reviews. Maybe I just didnt give this book a good enough chance...but, I returned it without even getting past the second chapter. It has great potential, really, but, it just has too much dark drama for my tastes.The writing seems good, just too much drama and if thats what you like, then go for it...just not for me..."
5,A Fantastic Read,"This is classic Marsha Canham. I've never read a book of hers I didn't love. Tyrone is one of the most honest heroes I've come across in a long while; and he's absolutely convinced he's no good for anyone, and boy does Renee prove him wrong! She's just perfect for him. She's smart and compassionate; and when she falls for him she holds nothing back. Highly recommended."
4,Pale Moon Rider,"I like the characters, theif with a heart of gold and a heroine that is in character of that period (i.e., dependant on the mercy of men), the story line and it's definitely worth reading. The love scenes are good too!"
4,Enjoyed the read,had a hard time putting it down.Wanted to know what was comming next andhow she would handle all of it and keep her brother safe
4,Great read!,I loved this book. Had me on the edge of my seat in suspense and romance. Great characters. A super read.
2,pale moon rider,A romatic novel with an expected outcome with no twist or turns to the plot. The description of various settings are interesting and easily visualized.
3,it's ok,"This series is not as good as ones like Extras and the Office, but it's ok. I laughed here and there but not as funny as Simon's movies. At the price it was just okay. I guess it would be a necessity of fans."
2,HOPED FOR MUCH BETTER,"Sorry, I just didn't find this show funny at all. And I LOVE Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. So since those two films are a creation of Wright/Pegg/Frost, and Spaced is work of Wright/Pegg/Frost, I was hoping for something as hilarious and witty as Shaun and Fuzz from this show, but the wit, fun and humor just is not there. Pegg and Frost are fine, but ALL the other characters were horrible, especially the morose downstairs neighbor, Brian (Mark Heap). Every time he's on-screen, the show just dies. And the female lead, Daisy (Jessica Stevenson Hynes), is another show-killer. Just could not stand her. Honestly, I just don't know why this show is getting such rave reviews on Amazon. It's really not that good. Nowhere even close to being great like other UK TV comedies like Coupling and The Office. Now THOSE are hilarious shows. But Spaced? Not even close to being hilarious."
5,Best Series Ever?,Yes its good enough to at least consider for best ever... Give it a try its worth the purchase...
4,"Familiar, and Funny","Like many Americans, I became interested in ""Spaced"" after loving ""Shaun of the Dead."" The series is well worth the money, but because so many of the jokes in this BBC series were ripped for use in the zom-com, sometimes it falls flat where it should soar. Wish the series had run longer, but I'll take what I can get."
5,It's unanimous!! 5 stars all around!!,"There's a reason why everyone is giving this show 5 star reviews. It's that good. It was worth getting a region-free player for. And it's worth getting this region one release, as well. I can finally take it with me anywhere to share. It's what I hope more North American tv could be. You could argue that they could have run longer. But instead, we got two brilliant little works of art. Just two unique little series of these characters' situations and daily lives. Each disc is one series, anyway. And it's like two 3-hour movies, full of excellent acting, witty dialogue, and spot-on references, with a happy ending. They are characters that we all relate to - they're us. Or once were. And it's just brilliant. Edgar Wright is one gifted kid. Everyone in it is. But the creative forces just impressed me so. They're clever and talented geeks. 5 stars all the way. A+++++"
5,loving it,"I heard about this series in a magazine, and being a Shaun of the Dead/Hot Fuzz fan I put it in my Blockbuster queue. I bought it after watching the first two episodes...it's hilarious and timely even 10 years later. Since it's only two seasons it leaves you desperate for more, and luckily the shows stand up to repeated, no really ~ REPEATED viewings. You'll be really glad you grabbed this!"
5,Wasted months trying to decide if I should buy this series.,"I finally purchased it this month, and it's worth every cent. What an excellent show, full of orgional humor, outstanding characters and very funny takes on all kinds of films and film cliche's. If you're a fan of Peep Show and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, you're likely to enjoy this show. It's not as crude as Peep Show or It's Always Sunny, but it is just as funny."
5,Better than Fried Gold,Simon Pegg and crew couldn't have done it any better (except maybe add a few... dozen more seasons). The homage-o-meter just adds to the side-splitting humor.
5,The Best Sitcom,"I really don't have much to say, other than this sitcom is... what makes people want to watch sitcoms for. Excellent in every way great writing, acting, and is very inspiring. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great show, and a good time."
5,It's Too Orange-y For Crows!,"All I can say is it's about time! Even Big Train and League of Gentlemen made it out here before this. I have the beat up region 2 copies and can't wait to be able to own the complete series with all the lovely, lovely extras. How will I make it until next month?If you like anything Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have done you will love this show. It's brilliant. Just buy it!"
5,"They're Lightin' up the Cinema, yet they can't get their show on DVD????","I am really really shocked that this isn't on DVD in the US. I mean REALLY REALLY shocked! What on Earth is going on??? This is right up the alley for 'Shaun' and 'Office' fans. We love 'The Office.' We love 'Shaun of the Dead.' And soon we'll love 'Hot Fuzz.' 'Spaced' is even more American than 'The Office.' It's a great diservice to America that this is not in circulation here! I watched the first series literally TWICE in a ROW! I mean, come-freakin'-on! Bring it on, man!"
4,Brilliant British Humor,"See a step in the evolution of the team that brought us Saun of the Dead. In the traditiin of Ab Fab,but not so over the top. Also more widely accessible."
4,Great for fans of British Comedies,"If you appreciate Simon Pegg's other works (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, etc.) you'll love this. Well written and acted with appearances from other famous Brits like David Walliams from Little Britain. Make sure to watch the extras (and there are a lot of them) including out-takes and 23 Meteor Lane revisited."
5,Fantastic and Original!!!!!!!!,"Simon Pegg is a genius and I only wish that this show could have been longer then only two seasons. I don't usually watch english comedies cause they just don't seem to reach American humor, but this really hit the spot. It's a very original and funny show I love it!"
5,It's like being up for three days on speed playing Resident Evil 2!!!,"Seriously, all of these reviews are correct! It is a slice of fried gold! Don't let the term ""Sit-com"" mislead you. This show is unlike anything in the U.S. And that's a good thing! It's witty, relevent and feels like a few days in the life of... Zany yet realistic all at once. It uses the humor of everyday surviving and empathizes with you while laughing at you. Every character is someone we are or someone we know, every situation is something we've been in or seen happen to someone else. Plus it has zombies!!! (In one episode, anyway.) A modern classic! Viva la Daisy!"
5,simply the best...,"There is no series like Spaced. If you are a fan of Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Edgar Wright, you MUST own this series. If you saw this after you saw Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, you will understand about 50% more of the jokes. This series is a definite must-have."
3,Comic book value,"This book lets you know what very few people will pay for a comic book. Dont waste your time trying to get rich off old comics. ""Collectible"" does not always mean ""Sellable""."
5,Stunning Stories of Recovery and Hope!,This book is filled with stories that wrench any parent's heart - and then fill it up again page after page - with new hope and inspiration!These amazing recovery stories are a wonderful testimony to the devotion and unconditional love of unrelenting parents who will stop at nothing to recover their special needs child.
1,Self-Indulgent,I found this book very misleading. I had thought it was more about abusive relationships and how to overcome them - it would be no help to anyone in such a situation. Instead I found it basically a poorly written tirade about the problems this woman had at work Quite frankly she seemed to have been fired so many times its a wonder that anyone employed her again. The radio industry in the last 2 decades of the 20th century was obviously a hard place to work but I really did not enjoy reading about how this woman kept getting laid off. The book hardly touched on the troubles in her relationship or the foundation to help others in abusive situations. Basically it is just a self-indulgent rant by someone who should have got out of that industry and into other sales if she was such a good salesperson.
3,Sleep with the angels,"I found that this book was quite satisfying. Just because all of these other people are being very rude towards the subject, doesn't mean that other people shouldn't give this book a chance. This book was a good story about a woman going through some tough times while working in the tricky radio business."
2,Redundant and homiletically useless,"The introduction/ preliminary chapters are very informative and worth reading. Great information. Unfortunately, it seems the rest of the book merely demonstrates the astrological connections to everything John writes in his apocalypse. I wanted to read the whole thing in order to better understand this mysterious book... no luck.I was very interested to see how they unpacked their division of Revelation which seemed good, but they never really explained it.Also, they reject any allegorical element of Rome, which I think most scholars would disagree with."
3,Some serious oversights,"The book is useful and interesting, but there are some glaring errors that Catholic scholars should note. For example, Malina suggests that the sword issuing from the mouth of the angelic being in book 1 represents a comet. This is downright erroneous. The sword issues from a mouth, that is, it is the double-edged word of God that has a devastating effect on unbelievers. Perhaps the professor should eat some humble pie and go back to Herman Bernard Kramer's Book of Destiny to learn about ancient christian symbolism (its not all derived from eastern cults) and what was really going on in the mediterranean mind of messianic expectations."
2,Not enough flow to be useful,"It is pretty sturdy even though it's plastic. And it definitely regulated the pressure, but it greatly restricted the flow. So if you need to use it for more than a minimal irrigation system, look elsewhere unless you have very high water pressure or don't mind the system running for a very long period of time. I also bought a 25 psi unit at my local Home Depot and was able to get much more flow through that one."
3,Includes a lot of material from first book,"This book hasmany beautiful quilt squares. However, be aware that if you have the authors first book on quilt squares you may want to think about buying this one. About half of the squares are repeats from the first book."
2,Good sound but . . .,they arrived broken. The back hinge is really thin and that is where they are broken. But the sound quality is a good as a pair of Sony headphones I have. I didn't bother to try to get them replaced. Just taped up the back and am using them.
4,Siddons has betrayal and divorce down cold with a great yarn,The tale begins with a perfect portrait of an Atlanta-Club-Lady and moves in for the ultimate betrayal of house and home. This book was like diving in to your next door neighbor's life without the lawyer's bills. Siddons has crafted a matronly tale with a true heroine and leaves us wanting to know...what happened next?
3,It wasn't what I'd hoped for,"This is the first ARS book I've read, although I'd heard glowing reviews of her books for years. I was on the Vineyard last September for a few weeks, and had been speaking with two of my mom's good friends who heartily endorsed the book. When I got back to my office, I ordered the book through Amazon. Although I love the Island and all that it has to offer, I was disappointed with the pace of the book. I did enjoy the character development of Bella and Luz, but wasn't all that sympathetic toward Denny. And Molly, there are plenty of therapists on the Vineyard who can help you overcome your need to help needy people and not yourself.(By the way, last year the large male swan on Mill Pond did hiss and spit at me a lot, captured on film by my husband, but he didn't try to do me major harm.)"
4,"Not her best, but, being Siddons, a captivating story","I am a die-hard fan of Siddons, and my favorites were Fault Lines (maybe because I experienced the Loma Prieta first hand) and Outer Banks. Both had the clear smell of reality in them, and complexity of characters who were *real*.Up Island's main lady, Molly Redwine, is not a very believable character to me, nor is her transformation to a ""Yankee"" from a Southerner. She leaves behind all that she was, and what she gets in return doesn't seem substantial enough to carry the story. Still...I enjoyed the book!"
2,Cliche with bad use of similes,"Normally I don't notice the use of similes in writing, but when she compares pillows to teeth, and says a dream receded like ""a train going away"", the similes jump out and jar me. She uses so many cliches, the worst of which is when a woman who must have been a child in the 1950s says that Dennis Ponder dipped her pigtails in the ink jar. I seriously doubt ink jars were in use in any schools in the 1950s. Also, there were discrepancies that bothered me, like when the one-legged Dennis Ponder is ""running, falling down, then getting up and running again"". I think it would be nearly impossible to run on one leg with crutches. Also impossible was when Dennis and Molly's father brought Luze over from Dennis's camp in a fireman's carry. How is a one-legged man on crutches going to help carry a woman?I thought the endless descriptions went on way too long. I think this book could safely be edited down to about 2/3rds of its length, and be better because of it."
2,A less than stellar book by Anne Rivers Siddons.,"I enjoyed her other books more. I was intrigued by the first half of the book and the struggle that Molly had undertaken, but the last half of the book fell flat. It seemed like the odd characters introduced in that half undermined Molly's eventual realization of herself as a strong woman. I loved the background on Martha's Vineyard but I felt it was also lost in the muddle of the characters' traumas."
5,This was a fabulous book!,"Anne Rivers Siddons has outdone herself in this tremulous story of a family come undone. Her character descriptions are lively and charming, the characters themselves are very vivid and alive throughout the book. Her description of the effect of Tee's sordid affair with a younger woman, and mostly the conflicting emotions that follow in it's aftermath, are wonderful. I found myself truly relating in it's entirety, and I plan on reading more of the author's books. The underlying message I received, loud and clear, was that a family is really just a group of joined hearts, and can be found wherever there is love."
2,Up Island is down for the count,"The book starts off with some interesting characters, one of the best of which is the witch-y, grasping mother, who (unfortunately for the plot and the readers) croaks right when she gets to being nastiest. It reads like the poorest of formulaic shmoozing---you've got your sultry South, you've got your sleepy New England village, you've got your Wuthering ""Heathcliffe"" thinly disguised as a dying creep, who could have been interesting if only he'd done more than WHINE. And you've got your gratuitous, graphic, unemotional sex. Plus, the heroine NEVER SOLVES HER OWN PROBLEMS. Time and again she is rescued by some bystander who plays a minimal role and just comes along with a blast of cavalry bugles.The writing deserved a better story. The story deserved, well, maybe to be drenched in brandy and flambee'd. The only cliche missed was to throw in a Crown Prince of somewhere. Miss it."
2,Interesting story set up unwinds like a paperback romance.,"I was very dissapointed in this book, especially after reading Siddons first few chapters, which expertly depicted a middle aged woman scorned. The portrayal of the ""Eel woman"" is one dimensional and unrealistic. The husband is a pathetic wimp. Molly's life is so boring when she gets to Martha's Vineyard, that I hardly recognized the MV that I know. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen after the first 60 pages, and I am still waiting. Typical of the thought put into this book, Siddons describes her mother as having been both 19 and 22 when she gave birth to Molly; both pregnant when she married and not, and all within 20 pages. Who edited this book"
2,Not impressed,"My mother gave me this book because I enjoyed reading ""Downtown,"" but this one just didn't work for me. I didn't really care about the characters, and frankly thought that they just got loaded down with every problem possible, to the point of ridiculous. But the settings were well described.Wouldn't recommend it."
2,a terrific beginning...,"that just goes down hill from slow to bad to worse. i really loved the authors style of writing in the beginning, actually feeling the emotions of molly, and i guess that could have been because of all the detail that was put into thoughts, sights, feelings, etc. as the book moved along, the very thing that captured my interest began to lose it. a perfect example of this happens when she brings her dog to the cabin and it takes three pages to describe how the dog went from one area, smelling, inspecting only to move on to the next. i believe it was at that point of the book that i stopped reading all the discription and just moved along to the interaction between her and other characters. wish i had enjoyed it more."
3,Why can't she finish a story?,"This is my second Siddons book, the first was Low Country. Both engaged me enough that I wanted to see what happened next.. but the truly disappointing thing is that nothing did. The books end abruptly, as though Siddons was tired of writing and so cleaned it up with a passable ending and finished it. I find it very difficult and somewhat annoying to read over 300 pages and then not know what happened to the main character, never mind 4 of the other ones. I'm afraid I'm done with Ms Siddon's books. I feel cheated, again. If you need closure in a book, as I do.. I'd avoid this one."
4,A good summer read,"I dove into Up Island on July 3, and emerged on July 5 -- not exactly refreshed and renewed, but feeling like I'd spent a weekend with a soul sister. This is the first ARS book I've read, and I love the way she immerses you in both the emotional and physical environment of her character. Yes, I suppose that Molly doesn't qualify as a 90's woman -- she ends up taking care of others instead of herself. But, you know, this seems to me to be a classic kind of mid-life story. Sometimes we do find ourselves by taking care of others. And, the reality for women Molly's (and my) age is that you find yourself bidding farewell: to children, sometimes spouses and parents, and caring for aging parents at the same time. I love the way Molly finds herself healing: slowly, quietly, even as she tells herself, ""I need to really deal with this."" I'll definitely try some of ARS other books."
2,Another selfless female taking care of everyone else,"This was the first book I have read by Ms Siddons and it proved to be what I thought it would be: readable but unremarkable. I enjoyed the descriptions of ""Eel woman"" and could picture her and Tee in their bicylce shorts. Unfortunately I did not see much change in Molly. She just traded waiting on her immediate family in the south to waiting on a substitute family in the north. Can't she find anything else that would bring her fulfillment?"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable...,"I really enjoyed this audio book. The main character, Molly, was a little flakey at times, but overall a very enjoyable book..."
4,Made me go to places I did not plan to go.,"Typical of Siddons, she deals with a woman who thinks that life is stable only to find her world dissolving. She finds a new life and family in an unlikely, remote spot in Martha's Vineyard with aging, dying people. She led me into a better understanding of Lesbian relationships, coping with terminal illness, and the devestation of loss of a mate."
3,Good enough that I'll probably give this author another try.,"I found the early chapters of Up Island, that took place in Atlanta, to be very interesting. However, once the story moved to the island, this novel seemed to drag on too slowly and without much reality."
2,This novel disappointed me as Molly seems unreal/,"To someone who has enjoyed Colony and others by Siddons, this book disappointed although it began well. The character seems sympathetic and strong, but somehow her husband's indiscretion totally destroys her good sense. From someone admirable, she turns into a weak person who uses a friend and wants to lean on others, including a distraught father. The characters of Martha's Vineyard , drawn poorly do not excite interest and the book goes downhill. At points, Siddons does show the inner thoughts of Molly, and that provides some impetus to hope she will wake up."
3,"An entertaining, quick read but nothing that will stick!","I was frankly surprised to see that this book has such a high rating with Amazon readers. I was pretty disappointed by the time I was finished with the book. The only character that evokes even a little sympathy is Molly's father. For Molly, her son, her daughter, her cheating husband and her so-called friends, I didn't have much feelings at all. And there is not much point even talking about that dysfunctional bunch she latches onto ""up island"".It would have helped immensely if we had had a little bit of problem resolution. I also would have liked Molly to show a little more backbone or spirit or determination or something akin to the qualities she must have to be the type of woman we are led to believe she is.Sign me - a 40 year old avid reader"
4,depth beneath the story,"Something is going on here that reaches deeply beneath the characters and incidents of the story, easily missed if one does not pay heed to Molly's early musings about family. She is asking a profound question about what determines our social units: must they be consistent, continuous, normative? Or is there room for the quirky, the alien, the threatening, the dying? In the end she finds a definition of family that defies the reality of loss, universalizes beyond the confines of parochialism, and offers up hope. Are the characters profound - No, not in their individual selves. Is the plot profound - No, not in its specific events. But, if you catch this glimpse of one's own ability to choose the meaning of family, that is profound. And, also if you hear the message that the only way to deal with loss is through the pain, not around it, you get a bonus gift. Earth-shattering ....not really, but provocative for those who open themselves to the meanings beyond the superficial."
3,I'm staying down island,"I have never read Ms. Siddon's books before and I doubt I ever will agin. This has it all lesbians,affairs, death and ;a lot of the F word for no real reason. I listened to this on audio it was a reasonable price so I thought, here is a famous author why not try her book. At first I thought it was a cute story and then it went down hill from there. Quirky characters and the main character Molly finding an off pair who needs someone to feed swan;s. She went and cared for the ladies their son who is fighting cancer and her father who has just lost his wife. All this sounds like the making of a cute story but ends up just silly. The main character is always tired. You can guess that the heroine Molly will fall in love with the cancer patient. Miss this book their are too many good novels out there. Just because it is a reasonable price does not mean it is a good book,"
4,A Good Story,"The story in Up Island is the best part of the book. It is compelling and is the reason I finished it. Her writing, however, was too full of flowery, deep, descriptive phrases. I was getting frustrated with the endless flowery descriptions of the scenery. I was so enthralled with the story, I just didn't need yet another description of the Sound or Bight or any other place on the island. Martha's Vineyard and everything about it is beautiful, but it isn't necessary to drone on about it. The wonderful characters and their stories were enough."
1,An Absurd Nonsence,"This biography is a Five Star Lie, perhaps the lie of the century in Africa! That Andrew Morton is now on a mission to cash big bucks from notoriuos Dictators is utterly disgusting from a British author. Moi and Morton should not be mistaken that this biography will change Moi's tyrannious record in Kenya, for it's already well written and preserved. Morton can now go ahead and write biographoes of other ""Statesmen"", like Serbian's Melosovic and Cuban's Castro. Next he can write Pinochet's biography and Cambonia's Pol Pot as well as North Korean's Kim Il Sung. After all he is a writer whose driving force is fame and money, nothing less!"
1,mooi's gift to history,"I must disagree with rthe reader from Oxford that this is a valuable historical document.It is wholly biased , both in the details that it reveals and those that it leaves out. Moi would like to determine how history remembers him ;he must not be allowed the opportunity."
3,Please the Subject,"An invaluable resource of history on a great leader. However, the author hasn't brought out the other side of Moi - his dictatorial mien!As a Kenyan citizen and knowing how Moi has ruled for the past 24 years, I can see the motive of Morton's book as that of pleasing the SUBJECT in order to capitalise on the situation. Morton must have been definitely compromised, to please the establishment, thus not to write much negative things about Moi's person and rule.There's more to Moi than one can extract from Morton's book. Hoping a future write-up will expose the areas that were left out."
3,Valuable Kenya history but too reticent about money matters,"Peter Kirker's strong comments about this book ignore the fact that it is a valuable contribution to the history of Kenya, and is based on a considerable amount of research among people who know Kenya well, probably rather better than Mr Kirker. It brings out particularly well how dependent the President is on his subordinates, how vulnerable he is, and the ever-present and fissiparous dangers of tribalism in Kenya, as well as showing how multi-party democracy has degenerated into tribalism in disguise. The book is too reticent about some of the dubious contractor finance arrangements that have taken place under Moi's Presidency, particularly the Turkwell Dam and the Eldoret airport."
4,WP Lives!,I purchased the DVD edition with the audio cd included.This video presents a nice look at the past and the only way to travel in my book.Some very good footage of the CZ considering the availability of affordable video eqiuipment at the time.It tends to be slanted towards the WP side of the Zephyr but as the video explains there isn't much in the way of video footage of the CZ in action.Definitly one to have in the collection.The audio cd is a VERY nice little bonus for buying the DVD.
3,Where's Chicago?,"A useful history of the Western Pacific's piece of the California Zephyr. But that train ran a thousand miles between Chicago and Denver that we never get to see. In addition, there is no Colorado footage west of Denver. Essentially, a misleading title for a fun train documentary."
5,"Very, very easy to follow recipes with excellent results.","I have had several bread machine baking books. My general feeling about them , despite having a degree in Chemistry and Engineering is that they were way too hard to follow. Not this book. Add the ingredients in the order specified, start the machine and eat the most delicious bread. I especially recommend the Anadama bread (polenta & wheat), the Maple Oatmeal and the Buckwheat Walnut. I get rave reviews from friends and generally am not able to get through a loaf at work without colleagues stealing a good half of it or more. Best choice for a first book.Also has good descriptions of the grains involved and a fun dessert and a section on savory breads, pizzas, etc.. I like to make the Sage Rosemary bread with two Trader Joe's uncured hotdogs in it. Instant lunch."
2,Pleasant stories targeting YA audience,"Having heard some positive words regarding Rash's writing, I delved into this volume with high hopes. The stories are pleasant and painless, scarcely a ripple of trouble that won't smooth away. The young adult audience targeted by these tales should find them easily palatable and instantly accessible. This work aims slightly South of the reader who feels that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the height of American literature. Adults are advised to move on to Rash's later work."
3,Pretty good for buying on a whim,"I picked this single up because everything on this lable has always been good. It's a really gorgeous track. I have to say though, it could be a little more original. It sounds too much like SYSTEM F's ""OUT OF THE BLUE"". In fact, it sounds a lot like FERRY CORSTEN'S material!! (MAJOR LEAGE? Hey, 'F'! Enough with the aliases!- I'm kidding!) The Transa remix is EXCELLENT! So is the Chris Raven mix! So, if you're a die hard progressive trance fan, like myself, I say get it and while you listen, just think, GOOOURRRRRRYELLAAAAA!! Later!"
4,Great Rock N Roll!!,"I can't believe there's not-a-one review for this awesome CD so I must chime in.Yes most the album is in Japanese but who cares? It rocks fantasticaly hard! If you like The D4, old Moonie Suzukie or the Flaming Sideburnsyou'll like this. Even the cover of ""Love Me Two Times"" (all in English) is one of the best I ever heard. The song ""Bird"" is epic. I see they have a new CD as of 2007 (My Way) I'll have to check it out. ""Noise"" definately doesn't disappoint. Another great hard rockin' Japanese band is Thee Michelle Gun Elephant. I highly recommond them too for those who want to rock in any language."
4,Perfect for Laptop Carrying Case,"Pro: This device is perfect for laptop carrying cases as it is small and fits in the nooks and crannies of case pockets.Con: The device is thin and feels flimsy. When retracting, one has to do it slowly or it will foul causing you to have to extend it to its full length before retracting again.The fouth star is for convenience only; otherwise, I would have rated it 3 stars."
4,Works as advertised,"Product works as advertised. The only issue, hence the four star rating, is that the retracting wheel is set coarsely so that intermediate lengths of cable settings vary quite a bit."
4,Good Charger for travel,I like this charger for my Kindle. It fits in my book cover and is never lost or misplaced. Have given to my grandson for his Kindle also. He his constantly misplacing his charges.
4,It works,It work and is fairly compact when retracted. Occasionally have had problems with it retracting slightly off and not coming back out very easily but not really a big deal.
3,Decent retractable cable,"Purchased to have an extra cable for printer, external hard drive etc. Convenient, portable, love the retractable feature - a bit short; would have preferred at least 3 feet, but doable. Used it to install wireless on my printer and have used it occasionally since then. Not very sturdy looking, but time will tell - cord is on thin side and doubt that this is shielded very well (or at all), but good enough for occasional and portable use. May be better than I think - as I said time will tell."
1,Junk,"First time I plugged it in to use it, the plastic recoil broke. I thought Belkin produced quality products, however, I'm sure they outsourced this production to China. Judging by the plastic casing and cheap construction in general, it's telltale Chinese garbage. Next time I'll spend the extra couple of bucks and get something made in the USA."
3,"Lakota Life, a cultural peek","The culture of the American Indian, particularly his spirituality, has long been of interest to me. I once lived in an area in Wisconsin that had as a neighbor an Indian Reservation which owned a PBS radio station. Much of the Indian, in thie case Chippewa (Obijway) mind-set was openly discussed revealing so much of the soul of these people. This was partiularly true when Pow Wow time brought many old Indian medicine men and wise men of deep conviction who spoke extensively of Indian values and understanding of their creator. This book does much of the same but in glimpses. An in depth study of Indian culture, a snap-shot insight, most certainly. Worth having? You bet."
1,Condition not as promised,"The book arrived in worse condition than described - the pages are separating from the binding toward the back, there is tape on the material covering the cardboard and the book had NO COVER!!! That was not disclosed by the seller either. I would not recommend ordering from them. I expected to receive a book with minor wear and A COVER!!! I would never have ordered the book without the cover."
5,Yerby Fan,"As a long time Yerby fan, I feel this is one of his best novels. The main character's development is better than usual perhaps because it is a followup to The Dahomean, which you should read first."
5,A Great Movie!!!,This is a great thriller that exemplifies the survival skills that Busey is forced to employ as he is fighting for right as well as for his own life. Everyone should see this movie.
3,"Informative, but dull","Unlike other nonfiction FBI books like both Ronald Kessler exposés or Christopher Whitcomb's ""Cold Zero"", this book lays out bare facts about the FBI. It takes you through the process of applying to become an FBI agent, what you'll encounter as a trainee at the Quantico Academy and what areas of the FBI deal with what criminal challenges.This book reminded me of a college textbook. It has great information and lots of detailed pictures with good explanations. But you just can't read this book for long periods of time without getting bored."
5,Awesome book!,"I loved this book. It goes into a lot of detail about an often mysterious career field. Application process/skills, job duties, physical requirements, history of the FBI, etc... it's all there. Since a possible career in federal law enforcement is of interest to me, I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in law enforcement, or who just wants to learn more about the FBI."
5,"Bill , you,ve outdone yourself !","This book , seriously , was exceedingly funny. After I read it , I literally had stitches . The way he acts towards everyone is brilliant . Come experience another childhood with Hobbes , Suzie , Moe , Rosalyn and of course - Calvin's parents"
4,A great book with strips that still crack me up!,"The first few pages didn't quite hook me, but because I love Calvin and Hobbes, I continued reading, and then I found myself really getting into it. I love the way Bill Watterson combines his long stories with his brief four-panel ones. (A bonus for this book was the color Sunday strips, which previous collections didn't have [except the treasuries.]) I loved the long stories in this book, including Calvin and Hobbes' war against each other and then Susie, the reappearance of the time machine, and the first appearance of Chewing magazine! I loved this book, but there was just something lacking that made me give it 4 out of 5 stars. (The title definitely wasn't as creative as Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons.)"
5,Graphic SF Reader,"The days are definitely packed with adventures for this dynamic, but very short duo. From spaceships and interplanetary hideous monster beasties, to creeping around the backyard and generally getting up to suburban kidlet nogoodness, the fun is never in short supply. Neither is the wit, even if delivered under thread of Spaceman Spiff's raygun."
5,GREAT BOOKS!!!,"I love the Calvin and Hobbes books. It is hillarious, that a six year old kid could be so dum, but so funny. I've loved the series soince the first time I read one comic strip of it. I have collected five so far and are trying to get some more. I must cogradulate Bill Watterson on his wonderful work on Calvin and Hobbes."
3,This was a funny book.,"This is one Bill Waterson's good books, but not his best. There was plenty of extremely funny comics in this book, but he has written better. I really like Calvin & Hobbes so I guess I like all of his books. One last thought, I would buy this one."
5,Simply great!,Calvin & Hobbes at they very best!If you do not know the comics it could be a good idea to start from here!
5,I wish I had a stuffed tiger when I was young . . .,"Calvin's wild imagination continues to make these ""Calvin and Hobbes"" books readable. ""The Days are Just Packed"" is the first volume to be published in different formats (pages contain two weekday strips instead of three, etc.). In addition to the change, Calvin's interaction with Hobbes, Mom, Dad, Susie, Miss Wormwood, and Moe are still the same as they were in the earlier strips. Not saying that it's a bad thing; indeed, their conversations and misadventures are so fascinating to read through. But what I really love about ""Calvin and Hobbes"" is Calvin's vivid imagination. I wish I had that sort of imagination when I was younger. But oh well, you can't change the past.Anyway, ""The Days are Just Packed"" should be read by ever C&H; fan that's roaming around on this planet."
4,Crooked Fingers a good record Dignity and Shame,"Fingers leadsinger Eric Bachmann has made self destuctive songs ,and vocally a cross between Neil Diamond and Tom Waits ,a record t attract this chick magnent with new songs about lost love and one about a peeping tom,should be enjoyed in dark spaces and beer to drink."
4,Highly recommended for pediatric clinical workers.,"I am writing about the 3rd edition, which is the most current volume. The only disappointment that I have about this text is that I did not obtain it much earlier. The chapters are well written with many references for further study. The practitioner can keep abreast of the current literature on topics that s/he may already be familiar, or obtain authoritive information about other clinical areas not part of one's regular practice. This text is not written in the style of a dictionary, that is, the reader is given a summary in the style and length of a journal article. The book compliments the older volumes of the American Handbook of Psychiatry for which I have still found much use.I also give strong recommendation for the Social Worker's Desk Reference that is available on Amazon. This latter book is a 2002 text that for some disorders gives a better summary than the Handbook. The Desk Reference is of value regardless of one's clinical license."
3,Is it worth it?,"The strength of the book is that it summarizes the main issues on assessment and treatment quite well. Certainly worthwhile for a quick reference to current opinion on topics but if you're after the finer detail of theory this may not be your book and you might want to try ""Child Psychopathology"" by Mash & Barkley. The question to ask is, is this book worth $170USD new? If you don't mind spending this money then the book is a useful addition to a professional library for advanced students and professionals."
2,No tips included.,"The book makes a nice keepsake but there are no tips included. Don't expect a kit for seating arrangements, budget help, or day of wedding scheduling, or other essentials for wedding planning."
5,Great Planner!,"This planner has it all to get you going on your dream wedding.I got this for my fiancé & she's pleased with my decision. Saves us a ton of money with a wedding planner who only wants to make some easy cash off a bunch of people. The various categories and checklists are what made me pick this out. I've never done a wedding before and we don't have the uppity taste most people tend to go for. Though there are plenty of ideas and suggestions if you would like something ""classy,"" you can simply toss out those ideas or give them to someone else who's getting married. But the checklists are key for us, as we don't want to forget anything...and most likely a wedding planner (a person you hire, not a book), would force that upon you (we watch TV)Overall a great book!!"
3,Not for the Beginner,"If you want step-by-step instructions don't buy this book. While the blurb on the back touts ""step-by-step demonstrations"" they are a very small part of the book and have very few steps. If you are looking for something vague like ""inspiration"" then this book might interest you. It does have lots of pictures done both by students and professionals in a variety of styles. But if you want help with what kind of pencils to buy don't look here. There is a general discussion of pencil types (hard, soft, etc.) but no concrete examples of which is which. You are just told that price indicates quality. Paper/board selection is also vague.If you already know a lot about colored pencil then you might enjoy this book, but don't expect a lot of help with the basics."
3,Great for beginners,"This is a good start for beginners, exercises, technique and examples of other artists' work."
1,Sound disqualifies this Pesek recording,"Despite what may be fine, idiomatic performances of Dvorak 7 and 8, the poor engineering afforded Libor Pesek disqualifies this recording. The strings are not just edgy, they areshrill and bass is deficient. I am giving this CD to my local branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. Perhaps some borrower will find the CD listenable. For those seeking a great Dvorak 7seek out that of Eugene Ormandy and The Philadelphia Orchestra. For Dvorak 8 the path has to lead to George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. Stanley Slome, Granada Hills, California"
3,Good Idea Weakly Executed,"I gave it three stars for ambition, but, unfortunately, the language doesn't live up to the ambition. Also, structurally it's weak, with Achilles dying in the middle and the remainder coming across as padding. The Keats section in particular is attached by paperclips to the prior passages. (They both had red hair--so what? I'm dirty blond, does that make me the same as Brad Pitt? {answer: No})The Keats section came across as, ""Look how much I know about Keats.""Indeed, the contrast between the actual Keats quotations, with all their power, and the fluttering efforts of the author to reach for majestic language is quite telling.As noted in other reviews, there are a few moving or innovative passages, and, ok, I liked the rough sex. But for a truly great modern re-telling of the Iliad, check out Christopher Logue's works."
3,Poem about the hero,"Elizabeth Cook's short novel is actually a poem, full of dream imagery of violence and eroticism. Ulysses draws Achilles up from Hades with a ditch of blood, from which he lures the dead like thirsty vampires. Thetis the ocean goddess makes love to the human (...) in a vast range of substance and form, from fire to lioness. Helen contemplates as the Greeks kill all Priam's family around her. Chiron the Centaur raises the mischievious boy Achilles, who trys to find his sheathed penis. Achilles bears down on Hector and then drags the body for 12 days, yet the body never deteriorates since it is favored by the gods. Priam begs for his son's body and Achilles emotionally moves to the point or stage where he can release the body of the man who killed his lover Patroclus. Elizabeth Cook washes the reader in dream image after image, making Achilles less real with each passage and more archtypal, residing in the unconscious."
5,Nothing wrong with Keats,"The two reviewers of Achilles seem determined to blame it for not being what they want- a full account of the Trojan war written by someone who has no link with a university. I could imagine American readers objecting to British vocabulary and style, since Achilles works best read aloud, but it is churlish to object to the Keats section which closes the book. Keats is the Greekless reader whose proven empathy for Achilles makes him our ally and our model as we find resonance in 'the pain of others, far away on the plains of Troy.' I suggest to your reviewers that this is the crown of the book- the awareness of how remote Troy now is and how crucial it can be to those who can live in the souls of others. Given Keats' admiration of America, surely America can listen to Keats."
2,"alright, but not exactly what I was expecting","It was OK. Short-looking; didnt finish reading it, It just didnt catch my interest and to be perfectly honest, wasnt what I was looking for: a detailed novel of Achilles. If you want something like that, this isnt it."
1,"Redundant, repetitive, pedantic",This book is an exhaustive account of Kafka's life and the culture of the time. Not an easy read as the author restates the same facts and opinions time and again throughout the 760 pages.
4,Restores Damaged Hair,"After several home perms and coor treatments my hair felt like straw and lacked any shine. After 1 week of using this product I saw a difference in the strength, shine and overall health of my hair. Just a few sprays in the palm of your hand and rub it through as you would mousse; it's that easy. It won't leave your hair limp unless you use an excessive amount. It will make it shiny and smooth, help to remove tangles and make your hair smell good. It's a little pricey but the bottle will last for a few months."
1,Reality,What a joke I have never read a book that is so out of touch with reality. I am going to ask for my money back.
1,Might be the most boring book I've ever tried to read,"This could be the most boring book I've ever tried to read. The premise is not to my taste (kidnapped into slavery, Oh Yeah!) The dialogue is stiff, stilted and completely unnatural. The heroine is as dumb as a box of hair. Do not even bother with this mess of a book. Dumb and Boring!!"
1,Did not like it at all,"Like someone else mentioned, this may just be a matter of taste. The premise of the story seemed interesting, however it ended up being disturbing and quite boring. I didn't get the point of it, and certainly didn't understand when it is that they ""fell in love."""
3,Erotica,Not what I thought. It was a pretty good book but a little too much sex. The romance got a little lost.
5,Sensual multi-cultural romance,"Five stars for Jade Lee's White Tigress.Lydia Smith, an English woman travels to China in search of her finance, Maxwell. Unfortunately, she ends up in a Chinese brothal. Cheng Ru Shan searches for his own immortality. In order to reach his goal, Ru Shan purchases Lydia from a brothal for her yin waters.As Lydia becomes sensually aware of her body and longs for Ru Shan to continue his daily exercises with her, she waits for an opportunity to escape her captor. When the day comes, she flees and finds her fiance only to be betrayed by him.You'll have to read White Tigress to find out how Lydia and Ru Shan find one another and have a happy ever after. This is a wonderful heartwarming multicultural romance. A must read!Sandy Levin"
1,Borrrring !!!! How does this get good reviews.,"I read Jade Lee's cotribution to the Crimson City books ""Seduced By Crimson"" and found it to be an enjoyable read so I decided to have a look at her other books starting with this one.What a turn around this book is horrible on so many levels, the characters especially the male lead are not likeble and the premise has no real spark.I am very supprised by the good reviews and I can tell you I will not be picking up any more in this ""Tigress"" series and I doubt I will be reading very much more of Mz Lee's offerings if this is all she has got.Give me Stephanie Laurens or Christine Feehan any day of the week."
1,Boring,I am amazed that anyone would give this drivel more than one star. Page after page of a woman locked in an apartment with nothing to do. How is that in anyway interesting?
3,plastic bead watch,"This watch is very pretty, but the paint covering the plastic beads started peeling off after a couple of weeks, and I had to replace them."
3,The Beatles In Portland - The Complete Story,Definitely for those who like seeing others experiencing Beatlemania. Being an avid fan of the Beatles I am all too familiar with this mindset. I prefer to actually see performances of the fab four. In that reguard this is a collectors item which will spend more time in the collection archives than in ones DVD player.
4,Fascinating Account Of The Beatles Only Visit To Oregon,"Chuck's done a very impressive job of reporting here. Very detailed, thoroughly researched lots of never-before-seen artifacts, rare images, interviews. It doesn't contain the newly found home film of the Portland performance(s), but then again, that's not available anywhere yet. I definitely recommend it to my Beatle friends in Oregon and any Beatles historians. Its very impressive."
1,No Footage,"If you lived in Portland I guess it's OK but for the rest of you, save your money and buy one of the concerts available on DVD."
5,Clever Japan/Salux,"The Good: This product is an awesome one that needs to be sold here in the U.S. It's a great alternative to the brush/loofah. It's like a combination of both! I am satisfied with this product.The Bad: Only complaint is that it is really tough, but it's great for washing the back.And the Random: So gonna get green or something next time, since pink is too girly."
4,Scratchy but worth it!,"I have heard about this product on makeupalley, and because there was such a big hype about it, I went to Amazon and got one to see how it works out myself. Turns out, this thing is really thin, is made up of some scratchy like material, and even is rough when you add soap to lather it on, but I say it is a good product to buy overall. I'm not used to the fact that it is so scratchy like, but I hope like other women, that I would eventually get use to it. I wouldn't ever use it on my face though cause it may cause scarring, and even if you don't see it right away, it may eventually become deep wrinkles and make the skin ugly! I say this product is a must buy for many women, plus to me, its not expensive at all!"
5,The complete opposite of what you probably use now...,"A complete bathing product. This thing isn't ""soft""... quite the opposite. It cleans better than anything else I've ever used. If you shower alone (poor person...) they are great for scrubbing your back- much better than a brush. They're difficult to find, too, but worth the search... We had purchased ours nearly 15 years ago and they had finally worn out with daily use. Oh, and they come in several colors so don't let the ""pink"" deter you."
1,not what I expected.,This is the same as the scrunch complexion scrubbers on a rope. Thought this might be like a microfiber material. Should have examined the picture more closely.
5,One of the best things since sliced bread,"I've been using these things for years. It used to be you could only find them in Japanese grocery stores (or in Japan). I've never understood why Americans weren't aware of it and instead were struggling with lufahs and buying expensive 'exfoiliating' products like those silly round puffy things. This foams up your soap like nothing else, the soap stays caught in the cloth so you end up using less of it to the same effect, the cloth is can be bunched up or stretched to length making it very easy to clean your back. Be warned, this does SUCH a good job that if you don't combine it with a moisturizing soap and instead use regular soap, your skin will feel tight and dry at the end of the wash..... For years I've been buying these and handing them out to friends as gifts. At first they look at me funny till they actually use it the first time and then come to me raving about it.Also, one of these babies will last for YEARS"
4,Smoother skin with this cloth?,I have been using this for months. It feels good to use especially for drier skin types but I don't think it improves skin quality.
4,Great product but here's an ordering tip...,"Order this product directly from the company, TrueRenu. Amazon screwed up my order and charged a HUGE shipping and handling fee. I canceled my order with Amazon and ordered directly from TrueRenu and am a very happy customer. TrueRenu provides excellent customer service and has a fantastic product line. The bath cloth does an exceptional job of cleansing tough-to-reach places like my back and leaves me with great, smooth. blemish-free skin. I have no affiliation with TrueRenu other than being a satisfied customer. Enjoy!"
3,Great shoes for the price.,"I actually purchased these shoes on clearance from a Target store. I think i paid 5 or 6 bucks. With that said, I agree the look is a little cheap, the plastic wood grain makes them look kind of cheesey. But they are very comfortable!! When i first got them i did get a few blisters on the sides of my feet. Once i broke them in they fet and fit great!! I personally can't wear them all day, but for a night out with the right outfit they are perfect!!"
3,Target shoes,"I bought these shoes at Target about 2 years ago! They are cute but the bottom of the shoe really looks cheesy and generic! Cool for a quit getaway in a red sun dress. Other then the cheap look they have, the shoes are comfy."
3,Not Bad....,"Overall, the story was good but what was missing was more character development and relationship background between Delaney and the one she ends up with. The story's end was too abrupt and and epilogue would have been nice."
4,Interesting,"This book started out with a cast of interesting characters, however, early on you could figure out who Delaney would end up with. Jared, Lucas, and Riley all interested in Delaney, lots of side characters that were quirky (her dad, Toby, Susan, Delaney's staff, Rina, the lawyer). It was a fun summer read, went quickly, and had a plot instead of girl meets guy who she doesn't like but who likes her, etc., etc."
5,Another good collection,This collection is nice because it has some old songs. It not a lot but still it nice. My favorite song is Dame Un Beso that is a great song and I am glad they put it on the collection. I think if you just want a nice mix of Selena songs pick up this one.
4,"Great, but simple textbook","This is a great textbook if you want as little detail as possible; it tells you exactly what you need to know and no more. The readings are short and easy. The best part about the textbook is the review boxes at the end of each section. The online access is also a plus because you are able to download and print the figures, which become useful study aids. I would definitely recommend this textbook. It should be supplemented with Pharmacology flashcards or charts, which is why it is only a four out of five stars."
4,great reference,This book is a GREAT reference. My only complaint is that it's not the most up-to-date.
2,Pure fantasy,"Not all ideas are good ones, take this book for example - the premise is pure fantasy. So why not write an erotic short story for one of the national pubs, instead they turned it into twenty dollar book that fits right into my fire place."
2,"This is NOT a ""Dilbert"" book","For those of you looking to laugh at the further adventures ofDilbert, this book is NOT for you! Although Dilbert is on the cover,the comedy that drives this comic strip appears only sporadically throughout the book. Instead, for an extremely high price, you are presented with Adam's sober predictions for the future, which are very, very loosely based on Dilbert. Save your money, and buy one of the other Dilbert books. This book is only for those interested in Scott Adams as a philosopher, not as a cartoonist."
1,yawn... not worth a buy,"In all fairness to Scott Adams I have read onlythe first 1/3rd of the book and this is the firstDilbert book that I have trouble completing.Most of the pages do not speak of Office-roomstupidity which is Scott Adams's forte butis a rambling and incoherent account aboutnothing in particular.The book does not do much of what Scott Adamsis great at -- poke fun at Corporate America.Instead it is a high-priced, fairly thin bookthat recycles some old laughs and tacks on a lotof boring drivel.I somehow get the suspicion that it is morean attempt to cash in on the Dilbert name andfame than an attempt to write a halfway decentbook."
4,Prank?,"Not that this book is ""War & Peace"", but I haven't finished reading it yet...so don't make too much of the rating I gave it. In fact, I was just flipping through it when the last chapter caught my attention. It was very readable, but I have to ask: is it all just a prank? Does anyone know FOR SURE?It's certainly the kind of prank that Adams would pull. In one of his other books, he tells the story of how he posed as a management consultant. The motivation there seemed to be playing with people's gullibility for his own amusement, so I could see him doing it here, too."
2,"It's ok, but does not hold the audience like the Dilbert series",I'm even being generous by giving this 2 stars. Scott Adams is very talented but he should just stick to Dilbert Comics.
5,Grab Your Shades and Step Into The Future,"This is one to keep on your bookshelf. I had to replace the copy I lent to a friend, because the friend wanted to keep it. Scott Adams is his usual, funny self--he seems to have worked where I once did (or maybe he just has spies there?). In any case, most of the book is LOL funny, but I found the last chapter pretty interesting and thought-provoking. It's definitely worth a read even if you don't agree with everything Adams puts forth--and he'll tell you that himself!"
4,The future,"This book is wacky, zany, and humorous. Sometimes impossible, it portrays the picture of the workplace in the future. Workers are non-traditional and sometimes with out-of-this-world attitude. The elderly will have a hard time to accept the would be scenarios. The conversations are not typical of our grandparents' days. A warning to educators and authorities. They have to rethink their policies and programs if they want to avoid a future society like this."
3,Mediocre,"I love Scott Adams stuff, but to be honest this wasn't the best he could do.It did strike my funny bone quite a few times, but it gets a little tiresome and silly. While it was quite funny, some of the humor seemed a bit strained.I would recommend The Dilbert Principle or Dilbert: The Way of The Weasel over this one."
2,Something seriously missing in the humour,"I enjoy Dilbert cartoons very much, but was quite disappointed with The Dilbert Future. Disagree with the other reviewers that this book is ""laugh out loud"" material. At times, I couldn't even bring myself to chuckle. I think the missing element here is the reader's empathy for the topic. Unlike other books such as The Dilbert Principle which deplicts familiar real life situations in an irreverent and hilarious manner that gets the reader nodding in agreement as he laughs, The Dilbert Future is basically a wild conjecture of the future. Without some degree of familiarity, readers won't be able relate to the gags. If you think sex with aliens, microchips embedded in your body, gadgets that enable you not to hear other people speak, is funny, then I suppose this book is for you."
5,Yogurt in print!,"You have never seen a humor book like this one and you may not see one again. It starts off as a collection of old strips, then moves into straight social satire and finally into Adams' very unconventional views on reality and the meaning of life.If you know what you like and just want more and more of the same, this book may not be for you; but if you have an inquisitive mind, you must read it. You won't agree with, or like, all of it but you will have broadened your horizons. I would compare this book to yogurt. It's good for you, you may like it or hate it, but you owe it to yourself to at least try it."
5,"DONT JUST STAND THERE, ADD IT TO YOUR SHOPPING CART.","Its a must!!! A very funny book, which is sarcastic at times, but frightningly realistic...... You Will love it."
2,"Fun, but not exactly a long or thoughtfully wrote book.","This book was very short and not really a book for my age group.( I'm 11) I also read the first avolon book in paper, and its more fun because you get to see the really cool anima drawings in the middle of the chapter instead of at the end when you read it on a kindle/kindle fire.I first bout this book at a scholastic book fair held at my school. At the time I was 9 and the cover was pretty inviting. SO BEWARE OF THE REALLY GIRLY BOOK WITH PINK GLITTERS ALL OVER!!!!!Ratchel Roberts doesn't really write very good books in general so I'm not really shore why I bought this book. I think what if been trying to say is..... wait for it...... DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is only Volume 1,"This is a reprint of Volume 1 of 3 books. Volume 1 only covers Choctaws and Chikasaws. Since I was looking for Cherokee information, I found this book lacking."
4,Great phrase book,This phrase book is excellent to learn or use conversational Hebrew. My only problem is that the font is small and that makes it hard for me to read. I wish it came in a larger size book.
5,"Great book, Amazing Author!","Dr. Bobko is a brilliant man who wrote a wonderful book to help students learn about statistics. Because I know Bobko, while reading his text I could hear his voice in it. This book is more than a text book, it has personality. I learned so much from reading just a few chapters. He does a great job at ""dumbing it down"" for all of us students. I find that many books are too confusing and over the heads of students taking statistics for the first time. I recommend this book to any teachers or students looking to learn about correlation and regression."
5,Templars of Steel!,This album... in it's entirety... is a god-sent! From the thunderous roar of 'Rider's on the Storm'... to the strings and harmonies of 'Dream's Come True'... these artists have created a modern masterpiece. I've loved Hammerfall since I first heard them... but Crimson Thunder sealed my place as a true Hammerfall fan... there's just something completely captivating about the band... every member holds up their respective parts amazingly... the raw music talent... the awe-inspiring composition... and this album represents everything wonderous about them... it sent chills down my spine... an undisputeable 5-star!
2,Worst Hammerfall album till date,"If you have their other albums, keep away from this one. They mantained the lyrical subject, but the music quality dropped a LOT, I mean, A LOT!"
2,"Oh well, better luck next time","I think this is the worse HF album ever. I hate the fact that the songs are mid-tempo and the ballad is just too sappy for my liking. However, Edge Of Honor rocks, Angel Of Mercy is great and Trailblazers is awesome! but that's it. Oh, and Hearts Of Fire is ok too, sounds too much like Renegade though... oh well, we still have the Glory To The Brave, Legacy Of Kings and Renegade. I pray that there next release won't suck as much as this album did."
2,"Their worst album, for sure....","I knew that was going to happen.... Sticking to such a rigid formula by four albums would end in a flop, sooner or later. This happened here with this Crimson Thunder, their fourth album, which sounds almos as pop metal, believe or not! Listen to ""Hearts Of Fire"", for example!RENEGADE was a strong album,e ven with the usual ""templar lyrics"". But CRIMSON THUNDER is a weak metal album, musically speaking. I hope their fifth album is better. Maybe they are taking their time to write more interesting stuff, since their next release was a double live compilation, ONE CRIMSON NIGHT."
2,Avoid,"Time for some excellent silliness from the kings of Power Metal! Oh wait...that was the first album. The quality has seriously gone south on this one. More Europe than Manowar, Hammerfall are treading water badly here. Prepare to hold your head in your hands for some serious cringing at some of these tracks. ""Dreams Come True"" is the chief culprit here. This one would not be out of place in the Eurovision song contest or maybe it's a lost addition from the Karate Kid 3 soundtrack. In fact the last 6 tracks are all duds with only one ot two redeeming moments out of the rest of them. It is a listenable album but the songs just aren't up to scratch. Since when has True Metal been about love and mercy anyway?"
1,Isn't There a way to give this ... zero stars?,"i was already disapointed when i heard Renegade , i thought it was not as POWER as Glory to the brave and Legacy , but it was still Power metal(very poor but still power metal) but this Crimson Thunder really ... , it's almost another band , it almost made me remember some 80's glam bands .... the songs are so boring,basic,pointless(try listening to Hearts on Fire and count how many times Joacim Cans says ""Hearts on fire"" on the song.)As a reviewer said before , the songs just wont stick right away in your mind , really , the songs have nothing interesting to listen to , if you want something cool and POWER METAL buy Glory to The brave or legacy of kings.Dont buy this one,you might need the money for more important things."
2,What happened Part 1,"I was very dissapointed in this release, especially compared to their past efforts. Not a single song stood out on this, nothing different than the 76432714 other power metal carbon copy bands out there. If you're a fan of ""Glory to the Brave"", ""Legacy of Kings"" or even the ""Renagade"" album just end it there, this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band."
5,Let The Hammer Fall!!,"First off, let me say...Wow. This is an incredible piece of work by yet another great of metal. This is right up there with ""Imaginations From The Other Side"" by Blind Guardian and ""Brave New World"" by Iron Maiden. First you get the awesome ""Riders On The Storm"" then bout 2 seconds after thats done, ""Hearts On Fire"" starts. This CD blew me away and it should for everyone as well.Riders On The Storm- A+Hearts On Fire- A+On The Edge Of Honor- A-Crimson Thunder- A++++++++++++++++++++++Lore Of The Arcane- B+Trailblazers- ADreams Come True- BAngel Of Mercy- A-The Unfogiving Blade- A+In Memorianm- AHero's Return- ADetroit Rock City- A+Rock On!!!"
4,A good European metal band....,"They are no Rhapsody...Symphony X...or Helloween...but Hammerfall can make some good music at times. This new album, Crimson Thunder, has some hits and misses. I really like the title song....it is the best on this disc...and one of the best songs of the year for me. The riffs and melodies are so good on this one song....it makes the whole CD worth it. Hearts on Fire is pretty decent too....but Crimson Thunder is sooo much better! Get this CD, but be advised there are better bands out there. If you are looking for a good European progressive metal album, try Rhapsody's LEGENDARY TALES. You'll really like that one too!"
2,Hammerfall going pop metal??!!!,"No doubt this is their worst effort. Nothing like their three other albums. IT lacks creativity, energy. Joacim Cans' vocals seems weary, uninspired. Also, there are some tunes that remind us A LOT of pop metal...This is the order of the best Hammerfall albums, in my opinion:1) LEGACY OF KINGS2) RENEGADE3) GLORY TO THE BRAVE4) CRIMSON THUNDER (well below the others!)"
1,Piece of Junk Poor Company Service No Return!,This table was a piece of junk!! The paint peeled and they won't take it back because I've had it beyond 60 days. It is SUPPOSED to be an outdoor table!!! Do not buy anything from this company like this. The man on the phone was a man with an attitude as well. I spoke to his manager. They will not even send me a new one!
5,Changed My Life,"I got, and followed this book over 10 years ago, and have not had to live in the crazy up and down weight (mostly up) world since then. For over 10 years, I have followed the priciples of this book and been able to stay sane about eating and food through all kinds of difficult life situations - pregancy, death, divorce. It taught me how to live without using food to get through things, and how to live without being afraid of food, either. It was pretty hard the first 3 months or so, but SO worth it! I would recommend this book to anyone who is completely fed up with yo-yo dieting and the guilt and remorse that come from feeling out-of-control with food."
5,Amazing Book,"This is a to the point book about compulsive eating. It's straight forward style & the author's personal experience with the subject make it a truly helpful book. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they may be a bit compulsive with food , or ""use"" it too much to comfort themselves. Fantastic, practical & truly helpful."
5,Highly Entertaining for the Whole Family,We got this DVD set for Christmas '08 and have not stopped watching it! My 3 1/2 year old requests it instead of Dora or Diego. It is very entertaining and the footage of these animals is incredible! There are animals on here that I have never seen before (guess I hadn't seen it all at 38!). We highly recommend this for hours of enjoyment and educational fun.
3,Very good article but poor quality DVD'd (audio),"I bought this documental article because I like to learn more about earth and sea. I received it in very good packing, the dvd's are very clean, the point is that the first DVD of the blue sea I had problem to see it in my home theater and once I could, the audio was terrible. I called to the vendor to see if they can replace it and until this moment I have not received answer from them."
5,Planet Earth / Blue Planet - what a wonderful experience,"This is a great gift to yourself or to someone you know that would appreciate this type of grand panoramic view of life on our planet. Both educational and entertaining, it is a must see... the British version is the best!!!"
5,Outstanding,"Sent these two series to my brother in Seattle and he's simply thrilled by them. There are so many breathtaking moments in these films that you cannot fail to be moved by what you see and learn. One can't help but feel proud to live on a planet so diverse and so extraordinary. You will find yourself walking and raising your gaze, beyond the buildings and the rooftops, for a glimpse of the natural world that you'd otherwise bypass every day."
5,MUST SEE PRODUCTION,"If you enjoy the Discovery Channel this is a no brainer. This is the best production of nature to date. Cinematography is Academy Award epic material, awe inspiring photography. You see places that are remote, rare for people to ever see and above all PRISTINE. You will enjoy hours of EYE CANDY and learn alot about nature in the process. Only downfall is the narrator at times can be on the boring side. I would have used several voices and not just one narrator. Worth every penny. Thumbs up!"
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"Planet Earth and The Blue Planet are a must for every household. There is simply no better video or photography in such a well organized format. Well worth the buy, especially for teachers. You will not be able to turn it off!"
1,"Great series, but commercials are annoying","The series is great, but why do they put commercials on the DVD?I PAID FOR THIS. There should be NO commercials.So for that I have to rate this down."
4,Planet Earth is great!!!!!,The series is amazing but some of the dvds skip. it was an unopened package so i'm not sure why but it was disappointing.
1,Good Series But Some DVD's Are Defective,"Planet Earth set was excellent but Blue Planet Seas of Life set had some problems. Special Collector's Edition was a disappointment because 2 of the DVDs were defective; so, I sent them back for a replacement. The replacement set now had 3 defective DVD's (unreadable). Amazon did very well in replacing the set, but people in charge of quality control had to be ""out to lunch"". I was forced to ask for a refund."
5,Fantastic!!,"When my family and I decided to open this up and watch a little on our new TV, we weren't expected to be absorbed for about 5 hours straight. We marathoned this over a weekend and loved evvvvery minute."
5,As advertised and as recommended,"I saw this product recommended on Oprah and when talking to a friend she also recommended Planet Earth. The photography is fantastic in both series. Being up close and personal with the different species of sea life in the Blue Planet was really exciting. The information is great for any age and is a learning experience for all.I would heartily recommended both DVD's to anyone interested in learning about our planet! Even if you hae seen the BBC series on the Discovery Channel, this is a GREAT addition to your DVD collection!"
5,Awesome,"I got this for my boyfriend and it was the perfect gift. He loves it. There are so many discs and it is so interesting. The video is breathtaking, there are so many amazing shots from a great white shark jumping out of the ocean to going deep into unexplored caves."
5,Great together,"I love BBC's nature shows, and this is such a great combination! After having watched them all, I still like to put it on the tv to have something pretty to look at while I'm cleaning or whatever. It's also very good educational tv if you have older kids, but I wouldn't reccomend it for the little ones as it does show animals eating each other, sometimes pretty graphically."
1,Waste of money,"The description of this item is quite misleading. What a waste of $1.50. You can find more information on Wikipedia regarding Locus of Control (about ten times more) than you're ever going to find in this incredibly brief text. I would go through customer service to ask for a refund, but I'm afraid I've already taken up more time than the dollar fifty is worth to me."
5,Jazz on a button box!,"Great album. However it is NOT a LIVE recording. These are humble studio sessions, and alternate takes are included. Dance music of the era, fox trots, watzes, etc. Very melodic, with Gus's box featured along with violin, clarinette, gypsy guitar, and sometimes drums and horns. Some wild solos by Gus show why he was called the Django of the accordian."
4,"Worthy, but not his best","Gus Viseur and Jo Privat are the two real giants of French swing accordion, and ANY Visuer release rewards attention. But this is not his best work. The accompanying musicians are kinda pedestrian, and if this were all you'd heard of him, you might not be enchanted. Amongst what's available as of mid -2008, for the best of Gus' early years (to about 1942) you'd be better off with his ""Compositions 1934-1942"", whilst for later cool jazz of the highest order, try ""De Clichy à Broadway"" (recorded 1955 & 1962) - you'll be so glad you did.I love this here album, of course, but then, I'm a fan of most everything he ever did."
3,Teacher Talk,This item was a little worse for the wear. But it arrived in due time and I was able to see what type of textbook it was. We did end up choosing the most recent version of this book for our classes. It is a little old-fashioned. The pictures are dated but the content emphasizes public speaking. The various types of speeches are sequenced in a logical manner and it has very good worksheets and quizzes to accompany the units.
3,"Missing The Old Kovenant, But It'll Do.","This album is okay. You can tell by previews that it's not typical Kovenant. It certainly doesn't hold a candle to Nexus Polaris or Animatronik (Two of my favorite albums of all time.) I'm very hopeful in respects to the new album because I read that it may be more like the older stuff. As far as I'm concerned, Animatronik was the absolute perfect mix of industrial and metal. This album is too industrial for my taste. Is it good or not??? Of course it's good! It's the KOVENANT!"
3,Not even close to Animatronics,"I really need to give this a second listening to, but on first listen, I didnt care for it! it was ok, but every song sounded the same, and it sounded like a bunch of slow-billy idol-80's rehack [music]!! really sad considering this used to be a gem of an underground band! Get the ""Animatronics"" album instead!... I'll give it a couple more tries, if I change my mind, I'll change my review"
4,Not Bad but could have been better,"I've listened to The Kovenant since they were Covenant and I've alway liked the direction they have taken, but this albulm threw me off a little. The metal edge on the industrial rock has been dulled down a little. The rock feel watered as well, and the industrial element throw into the front line up but slowed down and a little disapointing. A good amount of the songs are done well but not if you were expecting to hear something a little more aggressive. Good on it's own but as a progression of albulms it's kind of a let down. Don't get me wrong the Kovenant is still one of my primary bands but let's just say I'm looking forward to the NEXT albulm."
2,This is Metal??,"I bought this cd a few days ago expecting a metal band. This is definetly NOT metal. Its packed with electronics and nu-metal like riffs. Most of the songs sound the same and the lyrics are somewhat robotic...literally. It sounds like a robot is singing. There is no screaming, growling or even yelling...just a robot voice. If you're looking for intense, fast, complex music this is definetly not for you.Best Song: Via NegativaOne Word Review: Odd"
1,If you liked the fast stuff stay away from this,Im a huge fan of animatronic and seti is.... well seti is pretty bad. They went completly industrial which I think is cool but their style has become that of [another group.] The music is very slow the voice is no distorted very much and the album in my eyes just isnt very good. If you like the slow songs off of animatronic you might like these songs but be prepared there are only two songs with any energy
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","Normally I like change in a band. But this band changed EVERYTHING I liked about them. I LOVED his evil voice, and the fast, catchy riffs. They were like a combination of Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, and Rammstein all mixed in one. But with Seti they changed all of that. PLUS the copy I got didn't have the bonus tracks on it, which was the last straw. I took it back and got ""Old Man's Child's - In Defiance of Existence"" which is a much better album. I STRONGLY suggest getting that one instead."
1,"Good Sound, Terrible Durability","I've now gone through three of these Jabra headsets, and while the sound quality is fine (both earphone and microphone), every one of them has suffered from the same exact problem - they can't take even the slightest tug on the wire, for instance when I accidentally catch it on a doorknob or cabinet handle, without ceasing to function. Even when there isn't any visible damage, the wire inside the sheath is obviously broken, because the headset no longer works. Keep in mind that I'm not talking about ""strong"" pulls on the wire, just a momentary tug as I walk past a waist-high cabinet with my phone in my pocket and the headset on my ear. These things should be far more durable than they are; it's frankly pathetic. I'll be looking at other brands from now on."
1,listening was fine but terrible microphone,"I bought one of these knowing that Jabra is regularly a great company with fine products. However, this must be their bottom-rung of headsets because my wife, friends, customers could just not hear me lousy microphone!!!However, the earpiece worked just fine and I could hear them just fine.I have since thrown this away and hope Jabra stops making such a cheap piece of junk as it doesn't do honor to their normally good name."
3,Jewish Disaster,Jewish DisasterThe book I read was King of the Seventh Grade. The book is about a boy named Vic who is thirteen. Vic hates Hebrew school he insults and annoys the teacher. The teacher sends Vic to the rabbi who has a meeting with Vic&#65533;s parents. Vic and the Rabbi find out the worst or the greatest news of Vics life. When he has to make the biggest decision of his life he has some troubles. Will the outcome of the story be a good one?I did not like this book because I like books with a lot of action in it. This one had nothing I like in it. I have not read anything in comparison to this book.
1,Incorrect Image,"This Item should show an image of an AVON tire, but it has a License Plate Trim bracket instead. Amazon, please correct this image."
4,New Insights for Old Knowledge,This book opened my eyes to new perspectives on the Saints that I thought I knew all about. This coupled with the creative writing style of the author made it a book I decided to read twice!
1,DISAPPOINTED,"The time and money spent seeking wholesome entertainment was not well rewarded with this purchase. BREAKING THE PRESS was filled with immodesty including the ""mother""/""wife"" of the main characters and too little foundational substance. Breaking the Press is NOT A SAFE MOVIE and certainly DOES NOT exemplify the christian values I hope to be modeled for my family!"
5,Excellent -- A must read!,"Dr. Wayne Dyer has done it again with this phenomenal book on how you can attain ANYTHING. This is, by far, the best book on manifesting that I've read. Unfortunately, many modern folks lack the true meaning of Dr. Dyer's work and think it's either muddled New Age misconceptions or a contradiction of true spirituality. However, Dr. Dyer teaches that abundance is true to spirituality and God...And he shows you how to get anything and everything you have ever wanted. Excellent and one of his best!"
4,Success,"I haven't read the book but I listen to the tapes and I love it. Because unlike what others say, Wayne makes being successful and wealthy very comfortable and relaxing, you don't have to compete with others, it is not a race and you don't have to bring someone else down to bring yourself up. You can actually enjoy your life while being successful."
1,Very boring and condescending book,Dyer thinks he's God. I'm tired of his constant criticism about everything and everyone. Now in this book if you want to look young or lose weight you're selfish and a bad person. Then in his lectures he says you can reverse time. He says whatever he wants to make money and I find him a hypocrite. Every principle is that he writes if from some great enlightenment in his life. Why didn't he pay the Catholic Church for stealing St. Francis' prayer. The catholic church is not happy with Wayne Dyer and that's something you can research on the net. He takes what he wants to make money off of innocent people.
5,This Works...,"I bought this book along with ""Meditations for Manifesting"". Together, these two items are powerful. I read the book every night and practiced the meditations morning and night. Within a week of starting both, miraculous things started happening in my life. Books and people started showing up that lead me to my current home-based business and on to being debt-free and financially secure. It can work for you too. Follow Dr. Dyer's suggestions and meditations AND trust ...it does work."
5,More oustanding work from Wayne Dyer,"This was my introduction to Wayne Dyer. He has a gift for relaying information in simple, easy to understand terms that clearly get the information driven home. This was a wake up call for me and it did in fact help transform my life. Many claim to transform and enlighten but Wayne Dyer delivered. I strongly suggest that if you want to be inspired and effect change in you're life, listen to this program. This will assist you in understanding our true spiritual nature and the power that is inside of each and every one of us. It helps us access the power and effect the changes we desire in our lives."
4,Pretty good so far.,"Still reading this book. There is a lot to digest and sort through. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Ancient traditions in a modern world,"I have been a loyal follower of Wayne Dyer for over 25 years and subscribe to his philosophy of life. This is the first CD I've purchased and I use it for my daily walks.Some of the material is repetitive but he builds on old ideas and introduces some new concepts. As always, I find Dyer a gentle teacher who uses ancient ways with modern application. Not in your face or too intellectual, Dyer promotes self esteem, takes the judgement out the desire to suceed and acquire money, and provides simple steps for a busy schedule.I find that even if I don't follow all the steps to the detail, just applying some of the suggestions improves my life.Certainly worth the $15!"
4,manifest your destiny,i first read his book sacred self and it gave me such peace so i decided to buy others. hope to use it to help others
3,Good Stuff but the presentation is disappointing.,"I am comparing my review with some other books I have read on manifesting. The books I like best are by the authors- Fengler/Varnum. Who wrote: Manifesting Your Heart's Desire and Opening to your Higher Self: Manifestations of the Third Kind. They talk about the same principles but I can relate so much better to what they are saying. All of their work comes from a group of people, they put together, who are working with these spiritual principles in their everyday lives. It's one thing to be in ""trust"" and another to be in ""trust"" when you are trying to heal cancer! I learn so much when I see how other people who have to deal with the everyday world, thy to integrate these principles. They also have a Web site. I don't remember the address but I found them by searching ""manifesting""."
2,Had a hard time with this one,"Interesting part in the book was the part about how to meditate.It may be a good way to work away stress in this very stressful society.I still need more science. It seems Dyer is working too much from a strategic formula in his books rather than speaking from his heart. He would be better off speaking from his heart and talking about those who disagree with him. I wish he would express more emotion in his book..he always seems so ""Spock-like""...and with Ben Stein type enthusiasm, I can only give Dr. Dyer two stars on this one. Hope your next books are moreambitious, not just preaching to the new age crowd.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
4,"Good Product, Slow Shipping","Shipping promised by Amazon in 5-7 business days, company waited over 15 business days to send while product was in stock"
1,spiritual charlatanism,"I see this mindset everywhere... Prosperity Gospel. I find nothing wrong with using what you have. But going after things for pure financial gain and ignoring larger needs, turning your back on others... it is sinful. Sure, you can have a healthy self-esteem and positive relationships, but the focus of your life should not consists of entirely YOU and what YOU WANT. We need fewer spiritual brats in this world, demanding gimmegimmegimme of their gods.See below:The Year I Got Everything I Wanted: A Spiritual Crisis"
4,very wise.,"I love this tape. It is interesting, gives a person much to think of, and does not make excuses, but says why we do not get what we want.It gives us information on what we can do, change, to move beyond our attitudes that prevent us from moving forward and manifesting what we need and want. The meditations are unusual, but make sense too.Thank you Mr.Dyer. This was needed."
5,Truly a masterpiece,"Dr. Dyer is truly a genius, he is able to take the Vedanta teachings from the East and expound them so eloquently to suite the western life style. I have read most of his books and listened to some of his lectures, 'Manifest Your Destiny' is truly a masterpiece."
5,"Full of Magic, Puns and Unique Characters","This book started out as easy reading - comprehensible and not much to the story line. As the book progressed, however, the plot became more detailed as more and more characters were introduced. I would recommend the reader to definitely have a strong imagination to picture the intricate objects explained in this book, as well as the scenery. I found this book to be most enjoyable; I read it in only three days. I definitely look forward to reading more Xanth books, this being my first."
1,WARNING,"She's an old lady, so you shouldn't care too much about the pitch (=intonation). In german: Sie mag ja eine große Jazz-Lady sein, aber leider trifft sie den Ton nicht mehr. Vorbei ist auch daneben."
1,Telescopic Wand broke within 6 months- buy something else!,"This vacuum performed well for the first 6 months, when the height adjustment to the telescopic wand broke.So the handle extends and contracts as you vacuum. I called the manufacturer and they said this was not covered under the warranty. I have been waiting for a month now for the replacement part, and received notice today that it will be another 3-4 weeks before it comes. Ugh! Buy something else. Poor customer service and warranty!"
2,Go with the Dyson!!,"This vaccuum worked great for the first 2-3 months, but now it won't pick up anything, even after repeatedly cleaning the filters, etc! I find this so frustrating!! I tried this and the Dyson. I liked the attachments for this vacuum and the ability to get into corners and tight places. The Dyson was more difficult to manuever when using the attachments. However, now I am wishing that I stuck with the Dyson!! Don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing this vaccuum!!"
1,A waste of money...,"What does it mean when you buy a product which says in bold white italicized letters, ""NEVER LOSES SUCTION"", and it does? Is it false advertising? Sure seems so to me.I own this little marvel, and purchased it based on those three little words. I feel cheated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Good vaccuum but a little flimsy,I have 6 cats and a dog in my house and hardwood floors throughout. I love the fact that it is possible to almost entirely break this vaccuum down for cleaning. It is light weight and has awesome suction and reach with the handle/hose. I only have 2 complaints: 1) the top section with the cyclone technology (a bunch of little cups that fill with dirt and hair that have to be cleaned every other time it's used) took days to dry out enough to use it at my house. I don't know why that is as other people seem to have theirs dry out overnight. 2) the handle broke within 4 months of owning it so that it didn't stay extended.The only reason I'm looking to replace it is that my cats decided to use it as a litter box when I had it disassembled for cleaning. We will probably buy another one as it is the only vaccuum my wife and I found that had all the features we both wanted.
1,Crappy,This thing should really be $40 not $200!!! Its just cheap and weak. looks great which is why i give it one star instead of zero :)
1,Please don't buy this!,"I bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond. It was one of 2 vacuums that I could use for my carpeted stairs. It was AWFUL! The damn thing kept falling over on me and it was heavy to lug up and down the stairs. And as far as for pet hair pickup, it was a joke. It missed so many things that my cheap upright bagged vacuum would normally pick up. It was cumbersome and not easy to use. I just want to vacuum my damn stairs. Why is it SO difficult to find something that works?? I packed up the damn thing and I'm going to return it tomorrow. I'm so disgusted. Because they advertised that it's great for pet hair pickup on the exterior of the box, I fell for it. Don't be an idiot like I was and buy it because of that. It's a joke. I'd like to stab the person that put this POS together in the eye."
1,DO NOT BUY,"1. Poor Construction, Telescoping Wand does not attach well.2. When carrying by the ""Carry Handle"" The canister sometimes releases from the vacuum, due to poor manufacturing.3. Do not Clean cyclonic chamber with water as described on pages 7 and 8 of the manual. Water can get trapped just below the rubber seal and not dry out for over 4 days. This makes the vacuum useless and dangerous.4. Customer service is poor. No response after 4 days. Called and was told to by a new cyclonic chamber ($45), have owned for 4.5 months. Warranty only covers the motor.Don't waste your money."
2,Monster,I have had it for a year now. It really picks up dirt but is not user friendly. I have very small rooms and with this thing I have to move everything. I want something quick and easy to use. I to am very reluctant to dish out more money for a new one but I really hate this vaccum. Because believe me you will avoid vaccuming. When vaccuming carpet it is very hard to push and I have burber carpet. It has great suction but is a monster to use. I am leaning toward getting a Shark Navigator.
3,Gross,"The suction is decent, i have had it for almost 2 years now and it works pretty well. You have to clean it often and you have to go over the same spot back and forth for a while to actually pick up as much dirt as other stronger vacuums, you also have to clean it pretty often and wait until the whole thing is dry before using it. And when dirt gets into the chamber i have to STICK my hand in it and pull all of the dirt OUT, making my hands full of dirt, so gross!...It doesn't clean under my bed so I am looking at other vacuums that are more versatile, not an upright. I set it at the floor setting to clean a low carpet, and its so hard to pull back and forth, just a pain."
2,Great at first...,"I thought this was a great vacuum at first. Strong suction. Picked up everything (cat hair and all). I was amazed at how much it did pick up. I have hardwood floors as well as area rugs in my house, so I was looking for a vacuum that will work on both surfaces. It did for the first 7 months.I have cleaned all the the foam, filter and cyclones when it stopped working...I used it twice after that and it stopped working again.It didn't even last for a year and now I have to look for another vacuum. Very disappointing."
1,THIS SONG IS SOOOOOOOO TIRED,"SORRY TO BREAK THE LITTLE ""5 STAR"" STREAK, BUT ALL STAR IS GETTING REAL OLD REAL QUICK. SURE, IT WAS COOL WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT--I LOVED IT JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE. BUT YOU KNOW, AFTER HEARING IT ABOUT 5 BAZILLION TIMES, SONGS TEND TO GET JUST A TEENSY BIT OLD! ITS NOT THE ARTIST'S FAULT, SO DONT THINK IM TRASHING THEM. ITS RADIO'S DOING-THEY PLAYED IT OUT."
5,WOW!!,"I love this song!! All of my friends and I always get up and dance and sing... this song would make anybody dance, I love it!"
5,Why aren't there ten stars for the best song in the world?,"I heard bits of this song first on the Mystery Men commercials. Then I heard it in full on a television show, and it was love at first hear. I've always got this song in my head (that's not a bad thing) and I know all the words. Fine job Smash Mouth and keep making more good songs."
1,"Uggh, this song is so baddddd!","God, my brain started to hurt and I had to take five Tylenols to get the pain away! The vocals are just bad, while the beat is non-existent! I wouldn't buy this if you paid me to! I'd rather hit the ground running over and over than listen to this song even once! Worse than even ""Freak on a leash""! :("
3,For very intrepid and/or advanced knitters!,"Admittedly, I would characterize myself as just-barely-past-beginner knitter, relying more on fabulous yarn than on intricate stitchery to create dazzle. This is probably why I found the charts' and knitting directions' complexity terrifying. In the inspiration department, you will like these pieces if you are attracted to classic shapes, complex, lacey designs, as their origin from past Knitter's Magazine would imply. For myself, I would have liked to see some more avant-garde designs included - the brief history of the shawl was interesting, but would have been made more so by including some modern pieces in the gallery."
4,shawls and scarves,"I have made several of the patterns in this book, so to me this is one worth having. Some lovely patterns in it."
3,Watch out for the Faroese pattern!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the learning portion of this book, and planned to knit the Faroese shawl. Fortunately, I belong to a sock knitters blog and someone who knitted this shawl warned everyone that it was riddled with errors! I still enjoyed many of the techniques that is shown in the book. But I'm understandably concerned about the accuracy of their patterns.....Katie"
1,Too short,"When I purchased these, the product description didn't state how long the wicks are. So, I took a chance. I received 12 wicks; but unfortunately, they are very short in length."
5,"A ""must"" for AIC fans.","A super album of AIC best and a great new song ""GET BORN AGAIN"". Is there any hope of an AIC tour?"
3,Newer != better,"After a long wait, this new single didn't really deliver like I'd hoped, but the AIC sound is still there, that strange vocal tone that only Cantrell can seem to produce. Not so sure about the music behind this one though. Definitely look to the older stuff instead."
3,So Salty,"The soy nuts I received say ""salted"" on the packaging. Boy are they ever! I am considering washing them before I eat them."
1,millstone coffee (ugh),"This coffee has absolutely no taste! The problem is they only sell them in 6 bags of 16 count pkgs, so I cannot even return the unopened bags."
4,I love these coffee pods!,"I am again delighted with the quality of the Millstone Colombian coffee pods. The pods are much harder to find than when I purchased my coffee maker, but I can always count on Amazon to carry this brand. Millstone is the best pod I've used, and hopefully will be able to continue using. The coffee is rich and very flavorful . . . closer to coffee shop coffee than others I've tasted. The pods work in my machine which is a Juan Valdez brand, so I'm assuming they will also work in others. The only down side to this purchase is that the price has gone up $3 since I last bought them. I was hesitant to buy them at this price, but decided it would be worth it with the quality of the item."
5,Millstone Coffee Pods,Very fast service at a reasonable price. Would definitely do business with this company again.
4,Love this Coffee,"We have tried other coffee pods but the Millstone Columbia Supremo coffee is really a good coffee. Also we have found that every pod is has exactly the same flavor, unlike some other brands we tried."
5,Works with my Gibson EB3,I bought these in hopes they'd work with my old original Gibson EB3 bass. They work perfectly as pickup screws. (Of course I had to take apart a couple of pens to get the springs I needed.)
2,"The drive seems fine, but the software is horrible","The drive seems to work perfectly fine. But the software that comes with it is awful, and won't seem to run properly on either XP machine I've tried to install it on. The software is the type that puts a gratuitous, useless skin on top of what ought to be dead simple functionality. Half of the buttons are missing or unclickable, the backup function doesn't seem to run, etc. To make things worse, the server also has a web interface, which has some of the same functions as the desktop software, but not all of them - and changing a setting in one place seems to have no effect on the other, leaving me totally in the dark as to what the actual settings now are. I'm now looking for an alternate backup solution - all I wanted was a simple drive that would do its simple job of backing up my files without fuss or complaint, and while the hardware seems to fit the bill, it's a shame they package it with a more or less worthless software interface."
1,EasyManage Software Issues,"The drive itself works as designed and is easy to setup and manage.The EasyManage software has tons of bugs. When I contacted technical support they were no help. They told me the problems were with Vista. I installed v4.1.0.15 which according to the support site was specifically released for Vista. Also the backup software does not support backing up .pst files. This is one of the main reasons I bought the drive. When I asked why .pst files were excluded the technical support person told me that ""it was not designed to backup application data""If you don't care about using the backup software or Vista compatibility this is the drive for you."
4,Teletubbies forever,"My grandchildren and I miss Teletubbies on TV, so we're glad we can still find dvds of them."
4,Pretty Good,This is not mine nor my kids favorite Teletubbies movie. It is cute and they will watch it but my son will ask for one of the others over it everytime.
2,Not so great,The first half of this video is the Teletubbies parading in front of a blue screen. At first my daughter was intrigued by the multiplying Teletubbies but soon lost interest.Twenty minutes or so later came the live action parts and that was a little better for her. Still the only part that she liked was when the Tubbycustard machine started making bubbles.I think that there are probably better DVDs out there to get instead of this one.
5,Stage Manager's happiness,"When I purchased this product, it was for a friend of mine, who really wanted it. Upon getting it in the mail, it looked interesting. When I gave it to my friend for Christmas, she was uber happy and excited. That--is a great thing. She's told me that she's referred to it on occasion while she was an assistant manager recently."
2,Only brought it because it was required,This book was required for school. Shipper was great and I received it in a timely manner.
4,"Easy, Optmistic Textbook Reading","This textbook was assigned for my 3000-level Concepts of Professional Nursing class during the first semester of my BSN program, and like the class, the book seems optimistic and simplified. The class is set up as more of a round-table discussion with colleagues, rather than students & professor, and the book is well-suited for it. The major concepts are noted at the beginning of the short chapters, and are addressed in the order presented. So far, so good for assigned reading."
5,Leddy & Pepper's Conceptual Bases of Professional Nursing,This book came quickly and in mint condition. Want to learn more about nursing theory? Be sure to purchase this book - a great resource.
1,Nursing Theorists and Their Work,This text - essential to a course I am taking and to oe I am teaching was an OLDER edition than I needed which was not stated...I will think very carefully before ordering again.
1,Leddy & Pepper's,"This is a book you will use infrequently. If you have to have this book for class, buy the used version and resell. It is not one you will be wanting to reference in the future. Lacks content and is poorly organized."
1,The first sentences of the very first chapter represent this book perfectly,"""The words 'nurse,' 'nourish,' and 'nurture' all come from the Latin root 'nutrire.' The word nurse may be used as either a noun or a verb (Agnes, 2005).""As you might have correctly extrapolated, the content is usually too theoretical to be useable, yet too rigid to inspire meaningful reflection. The tone is sometimes moralistic, and the writing always very bland. Many times I found myself thinking ""they must have a page quota to meet.""If you need this book for class, rent it."
2,By far the most boring book ever,"In my humble opinion one should only keep this book as long as the class and return it as soon as possible for credit. This book I found was drab, boring, and very one sided. I, as a ADN, felt belittled repeatedly as the verbage describes anyone less than a BSN weighed, measured, and found wanting in every aspect of nursing."
4,RN to BSN Program Text,"Leddy & Pepper's text Conceptual Bases of Professional Nursing, 7th edition is the book used for my course at University of Central Missouri. The text has fully met my expectations for addressing the high level concepts of nursing ethics, the role of the professional nurse, and conceptual theories of nursing practice. The text is current in its citations and references, with materials drawn from research and publications as recent at early 2009. (the text was published in 2010) I find the text a reasonably easy read with clearly drawn out key points. I would recommend this text to any instructor or student, or as a refresher on professional nursing theory."
5,Must-read for anyone into music or pop culture studies.,"David Brackett's work is a major contribution to the field of popular music scholarship, as well as to the growing debates about the future of music studies. It's wonderfully readable, thoughtful and wide-ranging, and he challenges some sacred cows in both musicology and popular music studies.There's something for everyone here: chapter topics range from Hank Williams to James Brown to Elvis Costello. And Brackett smoothly uses a stunning array of approaches tailored to each of these widely varied musics. If you're interested in popular culture, popular music, or music studies, DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!--Anahid Kassabia"
5,"Top quality, expensive look, great light",This is a must according to code for a damp location like above a tub or shower or outdoors. What's really neat about it is that it projects below the ceiling so it radiates light better than a flush glass lens. I thought it would look strange with the other baffled ceiling lights in the bathroom but it looks just fine. I've got a 60 watt equivalent spiral flourescent in the fixture (Sylvania seems to have the best color) and the light output is more than ample. It's a pricey little devil but worth every penny.
3,OK.......,"i dont know if this is just an 8 inch mid range or what. i have it all hooked up right and still it plays lows, highs, and voice. it does play a little bass too, but not a lot. i would not reccomend this"
2,Defense has little to do with this book,"Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the title of this book and the introduction are completely misleading. The main sections are Lasker and Petrosian as ""Defender"" and yet most of the Lasker games are him attacking and Crouch talks about the opponent under pressure!! Another case of ridiculous writing. Don't be fooled by the word heavy annotations either, it's mostly bs about what other people said and rarely relates to the theme of defense. I've read three books on defense, Andy Soltis ""The Art of Defense in Chess"" has been the best so far. I also read the one by POlugayevsky with the same title, not as good. This is the worst so far because like I said, there's hardly any talk about defensive themes and the featured defenders are rarely the ones defending! Stupid marketing or stupid writing, I'm not sure which. I hope Mihail Marin and Jacob Aagaard's books aren't as disappointing, I'm moving on to them."
5,Now I am a Delbert fan,This was my first McClinton CD and now I am hooked! I have bought 2 more and they are all great.
3,"OKay, but not as good as Room to Move","This album is not a terrible album, but I feel it sounds a little flat compared to Delbert's past two albums as well as the live double that was put out recently. I've listened to it about five times now and don't feel I need to hear it again for a while. It's more the songs than the performance."
4,a unique and talented artist,I have been a fan of Delberts for years and he doesn't make a bad recording. I had the opportunity to see him with Marcia Ball this last saturday and he was fabulous. The new album is mostly upbeat with one or two songs of lost love on it. I really liked I had a real good time and One of the fortunate few. Two step two is a fun song. The entire cd is a pleasure of which to listen and appreciate Delberts' rough yet honeyed vocals. The amazing thing is he sounds every bit as good in person.
3,ok but disappointing,"As a Delbert McClinton fan, I expected more. The album is uneven as if some songs were added to fill it out. He has the voice and the delivery for country blues or honky tonk blues or whatever you want to call his music. He still has his chops, just needs to find better material. Tracks 2,4,9 and 11 stand out. This is one that probably would have been better to have a few less tracks"
3,Delbert has done it again,"As usual with Delbert, there are no fillers on this album. All are great songs, done up in the style that only Delbert can deliver."
1,What a shame...,"This cannot be the real Delbert McClinton, all throw-away songs save one. When Delbert leaves. . .Delbert's gone."
1,Not much honey flavor - smell and taste stale,"We love honey soy nuts and after reading about this company and reviews of their other products, we decided to try these. I wish we had bought a bag in the store first and not wasted money on a case. The honey flavor is almost non-existant and worst of all, they smell and taste stale. I won't buy a case of anything again without trying it first. I haven't figured out what to do with these, hate to just throw them out. I'm going to try baking them with some different seasonings to see if I can salvage them, but if not they may become squirrel food! I don't usually write negative reviews but I don't want anyone else to be disappointed with these nuts for their family the way that we were. Perhaps Melissa's will read this and figure out how to fix the problem!"
1,"No support, non returnable","Buyer beware! The ad for this back brace did not say that it is non returnable! I put it on for less than 5 minutes and it rode up by ribs. It does not support your back, nor does it improve your posture. I have a tall, thin frame, and it immediately pulled up around my ribs. They put a sticker on the box that says ""IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged, or credited."" This should have been mentioned in their ad, as I would not have purchased it, for that reason alone! I suggest trying this on in a store before investing in it. It's been donated to the local thrift store! A huge waste of money! I only gave it one star because it is required when you rate it, otherwise it gets no star!"
2,Bulky. Not to be worn under clothes,"Although this item helps somewhat, it is very bulky and cannot be worn under clothes discretely. It is a heavy, bulky vest, that may support you while doing chores and such."
