5,Bittersweet and bewitching tale of a heroic little girl.,"This true story of a little girl and the teacher who saves her is poignant. Written by a teacher who works with abused and mentally impaired children and told from her view point. Ms. Hayden is an outstanding writer and I have enjoyed many of her book, all of them true and touching stories. One Child, in particular, is amazing"
5,Wow is all I can say!,"It seemed to me in high school as though I was the only one who had such a great love of reading... so I spent all my free time in the libraby... which is where I found this book. I have been looking for it ever since, but had forgotten the name of the author. Now that I have found it, I won't let it go again. I truly beleive this book deserves a 10-star rating. You start reading this book, and I promise you will not be able to put it down. Looking forward to anything else Torey Hayden has ever written."
5,Astounding and timeless!,"I read this book when I was still living in an abusive house full of emotional turmoil 15 years ago...where being home meant anything but being safe. I vividly remember reading One Child wrapped in a blanket by the heater shivering till my teeth rattled. It took many years to realize that Tory's incredible story had not only touched my own inner pain, but given me hope that someone, somewhere would understand. There's no doubt in my mind that this book helped me reach out and get past all those secret hurts. It is an ongoing process, but having the love and understanding of someone like this incredible teacher really can give a child hope and courage to succeed. I think its time to re-read my love-worn copy upstairs. Owning Tiger's Child is next on my list!"
5,Great book,Good read if you work or want to work in the education field. It was a very touching story to experience
5,loved it.,"One of my favorite books of all time. If you've never read any of Torey Hayden's books, I'd recommend starting with either this one, or Ghost Girl. One Child really did impact my life; I will never forget it."
3,Enjoyable but much is doubtful,"I gave this story 3 stars because I found it enjoyable to read but much of the details are strange and doubtful. In the first place, A child as neglected and abused as this would have ended up in foster care especially after the incident with her uncle. The incident with the uncle certainly could have happened but she would have ended up in a facility or foster care. A school system would never have a child waiting 2 hours at school for the high school bus. High school kids get out much earlier than grade school kids so I don't know where that all came from. A school district could not have a teacher stay 2 hours with one student because of liability and the teacher contract. A pricipal would never tolerate the professional boundries Ms. Hayden crossed. This certainly may have been an intelligent child but an IQ of 182? Come on. I guess it sold the book."
5,A heartbreaking story with a sad but touching ending,I first read this book when I was 11 (I'm 22 now) and even then I wished I could have had a teacher like Ms. Hayden......She epitomizes the bond between a teacher and her students.
5,Great,"This book is great! If you enjoy reading, you will enjoy this book. The book is very easy to read. You can probably finish it in one day. Once I opened it, I couldn't put it down."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,I don't know what it was that brought me to this book and told me to read it but i thank whatever it was because this book moved me. What Hayden was able to do was create something so emotional so heart breaking yet hopeful that you almost wish it wasn't true. The events this book touches upon digs deep inside you and pulls out so much more than a peace of fiction ever could. I read this during the summer and I am so glad I did because I would have been able to just read a few chapters and go to bed i would have had to read and then miss classes from a lack of sleep
2,Not as witty or comical as you think,"Yes, you will be confused, unless of course you are older and British. Many of the activities and daily objects described in this book are from a bygone era or foreign (unless you are British!), making the humor in the book difficult to understand unless you are a historian. The language is not smooth, either, rather it is choppy and the content is jumbled."
1,Product never arrived,"Unfortunately I can't review the product itself because the package never arrived, but this product-line is excellent, I really recommend it and wish you do get it."
1,"High hopes, Low Mattress","We purchased the 10"" mattress and gave it a couple of days to fill out. At best, it expanded to 9.25"". Within 30 days, the nominal thickness is just a shade over 8"". The whole thing is ridiculous; there is a significant ridge in the center of the mattress between my sleeping position and my wife's. $600 worth of Chinese junk."
4,Just a tad bit daunting,"Somewheree between indie garage-rock and jazz lies The Up On In. At first listen, I wasn't too terribly impressed; by the time I had listened to it a secoind time, I was tappng my foot politely; by my third listen, I was eagerly grooving to the tracks. This group demands something from the modern listener that the modern listener all too often does not want to give: Patience and Attentiveness. You have to listen for the subtle thematic changes on this CD to truly apprecite it. These guys accomplish more with one take, three instruments and simple production techniques than most modern bands do with far more in all three areas."
4,Great!,"Full of catchy, concise, muscular instrumentals, ""Steps For the Light"" is sure to the sleeper fave of the indie scene this year. Zach Barocas' tight, precise drumwork provides the groundwork for the guitar and (electric and acoustic) bass to go nuts, but provides a tight enough leash to ensure that the songs don't slip into freeform improv festivals (actually, no song breaks 3:50). This is recommended if you like your instrumentals bite-sized, stripped-down, and soulfully precise."
5,Excellent!,"This book is excellent because it features ""Grand Galop Chromatique"", a piece virtually impossible to find anywhere else. The notes are reasonably good quality, and it contains other pieces less common such as Fantasia and Fugue on the Theme BACH or Gretchen. I recommend this book to all who are liszt fanatics, like me."
5,Great Pinking Shears!,"Very pleased with the quality and performance of these pinking shears. Plus, the price is quite reasonable compared with others I looked at in specialty stores."
2,Not of high quality,These scissors worked great for about one week (and I only sew as a hobby) and then they became very difficult to open fully. After reading other reviews I can see I am not the only person to have this issue. I recommend buying a different brand!!
2,The true story is better than her fiction!,"I'm very disappointed how much of the Bible Anita Diamant changed to make up a fictional story. She would have been much better off not using any of the Biblical names and claimed the whole story fictional.It would have been a much more interesting story had Anita told the story how Jacob worked 7 years, not months, for Rachael - his favorite wife (not Leah as Anita claims!!!). Those are the first of many, many distortions throughout the entire book.Several of the critics noted on the cover stated that she did such an outstanding job writing about women that had very few words written about them. That's very true. It's just very sad that Anita didn't bother to use those few words to tell the real story. I've never seen such a secular version of Biblical truth.God warns His followers they are not to change one word of His bible. Evidently Anita must have missed those verses, too!"
1,Not What I Expected.,"In a sense, a biblical novel is a historical novel. The writer must not inject her own theories that run perpendicular to the grain of history or to the Scriptures. A writer of an American Civil War history, for instance, would be doing his readers and history itself a great injustice if he portrayed Abe Lincoln as a pacifist. The Red Tent does just this sort of thing. Joseph married and had two sons, both blessed by Jacob and both becoming patriarchs to a half-tribe of Israel. He was a heterosexual, but Ms. Diamant portrays Joseph as a homosexual. This is not only historically innacurate but offensive to Conservative Jews and to others who take the Torah seriously. Not only is the book not based on good history or the Scripture, it is not a very well written book-- quite boring in fact. I give it one star because the cover illustration is beautiful."
2,"Not ""Like New""","I paid $25+ for this item so the least they could have done was to take off the Goodwill price of $3.06 that was still on the torn, taped up box. Definitely was not ""like new"" as it was advertised."
1,The Red Tent,Ordered July 2nd - cancelled order 7/14. Took too long to deliver. They did however refund my money.
3,Great voice but not biblical,"Diamant is a great writer. The main character's voice is unforgettable and truly entertaining. The fictional account of this character is full of imagination and very well could have happened. But, as to the religious practices, don't seek to find anything Biblical or Jewish about what happens in the red tent. I think the story could have been just as good (and maybe better) if Diamant had stayed true to the Jewish religion. I didn't like how she portrayed Rebecca -- very negative and not fair at all. Again, this was a good story and she is a great writer, but I wouldn't recommend it to my Christian friends."
1,Not Worth the Paper it is Printed On,"I was sadly disappointed with this book. It is FAR from historically accurate, and the author seems to be rather fixated on sex and variations of sex. I was really excited to read a book from Dinah's viewpoint, I thought that was a very original take, and I really enjoyed the prologue. After the prologue, the novel's redeeming value ended. I was hoping for something even remotely edifying, but ended up feeling a bit sick. Hopefully someone else will read this review and not bother reading this book."
2,Interesting at first but.......,"Since I love the stories about the patriarchs in the Old Testament, I enjoyed the first part of this book. Reading about how the women lived, trying to visualize them as real people, was fascinating. However, as the book moved on, I was disappointed. The main character Dinah is a victum who needs to be constantly rescued. She never stands on her own two feet. Her life is sad until the end when she is again rescued by a man. She never makes an effort to have her own life until a man saves her. I also found the description of Joseph as a weak egotist who needed her to go with him to visit his father Jacob, hard to believe. Also, Jacob was described as illiterate. That may or may not have been true, but was she any better?"
1,Biblical Disappointment,"The Red Tent appears tells an interesting story about a family that could have lived in hte times of Jacob and Joseph. Unfortunately, there are discrepancies between the portrayal of this family and values that would be consistant with prophets of God. Instead of being uplifting and inspiring it was at times dark and discouraging. I would not recommend this read to others."
1,Boring and Bland,"The Red Tent lacks many things that would make it a good book. One of the most important is some sense of purpose. The story is long and, apart from a few incidents, incredibly boring. There are only so many ways any writer can describe labour and childbirth. The main character is colourless and bland. She has momentary flashes of personality but in general I did not care what happened to her. Her aunts are far better developed and although interest in them ends abruptly they hold the first half of the book together. The second half of the book is a convoluted plot to get Dinah to the right place and time to reunit with her once beloved Joseph. By the end of the book I had no interest in any of the characters and was annoyed with the insipidness of the book.As an attempt to flesh out the role of women in the Old Testament the book is a partial success. As a work of literature it falls far short of being a well written and a work of merit."
1,A Most Overrated Book that took Ridiculuous Liberties,The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit this so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.It is also a stereotype to say that only a fundamentalist would object to this book.That is pure ignorance just as the author displayed when writing a very mediocre story. Of what revelance is it if someone sends money in to Pat Robinson when the book is the subject of opinion here?
1,First re-writing history - now the Bible!,"I got one-third through the book before I quit reading it. It was not because of the development and furtherance of the Bible story, but I got tired of reading about a woman's time of the month, birthing, adventures with sheep, and jerky men. If the author had taken the story and made it into an allegory or a separate story, but her re-writing of Bible bothered, plus the fact that she made so feminist. Nothing against feminism, but one must take into context the time when this story happened and not compare it to today's standards. There were bad times back then, but there were good times also. Basically, though, I just lost interest in this book."
1,historical???,"I loved the idea of the red tent when I first heard about it because it was a measure taken to protect the fellowship between women as well as give them a place to recover from childbirth and to rest during menstrual cycles.But what I found in this book was far from refreshing - in fact it pained me to read such a negative account of the events of the Tenakh. Though it is obvious that the voice of women is not often heard throughout the Tenakh, this book went overboard in terms of creating feminist, pagan, backbiting, spiteful characters who don't relate well at all with the men in their lives, nor with the G-d they are in submission to.It was a lewd and thoroughly disappointing read. Not biblical at all, this book should not even be considered close to any kind of a historical account - metaphorical or otherwise."
4,A New unndersatnding,"I read this book and thought it was really good becasue it showed you what it was like a long time ago and how hard it was for women, to have to live. If you think you have a hard time with child birth and that little thing you get every mounth read this book and you might just change your mind. The women have to go thought so much hardsiph and do things to please the men you will be glad you live to day. I would recamend this book to any women or man who wants a new way to think about things. I hope this helps you decied to enjot this book."
2,"Anti-feminist, anti-woman, violent, desolate","I gave up on The Red Tent, although I was supposed to read it for a book club meeting. Despite the beautiful style, I found it desolate. The womens' plight always seemed so hopeless. I tried, but could not find anything to appreciate about women depicted as property and second-class citizens, lying on soiled straw during one's period, taking a girl's viginity with a piece of wood or vague descriptions of ""pleasuring"" ""animal noises"" describing sex, and ""his sex"" and ""her sex."" Worst of all, after we suffer through two-thirds of the book with Dinah, her mate is slaughtered in the most horrible way. This book has a problem--it's trying to be an imaginative account of the Bible, and that may be a contradiction in terms. The author's style and imagination just don't cut it here."
1,Ex-Witch Recognizes Pagan Lit,"I was involved in Wicca for over 20 years, read Mists of Avalon and many other similar literary works with pagan agendas during that time, and got the same distinctive (and unpalatable to me now) flavor when I read this novel. The goddesses are named repeatedly and fondly, so I feel certain many of the other one star reviewers instincts about this being a pagan piece are spot on.MUCH better stories about women would be the excellent works of Francine Rivers that flesh out Scripture with a satisfying and godly ring of truth:A Lineage of Grace: Five Stories of Unlikely Women Who Changed EternityandRedeeming LoveBlessings with love,Shalom ShickSavedXWitch*com"
2,What is historical fiction,"I think historical fiction is taking an actual event,time, etc. in history and making up a person, people, etc. who may actually have lived in those times. The fashion now is to take history and make up your own facts and people. The problem is that there are lots of people out there who take these historical novels as the truth. But the Bible actually was written about people who actually existed and tells their stories and about the Chosen People, God, etc. I actually have a problem with making up people who didn't exist or have biblical figures do things that aren't in the Bible. You know, it isn't called the Holy Bible, the Gospel, the Truth, etc. for nothing."
2,Bored in Bethesda,What a tiresome read! Endless and boring. I don't know what all the hoopla is about.
2,If only it was totally fiction,"This was a good story, even with the too strong anti-male tone. Even that wouldn't have been so bad, had the author not chosen to base this story on real people. I would've rather her have completely made up the story, including the characters, rather than trying to tie it in to anything that actually happened or anyone who actually lived."
1,A Well written fiction that completely breaks from the Bible,"One cannot deny that Diamant is a gifted writer. I agree with another reviewer who compared this book with Zimmer Bradly's The Mists of Avalon (complete with the goddess worship, and revisioning of traditionally viewed ""bad"" characters). It may have been Diamant's intention to subvert the Biblical text. She succeeds in doing this. The foremothers are goddess and idol worshippers; the forefathers'connection with God seems to pale in comparison. The only men presented in a positive light are ones who the bible clearly sees as negative. Dinah only finds happiness when she leaves the monotheism of her family for the pagan worship of the Egyptians. While other reviewers are anxious to share this with their daughters, I am not anxious to tell my daughter that the foremothers merely put up with the monotheism of their husband but remained worshippers of idols."
1,Disappointing Distortion,"This book was a disappointing distortion of the biblical facts of Jacob and his family. If you are Jewish or Christian this book can easily offend you. The idea of an historical fiction is meant to take the historical facts about a person and then embellish the details about their true historical story without changing the spirit of what we already know. This book did NOT do that. It took the biblical facts about Jacob and his family and changed them from a family who worshiped the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham in to a pagan family. The information about the customs and communities of Jewish women of that time period could have been very interesting if the facts of this story had not been butchered."
4,Unique,"Well, it's often hard to find a unique book...this one fits the description though!I admit i thought it would be boring- but it's not. The tempo of the book is pretty fast and you don't get a chance to get bored.Some of the stories are very interesting & it's fun to picture what it would be like to be there."
4,A book for women and well worth it,"At the risk of sounding sexist, I think this is a fine novel which will appeal to women of all ages. It is finely written, and thought provoking, and has all the real flavour of biblical times and places. But it is a novel of women, written by a woman, and in my opinion with the intention to be appealing to women.I sought out the relevant passages in my Bible, and there they were, just the bare bones of the story as Dinah suggests at the beginning of her narrative. But let me stress, this is the author's FICTIONAL fleshing out of that tale, and to all of those who may be looking for more, you will not find it.What you will find is a riveting tale of women living and loving in difficult times, but coping with humour and wit and grace. It is a very entertaining novel, and I recommend it."
2,I guess I just don't get it.,"After reading the 5 star reviews on the web, I purchased the Red Tent. Being a lover of historical fiction, I thought I was in for a real treat. I guess I just don't get it because I had to force myself to finish this book. I got into the characters alright but halfway through the book they were gone. The part that had the most profound affect on me was when Dinah had to accept the fact that she would always be distant from her son. I think it is since their life and customs are so unfamiliar to me that I found it hard to follow. I'm not familiar with a lot of Bible stories."
2,Out of step,"Boy, am I in a tiny minority of the customer reviewers who gave this book a low rating. To me, Daiman's tale is nothing more than wordy hokum. I struggled through about a fourth of the story, and was so distracted by the stilted writing and the simplistic characters, I just gave up. Maybe it's something at this stage in my life that throws me into the negative camp. Could it be I'm getting old and cranky?(...)"
2,Women of Bible Times.,"The portrayal of the women from this time period was insightful and seemed accurate, but the Biblically based story didn't follow Biblical facts too closely."
5,A Must Read,Anita Diamant immerses her readers in the world on pre-Christian civilization. This book is a must read for women of all ages.
5,"A little hard to follow, but worth sticking with.","When reading this book, it helps to have a little religious background or interest. This is a risky topic, and I commend Diamant for tackling it.Over all, this book is captivating."
3,For the non historian,"Too much like a novel, without historical facts to back it up. It reads like a novel and not my style."
4,Good read,"An enjoyable and good read. The author writes of a character from the Bible ""Dinah' who is only mentioned once in the Bible. The book is not religious but very interesting in that the author uses this historical perspective to create the story. i very much enjoyed this mingling of history, biblical characters and fiction. My daughter and i, however, both found the ending a little startling and odd. It sort of came out of left field."
5,Great Book,"Very well written and intresting. I was inspired to reread Genesis after finshing this book. Very believable, I recommend"
5,"Written beautifully, very moving","Let me begin with the fact that some people may not enjoy this book for the stark details about the female experience. If you can get past that, this is a wonderful book.I loved the stories interwoven in The Red Tent, especially in the first two parts. The last part is does drag a little, but it is still interesting.The reason I gave this 5 stars is because I truly enjoyed reading a book that took me back to the time when life was really like this. While I am sure their lives were much more difficult without the technology we have today, I found myself yearning for the simplicity of baking, sewing, medicine, and sense of community that was so well-described in Ms. Diamant's book. I recommend it for any woman of any age who wants to dive into a fantastic biblically-based novel."
5,A book about women,"This is a book about the relationship among women. It begins with the relationship between four sisters and the connections between them. Throughout this book you will see relationships between a mother and a daughter, a daughter and a mother-in-law, and a daughter and a grandmother, you will even see the bonds between a women and her true friends. This book was so wonderful up until the very end. I gave it to my Mother and to my sisters who also could not put it down. This book will cause you to reflect on your relationships with the women in your life, from past to present. An EXELLENT READ"
5,The Reality of Women in the Old Testament,"This book breaks through the male dominated, written, and preached Old Testament and takes me back to the Red Tent. I would love to speak with Anita and ask here how she developed her characters, ones that were based on one or two line mentions in the Book of Genesis. This book is a celebration of women and womanhood."
4,A Woman's Voice,"I love Diamants style. She not only gave each woman in The Red Tent character but a voice. I was hooked after reading the first page. However, I must say I became gravely disappointed with the turn of pages post Dinah's retreat to Egypt. Did the two countries so closely together live so opposite in behaviors. Dianah, became shallow. Why didn't we hear about how she coped with the changing world she lived in. What kind of foods did she eat. Why didn't she speak to her Father at the end? Hmmm.Although, I do not believe this is how Jacob and family lived. I enjoyed this piece of fiction very much. It stayed with me for weeks and weeks after reading it."
1,The Red Tent...I guess it's all in your viewpoint,"I was so excited to read this book, as I'd heard it was ""really good."" I'm afraid I didn't get very far and I ended up dumping the book in the garbage. There are a lot of strange things going on in the Old Testament, I agree, but I thought the beginning of this novel was very crude. Laban's pictured as a sex-crazed fellow who is lusts after and chases the female goats, or whatever they had. Jacob is seen gratifying himself out in the open.I think Anita D. has really done her research. I would have loved to enjoy the book and the results of her hard work, but couldn't get past the portrayal of men and women ""of the covenant"" living such selfish, coarse lives. I'm sure I'll hear from everyone about what a prude I am, but reviews are based on personal reactions to literature, so I think I'm entitled to my opinion. Not everyone likes that kind of garbage. She dedicated this book to her daughter, and I wouldn't have MY daughter read it."
3,A little bit shocking...,"We read the red tent for a book club in our Church. I loved the concept of womanhood and sisterhood. It was a little shocking how she portrayed some of the Characters from the Bible. I was especially disappointed with how she portrayed Rebecca. (She turned her into a type of Lady Catherine Deburg - from ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Rebecca was cold hearted and portrayed more as a goddess worshipper always sitting on her throne and Isaac was some feeble man in love with some caretaker). I was also shocked by some of the ritual scenes the women carried out on eachother. Mainly, if you think of it as pure fiction, you may be alright.. but if you know much about the characters from the Bible, you may have some issues with it. It was an interesting read, but definitely not one I loved."
5,amazing story for those who understand,"This is a compelling story through which, as a young (and green) adult male, I have grown a little wiser. I have grown to understand women and their perspective a bit better. The story has quite a few amazing twists that leave you shaken for hours.The novel is definitely the best book I've read in years - simply couldn't put it down."
3,You don't need to know stories in the bible to read it...,"I was a little hesitant to read it, simply because I kept hearing it was a ""woman's book"" surrounding ""menstruating in a tent"". The beginning was a little dull, but stick with it, once you get to know the women, you will live with them throughout this religious era and come to get a perspective of what it would have been like to live in those times. I didn't have any biblical background and was able to follow the story. It is not a ""light"" read though, if you are a Bridgette Jones/Love story reader, this is not for you."
1,DO NOT READ,"I completely agree with Beutler on this book. I was very interested and excited to read this book and when I got into it, it just made me sick. I questioned if I should continue reading it to ""give it a chance"" but I find myself struggling. The story is not based on facts and she is fully aware of it. She feels that she has the liberty to change the facts and then tries to justify it. Something so clear in the bible of Jacob working 7 years for Rachel- she states they negotiated to 7 months then adds in the end of the book that time is irrelevant as they did not have a calendar back then...If the bible says 7 yeas, why change the facts? After this point I continued to find false statements about Rachel and her sister.It is a good read if you are not aware and have knowledge of the biblical text. But it is not even close to what the bible represents. DO NOT READ! She claims it is biblical when it is clearly not."
5,One of the best reads ever!,"This book is so compelling,it grabs you from page one and dares you to put it down! Definately a 'woman's book'. If you are a mother, you will have a new appreciation for your life after reading this book. I recommend it to all women, but to mothers especially."
4,beautiful story,"I try to guard my 5 star ratings, so this one isn't quite up to that, but it's really higher than a 4. It's a beautiful story that is also gorgeously written, and I loved every page. It's also a neat perspective on several biblical characters whom the Bible merely mentions and then brushes past and forgets. As a child, I always wanted to know more about these women. Anita Diamant answered that prayer. There is very little truly historical information on the women themselves, but their times have been studied extensively, and Diamant has done her research well to present a novel that practically breathes on its own."
4,Worth the Wait,This book was a struggle until I reached thesecond part of the story. Ms Diamant shinesfrom this point on. I have recommended it to severalfriends despite the slow start.
4,Don't let the first half turn you away from this book,"For the first half of this book, I had a very difficult time keeping all the characters straight. The book moved slowly, I didn't understand who was narrating at first, and I was frequently turning back to refer to the family tree printed in the beginning. Fortunately, I continued reading. Once I got to about page 200, I could not put the book down. I would read other fiction by this author."
5,Great Read,I really loved this book. It was very wel written. I enjoyed the complexities of each of the characters and how each of them helped to build Dinah's story and life.
5,Family Read,"My grandmother, my mother, and I all read this book. As a non-practicing Jewish family, we all felt this book touch our roots in some way. I had an indescribable feeling inside when reading this book. It was as if I had somehow been there long ago. I loved Diamant's Old Testament based work intensely. It is a very historical, drawn out, detailed novel so be aware of this before you delve into it. It is still, however, fascinating and a beautiful account of the tragic and amazing life of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. I couldnt get through Diamant's fictional work but this one is definitely recommended if you are at all interested in feminine historical fiction."
5,A Beautiful Story,"I must have cried a hundred times while reading this book. I loved it! I really enjoyed Dinah speaking directly to the audience; I think that device underscored the assumption that this is a story for all women. The message that I got from the book was that we are all sisters, with the same hurts and joys, bound together by the things that make us women--childbirth, menses, love. Anita Diamant did not write this book, Dinah spoke through her."
2,"CAN THIS BE HIGHER RANKED THAN ""THE ENGLISH PATIENT""?","It's enjoyable, and somewhat creative. But should Anita Diamont's book get more stars than Ondaatje's English Patient. One's a good read, the other should NOT BE MISSED."
1,Another anti-Christian stealth book,"This book tries to pass itself off as biblical in nature while it is pure fiction. The author clearly blames God for not providing women with enough leading roles in Genisis and attempts to remake the bible in her own feminist image.There are a number of similar anti-Christian books on the market that employ the same strategy (The Davinci Code is a good example). The author cannot denounce the Christian reglion outright, so fabricating a blasphemous storyline to replace the original is the alternative goal.Anita Diamant is Jewish and not Christian. She has written books outlining how to reject the Christian religion and convert to Judaism. I would suggest ""The Red Tent"" only as a companion guide to someone who has such a goal. It is not a book written to help a Christian woman deepen her understanding of the role of women in the Old Testament."
1,Don't be fooled into thinking it's a Christian book...,"I really regret reading this. Why on earth was it in the religion section of the bookstore? It should have been shelved with the occult books. It reads like it was written by an atheist, or maybe a pagan feminist. I destroyed it because I didn't want some other unsuspecting victim to be fooled into reading it, thinking because it's in the Christian section, that it's a Christian book. According to ""The Red Tent,"" men are pigs, the Bible is wrong, God is cruel, Joseph loved boys, and so on. It went on and on and ON! The overly long, lovingly detailed descriptions of the joys of paganism and idol worship were stomach turning. Don't pollute your mind or heart with this trash!"
4,Anyway expecting Biblical accuracy will be disappointed.,"The Red Tent is not a book for those reader looking for fictional novels of biblical stories. Although the novel is the story of Dinah, the conflict between female-based religions and Judeo-Christianity is at the heart of the novel.Another reviewer referred to The Red Tent as a ""chick"" book and I would definitely agree. I think the novel does appeal more to female readers than male reader simply because a large portion of the story is about the community of women.Diamant tells an interesting and engaing story. This is a worthwhile read."
2,What a disappointment!,"This book was terrible! I really thought it would be a good Bible story but incredibly, it was a very poor one. It was good to learn that Jacob was a tender lover but a ""sorry"" father and leader. Oh, and Joseph had sex with men and was hated by all who worked with him. This was a book of fiction! There was no character development so when people died, I wasn't even sad. Remember, don't read this book if you want to read about God's chosen people; you'll end up wondering why they were chosen!"
1,Simply Awful,"The author clearly betrays her lack of familiarity with the times and customs of places she describes. The characters are caricatures of the persons from the Bible. The prose is also awkward. The fact that some of the plot contradicts the biblical text is,I suppose, poetic license. Too bad Diamant is no poet. How can anybody like this book?If you want good and well written novels on biblical themes, try Paulo Cuelho's ""Fifth Mountain"" or Lion Feuchtwanger's ""Jafteh and his daughter"".Mann's ""Joseph and his brothers"" is a much better treatment of the Jacob's family saga than ""the red tent"""
1,Not appropriate Christian reading,"I heard so many good reviews from my friends that I had to give this book a try. I was VERY disappointed and saddened by the sexual explicitness of the author. To be frank, she makes Labon a pervert, Jacob a masturbater, and Joseph a bisexual. Christians do not need to be reading this. Remember: Garbage in - garbage out! I am most saddened by the many readers who eat this stuff up, as if sexual sins a normal part of life. They are not supposed to be a normal part of life. And, yes, even the bible acknowleges that Dinah was raped, but the bible does not go into the details in order to teach us lessons. We do NOT need to read this kind of garbage as our entertainment."
3,Feminist Revisionism,"I love historical fiction, but I prefer that any modern anachronistic sensibilities stay out of the story. While I expected a biblical story told from the female point of view, I was not prepared for a feminist agenda. I also expected some expansion and revision of the bare facts of the original story (which is, after all, the task of the historical novelist), but I found Diamant's efforts to be perverse and lacking in imagination. I give the book three stars, as I do believe it does a decent job of depicting some aspects of the daily life of women in those times."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"This book is shallow, glib, pandering, and, from what I have been able to find out, not historically accurate. Not interesting. Not well-written. If you are interested in re-tellings of Bible stories, check out Jim Crace's Quarantine. It's literate, intelligent, and a creative piece of fiction."
2,How The Red Tent affected me...,This book is an interesting read but is definetly a work of fiction. It adds much to the lives of these historical figures which is not based on biblical scriptures. If you know the Bible you may become offended about midpoint by the direction the author takes these historical characters. This book left me with a sense of sadness for all the people who read it and will believe it as truth.
2,Don't read The Red Tent until you read this,"I enjoyed the time period in which this novel was set. However, I would have preferred it to be completely fictional and not based upon real people. Why? For the simple reason that there are several obvious contradictions to the biblical account of Dinah and her family. I would encourage any who wish to read this book to first read the following passages from the bible: Genesis 25:19-34, 27:1-28:9, 29:1-35:26, 37:1-36, 39:1-50:26. Not all of these are directly tied to the novel, but they give background and family history. Pay close attention to 29:22-30, 31:34&35, and 39:10&12. Even if you know the stories of Jacob and Joseph, it won't hurt to refresh your memory."
4,Is it real?,"""The Red Tent"" presented a world that is not described in the Bible. A real one just the same. Even though the story would be hard to prove against the facts of the Bible, it gave the reader a chance to see how the family unit was handled and cared for in that time and place. As a women I found the story very nurturing. It is amazing how women have cared for other women through the centuries."
4,The Red Tent,"I picked this book up at the store not knowing what it was about but I liked the title. During the reading, I was compeled to search Biblical references regarding the characters. It felt like more than a novel. To understand the nature of women's desire to be with each other and also their desire to cling to their men became the theme of the book for me. I could identify with many of the situations and the desires. I liked it. I am presently reading Good Harbor and I like it too."
1,WRONG WRONG WRONG,"I couldn't even finish this novel because of the incredible inaccuracies to the true Biblical account. I enjoy novels which use actual biblical stories as a backdrop and expand on actual accounts and characters, suggesting what ""could have happened,"" as long as they keep the facts straight, but the author of this novel changed so many of the facts that I could not enjoy the novel and finally got rid of it. The Biblical truth is so much more interesting that what she came up with anyway. I read the book because a friend of mine who does not know the Bible asked me to read it and tell her if it was true, because she assumed the author wouldn't have changed the actual story thus she believed everything the author wrote. After reading as much as I could endure, I told my friend the true story and pointed her to the actual account in the Bible, but I'm afraid she will always get the story wrong now that she has The Red Tent stuck in her head. The author had a chance, but she blew it!"
2,hmmmm,"I'm interested in Judaism and historical fiction, but I found The Red Tent rather dull and a bit too much of a bodice-ripper for my tastes. Gave up after a chapter or so."
1,Trivializing,"This book was highly recommended to me by friends I respect and given to me as a holiday gift by a priest. I was very disappointed. I think it is a cheapening of the human experience by focusing on the physical and reducing women to primarily ""cow-like"" experiences and men to ""ram-like"" behavior. In other words, I prefer my historical novels with more dimensions than bodily functions. I read it all with near-disgust at the lack of spirituality in a historically spiritual era and because of the reduction of women to a merely animal level. I found it a disappointing, one-dimensional book."
3,Good and Bad,"This story was not bad, in fact it was quite interesting, if you don't mind the descriptions of crude reality. I admired the storytelling and gossiping of the women in the red tent, and I enjoyed the scandals of death, love, hate, and suspicion; but most of all I beamed at the women's prospect of those days, and the difference between men and women.This book has suspicion, surprise, romance, it is the ultimate women's story. But what i was not expecting were the crude tellings of mens lust for animals, and girls secrets of love. So this book is not truly meant for children."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"For anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, this is a book for you. I have never read anything which so vividly portrays the Biblical time and place which we've seen displayed over and over (think Ten Commandments) on TV and in books. If you're put off by the idea that this is a ""Christian"" book -- don't be! The author portrays the women as pragmatic, going about their business and participating in their traditional culture -- including worshiping their old gods. The men -- well, they're involved in some crazy business about ""the one true God"" but it leads to nothing but trouble. My only complaint about this book was that the author spent so much time and detail fleshing out the first 2/3 of the protagonist's life and then sort of rushed through her later years. I would have gladly kept reading for a few hundred more pages in order to get the full level of detail all the way through. Well worth reading!"
5,Simply Wonderful,"My mother sent this as a Christmas gift for my sisters and I. This is my favorite gift this year. I can't wait to share it with everyone I know. The care Anita Diamant takes in telling this story in unparallel. I have never been so moved. Although completely fiction, the way that she describes the characters relationships is true even today. It will make you look at your relationships and the legacies that you are leaving behind. Simply amazing, I feel blessed having had the experience of reading this novel."
2,Just couldn't quite connect with the characters or the story.,"After so many glowing reviews of this book I found myself dissapointed at the end. I just never really cared about the story or the characters enough throughout the entire book. Granted, the second half is more interesting than then the first, but just barely enough to keep me reading through to the end.I was really hoping for some heartwarming story to connect me to my fellow women but that never happened. I don't think it was necessary for the author to deviate so much from the Biblical story, or at least the part that was described in the Bible. I also found the way she painted most of the men as despicable was distracting and unnecessary for portraying the hardships that women in those days no doubt suffered. If I had to describe this book in one word, the word that keeps coming to mind is disappointment."
5,"Wonderful, entertaining, heartbreaking!",I recommend this book to ALL women! Wish some of the customs in this book were still around today!
2,"Good writer, but took too many liberties....","First off, this writer is very good. Her descriptions of the characters and of what is happening is beautiful. It was an easy book to read although it is for more mature audiences.However, overall I was not pleased by the book. I didn't like how graphic the novel was. I just felt that some things could have been left out of the book. I also felt that the author took too many liberties while creating personalities for the people of the Bible. She tarnishes the names of people by making them into sexually perverted people and the Bible gives no indication that they were.Although the book is well written, I would have rather had the author stay more parallel to what the Bible says about the characters mentioned."
4,Emotionally Evocative,"From all the male-centric biblical literature we get our first glimpse of the women behind the men. We are allowed into the red tent and share their hopes, fears, loves and ultimately the female experience we can all identify with. It's a shame that the religious tradition this follows does not take the time to honor their heroines but with this book at least some have a voice. To every woman in the world, read this and feel the connection that surpasses religion and culture, the connection we all have as women."
4,A New take on an old story,"Don't read this book if you are looking for bible study. But if you want to read FICTION, then it's a good read. It uses the bible as a launching point, not as a resource that must be closely followed. It is an imaginative, colorful exploration, not intended to have any claim of accuracy. As such, it succeeds. If you like this book, you should also read The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis."
4,Interesting take on an old story.....,"This is a fascinating tale that takes the story of the bible and expounds upon the family and time that was originally represented. I am not a strong religious person, so don't let the subject matter turn you off from this terrifc book. I found the liberties Diamant took added so much to this book. I enjoyed the way she wove the stories together and gave voice to Dinah, who was just a few short lines of verse in the bible. This book is a beautiful representation of the complex relationships between sisters, mothers and daughters. This story is often touching, full of sorrow, but also relays the joys of womanhood. Excellent read!"
5,A bond with the women of our past,"I think every reader would find a connection to Dinah. To me, it was a beautiful story of a woman's life.. of her aging into an adult, her closeness with the women around her, her relationships with men- romantically and otherwise, childbirth, death and the trials and errors of being a woman. Above all though, I think it paints a strong picture of what life was like for women during Biblical times. I especially enjoyed the subject of midwifery... the herbs used and the bonds and spirituality that is tied to it. I definately would argue that this is one of the most interesting and influential books I've read. I've already mailed out a copies to my mom and my sisters!"
5,A wonderfully written novel..,"The Red Tent is a beautifully written book. A tale of an ancient world that leaves the reader moved. I was hooked after reading the first few pages of this story. Anita Diamant has a true gift as a writer. I found myself transported to ancient biblical times and found myself being able to connect with the women in this finely crafted novel. The Red Tent is a book that modern women can connect with. A story of love, pain, celebration, and honor.I found it to be captivating, and thought provoking. A wonderful read."
4,"Good, but not what I expected.","The story was well written and pulled me into the pages quickly. I was expecting something completely different. While I was aware that the author was not a Christian, I was expecting a little more Old Testament history. The women of the story all worship many different gods and goddesses. I was expecting more. I was not disappointed with the entertainment of the story, but other than most of the characters names come from the Old Testament, and certain stories coming into play, there is very little to this story that could be classified as Biblical fiction. I love Egyptian history and fiction, and I think this would fall more into that category."
1,An entertaining blasphemy,"With all of the fundamentalist hand wringing surrounding Harry Potter(undeserved), I can't believe that this book isn't being condemened from every pulpit. This book is a pagan catechism. From the perspective of the narrator of this story The Goddess is good and the God of Abaraham is only one in the long list of petty gods and goddesses that must be appeased. It is entirely possible that the real Dinah may have believed this,but this book should have clearly warned the reader that this is a strongly anti-Jewish/Christian book."
1,A literary milestone: more boring and sanctimonious than the Old Testament!,"The Red Tent is to be avoided at all costs and though I haven't read any, I would urge the entire world not to buy Anita Diamant's other books. Please prove to her that women aren't stupid enough to be duped into buying a book by doing your market research, spending a few weeks in the Library of COngress and pressing all the right feminist, biblical and new-age buttons. Worthy, patronising totally lacking in historical credibility and just plain boring. This book just proves that taking an old, politically incorrect story and correcting it is far from a foolproof recipe for great literature."
2,The Red Tent....ahhh...the smell of it...phew!,"I'm not familiar with the Old Testament, nor am I a mother. I have less than zero interest in the female bodily functions of others. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies and I don't want to. That said, I found this book a chore. It was, in fact, an assignment for my book club. Had it not been, I would have steered clear of it. However, if these topics enthrall you, pick up the book and knock yourself out. None of the women portrayed were deeply drawn. Dinah (pronounced ""dee nah"") herself was not fully formed. The men were meer stick figures, less than two dimensional. It is, by far, the bloodiest book I've ever read. There is more blood and gore in this innocent novel than in any Steven King horror fest. At best, it's deeply superficial. And finally, I would not want to set foot in a red tent. Ohh...the smell of it. That's what I was left with."
1,Midwifery Miscarriage,"Sickeningly obcessed with one aspect which though important is not the be-all and end-all of womanhood. Its slant is so unifocal and simple/singlemided as to be truly an embarassment to women and demeaning to both sexes as portrayed. I read through this junk so I could criticize it having read through it entirely, although it was obvious to me after ten pages that the style and perspective were remarkably immature. The writing style is dumbed-down to a fourth grade level. If she could get off her gender obcession she might write nice books for young readers. God forbid a young female mind should read this!"
1,If you are a strong Christian this is not the book for you,"I picked up this book expecting to read something that would enhance my faith and understanding of the Bible; however, I was offended by it. This book celebrates paganism and portrays bestiality as ""normal"" behavior. I also find it implausible that all women in those days menstruated at exactly the same time and it only lasted for 3 days - a real stretch, don't you think? It was quite a disappointment."
3,Interesting but biblically inaccurate,"I was at first fascinated with the storytelling in this book. Riveted by the perspective of a woman in ancient biblical times I was eager to read more. However, having studied the lives of Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph quite a bit, I began noticing that Anita took a lot of liberties with the accounting of biblical history. In my opinion at book based on the Bible should at least remain true to the facts around which the story is centered. From the love professed between Leah and Jacob to the character of Joseph I found that she dramatically distorted the truth to serve the purposes of her story. I think the story is well written and in any other context (non-biblical) I would have thoroughly enjoyed the book as a great story and a great character. She needed to have found another setting for her character of Dinah to retain her credibility as an author. I don't think I will be reading any more of her bible character based stories."
2,Fiction,"This book is well written and definitely has a story to tell. However, it is a fiction and at time it becomes hard to remember that. Please, be advised it is inaccurate description of Biblical events."
1,Disgusting SMUT!!,"Although this book is interesting in a historical context, the sex and inappropriate portions far outweigh the good parts of the book. I felt like I needed to go wash my eyes out after reading part of this book. Filthy!"
3,Just okay for me,"I liked the idea of expanding on Dina's story. However, the content was sometimes a little to personal, at times gross, for me. I was also taken aback when I saw how much Diamante deviates from the actual text. This is not just an expansion of the story, but sometimes was outright false. A good story if not taken literally."
3,A Bible Bodice Ripper,"Well written, well researched, but what an absurd spin on the tale of Dinah in the Book of Genesis and the circumstances surrounding the defending of her honor by her despicable Father and Brothers in the face of her long suffering Mothers. Frankly in my estimation, this is just an example of blatant male bashing! I am a woman reader, and I might add very well liberated and in suport of female causes but lets give men some credit rather than always depicting them as heartless predators. In attempting to develop a strong female character in control of her life in a primitive period of history, Ms. Diamant, struggles eloquently to plead a plausible case but fails to do so with any reasonable semblance of acceptance. If the author persues the use of the Bible for her future works, she certainly has a lot of fertile ground to work with. I'd be very interested in her rendition of the Story of Eve. Sorry can't give the same praises to this one as your other reviewers."
1,Not Biblically accurate,"This book portrays the women of the Bible as worshiping many other gods but not Abraham's God. I found this very disturbing as I have read other great books by Orson Scott Card (Sarah) (Rebekah) (Rachel) in the ""Women of Genesis"" series that are so inspiring and are faithful to the Bible account. I know this book has received good reviews but I believe it is because the readers have not read better, more accurate accounts. Another recommended writer is Lynn N. Austin's series called 'Chronicles of the King.' The first book in this series is ""The Lord is my Strength."" There are 5 books in this series and you will feel yourself being pulled closer to God and prayer. All of Lynn Austin's books are wonderful and so good you will not want to put them down."
1,Overwrought sentimentality,"While it was a great idea to write about a Biblical event from women's point of view, Diamant is obsessed with California-mystical sexuality. How many descriptions of oiled hair and bloody childbirth can you read?"
1,Seeking Biblical Based Fiction,"....then this is not the book for you. While the story was entertaining, I found that many of the events written about by the author were in direct contradiction to the Bible. For fictional books based on Biblical facts, read Francine Rivers' Lineage of Grace series."
1,lewd,this book talks a lot about things of a sexual nature. not a book for people who have respect for the men in the bible.
1,Did I miss something???,"I am amazed when searching through the recommended reads and find this book constantly on the lists. Our book club tried reading it and none of us could even get through it much less find anything worthwile to recommend it.Maybe because I didn't finish it there was something in the end that would have brought it all together for me???It just didn't hold my interest to get more than half way through and believe me, I tried.THUMBS DOWN to this one!!"
1,"Reading ""The Red Tent""","As an American who has lived abroad for the last 7 years, I relish the few days each year I spend with childhood friends at our beach place in Massachusetts. Through the long summer afternoons, we discuss all the books we have read since the last time we have been together. The Red Tent was strongly recommended to me this past July and now I worry about what my friends think I like to read. The author of the Red Tent has taken an excellent idea, and probably has done research of a decent quality, and managed to turn out a book of remarkable pap-like quality. This is a good story exceptionally badly told. Save your pennies."
1,Beautiful but far from true,"My name is Dina. I did not rise from the dead to protect my name and that of my family, though I feel tied to my namesake, centuries away. This book was so very nicely written that it made me very sad to see how FAR FROM THE BIBLE it is, making our Mothers mere idol worshipers. The beauty of our Mothers is that in a time when idol worshipping was commonplace, they broke the consensus- often paying a heavy price- in order to worship one G-d. Maybe the next book of this genre will be better...."
1,Periods during the Biblical Period,"If you love to read about the woman's cycle -- this book is for you! If you like to read a Biblical story twisted beyond recognition -- you'll also love this book.Although the author is a talented writer, I hated the subject... Other than the biblical names, almost nothing matches the Biblical stories. I was extremely upset on the author changing the Almighty God to a heathen God..."
4,Very Different,"As one other reviewer claims, it is extremely slow reading for the first 150 pages or so. I found myself having to look back to the beginning of the book several times to understand the family tree as the members were being introduced. Jacob had so many wives, that it was hard keeping track who was who and which wife had which children. The last half of the book picks up quickly and truly captured my interest. Give this book a chance and don't put it down because it is slow reading to begin with but it is important to get the family tree straight and learn of the mothers stories to understand the latter part of the book. The thing that I liked best about this book though, was the fact that it was so different. So many books are so similiar that after awhile they all seem alike. This book is unlike any other and for this reason I truly enjoyed it."
3,This one was a struggle to get through.,"Most people I encounter who have read this book absolutely loved it. But for some reason it was a struggle for me to get through. This is perhaps because the writing is inconsistent. At times there is great detail which seems to drag and I found I was anxious for the story line to move on. I believe the fascination with this book is the fact that we know almost nothing about the everyday lives of women in Biblical times. In that respect, the author shows great imagination and is to be commended. However, if you are a writer, or even a fan of great writers, this book will disappoint you."
2,Sexy Bible Story,"It is difficult to explain why I just did not like this book. Perhaps it is because as a reader of the Bible and a student of history, it just seemed off the mark....too much sex and unlikely events.I am not a fan of historical fiction and read this book only because a book group is going to discuss it at our next meeting."
2,Fiction added to a story of heritage,THE RED TENT gives some interesting insight to the lives of the women of Jacob's family. Unfortunately the fictional elements added to the true story of Jacob caused me distraction. The author's writing style is poetic and captivating but this book is not a good read for those who know and love the heritage and truth of the Bible.
1,Not what you might think!,"If you are looking for authentic and biblically based christian fiction, this book IS NOT it. I began to read it with high hopes but could not even finish it. I was very disappointed that the author was not accurate in the portrayal of the Biblical characters."
1,A Total Distortion of Biblical Fact,"The author certainly is at liberty to write almost anything about Dinah since the Bible says so little about her. It offends me, however, that she would take such liberties with Biblical characters such as Joseph. The Bible gives us a great deal of information on Joseph. For the author to trivialize Joseph in such a way is appalling and as I see it, a cheap way to sell books. The author wrote, for example, that Joseph had sex with not only Potiphar's wife (not Biblical) but with Potiphar as well. It's one thing to fictionalize characters we know little about, but to distort Joseph was completely unnecessary."
2,Too Bizarre,"With each chapter I debated whether to continue. Although it is mildly entertaining at moments, I am somewhat offended by the author's need to alter events from that which is recorded in the Bible. I am mystified as to the motivation behind such alterations. In some cases the truth is more dramatic than this retelling. Furthermore, I am at a loss to understand the author's need to portray her religious forefathers (and mothers) in such a poor light.The author's frequent use of misplaced modifiers kept me guessing - - disappointing from a journalist.Someone else's review said, ""Don't believe the hype."" I say Amen!"
1,Not telling the truth,"I read The Red Tent at the recommendation of friends. I will not recommend it to anyone else. Although the beginning started out well, I had to struggle to make myself finish it. The story has been familiar to me since I first read the Bible for myself, but Ms. Diamant's style of writing could not hold my interest. And since what little we know of Dinah is found in the (historically accurate) book of Genesis, I found it difficult to understand why a Jewish woman would want to write about Jewish men in such a down-grading way, or about Jewish women in such a pagan way - and about both of them in such an inaccurate way. Not only inaccurate, but a deliberate twisting of the truth. Ms. Diamant should have made her book truly a fiction and named her characters after non-Biblical people."
3,not that great,"Anita Diamant could have and should have done better research. A lot of the things she puts into the book are not Biblically correct. First, she says that Naphtali is Jacob's son with Leah, but Naphtali is the son of Bilhah and Jacob. Second, Diamant changed around the story of Joseph in Potiphar's house by saying that Joseph and Potiphar were male lovers and that when Potiphar's wife tried to get Joseph to go to bed with her, Diamant said that Joseph did! These things are not true!It was interesting to read, save for the historical mistakes made by Ms. Diamant."
5,I loved this book,"This was the best book that I have read this year. My daughter begged me to read it, and I finally gave in just to appease her. I loved the characters, and I was so sorry when the book was completed. I loved this book."
2,bubblegum for brains,"would have enjoyed sneaking this book around to all my girlfriends--in SIXTH GRADE! I couldn't get over how sophomoric the writing was--it was funny. Sometimes, she just clobbers you over the head. I would cite some examples here, but I read it a few years ago, and can't remember any. If you just want to pass time, this book will fit the bill, as the overdose of sentimentality will make you forget how bad the writing is."
1,A Most Overrated Book that took Ridiculuous Liberties,The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit the so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.I wish I could get my money back on this book.
1,Worse than one star!,"I am very surprised to see good reviews for this book. There is not an ounce of depth to any given character....all surface garbage and sex that amounts to a loathesome soap opera with a pitiful ending. If you have an ounce of Jewish or Christian pride you will be disgraced by Diamant's portrayal of Biblical men and women of God. Her history is so skewed that she can't even manage to get the names or the lineage correct on the first page of the book (for example Jacob's son Simeon is ""Simon"" and some of his children are listed with the wrong mother, or made into twins when they weren't). I was shocked to see that she has written books on Judaism since she has no respect whatsoever for her true heritage. This book is nothing more than a garbage romance novel that is not worth the waste of money."
5,Wow!,This book is awesome! A little graphic in parts-but shows life in great detail from a time period so different from us. Women get a whole different perspective of their roles in life from what they are now. The research done for this book was outstanding and very eye opening!I highly recommend it for women who want to understand the Bible more in that time period.
4,Awesome insight into biblical times,"What a fascinating read. Not an arresting page-turner, but very compelling, and a great view into what life was like during Ruth's time. I recall it vividly 1-year-later, which is an amazing feat for me -- and I would recommend it to anyone curious about life ""back then"" or rusty (and interested) in Bible stories."
5,From a Woman's Point of View,"Imagine the Bible stories you were told as a child retold from a woman's point of view. They're actually better retold this way--and it follows the stories in Genesis--only in a more intimate way.This book is beautifully written and captures your attention--right after you get over all the ""begets"". Use the genealogy chart at the beginning of the book, find a comfortable chair and read and read--and then cry when it's over!"
5,A must read for women of all ages!,I first read this book years ago and have returned to it many times. Like Dinah I am was blessed with strong women in my life and now have equally strong female friends. It is a comfort to see that the unity and sisterhood has survived through so many generations and world events.
5,a must read for those of all ages,"All I can say is wow. I was recommended this book by a colleague. I took her recommendation and read it, and I don't regret a thing. I'm not very religious, so I didn't understand the biblical references, but I enjoyed the book for the picture of women in biblical times it painted. This book had a very calming effect on me. This may sound cliche, but it reminded me of the things that really matter in life, like building strong relationships that stand the test of time, not only with the opposite sex, but with your own. Some people may not have liked the graphic descriptions of menstruation and childbirth, but I thought these descriptions only added to the earthy and natural feeling of the novel. I'm not going to spoil the end of it for you: you have to read it yourself.happy reading!"
5,The Red Tent,This book offers a heartbreaking account of the silencing of the female narrative in the development of the Hebrew tradition.
1,Not really a biblical story,"While I really did not care for this book, my biggest problem is how they sell it as biblical fiction when it has so little in common with the Bible. As the reviewers before have noted, there is alot of paganism among the women, the ""goddess"" cult and ""girl power"" type stuff. The men are generally shown as capable of a few good moments, but mostly as self-serving and uncaring men. Besides the mismarketing, I was just bored by the book. Perhaps because I was expecting something to motivate me spiritually or at least excite me with great storytelling, but this book failed on all accounts. The writing style itself is not so bad, simply done and not overly descriptive but the story is a flop. Pass this one by in favor of The Robe or Quo Vadis or anything with more depth."
2,Book Club reading,Some one in our book club recommend this for us to read. It just was not my kind of book. It does make you see what women went thru back in that time but I wouldn't recommend it myself for someone else to read.
4,A page-turner,"A really interesting read. I found this story fascinating, entertaining, and well-written. Couldn't put it down."
3,Brooklynstar*,"This book is a nostalgic sad story of scorn women. It just shows you how hard women had it through out the history. Even though the story is fiction, still feels very real. You can't help feeling sorry for the heroin and sympatize with all the hardship she had in her life. It was much deserved hapiness at the end. It was ironic she suffered and gave up a lot for her son and they just grew apart so much at the end.I am so glad woman has better options in life today. But, in some parts of the world they still live the story of Dinah."
3,"Insightfull, yet slow.....","I didn't know what to expect from this book when I started reading it. And not being very knowlegeable on the Old Testament I wasn't very familiar with some of the traditions mentioned in the book. I found myself looking at the family tree at the beginning of the book constantly trying to remember all the characters. It was pretty slow reading and I got tired of reading over and over again about all the births taking place in the red tent. If you got extra time in your hands, read it, it takes you to a very interesting time in the world."
4,Wonderfully written but VERY depressing....,"As a work of historical fiction, this book is excellent. It's engaging and written in a very conversational tone that was easy to follow. The main characters were also written with a great deal of emotion and depth, and you as a reader see them as the narrarator does. It's paced in a way that makes you really not want to stop and put it down.Besides some of the other things other reviewers have brought up re: the downsides of this book, the one thing I would warn any potential readers about The Red Tent is that it is very, VERY depressing. Do not read this book if you are not in a good mood because it will most certainly NOT cheer you up. It is not by any means a happy, 'feel good' kind of story.Despite the rather depressing story I still got wrapped up in the book, with its descriptiveness and language, and after all, that's why we read in the first place! An excellent choice for adults who love historical fiction."
5,A surprisingly good read,"This powerful book takes the story of Jacob, his four wives, and his many sons from the Bible and tells it from his daughter, Dinah's perspective. Don't be surprised if many of the characters you know from the Bible are not as you remember them in this story. The chain of events remain the same, but the female perspective is very different, and made me wonder how other Biblical stories would be seen through a woman's eyes. This story is also about the sacred relationship between mothers and daughters. Having lost my own mother last year, I cried throughout much of this story, remembering my own mother daughter relationship. This book is strongly recommended."
5,"Awesome, empowering new look at ancient women","I thoroughly enjoyed The Red Tent. I've not grown up with religion, so my enjoyment of the book was not at all hindered by feeling that it was sacrilege. I thought this novel was a very moving, creative, and empowering attempt to tell the story of what life might have been like for women caught in the fold between pagansim and judaism.This is a great book for people who are interested in learning more about positive female rituals and becoming more comfortable with women's natural bodily rhythms and functions. This book celebrates the beauty of the goddess in every woman, while also appreciating the strong, wise, and competent aspect of our natures.Read this book and create your own Red Tent and celebrate the first moon blood of every girl in your life."
2,Change of course?,"When you write a novel everybody knows it's a novel. When you write a true story is the same. The problem begins when someone wants to write a novel from a true story and here everybody knows the Jacob's story as is written in the Bible so here are the flaws:You don't have to explain every little detail as it is written in the Bible and then explain the same as you wish it were. You can give a general description and then write something of your own but without changing the main story.You can't change what happened so why trying to do it by writing a different thing?You can write an unbias or funny or sad explanation of a true story depending in your point of view, but to change the core of what really happened?Of course nobody knows for sure what exactly happened 5,000 years ago but no one have found the Bible as untrue."
2,Trashes Jewish history for New Agery and a Joseph rip-off,"Diamant actually had me until she started cribbing way too much from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat for this re-imagining of the Biblical rape of Dinah in the Book of Genesis. She ravages Jewish history in order to play on the cuddly notion that menstruation (I'm sorry, ""our moon time"") is a spiritual event that binds all women together - making Diamant a perennial book club favorite among women to whom I do not wish to be bound (shared biological functions notwithstanding). It doesn't help that Diamant keeps forgetting Dinah is telling her story in the first person, which she continues to do even when Dinah is not, technically, in the scene. The fourth wall breaks most painfully when Dinah describes her own death."
5,WONDERFUL!,"Even though it took too much concentrating to keep the names straight sometimes, this was a great read. I can't believe it took me 2 years to discover this book!"
2,The Red Tent,"This book quickly became tiresome as one realized that the main action in the book revolved around the bodily functions of the tribal women - bleeding, breeding and birthing. In the first half of the book all of the men, with the exception of one lone husband who didn't last long, were cruel beasts who had no use for their women (other than sex and food) and no interest in their female children. Is one to draw the conclusion from this book that the men of the old testament were self-centered brutes who treated women as chattel? I think so."
4,A well-told story,"I genuinely liked this book. Although some of it felt like a 1990's woman version of what might have happened in Biblical times and not entirely in keeping with the era, the story was well-told and kept my interest. It did make me want to learn more about the Bible, though, which was important."
5,The Red Tent,"I LOVED this book. I don't know when I enjoyed a book more. For someone who is NOT religious this is just terrifis storytelling. I enjoyed the fact that the book as a good pace to it, it doesn't rush at the end to ""tidy"" up the ending. Dinah is a fascinating character, as is her whole family. If you enjoy a good tale, read The Red Tent!"
5,"To every Woman, Please read this book.","The story embraces the life of every woman, from birth to the celebration when becoming a woman at the age of menstration, to partnership and love, and of course finally to death.Anita Diamant opens the heart of the reader and rekindles the need for all women to honour themselves in the present day, to embrace and celebrate the feminine spirit.THIS BOOK IS A TRUE CELEBRATION TO ALL WOMEN!"
4,Amen!,A wonderfully different historical fiction novel from a woman's perspective in biblical times. Fascinating and engrossing. Will not disappoint. Jacob is the man!
4,Interesting perspective,"I liked the fact that it was an interesting take on a familiar work of fiction (the Bible). I have no idea how much it strayed from it and didn't care. It was a good book.Interestingly, the taking of many wives reminded me of Mormon religion (read ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" for an eye opening read). But luckily, you do not need to be religious to enjoy this book.Some compared this book to ""Snowflower and the Secret Fan"". I found that book to be much better. This one wasn't bad... just not as good."
4,"Interesting premise, great story","Extrapolating an entire, colorful life's story from one brief mention in the Old Testament poses a big challenge. Meeting the challenge with an engaging, well-researched novel is an even bigger accomplishment.My book group read this recently and gave it a big ""thumbs up"". Each reader responded to different aspects of the book, but they all enjoyed it because it really is a great read: well-rounded characters, interesting plot, finely told details. Consensus of the group: ""It took us to a time and place where we'd never been.""If you've got a biblical bent, the story of Rachel and Leah (as it might have been) will be fleshed out for you, and you'll get a new look at the relationship Joseph (coat of many colors) might have really had with his brothers.Even if you're not up on the Old Testament, you can enjoy this sprawling story of a family just as it is."
3,good book club read,"This book is a fast read. It is not particularly remarkable in terms of its intellectual or philosophical content. It does, however, raise a number of interesting issues re: women's role in society, the bible/religion both in the past and currently and is likely to provoke good discussion/conversation among women-oriented book clubs. Good for the beach, too."
5,Giving splendid voice where there had been silence,"I have been a fan of Diamant's non-fiction wedding and baby books for a while, but when my sister-in-law gave this to me with the instructions ""You HAVE to read this,"" I fell in love with her fiction.This is a glorious story giving a possible voice to female characters of the Bible where before we have heard almost exclusively from the men. From the opening ""We have been lost to each other, you and I..."" to the end where we must say good bye, I was captivated by the spell of this story. It is a woman's story filled with all the joys and pains of growing up and going from maiden to mother to crone. It is all of our story.I have recommended this book to countless girlfriends (who have continued to recommend it!)and even strangers in bookstores. And now to you I also recommend you take the opportunity to get lost in the luciousness of Diamant's and Dinah's world."
5,Genesis: Two Outstanding Books; Two Different Genres,"The Red Tent is an excellent novel that breathes new life into the ancient heroes and heroines of the Book of Genesis. An outstanding companion to the Red Tent is the well-written and less known, The Genius of Genesis: A Psychoanalyst and Rabbi Examines the First Book of the Bible (nonfiction) by Dennis G. Shulman. Read these books together, as I just did, and you'll certainly see things in the Genesis text and yourself that you have never seen before."
4,fascinating look at biblical period from new perspective,"I would echo the thoughts of many other Amazon reviewers: finished it hungrily, want more from Diamant, want to tell other people to read it... I am unchurched, though familiar with basic outline of judeo=christian bible. For me, this story brings us back to pre-church, pre-synagogue and makes the link to the women who shaped culture. The book leaves you wanting more. Story fizzles near the end, but well worth the slow points. The story also left me wanting to delve more into new/very old religions based on lunar cycles and pre-christian worship."
2,Luke-warm fiction,"I didn't think I would ever get through this book, a selection of my book discussion group. I started off really interested in the story, partly because it was initially intriguing and also because there was so much hype surrounding the book. The author attempts to weave a tapestry of Dinah's life but dwells too long on details extrinsic to her own existence. For example, there was great detail given to descriptions of birthing. I failed to see where this affected Dinah's life...especially those births that occured before her own. At any rate, the book was enjoyable to a certain extent. The first half wore on like something I was forced to read against my will in grade school. The last statement in the book, as it turns out, is the most powerful literarily speaking. Too bad you have to wade through so much muck to get the reward..."
5,A Beautiful Powerful Surprise,"I expected to struggle with this book, but was very much surprised by the ease of the writing/reading and the powerful story. I loved this book. I read about 24 books a year and this is the best book I've read this year. I've never read Biblical Fiction before. My other favorites of the past few years have been Stones from the River and Memoirs of a Geisha."
5,The Red Tent,This is the best book I have read in a long time. I enjoyed every single page and was sad to see it end. Amazing the imagination from one single paragraph written in the bible.
5,A great piece of fiction,"A wonderful book overall and a nice job at a very popular theme --giving voice to minor characters. I was surprised that this was not a particularly biblical book. The seed of Judaism is only a small part of the story, and the God of the Bible has no real presence. This is why I do not agree with some reviewers who are upset with the book as ""not historical fiction,"" or somehow lacking true biblical knowledge. While I believe Ms Diamant is very familiar with the stories on which this is based, I also believe she was writing fiction - a story from the perspective of a woman at the turn of the 21st century. I found the story compelling and extremely readable."
2,Historical drama,"Brittle preconceptions are largely dispelled within the pages of this warm, wise tale which aims to lift the lid on the secret, precious world of mothers, sisters and daughters."
5,Excellent!,This book was excellent. It was completely entertaining and entirely believable. I am madly searching for other books by this author.
1,Why all the fuss?,"I read ""The Red Tent"" several months ago and wondered ""why all the fuss"". I was reluctant to recommend it to my book club, but, someone else mentioned they had heard good things about the book, so, read we did. After the second time, I feel exactly the same way - why bother? - the rest of my group were even less enthusiastic."
1,Disappointing--I expected more richness and depth,"Can Ms. Diamant write well? Absolutely! Is the story compelling? Yes. But given that she has written a half dozen books on Jewish life I was expecting a story about the richness of Jewish history--something that would be fitting of the patriarchs and their women. I realize that they were far from perfect, but nonetheless, they grasped their faith well enough to hand it down the generations to reach to the twenty first century. Yes, Jacob's wives worshiped the Mesopotamian gods of the time, but I think that he had to have explained his own developing faith in his God to his wives and children, and that didn't come through in this story. Furthermore, I expected that Diamant would describe what to me is the crux of Dinah's life story; the struggle children have with adopting their parent's faith versus finding their own faith. She missed out by not elaborating this timeless dilemma--thus creating an interesting, but rather superficial story."
2,This book was just too much,"I was drawn in by the premise of the book, about the little-known Dinah from the bible. It is fascinating how the author takes this sentence and produces a whole novel and life for Dinah----it reminded me alot of how the book Ahabs Wife was written about a woman mentioned in about two sentences in Moby Dick. Like Ahabs wife,this added a new dimension to the original story. This book is fairly fast-paced and easy to read, and spoken in the first person which I am partial to.However, I must say I was disgusted by the detail in the graphic parts......I can see once or twice, but the descriptions of bodily functions got downright redundant. I agree with the readers who compared this to a romance novel.Be prepared for this if you should choose to pick this book up.All I have last to say is to the reader ""Moon"" below me----maybe you need to take a dictionary and memorize the word ""opinion""......and realize that people JUST MIGHT have a different one from yours."
2,Sacrilegious to an LDS,"Too sexually disrespectful to me towards women. I do love the Bible story, however, I did not like how the author added so much sex into this book...to me, it was very sacrilegious the wonderful Bible story."
4,"The Perfect Gift For A Mother, Daughter, Sister, or Aunt","Anita Diamant does a great job of retelling the story of Dinah from the book of Genesis. The story is told in Dinah's voice and from the point of view of the women around her. This is a story about mothers, daughters, husbands, and sons. I specifically liked the details about the food and farming, social organization, and medical practices of the time. I was able to easily imagine the caravans, midwives, artisans, and slaves.This would be a difficult read for those who take the bible literally -- but for me, it makes me wonder what the bible would read like if it were written by women.This is a clever idea -- I like it when a author retells a story from a different perspective. I recommend Sena Jeter Naslund's, ""Ahab's Wife"" and Jeanne Rhy's, ""Wide Sargasso Sea"" if you are interested in a different perspective from either of the classic tales: ""Moby Dick"" or ""Jane Eyre."""
1,Fit only for kindling,"This book does a horrible diservice to the Word of God. Among other things, it had quite a few significant Biblical inaccuracies in it. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had premarital sex. The Bible doesn't depict Joseph as bisexual. The book portrays God as cruel, glorifies pagan goddesses, and describes bestiality by the shepherds. The author didn't even try to base the book on the Bible (but felt it was okay to ""borrow"" their characters). When I looked at Anita Diamant reader's notes for the book, she states ""My research focused on the everyday life of women in this period of history, in the ancient Near East. I did not study the Bible or rabbinic sources, but concentrated instead on the food, clothing, social organisation, architecture, and medicine of the era (c. 1500 BCE)."" The sad thing is some people will read the book and mistakenly think it is Biblically accurate."
2,Not a true Christian Fiction,"While this book is beautifully written and presents a unique persona-point-of-view, it does not fit into the category of Christian Fiction by definition. Most Christian fiction presents a person in situations that lead him into a more intimate relationship of God and Christ. While this book portrays interesting facts about cultural practices of societies in Biblical times, it does not do as I described above. It also greatly deviates from the Biblical descriptions of Jacob and his family. Rebecca was not a pagan prophetess and Joseph was not a petty man full of himself and his power while a vizier of Egypt. I don't believe this book should be listed under the category of Christian fiction. It is misleading."
3,good for the girls,wife asked me to read. a good girls book. If you like girl movies this book is for you.
1,FICTION! not historically accurate!,"I agree with the voices who are displeased with this book. WHile Ms. D. is a talented writer, she did not research this book accurately at all. The book has a huge anti-male bias. In fact, the only men who are portrayed positively are Shechem (the rapist), Esav (a murderer she describes as a ""baby-faced cutie"") and Dina's eventual Egyptian lover. It is interesting to note that Ms. Diamant is married to a convert. Maybe she does't like Jewish men? (In her book they are all stupid, spaced-out, smelly, sexually selfish, and self-centered). I wish she would have read Genesis before writing this. It is completely fictional, and not at all reflective of what occurred, namely the rape of a CHILD! (Dina was 8 at the time)"
2,Altered and sometimes perverted,"I chose to read this book, because I usually love fictional stories that elaborate on Bible stories. I like to imagine what it must have been like had I actually lived at that time. However, I was disappointed with this book, because the known Biblical facts were altered--several of them. The only known Biblical fact concerning Dinah, the main character of the book, is that she was raped. This is not the story line. Another reason that I did not like this book was that the father of the nation of Israel, Jacob, is not presented in a light that I would say was respectable. If you are considering this book for a ""Christian"" read, think again. The facts are altered, even perverted at times, and the One True God is overshadowed in this book by other gods and idols worshipped by the women of the Red Tent."
1,"If you like poor writing and soap operas, this is for you.","In sophomoric prose, the author attempts to recreate what life was like for women in Biblical times. For example, the phrase she uses to describe women nursing their children is ""giving suck."" It describes the story of Dinah who had sexual relations with Sechem outside of marriage. Later Sechem and his father Hamar try to make reparations offering both the traditional bride price for Dinah and a marriage between Dinah and Sechem. Jacob, Dinah's father agrees. Later, Dinah's brothers renege and kill Hamor's male relatives and steal their worldly possessions. This does not portray the Israelites in a very good light by modern sensibilities. But it does open an interesting anthropological window on the times. This is a far more interesting story to google than to get out of this dreary chick-lit attempt at historical fiction."
2,Biblical Tour De Force Is Offensive to Religious People,"To all religious Jews and conservative Christians who are considering reading ""The Red Tent"", I issue a warning: you will find the premise of this book deeply offensive, as I have. It takes the biblical narratives of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish people and twists them so that Jacob, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah are portrayed as idolaters who worship Mesopotamian gods and have only the basest possible morality. It is a feminist ""retelling"" of one of the chief stories of Genesis, presenting biblical men in the worst possible light, with Jacob as a greedy, lustful, misogynistic self-seeking weakling. The historical accuracy of this book is also practically non-existant; Rachel is made a blonde, which is obsurd considering that she lived in ancient Mesopotamia, which is today modern Iraq. One of the few saving graces of this book is that the writing is superb; but it is not enough to convince you to wade through this river of lies."
4,the 13th tribe?,"maybe dinah falls to the backround like Jephtha's daughter in the Torah, but here in Diamant's novel, Dinah is very much in the fore ground, narrating the story of Jacob from her point of view. If you have ever wondered about the women of the bible, who are merely glazed over, you will thouroughly enjoy this book. (an extra star if you ever went to Hebrew school, attend Shul on Pesach, or could name the 12 tribes in your sleep)"
4,A Winner!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It has a great story, and the writing is very good. The vivid descriptions really make you feel that you were there. When ""Deena"" spends years in isolation, you actually feel the boredom and time slipping away. I'm not sure why I don't rate this 5 stars--it doesn't quite make my list of the very best books I've ever read. Maybe because of the ending--it seemed a bit lackluster and not in pace with the rest of the book."
1,Was not impressed with the content,"I started reading this book thinking it would give a visual of the Bible brought to life through the eyes of women. However, I could not get into it as after several chapters I felt it was soft porn for women. This is the second time I attempted this book. I tried several years ago after it was recommended to me and put it down within a few chapters. I now remember why I did not finish the book.The author does a great job from what I read of giving the characters personality, so this is not an opinion on the authors skills, but I just personally did not enjoy the details of the sexual aspects and truly felt it could be rated as soft porn for women."
3,Interesting but disturbing,"""The Red Tent"" is at once fascinating but also disturbing. I found the depiction of everyday life in Biblical times intriguing. I had never really thought about what life was like for the men and women of that time and so I enjoyed learning about it. What I found disturbing was that none of the male characters were ever developed beyond just basic information about them. You never got to know any of them as people so they were one dimensional, autocratic and shown as totally disregarding the feelings or thoughts of the women in the camp beyond wanting them for sex and baby production. You were never given any insight to why they believed in the one God of Abraham or that they ever taught or shared with the women about it. That seemed totally unrealistic to me and made me feel the book was not very authentic. In all, great portrayal of some of the aspects of life in those times, but very incomplete because it was so one-sided. I really felt it portrayed men unfairly."
4,Entretaining and touching,"Diamant did a great job researching the life of women in biblical times and presenting it to us in this novel. In spite of the time and place being so far away from our contemporary existence, the human condition and in this case, the sense and concerns of women are the same now as they were then. I enjoyed this book very much, had a hard time putting it down and I imagine all women who've had children, who've left their parents country and/or who have strong relationships with other women will enjoy this tale. I will never think of Jacob the same way. Too bad there were no women writters in biblical times, we would have had much richer and detail stories of those times, such as The Red Tent. Bravo for Diamant. Waiting for your next book."
3,Skewed Bible Story,"The beginning was little slow for me, even though it was interesting to get a glimpse of the daily lives of the ancient biblical time women. It got really interesting in the middle of the book 'til the end. But I was offended about the portrait of Joseph in the book. Joseph is my favorite biblical character and the author portrayed him as a bisexual and illiterate person who got lucky to be a high rank governor in Egypt. Also, she distorted the Bible story about the main character, Dinah, who was raped in the Bible but not in this book. That totally changes the whole story and makes the biblical charaters barbarian and cruel. This is like Da Vinci Code which makes you wonder about the originality of the Bible. Like the author mentioned, it's only a novel, a fiction, far from the truth. We could make up any story and that's what the author did. It was entertaining but unbelievable."
2,i just didn't get it,"i must have been the last woman in the world to read it. all i heard from women (whose literary opinions i usually respect and agree with) was ""RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!"" even when i was reading it-- carrying it around visibly, strangers would stop me on the city streets of chicago and say ""RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!"" and now that i've read it, i can't agree. with everyone going on and on about it, i expected a ""Lovely Bones"" experience -- one of those rare gift reads when all you think about is the book, and you can't wait to get back to it. not so. *sigh* i just didn't get it."
1,Hit and Miss,The arrival time was awesome! But half way through book/disc's they began to skip. So I am bummed to have to fast forward threw parts and miss chunks of the book.
1,Just awful.,"Didn't know what I was getting myself into. Not my cup of tea. Made several attempts to read and just coudn't do it. Other than the difficulty in actual context and characters (remembering names, etc) I just DID NOT CARE about any of them to keep reading or try to comprehend. And I wanted to like it. But nope, not even a little bit. Did not finish."
1,Did this author ever actually read the Torah??,"I was interested to read this book after I read the blurb on the back, but was appalled at the writer's ignorance after just the first chapter. I don't think she has ever actually read the Torah, and clearly she is not a practicing Jew, or she would know that we never, EVER, cook a lamb in milk. She would know, too, that none of the matriarchs or patriarchs would ever do this either, since they followed halacha (Jewish law) even before Moses received the Torah. Her storyline was so far gone from anything rooted in Torah (Dinah clearly was raped, so I doubt she could love the rapist), it makes me embarassed that she calls herself a Jew. Don't waste your time with this trash."
2,A very disappointing book,"I had high expectations for this book, but it was flat and insipid. The author rearranged historical fact to suit her story and in the end, it just wasn't interesting at all."
1,Too much sex...a smear of bible character.,This is NOT a book that a true Christian should read. If you love Jesus and you want to keep your mind pure and clean don't even borrow it from the library. I hope none of my children (even the grown ones) ever get ahold of anything like this! It's porn! It's trashy! What would Jesus do? Burn it! It made me sick for weeks and I didn't even read it all. This should never have carried the label of biblical fiction. The was nothing biblical about it but for some of the names.
2,I greatly disliked it.,"""The Red Tent: A Novel"" left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I honestly cannot pinpoint why I dislike it, but I deeply know that I do dislike it with a passion. I do not like the fictional liberties author Anita Diamant took, and felt she toyed with Biblical matters. And even though she is Jewish and holds many degrees pertaining to the religion, I felt she didn't tell the Jewish side of the story well. I'm disappointed - I do not recommend."
1,Disappointing,"I could only read 40 pages of this book. It started out to be interesting, yet the vivid description of sexual encounters left me feeling disheartened and dirty. Why do authors feel that such elaboration is necessary? I am a Christian and love the Bible. I felt that I was reading a vile, slanderous report about people I believe lived and I hope to meet in Heaven one day. The author takes great liberties with the Biblical account. Liberties that I find disgusting. The Lord orchestrated the facts in a far more interesting manner than is portrayed in 'The Red Tent'. I could not continue reading this book and then say 'the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' without blushing. I hope the best for the author but it is best not to even start this book."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I know that everyone raves about this book, but I just thought it was incredibly hard to stomach. For starters, it is poorly written and, at many points, seems contrived. The language is very basic, dull and uninteresting. At some points, she even attempts to throw in some old English to make it feel like Biblical times. Also, the plot line is really difficult to fathom. I am not saying that I disagree with anything she is saying, but, again, the book seems really commercial. It's almost as if an editor came up with the idea, put someone else to work and then forgot to pick someone literate enough to make a lucid point. She is clearly not someone who experienced college and the incredible torrents of college professors beating her essays and general writings to a pulp. Can anyone write a book these days? Maybe I should get started on my novel!"
1,Don't bother -,"Oh stop it. A pathetic book about a time when women were viewed as less than real people, and accommodated the male world to their own personal detriment. It was awful."
1,A Misconception,"I bought this book with the preconception that it was ""christian fiction"". I was disappointed to find that the storyline does not keep the integrity of the Bible and I would consider it secular fiction. If you are a true Christian fiction reader, I would not reccommend this book."
2,The Red Tent,"This book was slooooooooooooooow! It is 321 pages long and it took to page 205 to even get slighltly interesting. It was very difficult to read this book as a christian. It departs so far from the Bible. If you don't know the characters in the story from the Bible well, you will be very misled! I understood that the book was fictional but why change Bible facts around? It was fine for the author to write about Dinah anything she wanted because she really isn't expounded upon in the Bible but for the author to make Rebecca into some high priestess was going abit far.Aside from changing the Bible truths all around the story was rather sad. The main character Dinah lives a miserable life and in the end she isn't even remembered by her father or brothers which she grew up with.I don't think I'll read anymore books based loosely on the Bible."
2,A woman's point of view is not enough,"Just because the Old Testament is rarely approached from a woman's point of view does not, in itself, provide enough reason to recommend this book. It came highly recommended, and understandably so, given Diamant's ability to turn a phrase. The repeated descents into bestiality, vulgarity and abuse took the place of a plot, and ruined what might have otherwise been a remarkable book."
1,What a disappointment.,"Having read a few reviews on this book I thought it was going to be a wonderfully edifying book, based on the Dinah of the Bible.It is not.The author seems fixated on sex, in various forms: bestiality, incest, you name it, she included it. The book is not in the least biblically accurate, and the liberties the author takes with the characters, events and timeline is sickening."
2,Promising but Blasphemous,"Despite being well written and having a very interesting premise, this book was a disappointment overall. Considering how the bible, especially in Genesis, covers hundreds of years within a handful of pages - there is a lot of room for exploration, and even some creative license with such fiction. However, to take figures beloved by the Jewish and Christian communities, and to add things contrary to their known characteristics, is apt to upset some as it did me. Jacob was portrayed as an idolatrous and cowardly man. Sure, he wasn't perfect in real life, but I do wish the author had stayed a bit more true to the Jacob of the Hebrew Scriptures. There was plenty else she could've, and in some cases, did do - to be interesting."
4,What could have been...,"Dinah, only daughter of Old Testament Jacob, narrates this story of her mother Leah's meeting her father, Leah's feelings of inferiority towards Rachel, the foolishness of Laban and the growth of her family. Once Dinah is born, the story switches to her life and in particular, and her relationship with her mothers (father's wives) during their time of month in the Red Tent, her brothers, and even her grandmother Rebecca. I enjoyed the author's colorful characterizations of these familiar names and the way she made it easy to visualize the arid environment where they lived and traveled. Though Dinah was only mentioned twice in Genesis, this book does a marvelous job of building a whole personality and story about this woman who endures such terrible hardship but promptly disappears from the pages of history."
2,A Feminist Fictional Account,"This book was a huge disappointment. If you're looking for a book using fiction to fill in the gaps of the scriptural account of Dinah, this book fails miserably. It, in many instances, contradicts scripture and adds some strange ideas of what may have happened (for example; insinuating that Joseph and Potiphar had a sexual relationship)as if the biblical account wasn't interesting enough without adding to it. This book IS well written in style, plot and character development, but it painted all of the men mentioned in scripture in a very negative light while remaining sympathetic to every woman. The Red Tent was not at all what I had hoped for. My advice to the reader is to get it at your local library if you must read it and save yourself a few dollars."
5,A must read,"This book is a great read. I had a hard time getting into the characters in the beginning, especially given the husband sharing that goes on. After I finished it, however, I couldn't stop thinking about it and went back to reread passages! It is beautifully written and one of the best I have read in a long time."
5,A Breath-taking story!,"I didn't expect as wonderful a story as I found in The Red Tent. I always wondered how women lived during early biblical times, and Diamant presented a plausible story of how these tribal women lived and relied on each other. The characters are well developed and their stories sweep you into their lives and experiences. The reader must remember that the book is fiction, and not meant to be taken as a literal interpretation of the Bible."
5,Wonderful!,"I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women. We are a certain way with each other today, and we were the same with each other over two thousand years ago. That is the real beauty of this book for me. I think Anita Diamant did a remarkable job in capturing the essence of life for women B.C. She made me contemplate what it would have been like to not only know the story of Abraham and Issac, but to know both men as family members. To have known Rebecca as a grandmother! My goodness. I am not a Biblical scholar, but she brought this era to life for me. In short, it's a wonderful book and I recommend it highly."
5,This book is a keeper,"When a friend recommended this book to me, I thought oh yeah, another Biblical book that goes nowhere and preaches at you. Well, after reading the first paragraph, I must say, I was wrong. The words and stories of each of Jacob's women weave together into a beautiful tale. And Anita brought the past to life ~~ with its dusty reality, not this purified pretty version that the Bible gives out. (How can you really span a life story of one man and his family and not use up more than a thousand pages?) Anita writes about all points of views and shows the reality of life back then. She also writes about the enduring relationships women have with one another. This is one book I am planning to buy for my closest girlfriends as it celebrates friendship, love and family. And when I finished the book, I felt as if I lost a new set of friends. This book is well-written and embraces the reader into Dinah's life. And leaves the reader with haunting images from time past."
5,"A must read for lovers of ""chick books""","A brilliant, brilliant book. You feel like you are part of these peoples lives from start to finish. The characters are so vivid, you get a real sense of how they lived. And Dinah, the central character is an inspiration to all women. I think the Red Tent concept is a good one, somewhere we can go to bond with our fellow women, where we won't be disturbed by the hurlyburly of everyday life, husbands and children included...I say bring it back. I loved this book, enough to read it a second time."
4,Wonderful Read,"I'm super picky (at least it seems that way the last few years) and I've been reaching back for old books I've never read. Just finished Lonesome Dove and now The Red Tent. Really enjoyed this book, poetic in an unassuming way...does that make sence? Also a quick enjoyable read."
4,INTERESTING,"I found this fictional rendition of an old Bible history interesting. I was not cought up in its accuracy as much as how the author imagined the people would feel, react, and behave at that time. To that end, the book added also to my insight. While I thought the preoccupation with sex was excessive, perhaps tribal people who were concerned about their very survival and existance were more focused on procreation. The author portrays the times as brutal, fairly lawless, and very sad - an interesting insight. The treatment of the God of Jacob (EL) was also enlightening. Sometimes the Biblical accounts abbreviate the process leading to devotion and worship of Jahweh. Noting that the god of the people was the one who promised the most and made good on that promise seemed to be a realistic development. The people were not focused on El but, at that time, working on developing an identity in the world whcih eventually lead to Judiasm."
5,The Red Tent,"A book you can read over again!!! I really enjoyed everything about this book. If you are familiar with the Bible, it was nice to read a different perspective to life in ancient times."
5,The Red Tent,"This is such an interesting novel. The similarities between customs from all different corners of the world are amazing. This is definetely a ""cant put it down"" book. I highly reccomend it to readers of all kinds of novels."
3,good but not accurate,"I thought the book was good in that it was well written. As to being accurate, it was not. I dont read books to pick them apart and be critical but there were some gross inaccuracies and as a Bible reader, they were blaring. Jacob worshipped one God and so did his wives Rachel and Leah, thats why he married them. They were his only wives. If you want an interesting book to read and arnt concerned with Biblical accuracy, this is a good book."
4,A nice change of perspective,"It doesn't matter if people say it isn't historically accurate: it is a beautiful story that helped me better define what it means to be woman and a mother. I think it would make a great movie if they kept close to the text. I recommend to anyone- male/female, any religion."
3,Hard to get through.,The 1st 200 out of 300 pages were so hard to get through. It was mostly about their everyday life. I told myself when I was 1/2 way through the book if the next 50 pages dont get any better I was going to lay it down. It did get much better. But the book could have been written in 150 pages.
5,A Mother's Point of View,"This book took me right to the sand. I could see it moving when I closed my eyes. The women, mothers really. That is all they were, but the sorrow and joy made it all worth it. This book changed me how I look at my children and what I would do for them. Anything and everything. The individual strength, determination. I would recommend this book to all women of today."
2,Too many characters,"There were too many characters and the author insisted on telling you exactly what every one of them was doing on every given moment of the day. I really wanted this book to be good and wanted to see where it was going to go, but I couldn't keep up with all the characters. Most of them seemed pointless. I put it down about half way through."
5,The Red Tent: A Novel,"Biblical days told from the women's viewpoint ... compassionate, understanding, thorough, sexy and the strength and comradery of women sharing feelings and dreams openly together in the red tent."
5,Wonderfully compelling and unique,"I loved this book for all the same reasons everyone else did, but I must add that it was very refreshing to read a book with such a unique format. The format of most stories and novels goes: 1. introduction 2. rising action 3. climax 4. falling action 5. resolutionHowever, ""The Red Tent"" has no rising action, so the climax hits you like a ton of bricks making for a very unpredictable story. Then, the story continues to rise and fall in very atypical undulations. I love this completely unpredictable format.One last remark I must make is that I appreciate how Diamant makes no bones about this book being ""based on"" or having a direct correlation to the stories in the bible. On the very first page of the book she cautions the reader that the stories and names in ""The Red Tent"" may be similar to those of the Bible, but she is in no way implying that they are true or should be believed."
2,Just not for me,"It may or maynot have been a good representation of life for women at that time, but it just did not appeal to me."
5,The Red Tent by Anita Diamant,Received the book quickly and was in new condition. I have purchased several books from Amazon and all were sent on time and in good condition. This book was purchased for a book club reading and review.
1,Like reading a biblical trash novel.,"Every person I knew praised this book. I thought to myself, why not, and give it a try. I felt that the idea behind it was good, but the literature read like reading a women's trash novel. I actually listened to this book on tape and at times I felt I had a soap opera on. If trash novels and soap operas aren't for you, skip this one."
5,Marvelous storytelling!,"What a compelling view of the women in the Old Testament! I was really impressed by Dinah's tenacity. Diamant intertwined reverence for our mothers, beautiful love stories, invincible friendships and difficult journeys in this novel. Keep a box of tissues nearby, and let yourself become entranced by Dinah's magical world."
2,"Looking to build your faith? Read the ""original""!","Though I did like the author's writing style I was disappointed to see my ""heroes in the faith"" from the bible trivialized and in most cases even distorted. The people who praised Ms. Diamante's insight into biblical events appear to me as not having read the ""original"". If she was trying to just write another story, she did a well enough job, but I don't think that this book will inspire women out there about God or his word - if anything, it will make them more cynical about the roots of judaism and christianity... I would not recommend the book to christian believers out there - some sexual parts are too graphic, and again, are trivializing people we admire...too bad, this story could have really made an impact!"
2,ABSOLUTELY NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION,"I was loving this book almost all the way through until, in her dramatic interpretation of the Biblical story of Rachel and Leah, the author COMPLETELY departed from Scripture!! Beware. She not only portrays Joseph as a homosexual, she has him actually succumb to Potiphar's wife- which is direct contradiction of the truth. Literary license is one thing, but changing the Word of God is dangerously another."
5,Best for believers,"It clearly helps to believe in G*d, and to have read the Bible, to suspend disbelief and live in this fully-realized story of Rebecca, Sarah, Rachel, and Leah, from Dinah's viewpoint. And to have a mental imprint of the terrain of modern and ancient Israel and the rest of the Middle East. The plausible story moves over terrain lately in the news, as it always has been in the news, since before the time of the Bible. Seculars who aren't feminists or interested in the relationships of men and women in a patriarchal society might find it unconvincing, possibly even ""disgusting"" as one reviewer put it, although that seems like an extreme reaction. If anything Diamant is delicate in her descriptions of daily life and love, and love wins out."
4,Really Good Book!,"I really liked this book. It did have a tendency to brush past many years to get to another point, but it really didn't hinder the story."
3,okay,"I quite like to read storys about women and that is what I got here. It was not the best book I ever read, but it could have been worse."
3,The Red Tent,"This book was not what I expected from reading the other reviews. This book is not Biblical!!! The only thing she took from the Bible were the names. It should be looked at as a TOTALLY fictional story. It was good reading until about half way through, then it got kind of slow."
1,Not for Christian readers,"This book does not accurately represent the Biblical stories it uses. If you are going to read it, I would recommend reading the scriptures that tell these stories before hand so you can see all of the embellishments the author added for what they are."
2,An Earthy Tale,"I cannot fault the writer on her unusual approach to the tale of Jacob's wives and the story of Dinah. However, the story seemed to be an unveiled advertisement for the Wicca religion instead of supporting the historical approach given in the Bible. By the time Dinah began her menses cycle and I labored through the graphic earthy account of thier pagan ritual my stomach was queasy. As a Christian I was offended that the ""bad"" guys were the men that opposed the pagantry. I would not recommend this book to anyone and am sorry I spent the money for my copy."
2,blasphemy,"this is a boring , drawn out, wrongly imaginative book. didn't capture my attention, overhyped and not that well written. why is it doing so well? i'm confused. as a woman who usually loves women's fiction, and as a christian who loves reading about christian fiction, i can say this book is not a good combination! read it if you want a book that helps you sleep."
1,Disappointing,"The Red Tent had great potential. The Bible contains many stories that when fleshed out could make wonderful novels, and Anita Diamant seems to have done quite a bit of research into the time period. But, she ultimately failed to enthrall me. I think the problem for me seems to have been that Anita Diamant has never met a righteous man or woman, and seems unable to imagine one. True, every human has weaknesses, but Ms. Diamant seems to think that all people have the weaknesses (and to the degree) that she portrays. This book is disappointing to those who expect prophets of God and their wives to act differently---to have at least some knowledge of God's commands and to be striving to be better or come closer to God."
2,a slow read,"This was an interesting book because I usually don't touch religous books at all, but it was different, hard to get through at the end however."
2,cheesy,"Take away the historical background and what have you got? A cheesy ""chick"" novel, not particularly well written. But at least the biblical connection -- gimmicky as it is -- gives the story a more interesting dimension."
1,Pregnancies and Periods,"I've read many of the other reviews and although I can't comment on the accuracy of the story or characters, I can comment to say that this is a very boring book. My mother said she loved it. I was excited to see that the book was about Jacob and his sons since I love the story of Joseph. But nothing much happens in this book until about page 206 of 336 pages. And even then, it's not all that exciting and not a lot comes of it. The book seems to be about women getting pregnant, not getting pregnant and having babies. What's the hype about? Skip this one."
3,"The story is okay, but should have left the Bible out of it","Taken on it's own as complete fiction it is a readable, enjoyable story about several generations of women told by one of them - Dinah. Personally I think she should have left the Biblical characters out of it since she took hardly a single fact from the Bible but their names. The story seems like a not very subtle attempt at denigrating men and the Judeo-Christian God in favor of the new age ""goddess"" mentality. If you read this book, do yourself the favor of not confusing it with anything written in the Bible."
3,Anti-God Slant,"Although I enjoyed the historical context of this novel, I was dismayed that much more attention was paid to the worshipping of false gods and very little to the worship and direction of God Himself. This makes the book read contrarily to the story in the Bible."
3,"Good Book, Not Christian or Biblical","This is a good book. It's a little graphic in places for my taste. The thing that bothered me the most is that it twists the facts given in the Bible in a negative way. It makes Jacob and Joseph far less admirable. There's no evidence of Christianity in the book, which I had hoped for. The author is Jewish? Other than that it was a great story. A far stretch from the story the Bible tells."
1,The Most Boring Book,"I was assigned to read this for an Old Testament class. This book was so boring that I literally started to cry because I didn't want to read another page. There is no plot! Just ramblings that go on and on and on. I'm not religious so I don't care if it's ""right"" I was just completely blown away because it literally bored me to tears."
2,Emotion Lost in Translation,"I'm one of a minority here but I failed to get past 1/4 of the way through the book. I really wanted to like it but it lacked enough emotion for me to continue on. I felt the writing was poor and dis-jointed. Like another reviewer said, it was every other sentence of ""so and so begat so and so"" as well as birth and after birth with very little emotion. The Red Tent had a great deal of promise but sadly failed to pull me in enough to keep going."
2,"Complete fiction, not a biblical account.","Although the book was an interesting read, it was very disappointing. It was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the Jewish/Christian faith. I will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible, but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying. There was no respect given to the God of Abraham and that I have to say was the most disappointing part. There are way better books that are interesting to read, give an accurate historical background, AND hold true to the integrity of the Word of God."
5,This is an engrossing story with compelling characters.,"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is an engrossing, well-researched story with compelling and believable characters. It is especially gratifying to find a sympathetic, detailed, and believable account of an Old Testament woman's life set in this era and part of the world. The story is told from the point of view of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, a successful nomadic sheep-herder. She is raised by four different women, all wives of Jacob and becomes a midwife. Through an intriguing and dramatic turn of the plot, she ends up in Egypt. The book was a pleasure for even this non-religious feminist to read. The images are riveting. The characters are memorable. I wish I were a screenwriter because the Red Tent would make a wonderful movie."
2,LibraryLady,"This book was good as a ""story"", however, read it with the understanding that is it a story told from the perspective that Dinah and none of the women in Jacob's life believed in God and only God. Don't read it thinking it will give you insight on the Bible. It will not."
5,Simply an astoundingly brilliant and beautiful book.,"As one who has studied Bible from both Jewish and Christian perspectives for many years, I can quite calmly and quietly assure the author's critics that she has indeed done a superb job reading, interpreting, and extrapolating the Bible to create this marvelous novel. Those crucial points of change in any culture and especially in this one, both so familiar and so wondrously strange to 21st century readers, and particularly the gradual move from matriachy to patriachy are endless fascinating. Ms. Diamant paints very humanely her ancient women and men and her conjecture as to what may have actually happened to Dinah and her family are likely close to the mark. The shared intimacy and consorority of these women is awesome and something we so lack today. Oh, the numerous scenes involving human sexuality are hot and raw, but never obscene. Please more and soon, Ms. Diamant. Truly a virtuoso effort!"
5,Captivating!,"The premise of this book is fascinating and very well-executed. Once I picked it up I was unable to put it down. Anita Diamant does an amazing job of recreating Biblical times through her writing (without it becoming a history lesson), and creates characters that captivate from the first page. Although based on a woman from the Bible, this is a read for everyone, religious or non. I loved this story of strong and beautiful women. This book is about women celebrating their womanhood and marking a plac in a male dominated time - it's an inspirational tale!"
4,I cried at the end.,"Normally I shy away from Biblically-based stories, being decidedly a-religious, but I found myself completely engrossed, and finished the book in a few short hours. This book is a touching story about female power, struggling against society, and finding oneself in the end. Brava!"
3,A Good Read on a Rainy Afternoon,"A very creative book and an easy read. Reading this book didn't change my life dramaticaly, but it was interesting nonetheless. It's a story told from a female perspective, and is set in the Biblical days. Worth reading on a lazy afternoon."
5,Have you ever wondered how the story ended?,"This is not a ""true"" story but it gives some insight into maybe how the story of Jacob's wives started and ended. It was an awesome book, one that I have read at least five times. You need to go into the book though and realize that it is fiction and just one way of looking at the story. This book actually went around our bible study group and everyone enjoyed it, as a great fiction book based off of scripture."
4,Great Read!,I found this book in the library and picked it up on a whim. I started to read and was blown away by the rich texture of the story.The premiss of the book fascinated me; tidea of reading about women who lived during Old testament time was excitig and new; the details of the period added rich color and life to these well known characters.I loved the book and am sad there was not more to hear from Dinah or the author. For similar premises I recomend works by India Edgehill.please visit me at BookDevour.blogspot.com
5,Great Book!,"Well researched historical fiction, from another point of view. This book is very well-written and truly enjoyable to read. I LOVED IT!! I laughed and cried, what a journey!"
4,Read it like a the novel that it is....,"This book was enjoyable, but not historically accurate. Had it not been called a novel, I would have given it less stars because it's clearly historically inaccurate. I guess ""based on a true story..."""
4,Revisiting my library...,"Was perusing the books in my library and deciding which I would pass on or reread someday.There is was...'The Red Tent', a gift from my daughter years ago. Certainly, I remembered how much I enjoyed this novel and how it gave me some understanding and knowledge of women and families in the Old Testament.Having read thru the Bible a number of times, it was a very enjoyable historical novel complement.I went to look at my review here on Amazon and alas! I didn't provide one.So here it is, better late than never, minus little minutiae that could have added to the review.A lot to be said when you decide to revisit a novel!"
1,The Ted Tent,"This was a great discussion book club choice for women.Alas, this exclude more than half of population.Characters were painted too simple, especially men. There was no rich Tapestry only cotton rags.It will provide discussion of many topics."
4,I liked it.,Although this book is a novel it brings Biblical characters more to life for me. The Bible is largely a book written by men and about God and men so it is nice to think about what life must have been like for women in biblical times. I would recommend it to anyone to is interested in history in biblical times. It is a well written easy read.
5,Best book I've read in years,"This book brings to life the many stories I heard as a child in Sunday School. I gave up religion many, many years ago. This book never mentions anything ""Christian""...in fact there are references to the other gods of the day...Isis, Enlil, Enki and so on. My life as a woman, mother, and now a grandmother has been affected in ways I could never have imagined by the reading of this beautifully written story. It swept me away and I made it last a week because I did not want it to end. I would love to read more period stories like this."
5,A whole new view of the family of Jacob,"Anita Diamant has brought to life the story of Dinah in a way that I had never considered before. It was an extremely good read, and when I revisited her story (Dinah) in the Bible, I found it to be true to the Word as much as a book of fiction could be. Thank you Anita for personalizing a story that is not told as often as it should be. I will be spreading the word about this book for years to come."
4,Not a circus tent!!,"Definitely a woman's book. Gave a deeply revealing insight to customs of that day and the place of women in that society. Not the picture I have of Joseph from my early Sunday School days, however. Made me feel that some history had been changed to fit the story line. Thoroughly enjoyable - I foundthe book easy to read and understand."
5,A must read!,This novel is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. I am not a student of the Bible so I had no preconceived notions going into this book. One of those books you don't want to put down.
5,Worth it!!!,"Ladies, you will not be disappointed with this one. I do not consider myself a religious person, or into history, so I didn't expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I did. It was laying around my mom's house and I just picked it up. I had heard of it but didn't really know much about it. I was sucked in immediately. It is about the bond women have, the importance of family and the role they play, the importance of tradition. And unlike so many other books, it is really not depressing, but uplifting. Be aware that it is pretty intense. The story is wonderfully told, and the characters are so real and detailed, you feel like you are right there with them. If I could give it more than five stars I would!!"
4,An interesting Tale!,"Initially I was reluctant to read this novel...and now I don't know why. This powerful novel tells the story of Jacob as seen through the eyes of his daughter, Dinah. The writing is so vivid and colorful that you stop breathing, especially in the last few pages, which will leave you in tears. Diamant cleverly gives you a traditional biblical story but in a new female perspective. It is definately a must read and you would not regret reading it."
5,Brilliantly written and totally engrossing...,"I read this book a few years ago, and have been recommending it to everyone! ""The Red Tent"" gives us such a revealing look into what life must have been like in the days of Genesis. Although this book revolves around biblical characters, please don't be intimidated. This book is rich in history, detail, and love. Anita Diamant celebrates womanhood and life with this incredible story. It is one of those books that simply must be read and talked about!"
4,A touching look at the lives of women in Biblical times,"I really enjoyed this book. Diamant does a good job of weaving together accounts in the Bible, history, and her own imiagination to create a story about women and what their lives might have been like during Biblical times. To those reviewers who have complained that The Red Tent does not mirror accounts in the Bible, my answer would be that this novel is a new creation, based loosely on the Bible and what we know of historical fact from this time period.The characters' lives illustrate the challenges women faced, including their positions and duties within the society, the limits that were foisted upon them, and the roles of both faith and special talents/gifts within their stories. Don't read this book expecting rote regurgitation from the Bible. Rather, be prepared for an imaginative, rich, and detailed story set during Biblical times and depicting some Biblical characters. A good read."
1,I Do NOT Recommend this book,"As a fairly conservative Christian and supporter of feminism, I am deeply offended by this book. The author takes broad liberties with the biblical family history of Leah and Jacob, and seems inclined to satisfy her own personal agenda. By doing so, Ms Diamant paints an unfair portrait of a society of women that are, in a sense, one dimensional; it would appear woman (or at least this one particular woman, Dinah) is prone to make life-altering decisions on the superficial characteristics of how a man looks. I am also greatly offended by the pagan spirituality that these ""women of the red tent"" supposedly protect, nurture and revere amongst a strictly monotheistic, Jewish society - hardly plausible but then again this is fiction.I will agree that Ms Diamant is an outstanding writer. I just wholly oppose calling this a 'christian' fiction as Ms Diamant has simply used a biblical text as her launch pad to a undermine and confuse a judeo-christian worldview."
1,Not What I Thought,While the book was well reviewed by others I was disturbed by the lack of veracity of actual Biblical history included in the novel. The continual representation of gods and goddesses was also disturbing. When I read the summary review for the book it seemed as if it was a fictional account of a real woman mentioned in the Bible. So as a Christian I looked forward to reading the book. But it was not at all what I thought it would be. It was all fiction and misrepresented the main character.
1,Too bad it's an AUDIO book,"The material of this book appears to be interesting, and the novel would probably be quite enjoyable. But the audio tape is greatly damaged by the breathless, over dramatic style of Ms. Bilger, the reader. Often emphasizing the wrong word or the wrong syllable, Ms. Bilger distorts the meaning of the text to the point where this listener could not even make it though the first tape!"
1,BORING,Many people have written about the inaccuracies of the bibilical nature of the book. I simply found the stories of these women BORING and PREDICTABLE. There is no depth or realness to any of the characters. Each sister represented a type of woman and each of them responded to every situation in exact way one might expect. BORING. I did not bother finishing.
3,"Interesting , but a slow read.","I'm a fan of historical fiction and found it fascinating to see how women of the biblical era MAY have lived. I think it's important for readers to understand that this book is purely fictional based on biblical characters (and not all of them were included in the Bible). I give this book three stars because much of it was somewhat depressing (chalk it up to the times in which they lived) and I would have liked to have known more of what the male characters (particularly Jacob) were thinking and feeling. I realize it was written from a female perspective. Still, it would have been nice to understand the males better. Also, the seemingly endless childbirths got old. I did struggle a bit to finish ""The Red Tent,"" but I'm glad Dinah found love and happiness at last."
5,What would you do if you were married to one of the first?,"I found Anita Diamant's answer to the question of the first generations of women married to the first few generations of Jewish men extremely interesting--they didn't drop their affiliations to the goddesses the first time their husbands suggested there was only one God. And what they did keep--and perhaps we've kept somewhere in our collective feminine conscienciousness--was shrouded in the Red Tent. I found her investigation of what might possibly have transpired between the lines of the Biblical stories a delight and an inspiration to someone who is also a writer (""Forever Retro Blues""). At any given moment it was difficult to put down. I shared Dinah's pain at the loss of her first love, the loss of her son. This was really a worthwhile read."
3,Childbirth 24 x 7 in the beginning...but I grew to like it,"I absolutely hated the beginning, feeling like it was childbirth and female degradation 24x7...but then I began to realize that there was far more to the story. And whereas I dreaded popping the cassette in (I read/listened during my morning commute), I forged on because of my commitment to my book club. I'm pleased to say that about 1/2 way into the book, I actually began to look forward to listening.I had a very hard time listening to the reader of this cassette, however. Her style seemed that of an announcer for a radio ad. To be specific, she sounded like the voice for ""Frugal Fannies"" -- a discount store in the New England area. It was a bit over done...plus, to my ear, she seemed to have a hint of a southern accent, which made it hard to picture her as Dinah.I'd recommend the printed version!"
5,"By far, one the best books I have ever read","This book was recommended to me via a friend in a book club. At first, I was hesitant due to the nature of the book and my non-religious background.However, I can tell you that this book is the only book that has ever moved me to tears. It's the kind of book that when you finish, you set the book down and think about it for days to come.I have passed this book on to friends and women in my family and all have come back with the same response... ""phenomeonal"". Don't let the subject matter haunt you, Red Tent is a story everyone can learn from."
4,Good and tragic,"""If you want to understand any woman you must first ask about her mother and then listen carefully.""Very interesting book about the lives and customs around 1402 BC in Hebron, where Jacob (the protagonist's father) and his progeny lived. The famous one in the Old Testament is Joseph and his coat of many colours, the gripping story is about Dinah, the only daughter.Sad, tragic, painful, but very well written and absorbing."
5,The Red Tent,"It was an excellent book. I really enjoyed it. It did follow the Bible somewhat but then it is fiction, based on some facts."
2,I'd require this book for women's studies. It's also a great read!,"Anita Diamant has written a story, of our history as women. This book has been on my shelf for several years. I'm somewhat protective of ""The Red Tent"". I feel like it is a scared part of my history as women. I love to read, and ""The Red Tent"" is definitely in my list of top 10 books. I'm disappointed that ""The DA Vinci Code"" is quickly made into a movie, when such a wonderful book as this is ignored. We need a ""Red Tent Society""."
5,This is my favorite book,"My mother recomended this book, and I can read it again and again with out getting bored. In most books I have to skip through the boring parts, but in this... I've read it three, four times and I've loved it each time."
2,Contradicts biblical story. Also base in places.,"Historical fiction usually fills in around known facts. If you know Genesis, you will note many contradictions to the scripture. This was very disappointing to me and detracted from the story. Paganism is glorified and the fathers of the Christian and Jewish faith are shown as people who don't even like their own faith. If you like wholesome books, parts are not."
2,Biblical Characters are Mis-represented,"I recognize that this is a work of fiction, but it would seem that the author should be true to the documented descriptions of her characters in the Bible. In an effort to tell an interesting story, the author has portrayed many of the characters to be people they never were. If one is going to write a ficitonal novel about this time in history, perhaps one should use fictional characters. Because I have read and studied Genesis, I found it difficult to reconcile the information that I knew to be truth with the story written by Diamant. As I read, I often thought ""This is a lie"". While the story was well written, I strongly disapprove of the author's inaccurate description of many of her real life characters."
4,too politically correct,"As several other reviewers mention, our congregational book club chose this book as its next subject. I found myself continually weeping at many descriptions, I also felt myself being manipulated by the author. I felt as if Diamant had an actual list of current women's issues (rape, abortion, marital abuse) which she needed to work into the plot. While she is a talented writer, the book might have seemed less contrived had I not begun to take note of and list these various contemporary women's issues to see how many of them she would eventually weave into the story. Yes, I learned a great deal about life in that time and I believe that the book was well researched. Nevertheless, be warned that you will notice every current PC topic in here and most of the men are w/o redeeming qualities. I still think it's worth reading and I'm glad I did."
1,MIsled by seller,"The seller advertised this book as new. I received a very used book.It even has an inscription on the front page to my aunt Jean Love Louise.I was buying this book as a gift. Which i cannot now do. If I wouldhave wanted a used book, many were available at less than Half of my""new"" one. I would like this charge taken off my credit card.Mary Ireland"
5,Audio Book,The audio was in perfect condition and arrived on time.I e-mailed the seller with a question and received an immediate responce.Very satisfied.
2,Here's the deal...,"I am sure this novel was surprising to some people who have never experienced any variation in their chosen dogma. To those of you who have, however, and especially those of you who have researched menstration rituals, The Red Tent may be a wee bit on the boring side. The character developement was good and I enjoyed the fact that Diamant chose Dinah (only mentioned once in the Bible) to concentrate on. I regard this novel as fluff reading, however. It is mediocre at best with so many other available stories to read (try Anais Nin, Julio Cortazar,for example). Sorry, but maybe a little research ... would lead you to a better buy."
2,Quite disappointed!,"After reading the first 7 reviews on this book, I ran right out to Borders and bought it. I thought I would settle in for a great read over Thanksgiving weekend. This book is a disappiontment! It is tedious and boring. The writing style is simplistic, written at a 4th grade reading level.Sure, Jacob married Leah and Rachel. After that, the author made up this wife, that wife, and the next wife; all with strange names. They all bore children with mostly strange names. Next, they each worshipped household gods with strange names. Half of this story is an alphabet soup of names. If I was interested enough, I could keep everyone straight, but I am not.In my opinion, the author took a Bible story, plugged in some basic facts, and ran wild making up the rest.Too bad she didn't make it interesting while she was at it!"
1,The Red Tent,"This novel, based on Biblical facts, was recommended by someone in my Bible study. An excellent depiction of the role women played in Bible history.Created an understanding of some of the mystical practices of that time."
4,hja,"I have just finished reading the Red Tent, it was it captivating. The story of Dinah truly makes you wonder. I found myself searching for more information on her. Diamant weaves a wonderful story of Bible history, fiction and ancient womanhood. This would be a lovely gift from Mothers to Daughters and Daughters to Mothers."
4,Great book Wonderful series,"This book is the wonderful conclusion to Joel Rosenburg's Keeper of the Hidden Ways trilogy. This book wraps up the story beautifully, and it is a constant page turner. Any fantasy reader will enjoy the combination of fantasy and modern within this series."
2,Sadly Disappointing...,"This is my second series by Rosenberg, and I fear it will be my last. The one thing all his books seem to have in common is an upward trend in Rosenberg's use of vulgar language... all of which is unnecessary, offensive, and highly distractive to this reader. And while his use of foul language has steadily increased, Rosenberg's storylines have just as steadily decreased. The plots have thinned dramatically. Very disappointing."
4,Above average old 'core,"Pretty good old straight edge hardcore from this West Coast band with Eric Ozenne of Nerve Agents and Redemption 87 on the mic. This is pre NA and Redemption, of course, and really good for what it is. Reminds one a lot of the same stuff going on in NY at the time, like Bold or Wide Awake, but a little less polished and macho sounding. Good stuff if you dig sorta generic old sXe hardcore. Fun to sing along and mosh to."
5,INSPIRATION,"when i first heard sarah!'s music, i was thrilled to hear ""real music"" again after being bombarded by riduculous pre-teen pop. sarah! is thoughtful and creative. i find her an inspiration for expressing one's own voice, both as a lyricist and a singer. i listen and listen and each time discover new nuances and depth. thank you sarah!"
4,a keeper,"This has some good high energy songs. If you really enjoy bands like Social Distortion, Rancid and/or Lars frederiksen and the bastards then I don't see how you can't like this. That's NOT to say that this album sounds exactly like those bands by any means but it contains the same style of that ""anthem"" sounding punk rock, some aggressive lyrics, and also Duane has that raspy voice which is what I like about it. The highlights are ""war with you"", ""hell mary"", ""blow my brains"", ""gunfight"", and ""the last cowboy"".also, ""marry me"" is mostly comical, in a good way. and has this country/bluegrass guitar line to it. 4 stars because there's some throw away tracks and, lets face it it's not like this album is brilliant, but it sure is fun."
1,Nothing new here!,"The problem with this video is simple, it doesn't tell you anything that isn't already widely known. Nonetheless, my hat is off to Harley Race and the others for grabbing some easy money from NBC for revealing absolutely nothing new!So hey, save your money and get a subscription to Dave Meltzer's 'The Wrestling Observer' and/or go out and support your local independent wrestling promotion in person!"
3,A mix of good and bad stuff,"This is definitely NOT the best book from dr. Ian Stevenson. The author has lost his skepticism and most of his scientific impartiality. The majority of cases included in this book lacks strong evidence sugestive of reincarnation, with the exception of a few very good cases. Because of these good cases, the book is still worth its value, but overall it is not a great work. ""Children who remember previous lives"" is a much better book from the same author."
4,Interesting but . . .,"This is an interesting book. Much of it dove-tails with what Rabbi Yonassan Gershom has written about those who died during the Holocaust and have been reborn as blond haired-blue eyed Gentiles. Except that Dr. Stevenson's cases seem to lose their memories of the events in their previous lives at about age 7 or 8 and Rabbi Gershom's cases seem to be forever haunted by their experiences. One other thing I found disturbing about Dr. Stevenson's work is that the majority of his cases are from India, Burma, and Thailand, where reincarnation has been acceptable many centuries longer than it has been acceptable in our Western culture. It makes it much easier to doubt his cases than if the majority of his cases were from a culture that was less accedpting of the theory."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Solid, however the hands are difficult to read. The price is reasonable and younger eyes may not have difficultly with the dial."
3,Mainly for western consumption,"Compared to Samsara by Wang Yong (Magic Stone 4715122000918) Sister Drum seems rather contrived, particularly dressing up as a Tibetan, which she is not, but also in pursuing the 'new age' market. Of course a comparison with Wang Yong is a bit unfair as he has the unbeatable street cred of being the occasional traditional instrument man in the backup band of China's king rocker Cui Jian (Balls under the red flag, Power of the powerless, etc.) yet when Wang Yong blends Buddhist and blues in a piece 'Himalaya Mountains' he does it with the same ease that other mainland rockers show in plundering China's musical traditions, it doesn't feel like a sophisticated marketing ploy. (One of the best tracks from Samsara, 'the Seance', can be found on the collection China Fire II, Zhongguohuo II, also from Magic Stone. Along with tracks from Dou Wei and Zhang Chu)."
2,I could not wait to buy this but then I was disappointed!,"I struggled to hear some of the more delicate sounds as (in my opinion) the whole album is too heavy on bass and much of the beauty lost somehow. I tried to listen with headphones but just could not get that haunting feeling. The song ""Sister Drum"" is good though and if they released this album again in a ""new & improved"" format, I would give it another go!"
3,Don't bother: primitive recording techniques,"Here's an album that wants for basic recording controls. The lady's voice is precious, the drums authoritative ... too bad they didn't have the ability to capture the dynamic range. Crank up the volume for the quiet parts, and get blown away when they bang the floor. Modern recording equipment keeps that from happening -- so why didn't they use it?"
1,the real mccoy?,"i spent a year studying in china alongside tibetan college students and travelling in and out of tibet itself. in the minds of many of my tibetan friends, this artist's music was not as tibetan as it could be. in fact, many said that it was more chinese than tibetan. my own opinion reflects thiers after i was given one of her tapes as i favor the local tibetan musicians/artists that are only found in china/tibet."
4,Great Music - I love this CD,"So why doesn't it get 5 stars? I only reserve 5 star ratings for the discs I absolutely can't live without. But that said, this is great. My kids love it (elementary school age). My wife loves is (she's Chinese from Taiwan). I love it (a regular white guy from the Western US).As other reviewers have mentioned, this isn't a CD of Tibettan music. It's a CD of music inspired by Tibet. There are traditional Chinese themes in it and the lyrics are in Mandarin. There are western-inspired new age/ambiant themes in it. And there are some more modern Chinese themes, that I hesitate to call ""pop"", but verge on that label.I've never been to Tibet, but have long been fascinated with that region of the world. I lived in East Asia for several years, and this music takes me back there.I can fully recommend this CD, but as others have mentioned, you definately need a nice sound system in an accoustically-appropriate room to fully enjoy this."
5,"excellent book on boston, the marathon and the experience o","A great book of Boston, the Marathon and the layman's experinces in running this race. Very easy to read, interesting history and antedotes along the way. You can tell the author did a lot of research for this book. I thorougly enjoyed 26 Miles To Boston and even mailed a book to my sister who lives in the South, so she too could have a little bit of the Boston Marathon experience herself!"
1,I liked the comments from the real Boston runners,"I bought this book while in Boston and was eager to read it as I was unable to remember much of the course. Marathons kill brain cell, I guess. In the early chapters the author tells how he didn't qualify, but intended to run anyway. I could not keep this detail out of my mind. Part of the ""Boston Experience"" is qualifying. The book gives lots of information of the towns and neighborhoods along the course which is great. Skip the author's acount of his run. It upset me, since I worked and sweat to qualify for Boston. The guy wrote a book that is easy to read, but he never qualified or experienced the real Boston. Skip this book unless you can't find anything else."
2,Go for the Sonny Chiba Action Pack !,"For much better video quality and Widescreen presentation, get Amazon's -Sonny Chiba Action Pack, which also contains the longer original version of Virus, in addition to 2 other Sonny Chiba movies, on 2 other separate DVDs.The longer version at 156 minutes is so much more complete, as compared to this shorter version, which is 108 minutes.The other reason for the better video quality on the Virus DVD of theSonny Chiba Action Pack: Virus/Golgo 13/Bullet Train, is because it is a dual-layer DVD, which can deliver better video quality with a longer run time."
1,Save your money :(,"These don't actually cut anything, including thread. The blades do seem sharp but I believe the flaw lies in the poor quality plastic handles. There's barely any spring action becasue all of it relies on the plastic ""loop"" idea at the back. And the blades can't pass tightly together enough to create the kind of friction to cut something as thin as thread or fabric because there's absolutely no pivot screw or anything :( I'm surprise at Fiskars as usually they make quality scissors. My advise is to save your money on this and put it towards a metal pear of thread snips. Nothing beats metal for cutting things :) Gingher makes a lovely pair and Gingher is now owned by Fiskars."
2,Instrumentals. Insipid.,"When I bought this, the option to listen to the songs wasn't working. It appears to be working now, but here's my warning anyway: for reasons known only to them, the marketers of this CD chose to not include the words to these songs. This is a CD of melody only--no words. The instrumental rendition is adequate, barely, but for songs like these, who cares? Without the words, Maresy Doats wouldn't even amuse the least promising of toddlers, much less improve their language skills or cetera.I give it two stars because I couldn't bring myself to listen to it twice, and thus may have missed some good point about it or another....but I doubt it. Let it go. I'm throwing mine away."
5,"An informative, entertaining review of effective management.","The authors present an interesting, thoroughly researched summary of effective management styles in practice. The interviews are personal and the individuals interviewed are not only successful, but fascinating.The authors' use of humor and gentle irony lends an amusing tone to the voice of this book, which is pretty rare in business tomes. I recommend Maximum Leadership to anyone in business school, or for ""light"" professional reading...it is easy to put down and pick up again. Even those of us who don't wear business suits can apply most of the principles to our interactions with associates and family.I did wonder, however, after absorbing the authors' summary of the five effective management styles...what other styles could there be? Management by cattle prod? by hypnosis? by bribery? I didn't waste too much time pondering this: given the credentials of the authors, I'm sure they would know.Makes a good professional gift, too."
3,an ok movie,"it has a pretty interesting..........plot if you watch the trailer or preview you will know what I mean, I don't want to give out spoiler so you just have to watch and see, it is also a pretty low budget movie, but it has a decent plot line and some creepy actor. Worth a rental at best."
2,A big disappointment,"In the late 70ies I saw the amazing version of ""Our Mutual Friend"" when it was shown on TV in the Soviet Union - and repeated later once more, in the early or mid 80ies. I was amazed how well the TV version matched my own impression of the book, which has been always my very favourite Dickens novel. The only thing that looked untruthful was that old Betty Higden had very good teeth, which was totally impossible at her age and at that time. But everything and everyone else were absolutely recognizable and amazingly truthful. Unfortunately - and totally unexplainably - that BBC version does not exist on video - as well as, by the way, ""The Forsyte Saga"". For anyone who is familiar with the older BBC movie their new attempt to create another ""Our Mutual Friend"" cannot be but a total disaster."
5,Absolutely Superb!,"This is a masterful rendition of Charles Dicken's last complete novel -- which I felt I just had to read after I saw the movie. The interconnection of the characters, the depth of the plots and subplots, the imagery, the acting, the satire, the mystery and suspense... everything is superb and intriguing. It's the kind of movie that the more you watch it, the more depth and detail you see. In general, I like ""dialogue"" movies, and my husband likes action. However, both of us consider this one of our favorites."
5,"This is a review of the video ""Our Mutual Friend""","This is definitely a video worth having in one's collection. I have already watched it four times and it just gets better each time I view it again. I can honestly say that this is the best film I have seen in a very long time. The acting was superb and Sandy Welch did an excellent job on the screenplay. The story is complex, for sure, but vastly entertaining. This richly woven masterpiece of drama, intrigue, mystery, humor, and romance will not fail to entrall viewers, regardless of age or background."
5,Excellent!,"An excellent adaptation of the story. I could have easily enjoyed an eight hour (rather than just six) version. Paul McGann was terrific (as always) as the bored Eugene Wrayburn in need of something--anything--to give his life meaning. The entire cast is excellent as are the costumes, settings, and script."
5,Rich and complex tale,"I ordered this dvd sight-unseen and was very pleased. My whole family (plus kids) watched it together. My kids (10 and 7) found it a bit hard to follow and wandered off after the first episode or two, but my husband and I watched it over several nights and loved it. If you don't know the story it might be a little hard to follow but no more than any of Dickens' usual complicated storylines with many characters that wander in and out of each other's lives. The film did a good job of including pretty much all of the story and characters and only simplified things a little. I loved all the performances, and my husband particularly enjoyed the storyline with Paul McGann and Keeley Hawes as would-be lovers from opposite ends of the social spectrum. If you're in the mood for a solid adaptation of a brilliant Dickens story of love, loss, greed, and social commentary, buy this one! For the bargain price, you can't beat this one for entertainment as well as the interesting dvd extras."
5,"A Fascinating Story, Fascinatingly Rendered","After having listened to the audiobook version of this book, I purchased the DVD from Amazon. It is very well done -- lots of drama, mystery, love, and even a touch of violence. The performers bring the characters to life, and the production brings the era to life. My spouse and I made sure we carved out an hour or two every evening until we got through the full six hours, and it was always difficult to tear ourselves away in order to go to bed. Very enjoyable -- leaves an impression on you for days afterward."
5,What in the Dickens'?,"Exactly! What in the Dickens' is not to like in the movie, ""Our Mutual Friend""? Charles Dickens' is a grand story teller and this DVD is grand as well. I was caught up from the beginning. Although, I have not read this Dickens' work, I suspected from his other stories, that I would be in for a treat. I was right! This film has great charactures, with an ending that I did not anticipate. If you have not read this Dickens' book then you will be surprised by the twist (pun intended) in this one. Another Dickens' piece to enjoy time after time."
4,Wonderful and dark but worth every second,"This is really the BBC at its finest. This is a long and complicated story so prepare to be a bit confused at the start because all the characters are introduced in the first hour and it can be difficult keeping them straight.Once the introductions are made you can settle in for a great story with the usual Dickens themes.Stellar performances throughout, particularly Keeley Hawes and David Morrissey.I've had the vhs for years and it's been borrowed to death. Now I can get the dvd."
5,You'll Want to Watch All 6 Hours in One Sitting . . .,"This is a complicated tale that is completely spellbinding and satisfying . . . as only a Dickens' tale could be. This film has it all; mystery, romance, history . . . and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoy the works of Charles Dickens, you will love this film!"
4,Our Mutual Friend - Streaming Version,"We taped the original when it premiered in 1998, and watched it until it wore out. We purchased the VHS when that came out, and the DVD when it was released. Loved them all - perhaps our favorite adaptation of all time.Unfortunately, the streaming version comes in at exactly 300 minutes - 39 minutes shorter than the original. Those missing 39 minutes include an entire subplot - the Boffins' attempt at adopting a child, that child's extended family, including Sloppy, and how Sloppy and the dollmaker meet, etc. - ALL missing. Several of the plot points no longer make sense without these scenes - how did Bella and Lizzie meet so that Lizzie would want Bella at her wedding?Who is the masked man that haunts Weg?I still rate it 4 stars - but would be five with all the scenes!"
3,Dicken's Our Mutual Friend,"I'm not really 'into' Dickens, as I find his material a wee bit too overly dramatic for my taste and the initial setups of the plot too unbelievable. Acting, directing etc is all fine, but the initial setup I have trouble believing, which seems a common problem in Dickens books, or those transfered to the screen IMO, though the troubled people of the times seem well portrayed and perhaps that was more the author's political intent? All of the recent productions of his work I've seen recently seem along to follow this pattern. Again a script issue most likely found in the book itself, so hard to 'fix' without a clever adaptation."
3,Objectionable Content Review,"***I realize not all people share the same views on what is acceptable or not. What I endeavor to do is merely state the facts of potentially objectionable situations found in this movie***Language: a few swear words, but not many at all.Flesh Flashes/Sexual Content: A male actor is seen walking naked into the river. He is shown from behind. Couples kiss. Women wear low-cut dresses.Violence: a man is beaten and thrown into the river. A dead body is shown, rather grizzly. Another man is beaten violently and is thrown into the river. You see his face and body heavily bloodied."
2,Disappointing,"I read the novel and adored it. I eagerly watched the adaptation, but I was disappointed to find that it lacked the spirit of the book. There is a lot of wasted time (the dialogue lags, and some scenes simply go on too long), and the performances are uninspired and lack urgency. The movie seems slack. This film is likeable, but all and all I would not recommend it."
3,Meh...,"Okay for what I paid for it (9.99). The acting was good, the sets were good - everything was well done. I just can't get all excited about this movie. I probably won't watch it again."
4,Another Dicken's Movie,I like the movie. I was pleasantly surprise by the different loves stories and wonderful ending.
5,OUR LIVES,"AGAIN THIS WAS A MOVIE THAT TOOK IN 3 SEPARATE LIVES, STEPHEN MACKINTOSH & ANNA FRIEL (AND OTHER WONDERFUL ACTORS) WERE GREAT, THE STORY WITH KEELEY HAWES & HER LOVER, AND THE SCHOOL TEACHER WITH HIS OBSESSION FOR KEELEY HAWES AND IT SHOWS HOW SEPARATE LIVES LIKE A SPIDER WEB HAVE A WAY OF WEAVING INTO ALL THESE LIVES, AND THE LOVE AND TRAGEDY THAT DEVELOPS.I LOVED DOMINIC THE COMPANION LAWYER OF EUGENE WHO LOVES KEELEY WAS VERY GOOD IN HIS QUIET AND LOVING WAY. WAS GREAT."
5,Our Mutual Friend,"Our Mutual friend is a very entertaining ""chick flick"" with lots of twists and turns and suspense with a great ending. The story is well acted with likeable characters and villains you just hate which makes the ending so much the better."
2,Found the production bland. The 1970 version far superior.,"Just like Hollywood, the newer version is not as good as the original video. I concur with the viewer from Port Washington in every way. I've tried to get the original Masterpiece Theater Production, even writing to Thames Production in London without results. Costume dramas do not become dated. Bring back the best!"
4,Stick with it....It's worth it.,"Typical of Charles Dickens tales, this story does not shy away from showing us the seedier side of life. But, that's what makes the good guys so compelling; the contrast to the low-lifes around them. In this case both the low-lifes and the heroes come from all ranks of society, from ""dust men"" and river people to the social elite. The contrasting conditions of these different classes is the real crime.Unfortunately, with the pace rather slow and the story line so dark, it may be difficult to get into this movie. I almost turned it off after about half an hour. But, I'm glad I stuck with it. As the characters developed, I was drawn into the story more and more. It ends well also which for me is the real pay off. Charles Dickens is still a little dark for my taste, but, I found this piece very much worth the time to watch it. And, if you are a real C.D. fan, you will want to add this DVD to your collection."
4,Dark Tales of Charles...,"There are some tales of Charles Dickens I really like and others I do not. This one is the four-star moment, portrayed fairly well in this DVD series. I must say that BBC does a great job of putting together those despicable characters on the poor side of town that give you the shivers. This one is certainly no different! If you're looking for another good period series, add it to your collection."
5,Good DVD Release of a Great Dickens Adaptation,"Others here have done a fine job of reviewing this excellent film, so I'll focus briefly on the DVD from BBC/Warner. The video and audio transfers of Our Mutual Friend are quite good. Although there are no subtitles, this DVD is closed-captioned. In general, this DVD is of similar quality to other BBC Dickens adaptations that have been released on DVD (e.g., Oliver Twist (1999) and David Copperfield (1999)).One reviewer below complained that 45 minutes or more of the original film are missing from this DVD. I have no idea where he got that idea. It must be some kind of misunderstanding or perhaps a defective copy because my copy clearly has the entire film (divided into four episodes, two on each side of a two-sided disc). The all-important climax and ending scenes of this 351-minute production are all there to enjoy. Highly recommended for Dickens fans and fans of period dramas in general."
5,Captures the spirit of the book visually & emotionally,"Sumptuously cast and sumptuously shot, this series, along with Martin Chuzzlewit, provides aninsight into what the BBC can do when it's given a chance.All the performances are masterful and the emotional journeys of the characters are beautifully presented.Excisions are inevitable - Fascination Fledgeby is no more - and a tiny bit of the subtext relating to him is missing but the background of the river, the muck and the money, all tumbled together, make a wonderful setting for the florid behaviour of these Victorian arrivistes."
5,Another great BBC Adaptation,I have nothing to say but good things about this version. I loved the story and the acting brings the darkness of humanity and society to the forefront. Anyone who is afraid of picking up this hefty novel definitely should consider this mini-series. Love the costumes. Love the acting.
5,Great Dickens,"I absolutely loved this story, the characters and everything about it. It is a bit slow to start but once it's does, you won't get enough. If you like BBC and Dickens then this is a must see."
4,Another great production from BBC,Enjoyed this Charles Dickens adaptation. A very talented cast that kept the story moving along seamlessly. Never a dull moment. Recommend it to fans of Victorian Literature.
5,Beautiful and Exciting Dance Music,Amazing how this music shows such clear affinitys to Klezmer and Gypsy muisc.love this album; it is beautiful and exciting dance music.
4,A Lesson Can Be Learned By The Young And Old,"This was a great story of how are ancestors and older generation can teach us if we just listen to their stories. The older population can teach the younger generation how to cook,love and live if we would just listen. Grandma Ollie was trying to teach her granddaughter how to love by using things that happened in her life. The special treat in this story was Grandma Ollie and her gift. This gift was also passed on to her granddaughter Terri who thought it was just a little feeling in her gut. This book starts off with Grandma Ollie getting a bad sign about Terri's fiance. Terri finally is able to read the sign and then all hell breaks loose. All Terri really wants is a chance at Love. She is like the hip new young generation where Terri is doing very well in her career but the clock is ticking for family life. Read this cute little story about the young and the old."
5,The Plot Against Humanity,"Elizabeth Dilling Is little remebered today. However, she was once a widely read authority on subversive activities, particularly Jewish ones.""The Plot Against Christianity"" contains a wealth of material, thoroughly documented, on these activities. No one has ever refuted her research; she is merely denounced by the other side. Read the meticulous research for yourself and you will quickly discover who is really lying."
1,Antisemitic and racist material,"According to Wikipedia, the Noontide Press is an American publishing entity which publishes, among other racist and antisemitic titles, the ""Protocols of Zion"", as well as the ""International Jew"", 2 well-known ""classics"" of racism. Noontide Press is the publishing arm of the ""Institute for Historical Review,"" which is the premiere group of Holocaust deniers.You believe what is written in any book published by this company at the peril of your intellectual integrity. This is hate material masquerading as literature, and full of lies. I urge people to remember that just because it is in print does not make it true!"
4,Funk essential,"I am a fan of the Meters' early albums for the Josie label, which consisted of the funkiest 3-minute toss-off instrumentals ever. To me, the closer they got to doing the Neville Bros./New Orleans ""sound,"" the cheesier and less appealing they got. Fortunately, this reissue of their 1974 Warner album shows them stretching out their songs, but still packing a punch. The Porter/Nocentelli/Modeliste rhythm section is as hot as ever, and all of the tracks, from the outrageously funky party tunes to the smooth and soulful groovers, will not disappoint. There is even a 12-minute song, ""Aint No Use,"" which is an R&B-type song that turns into a funky jam."
5,CLASSIC METERS for sure!,"According to some, the Meters' earlier instrumental stuff is the one and only ""classic Meters"". I wholeheartedly disagree. This album is about as classic as it gets! It's just very different from their earlier style, so different in fact that you can hardly compare them.This is a much more mature and sophisticated work, and without dissing the instrumentals in any way - I love them too! - I must say that this is my favorite Meters album. In fact it's my favorite album of all time!If you are unfamiliar with the funky, funky Meters (possibly the funkiest band of all time? Just listen to the awesome Modeliste/Porter rhythm section!) - this is the place to start. An All-Time Classic from start to finish!"
5,"Spicy N'Awleens Seasoned Funk, Bayou Rock...","...say! Ain't that Nightbird Nona Hendrix on the cover?Are you gonna love this. One of the Phonkayist recordings ever made....done in the 70s. If you ain't blown away by ""Ain't No Use"" and its extended funk workout, well, mebbe there's a history of rigor mortis in your family.Plus, to all Ol Skoolers looking for something other than the Usual Suspects of Funk Bands, try it out."
5,OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY ! ! ! ! !,"Champian is one of the best female Jazz Voacalists/Pianists around today. I am lucky enough to see her regularly here in NYC, usually with her trio, which is a MUST SEE. This CD is Champan Fulton with David Burger and the Sultans of Swing Big Band. One of the best Big Bands around today. They regularly play on Tuesday nights at Birdland here in NYC. . This CD has it all. Great Jazz vocalist and a GREAT Big Band backing her up. The material is superb. Listen to the samples here. If this is the style of Jazz that you like, then this is as GOOD as it GETS ! ! ! ! !"
3,"Harbor Freight Quality,","I bought these because I own a pair of channel locks made in the 70s,sad to say like most made in USA Items sold today the quality is no where near what it once was, I will stick with European and Chinese made tools, American companies need to realize we don't mind paying for quality,if I want cheap made crap I can buy it for a lot less than I paid for these,days are gone that I will pay a premium for the USA Stamp"
1,This Is A Fraud!,"The title is misleading. Less than 1/3 of this 'film' is about Bruce Lee, which features films made when he was a child actor, and a paltry amount of other photos. Then the shmucks who created this 'film' completely forget the 'real' Bruce Lee and show a wanna-be named Bruce Li whose martial arts are marginal at best. After that debacle, we get to watch a poorly made Kung Fu movie featuring another wanna-be named 'Dragon Lee', who, whilst he may physically resemble the real Bruce, is much slower, and his style of Kung Fu rather ornate and silly which the real Bruce thought was a waste. What's really a waste is any money spent on this fraud of a film. The hucksters who threw it together did so withthe obvious intent of duping the public looking for a quality documentary on the one and only late Bruce Lee. It's an insult to his legacy. The shysters who spliced this crap together should be flogged in public. Whatever you do, don't buy this film!"
2,This movie is great,"It is like 2 hours long and it is freaking awesome.The first 90 minutes show Bruce Lee childhood movie clips and while all that is interesting, it gets really good when they start showing the Bruce Li clips. The we get like a full length Dragon Lee movie. I have to say that this has to be the best Dragon Lee movie I have ever seen. He actually does more than 1 kick in succession, cartwheels, and of course he is the closest looking Bruce Lee imitator(at least in facial expressions). His super kick has to be checked out for the special effects alone. If Dragon Lee wasn't a Bruce clone he may have actually been able to make it in the kung fu movie industry.I wouldn't really consider this a movie, but it does turn into a Dragon Lee movie that was almost watchable."
1,Don't fall for this cheap trick!,"i bought this dvd because it is presented as a documentary of Bruce Lee, but beware....it is not! first you get 20 minutes with poor quality (i've seen better of these scenes) black & white scenes of the old chinese bruce lee films. After that in about 2 minutes his lifestory is told (with only pictures). And then you get a complete movie with a imitator called Dragon Lee. Altough he is a pretty good fighter and does a good imitation. This is not what i expected. The movie is very very bad. And it is not Bruce Lee !!! If you're looking for a good DVD documentary of bruce lee, skip this one....it's a fake.!!!!"
1,Another duped fan,"Thought this would be a documentary on Bruce Lee's movies. Instead it is only some footage of his early childhood and rest is the 2 imitator Bruce Lee. DO NOT buy this DVD, not worth spending even a dollar on."
3,Bruce lee duplicate is good but not good enough!,"Hey,I watched this film, it does have some good fight scenes of a Bruce Lee duplicate, but who is nothing compared to the actual legendary Bruce Lee. In the beginning, it contains like a 30 minute documentary on the Real Bruce Lee and his life, showing clips from his early childhood movies made in Hong Kong, before he came to the US. I think you can watch this film once for the sake of Bruce Lee, if you are his fan and the fight scenes are not bad, they are watchable!But don't get your hopes too high and you probably will not be watching it often and you can make your own judgement about the duplicate Bruce Lee and his fighting from this film."
1,BRUCE LEE THE LEGEND - Baaaaaad,"This was a horrible movie. Thats all I have to say. First, it tells you about Lee, then it shows you four of his Chinese movies he did as a kid. Then, the rest of the movie is about some Bruce Lee imitator and is unrelated to Bruce. Extremely cheap, avoid this thing!"
1,This Film Is A LIE!!!!,"The title is misleading, the dvd cover synopsis is misleading, there is no rare footage of the REAL Bruce Lee to be found in the pic...only footage of the clones doing a poor job of exploiting the Little Dragon. A sad reminder of how Bruce's name and legacy was exploited by cold-hearted hustlers. GARBAGE!"
5,Buyer Beware,"I love this cd. Carol Kaye is perhaps the best bassist of her time. One problem though, if you buy it - she won't see one cent from the sale. I suggest you go to her web-site and buy it directly from her. It's cheaper and it's only fair."
3,Just OK,"Nice music, but not as good as some of their later work. I listen to this at work and it fills the need, but I have a hard time telling anyone to run out and buy it."
4,Ambiance and so much more,"I met Greg Carmichael and Nick Webb at a show in Ranch Cordova California some years ago. I was saddened by the death of Nick Webb as I felt he was a truely visionary guitarist. I have travelled around the country ever since to see them play. As a musician and guitarist, I was attracred to the unique fore front of guitar arrangements on their earlier albums and evolved with them into a true affecianado of their mature and eloquent sound. I reccommend not only this retrospective, but any of their other albums for the musician and non musician alike who will surely enjoy their soaring rythmns and artistic arrangements and production. There is nothing quite like a late night, a bottle of wine and making love while the poetic music of Acoustic Alchemy accentuates every beat of your lovers heart."
1,"The most BORING ""Best Of..."" I've ever heard.","I only own 2 AA releases...""Natural Elements"" & ""The New Edge"", so I thought by buying this I could catch up to speed with this very talented duo. Nope. This is absolutely, gut wrenchingly, boring. Music for people who don't like music. Nothing is memorable...it is bland as a mash potato sandwich on white bread. The most disappointing ""Best Of"" collection I've ever heard."
5,Nice accoustic sound,"This is my first album by Accoustic Alchemy, most of the tracks are first class hence I want to buy more of their staff,five stars ratting from me"
3,It does the job,"I was somewhat disappointed in this product....the rounded edge is too large to wrap a blouse's collar around, it is somewhat unsteady and I do not like the metal iron rest as it is flimsy and I am unable to dismount it and get it out of my way. However, for a quick fix it does the job,"
3,NICE BOARD,GREAT FOR SMALL APARTMENTS A LITTLE UNSTABLE BUT OK REALLY MADE FOR A SINGLE PERSON OR FOR A SECOND HOME NOT A PRIMARY IRONBOARD
3,"Good, (for now).",The Polder Deluxe Tabletop is about what I expected. It provides the basic needs of a tabletop ironing board but it is no substitute for a full size ironing board. The metal skids are a little unstable and don't work well on a wood table. It's best if you put down a table cloth or a towel to prevent the ironing board from moving.
5,Table top ironing board,Study and not wobbly. Great for what I needed it for- quick ironing and touch ups. I need nothing more.
3,OK for occasional use,"I iron maybe three times a year, so i didn't need anything fancy or that would take up lots of room. This ironing board is basically what you'd expect--small, lightweight, easily stored, cheaply made. It is not especially sturdy, but for an occasional ironer it'll get the job done. I will say, i was pleasantly surprised to find that the pull out iron holder is actually strong enough to hold the iron."
3,Not too bad for the price,"When it came one of the welds were busted already. Instead of trying to send it back and go through the hassle I put some gorilla glue on it clamped it overnight. It has been holding ever since. Other than that, it's not a bad ironing board. I just needed something for my wife to iron my dress shirts for work that didn't take up a lot of room. It does the job for a budget board."
5,Great Ironing Board,This ironing board was exactly what I was looking for in my house. I needed one that I could store underneath the bed conveniently and would not take up a lot of space. The legs are easy to operate and lock into place everytime. Once on top of the bed the height is perfect to start ironing. This is definitely a great product to have if you don't have room for a conventional board.
3,Fine - but there are better options. UPDATED,"UPDATE: Apparently, since I purchased this, Amazon is now offering this under their FREE SHIPPING program. However, there is still the issue of the cover.Bought this because it was promoted when I bought my new iron, and reviews said it'd be perfect for my limited condo space. It is nice and small - though a bit too small for my tastes. For $10.00, I don't regret the purchase (though there was an over $8 shipping charge added on to that - they don't really alert to you - since it didn't come directly from Amazon.)FYI, it doesn't really have a cover on it - unless you count the cotton covered board it's built with. Although this works just fine, would recommend going to TARGET - where I've since learned I could buy pretty much the same board - without waiting for it to be shipped, for the 10 bucks --- but with my choice of a designer cover."
5,handy & Inexpensive,"I really hate to iron. Part of my problem was dragging out a giant ironing board and blocking some pathway around the house. This little board was a nice compromise for me. It is cheap, works well for most small jobs, and stores compactly."
3,Inconvenient,"I bought this after reading the +ve reviews on amazon, but this turned out to be a disappointment.- inconvenient for your back- your clothes will be lying on the floor while you are ironing; they will get dirty (height of this item is less than a foot)"
3,You pay for what you get,"I found this ironing board that was pretty inexpensive (especially w/ free shipping) considering it's feature of an iron holder. However the cover on the board is really thin, and the smell is pretty pungent (smells like potato sacks). Overall the board is easy to open, but the iron holder is a little weak. Like I said, you get what you paid for."
1,Not useful for me,"I only use an ironing board a few times a month so it seemed silly to get a full sized one. This one, however, isn't useful to me. When I iron I like to ""press"" down with at least a little weight/pressure and this board always overly flexes when I do this. I've reverted to using a towel/whatever on top of my tiled floor when I iron :-("
1,Do not buy this,"I bought this on amazon along with a Panasonic Iron.When I received it, it was well packaged and looked new. But when I used it,the board had a horrible smell, which stuck to anything I ironed over.Probably the inside foam is filled with garbage. I have now discarded the boardand purchased a new one."
4,pressing matter,"I have not used the item yet, but it arrived very quickly and seems exactly as pictured.Plus it is less than half the price I've seen for exactly the same thing in catalogs.Thank you very much."
2,Very roughly made,"Cheap ""Made in China"" product, very roughly made. Though 10$ price is cheap, I swear in China 10$ can buy five of this thing!"
5,Adult son gift,I cannot believe how fast my 2 items ordered arrived. This is just as I wanted for my son- easy storage- great for his condo! Looks sturdy!
4,"Small, extremely portable.","Living in a college dorm, there is not a lot of space to put things, especially when you have roommates. With meetings to go to and having to iron out my clothes, this thing really helps. It fits neatly under my bed and it does not take up a lot of space."
4,Small Space,This is perfect for someone who has a small apt and limited storage space. It easily fits standing upright in my closet.
3,It's okay,"It seems okay and sturdy enough, but the lack of cover is annoying. I blame myself for not paying better attention to the product description and pictures."
4,Decent for what it is,It's pretty sturdy and quite useful given it's size. Still not a match for the full-size lone standing ones though.
2,It is smelly and I don't know how to clean it,"This board arrived at my home for a few days, I still cannot use it because of its smell. I want to clean it before I iron anything on it, but it seems the cover cannot be removed. So I leave it in a room and is now waiting for the smell to go itself..."
4,Does the job and fits in tight spots,"this one, does the job and fits in pretty tight spots. all you need is a wall you can prop it up against and you are done. just one note, it comes with its default cover, it does not come with any extra slip covers (where as I got an impression when I bought it that it would come with a nice slip cover)."
3,Cover,Works as a table top ironing board but I'm disappointed with the cover...cheap fabric that is stapled to the board. Makes replacement a challenge. Description on cover said that replacement cover is available but I haven't been able to find anywhere.
1,Get what you pay for....,The extendable iron holder is fairly cheap and you risk flipping the board due to the weight of the iron. And the fabric covering is way cheap and has an awful chemical smell that transfers to clothes.
5,Great!!!,Wonderful little ironing board. Very sturdy with a nice slide out stand for the iron to rest on. Well worth the money.
2,Board warps,I bought this board from polder because I had one for years without an issue; the board was perfect for small spaces. This board however warps at both ends once the board heats up while ironing making it more difficult to iron. I should have returned it but didn't because it was inexpensive. Now I have to buy something else.
2,board warps,"lightweight and the board warps at the ends; very flimsy. The pad is great, needs a thicker board for stability."
3,"Light weight, right size, but warpy board","Pros:1. Room saving size2. price is right3. light weightCons:1. The board will warp when heat is applied for a while.2. A cheap product, should use heavier frames.Recommended if you don't mind the warping board."
1,Shipped Damaged Item,"We received the box containing the ironing board - the box was pristine on the outside and inside. However, I can't say the same for the item. The two legs were severely bent - one to such a degree that it cannot be straightened without breaking it. This item was damaged before it was placed in the box AND THAT IS OBVIOUS TO ANYONE who is not blind, drunk, or completely drugged out of it. What a rip off! The only thing deluxe about this was the cardboard box it came in."
1,Boring and predictable romance,"The title sounds great but the writing doesn't only leave much to be desired, it leaves everything to be desired! It is predictable and trite. I was hoping for a writer of the talent equal to Barbara Michaels. This author is a huge disappointment. I will never purchase another of her books. She writes as if she's imagining herself in the part of her female character. She writes as a lovestruck teenager writes in her journal."
4,Great Snow Shovel,"I bought this shovel to replace two snow shovels that I have been using for the past couple years. This is a fantastic replacement. It is a little heavier than the standard snow shovel, but can carry two to three times the load and scrapes the sidewalk clean. The only reason I marked it down to a 4 is because I noticed a little rust on it already. So if you buy this shovel make sure you keep it inside a garage or shed after you are done using it."
1,Freedom of Speech,"This is a great book for people with very strict views on religion, otherwise I believe it is just trying to silence rock. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, but please, don't force what you believe onto others. If you don't like rock, change the channel!!!!!"
3,An average thriller,"This is not Follett's best work, or even close to it. The characters were superficial and the writing was clunky."
2,Mildly Boring,"OK, the author is generally so good that you are ready to forgive him for this one and move to the next better one.I found the book lacking in inspiration and missing the epic dimension one can find in Pillars of the Earth. Too bad."
2,I like Ken Follett,"I am hooked on Ken Follett writing style but, this book was a bummer. The plot is totally contrived, hardly believable (except, of course, the PanAm scene/technology). When you are at 3/4, you know how it MUST end."
4,Pan Am review,"I had never heard of the Pan Am Clipper, but now I know lots thanks to this book and Googling. This story kept you in suspense and is so different of a plot from the other books I have read by Ken Follet. I loved this book. Now I'm reading the book The Key to Rebecca by Ken Follet and find it just as interesting and learning about how WW2 affected Cairo. Such talent Ken Follet is as an author!"
2,"thin, compared to his great ones","Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Night over water is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."
1,Spoiler Alert,"The books was completely spoiled for me because 3/4 in the story there is a very sudden and extremely inappropriate scene. I can accept adult scenes, but this was unexpected because up until this point, there was no other adult material that would have at least warned the reader. I was abruptly ambushed with something I would never choose to read."
4,Welcome Aboard the Pan Am Clipper,"I read this 544 page paperback in 3 days. Its ""Ship of Fools"" meets the Pan Am Clipper in 1939 at the very beginning of WWII. Everybody on the legendary flying boat seems to be running away from something and their stories all intersect during the 40 hour flight from England to the U.S. Its an easy and fun read, and the closest we'll ever get to experiencing the golden age of travel by flying boat."
3,Didn't Take Flight For Me.,"Follett does his usual excellent job of researching his subject matter--in this case old passenger seaplanes--and the history of the era (a world spinning toward war in the late 1930s). And the writing style is fine, but the story just never got off the ground. I never quite got the point. It was as if he worked hard to invent characters and plot around a subject he wanted to write about: seaplanes. The whole thing seemed like a stretch. Think of it as ""Airport 1938.""To Follett's credit he wrote in Night Over Water perhaps the steamiest sex scene I've ever read. I almost tried waking up the wife (dangerous). Plus I read this book after being completely blown away by his Pillars Of The Earth, so a let-down was inevitable. The book is better than most and probably deserves four stars. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead"
4,"Suspense, romance and intrigue","Night Over Water harkens back to the end of the golden age of flight, concluded with the silencing of the PanAm Clipper. On the eve of World War II, the story follows a diverse collection of passengers who fly this luxury craft's final revenue flight from England to America. On the single night they spend over the Atlantic, their lives become intertwined in ways none of them imagined. The story of passengers escaping to a new world, running from an old, or eluding the present one is tangled with deceit; mystery; suspense; and love lost, found, and rediscovered. Night Over Water is a gripping story that is worth the price of admission."
4,Highly Recommended!,"""Night Over Water"" was a highly enjoyable read. Eventhough the book starts out slow and uneventful, Ken Follett does an exceptional job developing the characters. I rated this book a 4 (which should be 4 1/2) because for the first half of the book I found it hard to concentrate and stay entertained. Follett jumps from one character to another explaining their life history and how they have ended up on the plane. Once the plane takes off, the story really begins to soar. Much to my surprise, the author also incorporates a series of romantic adventures. This was the first Ken Follett book I've read and it will definitely not be the last!"
4,Good.,"Not as great as some of his other novels, but entertaining. Slightly predictable and loose plot.An easy read. Not typical Follett."
3,"Reasonably Follett, not great, just entertaining.","I enjoyed the light tension of the many story lines that Follett has again imbedded into this book. Not only is this book's story entertaining, but also somewhat educational, as usual. I was somewhat dismayed by a mistake in the last two pages: there is no large City of St.John north of the Bay of Fundy, but rather a City of Saint-John (the people of Saint-John would tell you and so would the post office)! This book was a reasonably good one to read after ""Pillars..."",""...Freedom"",...Needle"" and ""...Fortune"""
3,Watered Down,"This book, like all of Follett's books kept me reading until the end but compared to his other novels it..didn't. The story had all the components that make a Follett novel great but that may have been the problem, it did seem like Follett was trying to force out another book as per contractual obligations. Good but not great."
2,Don't waste your money,"What a crappy book. I read this after just finishing ""Pillars of the Earth."" I thought that was such a great book that I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into ""Night Over Water."" I wish I was wearing dentures so I could take them out and wash them. This book was a huge disappointment. Once I start a book I will finish it, but it was a chore finishing this. The characters are one dimensional. There are no surprises. The story would have been better off remaining in Mr. Follett's mind. It says nothing and goes nowhere I was interested in going. I'm amazed that a man capable of other great works could try to foist this off on the reading public. Guess he needed a few bucks. Read ""Pillars of the Earth"" again, instead."
4,"My first Follett book, not bad","I thought this story was interesting enough to keep you reading and I found the concept of a flying overnight boat to be interesting. I love books that take place during world war 2 so I liked the setting as well. The characters, to me, acted fine, they were much better drawn than people in some of the other books I read and they acted understandably. Diana got jealous, and sulky, Margeret had surprising dimensions as you read through the book ( at the beginning she seems like a good little crusader), I liked Harry's character, I thought he was really amusing. I didn't think Nancy was that interesting but she gave the book flavor, and I liked Mervyn more than I liked Diana's other lover. The political situations and beliefs added spice to the story, as well as the conflicts."
4,"A romantic, humorously intriquing novel.","I've enjoyed reading other Ken Follett's novels -- recently ""The Pillars Of The Earth"" -- and found ""Night Over Water"" a change from his more serious novels. It ""trips lightly"" making fun at it's characters. Simply enjoyable reading.I would recommend this for someone who could appreciate a light humorous novel."
2,Follett fantasy,"Not one of his best. Fanciful plot that doesn't hold up, weak characters, cardboard figures, improbable actions. Save your money, it's not worth it."
4,Another Follett,"I enjoy Follett's writing style of building separate story lines in their own chapters and eventually tying them together. Reading some of these earlier books while awaiting ""Winter of the World"", the sex seems a bit repetitive but that does not interfere with the story lines and character development."
3,Should Have Been Written As NonFiction,"The author, Ken Follett, obviously researched ""clippers"", the passenger seaplanes that crossed the Atlantic just before the outbreak of World War II, very well. He also did a very good job of providing detailed and interesting information about them to his readers. However, a strained story line into which many misplaced sex scenes are injected just to keep the book going, along with very shallow and undeveloped characters greatly undermine the value of this book. As a nonfiction, it would have rated five stars, but as fiction, even three stars is a stretch."
4,To know the first transatlantic flight,"This book tells you or let you know how were the firsts trips to Europe by plane so you can compare them with our days, the book is really easy to read and have some internal good jokes, maybe I will keep away 2 or 3 sex scenes but in general is a good book."
3,Drawn out start that finishes stong,"I'm a big Ken Follet fan. He's one of the best suspense writers of our time. That being said, it took a while for the story to get going. Nearly the first half of the book is spent in character development. One of Follet's strong points is his character development. Unfortunately it took too long, well past the ""100 page rule"". I'm glad I didn't abort the read, as the story really picked up pace after that. There were some ""yeah, right"" moments, but then again it's fiction! Follet shined in the latter half of the book."
4,Decent story by Follett,"I don't know if I enjoyed the whole story beginning to end. Meeting the characters in the beginning took too long, the plan ride over was a little boring, and the action wasn't enough. It didn't keep my attention sometimes."
2,Slow paced,"Maybe this is just Follett's style, but there was tremendous character development, but it was just too slow paced for my taste. I only made it 60% through the book before I just became too bored to read what happens next. The action takes place on a plane, and the characters don't even get ON the plane until around p. 120, so I give the book 2-stars. I personally wasn't engrossed in the story, but I appreciate there is an audience for richly detailed, advertised suspense stories, even if they aren't exciting reads to this reviewer."
3,"A pale, period melodrama","Ken Follett is one of those uneven writers who is just as likely to publish a great book as a mediocre one. Unfortunately, this is a mediocre one. In fact, it reminded me a great deal of those early WWII 'B' movies that studios used to turn out every couple of weeks, where the characters and the plot were pretty predictable and the outcome mostly certain. This book has some points of interest, mostly historical detail. Follett obviously has some kind of keen interest in the big flying boats of the period, but he doesn't use that fascination to advance the story well. The characters are stereotypes and the action is melodrama. The reader doesn't come away from this book with much to remember fondly."
2,I thought it would have been better,"The only other Follett book I've read was PILLARS, which i consider one of my favorite books ever, this one however doesn't even make the top 500. Here's why?1)it read like a bad soap opera than a good thriller, people fall out of love then run into someone else and fall in love with them and so on.2)I couldn't care less about the characters, the only one who was interesting was the thief, then that got ruined by this lovey/dovey soap opera junk too.3) then ending was so ridiculous that I actually laughed out loud. I found myself saying ""Ya right"" way too often and that is never good.I did,though, finished it and at times some of the multiple stories do grab you but overall it's trash and I'll know one day I'll see a movie version of it on the lifetime channel."
3,The shame begins...,"When I first heard this album, I didn't know if crying or laughing was in place. Like Desmond Child screwed up Alice Cooper, so has Mutt Lange done with Bryan. Lange just couldn't leave it alone, he had to go and turn what was once ""The Bryan Adams Band"" into ""The Def Leppard Band"". -But worst of all; he made Bryan sing like Joe Elliott. Sorry, but this is where I (a fan since '83), and all other serious Adams-fans, quit. The 3 stars are solely for the brilliant guitar-work on this album, nothing else."
5,Bryan Adams' Last Great Album Until ROOM SERVICE,"WAKING UP THE NEIGHBOURS is the last great album that Bryan Adams did until ROOM SERVICE. It sounds a lot like Def Leppard (he used that band's producer, ""Mutt"" Lange, for this one), but somewhat earthier. This album contains plenty of great rockers, but also increases his ballad quotient. His next couple of albums would turn him into a fairly faceless adult contemporary artist, but here he was still good for some great field-day-ready rockers."
1,Because there is no 0 star option,"This album is downright bad. Songs and lyrics range from stupid to horrendeous. I like 80's music and but this is just too much. Its beyond cheesy, dry, overproduced and entirely laughable - think a mutant cross of van-halen, def leppard and shania twain. Nothing works here at all from the dull rock attempts to the tired ballads.This is one of the worst examples of corporate rock I've heard by a famous artist."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"I grew up listening to this cd nonstop. I bought at least five tapes because they'd keep on breaking. I recently pulled the cd out of my collection while ripping some files onto my MP3 player. I still remember all the words to the songs but the cd is a bit cheesey to me now. Its funny how everyone I know hates Bryan Adams but I love him. His early stuff was better. Still though, a great rock album."
5,Surprisingly very Rock,"This album is probably most well know for it's ballads and with good reason. ""(Everything I Do) I Do it for You"" and ""Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven"" are arguably the best ballads Bryan Adams has ever done. Personally, though, I love this album for the rock, every bit as good as the ""Summer of '69"" days. I won't list everything, but the best are surely ""Is Your Momma Gonna Miss Ya?"", ""Not Guilty"", ""There Will Never Be Another Tonight"", and ""Touch the Hand"". Those that were put off by the ballads, don't worry, this album is still a great rock and roll record."
5,great work bag,"fits my computer and everything I need for commuting. you do need to play with the strap to get it just right for yourself, but once that's done, it's a breeze. smart design in terms of compartments. I do wish there was a bit less velcro - it is impossible to open up the bag without making noise. still, I give the bag 5 stars for overall appeal and usability."
2,Not helpful for college level biochemistry,"I was hoping for a supplemental to my undergrad biochem course. This book breezes over topics a little too quickly. I thought the enzyme kinetics chapter could have been more detailed. I wouldn't recommend this for college students, might be good for people generally interested in biochemistry without any of the details."
2,Brief overview,"Very concise and great for a brief overview, but not much detail for important topics."
4,Almost City of Quartz,"The History of Forgetting is among the best of the newly bourgeoning genre of LA urban history and theory. Much of the information within is presented in an engaging, if leftist style. This book fits well alongside Mike Davis' landmark City of Quartz, though it's rather self indulgent chapter of fiction (written from the point of view of a Vietnamese immigrant), is tiresome and ultimately incongruous with Klein's apparent desire to expose the rewriting of LA's various histories. A strong, if flawed book."
3,No miracles!,"I have used this product in the past. There is NOTHING that can be done for sun damage (what I have on my neck). I mean, who knew back in the days of baby oil, iodine, and reflectors? NOTHING can get rid of it- not even laser. And I believe the same is true of rosacea. Believe me, I have asked my dermatologist repeatedly hoping they have found something. BUT I have found that this product tones it down more than the others I have tried. That's an improvement, not a miracle."
3,Lyrics only of Carmina Burana,"The Carmina Burana piece is chorus only, no dancers. Carmina Burana is almost meaningless without the Dancers who tell the story. Who can fault Beethoven's Ninth?"
3,Get it but wait for a definitive modern version,Regarding the Beethoven 9 it appears to be performed in a high school auditorium. Ozawa is animated almost like a muppet but the performance just does not thrill you. See the more modern Vienna Blu-ray #9 conducted by Thielmann if you want a visual and auditory thrill. Crisp 1080p picture with DTS high definition. Now regarding Carmina there is little to choose from so we are stuck with this. This is a very good performance but the camera work is not terribly sharp...this is criminal for 1989. Also very annoying that they were too lazy to give us subtitles. This is a very special composition that deserves better....so we shall patiently wait for someone to do a better job. Meanwhile get it though you would do just as well listening to the Telarc CD.
3,Carmina,"I love the Carmina Burana and this is a pretty good representation of it. I did not care for the Beethoven production. I am not sure that a video of the concert is necessary. While it is interesting to see the interaction of the musicians, singers and conductor I am not sure that I would order this version again."
3,high expectations,"I purchased those 2 performances on laserdiscs 15 years ago and enjoyed the concerts despite the flat sound and average video quality .Unfortunately,the video quality and sound are just as bad on DVD!! (despite DTS remaster).I expected so much more from Philips.I wish there was a newer version of the Carmina Burana on DVD;it is such a masterpiece and it deserves the very best audio/video recording quality."
5,Great Book.,"This is a really good piece of work. Some good highlights of the life of "" our Lady "" St Mary Magdalen. A wonderful work."
1,mistaken identity,"I did not receive the book ordered, instead ""Mary Magdalene and the Divine Feminine"" was sent. Did not return it since it looked interesting. I am more interested in the historical evaluation of her existence and life rather than the metaphysical approach of the author, Ms Prophet. I have read Ms Starbird's books before and have found them more to my liking."
1,Looking for perspectives,"Starbird's search for perspectives in non-traditional areas was compelling and enjoyable to experience. I expected to read about the essences of the sacred feminine, but I was not expecting to be convinced. The discussions about Mary Magdalene after the crucifixion were speculative but not wildly so. The discussion about Sarah and other activities in southern France of that period were informative."
3,An author with an agenda,"Don't pick this book up expecting a scholarly, factual account of the times of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. What is here is interesting and it's clear that Starbird is well-versed in the New Testament and various Gnostic texts as well as in the mythical and artistic references to Mary Magdalene. She knows her Greek, she knows about the Egyptian mythology and the mystery religions of the ancient world and their similarities to some Christian rites. What she does in this book and in other works I've read is to piece it all together into a theory of how a possible marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene could have fit into her theory of the ""sacred feminine"" and how much more kind the Church would have been to women if her vision of this marriage had prevailed instead of what actually happened. It's a beautiful idea but she's doing an awful lot of guessing and speculation to get there. Read it for what it, but don't take it as fact."
1,Don't take it too seriously,"I've read a few books by Margaret Starbird to see what evidence has been gathered to support some of the more far-fetched theories surrounding Mary Magdalene. I was disappointed to see that each outrageous claim that she made was poorly supported and neither proved nor implied anything factual. While I am a complete advocate of new interpretations of this biblical figure, I feel that Starbird is the leading cause of misinformation on this subject. I can not deny that the author provides an entertaining and thought-provoking read, but if you are a stickler for the truth and probability, you would be best to check out Karen king's the Gospel of Mary Magdalene before looking at this book."
2,Disappointing,Not sure if it is just this kindle edition but I was really looking forward to this but found it to be disappointing.Makes an interesting topic rather boring.
3,Western-centric and dated writings on Myth,"The problem here is not with Campbell's writing but with the place from which his writing originates. It is a 1960's academia entrenched in a Western cannon, believing itself capable of interpreting the cultural relevance of myth to non-Western peoples through the same lens it uses to critique western, and specifically Biblical, myth. Repeated references to ""primitive cultures,"" a complete dismissal of African myth tradition, and a clear implication of a Western superiority make the insightful commentary on myth a challenge to isolate.If you are really interested in comparative study of myth, look at some original texts and avoid internalizing Campbell's bias; Campbell schematically interprets the Indian Vedas, Zen texts, Navajo stories, Norse mythology, the Bible, and works by Dante, Jung and Freud.A discussion on the mythical implications of ""last year's"" moonwalk, or the Kennedy assassination, for instance, don't help much."
4,Feathers in the Fire,"I read this book in only a few days. I could not put it down. The characters of Davie, Molly, Jane, and especially Amos were written so vividly that I could imagine them in my mind as I was reading. The boy Amos was so cruel one minute and so loving the next, I was always amazed that the ones around him were taken in so easily, but then his handicap made him pitiful and they wanted to love him. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read."
4,Three Coasts of Ghosts,"I have been a fan of Nancy Roberts for quite a few years. This latest book of hers is a great addition to her body of work. Covering ghosts in three states (coasts) North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, Nancy Roberts is her spine tingling best. Whether mean ole pirate ghosts haunting a tavern in Savannah, or a tragic lover endlessly driving his coach on the annivesary of his death, the collection of stories is truly varied. You'll want to read this book with others around you."
3,Leaves to desire !,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
1,Footlocker sent me a black boot instead of the Burgundy boot,"What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product? I would have wanted to know if they didn't have the color they showed in the picture, which was Burgundy. If I had known that I would have never ordered it. I am a female and I don't want a black timberland boot. The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady. I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want. I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture, but it didn't work out. You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around. I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible."
5,One persons trash is another person's treasure!,"Candye does it again. A nice mix of originals and a few covers, this great voice always manages to surround herself with competent players and make a great CD. Check it out, even better...see her when she tours and hear that it is no studio trick. I hope this survivor keeps singing for a long long time. Favorite tracks on this one... ""White Trash Girl"", ""Big Fat Mommas"" and ""It Must Be Love""."
3,Candye great stuff for a Ole Fart to listen to,"You sure do kick ass woman;I may be a old guy but have enjoyed you just kicking ass and letting it all rip....It's great honest kick my ass musicI have honestly enjoyed your art that 5 years ago I would not have given a second thought to,Thanks, I enjoyed it and do enjoy the new energy you have brought into my home......Got get em and keep kicking ass!!!!!!"
4,You Need To Take This Seriously,"The author presents the case for an issue that has only recently come to light in mainstream media. An extensive analysis by the Associated Press has documented that as many as 43 million Americans (and this is actually true worldwide also)are exposed to a wide array of contaminants that are currently unregulated and which researchers have shown to have serious health affects.The key take away from this book, in my opinion, is a way to look at your own surroundings and to then take action to protect your family by learning what invisible toxins are assaulting you and what to do about it. If you care about living a long and vibrant life this is a topic to be aware of."
4,Moving upstream would be nice,"A biologigist, objective view of the multiple foci of carcinogenic forces in our environment that absolutely boggles the mind. I heard the author on NPR and was so impressed with her that I had to read the book. This is a MUST READ for everyone who care about their health and the environment."
4,wondering were the wanderlust goes?,"By far one of the most amusing Dragonlance tales ever told in the series. The story deals with the meeting of Tanis Half Eleven, Flint Fireforge and Taslehoff Burrfoot. The writing is easy on the eye and the action paces nicely older readers, my however find it a tad tedious in places. The writing by Kirschhoff entertains the reader with her clever use of words as well as her interesting plot development. She doesn't seem to bore the us with overly large sentence and paints clear decisive pictures for the reader. How ever she tends to extend a bit to the extreme. She introduces too many elements and characters with out the necessary subplot to sustain them or she fails justify their existence in the greater scheme of things. However, the book is kept interesting by likeable characters, witty and often laugh out loud writing and a genuinely interesting plot. A MUST read for all fans of Taslehoff and His friends. -Craig Michael Julich-Serventy"
4,Okay book,I was surprised that this book held my interest because I have never been a big fan of Kenders. The story is pretty good. It relates the events whereby Tasslehoff Burrfoot joins Flint Fireforge and Tanis Half-Elven in their travels. Flint gets pretty frustrated and nearly kills Tas on many occasions (and rightfully so). Read this book if you enjoyed the Chronicles stories.
4,"Typical ""Dragonlance"" (in short great!)","Following with the ""Dragonlance"" legacy, I felt that this book had a strong storyline and was very exciting (not that any ""Dragonlance"" novel featuring Tanis, Flint, and Tasslehoff isn't) At some parts it moved rather slow, and the ending occured rather quick. Overall, however, I thought that this was a good book."
4,Good tunes,"This cd is quite good. There are several highlight tracks including my favorites Love, Explanations, and Don't Stop Holding Out Your Hands. The music is good and the listen is excellent all the way. Not quite worth the five star mark, but worth the money. If you like Tugboat Annie check out 6 going on 7."
2,Not recommended for laptop/notebook,"This product is fair. It does function as described however it is not sturdy at all. As it plugs into the usb port, it is subject to being bumped easily. The exterior is made of plastic and the seams on the side are not attached solidly meaning when it's bumped they separate. Once this has happeded, the connection becomes weak and rapidly deteriorates. For us, they are impractical as it was used on a laptop that is often relocated. Had to purchase a different adapter that was a little more expensive but much better made."
4,Nice price for short distance use.,"I bought this item because I have several desktop computers at work that I use, though only one of the computers have internet access. I believe it would be easy to set up for a beginner; just pop the cd in and follow the directions. There is a wireless dsl modem connected to a computer roughly 20-30 feet from my computer to the other room. I get decent signal strength and quality (68%-ish), though I don't recommend it for long distances. Frequently I have to reset the modem after start-up to get it to connect. If you're looking for an adapter to take with you ""on the go"" or to use for long distances, I would not recommend this product, though if you are using it in a small sized home or office and don't mind sub-par connection it should be fine. Not top notch, but if meets your need, it's a good price."
4,Linux Wireless USB,"I needed a replacement Wifi adapter for my HP laptop because the OEM built in chip died. I bought this adapter because a review I read said it worked well with their Linux computer. In Linux it is true plug and play. I use Mepis Linux and I plugged it in, went to the Mepis control to input my WEP key and clicked apply and I was surfing the web. The link level of the OEM chip indicated 52. From the same spot in the house with this adapter my monitor reads 82.I have Windows Vista installed on this computer also and it works well with Vista too. The included software CD was needed for Vista and after inputting the WEP key in Vista I had to reboot Windows to get it to work, but it works well once it is installed."
5,ubuntu linux 9.10 64-bit compatible,"I'm amazed by this low cost usb wireless adapter. First things first, the package arrived as estimated in perfect condition. When plugged into my pc, Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit (karmic koala) recognized the adapter right-away and worked flawlessly out of the box. The beauty with ubuntu is, you don't have to install any drivers if your adding a compatible hardware which is not really hard to find. This thing is 100% compatible so, linux users buy with confidence. The range is acceptable (found 8 wifi networks) plus WPA/2 works!"
4,A Sparkling Collection,"How quickly we have forgotten that relatively small group of musicians who kept jazz alive in Britain before the advent of the trad revival. Sid Phillips was once of the best. A highly gifted musician he was at home in ""serious"" music as well as light jazz. (BBC broadcast a Symphony he wrote.Sir Adrian Boult conducting. This is an excellent selection of his popular work. It's not exactly great jazz and it did not break any new ground, but it is extremly pleasant listening. I would recommend it for anyone old enough to remember the 30s and 40s and feels any nostalgia for those days."
5,why i came to love russian lit,picked up this book by accident. read the first page and knew i had to buy it. now i have it. i have read it twice. it makes for a nice companion in times of depression. it is about a depressed old loser but it makes me feel better. why? i don't know. maybe i'll know after reading it a third time.
5,a beautiful look at bitter-sweet redemption,This is one of the finest books I've read in a long time. Dostoyevsky is a master at creating nasty characters that you love. The lead character (clearly a jesus figure) is saved through life and suffering.
4,Weird but satisfying,I really enjoyed this book. The first part is a little slow and wacky but interesting in a philosophy 101 type of way. The second part is a more formal story that is easier to follow and make sense of. I found it to be very enjoyable and insightful for such a quick and FREE read.
3,so so,"I was looking for the Pevear/Volonkosky translation since I've enjoyed their other Dostoyevsky translations. This book not only doesn't specify on the Amazon site, it doesn't even mention the translators within the book! Not on the copyright page, nowhere. Is that even legal? Someone had to turn this into English. After I'd ordered this I found the Pevear version elsewhere, read the first page (nice feature of Amazon) and wish I'd gotten that one. Ah well. It's an okay version and the general story won't change--but the style, verve, and wonderfully sly comedy of Dostoyevsky is captured so well by P/V that I will always wonder what I missed."
3,Doctor Who,I chose this movie for my niece since she likes San Francisco. The Doctor has to save the world from The Master in San Francisco on New Year's Eve at the turn of the Millenium.
2,Not so classic Who,"Overall, this movie was entertaining and, at the time of release, a welcome return of the Doctor to TV. The problem I have with it is what actually got it aired on FOX tv in the first place. It was too commercialized and Americanized for true Whovians. I was a fan watching Doctor Who re-runs on PBS as a teen and loved it. Tom Baker was my first Doctor and, though other actors were very good, Tom is MY Doctor. Paul McGann does justice to the Doctor nicely and Eric Roberts is a top-notch actor very capable of pulling off the villain, though somewhat lacking the Master's ""I would like to be good, but can't"" warmth meant to make you like/dislike him. It's not a problem with the actors, but of the story itself. It's like the writers either held back (or were held back by FOX) or the best bits of the story got chopped out by TV execs who only care about the money.As a movie on its own, it was good. As a real Doctor Who story, it's a fail. Your call."
5,Excellent Movie... Untapped Potential,"As a big fan of Doctor Who, I finally saw this movie recently. It gets a lot of hate for being 'different.' Almost all of the 'inconsistencies' can be explained within the Whoniverse, even the ""startling"" revelation that The Doctor is half-human has been explained in expanded material. To be honest, Paul McGann was a fabulous incarnation of The Doctor. I'm only disappointed that he couldn't have reprised his role in the revived series."
4,It's about time!,"There is much to love and little to hate about this, the only outing of the 8th Doctor on tv/dvd.Pros: The Tardis has it's best interior in this. I love the steampunk version of the central console.One last outing with Sylvester McCoy, one of my favorite Doctors.Paul McGann's portrayal. Even though he only had this one shot in the visual medium (not counting books or audio adventures), McGann did my favorite portrayal of the Doctor.Cons: The whole half human debacle.The Doctor's new penchant for physical affection. Maybe it's just my old school fandom kicking in, but until this movie I've never seen the Doctor kiss a companion. Wish it had stopped here.The movie looks a little dated, but not as bad as some of the older series. If you are a Doctor Who fan, this is one you must have in your collection."
1,Worst Doctor Who ever!,"The Dalek hold a trial aginst the Master... If you a Doctor Who fan, you know damn well the Daleks would never hold a trial, they exterminate! That introduction set the premise of how bad the movie is. It gets worse, the Doctor is Mr. Spock all of sudden! HALF HUMAN??? WTF? Yep, let Fox and American writers screw up a great British TV character. I turned it off in disgust."
1,Just the movie please!,"Do you know what I want? Just the movie! Please! I want one disc, not two! I do NOT want to pay $34.98 or $23.99. I want to pay about $16.00 for the single disc, no frills, no nonsense movie! I've been waiting forever for this thing, and I guess I'll continue to wait! The BBC just doesn't get it, do they?"
1,not available for U.S. dvd players,"i find it very disappointing that this movie, while actually great, seems to only come in a dvd format that is not compatible with dvd players sold here in the united states. I would LOVE to have this movie on dvd and have been looking for it for for a while now and so far have never been able to find a dvd of this movie that is compatible with my dvd player here in the U.S.i am sure im not the only person here in america who would love to have this movie on dvd. if this ever becomes available on dvd here in the states in a format form that IS compatible with dvd players here in the states...please let me know."
4,At last - the TV movie,"Finally, the TV movie from 1996 has a DVD release. As with the other Doctor Who BBC releases on DVD, this is well done with a multitude of special features, occupying two discs. The movie itself is good but shows some signs of trying to satisfy too many requirements of the various entities involved in its production. The love story could have been dispensed with, but I rate this movie highly nonetheless. Too bad it couldn't have developed into a new series, filling the gap between the original BBC Doctor Who stories and the new BBC series.Recommended."
2,"Yes, I remember . . .","having a similar reaction. Paul McGann would have made a splendid Dr. for a 2 or 3 year run. He had not only a great look, but a wonderful feel for the roll and I'm sure I'm not the only one that saw a bit of Tom Baker in him. But the story, starting with the super-violent beginning was dumb from the get-go. The car chase was eye-ball rolling and the loss of the British sense of humor was unfortunate too. Americanizing the Dr. was a huge mistake I think."
3,Decent but not Great,"I thought this movie was decent but not great. As a movie goes, it's good enough to add to my collection and watch more than once. I also enjoyed watching it. However, as compared with other Dr. Who storylines it's a bit below what I have come to expect. Most Dr. Who storylines are pretty engaging. So it's not bad, it's just not superb. I felt that The Five Doctors was a lot better. Of course another problem I had with it is the encoding. None of my DVD players would play the movie. I could get the computer to play it after I made an adjustment but the point is I shouldn't have to do that. I don't understand why DVD's are encoded for specific regions. If I pay for something I ought to be able to watch it wherever I please. Anyways, this is where I found out about DVD encoding, if it weren't for that I would have given this movie 4 stars."
5,8th Doctor on DVD and it's about time...,"14 years after its airing, Paul McGann is finally coming to DVD in the US! No more needing a REGION ALL DVD player to see the 8th Doctor in North America. This has been a much sought-after release for all Doctor Who fans 'across the pond'. The original DVD release of this story, back in 2001, was held from the US. This was due to the fact that so many different companies were holding the release rights, namely, the BBC, BBC Worldwide, and the US makers of Universal. After what was said to have been easy talks between the BBC and Universal, we are finally getting to own this DVD without having to order it from the UK. Did I mention, it's about TIME!"
1,Very disappointing,"After becoming a Doctor Who fan while watching the BBCs new TV series starting back in '06, I looked forwarding to watching this movie when I found it in my local library's collection. Unfortunately, after watching David Tennet and Matt Smith's Doctor protrayals, the eighth Doctor, played by McGann, was dull and lifeless and it didn't help that the script was 2nd rate. I suspect this was because the movie was targeted to the American TV audience by a 2nd rate TV network. As a result, all the quirky British things that make the BBC series so enjoyable were dumbed-down for its target audience.If this is to be your introduction to Doctor Who, don't waste your time. Pick up any of the recent six seasons of Doctor Who. You'll be infinitely better entertained."
1,Insult to a Great Series,"As a classic series Doctor Who fan I remember waiting with great anticipation for this movie to come out. I was SO excited to see any new Doctor Who, and I was SO disappointed when I finally saw the movie. I am glad they did this movie because without it we might not have the new series. If you are a hard-core Doctor Who fan you may want to watch this movie even though it is terrible just so you can discuss its horribleness, (if that's even a word), with other fans. This movie proves that Americans should just stay away from gems like Doctor Who. As an American I was particularly embarrased by this movie."
4,Completionist,"I know a lot of people hate the movie... and really i get that, but i had to have in order to compltet my goal of owning everything Who on DVD... plus i like McCann as an actor and he had some promise... the Story and the Master where were this story dropped flat."
5,Doctor Who The Movie,Not much to say. LOVE IT! Paul McGann was perfect as the Eighth Doctor and I love the energy and joy he put into the role.
4,Works well,Just as expected. Keeps sun off and comfortable to wear and appears it will be durable. Inexpensive enough so I'll likely buy a second one.
3,Brim a little small for hat size,"I found that the brim on this hat is shorter than usual for this type of hat. Great for kids, but adults will find it a tad short."
5,Great hat,"The Ultra Force Boonie hat is a great hat it manages to keep the sun, and rain off my face and eyes. The hat is well made my first hat lasted me seven years. The vents actual work good and they managed to keep my head fairy nice and cool. The hat is basicly water repellent. The price is a great deal and value. Only wish they would have keep on makeing this great hat in the USA insteed of makeing them in China. I still highly recomed this product for anyone looking for a better hat and not satisfied with the baseball style caps for running going on summer hikes, and fishing on the lake."
3,Not U.S. Manufacture,"The hat is ok, so far no complaints about the hat itself, however, I try to buy U.S. made products when possible and try to avoid Chinese manufacture as much as is possible. !!THIS HAT IS MADE IN CHINA!! VERY DISAPPOINTING, AS IT WAS CLEARLY ADVERTISED AS U.S. MANUFACTURE. Please change the ad to reflect correct origin of the product. """
5,Great Boonie Hat,"I can't wait for summer when I do yard work. This is a light hat, but it feels comfortable and you can hold to it during windy conditions with the included lace ties."
3,Sizing is slightly smaller then the hat I bought at Surplus store,I have the cotton version I got at a army navy surplus store that fits perfect. So I ordered a couple more but they are tighter then the other the first one I got. Both say initial loose fit required for continued comfort. My suggestion is buy at store.
4,Great Hat,This is my first boonie hat ever and Its great. It looks really well made and its waterproof.
5,Buy more than one,"The price on this hat cannot be beat. I purchased one in khaki and another in drab olive. These are great for the trout stream or fishing boat, hiking trail or just hanging around camp. The adjustable chin strap makes keeping it on in windy conditions ""a breeze."""
3,Boonie vs. Jungle = Boonie is More Shallow + No Free Return Shipping,"I am somewhat of a pin collector and so I was looking for a hat that would both protect my head and face from the sun and showcase my collection of pins. Despite research showing little to no difference between a ""jungle"" hat and a ""boonie"" hat, the two images looked quite a bit different so I ordered one of each. Aside from fabric and ventilation, which was inconsequential in my decision, I learned that the ""boonie"" had a more shallow bucket. The hat sat noticeably higher on my head and felt out of place. I've since returned it and unfortunately that expense came out of my own pocket. This probably didn't warrant a review but I felt it was necessary to at least share my finding between the two and at least reiterate that buying one simply to compare may ultimately cost you the customer more money."
3,Not Mil Spec,"When purchased from Direct Premium Buys this was titled ""Olive Drab Vietnam Vintage Boonie Hat 5910 Size 7 1/2."" It is NOT a mil spec or Genuine GI item. I have had many and know what they look and feel like and what the genuine mil spec labels look like too. If a genuine GI Surplus or Mil Spec boonie hat is what you seek, this is similar, but not the real deal. The main difference is that the brim looks strangely large because it is. It is 3/8"" larger tham the GI boonie hat brim. Not a bigt deal unless you don't want to look like Indiana Jones. The fabric is a tad lighter weight too. This doesn't mean anything is wrong with this hat, just that it is not a ""Vietnam Vintage Boonie Hat"" as it was labeled. Close but no cigar."
3,Sucky selection,"I haven't even got my hat yet, and already it sucks because of the limited selection they have for XXL. They need the colored hats for XXL as well."
3,"Good price, OK quality.","I bought 2 identical hats for my scouts to wear to camp. They fit the build for an inexpensive hat, but I'm not sure they will last years and years. I ordered the same size, but they are slightly different in circumference- one hat did not fit one son, but the other hat did. One hat came back from camp as good as new, the other one has quite a lot of fraying on the strap- which is basically the same material as a cotton shoe lace. It is quite frayed from the slide to adjust how it fits under your chin. It won't last much longer. For the price, I'm happy with what I purchased. If I had payed a lot more, I'd be disappointed, but they were not expensive, so I'm pleased with them and the kids like them. They aren't Amazon Prime shipped, so allow a few days to arrive."
5,Buy a little larger than your actual size...,"I recently purchased this for a hiking trip (yes, in the August heat!) in the mountains of Tennesee's Cumberland Trail... anyway, this hat kept the sun off of my face and kept the bugs away (sprayed it with Repel). I bought it a little large and was glad I did so because it would not have otherwise had the air-flow I needed to stay cool."
5,Good quality boonie.,"I ordered this and the olive drab nylon/poly ripstop from the same company. Shipping was reasonable, and the products arrived in good shape. Sizing seems to be right on, and the fit and finish are good. The cotton seems to be more comfortable than than the nylon/poly ripstop, but I suspect that after 10 wash-cycles they will both be about right. IMHO I believe that these hats are better well broken in."
4,Good hat- made in CHINA,"Haven't had a chance to put this hat to the test yet, but will say the material looks more smooth and ""polyester"" than it does ""rip-stop"". It doesn't have that nice tough rip-stop look I was hoping for. I bought it a size larger than my normal hat size and it feels true to size even after washing. The brim is a little unruly, but will see if that changes over time and break-in."
3,TOO BIG,"I probably would have given 5 stars to this product, because it is well made, good fabric, and quite attractive for the kind of hat that it is. Unfortunately, I ordered a size 7 1/4 and received a 7 1/2, (which is even too big for my husband should he want to wear it). The size is not indicated on my order, so I feel a computer malfunction took place. It's not worth sending back really, so I'll just say on the positive side, that this hat is probably worth purchasing, but in the right size of course!!"
4,I like this hat,"I like this hat. You can get better hats, synthetic breathable etc for more money but this works for me."
5,good buy,"Extremely pleased with this purchase. It fits well, looks awesome, and keeps the rain and sun out of your face. This is just a sick awesome hat."
3,It's a Boonie,"It is a good quality, but is is made for a child's head. If you bought for an adult tough luck."
3,well...,"Okay...I had this for about two weeks and was only able to wear it maybe one third the time. Now, perhaps my skull is large..whatever this thing isn't deep so a good wind gust can take it away. My only issue was that the neck strap (stampede strap) broke with to me nullified the point of the excellence. Before I could, with ease, slide the hat off my dome to look less like a tactical warrior and more like a civi. I was a bit crushed when the strap broke. Also, there are 2 vent caps on the each side of the head structure of the hat and one completely fell apart just before the strap broke. Disappointed. I'm sure I will just poke a few holes on either side and make it work again but it has lost it's appeal and I will have to buy another, in a different brand. BOO...The price was right."
2,Brim is short and floppy,"Wanted something I could carry on the motorcycle and cover my ears, still lookin'. Doesn't look at all like the pic, the brim flops right in front of your face so you can't see where you are going. Looks like a girls hat."
5,Common Sense Advice,Bought this book for my son when he and his wife were expecting their first daughter. Common sense advice given in a humerous manner and reminds Dad's of things they may not always think about in this busy world. Helps remind Dad's of how precious their relationship with their daughters will be as they grow up and how important it is for their Dad to be involved in their lives.we had three sons but I enjoyed reading it as a Grandfather and learning things I need to do. Thanks.
4,A gift that was well received,"This was a gift for a friend. It was well received; described as being ""cute"". From the few pages that could be previewed, I thought it was cute and touching as well."
3,Full of Fun-Low on content,"This is a cute little book with a lot of fun ideas,it just lacks content in my opinion.I read the whole thing in about 30 minutes.It does have some nice ideas though."
3,"Good Book, but a ""LITTLE"" disappointing","This is book is full of great meaning tips/advice that correspond with the different milestones of a girl's life. However, this book fits in the palm of my hand. Maybe I didn't read the dimensions, but who does?? Either way, I didn't like that it was so small, but still good information."
5,A better Daddy than a Father!,I bought this book for my Son who is a new Father of a baby girl. I thought the pages were insightfuland I hope he will read it again often. If he finds just one word that fives him hope for this upcoming rollercoaster ride called parent hood that he is on I will be beyond thrilled for them both.
1,"I'm sorry, Mr. Harrison- this one was a swing and a miss","After stumbling upon, at a relative's house, this collection of corny attempts to be witty and creative, I was shocked at how blatantly stereotypical and sexist this book was once I read it cover-to-cover.Although there were one or two cute trinkets, I particularly remember the following lines much more strongly:* Mom will introduce her to classical music- you let her listen to the Beatles* Remember, if you tell a boy not to play with the electrical outlet, he will stomp off or do it anyway. A girl will cry.* Cheer for her team. Even though they may be called the Pansies.* Teenage girls spend hours doing something in their rooms. No man has ever figured it out.* She may look cute, but her diaper can be as challenging as any boy's.There was also another about letting her mother have time alone with her, and one about protecting her from boys.In conclusion,Sure, this book is wonderful- if you live in the 50's......"
5,Family Issues...,"ACACIA is a solid chiller about an adopted boy, his new family, and the dead acacia tree in their backyard. All seems well until mum gets pregnant, and bad things start happening. On one level, this is a story of loneliness, jealousy, and extreme guilt. It's also a tale of insanity, revenge, and death. The supernatural and psychological elements merge into a well-told, subtle, yet emotionally-charged ghost story. Just let it creep up on you..."
3,If your'e in the mood for something different,"Then this is for you. They put into a category of horror bur it's really more of a melodrama with some supernatural elements. It's a good drama though with a lot of good acting, and an interesting story of how one family neglect and abandonment.If you're in the mood for needless violence, and gore, look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood for a unique movie with supernatural elements then this is a good one. A lot of character development, and some predictable twists, but overall a good movie to recommend. I liked the score, and the acting especially the kid that plays Jiu-sung."
1,Too Idiotic,"This book was a little too basic for really offering much help in the restaurant business. I was hoping to read about a few examples or case studies but the book seems geared more for devising cutesy by-lines and adages for select basic points. Instead of comparison figures for food costs or start-up costs, the book describes clean-up hints that seem common sense. The author also devoted a large section to franchises and opening up second restaurants that seemed geared for McDonalds franchisees versus independent restauranteurs."
3,Passion vs. Desire,"Wells has a beautiful way with language, and it's unfortunate how short this novel is and how flat certain passages are. I believe Wells was trying to convey how Simone felt disconnected to her family and to her own passions through the language, but somehow it just didn't connect for me. I think the story is marvelous and full of potential. I was reminded of Violette Leduc's ""Therese and Isabelle"" somewhat. And I heartily identified with the idea that through forgiveness for familial abandonment one finds peace and passion. I hope Wells only improves from here."
5,Great Read,This story is addictive. I loved it. I bought it as a fill in between other book releases and I loved it.
4,Uniquely refreshing,"I've read Nann Dunne before, but the collaboration with Karen Surtees has turned out a uniquely refreshing outlook on relationships.It was interesting to see the dynamics between TJ Meridian, Mare Gillespie and the folks living in Meridian, TX. How hate can turn to trust? How confrontation can turn into love? How friends stick together no matter what?Refreshing read with many eye openers on how life should be.I've already ordered my copy of ""Many Roads to Travel."
1,What?,"This book looks great when you're browsing throught it in a bookstore, but when it is actually examined, it is unclear and non-directional. I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Statistics. The examples are extremely long and drawn out, I contiuously found myself asking the question: what?"
5,Very impressed.,"Got this for my brother for his birthday, along with stones which I bought separately. We both really enjoy it, and so has anyone else who has played on it or even seen it. It just feels right to play the game on a bamboo board. We only started playing Go after getting this board, and I have to say that if you don't mind spending a little bit extra for quality's sake, you'll be getting a great deal."
1,Way too out of date,"This was probably a good book in 1975, however, it is just too out of date. The pictures in it are not that hot to start with. There may be a good idea or two in it but I would look at other more recent offerings."
1,A Review of Aristocratic Liberalism,"Kahan is obviously one of those so-called historians who disregards the particular elements of individual nations histories,which make their growth and development somewhat different than other nations, by imposing a broad theoretical framework on his subjects.I can imagine his poor students struggling with notions of how in the world do I explain all of human history in Burckhardian terms. Kahan is not a historian; he is a social theorist with few insights concerning the actual ""currents of social change"" within individual nations or nation-states that explain their development."
5,The sweetest movie!,This is the sweetest Christmas movie for both kids and adults alike! An excellent message to send and lesson to learn in today's world about selfless giving and the true meaning of Christmas! A timeless masterpiece!
5,Incredible New Chistmas Classic,I am a die hard fan of the Christmas classics that I grew up with. I was reluctant to watch any new specials but Annabell's wish is an exceptional and heartwarming special that had me tears. Before Annabell's wish the only special I cried at was Nestor the long eared donkey!
5,Instant Christmas Classic,"One of the best Christmas movies out there. My daughter and I love watching this movie. It has such a heartfelt message, great morals and makes me tear up every time. Great to watch these loving Christmas movies at any time of year.... keep the spirit of Christmas with you all through the year."
1,So Sorry for this review.,I dont know if this item meets my standards or not I have not recieved it. Some how it was sent to the wrong address or something.
1,VERY VERY DIAAPPOINTED,"I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THIS MOVIE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. THIS WAS HER FAVORITE MOVIE WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE (VHS VIDEO). SHE WANTED IT ON DVD FOR CHRISTMAS, AND I FINALLY FOUND IT ON LINE. I WAS THRILLED. WHEN SHE OPENED IT FOR CHRISTMAS SHE WAS SO HAPPY, AND COULDN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT. SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS MOVIE WAS THEY ALL DECIDED TO HAVE A SLEEP OVER AND WATCH IT, (THEY ARE ALL 13). THE DVD WAS AWFUL, KEPT OM FREEZING AND HAD LINES THROUGH THE MOVIE. AT ONE POINT IT JUST FROZE AND WOULDN'T PLAY ANYMORE. NEEDLESS TO SAY MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER TELLING HER FRIENDS HOW GREAT IT WAS. AND OF COURSE I WAS MAD THAT I GOT A DEFECTED PRODUCT. I COULDN'T SENT IT BACK SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE THE RECEPT ANYMORE. NOW I AM VERY LEARY TO BUY ON LINE ANYMORE."
5,heartwarming and rich,"A friend of mine introduced me to this movie and I'm glad she did. I'm not the kind of person who normally watches sappy movies when anyone has a chance of seeing me watch them. I am, however, a closet romantic and I must say I happily watched ANNABELLE'S WISH and unashamedly sniffled with tears in my eyes towards the end.I think this movie ranks up with some of my all time holiday favorites like ""The Year Without a Santa Clause,"" ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,"" and ""Small One"". In terms of length, it's a little short, certainly designed so for the younger audiences it will attract, but it's the kind of movie you'll pull out of the cabinet time and again during the holiday season simply because it will make you feel good to watch it. Cocoa or warm cider, a blanket, and a few children watching will make your viewing time that much better."
1,Annabelle's Wish,The Case was broken.The movie shakes the entire time.I thought I was getting a new copy.Not worth the 20 Bucks I paid!!!!
4,Movie review,"Movie was is good condition...not new like add had said, but works well. Should word advertisement differently so no misunderstanding"
3,annabelles wish dvd,"MY DVD PLAYER WOULD NOT READ THE DVD, BUT I PUT IT IN ANOTHER PERSON PLAYER AND IT WORKED FINE. I GUESS NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE DVD. MY PLAYER FOR SOME REASON JUST WILL NOT READ IT."
1,REALLY REALLY THIS IS CRAZY,"WELL I WOULD LOVE TO RATE THE MOVIE, BUT I ORDERD IT DEC 12,2011 AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECIVED ITJAN 13,2012 THIS IS CRAZY. I ORDERED THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SISTER, THIS IS HER FAVIORTE MOVIE. I DONT KNOW WHATS UP I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE."
3,Price ripoff,"For years I have not been able to replace my original Annabelle's Wish, and suddenly I see it available on Amazon in a DVD. A little pricey at $34.99, I thought, but ordered it to have for my grandchildren. THEN about a month later it is offered for $19.41 and lower. I feel I've been ripped off, and although the DVD is worth 5 stars, the deal was not!"
3,When you wish.....,"I am not a fan of this particular holiday dribble but it was for a future sister in law and she loves the film. I haven't seen it and wont watch it, but the DVD was mint and she was happy so score on both ends."
5,Stunning!,"For sheer imagination, this book is without peer. The story is vast and compelling, spanning centuries and a myriad of ideas. No other book comes close in terms of the imaginative ideas, not even ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Dune"". A.A. Attanasio's mixture of hard sci-fi and epic quest is also compleeing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good science fiction."
4,"Good book, but...","I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me a bit of Lord of Light but with believable science. This was, I believe, the fourth book of the Radix tetrad. Attanasio wanted to write a book based on each of the dimensions and time was the final one. What was interesting was his science, it's hard to make a novel about time travel and have it make sense on a technical level, but I found this novel quite plausible.He writes in a lyrical manner, almost mythical in nature. It was pleasing, but left little in the way of characterization. The book follows many stories (since it encompasses such a huge timeline) and that also left little room for character development. However, my biggest knock against the book was the last 100 pages. I felt the book climaxed too early and just kind of fizzled out in the end.Overall, though, a very solid outing. I strongly recommend the book and will be trying others by this author."
2,Too Complicated,"A disorienting story, much too contrived. A patchwork of events taking place in both dimensions, space and time. Definitely confusing and surely inconsistent. Consequently, when the protagonists (and the author) are stuck in jeopardy somewhere or somewhen, something or someone appears out of the blue to get them (and him) out of their predicament. I must confess I didn't understand all of it... and I didn't seek to do it."
2,Folly Adieu,"In print Merrill admits his faults disarmingly. Lurie brings a different sensibility to the task. This is no literary biography. Whether Merrill and Jackson pair more like Pope and Bolingbroke or Auden and Kallmann would be out of place. This memoir invites comparisons to Scott and Zelda, poets and their faculty wives. It's probably the best thing for future biographies that most of the worst and most prosaic things that could be said about Merrill and Jackson have now been said by a friend. Merrill fans will pick up bits of gossip. Readers unfamiliar with Merrill's work will be pleasantly surprised if they follow this book with his poetry."
5,This CD rocks...,"I have to say this is some of the best Rammstein stuff I've heard. Both Sonne and Links 234 are awesome songs,different than anything they've done before. I can't wait to hear the rest of the Mutter CD...."
5,Get this CD! Now!,"I know, it's hard for you to get this CD in USA or Canada, but: it's worth that! This song is the first release from the new album, called ""Mutter"", which will soon be available in Germany. Every Metal fan as well as all the other people are eager waiting for this new one. The song is great, all fits together: the hard riffs and Till Lindemann's clear dark vocals alternate with an tuneful refrain in which a female vocal hums the melody in cooperation with the guitars and keyboard. Get this CD! I swear you will never regret it."
1,DO Not Buy,BEWARE game does not run properly on anything newer than Win XP pre service pack 2. Most of the patches do not really fix the problems. Second Win 95 through ME are no longer supported or sold by Microsoft so drivers are impossible. Square Enix (Squaresoft) no longer support these games and will not help you neither will EA or Edios. I have tried to get this game running for 6 weeks and still no luck and none of the companies above will return my call. This game should be taken off the market and companies selling it should be sued under the lemon law as they all know this game is no longer supported and will not work with about 98% of the computers out there. By the way don't fall for running it on a virtual Machine. I have tried them all with the same out come. They dont have directdraw support or there are sound issues that are not repairable or any number of other issues.
3,nothing like the psx version,ill admit that i love the game. but if youve played the japanses verion and then play the american u will know what i am talking about. if you havent played either then dont read cause i will ruin the game.in tthe jap. version you end the game after saveing the earth from meteor. and in the american verison (the extended version) u save it after you defeat the 3 stages of septh. and if u like the weapeons after. this version of the game is the jap. it doesnt let you continue to play after you save the earth from meteor. and to tell you the truth its makes it rather boreing if u can beat the game with out knights of the round...if u just wanna get the basic's of the game then by all means get this one. but if u want the extended version with all the fun crap gl i dont know if there is one on the pc so ur best bet is to get the psx version.
3,"Too many errors, too little context","There are too many erros in the given solutions, too few examples of how to use verbs in context, and too little explanation.Spend an extra 3 bucks and buy the superb Ultimate French Verb Review and Practice."
4,Highly recommended for novice learners.,I wish that these exercises were available when I took French at school. I found them so helpful I found myself wishing for more!!!
4,French Made Easy,This book is really easy to use and I bought it for my daughters who are studying French. It is a great way to review the verbs - from the simple present to the complicated such as the subjunctive. I believe in repetition and this is fantastic with a review followed by a drill. Ten minutes a day at your own pace is just fine. I bought one for myself to try to recover a little of my rusty French. I bought the Italian version for my son who just started studying the language in HS.
1,Not worth it.,"I've had a pair of these scissors for 22 years. they consistently jam, and the screw connecting the metal pieces is full of gluon particles.If I had the time, I would buy a pair of scissors from any other manufacturer, it MUST be better than this."
4,Borneo,A good documentry about the island of Borneo and its fascinating wildlife that inhabits the land & sea.
3,not as acoustic as I'd like,"I love Steve Goodman, but this isn't the style of songs I like from him. I enjoy him more 'in concert' where his personality sings out."
5,A superbly presented regional cookbook,"A superbly presented regional cookbook, The Southern Cook's Handbook begins with chapters on the the basics and methods of southern cooking ranging from what equipment to use, to advice on frying, barbequing, and more. Twenty-two chapters are devoted to the recipes themselves and include beverages; appetizers; stocks and stews; salads; vegetables and side dishes; meats; poultry and game birds; fish and seafood; dressings, gravies, and sauces; breads; preserves and pickles; and sweets. Strongly recommended for the family cookbook collection, The Southern Cook's Handbook is enhanced with a glossary of cooking terms, and index, and an index of recipes."
3,"Does the job, watch out for hidden fees",My taxes are not that complicated right now. However with a house payment I have to file the 1040 large form so it's better than doing it manually. I didnt' like having to pay about 30.00 for federal and state online filing. That was in addition to the software price. Luckily I got a tax credit that I didn't know about which put me ahead. Otherwise I'm looking at alternatives if TaxCut doesn't cut the fees.
1,What a lousy piece of software!,"It put me onto the Schedule A, with a state tax deduction worth only $1800, when it should have used the standard deduction of $5350! Told me I owed $800, when in fact I'm due $800 BACK, so that would be a error of $1600! Then it took another 20 minutes to find a cludgey workaround, feel sorry for the people that dont have a good idea of what their taxes should be? So it's back to TurboTax next year, got this sad excuse for a product on the cheap, who knew?"
2,"Cheaper Than TurboTax, But Not Worth It","I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better. Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use. I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly. I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax. I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years ""Do Not Buy Tax Cut"" so that I wouldn't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK."
1,Misleading,"Although the program worked fine, the program cannot be used. H&R block no longer carries the State part of the program. Since you can't load the State the Federal wont work either. The product was useless."
1,Beware!,"I tried to use this program to file a very simple return, and it calculated that I owed the state $550 for underpayment, as well as a $230 penalty for late payment.I tried working through the program several times to find the error. I found that the program was automatically checking boxes that I hadn't checked! I have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem, which I was not able to resolve.In frustration, I went to [...] and filed my return easily within an hour, with a $140 return from the state rather than a $780 penalty!"
1,cheaper is not better,"It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it.I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the ""wages"" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand."
3,Spend the extra on TurboTax,Thought I would save money this year but after trying the program I found it unsatisfactory for my use. Had to buy Turbotax after all. I hope the Taxcut Guarantee is good.
1,Terrible,"This software does not handle common Roth IRA issues correctly. When I contacted (and paid for) an H&R Block Tax Advisor, I was told that the software has some limitations handling Roth IRA contributions and that I needed to visit an H&R Block office!"
2,Skip this program if you have investments or a business,"This Tax program is woefully inadequate for other than routine returns, and even then it has some real limitations. If you have a business, trusts, etc, it tends to fall apart. Worse, if one struggles with it trying to complete the interview for forms like K1 (and others) and then go to ""Open Forms"" to look to be sure it came out OK, the forms it opens are blank; you cannot find the consequences of your interview replies. It would appear that you cannot use the program without the interview either; it blocks directly filling out forms if you just want to manually enter your tax info; or does not include such worksheets properly. It was a waste of money for me. It gets 2 stars rather than 1 since it likely meets the needs for some."
1,Not worth the money.,"Continuity of direction is lacking. Often find yourself wondering what to do next? Also found it impossible to enter the bank numbers for direct deposit: The first two numbers just couldn't be entered? In general, a very irritating program. Ended up mailing my tax return to the IRS instead of e-filing."
2,Used to use this product successfully,"and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac, I decided to use it again. We have rental properties and when I started to input the information, the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium. Ok, so I did. Now, I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it's screwed up my rental figures by applying ""real estate professional"" to one property only. It's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.The questions the program asks are lockstep and don't give enough straight forward help (like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet- that's a great help-- thanks a lot!!) and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview. I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing.However, I'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine, it works OK."
1,If you have a mac .... forget this product,"I spent 2 days, many hours on the phone the phone. The program does not work with OS/X (10.4.8). The program does not install properly. The navigation icons are missing, and there are multiple xml reading errors. Could not import 2005 TaxCut return. The help button/menu actually crashes the program. The tech support will tell you things like... you have a ""bad .exe file"".... ""press Alt-Tab"" to get to the registration screen. I tried on 2 macs. Downloaded twice. Finally, I went to request my money back the website failed with some backend Oracle database error. There is a total lack of quality control on this Mac version."
1,Wasn't e-file Fed included in past years,"H&R; automatically mailed me a copy of TaxCut Premium Fed+State, which you pay for if you choose to install. I seem to recall the the Fed efile was included in the Deluxe+State version from years past. This time it's $16 bucks for Fed & $16 for state. I like Taxcut, but come on, that's over a 50% increase over last years product. I'm looking elsewhere this year before I install.Update: It's even worse than I thought. I think I paid about $15 at Walmart for the Fed Deluxe + State + Fed efile and $15 for State efile - that's $30 for the whole deal. Now It's $60!!!"
4,Very Satisfied TaxCut User,"I never have used TurboTax so may not have a good point of comparison, but regardless I have used TaxCut exclusively the past 4 or 5 years. I've been pleased with it every year. I actually have a Win 98, a Win 2000, and a Mac, and installed it last year on all units so that I could go back and forth depending on my mood. The data always migrated between systems seamlessly.I refuse to pay for the privilege of e-filing my taxes and always have simply submitted the print version. As another poster noted, if you submit early, you get your refund quickly anyway. I have also found this to be the case (even when I have submitted later around March it's only taken about 3-4 weeks). Obviously since I usually get a nice return I have an incentive to submit early, but TaxCut at least makes the process as much of a pleasure as paying taxes can be!"
1,Terrible product,"I thought I would save a little money and use H&R; Block instead of Turbo Tax. Bad move on my part.When the program downloaded my State of Louisiana tax forms, I got a script debugger error. After filling out the forms within the program, they would not print out correctly. The completed forms came out as gibberish. According to the help files, this is due to a missing font -which is incorrect. I have the correct fonts.So after buying the software, I had to completely redo my state taxes. There was no way to download the forms a second time -it can only be done once."
1,disappointed,"Like others, I've used this program over the yrs and one of the biggest selling feature was the included e-file. Without that, this program is not good enough on it's own merit. Thanks to the suggestions below about other alternatives. I will look elsewhere."
3,Why is state importing always so poor??,"I've used Taxcut a good 5 years now, having previously used TurboTax. It's not bad and gets the job done, but why has the exporting to state function still not gotten any better? I'm done with the federal and it's still asking me stupid questions during the state portion like, was I a full time resident of the state, did I pay income taxes to any other state and any property taxes, (yes, yes, yes, you have that already, etc. etc.) Sure it imported most of the data, but what gives? It makes me wonder what else it's missing or has gotten wrong."
2,This is a piece of garbage,"Cheaper isn't always better. Next year I will gladly pay the extra cash for Turbo Tax. The Tax Cut user interface is clumsy and a bit confusing. The program itself is unstable, locking up several times. The Deduction component is almost worthless. And now there is a e-file fee!This is junk. Do yourself a favor and stay away from taxcut."
2,Beware the Ohio software!,"I used the Block software to prepare my Ohio return - until I noticed that it did not provide for the tax credit for contributions to Ohio political candidates! That item was worth $50 to me. I then used the online tax preparation feature on the Ohio Department of Taxation website which was fast and easy and promises my refund in two weeks or less - a refund $50 higher than Block would have generated.I don't know if their software for other states is any better, but I sure wouldn't trust it."
1,Tax cut tax tables don't match Fed's,"I've used Tax Cut since 1996. But I'm switching products because H&R Block's Tax Cut does not match the Federal Tax tables. I got a nice letter from the Feds two years ago that I owed money and when I checked the Fed tax table against Tax Cut's, Tax Cut's was incorrect. Yes, I downloaded all the updates. So I paid the penalty and owed tax and chalked it off. Until last year, when I was doing my taxes and after finishing decide to match what Tax Cut said were my taxes for my net income versus what the 1040 form said. Again Tax Cut was wrong. So it doesn't matter how many bells and whistles a program has, if it is based on the wrong tax tables, your tax filing will be in error."
3,Gotta watch this carefully,"It did a good job until it ported stock information from Quicken. It ported two copies of each transaction. Lucky I made money in the market, or seeing double the amount would have been a shock."
4,I like Taxcut 2006 +State,This is the second year I have used this product. I found it simple to follow and a great convenience since we were doing all our taxes manually before. It was even better this year since it automatically imported entries from last year saving me the time of re-inputing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to simplify the tax process!I had no problems with the install either.
5,"For a change, the English version wasn't better","The English version, titled ""The Worst Week of My Life"" was very funny, indeed, but this American remake is absolutely hilarious. Kyle Bornheimer carries off the role of the hapless fiance with superb comic timing and the rest of the cast, some of whom you'll recognize from previous work in sitcoms, is uniformly excellent, as is the writing. And, perhaps best of all, the series tells the story of an American couple's week before the wedding...and then ends, unlike many American series which go on and on, long after we've lost interest."
1,Comedy for a targeted audience,"I bought this series based on the glowing reviews on Amazon and must say that I am more than disappointed, even though I only paid like 4 dollars for it. I will be the first to admit that comedy is very subjective and it can be difficult to gauge what people like. If you like the kind of comedy where people just do stupid things for no reason at all and keep digging themselves deeper and deeper in a hole by continuing with the same behavior, then you'll love it. Seriously, the main character is a lazy man who has issues with just telling the truth, instead fabricating stories when there is no reason to and just making things worse.The kind of comedy I like and that makes me laugh? The IT Crowd, Death at a Funeral (the Frank Oz version), Bowfinger, Big Bang Theory, Better Off Ted....if you like the things I like, then you probably will not like this series."
1,My Worst Week was watching this series,"This was more a case of what if your characters were too stupid to see any consequences to their actions than what if everything went wrong. I won't publish any 'spoilers', but from the very beginning, the main character makes the wrong choice in every situation he's put in and there were no logical reasons as to why. We watched three episodes before it simply became unbearable. What a waste of time and money."
5,hilarious show!!!,"Not sure why good, funny sitcoms like this one get canceled and other dummy shows keep going. I watched this show hen it was on TV, but this DVD seems to have more episodes and they are just as funny as the ones I saw when this was on TV. :-) if you want a good laugh at a guy's bad luck this is the show for you."
5,Funny Funny Funny,"I do not know why they did not keep this on TV, The series is so funny I have watched it several times. BBC also has the same type but to me not as funny as this one."
4,New Bossa is taking off...,"Gerardo Frisina comes from one of the hottest labels of the moment, Schema, which holds names like Nicola Conte and Soulstance and is best known for it's Break 'n Bossa series. If you think this small label can't have all the hottest latin jazz/ new bossa artists, think again. Gerardo Frisina's album takes of with 'mas eu quer ser', a uptempo, catchy song that will shake every bone in your body. On the whole, the album remains in the same tempo, with some easytune exceptions like the last track 'open up your mind'. It's a album very suitable for cocktailparties to get everyone in the right mood. The only bad side of this cd is the poor package (just one piece of paper.) You don't dress Brigitte Bardot with a bag. In that respect, Schema could learn a lot from a label like Basta records."
1,2 months and it won't charge,The watch will not charge and is now dead...after only 2 months. Back it goes.
4,Great Watch for the price,This is my 2nd MTG900DA-9V in 5 years. My 1st one started giving me battery problems and the back light gave out. Decided it would be cheaper at $84.00/ Walmart to buy a new one than sending it back to Casio.I love the look of the new 2 tone style band. The watch has a look and feel of duribility.This watch does everything it says it will do. PERFECT time all the time.It syncs up every night without flaw even in a basement. I have showered/swam/ cut wood/mowed the grass with both watches with no problem. This watch can take whatever you can throw at it and still give you perfect time
2,Solar Power - a useless idea,"I've been a G-Shock owner since they came out. I wanted to go for a classier watch than the plastic G-Shock. I settled for the MTG900 in December 2007. The watch is great except for the solar power. I live in Rochester NY. During much of the year I wear long sleeve shirts and coats. I am continually struggling to keep the watch charged. Solar power is a cool idea that is not only useless, but a real dissatisfier. I scuba dove recently in Cozumel. Twice the watch went from fully charged to dead during a dive. When I put it out in the hot Mexican sun for an hour it registered fully charged. I don't think it is supposed to do that. Lastly, I really miss the count down timer, especially when I cook. It would have been far better to scrap the solar power ""feature"" for a 10 year lithium ion battery and add back in the count down timer. I hope Casio learns from these reviews and changes the watch."
2,"Nice Watch, While It Works","I bought the Solar Power G-Shock and loved it. UNTIL, the screen went blank except for a small ""Charge"" message that flashed. This happend at 13 months. Returned it to the store who replaced it with a new watch. Now, I have the same problem again. No warranty and Casio wants it returned at my expense, plus return freight at my expense, insured at my expencse, and PAY FOR REPAIRS, since they say, ""it should not be doing that"". They do not acknowledge that others have had this problem, but I suspect they have.AVOID unless you want to pay for a new watch each year."
3,Good watch but....,"Interesting to hear that others have had charging problems with their G-Shock solars - as I did. It is unfortunate that a solar charged battery doesn't last as long as a traditional one. And - that's the problem. Not the charging system, but the battery. I changed my battery, and I'm all good. However, many/most people would not be able to tackle this successfully."
3,fantastic,"I use it daily. An essential tool in my relationship building with Christ Jesus, I highly recommend for the believer and non believer alike."
1,So bad you wonder what happened,"When I arrived at the university where I am currently teaching, this book had already been selected as the textbook for my Introduction to Political Science classes. I was so embarrassed by the book that I told my students not to bother purchasing it. Problems included:-simplistic ""dumbed down"" conversational writing style with many ungrammatical sentences.-errors in formatting and type-style; one famous Greek philosopher was listed as having a life span of over 3,000 years.-less than 1/4 of the book covers the areas of comparative politics and international relations.The author is listed as being on the faculty of West Virginia U., but he is not mentioned on WVU's website, so I presume he is now somewhere else. My email to the publisher's customer comments department about the quality of this book did not get a response."
3,Easy and light read,"A heart warming story of a woman overcoming loss. Sometimes I found myself getting lost in the wordy descriptors between dialogue but I did appreciate the grammar and editing in this book as there were very few errors. The ending surprised me a bit (I was actually pulling for the other guy). I felt a little cheated though because it skipped over Maggie's thought process behind her decision and how the relationship came about. Overall, it was a pretty good, easy, light read."
2,Flat Ending,"Changes of Heart was good enough to hold my interest until the last chapter. Then all of a sudden it was as if the publisher called and said, ""We need that manuscript tomorrow."" The heroine even chose the wrong man according to my expectations, and her reasons are left a complete mystery. I went back and reread several pages to see if I had missed something--to no avail."
3,A good story that left a lot unanswered.,"A good story that left a lot unanswered. When Maggie's husband is killed while testing a new aircraft for the government, leaving her destitute and alone, she doesn't know how life will go on. The only thing keeping Maggie going are her horses and her friends. As Maggie heals, she takes on a young protege to teach barrel racing to, and she becomes friends with two very special men in her life, Danny and Ian.Unfortunately, the ending to this novel was just terrible. One minute Maggie was at Point A and the next minute, she had arrived at Point B, with no explanation as to why or how she made her decision. This was a good book that could've been great if it had had a well-developed ending."
1,"Besides the ending of this book, which was SO bad,","she states in the book that the Arabian horse has an extra vertebrae in its back. Wrong! Actually, many Arabian horses have just the opposite: one less vertebrae which gives them a characteristically short back. Any Arab owner knows this when trying to fit a saddle & saddle blanket on their horse. Unbelievable that that got through editing. Allowing the writer to end the book in such an abrupt manner is also unbelievable! It's as if the author didn't know how to end the book and just got tired of it and wrote something down. Ugh! What a waste of my time!!!"
1,big disappointment,what a waste of time.....the book moves along well and is very interesting - until the end....it's like the author was running out of time and just ended the book - i'm sure she was thinking she was accomplishing some 'surprise'.....all it did was eradicate the rest of the book which was good.....if you don't have time to decently complete a book - don't write it.....
2,lots missing in story,"I got to the end of the story and had to look back to see if I had actually missed some pages or chapters. It ends so abruptly that it was a big disappointment. It was as if the author ran out of ideas and said, ""I think I'll just end it because I'm done"". Really a disappointment."
3,Changes of Heart,This was an OK book. It just didn't have the depth that I enjoy. It is good reading for young adults.
2,Disappointing,I found this book to be lacking in so many ways. I knew from the product description that the lead characters husband would die. I was disappointed that within six months of her husband being buried that she had two guys pursuing her. The one being in love with her before her husband had died. To top it all off the character knows this is going on but throughout the book but goes on and on about what a great guy he is. I found this book very hard to believe.
2,author omits the climax!,"I was enjoying the story--good writing, some good characterization...and you're wondering who Maggie will choose--Danny or Ian...but then suddenly a skip over the ""how"" of the choosing to a chapter where she's already married to one...what? How can you do that? oh well. Good thing I got the book when it was free. Didn't lose any money. Remind me not to bother with more books by this author."
4,Changes of Heart,I read this and could not put it down. The waiting to see what happened next factor was great. Loved this book.Mary Glass
1,Missing a part!,"I was really enjoying this book, until she wrapped up the story in the last 2 pages... given the pace of the rest of the book, there should have been much more there. It was like the author had a deadline to meet and decided to wrap it all up in 2 pages, instead of the 50 or so it deserved!"
2,Nice idea but lacks depth,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but, like many other reviewers, I kept thinking that I had missed some sections and my Kindle was acting up. I was fine with her choice in the end, but there was no reason as to why she chose one over the other. The book skipped through time pretty quickly, which the relationships not advancing in dialogue much. There was no depth to the story. I'd like to see it re-written and have more to it."
2,Cute story but missing so much!,As an avid Christian Fiction reader I constantly look for books that have intresting story lines with the message of faith mixed in. Going by the covers and summeries of these three books in this series I bought the set thinking they would be great reads. The 1st Changes of Heart was a bit confusing and left much wanting especially in the end. I got lost in the last few chapters wondering if I missed reading a chapter. I felt as though the author skipped a vital part of the book. The storyline started great but did not have much in the way of describing the characters or emotions besides the leading ladies feelings of grief. In all I found the book lacking character description and enough faith concepts.
5,Great book!,"The previous reviewer did an excellent job reviewing the book so I will just add that I really enjoyed the book. The Author has woven heartbreak, humor and faith. I loved the interaction between characters in the book. Each added something special. I could understand how Maggie would have a difficult time choosing between Danny and Ian. Both were good men. Both had a lot to offer. The advice she got was to pray and follow her heart. So who does she choose? Danny, the very caring, gentle vet who cares about animals as much as Maggie... or Ian, the very caring pastor who uses lots and humor and who can very much relate to Maggie's situation? Guess you have to read the book."
3,What happened,"I usually don't write reviews, but the ending of this book clinched the decision for me to write one. The book is going along and then - the end - she's married. You don't know anything about how that came to be. It was probably the strangest way to end a book that I've ever seen, and I read a LOT of Christian fiction and non-fiction. I even stopped and went back just to make sure I hadn't missed something. It's not a bad read, but just be prepared for an abrupt end."
2,Where is the Ending???,"I thought this book started out good and kept my interest. The last chapter or two was a complete disappointment, as a lot of the other reviewers state. I kept hitting my back buttons thinking I missed something this morning when I was finishing the ending. The ending just kind of fell off and no details/information were given for what happened - which is really surprising considering how detailed the middle of the book was (during the storm)."
3,Felt Cheated,I really enjoyed this story but I felt like I was cheated out of how she made the decision of whom to marry - how he asked her - the wedding! The story of ttwo men being interested in this woman was so interesting but fell flat when the author did not develop the ending. Needless to say... I was disappointed in the ending.
2,So blah....,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't even finish this one. It just seemed like the story dragged on and on and on..... I also couldn't for the life of me figure out why she went into such great detail on some things that, in my opinion, didn't help develop the story at all. Like detailing the engine in her truck or like the truck is only 4 years old, but sounds like it is about 15 years old. My personal favorite was when the snow storm came and the vet drove them out to Maggie's farm because he was a super talented driver and had a 4 wheel drive truck that would go through any snow drift. Now come on, I realize this is a fictional story, but seriously? I don't even live in an area that gets a ton of snow, but on the rare occasion that mother nature unleashes her fury with a snow storm/blizzard, there is no 4 wheel drive truck in the county that could ever go through drifts like that! Wow! I'm so glad I didn't pay for this one!"
2,Good except for the ending!,"I loved reading this book until I got to the end. It was the most abrupt ending I can remember in a novel. It reminded me of short stories with a word limit and when the writer gets to the specified length, bam! the story is over! I was reading it in electronic form and actually thought there was a malfunction and I'd missed some pages. I went back and checked; the story really does end suddenly!"
4,Changes of Heart,"I liked this story a lot because there was more depth and character development than most romance novels. The other reviewers give the writer a hard time about the ending. However, while I agree that the ending was abrupt(like the author was told to finish the story or else), I thought in general that the writing and story line was good. It would have been nice to have seen the character go through decision making process to see how she picked ""the one""."
3,Not quite right...,"I really like the style of this shoe; the thick sole, the double straps, the darker brown color - I would give 5 stars for appearance.The reasons I am rating only three stars is the way the straps fasten, they go through a partial metal buckle and slide into a leather loop like a cheap watchband. Additionally, the cut of the shoe across the top is a little too low. These shoes gave me... um... foot cleavage(?!!) that I didn't even know I had. It was not comfortable or attractive - for me this is a deal breaker and I am returning these shoes."
3,"It Gives You The Basics, The Rest Is Up To You","Gerry and Sue Hardy hae put together a basic guide to fifty hikes in teh State of Connecticut. Its easy to scan through and pick out easy hikes from hard ones as they ordered well. Some basic maps are provided and light overview of the trail.However, if you want more information, you are based served to research on the Internet. You will discover that some of the Nature Centers are part of other organizations. And these larger organizations offer different and alternate hiking trails. In other words, the book is a bit outdated.The moral of this review is for you to investigate these trails further as only a basic overview is provided here. Therefore, the three star rating sounds appropriate."
4,worked fine,"Don't recall instructions specifying ( uniformed layman) the yellow tab at end of stick was the primary sensor- but, it became more obvious as the side of bottle gave examples of urine reactions, or, lack of reactions, on a yellow backgkround.There are two ways to get a sample of urine onto the small test strip, per instructions. For men, the easiest way is a ground to air shot ( hopefully,with accuracy).I believe theTest strip produced accurate results. One hour after my use of a test strip the result was confirmed by another test at the Doctor's office."
2,Slow delivery,I ordered this product and a similar product from a non Amazon source. The other one arrived 3 days ago an this one has not arrived yet.
3,Russell is always interesting,"I always enjoy reading Russell, although in this volume he perhaps triesto cover too many aspects of his extremely busy life, which leads to quitescant and superficial descriptions. About half of the volume is taken upby letters to and from Russell, which soon become too tedious to read.Significant focus on his later-year commitments to nuclear disarmament."
3,Not very good,"I found this autobiography boring for the most part, but then I wasn't interested in his philosophical musings. And I especially found the letters uninteresting, so I skipped over most of them. I did find his relationship with and description of Joseph Conrad interesting. AND I did enjoy reading his descriptions of his childhood and of his love relationships. I shall never forget his saying that even if it meant being murdered by her husband it would be worth spending just one night with Ottoline. I would have liked to read a more vivid description of his friend A.N.Whitehead, but maybe I have a very early edition of his autobiography and later editions may be more expansive in that regard. I must say that what I did read satisfied by curiosity about this great man."
5,A Model Autobiography,"Considering that Russell lived such a long life, and an eventful one, and that this book (a compilation of three volumes) covers most of it, it's a long one. But eminently worth it.As always, Russell's style is brilliant. Simple yet deep, elegant and unadorned, always fresh and looking at things objectively yet with deep feeling.The book is always informative, engaging, and frequently hilarious.One of the nicer things about the book is the inclusion of some letters from others. Usually these are luminaries. The one from Will Durant, together with Russell's curt rejoinder, is marvelous.Russell has the knack of taking what could become boastful incidents--his imprisonment for objecting to WWI, his hair-breadth escape when his plane went down near Norway in WWII--and turning them into humorous, self-effacing ones.He also has the knack of talking about horrendous personal difficulties in a way that is objective and nonjudgmental."
4,Very honest and revealing,"I was surprised to see the level of openess of this autobiography. Russell invites the reader into his mind and his heart and seems like he holds nothing back.He seems completely unconcerned about how the reader will judge him, and that makes it a compelling read.The biggest negative of this book for me was that the letters tend to get boring."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE.

4,"""Oh, so is this the part im where im supposed to DIE now?""","OK, for the lover of the lesser known band, this CD is quite possibly the step up that they could need, there are some GREAT tracks on this CD... ALL NEW! i was quite impressed. It's also amusing to listen to this and remember all the scenes from the movie... so sit back, pop in this cd, chill with a Killer genuine draft, or a Cult .45, and remember what is quite possibly one of the funniest movies of the year with one of the most underrated soundtracks"
3,Song Missing?? Please Help!!,"It appears that this soundtrack does not include a song from the the version of the movie I saw. At the end of the movie when Doofy drives off a song plays that is not on the soundtrack. (The song seems to have the words ""oblivion"" and ""oragami"" in the lyrics.) In fact, it is not the song that plays on the DVD version of the movie either. I think the version of the movie I saw might be an alternative version, I don't know. Does anyone know the name and artist of this song. (This post and the Oct. 10 post might be talking about the same song??) Thanks in advance"
3,probaly a tight cd,i havent heard this whole cd but i have heard songs from some of the artist tupac and bloodhound gang id see the movie first check the clips on this site if you like those songs then get this cd
5,A must have,"Miles, Corea, Hancock, Zawinul, Shorter, McLaughlin, Holland, Williams.This is one of the greatest fusion line ups of all time. With this album Miles Davis turned jazz on to a brilliant road of modern sound and talent. SHHH/Peaceful starts out the album with beautiful melodies and the classic dissonant Davis stabs that were really brought out on this and Bitch's Brew. For having three keys going on at basically the same time, Corea, Hancock, and Zawinul work amazingly well and create pure magic and harmony. This album jumpstarted an entire way of composing, thinking, and playing jazz that ultimately shaped music today in more ways than we will ever know. Miles Davis will remain as being one of the most creative and cutting edge jazz virtuosos of all time."
1,Horrible Hiss Takes away intended silence,I am attempting to like this. The horrible hiss that fills in between the notes is louder than some of the music. It reminds me of the low quality of initial compact disks and the flat quality and amplified hiss that came in those initial jewel cases.This review is for the Amazon mp3 download.
2,Shame on you Miles,"there are 107 reviews on this album, so I don't have much to add. I am into jazz music myself & have at least 16 of his recordings. His finest work was done during his ""Quintet"" tears with Coltrane. Nobody could play a ballad like Miles with his muted trumpet. On the up tempo stuff, he wasn't the best technician, but his spacing was great. Miles once said(about jazz); ""if you ain't got nuttin' to say, don't say nuttin'."" He sure had nothing to say on this album. 2 stars."
1,UNHAPPY,"It must have been in the small print somewhere, yet I am not able to use the CD on any of my CD players. This makes me very unhappy as I was looking forward to hearing the music.I would give it ZERO stars if that was an option."
5,Greatest Jazz Album,"Miles Davis at his peak as he stood at the intersection of the rivers of popular music (jazz and rock) as they flowed into one another, and he took music itself to an entirely new higher level in he and producer Teo Macero's studio experimentation of tape loops and edits. Thus, this album is not only the first merging of the disparate genres of jazz and rock but it is also one of the first innovations of electronic/ambient music (along with the proto-dub/ambient sound washes Hendrix innovated on Electric Ladyland). Apart from this, it is also one of the greatest albums of instrumental improvisation ever recorded as Miles' trademark trumpet solos are accompanied by saxophone, bass, drums, guitar, and three fluid keyboards. Miles Davis' masterpiece--the first fusion of jazz/rock and still my favorite jazz album, it captures the late night musings and nocturnal wanderings of jazz like nothing else. One of a kind and ahead of its time."
5,One of my favorite Miles albums He is God,"This is one of my favorite Miles albums. There is a spookiness, a spaciness, about it that is difficult to describe; ethereal, moving, inspiring, wonderful. It puts me in certain moods that no other music can. Buy it now, even if you own no Miles Davis."
5,A Birth...,"This is it. Miles Davis gave birth to it on this spectacular masterpiece of an album. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, on this album Miles Davis brought about funk. It may well have been a transition, and quite a controversial one, but among all the hubbub, he create the groove. Just listen to ""In a Silent Way"" to hear. Once the bass starts up with the ""Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo"" and the cymbals start crashing, and Miles, above this primordial sea of rhythms, begins to scream, one can fully appreciate the raw funky power."
1,"Don't Buy This Album, Because....","...as soon as you listen to it once, you're going to want the Complete Sessions boxset! :)"
2,Ne pas habiter les espérances de upto,"J'a acheté ce livre avec beaucoup d'espoir et espérance. J'ai lu beaucoup d'autres livres de vaastu et ceci était un autre celui dans le feuilleton. Malheureusement ce livre n'habite pas jusqu'à les espérances. En premier lieu, ce vaastu de marques de livre très flexible et permet à l'utilisateur pour faire comme il/elle plat. Ce livre semble geared vers plaire l'auditoire et donner les une illusion qui ils practicing vaastu tandis qu'ils en fait ne sont pas. Le généreux pages, caractères et images sont signifié impressionner l'utilisateur. Une autre inexactitude, que je considère une insulte à la religion de Hindu (Hinduism est où Vaastu est venu de), était qu'il montre un symbole Nazi et dit le lecteur qui c'est un symbole de Hindu. Ce livre n'est pas recommandé. Mieux dépense cet argent sur les livres de vaastu plus authentiques."
2,Does not live upto expectations,"I bought this book with a lot of hope and expectation. I have read many other vaastu books and this was another one in the series. Unfortunately this book does not live up to expectations. For one thing, this book makes vaastu very flexible and allows user to do as he/she pleases. This book seems geared towards pleasing the audience and giving them an illusion that they are practicing vaastu whereas they actually are not. The lavish pages, print and pictures are meant to impress the user. Another inaccuracy, which I consider an insult to Hindu religion (Hinduism is where Vaastu came from), was that it shows a Nazi symbol and tells the reader that it is a Hindu symbol. This book is not recommended. Better spend that money on more authentic vaastu books."

5,One of the best ever,"I am thrilled that this movie is finally being released on DVD. Otherreviewers have done an admirable job describing it's greatness.After first watching this movie in a theater all those years ago I had emotions similar to those I had after first watching ""The Godfather"" and a veryfew other special films that reach true motion picture greatness. I havewatched it many tmes on my VHS copy and will watch it many more on DVD. Don't miss it."
3,Not too bad,"Too small, so called diamonds are barely seen. Dissapointed, but for this price it's ok to own couple of emeralds."
5,Liquid Mind IV: Unity,I was researching Liquid Mind CDs after visiting Dimple Records because they had Vol.2 and Vol.5. I ordered Unity as well as Lullaby because I thought they would be similar. Much to my surprise they are but diifferent in many ways. They are both relaxing but Unity gives peace while Lullaby releases more stress. I recommend each to fragile stressed out individuals
4,Liquid Mind IV: Unity,"I use this product for massage background music. All Liquid mind CD work well. After purchasing the entire series, I realized you really only need 1 or 2 of this style."
2,Don't Get the 3e.,"the content was fine if you just want general knowledge, but it was horrible visually to read and very out of date"
3,Super Reader,"The third Night Warriors book is also pretty ordinary. Five people must do the Night Warrior thing to stop a 17th century witch from creating a dream disease that will do very bad things.A couple of their own number fall prey to the illness, leaving the rest to try and stop the dream witch.The third Night Warriors book is also pretty ordinary.

4,Nice score,"I liked the book, I liked movie and I really love this score. the soundtrack is really captivating, it should be welcome in any Sci-fi score collection. I was thrilled by the first second I was listening to it."
5,A great book to inspire young men to read,"Ok , in my family the guys have a saying when it comes to reading a book. ""I'd rather take a beating!"" Ok well one is not on that list, but the rest are, so when my latest son needed a reading project, I turned to historical fiction as a way to engage him and get his teacher off his back :) I bought this book because I know it reads fast and the story is engrossing. Tai Pan is part of Clavell's History about Japan and goes well with ShoGun.This book was a previously owned copy, but for our purpose that is just perfect. This was not a collector's item, it was meant to be used and enjoyed. The hard cover edition is better since it will hold up to the teenager who is reading it. The book seems long when you first get it, but the chapters are short and it is easy to pace a reader to two chapters before bed."
5,"A fabulous, unforgettable, larger than life Epic!",I just finished reading Tai-Pan for the second time. The first time I read it was nine years ago. At that time I was sure it was one of the best epics ever written. Now with nine more years of wisdom I am convinced. Clavell writes a fascinating tale of ruthless men and women in 19th century Asia. The dialogue is at times witty and the ending is the best I have ever read. I am now faced with the grim task of trying to find another book to read that comes close to the grandeur of this novel.
3,Tai Pan good read,"Not as great a read as Clavell's Shogun, it is still a good read and an absolutely necessary read if you are going to enjoy Clavell's ""Gajin"" and ""Noble House"", which follow the descendants of Dirk Straun, the original Tai-Pan. Unlike most books in a relaqted series, Straun's Asian series gets better with each subsequent book.Best way to read these books is in chronological order, not in publishing date order. Start out with Tai-Pan.If you like historical novels, Clavell is the James Michener of Asia."
5,I read it every 10 years or so.,"I have read James Clavell's ""Asian Saga"" numerous times. Shogun and Noble House are wonderful reads but to me Tai-Pan is James Clavell's masterpiece.These novels were written by a man who lived an extraordinary life. He was an ardent believer in free trade capitalism as a way to improve life for all and peace between nations."
5,The best novel ever written. Hands down.,"Of course, that's just my opinion. None the less, TAI-PAN is a wonderfully written book that delivers in all the right areas. The characterization is great, the setting is great, the action is just right, and the whole thing is well researched. Clavell's my favorite author, and I thought nothing could beat SHOGUN until the last 20 pages of this book. A supreme ending for a supreme character."
5,One of the best books I've read.,"Tai Pan was incredible. This was the first Clavell novel that I read, so I didn't quite understand his genius. Tai-Pan is a historical novel, meaning the events in the book are loosely based on true happenings. Character names are different, and history is skewed slightly for story. Please read this book, shortly followed by the rest of James Clavell's novels."
5,It just gets you.,"I read this on the pretext that it was next in line from Shogun. and I was expecting Shogun stuff. But there is not much (except for stuff about ships). This may sound dissapointing for a Shogun fan. But to my pleasant suprise that is not the case, this book has a magic of its own. Plus the book is mostly character driven (except for a typhoon who likes to make his presence known) and I liked it. Good love story too"
3,"Only read, if you plan on the series","I found this novel a faily difficult read. As mentioned in another review, the broken English was cumbersome. It slows down a reader, who is interested in the plot.I did like the plot, which includes piracy, smuggling, deceit, and pride.I read this novel, so that I could read Noble House with ease by understanding the characters, etc. I'm only 100 pages into Noble House and can already tell that it is a better novel than Tai-Pan.I suggest to read this novel only if you plan to read the Clavell's series."
5,TAI-PAN -- TOP 10,"I'm an avid reader. This book remains as one of the top ten on my reading list! It's the formation of Hong Kong and its 99 year lease (that expired in 1997). Everything a reader could want: intrigue, glimpses into ancient culture and customs, pirates and torture, history, romance, and the connection between gold, opium, and tea. Fantastic and the first in a series of three. I purchased this copy as a gift for a friend."
4,Lots of pirate adventures set in Asia,"This is one of those books you don't want to put down. Great story that spans the life of its hero Dirk Struan. I can picture Sean Connrey playing Struans role in a movie. He would be the perfect Scottish ships captain. If there could be any criticism of this book, it would be that Struan is too strong of a character. He always out fights, out smarts, and has all the women attracted to him. The author introduces some unique pigeon allowing the characters of different cultures to communicate. It was also worth noting at while the British (and other Europeans) look down on the Chinese for their lack of sophistication and strange cultural practices, the Chinese saw them as barbarians. Of course our hero Struan was wise enough to listen, test, then adopt some of the Chinese practices. This was a great story and setting, I'm anxious to read some of the Clavell's other books."
2,Tremendous amount of typos when uploaded to Kindle,"I was very disappointed with the upload. There are way to many typos and symbols that has been transported over, so you are left figuring out what the word really is."
1,Tai Pan is no Shogun,"Like many on this board, I picked up Tai Pan after reading Shogun. In my opinion Shogun is one of the top 5 novels written in the English language. Perhaps because of the expectation set by Shogun, I found Tai Pan to be a huge disappointment. Shogun was a story of empire-building and forbidden romance. Half way through Tai Pan, the ""drama"" centers around a pending beauty pageant and which two tea-carrying ships will dock first on a different continent six months in the future. I started, but was unable to finish, both Tai Pan and Noble House. For me at least, being a fan of Clavell turned out to be really just a fan of Shogun."
1,what's the point?,"Had I not paid for this book I never would have finished the first chapter. The entire first section of the book spans a period of about an hour, and yet for some inexplicable reason about ten characters silently recount their life stories to themselves while standing around waiting for a ceremony.This unnatural inward dialogue continues throughout the book, and to me it was an entirely ineffective mechanism for telling a story.There's not much of a satisfying story in these 700 pages either. Another reviewer was not exaggerating when they mentioned that the suspense half way through the book was who would win best dressed at a ball. From the book's size I was expecting a self-contained epic; in the end I got some resolutions to some lightly interesting plot lines with a fair amount of items left unresolved.I fail to see what the time and effort were worth."
5,A True Portal Into The Past,"Tai-Pan made me feel I was really in the time period because the research was impeccable and the author leaves nothing out. Even the topic of 19th century hygiene is brought up. At the same time, it is a thrilling story with many things all going on at once. Two families are competing to be the predominant traders, but there are also the larger politics taking place between China and England, and the personal lives of all the characters. Clavell's characters correspond closely with real people although their names are changed and the same is true with the some of the events that take place. The author has an amazing grasp of social and political workings. Some other historical fiction writers with this skill are dry at times, but not Clavell who focuses just as much on his story as he does on living in the past. This book has it all! What more could one ask from an author?"
3,"Not Shogun, but still a good read","After reading Shogun I immediately bought this book expecting a rich literary view of Hong Kong and China. I was slightly disappointed. The books starts out with an introduction of various characters who mostly play minor parts. I kept waiting for a climatic ending, that never seemed to happen. The ending seems rushed and left me wanting for more. Reading Shogun first set my expectations rather high for this book. They were not met, but I still could not put the book down."
3,the lad has went down,"for some reason my original review was removed, and i don't really know why since it was overall positive and fair.here is the new, shorter version for those of you out there wondering about ""the new black"" . . .this does not sound like the strapping you have grown to love. it sounds like a tired amost exausted attempt. i absolutely adore devin and company, but someone has to be honest.if you dont believe me here is my challenge:put on a set of headphones, and then listen to any song off ""the new black"" and crank it.follow this with listening to any song off of ""alien"" or ""city"" with headphones at same volume and you will COMPLETELY understand what I am saying.and thats the short of it.cheers"
3,A decent album...,"It would seem that Strapping Young Lad is definitely the ""fan-boy"" band of the metal scene these days. Meaning...everything they do is pure gold. I have all their albums and I must admit they are unlike any other metal band out there. But I have found, outside of City, that all their albums are pretty hit and miss in my opinion. When they are right(You suck, Wrong Side, Almost Again, The New Black) they are phenomonal. But everything else on the cd IMO is rather forgetable. I've felt that way on their last two releases too. Some of it is just breathtakingly good and the rest seems like filler.Anyways..I just had to say that becuase I think a lot of people are under the impression that if it sounds completely different than anything out there, than it must just be awesome!! I like to call this the ""System of a Down"" theory."
5,Wait a Great Way to Leave This World,It has been announced that this is going to be the last album from Strapping Young Lad and what a great Grand Finale.
2,At least we'll always have their others....,"I get the impression that this album was rushed to production, and the final result demonstrates that. They had to get something out in time for a run on Ozzfest, and this album resultingly (at least to me) sounds like a good amount of focus, effort, and real creativity were compromised in favor of efficiency. That's unfortunate b/c their other 3 most recent albums are pretty incredble...namely Alien and City. But i won't hold it against the band. There are a couple songs here i enjoy, but it just isn't the same sound that i associate with SYL. Overall it is an unfortunate letdown, but i'll always have their others to listen to instead...."
5,unfortunately the last we'll hear from them,"from the first song to the last, Strapping Young Lad delivers a striking album. you will not be disappointed. it is cool to hear Oderus Urungus from GWAR on here. too bad Strapping Young Lad broke up. their albums will be collector's items."
5,A great effort from Devin Townsend and co.,"Although it's only been a little over a year since the release of Alien, SYL wanted to put something out in time for Ozzfest. You might seem to think that this was rushed out a bit too soon, but you know what? It manages to retain just about everything that is SYL with a little extra. I can easily say that it's excellent, and fans shouldn't be disappointed. My only gripe was that the two bonus tracks that were supposed to be on the disc aren't included, and instead in their place is a sampler cd. In that case, I hope they don't reissue this cd.Anyway, enough reading. Pick this up now."
5,A Great Intro To Digital Photoghraphy,"After purchasing my first digital camera recently, I read ""The Little Digital Camera Book"". I had previous experience with film cameras but soon realized that I needed general information on manipulating, storing and printing digital files. I foung this book very useful for obtaining a basic understanding of organizing files, using different file types and using image or photo editing software. This book also explains the printing possibilities, from do-it-yourself to local printing establishments to on-line resources for photo printing. ""The Little Digital Camera Book"" is relevant to PC and Mac users alike, and is an excellent value."
1,Caution!!!,"I have just read this book, and was happy that I read a friend's copy and did not pay for it. The author of this book clearly has emotional issues. You will find this out by reading the very shocking ending... Just as a warning to parents: Do not let your children read this book alone. In fact you may want to tear out one of the two optional endings to keep from having to comfort your children when they've finished reading. As for the artwork, it was very cute."
4,suave combination of tech and trad,"As someone who enjoys both the techno music scene and traditional Scottish and Irish music I was amazed at how well Shooglenifty combined two different genres into such a smooth blend of fun and funk. The album has joined the ranks in my permanent work collection, allowing me to smile at least once a day when one of the numbers comes up in the random rotation. An excellent way to enjoy new music out of Scotland!"
4,A trad-lover's guilty pleasure!,"Super-modernist pop-fusion/techno/world beat Celtic material, but also pretty playful and fun, once you're willing to get on their wavelength. These Scottish fellas play breakdowns and reels with drum machines and synth-sounding sonic washes buoying the fiddle's rasp, and endow their songs titles like ""Bjork's Chauffeur"" and ""The Hijab"" (one of several tunes that have a sort of an Arabic tinge...) True traditionalists will loathe such experiments, but for anyone looking for creative approaches to defining a modern, new Celtic sound, this is certainly worth checking out. Similar in approach to Germany's Dissidenten (though perhaps a bit smoother in execution ); imaginative and consistently engaging."
3,"didn't arrive, but got refund after end of ""expected arrival""","slow to communicate, showed shipping more than a week after purchase. Never received items, and finally received refund well after end of Amazon's expected arrival period."
5,Leviton 5378 Receptacle,This receptacle is well made and was easy to install. I used it to make an adapter to be able to plug my welder into my generator.
2,Pros and Cons,"It's got a nice bright bulb, and a very good, highly reflective cone which focuses the light well. The grip on the unit is pretty well-designed and comfortable as well.Unfortunately, that's the end of the pros. The switch is very sensitive, the slightest little touch or vibration and it turns on. I barely ever used it, but it was always dead when I needed it, and I had to replace the batteries every few weeks to keep it alive.Also, the cap on the bottom is very flexible and has very fine threads, so it's quite difficult to re-tighten the cap properly. The ring on the bottom is a very fragile piece of plastic, making the ring completely useless.I don't recomend this product."
5,Inconceivable information about the Columbia River Gorge,"This fascinating book, written in language easily understood by non-geologist, yet full of scientific facts that a geologist can appreciate reads like a detective story; describing in detail how the geologic history and formation of the Columbia River was finally understood. It can be used as a road guide and has many maps and photographs showing exact locations of features discussed in the book. A MUST READ FOR ANYONE TRAVELING THROUGH THE COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE IN OREGON!This book is one that has provided geologist with many of the keys and clues that are presently being used to understand the large flood features seen on Mars."
4,Catacylsms on the Columbia,I found this a fascinating book. It would be a significant improvements if the photos had arrows noting the features noted in the photo title blocks. It would similarly be a significant improvement if the geological terms were defined in a glossary.
4,A very good tour book,"This book excellently explains why the eastern half of the State of Washington and the lower Columbia valley are so curiously carved. It also shows how a truly observant scientist works, even though his vindication may be slow in coming. While some persons might wish for more color photographs, I believe the black and white format, particularly in the Grand Coulee region, better shows the power and scope of the floods that carved these otherworldly channels from bare lava rock. The drawing of a typical Bretz flood has to be seen firsthand to be believed. Another exemplary book on the geology of the West. Don't see Grand Coulee or the Columbia Gorge without reading this book."
2,"Thought-provoking concept, poorly executed","Although Arnott creates a striking comparison between cults and major corporations, it seems that he is trying to spin corporate life to fit his thesis -- like fitting square pegs in round holes. There is a certain defensive tone to his writing that I find oddly childish, given his credentials.I discovered several factual errors in the book, and I think his visits to the companies he mentions and the employee interviews he conducted were more ""whistle-stops"" than fact-finding missions. (I feel sorry for the Southwest Airlines employee he dismissed after using the word ""we"" -- isn't it possible she was talking about her family and not her workplace?) And to cite USAA as an example of ""separation from community"" is laughable. Anyone in this city knows that USAA is an integral part of the community, not an ivory tower.Too bad -- with better research, this book could've provided a interesting counterpoint to all the books about excellence in the workplace."
3,You say that as if it were a bad thing,"The cover of this book doesn't really seem to go with the content. The author obviously wants to worry people, to make them aware that Western culture's idea of you=your job is a bad thing. And I agree. This isn't a fault that corporate America has imposed on the world; this is the market adapting to existing societal conditions. People don't live in the same house or same neighborhood all their lives, so they don't develop relationships with their neighbors. Churches are having trouble finding and keeping members. Society values work over these things, so it isn't too surprising when employers begin to fill the needs that are not being met in the workers' personal lives. I, personally, would love to work for an employer who actually cared about my well-being and valued my hard work enough to supply a gym, child care, visiting massage therapists, etc. The author's cause-and-effect theory on this phenomena seems backwards from the reality of life."
4,Not quite complete recordings...,"It's strange that a CD, advertising itself as the 'complete' early recordings of this brilliant (and very influential) ragtime guitarist, should in fact, be lacking several of them - where have ""I wish I could see"" or ""I am the light of the world"" gone, for example? Still, it is a fine showcase of Rev. Davis' early recordings; but it could have, and possibly should have been better. It would have taken little effort to add the remaining titles, and there's certainly enough room on the CD."
4,standing in awe of my interest,"this book repulsed, angered, and offended me and yet i find myself wanting to read it again. i'm amazed by this book. though disdainful himself, cleaver was still an amazing writer who was daringly bold enough to unleash the esoteric wall of the ideologies of the Black man in the 60's."
2,Being Honest,"One must remember, this man is a convict, sent to prison for attempted murder. If you understand the mind of the incarcerated then you know it is all a front for parole.Once Cleaver was released from prison he proceed to get involved with more criminal activity both in the United States and abroad. In France he is suspected of the murder of a man that had an affair with his wife. In Algeria he ran a auto theft ring. Does this sounds like the re-incarnation of Malcolm X. Or does it sound like the a street thug. The fact that he became a crack addicted whore towards the end of his life renouncing the Black Panther attest to the fact that Eldridge Cleaver was a phoney only hustling the system to get out of jail.I read his book and essentially was bored. I had no desire to experience life behind bars as white critics and so-call academics do."
5,Throw your fist up!,Some people just can't accept the truth. Eldridge Cleaver tries to show the reality of blacks but the people who criticize it are the whites cant get a grip on reality. Ridicule is the burden on genious
1,at least he's honest,I'll say this about Eldridge Cleaver. He hates you to your face.He makes no bones about it. He thinks black men going out and raping white women is a good thing. At least with a guy like that you know were you stand.If the rest of our politicians and so-called leaders were this honest we wouldn't be in the racial mess we're in now.
1,trash,"this book is trash and so is the author. anyone who could find any meaning or ""depth"" in this book must be semi-illiterate and hate white folk an awful lot."
3,It had an overall deafening effect on me.,"The overall effect of the book was one of an eye opening experience where I was able to crawl inside the mind of a Black revoltuionary. The fact that this man was an American and not a part of a revolutionary force somewhere in the Uganda showd me that the crystal clean superficial of what we call America does not always have the same tint when we strip it down to its roots, with the oppressed. I wanted to read more about the author himself rather than read his highlt intelletual essays and for that reason, it took a great deal out of me to pick up the book after bringing myself to conclude one previous chapter. Not completely agreeable were some of the essays but at least they provided me with a new and often militant outlook on the situation that encased America for years. Cleaver opened my eyes and ears to an experience that will often be attempted to be left behind, but as long as the word is out, it will never die. ""Stay Strong!"""
4,Very thought prevoking reading.,"Mr. Cleaver seems to have been a very conflicted man. In this book he discusses his predicaments in his life and how he feels he came about them. He discusses his imprisonment, his life thereof and how he ended up there. He also shares his ideas on everything from corrupt government to his feelings about his convicted rapings of white women. I don't always agree with some of his views but they are very powerful nonetheless. If you are at all interested in the writings of Mr. Cleaver and have not read this book, I highly suggest that you do. To better understand his mindset. A very interesting book."
2,"Sad, Revolutionary, and Incindiary at the same time,","Mr. Cleaver wrote a semiautobiography about how society sets itself up along racial and gender lines. Raping women is reprehensible and evil and it doesn't help solve the racial/gender problem. It excabates it. Challenging the racist/sexist society by making alliances with people whom he considered to be his enemies will solve most of the problem. He should have shown love for his fellow man/woman. Didn't Jesus tell people to love your enemies, not hating and violating them? Later on in life, his views have changed for the better."
1,STILL FACING MENTAL SLAVERY,CLEAVER CLEARLY STATES HE PRACTICE RAPING LIGHT SKINNED BLACK WOMEN (BECAUSE HE THOUGHT DARK SKIN WOMEN WERE INFERIOR) UNTIL HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON WHITE WOMEN. HE HAS ZERO RESPECT FOR WOMEN OF ANY RACE AND HE WAS JUST ANOTHER CONCEITED BLACK MAN WHO THINKS THAT SLAVERY WAS JUST BETWEEN THEM AND WHITE MEN. HE IS VERY VIOLENT AND HIS IGNORANCE GLADFULLY BROUGHT HIM TO HIS GRAVE.
1,"decent writer, bad man...","people consider this to be 'in the world of literature' and serious?cleaver's a misogynistic pig, a racist, and a multiple rapist. that's all you need to know."
3,Educational?no. Inspiring? Maybe,If you want to learn comic book inking you may just want to avoid this. There is no actual explanation of how to ink. He essentially shows his warm ups then you get to watch him ink.He is a good inker technically but not a good teacher. If your a beginner or in the middle I do recommend getting this to help get the juices flowing when the blocks come.
4,fascinating and interesting work of practical theology,This book is an eye-opener in terms of the ecclesiology represented by Moltmann and opening a 'debate' with the other choice: Hauerwas and Willimon. Read this one and then read the book: Resident Aliens: life in the Christian Colony. Good stuff!
5,Contents,"As per a posting on Amazon.ca this supposedly contains:- The ABC Murders- Death in the Clouds- One, Two, Buckle My ShoeJames"
1,The worst...,"I just wish there was a way to get reviews on textbooks. I previewed several books ultimately deciding on this text. Do yourself a favor if you are a teacher and don't touch this book. The information is presented in the most dull way and further everything is DATED. I have never become so frustrated with a text that discusses current race relations with data from the 1980's. If you are considering this text, just glance at some of the data and you will get my point."
2,Disappointing,"Every now and then, even a fantastic author like Agatha Christie will produce a virtually unreadable book. This, in my opinion, is one of those books. Despite an intriguing premise, the story (which concerns a fairly uninteresting group of young college students) deteriorates somewhere in the middle and the reason for the random thefts takes an unusual and boring direction. The solution, which is arrived at with little of the skillful detection that Poirot is known for, is one of those types that you forget almost immediately after finishing. For first readers of Christie, please don't let this book influence your opinion of her quality. I STRONGLY recommend AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, DEATH ON THE NILE, THE ABC MURDERS, and FIVE LITTLE PIGS, which rank among her very best."
3,"Okay, but not what we needed...","If all you need it something to put on your keychain to light a keyhole, this should be fine. I wanted something for my wife to use when she gets up during the night. It just isn't bright enough."
2,"Led is ok,caribiner mostly annoyance","The light is bright and focused - Which is true to picture but moreso than I expected. But my problem is with the clip - it is very difficult to open, and doesn't open far enough for most items, key rings, claw hooks, lanyards. Don't bother."
2,Suspenders not belt,I thought I was getting clip on to the pants suspenders. Not clip to a belt. The problem with these is that the clip rubs against my back and left a very nasty bruise. That and the fact that I wanted to wear suspenders not a belt. If I have to wear a belt to use the suspenders that sort of defeats the purpose of the suspenders. I want one or the other. Not both.
2,belt,These have to be hooked to a belt and that was not clear in the description. Otherwise they were just what they said they were.
3,Ezmuny,"Not what I expected. Photo's weren't clear, description didn't stipulate 'plastic' belt hooks, rather than the brass clips, as I expected. (Even colored brass clips would have been fine.)This is strictly a 'double safety device'. For both belt AND suspenders..."
1,terrible suspenders,"These suspenders require you to wear a belt. There should be no reason to wear both. Although they're satisfactory when worn, you'll look like a clown wearing suspenders and a belt."
1,"UGLY, DIDN'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE","THE SUBJECT SAIDS IT ALL.UGLY, DIDN'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE, UGLY, DIDN'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE. UGLY, DIDN'T LOOK LIKE PICTURE"
2,Did not like the belt connection,I was looking for the clips that attach to your pants not the belt.xxxxx xxxx xxx xxx xx x
4,Good suspenders,These suspenders have a nice look to them and are easy to put on/adjust. I like the idea of hooking it to your belt. Highly Recommended!
1,serious problems with this set,"straight out of the package this set had two major defects:1) the outer blades leave a little V-groove along both corners of the dado, about 1/32"" deeper than the rest of the dado, so it looks like the dado has tiny little horns on it.2) the 1/16"" chipper cuts a groove just slightly deeper than the 1/8"" chippers, resulting in a stripe (you guessed it!) about 1/16"" wide and 1/32"" deep.needless to say, this does not make for a pretty dado, and it's getting returned.i did call Timberline to verify that I was reading their instruction manual carefully, and they agreed that I had set up the tool correctly."
4,What happens when your world falls apart how do you go on,"When black becomes white and up becomes down. Laura's husband Jeff has come up missing and she fears an act of foul play but there just might be more to this. As the story slowly takes flight unraveling at every turn of her life Laura finds herself not knowing who to trust and how to go on.Delinsky gives us a good story with likable characters that find themselves in a difficult situation. Will Laura be able to pull this together, and is there love in her future? Only time will tell. I would give this one 3.5 stars. Kelsana 9/11/02"
2,did not like the characters,I have read several Barabara Delinsky books that were good--this one was very disappointing. I found the characters to be very annoying. Laura was pathetic and her children were very annoying. When her son is accused of rape he openly admits to sleeping around and no one bats an eye. Then she goes off for 5 days and leaves her daughter with the grandmother (who we all know will be too busy to pay attention to the girl) and comes back to find that her daughter has lost her virginity!!!!I couldn't like or relate to any of these characters--Lake News and An Accidental Woman are much better books.
2,"Oh, puuuuhleeeaze.....","So, is Laura Frye a smart woman or a gullible woman? Is she a weak woman or a strong woman? I got so tired of trying to keep up with these questions during this book I almost quit reading. But, I perservered because I had heard this one was ""great."" Great it wasn't. Mediocre, with the ends tied up in a neat bow is the most I can say for this story of a woman who can't decide who she wants, what she wants and how much she's going to ""take"" from the people around her. I was disappointed with Delinsky's story here...find her most recent romantic/suspense novels to be much more satisfying-both with characters and storyline."
1,plot?,I couldn't find anything good about this book. The plot (such as it was) didn't make sense. What was going to happen was apparent 10 chapters before it actually did. The dialog was stilted and unbelievable. The characters were two-dimensional and predictable.It's just too bad that Laura couldn't have been revealed to be the sneaky tax cheat on the last page!!!
3,Same over and over,The story line was very good except the book was very repeative and draged on and on telling the same thing over and over. I liked the characters and the plot but not reading the same thing over and over.
1,the Life of Lord Byron,"I was excited to see the appealing cover and thought that this was a new bio of Byran. I bought it for my school library. However I should have read the detail and seen it was a photocopy of a book written in 1830. There is no index for the students to use. Once you open the appealing cover, the photocopied print is difficult and unappealing to read. A bad buy on my part."
2,Defective,I bought this item as a gift and was upset to discover that the last 25 pages were blank and that there was no publisher's page or footnotes. Was this book a misprint? I wanted an recent biography of Lord Byron for a friend who is seriously interested in the subject. Not a good choice on my part.
5,"""Rich, Young, and Pretty"" a musical romance with Vic Damone and Jane Powell","This is such a pleasant movie. It was Mr.Damone's first movie and the chemistry between he and Jane Powell are wonderful. It is a very shy, but romantic and extremely gifted vocalist (Mr.Damone), with a great vocalist and leading lady as Jane Powell. If you are going to start out in the movies who better to be with. They are a natural pair who meet and fall in love in Paris, France. Unbeknown to Miss Powell, her Mother lives in Paris. There is so much great music and fun and just a really nice movie all together. You don't want to miss the music and singing from Vic Damone and Jane Powell as they are great together. The story line is cute and all in all it is my favorite of the two of them. If you love musicals you will love this and find yourself smiling watching this film. After you watch this one you will want to watch ""Hit the Deck"", they are just as good in this one too!Cheryl Benim"
2,Only if you really like Kit,"I am very interested in Kit's life and have searched everywhere for books dealing only with her. There are very few, and this one is bad. It gives a very superficial view, and only stands to support the theory that Kit is ""the bad guy"" and that she is only in things for the money. Very bad book if you want true insight into the mind of Kitiara Uth Matar."
3,Not What I Expected,"This is A good book if you want to know about Kitiara and her early days of roaming. I found it exeedingly boring. It tells about Kitiara, yes, but it doesnt lead anywhere and the ending was stupid and dull. First she meets this band of outlaws and she gets in trouble with them. Then she has anoter adventure with absolutely no connection, then she meets up with them again, then she goes off and has some irrelavent romance with this guy and then she has the final battle with the group of outlaws and by the time you get to the end, you're just plain bored."
5,A great book,"Why is everyone complaining about this book? I thought it was a great, great book. In other Dragon Lance books, especially the Time/Test/War of the Twins trilogy, you hear about Caramon, Kitiara, and Raistlin. Here, in this book, you find out where they all came from and why they turned out to be who they were."
4,very good,"I thought this was the best Dragonlance books i've read. It explianed alot about Kitaira and the twins, though some of it was a little off base"
2,disappointing read,"I went to quite a lot of trouble to get this book, because i live in a country where dragonlance isn't popular and i was terribly terribly disappointed because it potrays the characters in the MOSt unbelievable fashion, that it comes close being ridiculous."
3,An OK Dragonlance novel,"This book was ok, but I wasn't expecting much with Kit as a main character. I found out that I hated her character just as much as I did in all the other books I read with her. It's rather hard to enjoy a book, when you can't get past your dislike for the protagonist. Other than that, the novel was written ok, but the plot was a little slow and disjointed."
3,A book you should read,A good Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet books. If you like the Dragonlance series than you should diffently read it.
3,Not quite there....,"This book is well-written, but it just isn't quite ""there"".... The story is interesting enough, but this book just has never really interested me. I have read almost all of my Dragonlance books many times, but I never could manage to read this one more than two times or so. It just kind of drags and makes me look forward to the next book in the 'Companions' series.However, for true Dragonlance fans, this book gives some insight on Kitiara's childhood and background. From this book, you can see how she came to be where she is in the Chronicles trilogy and Legends trilogy."
2,Boring....,"I thought it would be a good DL novel... It wasn't. The story just drags on and on without certain direction. I could barely read to the end of it, and when I did, i was very dissapointed. If you really like Kitiara and just dying to know more about her early years, then borrow this book from someone. If you don't, I suggest you do not read it."
4,"Good, if you ignore some contradictions","This was a well written book that worked well from beginning to end. I think that Tina Daniell was able to capture the essence of Kitiara. She is out to help herself and can cut ties with the past, but there are some ties she can't break - like thinking about her brothers and looking our for them.There were some inconsistences with this book and some others, like Soulforge. However, you have to cut the author a break - look at the publication dates for the two books. Also, these inconsistences only happen when dealing with Caramon and Rastlin's childhood, which is only a tangent of this book.If you want to get a better feel for Kitiara, read this book."
2,My opinion,"I have to say that this book was well written, and did have its exciting points. I have never really been a Kitiara fan from the start. When I read the chronicles I never really liked reading about here, but I am on a mission to read all of the dragonlance books. I have to say that every book I read about Kitiara, whether it is ""steel and stone"", or this book...my opinion of Kitiara drops very low. I know she is an ""evil"" person, but her character is a disgrace to all women, and she makes me sick when I read about her. Don't get me wrong, the book is written well, and does have its points, but Kitiara is a sickening character, and whenever I read about her I want to close the book."
3,An ok book by my account!,Nothing in it I didn't know before. But a worth read if you're serious about getting into the creative crowd.[...]
3,Recurring theme?,"I would have liked to have known that there were subtitles, even though I was pretty sure that there would be. It was similar to ""New York"" with its theme of religious terrorism, showing both sides of the fence. I don't care about that either way. If you have an open mind, just take it for what it's worth, a decent film."
1,Kurban,"Bad copy. Stops, freezes, have to go the title menu often to restart viewing. Bad copy, bad product. Would not recomend"
2,Alright.,"I got these for one use...Gaming. When I got them, they were great! The sound was clear, consistant, and the microphone was amazingly CLEAR! The only gruge I have against them is that it broke about a month after I purchased them. Other than that, I'd recommend them to anyone with intrests in gaming or any kind of entertainment."
2,"Works great, when it does work","When I needed a headset, I got this one for the Labtec name and the price. After 2 WEEKS the headphones stopped working, and now the microphone is dead. My first email to Labtec went unanswered,hopefully my latest one will be answered. Nonetheless, when the headset worked, it had great audio quality, and didn't make my ears sore."
5,Helping Young People Discover Theater,"In this wonderful new book, Lenka Peterson and Dan O'Connor draw on more that 30 years of experience to reveal how to teach and direct plays with children.

4,Great theatre book for kids!,A terrific book for my youth theatre. I am always looking for new games to play with the kids. The key is keeping things fresh! This was a big help and a great addition to my bookshelf!
5,"An excellent overview of ""Ma"" Rainey's classic performances.","""Ma"" Rainey was the Queen of all blues shouters, she was the one who influenced Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday. Her voice stands the test of time, she wasn't just a blues shouter she started as a vaudevillian, and could sing Dixieland music, ehich she often did with Lovie Austin's Dixieland band known as Lovie Austin & Her Serenaders. This CD is essential for classic jazz, blues, and Dixieland fans. Also visit 20's Dixieland style vocalist/washboard player Big Mama Sue's website(big Mama Sue is heavily influenced by ""Ma"" Rainey) at bigmamasue.com and see Big Mama Sue and Fast Eddie(her banjo player) at the next Dixieland Festival in you're area."
1,Big Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Jackson's; however, The Chase Is On was a big disappointment. The plot was cliche and weak. The hero and heroine were boring. This book is certainly not Ms. Jackson's best work. I remain a fan though."
4,Quick read but loved it,"I love this book a quick read but worth it Chase was very sweet and a man that can cook mmmmmmmmmm! it was a treat, the best brother i think THORN O.M.G!!!! i cant even put my experience reading that book into words it was that good ......Everybody has a different opinion when writting a review if we all had the same reviews or opinions it would be boring. Reviews can sometimes down play a really good book or up play a really bad book its up to us to read the book and judge for ourselfs and draw our own conclusion thats the best thing about a review its like a silent debate...."
1,Oh no!,"I wish I had taken stock of the other reviewer who gave this a one star :-)Terrible book. This is the first Brenda Jackson book that I've bought where I had to skip most of the middle section as it was soooooooooooooo boring :-( and unbelievable, cringe worthy, implausible - oh - and annoying).The part where he wants to share his family's 'secret recipe' with her after only knowing her about one week - right! That's when I got so annoyed at the foolishness I was reading that I put the book down. When I did pick it up again (the following night or so) it was only to read the last couple of pages, for no other reason than that I actually bought the book instead of borrowing it from the library!If you like Brenda Jackson's other books - give this one a miss - and definitely don't make this your first Brenda Jackson book or you wont read any of her others, which (some) are actually ok.I'm still a fan (just about) but I choose Beverly Jenkins over her any day (no dis-respect intended Mrs Jackson)."
1,Product Dimension Size is INCORRECT!!!!!!!!,"This is a perfectly nice roasting pan IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 16""x 11"" PAN. I ordered it based on the Product Details, which list the dimensions as 20 x 12.3 x 4 inches. After receiving it, it looked a little small, so I measured it and it was 16"" x 11""; not the larger size listed. The pan arrived brand new, but the box was taped up as if someone else had returned it also. I called Amazon and was told they would remove the product from their website until they could verify the measurements. This has not happened and it has been over 3 weeks since I returned the item. Amazon did not send me an incorrect item; what is incorrect are the dimensions listed on their website for this product."
5,Good One!,"When the Sleuth is caught in the storm, Frank and Joe are helpless. But they have another mystery on their hands, when they see a wallet containing two thousand dollars flying in the air. They also have to find the missing yatch."
5,Transforming Difficulties into Easy-Reading,"This most recent book by Wilmott really caught my eyes. Unlike his previous two books on mathematics of finance, this new book is much easier to read by an engineer without finance background. Wilmott is clean in mathematics, and each chapters are relatively short, so you'll have sense of accomplishment along reading the book. Wilmott in this book also have some his unpublished insight and mathematical formula. I think this is a must-have for those who want to be a expert in financial engineering."
1,This book needs to go more in depth,"The book is thorough in topics, but it lacks the depth of a true textbook. It can give a good introduction to the subjects , but it just lacks the explanations, and the examples to really give a reader a concrete understanding of the subject."
5,I love this album,I have this album on my Ipod. It's been seven years since Hunter Hayes produced this product. I hope he produces an updated album. It should be interesting to hear him after his voice breaks.
1,IS IT AMAZON OR HUNTER?,I've listened to all the clips and I don't know if its just the way the clips sound or if the cd really sounds like that. If that's how the cd sounds - like sung through a tin can and a sound of jibberish. . . I wouldn't buy it for anything. I couldn't make out a single identifiable word on even the english songs. . .
3,House: Seasons 1-5 DVD's wont play,"I bought House: Seasons 1-5, found out season 3 is no good, dvd are see throw and wont play not even in my computer. season 2 the last 2 dvd's won't play but there not see throw. season 1 the 2nd dvd won't play.. tryed all 3 dvd players in the house and nothing. the newest dvd play is sony and a month old.Haven't gotten to season 4 or 5 yet.I will never buy a boxed set again.House: Seasons 1-5"
3,Very Strange,Alright lets see first House Rocks! but i wouldn't buy a box with 5 seasons in it then have six come out maybe a year from now. I hate to split up DVD sets more and more shows seems to put together collection sets that are more expensive than each season individually... oh well they are still getting my money and if you want a complete set wait till the series finally for the complete series box set that inevitably will be created.
1,Disappointed,I ordered the House Series for Fathers Day gift but to my dismal when I was suppose to receive the product I was told I was receiving a full refund. The company did not have the item in stock as their website inventory stated and at that late date I did not have the time to reorder the product from another company--very disappointing.Amazon was very good with communicating the situation with me and I received my refund right away.
1,house seasons 1-5,This item was damaged-I told the seller but heard nothing. Thumbs down! Content is great on episodes that are undamaged.
2,Let the Buyer Beware,"I should say that I bought the boxed set for seasons 1-4 and I bought season five separately, but if the producer is the same for this newest box set, you'd be better off buying the set at a store with a generous return policy.When I got my set, I was thrilled. Then, as I played through each season, I started to see skipped scenes and freezing and episodes starting in the middle instead of at the beginning. In two cases, I didn't get to see the resolution of the cases at all.Because it takes so long to watch all the episodes, by the time I realized there was a problem it was too late to return the set. I notice that the set I bought is no longer being produced; I assume that the manufactor is simply making seasons 1-5 instead.To pay $100.00 for defective disks is unconscionable. I love the show but certainly wouldn't recommend this set to anyone."
3,Possibly Pirated,"I am going to do some research on who exactly sold me my ""Box Set"" because the box set that I bought used on Amazon is a mix and match of what I think is pirated material.One of the seasons I have has subtitles that can't be turned off another of them has the FOX logo plastered in the bottom right hand side of the screen, needless to say that is not what I payed good money for...I am new to Amazon so if anyone could point me in the right direction for figuring out who exactly I bought it from, I would be extremely happy because they owe me a ""like new"" copy that they advertised.[...]THX,Brance"
5,House season 1-5,I received the product on a very timely fashion and in great condition. The item purchased was a very reasonable price and I plan on using this person for future orders.
2,"So, this is not a new edition, just a reissue of the same old version...","Then I guess it is not all 16x9 widescreen, as stated, since the first two seasons were released in 4x3 letterbox (and awful image) format.Better wait for the blu-ray edition..."
4,"Five-star music, two-star recording","No need to rehash all the praise for Charley Patton; he is in fact one of the all-time great Delta blues singers, and this album contains some of his finest material. All the more reason, then, to regret the terrible audio quality on this CD, which the album-notes try to excuse by the usual talk about ""authenticity."" There is no good reason, especially in a digital format, to leave in the deafening clicks, pops, and static that all but ruin several of these great songs. One hopes that they will someday be released by a label that isn't too lazy to make the minimal engineering effort necessary to do justice to this man's genius."
5,"If I Could, I Would Marry These","Okay, so I probably wouldn't go that far, but I wouldn't be caught dead without them. I use them to clip my horses (mostly minis) in the spring. So the hair that I'm going through is about 3"" long, and THICK! Goes through the hair like it's NOOOOTTTHHHHIIING!!!!!!!! I'm also a professional dog groomer, and these things get used every day. I've had mine for about 4 +/- years, and I haven't had a problem with them yet. DEFINITELY worth the money (although I would go with the longer cord, just to make things easier)!"
1,terrible,I have had these clippers for over 3 yrs and have had nothing but trouble with them.Not worth the money!They bog down and just won't cut.
1,clipper blades do not fit,"Ongoing trouble getting blades to stay engaged. the supplier talked me into trying other ""techniques"" until the warranty ran out - the problems continue and supplier says it's now out of warranty. very poor customer service and unsatisfactory product."
2,Don't buy it,"I had to buy this book for a class. I was very disappointed.This edition has several typos and mistakes on the tables. The examples and problems sections are really irritating, sometimes they show a couple of equations and write 5 problems over the same equation over and over again, and I have found instances where the ""answers to selected problems"" section show incorrect information. There is very little physics that you can learn from those problems.It seems that it is hard to find good books on Medical Imaging, but I highly recommend ""The essential physics of medical imaging"" (Bushberg. et al.) This is a very good review of the imaging techniques but it is not very quantitative. A more quantitative book I would recommend is ""Medical Imaging: signals and systems"" by Jerry L. Price.If you have an option, don't waste your money on this book."
5,Comprehensive Book,"""...fulfills the authors goal of providing an up-to-date survey of the physics of medical imaging in a format that will appeal to students and educators alike. The coverage of topics is sufficiently comprehensive, making it a suitable introductory text for a number of imaging-oriented courses."" (Radiology, January 2004)"
3,Room for expansion?,"According to another website, these are the titles included:Disc #1The Astronauts: US Project MercuryFriendship 7Disc #2Assignment: Shoot the MoonThe Eagle Has LandedDisc #3Apollo 13: Houston, We Have a ProblemSmall Steps, Giant Strides: 1973Disc #4Who's Out There?The Mission of Apollo/SoyuzThe Space Shuttle, A Remarkable Flying MachineThere are other DVD collections currently available (at lower prices!) that offer more variety. This set might be worth it since it has the sanction of the National Archives; perhaps these films have been restored. If not, you can find better value in other products."
4,"Expensive, but worth it when you need it","If you have an amateur interest in photographic optics, there are excellent books for a lot less money. But if you really need the most in-depth information in a wide range of detailed topics and applications, this one is well worth the price. Though for $150 you'd think they'd throw in a hard cover, wouldn't you?"
3,"A little too low rent, but with possibilities","Marvin Richards could have had a real winner with this coat if they had used a better quality faux fur and avoided the cheap looking plastic button - as it is the cheap fur somewhat spoils the overall effect.Pros: Flattering cut, comfortable, wonderfully warm, nice lining, inexpensive.Cons: Fur looks and feels a little too fake - and not in a nice way, especially at shoulder seams and cuffs. Nobody will think this is a real mink or even a high quality faux fur - however, the fake fur isn't so bad that you will look totally tacky either (just a little tacky).I kept the coat because I needed something full-length and super-warm for the NY winter weather and in that respect this coat shines. I replaced the plastic button with something a little higher end and, relying on the beautiful cut of this coat and some sharp accessorizing, I think/hope I have managed to transform ""a little tacky"" to ""vintage retro chic""."
2,Short term use only,"Does what it is supposed to, but NOT for long term use. Bends fairly easily, somewhat difficult to use."
4,Great for the money,"Was looking for a cheap stereo with cd, and this was it. It works great, and the remote is a must as I can't reach the unit where it has to be in a tractor.Only minus is that it doesn't seem to have anti-skip. The cd stops a lot going over bumps (at least in a tractor trailer!).Over all, I would buy this again."
1,bad after six months,"I would NOT buy this item from this supplier again! The cable in the regulator is so thin, it twisted on the spool and became forever kinked. The window would gradually do down 10 inches, then 6 and then not at all. JUNK! I am irate because I can't go thru the drive thru at all. I live in upstate NY and fiddling around with this in the cold of winter makes me furious. I looked at the OEM part and there was half as much cable and the cable was thicker."
2,Only lasted 2 years. Cable snapped again!,"I have done 3 different regulators on 3 different vehicles. I had to rewire 1, 1 the cable broke after 2 years, and the 3rd goes up real slow now. I think I'm done with Dorman regulators. I think I'll spend a little more money and get something a little better."
3,What was so secret?,I just finished The Secret Woman...what are they talking about? Anna doesn't change! There's no passionnate being there....I just didn't like this book. It had no point.
2,A highly misleading title...,"Don't get me wrong. The music on this disc is excellent, but it doesn't have anything to do with rap. The rhythms are straightup country blues for the most part, with a few recitation pieces and country styled things. I like this kind of music, and I own a lot of discs like this one, but I also like rap music, and this ain't it! If it had been advertised as The Roots of the Talking Blues, I would have given it five stars."
5,marine star,"i received this watch as a birthday present, the watch is beautiful and elegant. its not big, and honestly the picture doesnt do it justice. highly recommend it."
4,very good but small,"i red the other reviews before buying this watch. everybody said that the watch is big for a woman, but when i opened the box the watch was smaller than i thought. anyway it's a very good and classy looking watch, especially the colour."
1,Very disappointed in receiving used book.,"I was very disappointed upon receiving this item. I thought I was receiving a new book. Instead it is very ""used."" I am hoping to return it. It even had a note the previous owner had slipped into the box when ""gifting"" the book."
5,Adorable,This is a durable book for any child. First my son enjoyed it and when my daughter was old enough she enjoyed it. I also loved Grandpa's brief case and Moms bag...it looks like an LL Bean bag.
3,FAB FINDbut not recommended for TODDLERS,"o.k. so I think I bought this litte gem of an interactive book more for myself than my 18 mnth old. It would have been something I would of adored as a little girl, with it's pockets of treasures and flaps to pull out with brightly colored pictures of granny and baby. The only problem is that it is NOT DURABLE enough for a toddler. I don't reccomend it for children under 3 yrs old or if your child is a little rough with things. This will not last. It is made out of cardboard and alot of the little flaps are folded so that they can EASILY tear. You'll spend more time gluing the flaps back together than enjoying this great little book. Save it for later or bring out your inner liitle girl!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my 15 mo. old granddaughter (obviously not the age recommended), and I was disappointed. I expected more little dodads and gadgets for her to pull out and play with. I was thinking it would be a cardboard book full of goodies, but it is definitely just a ""book"" and not a box of fun playthings to take in and out. She may be a little more interested in it when she gets older, but I think she will have more fun if I make up my own little purse of goodies just for her."
2,Big Disappointment,"My Granny's Purse was a big disapointment for me. I wish I had read the reviews of others before buying. THey are right.. it's not for a small child. I bought it for my 18mth old daughter. She didn't like it at all. The sunglasses are the only thing she played with and they broke almost instantly. It's all cardboard.. and so it's not durable. For a older child, this might work. But it doesn't have much to do really and its text doesn't have much of a point. I don't know whether this is a book or a toy but it falls short in both categories. thanks!"
2,Not Durable,"Although this is a cute idea, I would not recommend this for small children (which doesn't make sense because that is who it is for, right?). There are too many things to try to keep track of and too many ways it can be destoyed by little hands. This is one of those toys to keep on a high shelf and to only be looked at with adult supervision."
3,obsiously,"this is the great second single from tom, harry, danny and dougy. this is a very good come back from the number 1 debut single '5 colours in her hair'. with a really bright future ahead of them, mcly have given themselves a gigantic head start for their hopefully long career. obsiously this single will give the foursome a confidence boost for the near future."
1,Not her best,I have read several of Thirkell's book but this one was absolutely boring. No plot to speak of. I have enjoyed her others.
2,amazingly boring,"I agree that this book is one of the most boring ever written. I also read ""Coronation Summer"", by the same author, and that book was much better. The book did exert a strange fascination; I kept reading, wondering if the author would finally break down and make something happen. At one or two points she almost did, but somehow restrained herself. The book is also partially saved by the author's strong command of the English language. Her words have a vague poetry that makes complete and utter boredom almost enjoyable."
2,Incredibly tedious,"This may be the most boring book I have ever read. I was prepared to make certain allowances, knowing that it was the last book of a long series I have not read. However, that does not excuse the lack of any interest/conflict/plot line, the long digressions on the part of the author, the overwhelming number of in-jokes among the characters, and the sheer tediousness of the entire story. At least 3 characters are famous largely for their inability to carry on a coherent conversation, which is incredibly annoying to the reader. I would recommend that the anglophile reader instead concentrate on Barbara Pym, PG Wodehouse, Nancy Mitford, or Rosamund Pilcher."
3,Nice but too tight,"I liked this one but it was too tight around the bust area. I needed to use an extender for comfort. Other than that, it fit great and looked great."
5,Breezies bra,I ordered the breezies solid support bra after I had orded three other Breezies bra's. I like the other styles better for every day use. I found this bra gives great support when I'm exercising.It gives great support but is built up higher in the front so I cannot wear anything even a little bite low cute with it.I love Breezies bra's and have decided out of all the bra's I have tried Breezies are the best fit for me and I order a size 46C.
5,You wont be dissapointed.,"I have several of these flashlights and there is no way to describe the light output you just have to see it. It truly is as bright as a 5 D cell light. This is a perfect light for the car bedside or purse. I wear one on my belt when I am out at night. The light is bright enough to blind anyone temporarily that might be looking to do you harm. The aluminum body could be used in self-defense if you find yourself in a bad situation. If you choke on the price you might consider the same size in the polymer body it is a bit less expensive. However, you are truly getting what you pay for. This is not a flashlight you would loan to a friend because you will truly never see it again."
1,Nice light but short bulb life.,"The original bulb did not last as long as the batteries. Replacement bulbs are ridiculously overpriced, and do not last any longer. When surefire sells you one of these, they have guaranteed themselves an income stream for life.This a great light for showing off, but unreliable and expensive to actually use. It also eats batteries, but I knew that going in.I have gone back to my Streamlight Stinger, as have all Surefire owners where I work. The Stinger is reliable and economical to operate. I work nights."
3,"Good, but I was hoping for better.","It was ok. There are some songs that take me back to ""Sound Factory"" and ""Carbon"" and give me that nostalgic feel but the versions of those songs on this CD are lackluster at best. Not bad but not great."
3,OK CD.,"I would say I am satisfied. The CD didn't blow me away but it wasn't terrible either. I bought it solely for the second song ""You Don't Even Know Me"". I absolutely love that song. The other songs are OK, nothing to write home about. So it gets an average of three stars."
4,Nashville,"After I saw the film, I immediately had to buy the soundtrack. The actors wrote their own songs for the movie (with the exception of Timothy Brown, it seems, whose ""Bluebird"" was written by Ronee Blakley). This is about as unpretentious as country music can get. Occasionally it borders on satire.The best songs are those by Ronee Blakley (including the one performed by Timothy Brown) and is worth buying for those alone, but there are a few other great ones as well, including Karen Black's ""Memphis"" and Keith Carradine's Oscar winning ""I'm Easy"". Buy this album and then buy Ronee Blakley's albums, especially ""Welcome""."
4,"Oh, so fun","This is one of the greatest films Altman made, as well as possibly being one of the most American movies ever made. Therefore, what a relief to finally see the soundtrack available on CD. I suspect that this is a remastering of the original vinyl soundtrack which explains the absence of some of the songs. (The Gwen Welles songs were so terrible, but in a good, kitschy way... why aren't they here?) But the songs that are on here go from the deliberately hokey (Henry Gibson), to quite touching (Ronee Blakely...) And it's always fun listening to Karen Black try (and fail) to reach the low notes in her song ""Memphis"" (which I find myself humming all the time despite myself). But the crowning glory is ""I'm Easy"" by Carradine, and Barbara Harris' exuberant, ""It Don't Worry Me"" which ends this album on a high. Much more than a time capsule, if you're a fan of the movie, this is a soundtrack you'll want to have."
5,Yes!,"Finally, the soundtrack to my favorite movie is on CD! Besides the beautiful Oscar-winning ""I'm Easy"" by Keith Carradine, this collection includes the two songs written and sung by Karen Black in the film, as well as all the songs by the great Ronee Blakely. My only only problem with this CD is that a couple of tunes are missing (couldn't they have put them in as extra tracks?) Still, I'll take what I can get and look forward to the movie's release on DVD."
5,"I usually don't like C&W, but this is different. . . .","I'll never forget the first time I saw this film in the 70's--my first exposure to Altman, a rare exposure to C&W music. Wow! I still have the vinyl album, and when it came out in CD I snatched it up. Oddly, Keith Carradine's ""I'm easy,"" which won an Academy Award, is nowhere to be found in any of the legal music download sites, and I haven't found Ronee Blakely either. Her ""Dues"" and ""My Idaho Home"" are great! Another classic is ""It Don't Worry Me."" Rent the movie--you'll want this CD after you see it for sure."
3,Wyden's Bay of Pigs,"A detailed account of the Bay of Pigs landing derived from the author's interview with Fidel Castro and various U.S. government officials. The author goes into detailed explanations for the fiasco: From the Bay of Pigs CIA planner Richard Bissell's explanation of basically lacking control of the air to smaller mistakes, such as the reluctance to place anti-aircraft guns on the invasion ships. The interviews with Castro reveals his planning and expectations of the landing and his concern for been assassinated. There is hardly any reference to the imprisonment of the Cuban exiles for two years and the efforts to get them released. Mainly for that reason I prefer Haynes Johnson's account of the Bay of Pigs"
3,3 Stars is pushing it!,"I love Julia Quinn but this was not her best work... The beginning started out okay, but Victoria turns into Miss. Independent and it goes down hill from there. I mean I understand she wants her life but...a wealthy, handsome, and charming earl (to be marquess)or a life as a person who has to work for a living, and alone? Hmmm I know what I would do...And Robert is amazing but a little over the top, he needed to just let her go to see if she followed."
2,Disappointing from Quinn,"I love the Bridgerton and Whistledown books but this novel about lovers torn apart by misunderstanding didn't work for me. I thought that the things that drove them apart when they meet again 7 years later were not realistic and the hero didn't seem very understanding about the heroine's objections, basically just wearing her down instead of getting her point the first time she tried to explain it. His actions didn't seem so much like a lover as like a stalker."
2,A Prolonged Hostility -- 2.5 Stars.,"With this work, Julia Quinn has tumbled into the writers' pond of thinking -- that the swells of conflict are the keys to remarkable reading. Ah yes, every romance reader's dream is to drag through three hundred pages filled with down and dirty quarreling all in the name of love.Even with dry wit sprinkled throughout, the author's words are long and drawn. In this Quinn book, we find two people, who are the ages of 31 and 24, and they go at each other to the extreme.Victoria is the nastiest. This little shrew is supposed to be a vicar's daughter. I guess she missed the lesson on forgiveness. On the other hand, Robert was absent the day his governess taught Life's Lesson 101-- ""Believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see"".For more delightful reading check out Quinn's ""The Duke and I"" and/or ""An Offer from a Gentleman"" both are fun.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."
2,"Good, but not great","Nope, didn't like this one very much either. The lovers were just too impetuous and unbelievably annoying. I usually never stop reading a book, but this one. . .well I just couldn't finish it. Didn't do anything for me."
3,"Everything, but the Moon","This book, while lovely, is not very mind compelling. It is one of those book that you read swiftly without much thought process. Robert, the hero, seems perfect without a fault, while Sara, though lovely and amusing, is not very intelligent. The story in itself does not have much of a plot and seems to be going around in circles. For those who want a romance that will keep you on your toes, unfortunely this is not the book for you. For those, however, who want a romance to relax and read, this is quite good."
3,hard to empathize,"I started w/ Quinn's newest book (an offer from a gentleman) and am working backwards through all her books. The newer books are definitely better written. Everything and the moon does have the witty dialogues but it tries too hard.Some parts were too sappy and the characters weren't too developed. Probably cuz they had already found love in the beginning, and therefore are nice loving people, unlike the cynical rakes and supposedly un-interesting ladies one usually has. The plot moved along too quickly and it was hard to believe the lovers had become cynical of love."
1,Disappointing,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! There are some of Julia Quinn's books that are wonderful, but this one is not one of them. The writing, the dialogue and the storyline is pathetic. She has so many excellent books it is hard to believe she wrote this one!"
2,Just not worth the time,"You could tell immediately that this was an early effort of Quinn's and frankly, I am surprised it was published. It was that bad. The plot was too simple and she did not have the experience required to extend it into a full length novel. Boring, boring, boring. I never imagined I would tire of hearing a hero say ""I Love You"", but I definitely did as the over-worked phrase was repeated way too many times for it to carry the importance you associate with the words. None of the spirited, funny trademark dialog that we have come to expect from Quinn. Stay away from this one unless you just have nothing else to do."
3,Disappointing given her other books,"I thought this was a pointless book. I couldn't empathize with the heroine, even though I understood intellectually what her issue was. There was no real emotional development; instead the book was filled up with repetitious, empty, fairly whiney dialog. I LOVED the last J Quinn book I read - this was a great disappointment. Skip it and try another one of her novels..."
2,A real disappointment...,"I hate to be the fly in the ointment but I cannot agree with the 5 star ratings the previous reviewers gave Everything and the Moon. I recently read Quinn's How to Marry a Marquis and I was enchanted! The book was light but very very very funny with cute believable characters. This one however, started out very well but became a strain about midway. I didn't care for the new independent, unmovable Victoria. Even though Robert had the patience of a saint, near the end I thought he should have just dumped her. She was too much work. I mean- there's angry and defiant and then there's obtuse! Anyway, I'll still try more Julia Quinn because I liked the Marquis one so much. If you like humorous regency novels, try Merely Married by Patricia Coughlin and Escapade by Kasey Michaels."
3,"not bad, but not amazing either","I just finshed reading all of Julia Quinn's novels, this one being the last one I read. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either. Don't get me wrong, I think there's no bad Julia Quinn book, it's just that some are so great that others pale by comparison. This is one of them.All the character's were likable and it was endearing to see characters from other novels mentioned (like the Duke of Ashbourne and Emma from ""Splendid""). There were also a few moments that had me cracking up, like the dress shop incident. Still, I found Victoria to be irritating at times and I thought that the love-hate banter between Victoria and Robert was dragged out.I'm giving this novel 3 stars because there are other Julia Quinn books that are so much better. However, if you're a Julia Quinn addict you should read it, just so you can appreciate her recent work even more."
5,A Must-Read!!!,"I have always loved Julia Quinn's books but this is one of my favorites. If you love to read light and funny romances, this is the one for you! I caught myself laughing out loud while reading this book and I still go back to my favorite parts and reread them. This book is not to be missed!"
5,I loved re-discovering America with Charles Kuralt!,"After reading this book, I felt a sense of renewal and satisfaction that there are still candles lending their beams to the world. I picked up this book for a report at school. I thought that it would be just another boring book that we are often forced to read in school. Wrong-O! I loved it! From the team that had lost every single one of its games to the train depot that served soldiers during WWII, I found myself emersed in each of the stories. Each of these average Americans had a not so average story to tell..."
4,Alternative Viewpoints,"I heartily recommend this interesting book, which presents a refreshingly different perspective. As for the reviewer promoting Jim Schnabel's 'Round in Circles' as a solution to the mystery, it would be foolish indeed to jump to the conclusion that a known CIA agent is going to present the public with unadorned facts, given that government disinformation on this subject, media manipulation, and the 'Firm's role in it, is already well documented."
2,Bleat a dead horse (sic),"Excuse me, but didn't Carl Sagan (in his book 'The Demon Haunted World"") nicely summarize the whole, entire and complete ""Crop Circle Phenomenon"" as the decade-long genesis of two self-confessed and confirmed English pranksters which is still perpetrated by copy-cats to this day? I mean, this whole subject has been done to death. I guess rational news travels slowly when minds are thirsty for credulity."
3,leaves you wanting more....,"Skip James is wonderfully quirky in his interpretation of delta blues. These recordings comprise his entire output before the delta blues revivial in the early 60's, and as such, are priceless as a musical document. Too bad that the recording they obtained have deteriorated so badly. I have heard better versions on other collections. The piano work was cool, though."
2,Too much surface noise,Since this cd was made from old 78s there is alot of surface noise that makes it hard to appreciate the excellent music.Sure it has historical value but the later 60s recordings on Vanguard are just as good if not better musically.With todays audio systems the noise is enhanced.Music 5 stars audio 1 star.Buy at your own risk.
5,True Blues man,"Skip James is definitely one of the most influential classic bluesmen out there. If you have or have not heard his stuff, do yourself a favor. Get this cd. Great songs with that great old timey sound. Skip is one of the best in my book. I own around 25 pre 1940 blues recordings... and this is one of the best."
5,Blues/Skip James,"Had all these numbers on records-getting a CD comp with all the 30's material is great-sound is better on this than it was on my records...amazingly great acoustic blues. Highly recommended if you are into Robert Johnson, Bukka White and Son House...or if you're into blues period."
3,Not that great,"It was alright, but nothing special. Truthfully, I just got it because it was on clearance sale. I didn't love the smell, but it wasn't bad either. Just... meh."
5,A Fascinating Exploration of Alternative Healing,"Beautifully written this book takes you on Connie's personal journey through many kinds of alternative healing. I couldn't put the book down, finding myself smiling with pleasure at each new discovery and revelation. Most important it opened me up to try those therapies I had never experienced.An excellent read.Diana Cooper"
5,The Skeptics Guide to The Adventures of Life,"Wow....What a great book that is long overdue. Connie has shared her personal experiences and findings for the betterment of mankind. This book was such an easy read with great insights to alternative methods of healing beyond the realms of traditional medicine. The last time I was as excited about a book was when I read ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" years ago.This is a great book to guide people into opening up themselves and seeking a variety of ways to heal their mind, body, and spirit. It's also a great resource book with contacts for reliable practitioners and healers.The whole time I was reading this book I felt as if I knew Connie. She captured my attention throughout the whole book. I have been telling everyone I talk to how great the book is and they have to read it....."
2,Expected more,Purchased this Kindle book prior to a Vermont vacation. I actually used it very little. I found the pamphlets and maps that we picked up on the trip were much more helpful.
3,Fairly good - Useful,"I bought this for my trip to Vermont and read it for the most part. It provided useful information for the most part. However, I did find that a few things were hyped up somewhat. Apart from that, this guide was useful to plan my visit to Vermont. I did find that the authors recommendation of restaurants were in the high end price ranges and were not really useful for me since I was looking for something more in the medium range. And some local favorites such as ""Pie in the sky"" in Stowe were not provided the coverage they deserved. This restaurant was moderately priced and had the best homemade italian food that I have ever had in the U.S. Apart from this, I would definitely recommend this as a worthwhile purchase since it clearly identifies scenic routes, local attractions, side roads etc."
1,No continues !?1?!?!?!?,"At first this game player seems great, until you find out that it will NOT let you use continues on any of the games!!! That's right, you will rarely see past the 1st level of any game. It makes a decent paper-weight...."
2,Totally Confused,"Nambé 11-inch Wine SlingWe ordered two (2) as Christmas gifts for a couple of daughters. By the time Amazon got done we had recieved four (4) and been over charged for the duplicate order. The return service only credited us the product cost. I will not order from Amazon again. Respectfully, Richard C. Smith"
4,Good not to sweet cookie,This cookie is not sweet like most oatmeal cookies. It is a very heavy dense cookie not chewy or bendable.Overall taste is good if you can live without the sweetness of normal cookies.
2,Strong!,The taste of these one is particularly strong. I did not really like them but my friend did. If you don't mind and can handle the strong taste then I say buy them.
5,See Ya!!,"I disagree with the other reviewers, If you read the directions it will work. I have tried many many products (traps, pellets, worms, etc) none have worked to my liking. Traps will work but with kids and dogs I like to steer clear of them. Not to mention killing the mole and disposing of it.This is a repellant, its not designed to kill them.As for the spray itself-When hooking this up to your hose it lasts quite a while. I have a small city lot 1/4 acre and this lasted 5 applications. I do a couple treatments per year spring and fall.I also have 2 dogs and this doesn't affect them in anyway which is a huge plus.For best results I would apply it to a moist lawn, I learned this is a more affective approach and the product will soak into the ground a lot quicker."
5,5 stars!,A look into the mind of David Finch as he does his stuff is amazing. He's top of his game. An Excellent dvd & a must for all artist aspiring & pros. I'm an artist too so & learnt alot from some of the techniques but I won't go into detail. A must is what I can say. 5 stars!
1,Trashy and offensive,"I found the little I read of this book predjudice, trashy, and offensive. No dignified female should read this book. It is called a feminist book, but what I have read of it actully disgraces females. Don't waste your time or money on this book!"
1,Cheap.,"I bought this to mount a monitor to my hot shoe. First, no matter how tight you turn the screw, the ball slowly leans forward. My monitor is light, like very light, and it cannot seem to support it. Find something else."
2,Must have a bad one.,I must have a bad mount after reading all of the reviews. I'm using this to hold a small LCD monitor on my DSLR and I could not get the Ball tight enough. The Set screw in the bottom is useless in keeping it from spinning.
2,Horrible Design,"I have no idea why people gave this thing good reviews, I can only guess they are use to crap gear so they thought this was solid. It uses one single tension screw on the side to secure the top pivot ball meanwhile putting tension on the lower thread slot for your shoe or to go onto a Pico dolly or something. Very difficult to detach quickly from either end without loosing the ball tension so while your thinking u will remove the shoe u have to worry about the camera now wiggling on the top ball. Its basically cheap thin aluminum on the inside with plastic all around it. Very disappointed in Marshall."
5,Works for me,I bought a few of these to mount my (Haier HLT71 7-Inch Handheld LCD TV) to my camcorders. They work great and allows me to rotate and angle the monitors in every direction without issue.
2,VERY LOOSE FOR MY T2I,"it doesn't stay on the hot shoe of my t2i, its very very loose, i dont know if i got the wrong part or a dif version but it does not work on my t2i, its also not identical to the picture here, any sugestions?"
2,Regret for Sucrets,"These are so strong with throat numbing ingredients that all the other benefits are quickly overlooked. Hey, oral surgeons: forget anesthesia, just use these suckers. So strong that I had to question: ""Is this normal? Will I be able to talk later on coherently? Am I drooling?"". Metal box is a plus for hiding small trinkets."
5,So strong it's craaaazy,I tried one of these on a lark and it felt like a dentist had numbed my mouth. Crazy numb and effective.
5,Trash classic,"After all these years of suffering with bad vhs tapes, we finally have the uncut version of this ""trash masterpiece"" no pun intended. Great fxs and awesome camera work make for a disgusting tale of wine that melts the homeless."
5,"Great sleazy,cheezy,gory dark comedy horror","This movie is king of 80s cheese in my opinion.The special effects are really great ecspeically considering the low budget,you can tell they put a lot of effort into filming this. I love the colors they used it adds a really grimey feeling. I have Frankenhooker and Basketcase and really enjoyed them as well.If you have seen these movies and liked them you'll have to see Street Trash as well. Next I'm getting Brain Damage also directed by Frank Henenlotter."
3,strange movie,"This is a very strange movie. Excellant picture quality, the dvd is very well produced. Crazy movie about crazy street people. Not strong on plot, but a lot of bizarre effects."
3,not sure what to make of this...,"it's good, but weird. at times, Street Trash can be funny, dumb, colorful, dingy, political, exploitative, linear, and chaotic.i wish the coolest bits could have been amped up and the lame parts dialed down. as it is, i think Street Trash is worth seeing if you like strange little films about violent, horny bums and toxic liquor.ia ia,Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
5,HOW DID THIS MOVIE GET PAST TROMA?!?!?!?!,"From beginning to end this movie had Troma written all over it- the melting, the bad acting, the music, the penis football game; it was perfect! I have seen alot of crazy movies in my time but this was highly original and well worth the watch. It starts out with a good foot chase scene and then gets to the first melt victim, the following half hour or so was a little slow but the last half hour more than made up for ANY shortcomings. I found myself at the end wishing for just one more melt scene and when it didn't happen I just watched the movie again ( I'm a glutton for punishment!). The last song was horribly done by the lone mobster in the movie, but was a great finishing touch to this cult classic. I LOVED IT !!!!!!"
1,Can't Believe I bought this,"Folks, if you haven't bought this movie or even seen this movie yet, do not, I repeat, do not waste your time. The movie was more of a comedy than it was horror, and the use of paint for ""melting bodies"" was atrocious. I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage. The title of the movie fits it well, at least the ""trash"" part does. Don't purchase this movie if you value your hard-earned dollar. You were warned. I can't believe that out of 33 reviews, this movie only got two negative reviews. That just goes to show that our culture will watch anything and call it entertainment. Wow, some people are so easily satisfied when it comes to visual and plot entertainment. Not me... I wouldn't have even given this one-star if it hadn't been required in order to post a critique. This movie was worse than awful."
1,"Trash is right, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","Street Trash is by far one of the WORST movies Iv'e ever seen next to Natural Born Killers,House of the Dead,and Batman and Robin. A cheap-priced ale turns homeless people into a muck of slime. I thought this movie was going to rock but instead it sucked wasting some decent special effects for a film made in 1987 and the budget it had. Street Trash is boring and badly made and the acting is terrible(since when do fillmmakers think clowns can act?) and the direction is disjointed. Please folks do NOT watch this piece of TRASH and rent the better 1989 fillm SLIME CITY,instead."
4,So silly and stupid that it's great.,"This movie is so silly and stupid that it's great. It goes beyond all boundaries and comes up far short of being PC. It's been label the goriest movie ever made. That title belongs to others, but this movie ranks up there. It's actually one of the sickiest movies ever made, and I love it. PUT IT ON DVD ALREADY. Another movie on my wish list. A must own."
4,Street Trash Treat,"I saw this movie at the New Zealand ""Incredibly Strange Film Festival"" a few years ago and it was my my favorite of the Festival. It has some great scenes and I bet the crew had fun with the paint charts picking the colours for the melting people. Fully recommend it to all B grade aficionados."
5,Gore Feast Stench!!!,"Man not a Bad ""B"" movie at all, i love low budget gore films like this and all the bums and what they are up to make the movie move along nicely..This DVD also comes with 2 cool stickers that you can make your own bottle of viper then label it under the name viper..I did...anyways theres this moment during this film when you think Hey! what happened to the plot then the story picks right back up with a super speacial effect ending two thumbs up fot street trash!! Street Trash alliance.."
2,Humor that time has largely left behind,"It is unfortunate that it is generally true that the humor that appeared in Mad Magazine the 1960's has not aged well. It was generally incredibly stupid, used a minimalist approach in the images and the language was squeaky clean. The two primary characters in these stories are Fester and Karbunkle, one an unshaven small guy and the other rather large and dimwitted. Most of their actions can be described as extreme slapstick, such as large and heavy objects being dropped on their head.Since I lived through this humor the first time, I have a predilection to enjoy it that more modern people will lack. Yet, I did not find it funny, at best I would consider it slightly amusing. Tastes in humor change over time and in many ways the changes have passed this book by."
5,Without Question -- A Classic,"The author is one of the most interesting European mystics to have appeared. This book contains excellent translations of the short generally two line poems he wrote while in - if not a fully Enlightened state - at least something close. Here is one poem I like very much: ""Because through death alone we become liberated, I say it is the best of all the things created."" Not everyone's cuppa' tea but for those who want to feed their inner mystic -- dinner is served..."
4,"Silesius: German mystic and poet, authro of protestant hymns","This man was a doctor and good friend of Abraham Von Franckenberg and was of ambivalent loyalties to catholic church during the counter reformation.An orphan himself, he was later the benefactor of orphans and lived a cloistered life while writing his specialty,rhymed alexandrine couplets.. he is said to have been the first author of most of the protestant hymns"
5,Awesome series,"I absolutly love this series and I've read a lot of books. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's the young adult version of Radiers of the Lost Ark, with a female hero! Something that's not very popular in these HarryPotter-esque days. I love this book and I'm sure you will too."
4,Buffy replacement,Move over Buffy here comes Jenna. I like the story. Fun and exciting. I can't wait to see Simon and Jenna really hook up. Simon is worth drooling over. I'd like to see more magic as the series continues. If they put it on t.v. it could actually give us something to watch when Charmed is done. Keep them coming.
4,"Good coverage, good tint, light-weight","Good safety sunglasses. Comfortable. The tint is dark enough to be used as sunglasses. On the light-weight to heavy-duty-feeling scale, they are on the light-weight side.. The ""frame"" is a molded part of the lenses...not a separate frame."
2,some good time but not enough,"While Novikov did present some good and interesting info on the nature of time, there was not enough. If you are interested in Navikov's personal life in science or some of the history of Russian science, there is much of that here. If you are only interested in the nature of time discussions there is way too much irrelevant material. Yet still the time ideas are worth the struggle through the rest."
4,Fine disc in a fine series.,"This series of ten discs (of which this is the ninth) has been consistently enjoyable, without being compulsive. There is lovely music here, - Pachelbel couldn't have written an un-musical note if he had tried to - but nothing which approaches the F minor chaconne or the aria sebaldina (on earlier discs) in terms of quality. The recording is lovely, though we do get a lot of organ ""air"", and music rarely comes out of silence, so at first hearing you may think you're getting tape hiss (dont worry, you'll soon adjust). More significantly as a criticism (though I certainly dont profess to be an organ expert), I find the organ itself just a bit too grainy, - too french as another amazon reviewer has put it, - and would have preferred a slightly more metallic - or is that more germanic? - baroque organ. Notwithstanding those criticisms, a pleasantly rewarding listen, - but get the earlier volume with the Chaconne first."
4,I'll have to re-read this,"I'll have to re-read this because I was reading it on the Kindle, and because the novel is written in several voices, it was sometimes difficult to keep track of who was doing what to whom! I wished I had a paper copy so I could more easily flip back and forth among the pages.Interesting plotline, a bit Gothic, a bit romantic, a bit British aristocracy going to the dogs. Good read."
4,"Book has ""stayed with me"" for 2 years","This book has a sorrowful character that carries throughtout the whole book. Poignant, thought provoking describe the book. Don't read this book if you are ""down"". This one will stay with you."
4,Slow but clever,"This was my first Goddard mystery, and frankly, if it had moved any slower it would have lost me. Readers looking for action should look elsewhere. The prose is pleasant but tends to be wordy. But there's a reward for sticking with it. The reward is a good four star tale well told. However, be forewarned, the number of twists invented by Goddard along the way may cause the reader to anticipate the ending. Afterwards, you are left to wonder how so many boring people could get into so much trouble."
4,Engrossing!,"It was poignant reading this book the week of Remembrance. While I have read many books about WWI, I never cease to be affected when I read another. This book is very well written. It has that soft, English quality with depictions of stately manor homes, weather, proper English gentlemen. But it also uncovers the seedy underside that is so often depicted about Victorian-Edwardian England: perversion, abuse, dishonor. This tale though has some very unusual twists to it and every time I thought I had figured the whole story out, it took yet another one.I have read one other Goddard and this is by far his best!"
5,Improve Your Judgment,"Charlie Walbridge has done an excellent job of looking at past whitewater accidents and helping us all learn from them.This book helps you improve your WW judgment without actually having the near-misses and accidents you would normally need to get smarter and more worldly.Every parent of a paddler ought to buy their kid this book, but you might not want to actually read it yourself because then you might think paddling is more dangerous than it actually is."
3,Jennifer Y los Kumbia Kings,"It's almost like Jennifer is guesting on a KK album, they are on it so much. Oh well, the music is decent but nothing spectacular. The english songs are pretty bad, too dancy. Which is the problem with the whole thing. Jennifer is no longer a Tejano singer, now she is a dance artist.The album is not that bad though. It gets better after a few listens. Jennifer could do a good dance album if she wanted to, it's just that A.B. is not that great a producer/ writer. Now that she's not with Q productions anymore maybe she'll get producers and writers who can do her talent justice."
4,Sexy and fun,Let's face it Jennifer isn't the greatest singer around. She is now trying to do both pop and English. Both kind of fail but it's still a good try. Her music is catchy and fun. She is improving and I'm sure one day she'll be great. Buy this for the inside picture. I swear it almost borders on Porn. Definitly worth the price of a CD.
5,brilliant,well worth the wait .good quality .buy it enjoy. i am from the uk. amazon service excellent was delivered in 6 days.
5,Where's Season 2?,"I never got to see this show since it was run while I was out of the country and had no syndication action in my area (unlike the Jetsons and Flintstones). I finally got a chance to watch it when Boomerang started running it in the wee hours. Amazing how good this show is - it's able to keep up with the times without looking like a normal Hanna-Barbera show.I do hope they put out season 2 since that has the great guest appearances by Don Knotts, Monty Hall, Jonathon Winters and Rich Little."
1,People call it classic because it's old and they vaguely remember it,"This show was not funny when it was new. I was there. I remember. The animation is crude, the jokes aren't funny, but worst of all, the laugh track is intrusive.There was a remixed version of this back in the day with the same soundtrack but with lions instead of people. I'm not making this up. It wasn't good either."
3,Wait till your father gets home,"This DVD brought me back to the 70's! The horrible animation, the tepid dialogue, and lackluster jokes, ALL just I had remembered them. Tom Bosely was the only name I remember, bu,t this series REALLY is the grandAddy of late nite/primetime animation. See where Family Guy, Simpsons, and South Park all started. Pretty low priced to boot, it's a must for hardcore animation DVD collectors."
4,Great speaker for little cash,I got these for my plow truck.. i listen to mostly rock and i was really impressed with them. There not stompers but for 25 bucks shipped for two pairs you can not beat these!! the highs sound great and the lows are pretty good as well.. since my speakers are in my doors im not expecting much for bass responce... good buy!! came fast too!!!
4,Good car speaker for the price,"Got this to replace the factory paper cone one-way speakers in the door of my Mazda MX-5. Much nicer and clearer sound. Other than the connector, no modification was necessary; straight drop-in, the existing water shield fit over it."
1,Disappointing but...,"I really enjoyed the arrangements...they seemed fresh, lush, and vibrant. The choir was delightful to listen to but Sammy's voice just doesn't pull through. That vibrato and color of her voice isn't very becoming and quite frankly it's almost insidious. I'd rather listen to the choir."
3,Says it's not for fabric,"I don't know how well this blade works because although the description says it's for fabric or paper, the packaging says it's for paper only. Since I wouldn't be able to return it if I'd opened it, I decided not to take the chance. The description was wrong and it really should be fixed."
1,does not cut fabric,"I feel cheated, mislead, & lied to. I read the product description. I read the product reviews. Both claim that this rotary blade is intended to work on fabric. Yet when I recieved the blade, the packaging said ""for paper only."" Several reviewers even said it work well on fabric despite the packaging claims. I don't know what fabric they used it on, but it couldn't cleanly cut through cotton. I tried to cut a pretty scalloped edge onto a fat quarter, like you'd find at all fabric stores. While the blade did indeed separate the fabric into smaller pieces, it took at least three passes. The finished edge was not scalloped but tiny, fraying squares. This product DOES NOT WORK ON FABRIC. Please fix your description."
4,small scallop blade,"I was looking for a little bigger scallop design and this one is a smaller scallop so if you are looking for a smaller scallop this one is perfect. Works well, just wish the scallop was a little larger."
5,Fiskars 45 mm Rotary Scallop Blade,"This blade works well on fabric, even though the packaging from the manufacturer states this blade is intended for cutting paper. Your item description states this is for fabric, paper and many other uses. Fortunately the blade does cut fabric resulting in a clean beautiful scallop finish. This purchase seems to be exactly what I was looking for after all."
3,"Great subject matter, could be better written",Victor Smith was a young man with an adventurous spirit when he flew across uncharted areas of Africa in the early 1930's. Today he would be calles irresponsible but he helped pioneer todays airline routes.
4,Enjoyable read,"Wow. The reviews before mine were pretty harsh. They really picked this book apart. Seems they took personal offense that the book was set in the UP, and they weren't happy with the author's take on their area and their lives. Born and raised in Chicago, I enjoyed this book. Maybe that's the difference. I didn't read it and pick every little thing apart. The first few pages really got my attention, and the story was slow moving, but gradually built to a satisfying conclusion. I disagree that the characters were shallow or underdeveloped. I thought both Warren and Norman were quite well developed, just not very likable. But that's what made the story interesting! I say pick up a used copy and check it out for yourself. Give it a chance."
4,Its warm coat time,"Cold is a fine book, that should be enjoyed for what it is, a phychological/mystery. Set in the rugged Upper Pennisula of Michigan in the dead of winter, the story unfolds in such a riveting manner that you will have a very hard time in putting it down. The story and the cold will stay with you for awhile after you finish reading it."
2,What trailer park do these people live in?,"A classic story of a blossoming relationship playing out against an old lover's triangle. I found the relationship between the sheriff and Liesel to be much more interesting than the two brothers fighting over an underachieving woman like two little children fight over a toy. Unfortunately, the book focuses more on the trailer-park antics of drunken, drug using convict brothers rather than the sheriff and his new found romance.I believe Mr. Smolens could really write a good descriptive story if he didn't have to pepper it with four letter words and sleazy situations. I'm not clear as to whether this is his own idea or something his publishers believe will sell books. In either case, this tactic sold one book, but will not sell any more to me."
3,Out in the cold,"One of the positive attributes of this book is its accessibiltiy. Smolens's book was written for the unsophisticated reader, with a plot that is a mite predictable, though I won't give it away. The characters are somewhat one dimensional, and the book tricks us by intriguing us at the beginning with an interesting point of view character, but then we realize the novel--like so many contemporary novels--shifts point of view between chapters. Is it too difficult these days to sustain one perspective? One gets the feeling that Smolens has a little man on his shoulder saying, ""This will make a good TV movie."" The little man on Smolens's other shoulder says, ""So What."" But if you're looking for a read that is simple and entertaining, COLD will fit the bill."
4,BRR it's cold Eh.,"Certainly has the feel of the winter that can enhance our state at times.Exspecially the upper. I enjoyed this page turner and read it very quickly. The characters were expanded well I have known people with those attitudes and ways, all and all I think his understanding of a climate, the people that live there, and the good and bad that lives in the heart of man were expressed well in the book. This is my first by Mr. Smolens,it will not be my last."
4,Dark,"I purchased this book because it is set in Michigan. I thought it could be interesting. I was thrilled, disappointed, scarred, excited and felt like I needed another blanket! If you like things all wrapped up in pretty packages, this is not the book for you. I found the characters complex, interesting and the plot turned and twisted. I really did enjoy it."
3,Cold,"Good exposure to real cold country, particularly to someone from a tropical region. Well written, slow start but good development to a relatively exciting finish."
2,Cold,I really could not find a story here. The characters in the book just seemed to drift in and out. I could not finish the book.
5,excellent!,"i loved this book, good writing. great characters. I dont get the negative reviews and i would highly recommend, i didn't pay for this book but i would have willingly paid full price."
4,Gripping,I thought the book was very good. I had a hard time putting it down. I will definitely look for more books this author has to offer.
5,"A literary gripper, hard to put down","I have always loved a good story. John Smolens can tell one -- in aces. A few years ago I discovered his 2001 book, ""Cold"", a novel set in the frozen winter fastness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and peopled with characters so real you would swear you had met them before. It was the kind of story that grabbed you on page one, sucked you into the vortex of its white-out blizzard setting, and finally deposited you breathless and gasping on the final page, wishing there were more. You came to know his characters, but you wanted to know more. It wasn't that the story was incomplete. Quite the opposite. ""Cold"" is a perfect gem of the writing craft. Even its secondary and minor characters come alive as real and recognizable flesh-and-blood people. I hope he brings the principals back in a sequel one day. - Tim Bazzett, author of Love, War & Polio[...]"
4,Excellent blend of Techno-facts and fiction,"""Death by Fire"" breathes new life into the Techno-Political-Thriller genre which found itself starving for a good ""enemy"" after the end of the Cold War. Chris Davis has pinpoints THE new threat to U.S. National Security in the 21st Century: America's own vulnerable reliance on Information Technology. Using the (still) current geo-political situation with Iraq's Saddam Hussien as a catalyst, Davis builds a very convincing and entertaining plot centered on the U.S. Defense establishment loosing complete control of its Command, Control, and Communications through little more than a renegade computer specialist and an expert terrorist. Fast paced, a bit abrupt, but very effective."
2,Unrealistic Read,"Overall, I can't say this book was that terrible, however because it was somewhere in the 300s page wise, I was easily burned out on finishing it. I have noticed that good teaching books get the point across in a little over 100 pages, this one repeats itself so much that I was ready to stab myself in the eye after the 3rd chapter. This is one of those ""pefect world"" books that makes you question when the last time the authors were in the classroom. It seems to center around mostly secondary situations. The authors tell stories about great classrooms but never explain how to achieve them, or they talk about strategies that everyone does as if it was something they thought up themselves yesterday. My main quesion for them, how do you expect teachers to know how to teach this way? Most secondary ed students take barely any methods courses and mostly just subject area courses, they teach the way there were taught.... taking notes."
4,not bad,"Works pretty decent. There is no on/off button like a Logitech device, but just follow the instructions included in the package and the deice is ready to go! I use this device to do voice over for animations and it works just fine for me. For the price, not bad at all!"
4,Bulova Watch,"I was happy to receive my watch in a very timely manner. For the most part I was very pleased with my purchase. I was a bit disappointed the diamonds didn't show up a little better, but over-all it is a keeper."
1,Poor heart rate,"I am very disapointed in this product. It will only take my heart rate if I am not moving at all and if my hands are completely dry. Now, what's the point. I'm a runner and sweat profusely; it refuses to give me a heart rate as I'm cooling down, walking, or standing still trying to get a heart rate. I do not recommend the watch. I'm unfortunately using it only for timing my runs. It was a disapointing purchase of $60 or so."
2,Performances marred by shoddy mastering / EQ. A technical failure.,"I knew something was amiss after ripping this to mp3 realizing it sounded EVEN WORSE, sounding way more degraded than the quality loss you'd expect from cd to mp3 transfer. If the decision to release these songs with poor sound quality was DELIBERATE then she's doubly failed; there is no added ""warmth"" or ""ambience"". This is a tragedy, because Orton has talent but it doesn't come through as I'd hoped on this album. I yawned several times during playback, it just isn't very good. These cuts would work better as throwaway, ""alternate takes"" or ""rarities"" - but as a bona fide career release? What she should have done is dump this production set and handed it over to William Orbit, who not only would have made these tracks infinitely more listenable, but you would actually HEAR them with proper EQ and mastering."
2,Listenable but obviously without any major songs,"This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my ""go-to"" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood, at any time. This CD has some well-written songs, but there are only two songs (the first, ""Worms"", and ""Heartlandtruckstop"") that burst out of the speakers the way Beth Orton songs can. The rest are all absolutely listenable but none of the songs has that ""I must replay this song now"" moment.I am used to Beth's songs possessing many random moments of beauty, that are partly caused by the spareness of production. This CD all the songs sound pleasntly even on the EQ band, but they mostly lack the punchy lyrics or compelling music that grabs you. For instance, I heard many of these songs over and over again on the radio, but none stood out the way ""Stolen Car"" did or ""Mt. Washington"" did.Get Daybreaker instead for your Beth Orton space in your record collection."
2,"""The Phantom Menace"" of Beth Orton albums","Enormous potential. A history of excellence. But something went terribly wrong in the execution. Maybe it's not as bad as the subject line would suggest but it's a huge disappointment nonetheless. Even has ""Worms"" as Jar-Jar. With the exception of the occasionally harmonica bit, the band just isn't terribly interesting. And a lot of the melodic aspects and tonal richness of Beth's singing are gone -- sometimes she just sounds like a squaking crow.I started listening to Beth after hearing her guest performances with the Chemical Brothers & really enjoyed her voice in that context, but with a conventional band (and production that ofter underemphasizes the vocals in favor of humdrum backup) it's just not that interesting. I've tried, really, playing this over and over, but it still disappoints."
3,Would be better if she went back to electronic songs,"I love Beth Orton but her songs were much more interesting when she collaborated with electronic producers like she did on her first disc. I wish she would work with the Chemical Brothers again. They made a great team!That being said, I like the first half of the disc much better than the second half. It gets a little depressing and boring towards the end of the disc. It is still better than most discs out there."
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...a sophomore slump for Beth's senior release. This is absent any life her previous albums exhibited.
4,(Heart) of Soul,"WOW. It's really special to feel like you're experiencing the evolution and growth of an artist along with them. Beth Orton is so stripped-down, uncovered and real (at all times, not just this CD) that I feel like I'm taking up space on this planet. As noted by earlier reviews, this CD takes a few listens to absorb into your system. But when it does, you are there. It's stripped down, earthy and even has a lit grit in - like it was just picked fresh from a garden. The songs individually are excellent, but fit together even better. Where to start? I'm not sure. Personal tastes are just that. I think I love each and every song in its own way. Special to me are Shadow of a Doubt, (Heart) of Soul, Heartland Truckstop, Shopping Trolley and A Place Aside. I just can't choose one. Thanks to Jim O'Rourke for helping bring out this new twist on Beth. It adds great flavor to the drink of life."
1,so very disappointing,"I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the ""other side of daybreak"". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden.We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics'."
1,No thanks.,A leading Americana music magazine whose opinions I usually agree with gave this CD great review. Sorry. It just doesn't resonate with me. Too much reliance on atmospheric percussion that bubbles just below the surface. No memorable melodies to latch on to. Sameness of material. Lack of all traces of humor.Throw in her very unpleasant voice and you have a CD destined for the resale bin....which is where mine ended up.
4,Rips just fine on a Mac,"I was able to rip/import/download/whatever both discs without incident under OS X. Transferred to and plays on my iPod, as well."
1,Hmmmmmmm,I'm sorry Beth but your voice gets on my nerves. Cheer up and stop whining. I have listened to 3 of your albums 3 times and tried to give you the benefit of the doubt. It's 3 strikes now and you are out of my collection and into a bottom drawer.
3,Bedboard,"The item was not as close to the mattress size as shown in the photo. Otherwise, it was all right."
4,Silent Words...Ibiza,"This song takes you to the depth of your soul. If the phat bass beat doesn't get your feet tapping, the screamingly smooth vocals will have you ascending to the highest avenues of trance bliss. I recomend this single to anyone who is a fan of Paul Oakenfold, or the sound of Perfecto Records. This is a definite addition to any trance lovers library."
3,More stress on Design than on Inventor,This can be a good book for whoever is looking to overview mechanical design (not in depth); Inventor is used as the software environment for the design concepts. An analogy may be teaching the essentials of a word processor to someone who is looking to be a writer.
5,Thumbs Up!,"This book provides a solid overview of Organizational Communication from a scholarly perspective. The authors do an excellenct job of identifying and elaborating on key issues, elaborating on related inquiry and elaborating on future considerations for the field."
3,adult learner,"This was the only text used in a recent Communication course. It is very very ""dry"", and difficult to get through in a 6 wk course. Good to keep on the shelf for Comm majors. Good luck if you are required to use it as I did! Yikes."
2,Didn't really like it,"I know this is considered one of the horror classics. It has been hailed as great by most that have read it. I found it slow and subtle. Just wasn't really what I was looking for. The house was certainly haunted, however the haunting did not seem particualarly frightening. It is considered good by many, so don't skip this one on my account. Just my opinion."
1,"Feeling ""Burnt"" by lame paranormal thriller","Annoyingly dumb story about a family who rents a suspiciously inexpensive mansion for the summer. They don't even start to move in till page 101, prior to which they've spent 100 pages talking about moving in, complaining about city life and digressing into irrelevant '70s horniness. After they finally settle in, the wife spends all her time cleaning and the husband and son sit around being boring. As Count Floyd would exclaim unconvincingly, ""It's so scary it'll...knock the socks...right off of your feet."" ~~~~ SPOILER AHEAD: ~~~~ Why does the house need to suck the souls of its inhabitants to restore itself to pristine condition? The renters are cleaning it anyway as part of the agreement. It seems like one call to Molly Maids could save everyone a lot of trouble and eternal damnation."
1,It'll bore you to tears.,"One of the lamest, if not, the lamest ""horror"" book I've ever read. And I've read alot.It's a dry read and it'll put you to sleep.I don't know what's worse, the book or the equally brain-dead movie.Skip it."
4,Good Product but with some complications,"I needed a pair of small but powerful speakers for my little '92 Geo Metro. I had installed a powerful Pioneer stereo/CD player but the small speakers were blown. I found these two advertised as used in ""Very Good Condition"" on Amazon. The price was real right, and they were shipped off in good time but the mail was slow and when they arrived one of the speakers had a bent frame and the woofer cone was detached for about 1.5 inches on the edge. The story has a good ending in that tweaking the frame and super gluing the cone worked and now the system sounds great for a little rattle trap car. 45 miles per gallon the the ride seem fine now with some good tunes! I'm a happy traveler."
1,Dead on Arrival,"The very obvious 'Made in China' sticker on each speaker gave me pause. One of the speakers had poor soldering where the wire leads from the input connector to the inside of the coil. The other speaker sounds pretty good but I can't tell w/o both of them functioning. For the price it was worth a shot, I suppose. I am of the mind that there is no excuse for something not working out of the box. It warns of quality issues across the board. My suggestion is that a buyer not get too excited about these speakers. Get 'em if you're really on a budget and willing to take the risk that they will fail."
4,Strange but interesting,The story was not quite what we expected. It started out slow but DID get more interesting and eventually captivating.
4,Very cute movie.,"I really liked this film, which can be watched with English subtitles and original Mandarin Chinese or With English language in the audio. If watching with the audio words in English, it is actually really good (as many films aren't).Suitable for children and adults, it portrays a boy who is always bullied and how an ""alien dog"" helps him overcome the bullies--is the dog real?/imaginary?--We never really find out which adds to the magic of the film.."
4,In a different light.,This is unlike his other movies but viewing it in the proper context makes it still o.k. After all it is highlighting the misery of poverty and prejudice. Parts of it made me cry but over all it made me laugh. Also its something the entire family can view together.
3,"Mandarin, not Cantonese",The version I received was a Taiwanese version dubbed in Mandarin and not in Cantonese. There are commentaries in Cantonese but the movie is dubbed in Mandarin.I like the movie but I wanted it in Cantonese.
3,Not Chow's best,I found this to be an entertaining movie but not one of Chow's best. There were many references to Kung Fu Hustle as well as Shaolin Soccer which were funny but overall the story was lacking. It's a fun movie but not the greatest. I'd say rent it.
2,Not what I expected,"I like Stephen Chow's work. Especially Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. (I have Kung Fu Hustle on DVD, Blu-Ray and UMD.)I pre-ordered this DVD without seeing it first. I wish I had seen the movie in the theater first. It is not what I expected. Yes, it is probably intended to be a ""family film."" That's perfectly fine. However, I cannot imagine sitting down and watching this with any young kids. Unless of course it's pouring raining outside and they just watched ""Bambi"" and ""Old Yeller"" back to back. That will prepare them for what is to come in this movie.There is some cute stuff in the movie. But there is also some content that might be difficult or emotional for some kids.The brief homages to Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and Mission: Impossible II were nice.I never would have bought this DVD if I had seen the movie first. I will definitely have to watch Stephen Chow's next movie before buying the DVD.You can buy this DVD, but keep tissues nearby while watching."
4,CJ7 is awesome...,"First off the negative reviews surrounding this title seem a little unfair. After reading them, I suspected that this film contained something completely awful. Such was not the case... though it does deal with themes that are a little mature I wouldn't say that this film is for the entire family and that is it's misconception. The film is geared more towards adolecents and adults more so than children. the film is quiky and what you would expect from Chow. but it's humor is somewhat dark at times. Either way, should you sit your 8 year old next to you and view the film? I would say it's probably not the best idea. but it is worth watching for yourself. CJ7 is quirky and sweet."
4,"Good for all, simple yet effective",Very well presented tale about a poor laborer and his child who'se livesare changed when they encounter a little alien. This movie could have gone both ways but with a experience director that wanted to make thisfilm we end up with a pretty good little movie...good for kids and adults.
5,Good quality for a good movie,"An excellent film, very little known, for the whole family and very entertaining. The price is very low and is an ideal opportunity to enjoy this product. I am Spanish and I bought it because I did not find anywhere else. Undoubtedly a +10 on this product"
5,awesome book - one of the best,"I first got exposure to the book through a microbio workshop from NIH, and then after I got to the shelf, the book's thickness scared me off -until now. As an undergrad persuing public health, I was finally exposed to the fact of such issues such as globalization, infectious diseases, poverty and hunger, etc etc in my classes this semester. This book serves not only as a review of microbio, but also covers political, social, and cultural dimensions of public health through a journalistic perspective. Its comprehensiveness and detective-mystery style grasped me the moment I opened it. I can't wait to attack Betrayal of Trust in the coming months."
2,Bringing Preaching to a Whole New Place,"To put it mildly, The Coming Plague very strongly resembles the pacesetter in a long distance track event. It starts strongly, and fades just as quickly. What starts out as a very interesting discussion of a number of virulent, and quite frightening diseases, lapses into a protracted lecture on the subject of Man Bad, Woman Good. What should have been an objective discussion of the threats facing humanity, devolves into one individuals biased take on the subjects of ecology, politics, and male bashing. I purchased this book in the hopes that it might more comprehensively discuss virology than The Hot Zone did. Rather, I was left with nothing more than a one sided take on the authors clearly liberal view of the world"
1,Entertaining But True?,I read this book about ten years ago. I remember being entertained. I don't remember a lot of details but one thing is clear. It didn't happen.This book presents a prediction of a medical apocalypse. That doesn't seem to have happened. Dose it?
1,"PESSIMISTIC,RIDICULOUS, OVERKILL","FROM THE VERY BEGINING THIS BOOK'S SOLE PURPOSE WAS MEANT TO SCARE. ONE STRANGE THING ABOUT HUMAN NATURE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE LOVE TO BE SCARED. THIS IS BECAUSE EACH TIME THEY ARE SCARED, THEY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE PLACE THEY ARE AT; BE IT A WELFARE RECIPIENT OR A MIDDLE CLASS CITIZEN. THIS BOOK PUTS ENOUGH FEAR INTO PEOPLE THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY ARE PUT INTO A COMFORT ZONE BECAUSE IN THEIR MINDS, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS DISEASE, THEY ARE NOT AS BAD OFF AS THEY COULD BE. THERE COMES A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND WHERE SUPERSTITION HAS TO BE CAST ASIDE. THE SO-CALLED ""END OF THE WORLD"" PSYCHOLOGY MUST SOMEDAY STOP. AS LONG AS THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS ON THE EARTH, THEY WILL CONTAIN, CURE, AND CONTROL THE DISEASES THAT CONFRONT HUMANKIND"
4,The Coming Plague,"This book is thoroughly researched and has fascinating history about diseases and the social forces that help them spread. However, it is somewhat burdened by the excessive detail surrounding HIV/AIDS. I preferred the shorter chapters about the hemorrhagic fevers and the adventures that medical researchers went through to identify them. I have been reading this for a couple months, and expect to finish it...one of these days."
5,An excellent analysis of emerging infectious diseases.,"Laurie Garrett has penned a striking compilation of just a few of the incredible number of infectious diseases that stand at the ready to strike down humankind the moment that we let our guard down. Earlier this century, medicine and science declared the infectious diseases beaten and abandoned work on them in favor of chronic conditions such as cancer. As a result, we now have the AIDS pandemic, hemmorhagic fever diseases throughout the world, etc. Ms. Garrett sounds a warning that can be understand and heeded by both the layman and the trained scientist. I credit her with my decision to pursue a career in public health."
3,We're screwed...,"The topic is interesting (and quite frightening) but, the way the book is presented is rather dull. There's a lot of redundancies in the early chapters dealing with outbreaks of various diseases. A lot of the middle section is about the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. This was interesting; I grew up during the 80's but was only vaguely aware of the whole AIDS issue at the time. Then we get into issues of climate change, drug-resistant microbes, and other reasons why we are setting ourselves up for the next global pandemic.Again, TCP was fairly interesting but somewhat of a struggle to get through becuase of the presentation. Read it anyway; it's worth the effort.Recommended."
4,Great insight into diseases after WWII.Slows down in middle,"As others have stated, real life is a lot more frightening than Hollywood. First chapters are great and read like a novel. Halfway through the book, chapters start giving too many facts per paragraph which tend to make the book boring and slow. Last couple of chapters make up for it with a great conclusion. Provides great insight into how human activity (and arrogance) have contributed to the emergence of diseases after WWII. It's scary how ordinary activities can be dangerous and irresponsible when confronted with diseases that threaten our own existence. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK if your care about human nature and the impact we, as a society, are having on the world around us, and how that world is fighting back with soldiers called: bacteria, viruses and parasites. After reading this book I'm not so sure who's going to win that war."
5,None,this is the most comprehensive and best researched and written book on infectious diseases I have ever read. I am a teacher with a masters in Ecology and was blown away by this book. I will be referencing it often.
4,"Worth a read, despite some over zealous conclusions","Laurie Garrett's _The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance_, is a _tour de force_ of infectious disease and popular epidemiology. Despite the occasionally overreaching, neo-apocalyptic conclusions Garrett reaches, _The Coming Plague is a must read for anyone interested in health, science, and our understanding of both.Compared, rightly, to Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ (Boston Globe), _The Coming Plague_ raises flags about the ability of science to grapple with the range of viral and bacteriological threats to human health. In the same way _Silent Spring_ alerted readers to the consequences of ignoring the impact of late-twentieth century civilisation on the natural world, _The Coming Plague_ cautions us to the ways old and new threats endanger human health.Readers should prepare themselves to spend some time with Garrett's text. It is a bit of a tome, and occasionally dry, but well worth persevering through."
4,good text on mathematical statistics,Paul Hoel taught statistics at UCLA for many years. This book was one of the best introductions to mathematical statistics for a first year graduate course. It was used as a text for that purpose at UCLA and many other statistics departments across the country. Several editions of the book were published to keep it up to date. Currently it is a little dated and there are many advances particularly in the area of resampling methods and other computer-intensive statistical procedures that are not covered.I think it is somewhat comparable to the combination of Erich Lehmann's books on hypothesis testing and the theory of estimation.
5,Statistical theory and application,"I used the fourth edition in a college course and found it to be well written and very understandable (the fourth edition was pre-calculator and had math tables in the back). The book assumed only an elementary calculus background and so was not rigorous in proving every theorem introduced, but was pretty good in showing the derivation of commonly used results and formulas.I particularly liked the problem sets which were a mix of theoretical and applied exercises (with answers to the odd numbers), and NOT a long list of statements to be proven.The emphasis was on theory, but statistical theory developed from attempts to solve real life problems and this book recognized that and considered applications of that theory throughout."
3,Encyclopeadia Britannica,I knew this book's name from Bibiography for an Encyclopeadia Britannica (1993 edition) article Statistics. I have not read the book yet. I gave it a neutral rating (3 stars) since I assume the book at least is not a poor one. (Very likely it deserv a 4 or 5 star rating after I read it).
5,My favorite olive oil,"Everyone's tastes are different. But this is my absolute favorite olive oil. It has complexity, and has this incredible long smooth finish. I pour it over heirloom tomatos, or grilled asparagus, or just dip good bread into it!"
2,A course in indecisiveness,"A Course in Phonology seemed to me to be a course in bad editing. The one thing that most kept this book from being helpful in the learning of phonology is that it never used the same terminology chapter to chapter. The terminology switches were just assumed by the author to be known by the reader. The glossary did not have entries for any of these terminology switches, in fact the glossary had precious few entries that gave definitions past its own root word. The second annoying thing about this book were the homework assignments at the end of each chapter. There was no answer key, and they spent an entire chapter discussing rules for English phonology, then decide to give French, Catalan, and some bizzare Micronesian language as the assignments all of which had different rules that were discussed in the chapter. The accompanying workbook also had it's problems among which was the missing answer key."
3,"Great quality, irritating book","Taking a class in phonology, and professor says this is a fantastic book. However, I think it treats the student like a baby. Too many questions after practically every paragraph just checking to see if the student understands. Drives me crazy! Very distracting. I guess the actual material is good? But the way it's presented is a horror."
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this along with a Palm book from the same company. This is a VANITY PRESS who puts out material from their professional association members without sufficient editorial controls. Their books are very low quality and are essentially useless. Try Prentice Hall or one of the other professional education publishers for higher quality material. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID.
1,"Three Strikes, Yer Out Sucker!","Buque maldito, El (1975) is the third blind dead feature. I suppose that people were wasting their hard earned cash in the 1970's visiting theaters to watch junk like this and that is why we got so many sequels to the squalor they call, ""Blind Dead"" films. This is purely a waste of time and good money. If you see this at a five and dime store, don't pick it up! It's awful and has no suspense what-so-ever. The boat is a silly model that is floating in a man's bathtub, if you can see a toe, that is a man. I can't believe people actually have the guts to call this filth ""brilliant""...truly a ludicrous and bold statement indeed!"
2,"Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Templars Life For Me","`The Ghost Galleon' released in '74 is writer/director Amando de Ossorio's third installment in the ""Blind Dead"" series. In my estimation this film holds the dubious distinction of being the worst of the four films. The action is excruciatingly slow, the women not as attractive and the storyline adds nothing to what has been done in the two previous films. Also bothersome was the idea of placing the slow-moving corpses about a ship, it just didn't work for me.Of course the genius about making sequels is the fact that you already have established an audience that will by the film whether they like it or not. Who wants something missing from the collection?"
1,BIKINI TEASER,"These are not zombies in the conventional brain eating head shot zombies sense. These are more like ghost zombies.Two bikini models with the aid of their agency opt to get stranded in a boat in an Atlantic shipping lane for a publicity stunt. Things start out well until they hit the fog and the ghost ship. The agency, along with another bikini model go on a rescue mission only to find the same ship.That is pretty much it. Note to self: If trying to escape quietly on a stone floor, remove heels.The acting and dialouge was pretty sad. There are better ghost ship movies out there, but no worse ones come to mind.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the version I watched. It does look like the camera cut suddenly when the models were undressing. I suspect there may be copies with some minor nudity."
5,Excellent Guide to Those Seeking Answers!,"Dr. Graham has produced and excellent for anyone looking for answers for life's challenges.In his consistently humble style, Graham addresses questions in the following areas:1. Relationships (mate, children, church).2. Spiritual Concerns (emptiness, purpose, God's Will).3. Psychological Problems (anger, guilt, worry, life after death).4. Ethical Issues (politics, right vs. wrong).5. Biblical Questions (God's existence, Jesus Second Coming).Read the book and be encouraged!Highly recommended!"
5,For beginning Vegans,I have been a vegetarian for many years and am an aspiring vegan. This is the first book I've read on becoming a vegan and found it informative and helpful. It describes the lifestyle choices by illustrating why it is important to become cruelty free and environmentally friendly. It also has a few nice recipes including one of my favorites - tofu eggless salad.
4,A Good Introduction to Vegan Living,"It's a good resource for anyone who might be considering becoming a vegan or has recently switched to a plant-based diet. The authors cover a lot of information, most of it good, some of it open to discussion. For example, there is text in the book on vaccinations that I disagree with, but I know some would not.I think it's written with the young, inexperienced cook in mind. Still, I found the information on vegan staples, hidden animal ingredients in food and beauty products, and the health benefits associated with a vegan diet all informative. The chapters are handy, the authors provide websites so the reader can find more information and products, and there are recipes (none of which I've tried yet) that look good.This book provides a broad overview of what it means to be a vegan and gave me plenty to think about. It would be very helpful for someone who has recently become a vegan, but it should not to be used as the only resource.[...]"
5,Informative book from a great vegan chef,"Good book. Great for starting vegans. The author has a website as well www.veganchef.com where she has a full cook books worth of recipes that you can use for free. Ms. Bennett is a huge asset to vegan culture whether you are christian, buddhist, athiest. agnostic, or hari krishna. She proves this through her book & website."
5,More than Denomination Blues,"Several collections of Gospel and Gospel Blues include Washington Phillips' Denomination Blues parts 1 and 2. Occassionaly one will see Jesus Is My Friend with its spoken poetic introduction. The album fills a useful function of filling out our knowledge of his repetoire - unfortunately ""complete"" is still only 16 tracks.Phillips' vocals are firmly in the blues tradition but his use of a dolceola - I've never heard or heard of it elsewhere - gives him a unique place in Gospel blues. However, if asked to choose a favorite track I'd have to answer ""all"".I highly recommend this quiet, laid back blues to anyone interested in blues or gospel."
5,A very interesting read!,"The title of this book may be very wordy, and that was something that grabbed my attention. I love to hear about strange animals and plants of our planet. Most people have no idea that things like Kinkajous and Capybaras exist. I have an Okapi plush doll, and most people I know say ""What's an Okapi?"" I think If you are interested in fascinating plants, animals, and insects, I suggest that you read this book. It's a great read, and will be good for generations to enjoy."
3,"Good sound quality, provided you have good mic-input","This is a decent quality microphone with above average sound. It sounded horrible at first, but it was due to the poor microphone input on the motherboard. After I tried an external sound blaster Extigy, the sound quality improved a lot.Background noise level is about average. I do have to crank up the mic input level to maximum on the extigy, and on windows volume control to get decent sound level.If you are using the build-in microphone input on your motherboard or a cheap sound card, the quality may suffer (ie, very low voice level, not clear at all)."
3,"Good for voice/net telephony, bad for serious stuff","This thing sounds ok as a voice recording mic and for transmitting speech over the net to other humans, but for things like speech recognition and anything where the computer itself may have to understand you, this thing is aweful. It does not do a good job at all of filtering out background noise. If you want a good speech recognition mic, go find yourself a decent headset that specializes in speech."
2,"Ok Sound quality, poor life","This mic lasted me only 10 months and I had bought it for $[a good price]. The sound quality is ok and you need to tune it through your audio wizard or sound can be very distorted. As someone else mentioned it was not a very good mic to use with speech recognition software but ok for conversations. Howerver, it just stopped working one day."
2,not pleased,I have to be so near to this mike for it to broadcast over my computer's speakers that my breathing is picked up as well as my voice.
3,Very graphic.......too much for me.,"I enjoy books that deal with psychics. I thought ""Eyes"" was very good, so I went in search of ""Blood"". I had trouble getting thru this one because it was so graphic and specific in places that it bothered me. The story was a good one, and I will look for other books by Glass, but I hope future books are not so graphic."
3,same same,"a good read altho not nearly as exciting as 'eyes', perhaps because it's so similar. i found this aspect quite disappointing - thruout the book had the feeling 'haven't i read this before?'.the title is certainly apt, there is a _lot_ of blood & guts which i thought was perhaps a little overly graphic.susan, david gold et al are developing into interesting characters as is michael. i just hope the author tries a different formula for the next book!"
4,Fantastic,"I couldn't put the novel Blood down and read it in one day! it was exciting, very gruesome at times but one of the best novels I have read in a long time. I would highly recommond it"
2,A strange product,"This disc is a combination of a latter-day concert performance at the Moon River Theatre in Branson, along with an album from very early in Mr. Williams' career. I found the first part interesting, but was not expecting a live recording, and was therefore a little disappointed. As to the second half, I am a big fan of most of Andy Williams' career, but I found these early songs a bit tedious. Also, the overall sound of the disc leaves much to be desired. I am no audiophile, but the strong bass quality of this recording annoys me. I would suggest paying a few dollars more and looking elsewhere for some good Andy. I wish I had."
3,Nice but could be more reliable.,"My daughter is really into birds & wanted a bird watching kit for her birthday. This item was perfect, however, one of the cards that it came with only 1/2 the bird songs work :/ (buttons on the right hand side). We had also used it and managed to get a couple of birds to answer back & come closer, a very neat item."
2,History of the Church -- easy on Medieval Info,"This was more a general history of the Christian Church than a general history as it purports to be. While I realize that the church was very important, the feudal system got only about three paragraphs of attention. Clothing, farming, diets, social structure weren't even touched on. I wanted more general information."
3,What is API rating?,"After I fill my car with this oil, I notice this higher milage Quaker State motor oil is not rated for any API service rating nor mantion ILSA GF rating. Why??? I can not find any info from there web side neither.I do not feel different with other regular oil, I purchased this oil because of saw this is pnly oil had the SLICK 50 added.But, I will like to know if this oil is comparable to API SM or ILSACGF-4? otherwise, I will stop use this oil again!!"
4,Gothic,"Truly enjoyed these shockingly repellent yet oddly inspiring tales. Quick question for anyone in the know. Is the editor of these stories related to Alfred Noyes, author of The Highwayman?"
4,Enjoyable,"I found this at the bottom of a box of books in the shed. As far as I can remember, I'd been given this as a gift many years back, so I sat down with the book recently to read through it properly. Some of the stories were quite enjoyable, like the haunted barn/hayride tale by Vivan Vande Velde, ""Morgan Roehmar's Boys"" which I would have loved to read as a full length novel. ""Stone Tower"" was beautifully written and kept me turning the pages rapidly to find out what tragedy had befallen Tara. ""Watch and Wake"" was creepy, Melanie's snarky voice resonated strongly in ""The Prank"", and I chuckled reading ""Have No Fear Crumpot is Here"", but others I found a little pointless and just didn't understand. On the whole, they were enjoyable."
3,EH.,"I didn't like most of the stories...They bored me after the first few pages so I skipped them.I liked 2 out of the 10 and could only stand to completely read 4 of them. If you're going to get this book, go to the library. It isn't worth your money...at least not to me. It wasn't scary or funny, it was weird (which I enjoy but not this time). Most of the stories went around in circles without ever really explaining the point or main idea.This wasn't a hard read besides the dullness but it did't add up to my expectations. I don't think I set them too high but the summary on the back made the book seem more interesting than it actually was.I let my friend borrow it and she didn't get past the first few pages beacause she didn't enjoy it (and she thought she would).Maybe you'll enjoy this book, but I sure didn't."
2,Long and boring,"This book consists of 10 different gothic stories. The stories are really long and tend to be on the boring side. I stopped reading after I read the first 7 stories. There is really nothing to be excited about in this book, nothing to look forward to read. It was long and really bored me to death. The stories are usually the ones that I couldn't relate to. It didn't scare me or anything, it just wasted my time for a while and that's pretty much it. Maybe that's what gothic should be!"
1,All about fundamentals about arranging popular music,"THE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGER COMPOSER book 1 by Russell Garcia contains it all. It's the definite guide for you, if you want to learn how to arrange popular music of all kinds. It does not matter if it was written in 1954, or whatever it was. You know something? You have to know the HISTORY. The music did not start today!"
1,This is an Abridged Version,"This is just an abridged version of her book, Overcoming Infertility Naturally, which I highly recommend."
2,Mostly unremarkable,"2 1/2Roughly a third of the material points at a unit going places special but overall the album still sounds of somewhat predictable, slightly credible, but mostly tired, late night, light-jazz, solo trumpet work."
2,True Confessions?,"The songwriting is okay for a first attempt at a solo album. Lost love and seperated lovers seem to be the overriding themes. Sounds like this cd is an attempt to work out personal problems, which is okay for a song or two, but would have preferred more variety in song topics. Del does wonderful harmonizing. His voice enriches the overall sound. Ronnie is coming along in terms of his own singing ability, but still had work to do. The accompaniments of Bela Fleck and Jerry Douglas gives the music more sophistication than the original band is capable of."
2,"Quirky, Offbeat,...Disappointing","I'd exhausted the recommendations of the local video specialist and was looking for that quirky original gem for a movie that would keep me entertained and be able to pass on to friends and family as a hot rental. As I was rather new to the Internet and this site I took to heart this movie when I read the prevoius reviews and figured this was the one.To say the least disappointing. The characters were quirky, offbeat and original but the movie plodded along at a rather pedestrian pace with little or no dynamics. To me it was a movie that was trying to be too odd, offbeat, etc. but tried too hard to be different to a fault. It certainly lost the attention of the spouse after the first 15 minutes, but I can't use her as a barometer to judge movies. Still it was like watching an un-popular guest at a party trying to overcompensate and instead coming off as un-popular AND desperate.I've definitely seen worse but I was hoping for more. A disappointing rent for $3.50."
4,Blood and Concrete,"Blood and Concrete is a way out comedy with some bad language, though used to add humor. The actors are all very good.Jennifer Beals sings a song & gives a good performance."
2,It needs... something.,"I first became interested in Rebecca Lynn Howard after hearing her single ""Out Here in the Water."" I loved its traditional yet innovative sound. However, upon purchasing the CD, I was disappointed to discover that the rest of the songs were pop-country, and not very original pop-country at that. The rest of the CD leaves much to be desired in this young artist, but I still can't get enough of ""Water""!"
5,This is not what I expected (It's more) ;),"When I bought the album, I didn't expect more than ""Out Here In The Water."" I was wrong. This album is truly a gem."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I thought that this album would be great because RLH writes, also. This is the worst album I have ever bought. The radio doesn't play her, and you have to shop online to get the CD because major stores like Walmart refuse to carry it. Yeah, some of the songs aren't bad, but she REALLY needs to just give them to someone who can sing!"
4,rebecca rocks,"This is a very strong 4-star album from Rebecca Lynn Howard. It's almost, but not quite, 5 stars. It fits in the country/pop genre, altho it's not too poppy, still recognizable as primarily country. Anyway, Rebecca, from Kentucky, has an excellent voice for country music and is a strong singer. Her voice moves easily through its considerable vocal range. The songs are enjoyable to listen to for the most part, tho a bit on the fluffy side. The ones I really enjoy are:Heartsounds - energetic kickoffOut Here on the Water - fun song about fun on the lakeWas It as Hard to Be Together - done by other people, I like Rebecca's the bestMove MeWhen My Dreams Come True - humorous, tongue-in-cheek songTennessee in My WindshieldIn summary, this is an energetic, fun, and optimistic album. Good one for the music fan's collection."
4,A true country songstress!,"With all these new younger country singers on the scene, thank God we have Rebecca Lynn Howard to show them all how it is really done. Now, sure, Rebecca is a little over 20, but she is still very young compared to the established Reba, Trisha, and Wynona. Rebecca's voice has strength and her song writing skills are great! These songs aren't all just about love either. Didn't think that was possible in country music anymore, did you? Well they are not. Her voice will take her further than her writing skills ever did, but not to say her writing skills are lacking. Many stars have done some her songs including fellow young country superstar Lila McCann. So, pick this one up if you like good country music, song with a certain twang!"
5,10 Star Album,"This album deserves 10 Stars! Rebecca Lynn gives all she has when she sings. You can feel her (literally) right through the music. She delivers w/ power and gets into the song. How in the hell could anyone give this album less than 5 stars? No, this isn't as good as the album ""Forgive""...but it's still damn good!"
4,great songwriter,"This artist is relatively new to me although she's been around a long time.Her songwriting is great; voice above average. Overall, great CD."
1,Sales MBB,"Poor choice on my part, not a book just a lengthy white paper that describes the same things found in a typical ""Sales 101"" community college text."
2,Barely raise your pulse rate,"Must agree with several comments here-- plot predictable, main characters flat and inconsistent, the menacing people are too easily stopped, the differences the two lovers have too easily glossed over. One woman's coming out jitters are smoothed out in 3 pages while the issues around an abusive ex seems to scarcely affect her emotionally at all... c'mon! The bird subplot was specious. No real use made of the setting-- New Orleans for heavens sake cries out to be more of a focus for an erotic novel if any place does! I envision seductionas with baguettes and gumbo. You know it's not that engrossing when you wonder more about how two cameo characters from a bar got together than whether the two main characters will be able to live ""happily ever after""."
1,Get this from the library instead of purchasing it.,"I found this book to be a dry, disjointed portrayal of lesbian romance set against the backdrop of a farfetched mystery. The characters are shallow, and the lack of depth of emotion does not allow the reader to become involved in the book. The reader cannot identify with the characters because she knows next to nothing about their backgrounds or who they are as people. The plot needs to be more focused and better planned, because it appears ridiculously unbelievable. Overall, it's the story of two lesbians who meet, have a lot of sex, say they're in love, and whose lives are somewhat affected by poorly constructed outside circumstances."
1,disappointing,"was this book like written because ms.ennis had to fulfill a contractual obligation? one of the most disjointed books i have ever read, and i swear that i read the same subplot in a different book by different author. i take no pleasure in panning this book, but it was bad."
5,Wonderful and romantic book,"I just finished reading this wonderful book and i really enjoyed it. I thought the characters were well portrayed, the story was romantic, sexy, funny and seductive. My boyfriend is in the process of reading it now and so far he's really enjoying it. The book is well written and the content is wonderful, I highly recommend it."
1,Avoid,The first time I used it the handle popped out of the cylinder. The base of the handle is threaded so I figured I'd just screw it back in. That seemed reasonable enough but after getting partway through inflating an exercise ball it just seemed to be going nowhere (sucking wind?) Again the handle pops out. That's about the limit of my tolerance for something this simple. I wasn't particularly harsh on the unit but the threads at the base of the handle just don't seem to be strong enough to hold the plunger inside.
2,Not great.,We ended up having to sew it in place. The glue was inadequate to the task. We will look for a different solution the next time around.
2,disappointed,It would have been nice to know that the actual color they show in the picture is not what you will receive. If you need a tan canvas DO NOT order this product! It comes in a grey color which is very disappointing! And the window mesh is a tan color. Had to use it because i didn't have time to return it and order a different one from another seller. All of the stores that carry this canvas has the same grey color. Thanks a lot!
4,"""Theoretical Neuroscience"" Dry but Informative","""Theoretical Neuroscience"" is an in-depth introduction to modeling of neural systems from the chemical/electrical processes within neurons, up through small networks of neurons. It is a little dry, but provides a wealth of information on modeling the electrophysical and computational properties of neurons."
1,They broke after the first fall,Pros:Look good...Contras:Bad quality glass...Broke after the first fall (lasted 6 weeks)
4,"NOT GREAT, BUT BETTER THAN 99% OF TPB'S","IRRESPONSIBLE is another solid outing for Brian Michael Bendis writing duties on ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN. Mark Bagley again handles the art chores and this tag team can pretty much create the best Spidey stories on the market with little effort.Volume 7 reprints six issues of the title and weeves its way through stories involving Peter and Mary Jane's relationship, Spidey's search for a new costume, mutants and the Ultimate X-Men, and an indepth view of Aunt May's character. The action and pacing for the stories is fine but the final chapter that really gives Bendis' Aunt May a turn in the spotlight borders on what a great story-teller he can be.Any new fans to Spider-Man comics can do a lot worse than starting with Ultimate Spider-Man: Irresponsible. And if it lacks the superhero action that you require then I strongly recommend Ultimate Spider-Man Volumes 2 and 4."
5,One of the best board books EVER!,"I am so impressed by all the books in this series/line! My 18-month-old daughter loves them, and I even enjoy looking at them. There is almost always something I didn't notice the last time, and we both enjoy looking at all the things that are going on in every single picture.Even the way the books are shaped is neat: the one about pirates is shaped like a pirate ship. The one about the old woman's shoe is shaped like a shoe. And so on. And the pages are some of the thickest I've ever seen in a board book, so I know they're going to last a long time if they stay dry!I highly recommend any/all of the Charles Reasoner board books to other parents. They are utterly enjoyable as well as being very sturdy."
5,Noah's Ark,"Visually captivating. This is a 9 1/2 "" X 9 1/2"" Board Book that is very well illustrated. My one year old grandson loves finding all the pairs of animals. Each page has a window or porthole that peeks at the next page. Very colorful Only 4 rhyming lines per 2 pages. Total 12 pages. Hidden humor - example, one of the snakes is being stepped on by a hippo. Just right for a preschooler, but delightful for grandma too."
1,Sexist!,"Although this book has lots of good features, they are negated by the sexist depiction of ""Mrs. Noah."" There are only six double-page spreads in the book, and one is devoted to making the point that it is ""Mrs. Noah"" that does the cleaning. If cleaning up after the animals had to be mentioned at all, showing everyone pitching in to help would have been a much healthier image for young children, especially girls. I'd return the book if I still had the order form. I wouldn't even donate this to a church. There are good Christian alternatives out there."
3,Interesting plot & twists,"The main characters were exciting people. Keith Heinman, the nut, really kept the story alive for me. He was constantly on the edge, his disguises, lies, & deception were the main theme of this book. The killers, congo virus & aids were scary but a side issue. Harpo was the funny background hero which I liked, I would have liked him to play more of a part. The secret love affair between Dr. Crane and the CEO Elliott Halsey was fun. Halsey's reaction to his son seemed normal because he was gay and had aids. I really enjoyed their forgiving each other and beginning a long dead relationship. There are lots twists and plots to this little Medical thriller. I think the deadly virus thing is way over worked any more, that part just didn't keep my interest. It is an average book and good reading. It moves fairly fast. Why not give it a try, your intersts may be different than mine."
2,Maybe the first time,"Perhaps Doug's jokes were hilarious and witty at first, but seeing them recirculated throughout the film as well as on stage, and shows after the film came out, illustrates this guy's limits on comedy. George Carlin was a great stoner, uh, I mean comedian, but it was an active participation in the humor. Benson seems to miss this point in his haze of repetitive marijuana jokes. Either put down the bong and write better material or start smoking/vaping some better stuff to increase your creativity. As for now Doug, you're boring! You lost me, I didn't lose you, Doug!"
2,Super High Me,"This movie was mediocre to say the least. I love the idea of someone trying to get high for 30 days and making a scientific experiment out of it but I think Doug should have just stuck with that. The truth is, he's not really that funny; his comedy acts, which was 75% of the movie, was the worste part. If I were making this movie I would have focused much more on the science. I did think that the movie was informative in a way and I must give Doug some credit for being creative enough to think about testing his psychosis abilities before and after he was high. Overall though, I would only recommend this movie to people who are truely interested in marijuana and I would also say to try at all costs to rent it because you probably won't want to watch it more than once."
5,"420 Nation, Recommendation","It's funny, informative, and it's about Marijuana... I've learned more aspects of Marijuana in this movie, than my experience of using Marijuana."
3,funny movie,this movie was ok. i thought it would be more informative like super size me was. but it was mostly his stand up comedy. this was pretty funny but i was expecting more.
3,interesting and funny,"Overall it was interesting and funny. It had some slow moments and spent too much time on California's prop 215. Doug Benson looks the same stone as he does sober, and his jokes didn't suffer when he wasn't high. It's worth an hour and half of your time to for a few good laughs."
2,Not what i expected,"Ignore the writing on the cover that says this is up there in the ranks of Cheech & Chong ... this doesnt compare.... it's a documentary about a comedian who doesn't smoke pot for 30 days, then smokes pot for the next 30 days.... but I couldn't really see any point to this other then promoting the comedian, and a political stance against the DEA.It has a few funny jokes, but not enough for me to think it was nothing but a political argument documentary."
2,Mostly Dull. Educational Segments and Protests are its Highlight,"What's wrong with Super High Me? In a nutshell, Doug Benson. He's dull and boring on stage (although I'm sure his audience, floating over the clouds of the influence, may disagree), his jokes are dull and tired, and the documentary plods along like a crippled mule.Unlike Supersize Me, the host isn't photogenic or interesting to watch.I enjoyed the advocacy for individual liberty and the history of marijuana, but the remainder of the film doesn't justify purchasing this film. A very valid point is raised when a federal officer raids a dealer with an unsigned warrant. In summary, however, I'd rather read about it or rip my fingernails off than sit through Dull Doug's quasi-Demented Trip through Marijuanaland."
3,I was expecting it to be funnier....,I love DB and was really excited for this movie. It was a little bit of a letdown :(
2,A let down,"Doug Benson is a funny comedian but I didn't find him to be very funny in this movie. I think he got stoned beyond the point of being funny most of the 30 days he was high. Most of the content about legislation was common knowledge so I didn't learn anything knew. The most interesting part to me was the closing of legal, medical cannabis stores in California due to discrepancies between federal and state laws regarding marijuana. In the movie they show cannabis stores in California being shut down by the DEA (federal officials) despite the state law which has legalizing it. It was very shocking to see stores get closed down at random and have their patient records as well as their supply of marijuana confiscated and never returned even after they were legally allowed to reopen. It really shows the holes in the legal system of the U.S. Other than that, I think the concept of the movie had a lot of potential but was neither funny nor informative for the most part."
2,Pretty stupid,"Full disclosure - I don't smoke pot, but I was totally drunk when I watched this movie. My review is basically that this movie is completely pointless. Doug Benson is a funny comedian, whether he is high or not. The highlights of the movie were his stand-up comedy routines. Otherwise, this movie had nothing to say. Makes me a little irritated that I wasted my time. This movie does nothing to debunk the theory that potheads are lazy and stupid. This movie was pretty lazy and stupid."
1,Super High Me DVD,Never received DVD. Did not respond to my second email informing them of the situation. Will not buy from them again.
1,What a waste of time.,"I got asleep watching this video. Very boring, not well done. Misleading. The main character at the end is totally wasted and he just says that everything is OK, no problem, he shows that he just could not drive or operate machinery, but his body is OK, just the they forgot that his eyes, and his soul are totally crippled."
4,Good vest,"It is a bit more Med size, not small. Good vest. Has one inside pocket. Just like picture, no sleeves."
5,Great Re-Edits and extended mixes,My only complaint is that some of his Re-edits are good but not long enough. I want to hear 13 minute remixes and stuff. Other than that its a great addition to any Salsoul or Disco collector.
3,My textbook purchase,A little surprised by what i got since the picture amazon supplied for the isbn code I used was what I wanted but not what i got. I received an older version which was still useful so I'm not sure why the picture was wrong. Need a way to verify the pictures to the isbn code for all products.
3,"very tiny, not as nice as presented by the photo",The charm is very flat and not as nice as presented in the photo on amazon.
4,Another great product from AT CROSS,"I have owned CROSS pens for years, and was intrigued by the unique design and use of materials for this pen. The feel of leather is comfortable in your hand, and the size and thickness of the pen works well. I wouldn't use the pen for long handwritten letters, but when you need a small pen handy that fits in your pant or shirt pocket for jotting down quick notes, this is a great pen to own. The twisting action works smoothly and flawlessly as expected from AT CROSS products. I purchased the Toffee Colored Pen for a considerable discount from amazon.com. I do not think the $45-$50 price tag is reasonable (thus the four stars), so watch for discounts. All in all, the AUTOCROSS PEN is another great product from AT CROSS."
3,"cute pen, but expensive for what you get","If you are looking for a small,thick pen this Cross fits the bill.I think the chrome trim looks a little cheap. The pen writes nice and fits in my hand well. I do not think it is a good value. The best pen for he money is the Namiki pilot, although the Namiki is a standard length, standard thickness pen.Update - seems to run out of ink fast. Maybe this is to be expected since it is a small pen"
4,Real Basic for Dummies,"This book was the most up to date version of Real Basic information I have found. It was very helpful to me, but lacked enough specific examples to make it frustrating."
3,A bit discouraging ...,"When the sample code in the introductory chapter has a typo, you wonder about the rest of the samples and the book's editing. I can imagine a lot of newbies, the book's intended audience, getting unneccesarily confused when through no fault of their own they can't get their first project to work."
2,Not worth it.,"The reason the call this book ""for dummies"" is you have to be a moron to buy it. It teaches you just enough to the basics to almost give you an idea of programming, but not enough to really use it for anything. So if you already program, it is a frustrating review that goes nowhere. And if you wanted to learn, you almost did. Also the strongest point of RealBASIC is the ability to cross compile. It mensions very little about how to create a program to run on dual platforms and shows no real examples of how this can be done. Oh, and it *CAN* be done :D Wait for a good book and spend the cash. A sad death for many a tree..."
1,spare thyself,"Since 1990 I have used a Mac. My first computer dates from the 70's. This is the worst `Mac' programming book to which I have been exposed in terms of typos and other clerical errors.My copy of the book came with a physically fractured CD. When I informed Hungry Minds of this I was informed by an impatient, sarcastic and insolent woman whose accent was of the nature generally associated with inebriates that the sole manner by which the disk could have been broken was by my intentional destruction of it....[note: it was still in its plastic sleeve.If you wish OOP get a Hewlett Packard 48G calculator.It just is not worth it, IMHO, to inflict problems on oneself secondary to typos or Neanderthalic people on the phone when Neuburg puts out a dandy book on this very topic which, I dissent with a former reviewer, does not take a higher then normal I.Q. to understand although not for the intellectually challenged."
3,Very basic book (pun intended),"I did not like the book. However I still give it three stars, it is exactly what it was reported to be. I had programmed in BASIC many years earlier, so I found the book to be very much below the level I was looking for. If you are an experianced C/C++ programmer with a little knowlege of BASIC, then I would recommend ""REALBasic: the difinitive guide"" (O'Reilly). However, if REALBasic is your first programming experiance, then this may be the book for you."
3,It's a little discouraging,"When the code for the first project in the book has typos, you wonder about the rest of the code samples and the book's overall editing. I can imagine many newbies -- the book's intended audience -- being unnecessarily confused and aggravated when their first project fails to work. One hopes a new edition comes out with cleaner copy."
2,Got wrong product,"While the clear glass globe arrived intact, it was the wrong globe. When I contacted their customer service, I was told that I could return it but at my expense which was more than the globe was worth. Somehow, the original number I ordered, which was taken right from the globe itself, got subbed for this one which isn't even close"
2,Tutuorial?,"I read the first review and purchased the book. I do not think that this book is very helpful for a novice nor an Intermediate user. I was extremely surprised with the lack of quality and fundamentals in the book. The book is assuming a lot and has numerous problems with location of the information and the extremely poor quality screen shots. It is very difficult to follow and understand. It almost seems like it was written by a person not knows the information, but can't teach it. If you like a wordy book, with mistakes and extremely poor quality screen shots, this is the book for you. If not, shop around for another book."
3,could be better,"Songs like MATTER OF TRUST, and ALLENTOWN.......would be much better then INNOCENT MAN and SCANDIVIAN SKIES. REALLY, those picks are much better. STILL A GOOD but deserves to be BETTER hits album.WHY is this album an IMPORT ??? You wouild think an AMERICAN single hits CD would BE MADE ( By now ). Like the other reviewer said. I agree....go AMERICAN ...BILLY JOEL."
4,Scandinavian Skies?,"Looking over the track listing, we have all the Joel classics here... ""Piano Man""... ""Just The Way You Are""... ""We Didn't Start The Fire""... ""She's Got A Way"" and of course, ""Scandinavian Skies"". Huh? Don't remember that one? Dig out your copy of Nylon Curtain. If you're putting together the Joel staples on one CD, I highly doubt that sits on top of the pile of essential songs. But aside from the obvious choices that could go in place of ""Scandinavian Skies"", it has a nice selection of songs for the casual listener. But of course, the casual listener would be better off dropping the extra money for the Greatest Hits 1-3 Box. Overall, 4 stars on the weight of the songs included, not on the ones they didn't."
1,Because it is a 17--$ version of an album you can pay 10for,Let me help you out- the music and the man-Fantastic! nevermind the movie. All of this material is available on the Avalon blues 1928 complete okeh recordings for 9.98 or so. And it is in excellent sound quality. Best you can ask for to be honest. Forget this overpriced set of the same music.
5,Honest and fascinating,"I read this when I first became interested in Buddhism and found it inspiring. On reflection, it is obvious that van der Wetering is a writer at heart, and he forges something like a story from his struggles and experiences. Having, in a less serious way, also gone on retreat in Asia (Thailand in my case) I recognise the sense of confusion trying to come to terms with truth in an alien culture. It seems to me that this book is inspiring because it does not attempt to hide that confusion and ambiguity. The sequel, A Glimpse of Nothingness, is also worth a read if you like this."
4,The Empty Mirror,"'The Empty Mirror' is a short but fascinating look at life in a Zen monastery from the point of view of a western novice. You follow as he goes though his induction, his first tentative steps in Zen Buddhism and the struggles he goes through in finding his path. It is easy to read and has a nice touch of humour that draws you in and helps you connect with what he is portraying. It could've gone into more detail in some parts and it ended a touch abruptly, but for the time I was reading it I was completely engrossed and enjoyed every minute in it's pages. If Zen Buddhism interests you then this is a good place to go for a fascinating insight into monastery life in Japan.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Read for class,"I had to read this for class. Not great literature, one may even say that it is bad. It is more of a diary about Zen buddism. I would bet that there are better books out there about Zen that are better."
2,Dean & some other guys.,"The ""Jan & Dean"" recordings on this CD are NOT the original hit recordings as you would hear them on the radio. They are poor re-recorded versions. Furthermore, I honestly don't think that Jan Berry is singing on any of these recordings. I know that Jan does still make recordings (despite his paralysis and brain damage), but I don't hear his voice anywhere on these recordings. If anything, he's singing WAY in the backround. It does sound like Dean is singing on these songs, along with some other singers. But it's not the same without Jan. Jan's the lead guy. Even in Jan & Dean's prime, Dean was usually just a backround singer who hit the falsetto notes. Sometimes he didn't sing on the hits at all, as with ""Surf City"" (Brian Wilson and 2 other guys sang backup)."
3,The Turtles and Faux Jan & Dean - Back 2 Back,"This CD is marketed as a back to back alternating mix of the greatest hits of 2 separate 60's headline rock groups - The Turtles and Jan & Dean. A strange nostalgia album, huh? I have to admit, I enjoy listening to it, but . . .But what you get is a series of 10 songs which alternate consecutively between the sublime original 60's cuts of The Turtles (using the best studio techniques available at the time), and then some band calling themselves Jan & Dean that sound like a Ramada Inn cocktail lounge duo with a Conn organ and a set of bongos. I have to agree with the other reviewer . . . I think we're getting Dean and some guy with a bag over his head that says his name is Jan (in his muted voice).But still, it's fun listening to ""Little Old Lady from Pasadena"" done even by this garage band. And The Turtles rendition of Dylan's ""It Ain't Me Babe"" is alone worth the bargain bin low price of this CD."
3,Disappointed,"I have all of John's music, and I felt he was just getting better. The variation of his tracks mixed with the flow of the instruments creates the originality I expect form his music. When I listened to this CD, I thought I was hearing Carlos Nakai. Not because that was bad, but unexpected! What happened to the moving spirits dancing with the flow of each note? I guess when you are spoiled by greatness, anything shy of that is a disappointment."
3,Adequate for Beginners,"I found this dictionary to be useful up until the time I began an intermediate level language class in the Netherlands. It wasn't quite comprehensive enough, even for in-class assignments. My biggest complaint with it: many of the definitions given in the Dutch to English section were unfortunately not present from English to Dutch, making it great for looking up Dutch words that you don't know, but it left me frustrated when searching for the Dutch equivalent of many English words and phrases. That being said, I think that it is more than adequate to use as a pocket dictionary or for quick references. I use it when I read Dutch newspapers and novels. If you want to go for something with more in-depth definitions, invest in one of the Van Dale dictionaries. Their hefty price is well worth it."
5,Perfect,Has been difficult to find a good Dutch dictionary and this one is great for someone who writes and speaks Dutch
1,A starter's guide only.,"I was after a book on business leadership with serious analysis of what works backed up by case examples - this is NOT it.This is a good book for new leaders - it tells all the things that can go wrong and how you can work your way through the maze of other people and other agendas.Its definitely not a new ""Make It Happen"" (John Harvey Jones) which is what I wanted and expected.It is heaps of sociology and everyday examples, not a guide to the insights that make people follow you through those long entrepreneurial days and nights of hard work, near zero pay and share options in the distant future. Leadership where constant danger lurks rather than ""nice"" ways to get people to come along with you.Sorry but it is a nice book for nice leaders."
1,The Single Greatest Literary Work of Our Time? Joke,<smirk>The Single Greatest Literary Work of Our Time?At least the authors should try to look a little impartial when reviewing their own work.I guess after Harvard's ethical flexibility re: Jack Welch - this kind of thing is tolertated.
1,Very Bad Advice,"This is one of the worst attempts at writing a book I have ever seen, let alone writing one on getting a job in the game industry. Several people I know have used the advise from this book: one got fired outright; another ended up getting sued by his boss; a third is now an alcoholic."
2,Battery didn't work!!!!,I cannot believe that I have a watch with a battery without load... I had to buy a new battery.
2,trite and dull,"While the characters are charming, the plot is over the top. What really bugged me was the writing, especially the constant referal to the lovers as 'friends'. Not to mention the never ending 'honey' and 'sweetie'. The overdone plot would be forgiveable if the writing were not so agravating. I did read this out of sequence, so I may have been more appreciative of the characters if I'd read them in order, but regardless the writing is annoying."
5,"Another Winner, to be sure","Carrie has done it again with Hope's Path. Not every story can sustain a sequel. Carrie has proven that the story of Lex and Amanda can, does and always will because those of us who read Destiny's Crossing will never tire of the tale.This is well written, entirely believable and moving. I could not put it down and hurried to find the next sequel almost before turning the final page of this one.Carrie, my friend, all I can say is you have another winner, to be sure."
5,I want more,"This was a great sequel to Faith's and Destiny's Crossing. It was fun to see how Amanda and Lex handle living together. Their love is amazing, even under times when they are attacked by someone trying to break up their love. I seriously can't wait for the next one. I want them to start having kids. This is a great book. Carrie Carr does a great job with these characters and I hope there are many books to come. You should definitely read this book."
1,boring and ridiculous,"This book is horrible. The characters' relationship is not developed enough. There's too much focus on work, the ranch, and minor characters. There's not enough interaction between Lex and Amanda, the two main characters. Every time something exciting is about to happen in the story, there's some type of sudden interruption. Martha, one of the characters, almost always interrupts the special moments that are shared between Lex and Amanda. This is very annoying. This story is supposed to be about a powerful lesbian relationship, not about how many times Lex and Amanda's special moments can be interrupted by another character."
3,Myth of Quetzalcoatl,"I found the text occasionally tedious and a little repetative. The progress of the tradition of Quetzalcoatl from its ancient roots at Teotihuacan and Tula to the historic Aztec period and from one part of Central America to another was very interesting, but the information was often presented in a repetative way. It was almost as though the work had started originally as a series of journal articles or research papers presented at conferences on Mesoamerican mythology all woven together to produce a book length product. The chapter on comparative literature and the evolution of creation myths in different cultures world wide was certainly interesting, but not necessarily original or even germaine to the title subject."
1,Poor quality,Very disappointed in this DVD. Poor color throughout the whole DVD. Wish I could return for a different copy. Kirkland and Barishnikov are wonderful and I had a different DVD (lost) that was brilliant in every way.
2,Too much Baryshnikov,Too many face and body close-ups of Baryshnikov. Prefer the older version where children were shown more often and M.B. less.
3,"Buy it for the memories, not the quality.","I have to say, I am not the type that usually notices the technical details of a DVD. However, I can say with certainty that this DVD looks like a bootleg VHS tape. It is sad, because this was on my must see list every year growing up, and while I amglad to have a copy, I think it looked cleaner and sounded louder when they used show it on PBS. I hope an anniversary comes around and they give it the remastering that it deserves."
1,Poor video and sound quality ruin great ballet,"According to the box, this production of the Nutacracker by the Kiev ballet is ""exquisitely danced by the Kiev Ballet Company"". Unfortuneately you can't tell much about the dancing because the video quality is extremely poor - easily the worst commercial video I have ever seen, the music is highly distorted, and most camera shots are so long that you can barely see the dancers. Don't bother with this one."
3,Dancers' technique very good but Nutcracker ballet abridged,"I last watched this production on television when it was originally aired 20 years ago. Since then, I have gone to several live performances by different productions and, in comparison, I was disappointed by the video after recently purchasing and viewing it. Athough no criticism can be made of the dancers or costumes, it appears that characters were deleted (such as the Snow Queen and Sugar Plum Fairy) as well as dance sequences (such as the Arabian dance), perhaps to give more time to showcase Mr. Barishnikov, whose part of the Nutcracker/Prince would normally have been smaller. I believe this is unfair to Tchaikovsky's ballet to change it in this way."
5,i have seen this video and i want it for my grandchildren,"the costumes, ballet techniques and form are excellent. the ballet has drama and excitement which young people, both boys and girls, greatly appreciate. male student's in my first grade classes always asked to have the tape rewind so that they can watch the strength of the dancers as they leap and catch the leading lady."
1,duck50,"Very simply, the picture quality of this version is terrible. I played it on an audiophile grade Oppo Universal Blu-Ray player which will upgrade the quality of any DVD and it was still very, very grainey with overly washed out colors. I recently viewed a 2008 production by the San Francisco Opera and it was superb. Look for another version."
5,Best Nutcracker Production Ever!,"My husband taped this production of the Nutcracker that aired on PBS, way back in the 1980's. We watched it with our kids every year at Christmas until they ""outgrew"" that tradition. We now have two granddaughters, so I purchased this DVD to start watching with them. Unfortunately it was so hectic this year, that I haven't even opened it yet! I've seen it a dozen times, it's a great production, the best as far as I'm concerned, so I am giving it 5 stars. We hope to get it watched this December 2013! Yes, I would recommend this production, starring Baryshnikov."
5,HOLIDAY FARE FOR EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR,"Under Tony Charmoli's customarily fine direction,with Baryshnikov's early choreographing, his and Kirkland's first rate dancing, a sparkling dance ensemble, beautiful sets and color still undiminished, and a masterful score, was created a delightful film whose charm is irresistible. Without need to compare how this one stands up against other available DVD performances, I feel confident in recommending it to all age groups, for its consistent high style and its two stars, who glitter brightly among the other jewels. Watch it for the holidays, and in between holidays to provide some holiday cheer."
2,Suprisingly Weak Nutcracker,"Considering the many high rating of this production I was very disappointed and suprised to find it below average. The costumes look more like Halloween outfits and the scenery looks cheap. The worst part is the story line which is so lost that unless familiar with the Nutcracker a viewer will not understand this one. The entire last half is just disconnected dance after dance. The dancing is just OK but with no story line it is just dancing. In contrast I very highly recommend the Royal Ballet version with Miyako Yoshida and Jonathan Cope, excellant in every way that this is bad."
1,Don't waste your money,"Save your money and don't buy this. The recording seemed to play like it was coming out of a box and about 20 minutes into the music, the CD started skipping. Not once, not twice, but repeatedly over the course of 5 minutes. While I can make some concessions for the skipping for packaging error, the quality of the sound makes this a worthless buy."
4,Nutcracker dvd,I would recommend to purchase this dvd.Purchased for my grandson and he loved it.Fun for the whole family
5,Made my wife's day,"My wife always talked about how special watching this around Christmas time was to her as a child. Finding it to watch this season was great, and the delivery was quick. A great buying experience."
2,OK but not as good as hoped,"this rotary blade was purchased to use on fabric as you would any pinking shears but it is not the same cut as scissors and not as sharp as I hoped. When I was cutting the fabric it was necessary to press down very hard in order to get a complete cut across and still each time there was a small area not cut. I will try another brand next time. I have cut with this blade but not washed the fabric so I'm not sure if the fabric will fray or not.Changing the blades was very easy, no problems with that."
3,Decorative edge blade,"I bought this blade to use in place of my pinking shears. I like a pinked edge on my packaging designs for my business. However, this is not a true pinking edge. It's more scalloped. It doesn't have the sharp peaks like the pinking edge. The edge of this blade are more shallow and rounded. I was disappointed."
3,Fast and easy...but cut edge isn't as nice as that from actual pinking shears,"I've had the same pinking shears for years. The shears make a very nice crisp zigzag edge--great for both appearance and also for fray-control. The only problem? They don't cut very fast, or easily for that matter, and I always end up with hand cramps if I have much to cut. Recently, I had to cut hundreds of 9"" long pennants out of various vintage fabrics. The pennants were then strung on cording to create long stretches of hand-crafted banners and placed throughout the lawns for an outdoor wedding. No way was I going to be able to do that many pennants with regular pinking shears. I've always been happy with my straight-edge rotary cutter; so I ordered the pinking blade. While it definitely made the job of cutting out hundreds of pennants MUCH easier, I was disappointed with the finished edge. The sawtooth on the rotary blade doesn't make the same crisply pointed zigzag edge as the pinking shears do."
3,"Cuts fabric, but not sharply","I bought these so I could skip serging/zig zag-ing fabric edges on woven fabrics.Let's just say the fabric still frays in the wash because the points on the blade are rounded instead of a sharp point. That leaves the fabric rounded also,k which in turn allows fraying the wash.Shoot. I bought these over pinking shears because I read that pinking blades/shears dull quickly. I figured these would be cheaper to replace, but it looks like I will still have to shell out for pinking shears anyhow.I still use them in hopes that it will equal less fraying."
1,Save your money,"Boring, bad production, better left in the past. Only sounds good in the state of mind of the 60's-70's."
4,Music from the Grave!,"Having followed Canned Heat from the early 60's, I was excited to see new music from their ""pinnacle"" years. Some tracks=Great! Other tracks= Not too hot. Bob ""The Bear"" Hite is at his best in the studio banter between songs, but the lack of Henry ""The Sunflower"" Vestine on too many songs makes this a ""made-for-money"" compilation. For my money, Living the Blues still stands out as their best effort, along with the live ""Live from the Topanga Corral"" album, soon to be re-released as ""Live from the Kalaidascope"" this month (October 2000) True Canned Heat fans will eat this album up, mostly because there is so little Alan Wilson material that has not been released. Worth the low price, though, I have to admit."
5,Canned Heat,Good typical Canned Heat Album I like it very much I am very happy with this goes well with the old Kombi.
5,YAY!!! FINALLY A BOOK THAT ENLIGHTENS,"Being a Sat guru I have found few books on this plain of existence that can truly aid a being in their soul evolution. I first read this book in 1998 and have recommended it to several of my students. I recently re-ordered this book for Yogi Mithananda. We have just spent part of our first day going over parts of this great piece of literature which has once more proved to me that this book is essential reading and studying for anybody on the path of true / real awakening.Sincerely, Satguruyogiprabhu[...]."
4,"Simple, clear and effective",This book is a staple of my spiritual food. I use the ideas in it everyday and go on a mental diet every quarter. I am not always successful bit when I am the results are profound and even when I fall off my life is better.
