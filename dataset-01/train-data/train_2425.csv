1,BUYER BEWARE-FATAL FLAW,"While the wood is sturdy the hinges are atrocious. In less than one week the screws fell out and the hinges came apart. Failed design, Failed craftmanship. Do Not Buy. For the record i purchased two (different sizes) they both sufferred fromthe same fatal flaw."
5,Quality - easy to use and nice to look at.,"The nicest gate we have ever seen - very pleased. Quality finished wood, nice addition when the a gate is needed -"
5,Great for small dogs and for small children to step over,"I AM SO HAPPY WITH THESE GATES I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE! THE OPENINGS ARE VERY SMALL AND MY YORKIE CAN NOT FIT THROUGH. ONLY 20 INCHES HIGH, WHICH IS GREAT FOR MY CHILDREN TO STEP OVER, BUT THE YORKIE CAN'T. THEY ARE VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND HIGH QUALITY!"
3,Gorgeous gate but no good for smart or agile dogs,"These gates look great in my Victorian house. We even get compliments on them! However, our smart little terrier mix figured out quickly how to push the gate until she gets an opening she can fit through. We've tried heavy bricks, door stoppers, all to no avail. And our agile bigger dog (she's not that big, maybe 40 pounds), can jump it easily. So if you have a small, not-too-bright dog, this gate is perfect for you :-) Me, after two years of trying to make it work, I'm looking for something taller and terrier-proof."
3,Not Adjustable,"Once you put this together, it is not adjustable which makes it hard to store. You can fold the outside legs/stands but that's it; it does not slide to become compact."
5,Satisfied customer,"Some have complained that the gates are small (vertically) but that is not an issue for our collie. The gates are well constructed and attractive and they blend well with our decor. Adjustable but not flimsy. The only reservation I would have is if your pet is taller or a jumper, it probably would not work for you as the gates are only approximately 14-16 inches tall. We have two of them and they have worked great for us! In fact, wish we would have found them sooner to save us the hassle of trying several other gates (taller but flimsy/prone to falling over/ugly). They are attractive enough that I am even allowed to keep them up when we have company unlike the other eye sore ones we have owned. The protective bumpers on the bottom protect our wood floor from further damage and the design makes them very stable. From our viewpoint, the low height is an advantage as it creates a barrier for our dog but is low enough for us to step over the gate without difficulty. We love them."
5,Great solution,"Great product, just what I've been looking for. It's attractive and functional without requiring any installation that would impact existing stairs or ballisters"
5,"Richell Wood Freestanding Pet Gate, Large, Autumn Finish",This product is absolutely great. It is easy to move (or step over) and fits in well with our wood floors. I ordered the large size so I could adjust the length for the various door openings in our home. Our new puppy is safely restricted where we want her.
4,Just what I needed,"I have 15 inch Beagle puppy from field stock, I needed something to block him from going through a 5 foot wide arch way into the living room. This did the trick, until he got full grown (six months). Short of putting up a chain link fence in your house this will work."
5,Didn't think it would actually work!,"This gate rocks! We have Bichons that refuse to potty train and we have tried so many gates. I really didn't think it would work but bingo, they can't jump over, they can't move it and it is adjustable! Fully open still solid enough to keep them out and low enough to walk over. We are ordering another one and I have no doubt it will be greatly appreciated!"
4,"Not tall, but aestetically pleasing","This freestanding unit is sturdy, well built, and and versatile. It is not for large animals that can make the jump, however, it is a nice barrier for not only small animals, but small children as well. A little pricey, but still a well made unit."
5,Excellent item,This product works great for protecting your pet. I needed this to stop my older dog from following me down the stairs. The gate is also adjustable in length. It looks more like a piece of furniture than an unattractive gate which is wonderful since I keep it up all the time. Easy to put together. I would highly recommend this product.
3,freestanding gate,Very attractive for large spaces however our pet could get out of it easily. My husband attached it to the wall with hooks that close. That made it more functional. Without attaching it to the wall it would not have been worth the purchase due to our smart pet.
3,freestanding pet gate,"The pet gate is made well and looks great. However, not high enough for lab puppies once they figure out they can leap over it. We purchased three gates to block entrances into the family room and study, the puppies are 5 months and clear the gates like reindeer.The gate should be higher. I am a bit disappointtednow that the dogs can jump over them."
5,"Pleased as ""punch""","I am more than pleased with the gate. It is a handsome addition to my kitchen and works like a charm for limiting my dog from entry into the rest of the house. (I had some fears he would learn to jump over it since he is a ""hyper"" Jack Russell, but, so far, so good!)"
2,Well made but to short,"This gate is very well made & was easy to assemble, but it is to short to contain my 10"" high Chihuahua (he simply jumps right over it). It might work well for small children, but I don't see it as being viable for most pets."
2,"aesthetically nice, functionally useless","This gate is very nice. Its well made, easy to put together and looks great. Unfortunately, it is incredibly useless. I dont know what size dog this gate is suited for, but it must be tiny! I have a toy yorkie who is 4 months old and only 4 lbs and within 1 week, he learned to jump over this gate. The pictures of the huge dog lying down inside this gate must be photoshopped. There is no chance that this tiny gate can keep any dog confined. Maybe its intended for ferrets or smaller animals?"
5,I Love this gate!,"I love this gate! it's soo beautiful and it's solid with high quality. We use to use 12"" closet shelving with the lip on the floor so it would stand at the entrances by itself, altho closet shelving was cleaner looking then the taller dog gates from other companies it was still not as pretty as Richell gates. My dogs are trained not to jump anything in doorways, rather it be 5"" tall or 20"". We only like step over gates. It's so much more easier and cleaner looking. Richell gates are beautiful."
2,"Not good for dogs,... maybe toddlers?","It is not adjustable or easily movable, so you have to step over it. Which my dog learned that's all she had to do very quickly. Because it's not moveable, it's inconvenient. Also, one of the reinforced holes to attach the side was off set, so I can not actually set up one side. Not happy."
2,VERY small dogs only.,"Agreeing with many of the previous post. While this is a very attractive and easy to assemble gate, my short little Shiba jumped over it after about 5 minutes of being penned off from the rest of the house (her domain). Maybe it is just my dog, but we're going to need something at least 6 inches taller."
1,Easy to fix! Okay for ONLY small dogs but DOESN'T WORK for PUPPIES OF LARGE BREED!!!,"I received this pet gate today! I got this for my 9 week old German shepherd Puppy weighing about 21 lbs! He is jumping off this fence like a piece of cake!! This looks like a toy for him! I was in desperate need to give my puppy a Little more space when I go to work! So he wouldn't be constrained in his crate. It didn't work well!The title of the item on the Amazon website is very deceptive! It says ""freestanding pet gate Large..""; Hence I thought this might help me in the future but on the box that I received, it says ""suitable for small dogs""; so be careful what you buying for!"
1,Not tall enough,"This gate would be awesome if your dog cant jump. I used this fence with my Jack Russell, Boston Terrier, and Great Dane. They just jumped it..I guess if I had a chihuahua it might be sufficient??"
4,Very attractive and functional,Ordered this to keep my 3 dogs from library and dining room. The wood matches my hardwood floor perfectly. It is short and recommended for smaller dogs but my lab has not tried to go over. I like it because I can step over. Assembly was not difficult- just know that the length you set is bolted- you cannot slide sides back and forth once you set the opening width without undoing bolts. This actually makes for a more sturdy and attractive item.
4,i use it as a toddler gate,"we have a toddler and we are renting a house with steps that lead down to the front door. drilling holes into the wooden banisters isn't an option for us so we placed this barrier at the top of the stairs. it is beautiful and matches well w/the decor. however, it is a little short which is fine for adults (and our 6 year old) who climb over it to get to the door, but we worry about our toddler who has been trying to imitate us to move his leg over the gate. it has served our needs thus far... and as he gets older, we anticipate we'll need to focus more on training him to not climb it or move it out of the way. still, it is good as a deterrent. the rubber grips on the bottom, designed to keep the gate in place, is not as effective as it sounds because our toddler can easily move it."
2,"Short sides, misleading info","I found the size information misleading. The side gate is only 11"" deep; the remaining 7"" of that measurement is the stability foot. I bought this to surround my fireplace and keep kids/pets away, and it's not big enough.The polished wood and grill are attractive."
5,"Great Quality, Very Functional, Looks Great, Easy to Assemble","I needed something for the bottom of my stairs to keep my 40 lb dog on the lower level. Since this is in the foyer of our house, I wanted something that looked good. This gate is IT! Can't believe I didn't order this sooner. It was a cinch to assemble, sturdy, and perfect for a stairway where a pressure mounted baby gate won't stay. Our dog isn't one to try to jump over or push the gate - clearly, because it's freestanding, you can't expect it to contain a large breed who's determined to break out. For small and midsize dogs, or larger ones who just need a visual barrier, this is ideal. I definitely recommend this - it's pricey but worth it if you want something attractive and functional."
3,doggie gate,"This doggie gate is very attractive. It was easy to put together. We like the doggie gate, however, our yorkie can jump over it. I had previously read that it was tall enough for yorkies, but ours' can get right over it."
2,Fractured hip trap,"Our 36 lb dog is not a jumper, so this gate at 17 inches contained him well. However fore and my wife who are quite elderly and not as spry as we were 20 years ago, to step over it was a hazard. We installed a handrail on the nearby wall but still felt at risk of falling, which is a major cause of serious injury in the elderly. If you are youthful and have a sober sober chihuahua or Yorkie, this could be just what you are looking for."
5,Pefect gate,"This gate is sturdy and well made. Perfect , exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend it if your looking for a gate. I did a lot of looking before I purchased this one. No regrets"
5,Amazing read,"Extremely well-written, engaging and inescapably funny, the final resolution ties together a plot that is fufilling and rewarding. Even for someone who lives in the Beltway and could care less for the intricate details of mass-produced culture, this book was a great introduction to just how non-meritorious the entertainment biz seems to be."
4,Entertaining but not a masterpiece,"A very witty, totally cliche oriented tale of Hollywood. It's impossible to not see the humor in his over-the-top story of various Hollywood players. From the almost Producer, to the Uber (in love with himself) agent to the hopeful actress who will do anything to be a star, this movie has it all. It's written in diary form by all the characters and relates the same events from various participants. At first it's difficult to follow but eventually the storytelling is very funny as you learn more of the characters.Of course the most sympathetic character is the poor mistreated writer since a writer wrote the book. But this character is so pathetic; he almost deserves everything coming to him.One more tale of a supposed good story that Hollywood jerks around till it looks totally different. At least that we know to be true in real Hollywood. I actually would rate this 3 1/2 stars if I could."
4,"funny, and sadly, probably true","This ""diary entry"" novel is a quick read that provides many laughs. As a person thinking about getting into the screenwriting business, I think this book offered me a little reality as to what to expect if I go through with it. Writers are the peons of the Hollywood scene, this book shows that in a very funny light."
1,Don't waste your time,"I wasn't expecting Dostoevsky here -- just the light and entertaining skewering of Hollywood ""On Spec"" is been promoted as. But aside from not being particularly well-written or having any engaging characters (or story) to speak of, the book commits the unpardonable sin of simply not being funny. PS: Anyone who compares this to ""What Makes Sammy Run"" ought to be ashamed of themselves."
3,my thoughts,From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down I was convulsed with laughter. Some day I intend reading it.
2,Puck is a glimpse into the real story yet to be to told.,"If baseball star Kirby Puckett were a biblical figure, he would be a cross between David, of David and Goliath and Samson, of Samson and Delilah. Unfortunaely Puck: Baseball's Last Warior doesn't approach the telling of the whole story. It is too much of an abreviation of his life and efforts. It may be that the public will have to wait for Kirby Puckett to publish his own more autobiogrphical life story for us to know what makes the man so generous, likable and thus so tragic to have had to leave baseball playing in his prime. Until such a book is published Puck will have to do for those interested in an abreviated look into the life of Kirby Puckett."
5,The extraordinary grace of ordinary people,"Carol Bly's stories call me home. She captures nuances of Midwest culture, and in particular, aches in the souls of Midwest women, with a startling precision, honesty, and eloquence that reminds me of everyone I ever grew up with.But a Bly story goes beyond simply the personal level of her characters' lives. ""Chuck's Money,"" for example, the final story in her new collection, is a penetrating analysis of issues of class structure, power politics, and moral crises in Small Town America as they play themselves out in quiet marriages, church carpools, and funeral suppers. Through the eyes of bookkeeper Leona and her oak tree of a husband Allen, we see how the suicide of a teenager sets in motion a series of events that redress old and new injustices. The net result is an exuberant image of people who can be so decent sometimes it takes your breath away."
1,Big disappointment,I bought this because several reviewers had compared this series of books to Hillerman and/or Cole. This is not even in the same league! The dialog is so unnatural it is almost laughable at times. I hate to see other similar books come to and end but I thought this one would never end! It was a struggle to stick with it. I probably should not judge their others by this one but it will be difficult to force myself to try another one!
3,Ella Clah is hard to find,I have been working months trying to get all the Ella Clah novels for the library. They are really hard to find in hardback! I don't know who be suspicious of--the publishers or the book sellers for only running single editions of hardbacks and then flopping straight to mass market paperbacks. Even a sturdy softcover would be better than the MMPs.
2,Not as I expected.,The cup appeared bent. it was not round as i expected and the person receiving it also questioned its shape..
3,milkshake cup,you would need a metal cup to make milkshakes when using a hand held blender. this is a christmas present fora future daughter inlaw.
3,Metal Cups,"Purchased this for an older Hamilton Beach mixer, unfortunately not realizing this cup was made for something much bigger than I or anyone else could conceivably have. This cup was crafted for ogres and giants to create human smoothies, not for someone such as myself that just wanted a quick treat. Be warned; it's big!"
2,Not for shaking up drinks...,"While this might look like the bottom half of a alcoholic mixed drink shaker, it is not. Due to the indentations along the sides, when placing a glass pint on the inside, inverted, it will not fit snugly. There are gaps and it is not leak proof. Your drink will shake all out of the cups.Nothing is wrong with the product, it's actually fantastic for it's use, as a blended shake holder/maker. Not as a alcoholic drink shaker maker."
1,BEWARE,"Do not buy! If you make anything that has an acidic ingredient, such as orange juice, everything has a strong metallic taste. This item is not stainless steel because a magnet does not stick to it."
5,Handy Mixing Cup,"This is a handy high quality stainless steel mixing cup! I use mine for making smoothies, milk shakes and other drinks with my hand held blender."
4,good for 2 shakes,"bought this to go with our milk shake maker and although it doesn't fit the machine, it does work. Grandson can make more than 1 shake at a time and still be safe working with a machine. Easy to clean."
5,It's a milkshake cup,What can I say? It's a milkshake cup. Good quality and durable milkshake cup. I would recommend this to a friend
1,Recommended with Hamilton Beach Drink Mixer...NOT,This is too tall to use with the drink mixer. It also has a finished bottom that is either welded or soldered neither of which I trust being made in India. I will find another one piece mold like the one that comes with the mixer.I went to www.hamiltonbeach.com and found that by clicking the parts tab and entering the model number I can order an exact replacement with no solders or welds. This would be my choice. However it would also make sense to just order another unit at $30+ bucks and have it all! :D
3,cup,"The base is to narrow for the hand held blender that I bought this to use with. I couldn't tell from the picture and description whether it would work or not. Other than that, the cup itself is fine."
4,Mixer cup,"Got it to be used with aCuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed Chrome. It will be a very tight fit (the attachment won't QUITE make it to the bottom) but it appears that it might work."
4,Like the size,The size of this makes it easy to use my emmersion blender to make smoothies and milkshakes withoutMaking a mess and holds enough for two servings
5,Versatile Tool,"I got this to go with the new handheld blender I bought, because this has a larger capacity than the measuring cup that came with the blender. I've used this once so far to make a milkshake (worked perfectly), and several times to make fluffy scrambled eggs with the blender. Clean up is very easy, as this cup is dishwasher safe. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this cup."
5,Use these cups for photography,"I bought these for my black and white photography chemistry as each chemical needs to be brought to the appropriate temperature quickly and metal works best. Photography stores have these same cups, but for MUCH more money because they're ""specialized."" These work every bit as well, are very sturdy, and hold up to repeated use, washing, and lugging around in bags. I got all the cups I need for the price I would have paid for 2 or 3 at a photo store."
4,Good value,"This appears to be well made, and for the price, it's a good value.I bought it to use with my Westinghouse SA23950 stick blender, and it's not a great fit for that particular blender. The base of the cup is just a little too small for the (oversized) blender unit and won't reach all the way to the bottom. Not a flaw, since it wasn't sold as a mate for our particular blender. Just something to be aware of if you also have an oversize stick blender."
4,Enjoying my stainless cup,"I love my large stainless cup. I use it to bring a drink in the car with me. I am deducting one star because it has indentations that make it look like it came out of a milk shake machine. It is large enough to not slosh my drink all over and fits the cup holders well.It has no taste, no plastic, non-breakable. . . just a great cup to take in the car at a really good price for stainless steel. It washes really well in the dishwasher, too."
4,Great For Shakes & Drinks,This 30 ounce cup is great for using with a hand blender to make your own skhakes at home. It also can double as a shaker for mixing up cocktails bartender style. The cup is durable and can withstand most abuses.
4,"Quality cup, but gets cold and wet","I got this cup to replace the plastic cup that came with my hand blender. The cup is great, but if you blend cold items, the metal frosts up, gets cold and wet, so it is not that pleasant to hold if you choose to drink straight from the cup. I use a neoprene sleeve to hold the cup. I am sure using hot liquids would also be a problem.Easy to clean. Well made. Perfect size. It does get narrow at the base, but my hand blender fits all the way to the bottom."
1,Disgusting!,"This is the most disgusting thing I have ever tried to read. Obviously, I didn't manage to get to the end...or the middle."
1,"Not even a ""fun"" trashy read","I simply had to write a review here of warning, since this book is not inexpensive. I wouldn't have minded spending the money if it was AT ALL worth it, but I'm sorry to say this book was simply silly and boring. I actually threw it in the trash after reading about a hundred pages of it. Basically it vascillates between three different small tales all tied together. Two ""Deliverance-type"" characters who make their living running moonshine and have their fun having sex and murdering, two women from the ""big city"" and a deformed Appalachian young man with a big penis, hence the name Bighead. I like gore. I like gross if it's well-written and intriguing. This is just plain stupid. I can't tell you how it ended, because it was just so dumb and boring that I had to throw it out. Please don't waste your money."
1,Just gross,"I should have known when I read the first chapter of this book I would hate it, but I decided to give it a chance because I liked the idea of this big deformed creature roaming around the woods. I was wrong, the bighead parts were not that bad,but the parts with those 2 disgusting guys(sex offenders) was just too much,it literally made me sick to my stomach. I just do not understand why authors feel the need to put this violent x rated junk in their books, I want to feel scared when I read a book not disgusted and violated."
1,This crap is killing real comics,"Recently there have been great strides in comics. Even the late Will Eisner's hope for a graphic novel being reviewed in the New York Times was recently fufilled with David B.'s ""Epilectic."" However, comics written off of television shows are even worse than recycled humor like Archie. I've always been a Superman fan, and I even watched the first season of Smallvile, but there's no excuse for this."
1,Kids may enjoy it but you won't,"While this CD is a good value, you will pay for it in other ways. The singing is so sugary and fake one listening is all an adult or older child can bear. It instantly reminded me of Barney. However, younger children should enjoy the music and the songs are well chosen so if you can tolerate a bubble-gum sing-song style (like Barney) this may be a good option for you. I will stick with Raffi, which is always a good choice if you want something upbeat and cheerful, yet genuine."
2,Not so understanding,I did not like this book because it seemed to me that the author just went to the library and got all of his information for the book. He did not do a study of his own to confirm his findings. He just believed everybody elses research instead. Also he does not state why he believes this information to be true or why it would be true. There is some information that is helpful but it is very scientific and a little hard to understand without going back over it a couple times to review it. I have also read a book by Dr.Shettles and its very easy to understand and he explains why he believes all of his findings to be true. We will use Dr.Shettles' method.
2,How to Have a Girl,"I have to agree with the other comment on this book. When I bought this book, I also bought the Shettles method book. The Shettles book is a lot clearer and uses scientific evidence, along with actual testimonials, to back up its theories. The author of this book directly contradicts what Dr. Shettles says (which doesn't make sense since Dr. Shettles can prove his theories and this guy cannot)and he offers no proof of his theories. I'm trying for a girl and even though I haven't started yet, I plan to use the Shettles method."
1,Nothing really works,OK It wasn't clear. I won't use this. But a word to all other readers -- I've used Shettles twice and it doesn't work! (I have 3 boys).
1,Too Much to Read and Too Long!,"This book was too much to read and too long! For pete sake, we are trying to have a baby, not build a computer. I want a baby girl bad but after several tries of this book that didn't work, I'm going to find an easier way. Amazon, send my money back!Emily J."
5,Earthfire by Robert Simmons,"This is a wonderful book. Illiciting both tears and laughter and a sense of connection with the characters, as it follows their path to uncovering mysteries both in the physical and spiritual realms. While a true threat to their lives by some secret agent thugs stays mostly in the background our heroes pursue the puzzles of alien abduction, near death experience, shared visions of a world transformed,and personal visions by way of the works of Rupert Sheldrake, Carl Jung, the poet Yeats, tarot cards, a channel, Holotropic breathwork and the energy of gemstones. A couple of our male seekers start out insisting that all this must bend to their educated and intellectual guidelines but are drawn into the pattern of synchronicity and then beyond what can be neatly explained. Ultimately it's the opening of the heart and their love for each other that guides them through the final crisis and it's a tale told in a beautiful way."
1,dogs dvd,this movie didn't do a thing for me at all.it was boring most of it didn't even look real at all.
2,"In it's day, it would have been a good movie.","This movie is a 1976 ""B Movie"". That means that this was a low budget movie when movie budgets were only about $25,000. Keeping that in mind, the movie wasn't horrible; but it also didnt have any special effects, which I didn't think was possible for a horror flick. It also appeared to be totally filmed in a supermarket parking lot."
1,KILLER TERRIERS?,"This movie tried to do for the canine set what Hitchcock's BIRDS did for our feathered friends, but believe me, it's nowhere near the classic.DOGS is basically an abysmal movie, replete with ridiculous plotting and horrible acting. Even NCIS' David McCallum, sporting a bowl haircut, looks embarrased to be involved. With no real reason given except for increased pherenomes, this town's canine set is going bonkers when they're in packs and attacking and killing everyone. There is no terror involved though...how can a terrier or a cocker spaniel be frightening? Skip this..it's for the dogs!!!"
5,The Micklers of Florida,The book gives detailed information of the Mickler Familyin Florida. It is very good for genealogical use which iswhy I ordered it because I am a descendent. It wouldn'treally be of much interest to anyone else. It's not astory.
3,very interesting,I found this book to be especially interesting to me because I know several members of the Mickler Family. It was very well written and I enjoyed it very much.
5,Stumbled upon a great product merely by accident...,"I was looking primarily for a XM ready unit and stumbled upon this product without knowing the brand or rating of this device among other owners. I usually do my homework but this time I needed to make a quick purchase. Needless to say, I am amazed by this little unit.The purchase was made for my mom who needed something simple to operate and could play a wide variety of formats as well as needing the XM capabilities.After getting it all hooked up, I quickly became envious of what I had purchased for my mom. The sound is great...amazing! Easily plays cd's and DVD's. The XM stations sound great...especially the HD channels. All this for a great price and such a small package...you know what they say; ""Big things come in small packages!"""
1,Open the box before your ability to return to Amazon runs out,I received this as a gift and didn't open the box because I didn't have anywhere to put it until after the 30 days to return to Amazon expired. The CD/DVD drawer on the unit didn't work. I couldn't register the unit with Onkyo (required to get warranty work) because they didn't have a record of the serial number (?). The unit had a date of manufacture of 2005 - it was bought in mid-2007 so this was kind of odd. It was very difficult to get the unit in - the place was over fifty miles away and was open during work hours. Not only was the power unit broken and had to be replaced but the inside of the unit was dirty. There is a good chance I paid a new price for a refurbished unit that was never repaired. The stereo sounds good but now I hope nothing else goes wrong since the warranty expired before I heard it play the first CD.
1,"it blew after a year, and Onkyo didn't care","I was pleased with this at first. I did not use it heavily - it was a bedroom system, not my main one. After just over one year, so just out of warranty,it gave a loud bang and then made no sound. I did all obvious troubleshooting and then called Onkyo - they just said that it was my problem, and to take it to any service shop at my expense. Their closest Onkyo specialist service was six hundred miles away. Unacceptable. Save your money - buy something else."
5,Bàsico.,"Para alguien que comienza en el espiritismo como complemento en su vida religiosa -entendiendo que es santero- y no tiene mucha guìa, este disco es bàsico para aprender los cantos empleados en las misas y ceremonias. Ademàs, para los neòfitos, ofrece una parte importante dentro del folklore y la cultura cubana. Con pocos elementos se consigue un producto sencillo pero rico en matices. Muy recomendable, ademàs, es difìcil de conseguir, yo lo busquè, incluso en Cuba, y sòlo lo pude encontrar en Amazon."
3,Not my favorite by a mile,"I really disliked how the hero and heroine interact in this novel.Cally ran away, because, big surprise, she thought she caught her husband, Nicholas, cheating on her hours after their wedding. She didn't even confront him, instead she just ran off and hid herself in various little towns around the country.Of course, she wasn't actually as hidden as she though she was.Nicholas is now confronting her and demanding she play the role of wife again-- in order to save a community project she had been working on in the town she had be living in. He blackmails her into being his wife and delivering a child in exchange for supporting her project.It is sort of uncomfortable to read books where sex is bartered like that, especially since she really isn't all that willing.As the book unfolds, Cally learns the errors of her assumptions and becomes a far more willing participant in the baby making."
4,Typical Ms.Craven .....,"Will he get his wedding-night baby? Virginal beauty Cally Maitland has become accustomed to life on the run since fleeing her marriage to aristocrat Sir Nicholas Tempest. But Nicholas isn't prepared to let Cally go. Indeed, he has a harsh ultimatum to deliver: give him their long-overdue wedding-night - and provide him with an heir!Eventhough the idea is not new, I love most of Ms.Craven's story line, very typical and interesting."
3,no speaker,"Be advised NO SPEAKER.Purchased it and returned it, still waiting for refund....sure wished it had a speaker....as some people cannot ware plugs..."
1,Disappointment,I was looking for this to replace my Sangean DT-110 which I have liked.Sangean DT-110 Digital Pocket AM/FM Stereo ReceiverThe DT-180 is not nearly as sensitive in pulling in the stations I listen to.
2,Quality not what I expected,"While I respect the other reviewers, I cannot recommend this product. When I ordered this I was seeking a product I could use in my work cubicle. Now please note I am on one of the highest floors and a great window. Reception is poor to non-existent.For audiophiles, I have pulled up the FM spectrum near my location. The strongest signal, on this receiver sounds like it is barely above the Noise Floor.Sorry folks...not worth it."
1,Sangean DT-180BK,"Very poor FM reception spoiled an otherwise fine product. AM reception is good. Product design is good. I tried several different sets of earbuds and earphones, and could not get the two FM stations that I listen to most often. Very disappointing."
5,Outstanding little radio,"I've owned several small portable radios over the years. This is the best by far. The form-factor and functionality is particularly well thought out. For example, the lock is really nice for carrying in a pocket, so you don't accidentally turn on the device. I also like the auto 90-minute shut-off - keeps me from accidentally leaving it on for an extended period and burning the batteries. I rarely give out 5 stars, but this one deserves it."
4,Recommend,One of the best sounding portable radios sold in the US. I like to use it at the gym. This is my second one. First one broke after two years. That is why it is not rated 5 stars.
2,Died after 5 mo. intermittent use,"After about five months of using it perhaps twice a week, I started getting an ""E"" display with no sound. Initially, turning it on again would resume play, but then after a second, it would resume the silent E. Ultimately, it would not turn back on."
3,Bunk lock feature.,The lock feature broke after a year of occasional use and it does not come with a clip. Good reception though!
3,If you use a smartphone or tablet while listening to the radio you get horrible interference noise.,Don't buy if you plan to use while using a smartphone or tablet. Otherwise seems like a good product. Like that it has preset stations.
5,Sangean DT-180,"Well pleased--again--with this product. My first Sangean DT-180 failed after several years of daily use. The lock switch on the rear of the unit failed, i.e. the radio would shut off after the few seconds of auto time-out regardless of switch position.Do I like the radio? I immediately replaced it with new DT-180."
1,Very poor reception,I was greatly disapointed when I turned this little radio on. Extremely poor reception (a mini ipod has 4 times better reception!!). I had a Sangean radio once and it performed nicely; unfortunately this didn't meet my expectations AT ALL.
2,"Disappointing, very poor reception","I'm disappointed with this radio. Both the AM and FM reception is terrible downtown. I would expect better from a cheapy $5 radio, let alone a $45 one. My Sansa Clip gets much better FM reception (too bad they didn't add AM). Granted, I live in downtown Chicago where there are a lot of signals to conflict with, so maybe this would work better outside the city. Still, I'm surprised by constant halo signals from other station a full point or two down the dial. I get the best reception from the TV band and this goes away in less than a year. Consider me not a fan."
1,It Didn't Work,"The radio looked nice. That, and the 90 minute shutoff feature, is why I bought it. But when I took it out of the package, and put the batteries in it, it didn't turn on. It never did turn on, so I put it in an envelope and sent it back. I would gladly have taken a new one(that worked) but Amazon just credited my money to my card. I had received two other Sangean radios in the same order(all with auto-shutoff) so I'm happy."
4,Nice Radio,"I needed a AM radio at work. My co-workers have i-pods, I wanted to listen to sports and news. The dual sound is really nice because other units are one channel.I would recommend this model."
4,A great little radio!,"This is the second Sangean DT-180 AM/FM radio I have purchased. I needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. A great little radio that I use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. Long battery life and it picks up the stations I listen to. Very happy with this radio. I suggest buying your own earphones. The ones with this radio are just odd."
2,POOR GIFT,"I purchased the radio at AMAZON.COM for my wife, who has difficulty sleeping. She uses the radio to help her during hours of insomnia. She just told me that she is VERY DISAPPOINTED because the sound keeps going ""IN AND OUT"" and for several other reasons. She's so disgusted, that she is going to revert to her old Sony Walkman radio and try that one again.(And that one is working poorly)."
4,Perfect for nightime listening,"I use the Sangean radio for info and ""white noise"" when I go to sleep. The presets are wonderful, reception is beeter than analog pocket radios, and not having a speaker reduces the size. The battery saver (90 minute auto shut-off) feature is perfect. I use just one earpiece and drift off to sleep on the other ear."
1,far less than expected,Stopped working after two days use. Sent back for warranty which cost a flat $6 plus insured shipping. Flimsy build quality and extremely directional for both AM and FM reception. Sorry I purchased the unit. Maybe the replacement (if I ever receive it since never heard from warranty repair center) will be better although doubtful.
2,amusing but not true to jane austen,"this is an amusing adaption of pride and prejudice, but i would have to admit that if i were looking for something true to the book, i would have to go with either the 1996 or 1985 version... it was most dissappointing that it did not include mr. darcy and miss elizabeth's chance meeting at pemberly which is what brought the story together and made it ""pride and prejudice"" (the point that darcy lays aside and pride and elizabeth lets go of her preconcieved prejudices)... i would have to say that the only thing that made this movie pride and prejudice were the characters names... however, it was a delightful little film to pass the time away (if you have not read the book) my advice is spend a little extra money and purchase one of the earlier mentioned films (the 85 or 96 version)"
4,"No, it wasn't like the book, but I enjoyed it","No, it wasn't like the book, but I enjoyed it like I enjoy other movies that are nothing like the Pride and Prejudice. As a movie, all by itself, it's a masterpiece. The costumes are gorgeous (although not period-correct for Austen's novels) and the acting is great. I do not think cinema could ever do Austen's work justice. Watch the movie, it's fun. But if you want a real treat- read the book, it is candy for the imagination."
4,"Quite different from the more modern versions, but charming in it's own way.","This version of Pride and Prejudice takes quite a few liberties with Jane Austen's most beloved story, but manages to endear itself in spite of that. Olivier's Darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with Colin Firth or Matthew MacFadyen, but he does so well that you'll be charmed by him in no time. And Greer Garson's Lizzy is as spirited as you could wish. The costumes are all wrong, yes, and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in Regency dramas, but once you get over that, and immerse yourself into the story, you'll be swept away. Highly recommended!"
2,Not what it should be,"I watched this version of Pride and Prejudice immediately after reading the book. While I enjoyed the movie well enough, I was disappointed in how much was left out. Some of my favorite scenes from the novel were omitted from this movie. I couldn't enjoy what I felt was not a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's work. I would recommend the 1996 BBC/A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle above this version. The recent adaption adheres to the novel more faithfully and does not leave out what I feel are important aspects to the story."
2,Pride & P,I like a newer version with Colin Firth.Also this version is in B & W and is not set in the right time period.
2,all star cast,I give it 2 stars because it's a all star cast but the movie itself did not stand up to the test of time. Watch the BBC production with Colin Firth if you want anything close to the book. There was so much herky jerkey head bobbing going on you wonder if Greer Garson has tourets and they were wayyyyyy to old for the part.
3,"A lovely classic, but not without it's flaws...","This wonderful film features fine acting, lovely sets and a timeless plot I'll never tire of. However, while I feel a lot of these characters are portrayed very acurately (indeed superior to some of the later adaptations; while the '95 A&E; adaptation is marvelous, I can't get over how exaggerated and annoying Miss Bingley, Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins are), I feel that Darcy and Elizabeth are grossly misrepresented. Lizzy is far too mature and lacks the youth and impertinence that embody her character. Mr. Darcy is far too charming; he is agreeable from the beginning!This adaption is worth watching, whether you like P&P; or not, and offers things some of the later versions do not. However, it still has it flaws, I continue to wait for the perfect adaptation to come! We'll see how P&P3; compares, as its the first movie adaptation of the novel since this version (excluding Bridget Jones, P&P; - Utah, etc.)."
5,Greer Garson,"I am very happy with this DVD,it was in great condition,the case and DVD,so once again Amazon has done me well!"
1,I wanted to like this,"I am an avid reader and admirer of Jane Austen and I also love classic hollywood films, so I was really hoping to like this film. With such a cast as Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, it is a shame they were not offered a better film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to work with. The faults with this production are too numerous to list entirely; the screenplay, the costumes (Victorian, not Regency)...well, everything. Laurence Olivier would have undoubtedly been an ideal Darcy if he were allowed to actually play Austen's Darcy and not this watered-down Darcy. It is a shame but at least we have the BBC production, which is wonderful. Above all, there's Jane Austen's wonderful novel to enjoy--no production will ever replace it!"
2,Good basis,"This film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, Pride and Prejudice. It represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and Austen novels; however, it is not great in terms of adaptation. If you love Pride and Prejudice and have never seen this film, skip it. It will only anger you. If you're studying film adaptation of Austen novels, you MUST see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards. AND--it's Laurence Olivier, afterall!"
2,Just shoot me now!,"I adore both Greer and Lawrence, but not in this film (and I use the term very, very lightly). I used to think that when I saw these movies when I was younger that this was close to the author's vision. The clothing for the women is not even in the right time period. (which the studio's were famous for.) Most importantly,Jane Austen could never recognize the ending of this movie as a part of her vision at all, because it's way out there. Watch the pivotal character of Catherine debourgh and see what happens all for the sake of making the studio happy. Some of it was totally unrecognizable. Do yourself a favor and see A&E's presentation with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I'm giving 2 stars one for Sir Lawrence and the other for Greer because it wasn't their fault I'm sure. If it wasn't for them I couldn't have brought myself to give any stars at all. Enough said!"
4,Well Worth Adding To Your Collection,"Of course I have this version of Pride and Prejudice, but I also have the BBC's version from the 80s, A&E;'s version from the 90s, and Focus Features' version from the 2000's. My personal favorite remains the A&E; version--I adore how detailed it is and how over-the-top it is--very theatrical and romantic and fun! The BBC's version is probably the most accurate. ""Keira Knightly's"" version is the most romantic. :-)However, I honestly enjoyed this ""Greer Garson"" version, because it was the ""happiest."" Everyone met someone in the end--including Mary. If you like your sugar with coffee, you'll love this version of Pride and Prejudice. ;-)"
3,Not for hardcore Austen fans - but very enjoyable,"This is a charming little film, based on Jane Austens famous book. It is very hollywoodish, funny and charming and the writers have taken quite some room to shuffle things around. Easy forgiven, though. Olivier is splendid as always and Greer Garson may be the most perfectly cast Elisabeth Bennet there has ever been. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but would not recommend it to my friends who love Austen och the ""Colin Firth""-version from 1995 more than a good movie."
5,GOOD MOVIE!!!!!,"Laurence Olivier does a GREAT job playing Mr.Darcy! I would recomend this movie to ANYONE! The cast was superb! I loved the garden at the very end,I liked it how she showed off while shooting arrows.It was soooo funny how the mother was sooooo obsessed about getting her daughters married to rich men."
4,a grand first impression,"greer garson is way too old to play elizabeth bennett, and too much of the tale is omitted, but olivier was a wonderful darcy. until the obsession with adapting jane austen novels hit a decade or so ago, this was THE movie version of an austen book, and the one that encouraged many of us to (oh my, does anyone still actually DO this?) READ the books. it served as my introduction to austen, and i will be forever grateful to the fine film for that, and am grateful its made its long-delayed arrival on dvd. now go read the damn book! (i have half a dozen times, but not in almost 20 years -- i plan to cure that soon)."
2,It Will Not Do!,"As a lover of classic movies and a fan of Greer Garson I really wanted to like this movie but it is not very good. Both Ms. Garson and Mr. Olivier were really bad, I hate to say it, but it's true. Ms. Garson was a fluttering hummingbird and Olivier a stilted, very bad actor. No chemistry, no depth, and really bad acting. I won't get into the details such as faithfulness to the book, costumes, set ect. as I could have overlooked these things had the story and acting been good. It just wasn't. Maybe if I never read the book I would have liked the movie? I don't think so, but, who knows?"
1,Garson & Olivier,I thought this version of Pride & Prejudice was terrible. It was silly.If Olivier would have played more of a subdued confused man capitivated by Garson's character of Elizabeth instead of the silly role he played it would have been great. A character as one he played in Wuthering Heights.
2,"Movie OK, ""Features"" Superb!","I have to tell you I am NOT a fan of ""Pride and Prejudice"" as an entertaining movie, but there were some choice moments.HOWEVER, this particular DVD package has a ""Special Feature"" that just BLEW ME AWAY! WHY this was added onto the movie I have no idea (maybe it was in theatres about the same time as ""P&P;"" came out), but the ""Eyes of the Navy"" short is just FABULOUS for this Naval aviation buff!My dad was on the USS Enterprise during WW II, and we live in San Diego. The ""Eyes"" short features...the USS Enterprise and the Naval Air Station at San Diego as it was in 1940. W-O-W!!! Footage of BT-1's, TBD's, F3F's, etc was priceless! The short is kind of a combo of prideful exhibition and recruitment for Navy airmen, and gives a ""realistic"" look at Naval Aviation as it was just before we went to war.I Loved It!"
1,Crummy DVD,"This is a review of the quality of the DVD. It is a foreign import of very bad quality. Do not buy it. The sound does not match the lips. The picture is of low quality. I was not patient and wanted this wonderful picture on DVD. So please wait until the official American DVD is available, which I hope is soon."
3,Good but not great,"I liked the old the movie look. It was interesting to see how someone else interpreted the movie. But it was missing lots. But still, movies now are not made on giant lots and stages, so it is definitely worth seeing a classic. The Colin Firth version is still my favorite, but this is good if you are short on time."
4,Hilarious! Pride in Prejudice in southern Gone with the Wind style...,"I really don't know what to say about this version of Pride and Prejudice other than it just hilarious. I don't watch many 1940s southern romantic comedy either so it was so strange.It was so weird watching the story in like gone with the wind style lol. I do like Lady Catherine in this version, loved how they changed that part. My only compliant is that the movie could have been longer. I wanted more development between Darcy and Elizabeth. If your a Pride and Prejudice fan you must see this version as well. Little old but very nicely done by the actors and writers. I agree with the other reviewer about don't compare; just sit back, relax, and just enjoy it."
5,great movie,this movie has to be my favorite version of pride and prejudice and greer garson was wonderful. the movie arrived quickly and without any problems
2,Not a Fan of this Version,"It was campy, and departed from the novel in a way that totally corrupted it. The characters were too old and chewed the scenery more than should be allowed by any director. Not a fan of this version !!"
2,READ the Book,"I liked the leads and Mr. Bennet. But they changed WAY TOO MUCH of the story for this adaptation. WTHeck Lady Catherine at the end??? Um, no! I was willing to ignore the hoop skirts -- maybe it was the director's choice to change the setting from Regency England but why? But to make a major character change? Nope. It went from charming -- if odd-- adaptation to betrayal of the book. Plus did it bother any one else that Garson looked older than Jane (she was) and maybe even older that Darcy?"
1,"The cover says Pride & Prejudice, but the movie says different.","I couldn't figure out why at my job this movie was categorized under comedy where the other versions of it are under drama but after renting it I understand why. Even if you have never read the actual book and have only seen the other movie adaptations you will also be disappointed in this movie. I couldn't get through the movie and never actually got to the part where Darcy and Elizabeth interact. I think Laurence Olivier is a great actor but I don't think even he could have made me enjoy this movie. If you want to see a good version of P&P I suggest renting the BBC/A&E version which is considered by most the best adaptation or I'd even suggest the Keira Knightley version, which even though it had its own faults, it wasn't that bad."
5,A sweet story of relationships and a happy ending.,"Though not following exactly Jane Austen's book, it is wonderfully adapted. I've watched it again and again and I never get tired of it. After seeing it so many times and having read the book, I am amazed at the ingenius way that the movie was blended to bring in many of the main points that the book had made. Very well made in every respect: casting, editing, directing, acting. Almost the perfect film as far as I, (50 years of age) am concerned."
4,Great Stoy and Acting Make Up For Bad Costumes!,"Pride and Prejudice is a famous classic novel by Jane Austen and there are several movie adaptations one of which is this black and white version from 1940 starring Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennett and Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy and though this older version isn't as good as the newer versions, the version from the 80's that starred Elizabeth Garvie and the 90's version that starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are definitely better but this older version is good too. Yes the costumes from this 40's version are from the wrong period and look like rejects from Gone With the Wind and are definitely more American Southern Civil war period and not Regency England but the story and acting are great and I think that the incorrect costumes can be overlooked and I recommend that Jane Austen fans have an open mind and give this movie a chance!"
1,Horrible,I can't believe anyone having anything to do with this film ever read the book. From the costumes to the acting it is horrid. Laurence Olivier rather than being a taciturn and to many appears as an arrogant person actually boarders on being foppish. I'd never seen him on stage and if his portrayal of Darcy is any indication of his acting there then I'm glad I never got the chance. Greer Garson is far to old and the film which over all touches so briefly on the story throwing in a few of the actual lines now and then is very dissapointing.
3,Go with the 1980 BBC version (or 1995 version),"First--the movie was entertaining, but...Greer Garson was too old for this role, I thought. Olivier made a good ""Mr. Darcy"". I thought that often the sly wit of Jane Austen never made it to the screen. The 1980 BBC version seems like Jane's novel ""come to life"", at least for me. My husband and I both rewatch that version every few years and find more clever lines to laugh about each time. I agreed with an earlier reviewer who greatly missed the scene late in the novel where Elizabeth's Prejudice and Mr. Darcy's Pride find love. Surely this movie could have found space for that scene at least."
5,as good as they come,"I read the book after I watched the movie, and I found that the movie distilled all that was splendid about the book and enhanced it. Perhaps my memory is failing me, but I found the book a bit drab in comparison to the movie. Yes, the movie captures one the nicest love stories wonderfully."
3,It was okay....,....but it didn't follow the book very well at all! Greer Garson was a great actress but the P&P she was in just wasn't good at all! There were parts that were straight from the book but 85% of the time it wasn't.
1,Cannot recommend,"I watched a bit of this version on television and quickly realized it's failings. I assume it was a Hollywood production and so often they ruin these classic stories for those who have cherished the books. While you can expect some alterations to allow for reducing a novel to an hour and a half, this was really just poorly done.I had enjoyed Greer Garson in several films, but she just just wrong for the role of Elizabeth Bennet, and Olivier was far too expressive for Darcy. Disappointing.There are several other much better versions available on Amazon, especially the mini-series version with Colin Firth."
5,"1930s, Pride and Prejudice","I found the movie very enjoyable. The characters are rich, colorful, and full of humor. Arrived in fine condition, it is a gift for my sister. I viewed the movie to make sure the DVD was not damaged."
3,greer garson,It was good for the year it was made. But not even Sir Laurence can beat Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy
5,fast and efficient!,"Such an amazing movie and even better that I received it so quickly!! I've been looking for this particular version for quite a while now, and I received it within 4 days after I hit buy. Never opened and in mint condition."
1,Stay away,"Now that the studio has reissued this movie on a domestic dvd, the import (for which the sound is not synchronized with the picture) is no longer necessary. Stay away from this one."
1,Jane Austen as slapstick,"It could be worse. No it couldn't. Costumes are from an entirely different period. Scenes are inserted that would never have occurred in an Austen novel. The plot is fractured to the point of unintelligibility. The tidy happy ending is thrust on the viewer at the last minute. It reminds me of Steve Martin's ""adaptation"" of Cheaper by the Dozen. Only the title remains."
1,Absolutely Dissapointing,"After I read the book in one day my husband went out to rent the video that same day because he knew I loved it so much. Through out the viewing all I could say was, ""Oh no! this isn't Elizabeth or Mr Darcy wasn't like that! What is this?!! This movie has it all wrong!!"" I almost turn it off. I hated it. Please anybody planning to see it, don't put yourself through the pain I put myself through."
1,"SO PAINFUL TO WATCH I COULDN""T EVEN FINISH","I just read the book for the first time and was so in love with it I rented this pathetic excuse. The costumes were totally wrong. Hello? Several characters were totally misinterpreted. And I was ready to accept that it was going to be a little different from the book, but parts of the book that could have been translated quite well on screen were TOTALLY different for no apparent reason. I have to admit that I didn't finish it. When I heard Elizabeth tell Mr. Darcy that he was too proud, to which he responded that she was too prejudiced, I was outta there. I can only hope that one of the other versions do the book justice. This one hurt me."
3,Finding love in olde England,"Greer Garson stars as Elizabeth Bennet in this 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice. She plays the clever and witty eldest of five daughters, who are all looking for rich husbands. Lawrence Olivier is Mr. Darcy, a suitably wealthy prospect, however he is too arrogant for Elizabeth's liking. The story follows the two as they tease and rebuff, only to end happily, as we always knew it would.Greer Garson was much too old to play Elizabeth, and was utterly unconvincing. Olivier was wonderfully snooty as the aristocratic Mr. Darcy. The costume design was problematic. The ladies' gowns and men's suits looked like they were borrowed from the set of Gone With the Wind. The dresses were full and puffy, not at all like the delicate and low-cut gowns of the early 1800s in England.The screenplay was co-written by the famous Aldous Huxley, who, it seems, had no knack for reproducing Austen's glorious dialogue. All in all, I found this film satisfactory, but not beautiful or memorable."
3,"Pride and Prejudice, The Early Version!","There are a lot of rave reviews for this 1940s version of Pride and Prejudice, but I found it mostly to be downright silly! Not only were the costumes not authentic for the period, the actors seemed old for their roles, and several scenes that are in the book were eliminated. For instance, the part of the story where Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner accompany Elizabeth on a tour of Pemberley and encounter Mr. Darcy was left out. That was an important part of the book because it is where Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle really get to know Darcy through his housekeeper and sister. Darcy shows them around the estate and invites Mr. Gardiner to go fishing and invites them to dine with him. I also thought the role of Caroline Bingley was just over the top and overly imperious compared to the character in the book. I think that the best movie version is the one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."
1,grotesque distortion,"If you love the words, characters and plot twists of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice you will dislike, even hate, this movie. Every character and scene is a grotesque distortion of the masterpiece. Who would have the nerve to take Austen's unparalleled dialogue and clumsily rephrase it? (Aldous Huxley for one as it turns out). Why turn Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a heroine? The characters are almost all as unrecognizable as the leftover ""Gone With the Wind"" costumes. There is zero chemistry between any of the actors and even Laurence Olivier seems to be sleep walking through his scenes. It makes no sense. Save your two hours for Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy."
3,not as good as the A&E version,"This adaptation of P&P is enjoyable but strays from the book in ways that will annoy die-hard Austen fans. While much of the dialogue is straight from the novel, the plot is changed in crucial ways that conflict with character development. (Lady Catherine approves of Lizzie in the end? I doubt it.)"
2,A Mixed Bag,"While this version is some what entertaining, you can't help but feel cheated. A two hour version is simply not enough to cover this Jane Austin classic. Many things were left out and changed for the sake of time. I will say though that Laurence Olivier is excellent as Mr. Darcy, but Greer Garson is not even tolerable. She's actually annoying like most of the cast. Almost completely miscast.Like another reviewer said, the 1990's version with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle ruins the 1940 version. If you put both verison side by side, you will see how the older verison pales to the modern version. Colin Firth is Laurence Olivier's equal when it comes to the portayal of Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is perfect as Elizabeth. The updated version IS the definitive adaption of Pride & Prejudice.Another point: Men should stay away from this movie. I couldn't finish watching it. It's way too feminine, but the 1996 version is recommended for any one who appreciates a great story and wonderful dialogue."
1,I wish I could have given it no stars,"They need to find a new title for this book. I love the book and was disappointed to find this horrid tale. It should be subtitled ""A movie loosely based on the title of a Jane Austen novel."" If you can't come up with an original idea for a movie, don't ruin the reputation of a good book. The best Pride and Prejudice is with Colin Firth and Jennifer Erhle. Presented by the BBC and played on A&E. That is a good movie. Not this filth."
1,VERY LOOSELY based on the novel!,"Jane Austen would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this film adaptation had done to her brilliant novel. The characters' names are the same, but nearly every plot detail is so different from Jane Austen's original story as to be nearly unrecognizable. Most of Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue is missing from the characters' flat conversations, and the ladies' dresses are fashions that Jane Austen never saw in her time. Any devoted fan of the novel must be disgusted by this Hollywood mutilation of an excellent story."
1,Murdered the book,"I frankly do not see how anyone in their right mind would have rated this move 4+ stars. Excellent actors in a bad movie. Maybe good at the time, but ....The screenwriter must have hated Jane Austen's work."
1,Horrible!!!,"This is the worst version ever filmed of an Austen novel. It offends in so many ways. The plot and characters are changed radically from the book. Greer Garson is too old by 20 years to play Elizabeth Bennett, and her acting is smug and affected. The actresses playing her sisters are much younger and more beautiful than she. On the other hand, the character playing Mr. Bennett is well-cast, and I supposed it is a nice touch to have the other three Bennett sisters be very pretty. But in this version, Darcy and his Aunt are the nicest and most democratic--modern American, really--people you'd ever want to meet--no class snobbery there! The only value of this version is as a curiousity, but Garson really ruins any entertainment value it could have. The 1995 Ehle-Firth A&E verson is superb in every way, and I do recommend that."
3,Interesting study- period film from WWII,"This version of P&P, made by MGM in 1940 makes a more interesting study when you look at it as a pre-America's intrance into WWII film. It follows a swing of propiganda in favor of joining the war to save the England."
1,Computer Problems,"I returned the DVD to Amazon, because it wouldn't play on my iMac, Operating system X. I am extremely annoyed with Amazon for supplying an unworkable product. And Amazon didn't even respond to my complaint on the return form, just credited the account."
5,All colors $5.99 at Marshall's,"Sometimes I like to go on Amazon to make sure what I bought at Marshalls TJ Maxx, Homegoods, etc were in fac good deals. Today all 5 items I bought were cheaper than Amazn - which hardly ever happens. Im only writing the review for this item as the price $5.99 is alot lower. They had Blue, Pink and Green at my Marshall's in clearwater FL. Perfect for my little potted herbs in the kitchen, where storage is at a premium in my little bungalow."
1,skewed pricing,I own one of these that I bought at a local hardware store for under $10. These are wonderful watering cans--I have all three sizes. But really--$40 for a quart sized watering can?
4,"Really comfortable, but quite large","I bought these to wear around in Afghanistan, as I am required to wear eye protection at all times. They are really comfortable, but unfortunately they are quite large. I can't wear them without the goggle strap, or they will fall off my face. I am somewhat disappointed because I purchased them to replace the other standard eye protection we are issued by the Army. I am still wearing those and plan on swapping out for the goggles when I am in full gear. I am quite petite, so they may just not fit my face. I doubt a regular size man would have the same issue as I am having. Great product though."
4,Full Circle marks the entrance of a troubled companion .,"Full Circle, while it might not be one of the best Dr. Who episodes, does hold it own. This story marks the entrance of Adric, an intelligent yet nieve and sometimes selfish boy from the planet Alzarius. This story marks the beginning of the E-space trilogy. The Doctor and Romana II find themselves on a small backwater planet in E-space where its people are warned not to go near the swamps because of Marsh Men, which are actually a furthered form of the Alzarians. This story is interesting with heroes, heroines, monsters, and spiders, and ends with Adric as a stowaway on the TARDIS."
4,It is time to pick up the time winds and make DVD formats!!!,"The E-Space trilogy is wonderful entertainment. If you are a Whovian then I believe you are growing increasingly annoyed with the BBC's reluctance to speed up the production of Dr Who episodes in DVD format. At this rate we'll be all old and senile before we get to see our favorite episodes again. Mine are some Pertwee episodes as well as the Tom Baker and Peter Davison era.Several other reviewers have already said enough regarding the contents of this series, I just hope there are enough BBC producers reading and heeding my commentary. Also the price for these old shows should be lowered. I would think you'd find a larger buying audience."
5,The only chalkline you'll ever need.,I do building layout as a important part of my job and after using the Hanson Pro 150 I'll never use anything else.
5,Arturo toscanini stereo,"I have been thinking for a long time that the NBC Symphony Orchestra was a bad Orchestra. It should not have been even compared to the other major ones. But since I heard this recording which is a genuine stereo, I totally changed my mind.Oh, such a beauty, powerful, subtle nuance, heart-rending delicacy! I wish I could listen to the Toscanini's all recordings in Stereo. Toscanini has been badly misunderstood because of the really poor recordings.""Pathetique"" is a very sorrowful performance. There is a mistake in the first movement (Toscanini might have given a wrong sign to the wood sections. ) The fourth movement was stunning. I wept. It is a really beautiful performance. Toscanini had already known that the NBC Symphony would be dissolved when he performed this Symphony No,6. His sadness is reflecting this live performance very well."
2,Hard to Read Novel from a Great Writer,"This will be an odd admission. I've read all of Grant's work and think they are among the greatest works of story-telling in our field, science fiction or fantasy. I have tried to read this book twice now and failed, for a strange reason. I can't read the really unusual font, and its incredibly small size. This isn't fair to Mr. Grant because what I did read kept me fascinated. But time and again, I just couldn't plow on. It seemed a real effort. I know. It's my fault. Maybe you'll have better luck with this book, but find Tex and Molly in the Afterlife and In the Land of Winter and particularly Kaspian Lost (they all have recurring characters). They're fascinating and well worth your time. Sorry, Mr. Grant. I just couldn't physically read this one book of yours."
1,Fabio is truly a stinker.,"Fabio is lousy as a model, writer, actor, whatever he does. He is no better as a singer. Thankfully, the platinum blonde supermodel does not perform the whole way through. By the way, the only reason I got this CD was to torture my brother who is just as disgusted by the idea of Fabio as a singer as I am."
1,Dear lord this is horrid.,"This CD is amazing.If Only Fabio had come into my life at an earlier time, My marriage might have been saved, and I might spend countless lonely nights while my husband shot pool sinking into the dulcet sounds Of Fabio's horrid accent.Where were you, Fabio, when I needed you?"
1,i can't belive it's butter,"if ever there were signs that the world was coming to an end, this is it. how bad can a record get? Fabio doesn't sing (so it could be worse), but he does heave in a heavy voice that sounds like he's making obscene phone calls. Romance? Play this record for a girl and she will bolt for the door. Fabio is good as a model for the cover of romance books, yet he is no singer. Now Will Shatner...there's a talent."
2,Mine was a lemon,"My had a problem. It would shut down by itself, sometimes within ten seconds after taking a picture. Obviously that's not how it's supposed to function. I returned it and did not ask for a replacement for I might get a similar dud."
4,"Easy to use, great camera","I have only one complaint, it didn't come with a case! Other than that its a great camera for the money!"
5,Awesome Little Camera,"I spent over two weeks looking at several different cameras offered by Amazon and reading reviews on each one. I've have an RCA digital that I bought several years ago and it's been a great camera BUT it doesn't have the options like the newer ones have today. With my budget I had to conserve on my spending but at the same time I wanted something I would be plezzed with...I finally decided to go with the Kodak Z700 and let me say, I'm not sorry for doing so...This ""little"" camera packs a punch. I love how ""easy"" it is to operate and with a little bit of reading in the instruction booklet that comes with the camera, I found it's pretty easy to navigate thru each type of settings. I also like the Video/Audio feature it has built in...Overall, I would Strongly Recommend those with limited budgets and want an awesome little camera then by All Means..BUY THIS ONE....You Won't be Sorry...5 Stars is my choice for this camera. Thanks to Amazon and Kodak."
5,Very Nice Camera,"I bought this camera as a gift for my friend. She just loves it. It gives her clear sharp pictures and of coarse the dock is a super plus. Very easy to use and make prints in minutes. Also charges the camera when not in use by simply placing it back on the camera dock. The only little down side to it is that she really loves to print a lot of pictures and of coarse the picture paper is a little pricey. Other then that, she is very pleased with her new digital camera and dock."
3,Kodak Easy share z700 4 mp digital camera with 5xoptical zoom,"batteries go out pretty quick, but all in all its a good camera an sturdy for the kids to use, which is why I got it in the first place."
3,"OHHHHHHH, so THAT'S the problem!","I went through two battery rechargers and three sets of rechargeable batteries before I came here and discovered LOTS of people are having trouble with the camera doing an auto-shut-off AS IF it's out of batteries when actually it's probably a battery compartment problem. I confirmed that it's a compartment problem on mine by putting in brand-new alkalines: the camera still shut off after a few seconds.Other than that problem (which is finally fatal in my camera, but after 2-and-a-half years of steady use), I liked the camera and recommended it to many people. It's easy to use if what you like is a mostly automatic camera (that's what I like---I don't mess with the manual settings), and it has a good zoom, and I thought the picture quality was quite good considering the price of the camera.I won't recommend it anymore, though, now that I see the battery problem is common."
4,Pricey repair quote,"I too purchased this camera online. I believe that the camera itself took quality photos, but upon the lense no longer telescoping. I contacted the repair line only to find out that they quoted me $150 for the repair! I could not locate my receipt, even though I purchased it new online and registered it, they would only say, ""no receipt, no warranty"". Valuable lesson learned.Keep receipt... nice camera."
1,Not good!,"The printer did not work, it only printed 1/2 of the picture. I am having a real hard time with trying to get it replaced, and I had to send it back to the place that Kodak has that works on the printers, and they could not fix it. They told me they had to send it back to the manufacturer, Kodak, to get it replaced. I am still waiting on the replacement.This is the first and last thing, I will buy on Amazon!"
3,Special offer not so special,"Honestly, I haven't tried the camera yet. It looks good coming out of the box and has nice features, assuming they work. BUT BEWARE! I ordered Amazon's special offer that goes with this camera: a free Compact Flash disk. Only to discover that THE SILLY CAMERA DOESN'T TAKE A COMPACT FLASH CARD!!!! So my great deal isn't quite as great as it seemed.Let that be a lesson to me--don't expect they're Amazon folks to know what they're doing.I'm off to Walmart for a dang-gum SD memory card."
4,"Good Camera, good price, good perfomance, many features.","If you want no expend so much in a digital camera with a lot of features and if you know something about prhotography that is the right choise, you find everithing for take good pictures in automatic modes, but you have to take a good course for understand all the basics of camera for use in manual mode, so that, the camera is nice, look that a expensive camera and take picture look easy when yor have some expience with this great camera, why I dont give a five stars? because manual control are very hard to understand and make dificult to take pictures in some situation."
2,Nice looking camera; not user friendly nor quality,"I purchased this camera for $199 at Walmart -- and promptly returned it a short while later.Pros: lots of settings, easy to use (in automode)Cons: lots of settings (too many), the LCD viewer doesn't reflect the actual photo, and taking low-light pictures is very cumbersome and not easy. So, this camera is not easy to use for common family pictures indoors; photos are always dark unless a flash is used or manual settings are enabled (the settings of which require a rocket-science degree to understand)."
1,Camera died after 1 year and 4 days. Repair cost close to original cost,"We never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new. And one day, the lens just won't open. It lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically. Called a up a Kodak Service center and they gave me a quote for repair.The price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in Amazon!I'll never buy a Kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs. I do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point. So I'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.I think Kodak is making expensive disposable digital cameras"
1,DEAD AFTER 6 MONTHS!,I bought this camera brand new 6 months ago. It has been used very lightly on birthdays and holidays. It has never been dropped and stored properly but now it is dead.Aside from my bitterness over it going dead so soon I would still give it a low rating because of how fast it goes through batteries. Two AA batteries would only last one photo shoot. It is relatively easy to use and the picture quality was good but this camera is not mechanically sound.
2,KODAK RIPS OFF THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH THIS CAMERA,"I purchased this camera for my office. I had to convince my boss that Kodak was a good camera and the dock system was the way to go...unfortunately my recommendation turned out to be a nightmare!! We spent almost $300 for the camera and dock station - haven't taken 75 pictures with the camera and it is junk! When I turn the camera on it extends the lense about 1/4"" and then retracts and shuts itself off. I tried all of the sites from Kodak and after numerous correspondence with Kodak the conclusion is: 1. I can send the camera back to them and for $125.00 they will fix it. (I can buy a new one for $129.00) 2. I can send the camera in and they would sell me a ""refurbished"" camera for between $250-$300. OR 3. Pitch the piece of junk camera and buy anything else but a KODAK....I'm going with #3 !!! Save your money and time trying to deal with Kodak!!"
2,I HATE THIS CAMERA,"I seriously hate this camera. It keeps dying! Even if I charge it forever, it only lasts for 5 minutes once you turn it on. My crappy $50? camera lasts weeks before needing to be charged. The features are okay though. Sometimes the pictures come out blurry, but I like the videos you can take. Also, it's too fat and big."
3,Great ........But,"I did my research before getting this product, as a matter of fact it was suggested by a friend. Several months later I am a not happy with the printing - I can print about 4-5 pictures before getting a message that the ink is running low. Then probably 3 more before I have drained the ink cartridge all together.Not happy about that at all. Rethink this one."
1,"Battery hog, very frustrating!!!!","I haven't learned how to use all the features on this camera, but I'm sure when I do there won't be nearly enough battery power to actually do it. This camera will run about a half hour on fresh batteries, and then it just turns off. I thought it was defective, but a camera guy told me the Kodak digitals are like that. I would recommend a different brand with a special battery pack, not one that runs on two AA batteries. I'm going to try rechargables just to save some money, but this will never be a good camera for trips or outdoor stuff. Also, it sucks at landscape pics, bright colors (such as sunrises and sunsets) appear washed out and pale. Even a bright fuschia forest-fire sun is an anemic pale yellow (maybe that's just a digital thing)."
1,Bad performance. It turns off suddently at the 2nd. day.,"I think Kodak is not a good brand for digital cameras. They always have some functional problem...This camera looks like a cheap material, it's heavy and not handly. I don't recommend this product. Also, the second day that I received it, it started to turn off by itself... I'm still waiting for my money back... I hope this bad purchase finish in good terms. In CONCLUSION: Do not buy Kodak Digital Cameras any more. This is my second experience with the brand...So, belive me...it will be a problem in the short term."
2,Same old. Same old.,"Nothing new under the Billy Blanks sun. And f'kryssakes, I wish he'd get rid of that irritating chick to his left; or at least de-mike her."
3,What happened to the sleeves?,"The olive color looks good and is rare in a zippered-hoodie. The quilted lining is nice and warm. But only get this if you have skinny shoulders and/or short arms, or if you like to have your sleeves rolled up (like me!) - the arm length is about 3"" too short in L. It's made in China, so go for one size bigger than your normal size."
5,A VERY TOUCHING BOOK,"This is a very touching book. It helps you to see what the family, and friends detail with after someone dies. I am 25 years old and I still enjoy reading Lurlene McDaniel's books. No matter what age you are, these books are still interesting."
3,DISAGREEING WITH DONTLISTENTOME,There is too much of Hunter Reno. I think that she should stay more in the background.
2,Outdated and Questionable,"This is actually three books in one which deal with the Amduat and the contents of other underworld books. The book contains the hieroglyphic text, as well as, a translation of the Amduat. Although Budges translation and conclusions are highly questionable the book is still of some use. If there was another English translation of the Amduat, this book probably would have received one star."
5,Upgrade Memory For Dell XPS 410,"Memory arrived quickly, was just what I needed and very affordable. Was a perfect match for my existing 2GB of RAM."
2,Hedge Trimmer,"Yes it can vacuum. It is a course instrument that left linear blade marks on my beard on the first use. Trim was uneven. It's useless for fine trim of moustache etc. Be prepared to follow up with scissors and comb. I've owned several such units over the years, having maintained a beard for 31 years. This is by far the worst."
1,Horrible product,"This product does not trim evenly - some areas of my beard are long, others almost bare. It left me with a stripe down the center of my chin and one side longer than the other.The problem seems to be that the tines used to separate the blades from your face are extremely flexible. The slightest pressure causes them to bend resulting in uneven results.The vacuum is better than nothing, but still leaves a mess on the counter."
3,Mustache & Beard Trimmer Vac Review,"The trimmer works pretty well and it holds a charge well. However, it doesn't vacuum the whiskers very well. It gets most of them, but there are still a lot of whiskers in the sink when I'm done."
3,"smooth trim, great vacuum, non-replacable battery lasts 1-yr","I just purchased my 3rd Remington MB-400 in just as many years. I love the product, its trimmer, the vacuum keeps my bathroom sink clean and its trimmings-catch is large enough for me to shave my head before emptying. But the battery is not user-replacable, and only lasts 1-year. I really wish this was a cordless/corded model (one which can run on battery or AC power if plugged in); unfortunately when the battery dies you just can't continue using it plugged in. Heavy *sigh*. So you'll be forced to buy a new one annually.... which really sucks since its Titanium (or ceramic) blades are strong enough to last a lifetime.I wish some Chinese knock-off would offer black market batteries... yeah they're not user-replacable, but it'd be worth removing a couple of screws!"
4,I good powerful beard & mustache trimmer,The product was good product. It is a powerful Mustache and beard trimmer. Vacuum is not perfect but its catches about 80% of the hair. The major complaint is that the adapter stop working after one charge. Without this problem product would have gotten 4 stars.
3,Clipper review,"Good product, good battery life. Vacuum feature good and bad. For short hair trimming, catches most in tray for easy disposal. Longer hairs clog up everything."
3,"quick and easy, but......","for the price you can't get hurt. quick and eay to use, but don't drop it. plastic is plasticAH"
4,Very cafeful observations of post-WWII arts and attitudes.,"A formally unknown author to me until coming insistingly recomended by my girlfirend,Anatole very successfully retold his life experiences in post-WWII ""avant-garde"" Greenwich Village so that, while living in both a different generation and society, I could relate directly to his observations and reactions. That alone is the power of this memoir. Anatole through his experiences covers modern art, the music scene, and especially attitudes on sex. As with most memoirs, there is no plot; however, there is a great deal of character growth -- and if the reader takes a moment to reflect, to digest Anatole's delicate observations, he finds that when the final cover closes, he too has grown with the work. The memoir unfortunately goes unfinished due to Anatole's untimely death, but does not leave the reader unsastified."
2,"Track 13, Let Us Buy It","I don't understand what the logic is behind restricting one of the best tracks. I know some albums and artists like to do this to try and convince you to buy the full album. However, I know that most people are now not going to buy anything and will probably either wait until it's buyable or will just get it somewhere else for free. Release this track already, it's the one people want and the one that will boost your sales."
3,Blast from the past,"I liked this movie when I was younger, I still like it now. There are no extras on the DVD, and for some reason it seemed to stop halfway through the credits. I could find no damage to the disk. The lack of extras and the wonky disk are the only reasons I took off starts. This movie is cheezy and so very 80's. So if you like B movie 80s horror it is a good watch, not to be scary but it is good for a laugh."
2,el oso grande,The story lines are predictable and the special effects are cheap. I gave it 2 stars because the neigbor's kid like it.
3,a second version isn't the best,"I used to live in Havana 5 years ago, where I heard Catarsis for the first time. I really loved this folks, because they had an splendid harmony, great arrangements and their stage image was really fresh. Something happened in the last 3 years, the original members left the group and the original sound changed dramatically. Any way, it's still a good effort, but second versions are not always the best. I miss the original Catarsis, specially Gisella and Karina. Where they are now?"
4,Wake Me When It Is Over,"I am enjoying SLEEPY RAIN, it is very soothing and relaxing. I woke the other night to the sound of rain and I thought to myself 'I don't remember listening to my SLEEPY RAIN CD before going to bed' and then I realized it was raining outside.The CD is very realistic and doesn't have a bunch of outside noise to distract from the rain, there is a bird sound I could do without but it is minimal. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the bird.I also have SLEEPY OCEANS, it is not as relaxing as SLEEPY RAIN, the sounds in it are more gushing and not as soothing and relaxing.Very well rested after listening to SLEEPY RAIN.I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it to others."
2,not helpful to me,"It's a nice soothing sound, and a good idea, but for some reason, it didn't help put me to sleep. The music looped 2x (played for 2 hours) and I was still awake at 5am."
2,I really wish this would have worked for me...,"I love falling asleep to the sound of rain (and even thunder). I had very high hopes that this would work.I tried it for at least ten nights. I adjusted the volume quieter and louder many times. The longer that I listened to it, the more it sounded like a faucet dripping.Possibly someone could tell me if the other CD's with Delta Brainwave Pulses work any better?It has a lifetime guarantee, which is great.It's really too bad that you can't listen to more of the CD before purchase.I don't like writing negative reviews."
1,Sleepy Rain doesn't work,"I have the Delta Sleep System by the same company. It works great, but the Sleepy Rain doesn't come close. It has weird bird sounds that come from nowhere that are irritating. There is no thunder to relax you. The rain sounds fake."
3,Sleepy Rain Recorded at low volume,Sleepy Rain was recorded with the volume set low. I don't like having to turn the volume up twice as high as for other CDs.
4,in a jazz type of mood,"I put this on and was able to relax into the sound; letting it wash over me. There is a raw power and grace to Myles Kennedy's arrangements and vocal ability that gives you a glimpse of the musican He has become now with Alter bridge. With that being said, the beauty of this album on it's own should not be overlooked as a great piece of fusion jazz."
1,Who edited this book?,"I enjoy the way the content of this book was presented. The short quizzes interspersed throughout each chapter help you focus on the subject matter. However, the editing is atrocious. There are frequent typos, sometimes of lab values, which make me worry about trusting the content of the book. Usually, the answer key is in a different order from the way the questions were presented, so you have to check to make sure you are correcting your answers properly. Also, I was expecting a little more on test taking strategy. As I look at reviews for past editions of this book, I see that errors were a problem back then and I wonder why Random House has not corrected them for this newer edition. I have taken two Princeton Review classes and was always very impressed with the content. Princeton Review should reconsider their decision to have their name associated with this book."
1,Monkeys will help you pass the NCLEX before this book will!,"This book had a nice format, with an organized and interactive way to learn. And its by the Princeton review, so you can't go wrong, right? NO! This book has horrible editing, with answers not matching up to questions and overly simplified explanations of difficult material. This book tells you that a pH of 7.30 is alkalotic and that you should give marbles to a 3 month old. I got frustrated and simply quit using this book all together. Try Mosby's---its a much better and well-trusted review. I passed my NCLEX, but with no thanks to the Princeton review!"
1,In agreement...Awful editing,"I agree with the previous reviewer (Who edited this book?, January 9, 2002Reviewer: C SMITH from Portland, ME USA).Having some experience with other Princeton Review books, I bought the book confident that I would get excellent review material. Unfortunately, I underestimated the flaws the previous reviewer had mentioned (typos, incorrect answer numbering, etc.). Instead of helping me...the book had me questioning my own knowledge of the material and every other answer they printed as well due to the discrepencies. It had me more flustered and agitated than I needed to be.I would steer clear of this NCLEX review book until they cleaned up any subsequent versions."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I passed my NCLEX in February. I bought this book attracted by the CD ROM. I agree with previous reviewers that there were mistakes on both the CD and in the book. One answer even recommended giving marbles to a baby to play with. Book is too simplistic........i bought the Mosby book six weeks before my test and passed using that!!
1,Don't buy this book!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I unfortunately bought this book mostly for the ""8 full length practice tests"" thinking there was 265 questions on each test. There are only about 160 questions on each test and the CD-ROM is not very user friendly, they don't give you an overall percentage, it says it will tell you ""pass or fail"" but on the first test it said ""we suggest more review"". I had to go through all the questions and count how many I got wrong and then figure my percentage. I also could not find out how to get the rationale, but I don't even care, I am not going to take any more tests with this book. Some questions were so easy a fifth grader could answer, some questions were things I had never studied and have not seen in my other review books. I recommend Saunders, Mosby's, and the free NCLEX 3500 online. Don't waste your time and money on this book."
4,Like it,"Bought this for work, and it worked wonderfully. Sound was clear and it was way better than the original one that I had. Only complaint was my ears would start hurting after wearing it for a few hours (I have to wear them for 10 hrs/day)...it's possibly a little too tight around the ears or the padding is not enough? I'm not so sure."
2,Short Service Life - Long Return Policy,"I was happy with this headset for the 8 days it worked. On day-9, no one could hear me on the telephone. After checking connections, amplifier batteries, etc., I concluded the headset had failed. I assume this is not common, but certaining an inconvenience for me. It's going to take several weeks to get a replacement by the time I navigate the supplier's return policy. Also, the connector is apparently Plantronics proprietary and not easily connected to anything except the telephone."
4,Hilarious!,"This isn't a serious self-help book, but definitely one to read when you're at the tail-end of your break-up and can actually laugh at the ridiculousness of it. I read this at a local bookstore, and my friend and I were laughing it up in the aisles (we related a bit too much to the scenarios in the book!). The stick-figure illustrations are really cute and funny, but if you've just broken-up and are still very sore, maybe wait on getting this one. Otherwise, if you want to laugh at all your own crazy antics post break-up, this will have you rolling on the ground. I'm definitely buying this one!"
5,Perfect for some breakup humor!,"This has been our own ""breakup bible"" amongst our girlfriends and I finally had to buy a new copy for my cousin. Its wonderfully hilarious and insightful. It helps keep you smiling and gives you acceptance for the feelings you're going through."
1,Not at all useful.,This book is basically a count from 1 to 100 of things (both could and bad) that people could possibly do after a break up. It's obviously meant to just be funny and not as an actual self-help book for people who have recently broken up. The sad part is that it is not actually that funny. This is one of the few books that I have bought during my lifetime that I returned.
1,Disappointing Police Story,This action packed police story follows in the tradition of Cynthia Khan's famous In Line of Duty franchise but unlkie In Line of Duty suffers from disappointing martial arts choreography. If you're looking for kung fu action embedded in a police story give this one a miss and opt instead for In Line of Duty 4 -- which will give you greater satisfaction.
1,Should have listened for myself before purchasing,Should have listened for myself before purchasing the special price package. Traveling The Sacred Sound Current is pleasant and Chords of the Cosmos drives me and others who heard it... nuts.
4,Namibia - The Brandt Travel Guide,"This book is meant for the first time traveler to Namibia. The book is specifically designed to segment the various locations within the country and cover them in a well-detailed manner. A separate section in the book is dedicated to immunizations and other health related matters - important issues for travelers to Africa. The guide sections covering Windhoek (the capital) and smaller cities are very good giving a wide range of accomodations and restaurants from which to chose. The coverage of Etosha National Park is especially noteworthy as they provide tips on viewing locations for wildlife within the park.Matters that could have been covered more effectively include internet website references for information on health precautions, tours (aside from those advertising in the book) and shopping tips. This information can easily be obtained with a quality search engine for the internet."
4,The start of an amazing series,"As someone who grew up on Peanuts, but hadn't read the really early stuff, this is a remarkable read. The first couple of years are just so different.If you like Peanuts, I would definitely give this a shot."
5,Finally -- complete!,"I love ""Peanuts."" Wholeheartedly and without judgment. I think Charles Schulz was the wisest man who ever lived. I think that if aliens ever come to the planet Earth and want to understand what it really means to be human, they need look no further than these comic strips. I think this is, to be blunt, the highest of art.So how could I pass up the chance to finally read the whole thing from the beginning?I'm only 26, so I missed out on an awful lot of ""Peanuts"" printed before I was born and never reprinted in the books. That was the best part of this hardcover, collecting the first two years or so of the comic strip. For the first time since Sparky's passing in 2000, I was reading ""Peanuts"" comics I'd never read before.The book also contains a few text pieces, including a really good extended interview with Schulz himself that reveals some interesting things about his idea of comics. This book is a great read and a must for anyone who loves ""Peanuts."""
5,Wonderful & Incredible! Finally - the COMPLETE COLLECTION!!!,"To the Estate of Charles M. Schultz, and the Publisher, Fantagraphic Books, there are two words that I can honestly say that says it all: THANK YOU!!!I have loved this comic strip my entire life. Each of the characters have very distinct personalities, I have learned SO MUCH from each one of them that it is incredible!Linus is the pivotal character for me, especially since he is the one who quoted from the Bible on a frequent basis, so I give a lot of credit to Linus for what I have learned about the Bible.These are books that I am going to collect and treasure for the rest of my life...Again, to the Estate of Charles M. Schultz & Fantagraphic Books: THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!"
2,The Incomplete Peanuts,"I was anxious to see all the Peanuts cartoons some day in book form. Too bad the publishers are not being faithful to the reproduction process. They are taking the color out of the Sunday strips. Editing the art of the strip by making it in black & white. I suppose they wanted to save money. There was a Caldecott book winner called Casey At The Bat. This version reprinted the original story as it appeared in the newspapers. They chose to leave in even the errors. Historical accuracy got them the honors. Perhaps the publishers will reconsider on the second printing, and put the color back in where it belongs."
3,Pretty good. One of the few available in cassette.,"This cassette is pretty good, but not as much fun as the Toddlers Sing CDs. I have a cassette deck in my car, not a CD, and this is one of the few available in cassette."
3,Small black & white architectural monograph from Gustavo Gili,"ISBN: 8425217458 ONLY is an exclusively black & white, concise, and copiously illustrated paperback survey published by Gustavo Gili (GG) of Barcelona in English and Spanish (side by side). A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project in excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, sketches, etc. At the end, there are several pages with additional information incl. biography. Most of hundreds of only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN: 37643* (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN: 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London)."
5,Tokyo Mew Mew vol.2,"I am Mia not Frank!(just to let you know) This book continues the cliffhanger ending of book 1, the scene with Kish kissing Ichigo. This book made me want Ichigo to love Kish instead of Masaya or Ryou. In this book the rest of the mew mews are introduced. The stupid names and battle cries don't get any less stupider. That's the only downside. This book Kish in it (yay^_^) and tells alittle more about Mint. Ryou shows his love for Ichigo much more in this book but she's just too dense to accualy see it! If you read the first book then you're probably like me inbetween book 1 and 2; dieing for more! Ichigo still won't love Kish(boohoo-_-)This series is like Sailor Moon so if you like Sailor Moon you'd like this!"
3,Spot cleaner for self cleaning oven,It's ok. I wanted something safe to use in my self-cleaning oven for those spills/spots so I wouldn't have to do the full cleaning. It was so-so - did not work as advertised in my oven.
4,Good movie,"I cant believe this film wasn't such a big hit it deserves. The storyline is terrific. 2 generation told story. The first being the senior actors conflict. Sunil Dutt and Vinod Khanna as father and son, where Sunil Dutt is strict on his high status tradition. Vinod Khanna and his friendship with Anupam Kher (Sunil Dutts enemy). Vinod falls in love with Anupam Khers sister Rambha and makes her pregnant but is forced to marry Ashwini. Both give birth to sons. Second generation is Aamir Khan who's mum Rambha dies and lives with Anupam Kher and Saif who lives with his mum and grandpa with a easy rich life. Both start realising they are step brothers and the hatred starts. Great acting by Aamir Khan and Sunil Dutt. Vinod Khanna was alright, Saif Ali Khan was still new at the time and was OK, The girls were fine. Music is decent and the overall movie is entertaining."
4,Very fun movie based on a stage play,"What a very fun movie based on a stage play. It was campy, it was a spoof, it had all sorts of fun naked guys. I like this kind of nudity on film."
2,"Dull, repetitive and disappointing.","I am a huge fan of Willeford's Hoke Moseley series, perhaps my favourite crime series ever, but Something about a Soldier did nothing for me.The author came across as unlikeable and the stories told in the book were repeated in various forms again and again. There are only so many times a reader can read about Willeford being broke, having sex, getting drunk and being better than the others before boredom strikes."
1,Bachman 2-6-0 steam loco,"Dissapointing purchase. Poor power and side rods hit rails and spark. Even though price is low, it is not worth the price. Surprie from Bachman. Thought more of them to put out this poor performer."
3,Scary but leaks,"This mask was bought for a 10 year old boy. It was scary and a good deal for the money, but beware, the scariest part of it was it was leaking blood after a few days. I had to cut off it's blood supply much to my son's dismay."
3,"Lots of info, poorly organized",The map identifies the castles but provides little organized information. I think to truly get some use you'd have to have another more comprehensive map of the country.
5,Another great work from the late Ray Stedman,This book is not the best commentary on the book of Hebrews but I really love Ray Stedman and his commentaries so I had to have this book. It is another great work done by him.
2,Not Morrell's best,Unbelievable! I mean it. The story is just not believable. It's absurd. Try another of Morrell's books. He's usually really good.
3,A good book that does not maintain the reader's interest,This book starts out as being very exciting but soon winds up being less than stellar towards the end.Some historical aspects of Japan are well-researched and nicely tie into the plot. The character development is done well but in the end the main character of Savage fails to impress. What started out as a capable and well-trained protector turns out to be an emotional and confused protagonist. The explanation for that is also not very convincing and is actually downright outrageous.But of course it is just a novel. Readers will find some good entertainment value in this novel and will get a glimpse into Japanese history and culture which is actually the book's main selling point.
2,i was so confused!!!,"when this book began i really enjoyed it. I thought it was intelligently written and well thought out. What dissapointed me was that none of that thought was shared with the reader. While reading i didnt think i was anymore confused than any other book with such a convoluted plot. However, i was expecting it to be cleared up by the time the book ended. Imagine my dissapointment when the book ended and i still had no idea what the point of the book was. however i read another one of Morrells books and i enjoyed it a lot. ( Thats not to say that i didnt enjoy this one) i just left it feeling so muddled. i cant give this book a wholehearted thumbs up."
3,More like The Fifth Obession....goes nowhere fast.,"I expected a lot more. This book was truly a let down. How much does one need to know about Japanese martial arts and Navy SEAL protocol? Enough already. Developing the human interaction of the characters and just a drop of humor would have made this a much more enjoyable read. I ended up skimming the last 25% of the book, until the last 100 pages, which were intriguing and managed to inject good suspense and a desire to know if these guys were seeing things or not.A much better book,with better developed characters, much more wit and drama is Nelson DeMille's ""The Charm School"". It'll be along time before I read another Morrell."
2,Frustration,"First time in reading a David Morrell novel, the beginning was promising but later found it frustrating and repetitious. Skip the endless lines of 'but I saw you die' sections, you aren't missing anything. Once you know the plot questions that try to keep this novel going, be prepared to re-read these very same questions again and again and again--with no answers either. Skip those sections you aren't missing anything. If you like history, take your time through those sections, a reward for persevering through the mindless repetious sections. Skip the sections repeating 'bile rose in his throat', stopped counting how many times that came up. Skip the sections regarding the Protector's code of keeping things secretative, they didn't bother so why should you bother reading about it. All in all an easy book to read without missing anything."
1,Audiobook awful...,"I listened to the first hour of this book before giving up. The readers sounded so comical that I couldn't stand it anymore. The narrator sounded like he was narrating a 1960s cartoon. And the hero of the story - Savage - sounded like Bruce Wayne as Batman. The readers are listed as ""Cast of Readers"" and I can see why - nobody wanted to associate their actual names with this. Buy the book if you really want to read it, or find another audiobook instead."
3,Exciting set-up but dull resolution,"David Morrell's thrillers can be a lot of fun. At his best, Morrell sweeps you along from one emergency to another, with plenty of surprises on the way.""The Fifth Profession"" starts out true to form. We meet two executive protectors with an unusual shared past and a very intriguing mystery they need to solve. However, about two-thirds through, the book gets bogged down in unnecessary details about Japanese history, while the plot becomes more and more predictable. Like many other readers, I was skimming toward the end, simply wanting to learn the solution to the mystery without caring about the characters anymore."
5,"'' The fifth profession "" - Feel the thrill !","Ever since the readers laid their eyes onMorell's ""First blood"",have they waited for everynew book-birth.This time, the outcome overcomes the expectations.Moreover,this might be his best creation ever;In this enormous work of art, a hidden world ofcourage,force,secrets and codes is revealed.Heros of dignity,nobility and ability face anamies of evil,wickedness and terror.almostnothing seems as it is.revolutions and surprisesappear behind every corner.In all,this is a breath taking book, that willkeep the reader alert and thrilled to thefantastic end.furthermore, it may teach him a great deal about a mysterious world."
1,"Inane, corny","The book has a certain zany energy to it, but the plot is inane and the writing is incredibly corny. I couldn't even listen to it as an audio book. If you're interested in the Japanese underworld read Barry Eisler's John Rain series instead."
5,Advanced and Fun,"Seasun's choreography is for the advanced stepper. This one is very well cued, but it requires your attention to learn it. It's harder than Rock Steady Step, but easier than CIA 2903. Music is instrumental but motivating and the style is more dancy than athletic. If you're used to Amy Bento and Christi Taylor, this one should by right up your alley. Great workout!"
3,He doesn't get it,I liked this book although I thought that Terrell gave Jade too many chances. She was a total idiot in this book. She was kind of giving him mixed signals and he just couldn't let her go...I still liked the concept though.
2,Not her best work,"I'm a fan of Ms. Perrin but this was not one of my favorites. The story line was nice but the main character, Jade was too immature. I expected more but ended up disappointed. Not a horrible read but a little over priced for what the book contained."
5,This was a real good story!,"Accolades to Kayla Perrin for this story about Jade and Terrell. You know sometimes people come into our lives for certain reasons that often can not be explained. The same goes for we often marry people we really know deep down inside we have no business marrying but we go ahead and marry the person anyway, to find out later it was the biggest mistake of your life. In this case, that is exactly what happens but you know readers sometimes that divine force really does work things out for the best. In this case, he brought these two back together, Jade and Terrell, and from there I won't tell the story, but they travel down the road together, sometimes rough and sometimes smooth, but as the saying goes,"" love does conquer all,"" and this book illustrates just that! To my fellow readers, I think you will enjoy this novel done so well by Ms Kayla Perrin."
4,nice read,"jade and terrells story was one of a sweet one. jade broke terrell's heart by marrying another man ,who took every dime she saved up and left her with nothing. six yaers later after losing her beauty shop and working as waitress she meets terrell again at a party and the two begin to see each other again. they work all of their problems and end up marrying one another.there alot more to the story read it and you will see for yourself."
3,Great clock once you get the time set correctly,"It's hard to find a clock with any kind of color in the face so we really appreciate the good looks of this clock.We live in Arizona which does not follow daylight savings time and getting this clock to stick to the correct time was very difficult. The buttons are simple press-to-toggle type buttons and there is no feedback to you let you know if daylight savings time is activated or not. All you know is that pressing the daylight savings time button again will change it from whatever it was set to before. Likewise, there is no feedback to let you know what timezone the clock is configured for. We had to experiment over 2 days fiddling with timezone and daylight savings time on/off before we could get the clock to stick to the correct time. Not looking forward to repeating that exercise when the battery dies.Once the clock has the correct time, it is fantastic! Seems accurate and looks good and is very large."
3,Bare minimum for tree protection,"So far, this has worked fine, but it is not a confidence-inspiring strap. It wicks moisture even if you are being careful to keep it dry, and the stitching seems rather haphazard. I'll likely pick up a higher-quality one and leave this as a spare. Warn products are usually high-quality, at least for the things they build themselves. However, I believe this is something Warn just tacked their name to."
3,Book,Was a little worn but it completed it purpose. Nice to have on hand to add some different techniques with teaching literacy!
3,Grrr! great until the the cutter error,loved this label maker until I began getting the cutter error. grrr! I tried to find some solutions to this but I cannot seem to get past it.
2,Good when it works....,"I've had this labeler for two years, and I've always thought it made very good labels when it was working, but that waste of tape before every single label has always bugged me. What a crappy engineering design - or they do it on purpose so you waste half the roll of tape and have to buy more.... For the past two months i've been getting the dreaded ""Cut Error"" that happens no matter how fast or slow I cut. I mean come on - why the heck do they even put this error in the labeler in the first place? If the label doesn't cut it will be obvious, then I'll use scissors... Today after 25 to 30 cut errors in a row in a fit of rage I spiked the labeler into the tile floor as hard as I could, then stomped on it. I've had enough of this POS labeler. I've dumped all 1000 pieces in the trash. My desk top labeler never had these problems, so thats what I'll use from now on - even though it still wastes tape with that long front tag end."
4,Good,It's a good product and the instructions make it easy to work with. I carry it where ever I go.
3,Nice Label Maker but Wasteful..,"The Brother PT-1400 P-Touch Handheld Labeler is a very good label maker but also very inefficient when it comes to tape usage. This unit is versitile, mobile, and it offers several different fonts and label types. There are also different tape sizes and different print/background colors available to satisfy most any need. It operates on six AA size batteries. The only problem I see with this machine is that it forces the user to cut off 1/2 inch of perfectly good tape between each label. Depending on how many labels you make, you end up wasting a fair amount of tape. I have no doubt this is a flaw by design to allow Brother to sell more tape cartridges. Very reliable product but extremely wasteful.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,Great Except for Cutter Errors.,"This is a very handy labeler with all sorts of different uses. But the 'Cutter Error' problem that so many have reported, just got to be too much and I threw the labeler in the trash. Such a bummer. I tried cleaning the cutter mechanism and holding it just right. Nothing worked. So I recently bought the PT-2730 only to find that it only does straight labels. No flag labels or port labels. Maybe I'm missing something, but if not, I've wasted $80 bucks. I've got to find a labeler that does cables, ports, vertical print etc.But for the 'Cutter Error' alone, I'd stay away from this one."
3,"Good, but CUTTER ERRORs frustrate and waste labels","I've been using the PRO version for about a year. The labels are great for general items but I'm not satisfied with the flexible labels that are used to wrap around wires. Problem is that the clear lamination starts to peel off over time. But the biggest problem, and one that has me looking for a replacement is the endless number of Cutter Errors that force you to reprint the entire label. You type in the entire text for your label, then press print. The unit pushes out about a half-inch of tape and you are supposed to press the cutter button. My unit fails about 25% of the time, so I have to eject the partial label and reprint. EXTREMELY frustrating! I called Brother and they said my unit was over 12 months old and there was nothing they could do. Seems to me that they know about this problem and are laughing at all of the owners as we buy more and more tape to cover the waste of the cutter error. I will look elsewhere for my next label maker."
1,"If you enjoy wasting Label tape, this is the labeler for you.","Sure this Labeler does create labels, I use it daily at work. A few issues though, Like other reviewers have stated, this Labeler forces you to waste tape, about a half inch for every label. This is ridiculous, i've used other Labelers that have worked absolutely fine and have created the same labels as this without the need to throw your money in the garbage. The cutter error! is hilarious...it's almost like it's yelling at you.Don't make the P-Touch angry, it might waste some more tape on you!This thing wastes so much tape in fact, you may find yourself creating labels smaller than the wasted tape.Keep buying the tape rolls so you can throw a quarter of it in the garbage.Look elsewhere, there are other Labelers out there that will not take their anger out on you by wasting materials."
1,this is the worst waste,"This machine wastes tape every label. it requires that you manually cut 1/2 inch of tape before each label, and shows a ""cutter error"" that wastes even more tape! it's totally annoying already to manually cut but worse that it will cost twice as much for tape to make up for the losses etc. YUCK NO THANKS. This unit is used at my office, i personally use a p touch desktop model with auto cut.. much much better and no tape wasted."
2,Merely OK,I bought this labeler because it has a number pad and I need to make labels with alot of numbers. I didn't realize the number pad would be so hard to reach. This thing is huge. Nine inches tall. It's hard to reach all of the buttons with out shifting your hands. This makes typing slow. The buttons have a very mushy feel. The code button is in the wrong spot. The letters on the buttons are white and the symbols next to the letters are yellow. This makes the letters hard to distinguish. The letters aren't in a qwerty format. So you'll have to learn the letter placement if you plan on using it alot. I can only recommend buying this if you'll be typing nothing but numbers.
1,NOT!!! User friendly at all,"I bought this label maker so that I can organize my office, home and stable & tack room. It is ""not""user friendly at all and that is all I can say is that I have become so frustrated getting it to work as it says that it does that I am giving it away and looking for a ""NEW"" one and what a ""BIG"" waste of money!!!"
1,CUT ERROR,"Its a great labeler...when its working!When its not working ( and that happens a lot!) it will give you endless ""Cut Error"" messages and with each message, it will waste your expensive tape.I got a record of 26 ""cut errors"", and with each message a piece o tape was wasted. I checked the batteries, the label, the position of the labeler, the alignment of the stars...nothing helped, I guess its just a flawed machine period.If you purchase this labeler, make sure you stock up with tapes...and patience.My advice: don't even think of buying this expensive tape waster."
4,Solid but wasteful,"This is a solid and useful labeler. It's sturdy and obviously built for industrial use and it is ridiculously easy to use. Sadly, it is also a bit wasteful, which is my only serious gripe with it. You see, every time you make a new label you are asked to cut a piece of tape about 3/4 of an inch before the label pops out. Perhaps the thinking was that since this is an industrial strength label machine, many labels would be entered in one shot so the 3/4 inch cut would occur only in the beginning of a massive print run. Or maybe Brother was slightly less than competent in designing this with economy in mind. Or maybe they planned on selling lots of tape. I have no idea why it makes that cut, but it is annoying.Aside from the wasting of tape it is a workhorse and it is very well built, so if you need an industrial strength labeling machine, this one will do nicely."
3,Makes decent labels except for wires and cables,"I have been using this unit for about 2 years now, and there are two things that I can not get past. Using the keyboard is horrible due to the A to Z layout. A QWERTY board would have been 1000 times better. I have used a variety of labels, and even the flexible ones uncurl off the wires after a month or two. Not good for labelling wires. Great for office items."
2,We read it is high school.,"It was a few years ago, forgot what it was about. It was free, thank you, but it is not very uplifting. Depressing I would call it. I deleted it already."
1,I never got it,"Ordered this for my Kindle but it has never come through. It was a free download, but since I have a 50 yr-old copy of the novel I didn't bother to pursue the issue."
2,This Book is entirely in Spanish!!!,"A word to the wise...the description states Spanish/English, but it is entirely in Spanish. I'm sending mine back!"
5,A practical approach,"The 2nd edition offers a very upto date, practical approach to OOAD. It is comprehensive yet still accessible. It is an ideal course book offering clear explanations which are not clouded by excessive terminology."
5,Best connection of OO theory to practice I've ever seen,"Although the author makes it clear that his intention is NOT to try to teach the One True Way, I would argue that this book is more about *process* than UML or patterns...and therein lies its value to me. After years of muddling through analysis, design, and coding I finally understand the boundaries of these phases in terms of the artifacts each phase should produce (in object oriented development). I can't recommend this book highly enough."
3,"decent overview of OO development process, UML, and patterns","I appear to be somewhat less optimistic about this book than other reviewers. In general, I thought it didn't do enough justice to any one of the three topics I listed above (OO development processes, UML, design patterns). Some UML notation features are barely mentioned until the last section of the book; and then they are just very briefly mentioned. I found the first three parts of the book somewhat lacking in substance. The patterns section (a relatively small portion of the book) was quite useful."
2,Very basic. Not for the advanced consultant/programmer,This book is good and has a solid case study. But it is not taylored towards an intermediate to advanced programmer/OO designer. It is great for a beginner but thats about it. Doesn't go about any implementation (what I mean is - creating the design using a tool such as Rational Rose or TogetherJ) which is what a lot of beginners are looking for.
4,Excellent Book,"This was an excellent book for classroom use. It is a useful not only as a learning tool, but as a reference as well. This is a book that will probably remain on my bookshelf for a while.The only complaint I have is that sometimes material may be difficult to find. Some terms are not included in the index that should have been. But these terms are few and far between, and do not take away from the overall excellence of the book."
5,Excellent introduction to UML,There are two books that I used at Uni and are now on my desk at work and get used regularly. This is one of them.Chapter 38 - 'Persistent frameworks' was the most influential.From this chapter I have built a persistent framework that auto generates appox 80 of my code and forms.My only complaint was that it took some time to track down further information on the unresolved issues. Thankfully the author emailed me some useful leads.I am looking forward to his next book &#65533;Applying Design Patterns in C#&#65533;...
5,A must read for those new to OOAD and iterative development,I am new to Iterative development as well as to design in the OOAD perspective. I found this book to be very helpful enabling me to grasp the design concepts.These concepts were introduced very well and provides a pretty systematic approach to design. A book worth having in any person's/organization's (interested in OOAD) library.
1,Terrible,Very wordy with lots of repetitive charts. Has plenty of deffinitions but is a terrible book overall. For UML try Beginning Java Objects or UML Distilled or Object Oriented Design Hueristics. What a bad pook this is with few and boring examples. Completely uninteresting and unimaginative.
1,Very disappointed,"I was looking for a book on the UML and this book was not it. The subtitle was much more descriptive of the content than the title. The title was very misleading. The book was a very detailed introduction to OOA/D, with minimal descriptions of UML scattered throughout each section. IMO, the writing style was much more complicated than it needed to be--the book didn't have a clear flow; rather, it seemed to jump around and repeat a lot. I'm returning this book now, and I will start looking for a better book on the UML. I'm glad I only wasted 2 weeks reading this one."
3,Cpr E 486,This text book was an average textbook. The subject that it is presenting is a difficult one to describe but I think that it could still do a better job doing that. It does however have a lot of helpful visuals and describes them well in the text. Also the Sales cash register example that is used throughout the book is a simple one to understand since most people have experience with cash registers yet it is complex enough that it can be used to describe pretty much all of the material. Some of the text was a little hard to follow however especially in the descriptions of the different GRASP patterns.
2,Far from the real world...,"I was not able to learn what to apply, why and where - from this book. Maybe the development cycle is to be followed indeed as presented in the book. But why... it's not clear. How do the needs of the development translate into methodologies, good practices? Why follow this way and not the other? These are important questions left unanswered. Going UML in contrast with older analysis methods and languages should bring a plus - what will it help gain, what to avoid? (which I was to find out later on, unfortunately not due to this book). Instead, a baroque demonstration of scholarly correct style, an example of cheese-smiling perfect development cycle. Which is not the case in the real world... Contingency plans, balanced approaches, tackling strategies - save the day. The principles behind should have been explained first."
4,Good Book,This book has greatly enhanced classroom learning on the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and the Unified Process. I have frequently used this book as a reference. It has many good examples that make it much easier to understand. It is well organized and easy to find the needed information on most OOAD related topics.
4,This is a great book.,"This has been my most used book this semester. It is a must have for any software engineer. I will not be selling this book back. The pace is very good, as well has great references on the inside covers."
4,A good textbook for learning the Unified Process,"This book introduced the concepts of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design in a very iterative and clear way just like the Unified Process itself.FURPS+ requirements, GRASP design patterns, GoF design patterns, architectural patterns, and many other OOA/D principles where detailed and then implemented in this book with very concrete examples using the Universal Modeling Language.The author does a very good job of breaking down and explaining the many examples of UML artifacts(diagrams, use-cases, etc.) created during the Inception and Elaboration phases of the development cycle.The one thing I found missing in this book was an appendix. I felt it would have been easier to follow if the author used an appendix with the artifacts of his POS after each iteration."
4,Great Diagrams,This book is packed with useful and insightful diagrams that really help to get their point across. I have found this to be a great book for getting a good understanding of UML and OOA/D. I also liked the information on the Gang of Four patterns. The only drawback I found with this book is that it doesn't hold up well when subjected to water.
4,Pretty Readable For A Textbook,"I read Larman's Applying UML And Patterns in my software engineering course at university. Some good points about the text: it was very readable, there were many helpful examples and diagrams, and it showed the UP for one example (the point-of-sale system) rather than several unrelated examples. I think many students are able to relate to the POS system example due to the large percentage of us working retail jobs.Some negatives are that sometimes the prose rambles a bit or it seems like the author wrote it during a very late night. Also I would have liked more comparisons between the many (and sometimes confusing) diagrams in UML.Overall, I thought this book did a great job teaching the reader about UML diagrams, software patterns, and the many iterations of the UP."
1,"padded, little content unless you are swayed by verbosity","Save your money. Buy Schaum's Outline's UML for around $14. At least it will have some content. Another good book is UML by Muller.Larman, Booch and Fowler are famous for padding books."
2,Did not meet my needs at all,"I was looking for a book which would quickly bring me through object-oriented design and allow me to get up to speed on UML. Instead, this book assumes you have NO previous knowledge in systems and maybe in computers at all. Without the aid of an instructor to translate and bring out the important parts of the book, I got lost in the extreme basics and was not able to pull out the parts I needed.No doubt a good book for beginners, but not for experienced systems analysts."
5,The one for me,"It's the handest shaver ever. I'm 80 years old. That's it,enough said. Remington was stupid for removing it from store shelves."
3,Battery operated,My husband used this for about a year and then it didn't shave well after that. You can't buy replacement heads so it's basically a throw away item. It's good for an overnite kit but you really need a full blown razor for serious shaving.
1,POOR QUALITY - SHORT LIFE,"Due to poor design and manufacturing, the blades cut through the built-in foil retaining (plastic) clips on the removable foil after only about 2 months of use; causing the foil to come loose."
3,just gets the job done,Remington the shavers not to bad. does irritate now but many say electric shavers need to grow on you so still waiting for it to not burn but gets the job done
3,Good for the $,"I have a very coarse beard and this gave me a close shave. Not sure why people are saying ""it doesnt work"". If you are cutting stubble it will workjust fine. If you have long hairs, cut them with a trimmer first. No shaver will cut hair that cannot enter the foil.The foil guard doesn't snap on securely. Not a big deal but should you really need to use a rubber band to hold the cover on a brand new shaver? Come on.I prefer the way the little Panasonic feels in the hand. Its heavier and fits nicely into the palm and you can also wash it. All in all, for $10.00 I have no regrets. :)"
2,I really don't like this,"I bought this to try out electric shaving but I think this is sort of a poor excuse of a shaver. I don't grow much facial hair and this thing still can't really shave properly. I don't see why everyone in these reviews are raving about this shaver, it hardly does anything."
1,Doesn't work well,"Bought this for my husband and it didn't work well at all. He had to keep going over the same spots trying to get it to actually shave the hair. When it did shave, it did it in spots. So he had to go back over with a regular razor. Returned it."
3,Electric Razor,"I had high hopes for this razor. A razor that ran on two AA batteries with no need to charge anything just pop in a fresh set of batteries and you are good to go.First set back, its a throwaway, you can't replace the cutting foil or cutting blade. The cutting foil is riveted in and cannot be removed for replacement. When you shave with it it does a pretty good job except it misses a few hairs on my neck that it will not cut and they keep getting longer and will not cut. After two days I'm clean shaven except for these few stubborn hairs that keep getting longer. If it had a trimmer this would help.It is very good for a quick emergency shave but not good to take on vacation for shaving everyday as I did. As a spare shaver to use in a pinch its great. I gave it to my wife for shaving her legs and I haven't heard any complaints.Eddy"
5,"For the price , a great product","For its price (under 10 Dollars) this product performs great. The batter life is great. The shave is not as smooth as I would like, and have to repeat it over some areas ( such as chin and underneath jaw line) as I said this is just an extra when i'm too lazy to shave properly. Works great"
3,Remington battery razor,"It would get 5 stars if they sold replacement foils.Or, if they included a replacement foil, and charged an additional $2 at time of purchase."
4,Really great product,My husband really likes the Remmington razor. Previously he had a ShaveMan.The only thing he would have liked is if the new rezor had a pop out trimmer.
4,Remington MSC-140,"I had to replace my old Titanium Turbo razor that I bought some 8 years ago and I did't want to have to replace it with an expensive one. I searched around and came across this one, and for $10, it's a great little razor that I have used a lot in the 1 month that I've had it. An easy recommendation for anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a battery razor."
4,As good as one 5 times the price,"For what this is, at the price it is, I was extremely pleased with its performance. It is not at all as cheap looking or feeling as some shavers in the $60-80 range. Cleaning it after is a bit of a chore, but not surprising. This is ideal for travel, or if you just need a touch-up. I also purchased a more expensive (much more) Panasonic, and while I am pleased with it, it is only a little better than the Remington. Buy this one with confidence."
2,Had higher expectations,"Just used this for one week on vacation. Given the large size for a travel razor, and double foil, I expected a better shave.Will NOT trim any long hairs. I really wanted this to be a great purchase, but at least the price was low. I have a $2 tiny single foil that runs off a AAA battery that does as good of a job as this, but takes longer."
3,good back-up/travel shaver,Good shaver for travel/camping or as a back-up.But NO screen replacement is available.Dis-appointing feature.
1,Dangerous,"This shaver doesn't work well and all, but the horrifying thing about it is that the blades eat through the foil and cut your face, it is simply a dangerous item. I call on Amazon to remove item before it really hurts someone. I would rated lower but 1 star is as low as it gets."
2,Barely adequate,"Bought this as a light-weight travel shaver for a trip to India. Although noisy and a bit slow, it's OK for its low price -- except for long whiskers. When you travel you shave in bad light, and you miss some -- and once a whisker gets past a certain length this shaver can't find it. Runs right over those long hairs. OK for good light or for a couple of days, but that's all. (On the other hand, it did run for 3 weeks on one set of batteries and did the basic shaving adequately)."
4,travel shaver,I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LIKES IT.HE SAID IT IS GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP
1,This thing is useless,"This thing does not remove facial hair accept in spots, not worth 29 cents let alone 29 doallars. I got mine a lot cheaper thank goodness. But I recomment you pass this thing by. save your money its just not worth it."
1,cheap but low quality,"It's difficult to load batteries because of the tight space. First pair of batteries didn't work, but they work fine on my 15 years old Hitachi BM-5200. Another pair of new batteries worked, but very weak.The plastic body looks cheap."
3,Shaves MOST hair,The stubborn hairs it does not get no matter what you try with it. But for the price it is definitely worth it.
3,Decent for a backup.,"Let me start by saying that this is my first purchase of an electric razor.I read many positive reviews of this, and was hoping that this would replace my need to purchase manual blades. However, I found that this did not provide nearly a close enough shave to be appropriate for everyday use. It is good for traveling or for a backup at work or in your car, if you need a dry shave on the go. Also, if I forget to shave for a few days, it does a good job of shortening my beard to make my manual blade shaving easier.I guess my beard hair may be different than others, and it may provide a close enough shave for some to be a daily shaver. For me it is not, but for ten dollars it is worth a try."
4,Great travel electric razor,"This is a great travel electric razor. Cuts just as well as my plugin , rechargeable fullsized Remington. Runs off of 2 AA batteries. A little noisey but cuts well"
5,Great Item!,"I bought this for my son. He is serving our country in Iraq and water isn't always available for shaving so he found this travel razor that he can use. Because of it's inexpensive price he is not concerned if he loses it, it does a great job and it doesn't take up alot of room."
5,Great Little Shaver,This is a great little shaver to use between shaves. Works great. Batteries last. Shaves close.
5,Razor,"The small razor is a great buy, I bought two I like it so much I wanted to have a exra one if something happen to the other one . I have tryed most of the high priced razors and I like the Remington MSC-140 better than all others, it shaves closer and quicker."
3,OK Shave but great value,"I have 4 types of travel shavers, all run on AA batteries. Of the 4(Axis AX-1300, Remington Travel Shaver, Bell & Howell travel shaver,and Braun Travel shaver) the Remington gives the best shave. While not a great shave it is good for the price of the shaver It is a good value given the price. On the downside the on-off switch is poorly designed and I can't keep the cap on the shaver. Of the 4 this is the one I use the most. The Axis 1300 is used the least used and at 3x - 4x the price the poorest value."
5,Superb Shave & Great Value!,Best electric shave I've had in years (the twin foils/blades seem to really make a difference). And outstanding value. Plus usual Amazon great service and fast shipping!
2,Eh,"Not too impressed. Have to go over and over and over the same spot for a clean shave. I don't shave every day, so this might work better if you use it every day. Once the hairs are a little long, they just don't want to go inside the holes to get cut."
1,Classic Mediocrity,"A classic example of mediocrity. Yes it is dependable whining away without fail. Has an odd cutting action that seems to miss one day then hit the next because it likes only strong hard hairs, it slides over weaker hairs like they are not there. Slow! Takes too long to shave seems like it takes 5 to 10 minutes - after a while you will give up. I only use it since I spent my shaver budget and can't afford another. Why all the positive comments on this razer? Mine is not broken so I likely have a typical example of it and I don't believe that the positive comments come from real daily users."
1,Ehh,This shaver won't take anything off that is more than a couple millimeters. It really doesn't get very close even when there isn't much on your face. I suppose for $10 this is a fair product.
3,no replacement parts,"This shaver does perform adequately, but to my immense chagrin, the package stated that no replacement foils or blades are made for this model. It is a ""throw-away"" device. In fact, it even states on the package that it has an estimated lifespan of one year. Remington's honesty in this instance is commendable, but it nothing to allay my annoyance that in this day and age of economic turmoil, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, short-lifespan devices like this are still being made. Most of them will be discarded in landfills, where whatever toxic materials contained within will eventually leak into the water table. This is too high a price to pay in the long run for a little short-term convenience."
1,"Worthless, worthless, worthless","Absolute waste of money. I bought this for my 13-year-old as a beginner shaver and it shaves next to nothing! I don't know who wrote the other reviews, but I doubt they were independent voices. This shaver is worthless!"
2,Not that great at all,The product kind of sucks. It doesn't provide a clean shave and if you have a lot of facial hair it is practically useless plus it's only good for people who keeps a regularly shaving but it still doesn't give that smooth shave that is wanted. No doubt a waste of money
3,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE,THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED IN LESS THAN GIFT CONDITION. I WROTE TO THE COMPANY AND THEY APOLOGIZED AND REFUNDED THE TOTAL AMOUNT (price & shipping) THE NEXT DAY.I AM UNABLE TO REVIEW THE ITEM AT THIS TIME SO I GAVE IT A THREE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTINUE WITH THE REVIEW UNTIL YOU RATE THE PRODUCT - A SILLY AMAZON REQUIREMENT THAT SKEWS PRODUCT RATINGS... MAYBE THEY SHOULD ADJUST THEIR SOFTWARE.
2,"The heroine is a spoiled little girl, unrealistic plot","The fundamental problem with this book is that it is completely incomprehensible to me why the hero would be in love with this heroine. She is a spoiled, pampered heiress and he pays for her college tuition - for voice lessons? Really? Essentially, he is her sugar daddy. There is nothing attractive about the heroine and I kept reading it thinking, ""Oh,she's going to show soon, please soon, why such a great guy has put his faith and love in her"". Alas no. There are lots of romance novels out there where the heroine is 15 or 20 years younger than the man, but in most of these, the author at least attempts to show that the lady has redeeming character traits, apart from her youthful appearance. At least lulling us into the pretense that the older guy isn't just in it for the sex."
5,I Enjoyed It!,I agree with the previous reader..i like her older books like Kiss Yesterday Goodbye. Leaving Home is a wonderful love story between two friends.
2,Too little detail,"The book was pretty good overall. It offered a wide variety of information. Just like a survey course, however, she glosses over certain parts. For example, she talks about different types of insurance while mentioning, but not defining, a deductible. Other sections of the book seem scattered and unorganized."
5,"ALL bathrooms need a urinal, says wife!","I've had urinals in the last two houses. Two in this one and one more coming (for the mancave). They are in the fancy, decorator-style bathrooms along with a bidet and Jacuzzi. The Sloan valves are way cool: Triple chromed solid brass, and totally retro. Fits in well with our wall hung toilets (easy cleaning and no scuzzy grout). My wife (and I of course) love urinals. No sniveling about the seat left up, and no need to lift it up either. Her friends at first are snippy, then become enthusiastic believers when they realize the benefits, including the absence of drippies on the floor. I plumbed mine with 3/4"" supply pipe as recommended. (Sloans need their water, right now, to affect a siphon in the trap.) A 1/2"" feed might work. Try it if it already exists; but for new, use 3/4""."
1,Daniel Radcliffe Biography,I bought this book thinking something that when I got it the book wasn't what I thought and I sent it back. It is not an official Biography about his life from birth to now. It had nothing that I didn't know already. One picture of a man and woman was presented as his parents. They are not his parents. The woman is his publisist not his mum.
1,Lousy commentary,"This book is neither accurate nor informative. Anyone could have written this from press clippings and while that is possible, it would also be wrong. That is not a picture of his mother. As I have no idea what his father looks like, I can't say. Also, Daniel's name is wrong and I highly discourage anyone from spending money for this rubbish!"
4,My son loves this gym,"This is a great way to keep your baby occupied and get some exercise. My son loves the kick pad and grabbing the hanging toys. The ""silly"" setting is the best to encourage him to keep kicking. And, it fits perfectly in our pack n' play, so I don't have to worry about him being on the floor if other things are going on."
2,not very safe,"I got this play mat as a gift for my daughter and she loves it, she likes the lights and the music. It does eat a lot of batteries, but I bought rechargeable batteries for it since she likes it so much. This morning her hand got stuck in the red spinning toy and I even had trouble getting it out. I will let her continue to play on the mat, but not with that (her favorite) toy."
3,Disappointed,"My son does love this gymmat, but only after i changed the layout of the toys so he could actually play with them.I don't see how a child can hit the footrest, and also play with the toys at arm level. In fact to reach the arm toys his head would have to be off the mat. I ended up taking all the hooks and linking them across (like a clothesline), and hanging the toys off that. So a good toy, but you need to tweak it a bit. In my opinion, there are probably other gyms that are better straight out of the box. For the price, it should be functional out of the box."
2,"Good quality, Oversized","I bought this product a couple of years ago and I didn't wear it much after receiving it. Mostly this was just because the size was huge compared to other shirts of the same size I've normally bought. The quality was good however, and my friend that I graciously gave it to loved it."
2,Roseville Art Pottery 2003 1/2 Price Guide Volume V,"I have collected American Art pottery for five years. While this book has a ""niche,"" its scope is too limited for my needs. The price guide is useful; however, it is often limited to certain colors, such as blue Magnolia or green Baneda, and ignores other colors. There are two picture galleries (Wisteria and Tuscany) and one small gallery of experimental glazes. Other Roseville product lines are not shown. Historical information is limited. For example, the discussion of Frank Ferrell is short on facts, dates, and product lines and long on the author's personal observations and impressions. Since I purchased volume V, I suppose that volumes I-IV have a similar format, as will subsequent volumes. Given that Roseville Pottery produced over 90 product lines, often with three colors, a Roseville collector would have to purchase multiple volumes ($21.95 each) to amass a comprehensive set of reference materials. For my money, that just does not add up."
5,Convenient and easy to use,"I was looking for a watering can that would create a gentle shower. This can does that. Unlike cheap cans, this one has a rose with very small holes that creates a soft shower pattern instead of a few strong streams that just dig holes in the garden. The long spout is useful as well because you can more accurately aim the water without having to bend closer to the ground."
2,AVOID!!!,".... Unless you like you want to pay big $$$ for a plastic water-can that feels just like the 5$ one at walmart. It does water ""delicately"" for lack of a better term. But for the $$$... no thank-you. Mine has cracked in 2 different places and the cheap plastic accesories are always falling off. One more super glue ""fix"" and it will be thrown away."
5,very neat,It has a great long spout that deposits the water very accurately. There are never splashes beyond the intended target.
5,excellent for the money,"I have been on the lookout for an affordable way to water my Bonsai's now for a while. You can spend in excess of $200.00 for a copper, small volume waterer if you like. It too has a fine rose and a long neck. This 1.5 liter heavy plastic watering can from Hawes is awesome and very much appeals to my sense of budget. My trees are unable to tell the difference in this and a $200.00 one, but my wallet wallet sure can. The brass rose is as fine as the far more expensive ones and the watering is soft and complete and everything the $200.00 one is except expensive. It is very thick plastic, holds a fair amount, has an easy grip handle and anti-slosh top to keep water in the can. I find it a joy to use, and fine waterer and unbeatable for the money. I could go on singing this things praises, but I think you get the idea. I love itPhillip Chancey"
2,Outdated,The book deals with real problems faced by real people BEFORE the introduction of modern insulin pumps. The pump solves many if not most problems discussed in the book.
1,Not for toddlers,"Cute concept ... way too wordy and cumbersome to read to a small toddler. Story is also boring. Good pictures ... this is really a book for beginning readers who are practicing phonics NOT a fun book for toddlers. Also, the story is quite boring."
5,funny book,My 5-year-old boy enjoys this story. He laughs at the frog falling off the log. It is a good book for him to practice sounding out words.
2,"Boring, cumbersome to read, not for toddlers","My toddler son is obsessed with frogs. Fortunately I checked this book out from the library and didn't buy it. My son likes the flaps that open, and the different animals.Perhaps this book is just for new readers. However, there is one page that seems like poor grammar, it says ""Next day, it is sunny."" It seems like it should be ""The next day it is sunny."" I am not an English major, so perhaps the way the book is written is acceptable, but it doesn't look right."
5,Worked perfectly!,Received this product very quickly and was able to install it easily. This was an OEM replacement for my Passat and has been working perfectly since I installed it. NO MORE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT!
1,Not that good,"I am reading this book, I spent three years in Iraq and came back a bit rattled, I am watching many of my friends' lives fall apart... My main way of coping has been hiding...I do not like some of the descriptions in this book, trying to make them funny or silly like dinosaur dump or wild ride- that does not describe the terror I feel every time I hear a siren or a door slam- I also feel that concepts are crammed in the book but no real 'action plans' are given ""get though the anger to vulnerability""- I cant understand what that means....OK book but really, I do wish I did not read these 'great' reviews as I am not seeing them as valid.The author does not have a real picture of a war zone or the horrors that go with that, that is very clear- I dont get a sense of 'understanding' and I cant relate to much of what she is saying."
2,An Operators Manual for PTSD,"A bit too much pscho-babbble for the average vet. I got this for my son, who I know will read the first few pages, and never pick it up again."
5,If you like SuperEuroBeat,"A great collection of almost all your favorite super euro beat songs from the awesome anime show and a few you probably don't remember hearing. A great collection, but there are only so many hours you can listen to it before you will need to take a break and hear something else."
4,Ahh. The second World War. A boon for mystery writers,Patricia Wentworth is one of the 'Classic English Murder' writers. This is one of her best. Miss Silver and her peculiarities does not intrude too much and the main characters are appealing. The mystery and resolution is satifying.
4,Glad to see it was to be continued....,"I'm finding myself getting more and more into the books I read by Patricia Scanlan. This book is based in the early - mid sixties, but to me read more like it was the forties, about the women in an extended family, Miriam, Ellen, Emma, and Sheila. The focus of the story changes a lot from one character to the other, but each is interesting enough to carry the story in my opinion.Sheila is the matriarch, and the stubborn, bossy mother who likes to have her say in the family and what goes on.Miriam married the younger son in the family; she's a mother by nature as well as a push over.Emma married the older brother and is also a judges daughter from the big city, she's a spoiled brat and n o one will change that.Ellen is the boys' only sister, she is Miriam's best friend and a little bit of a free spirit.Over the years the girls cause drama and have children of their own...it's a very fun story to read!"
2,Disappointing,"Lousy! Was promising at the beginning with stories about Miriam and Emma. The plot becomes stagnant as it dwells on the Ellen/Chris/Suzy love triangle. The author fails to convince me that Chris is ""the love of Ellen's life"", more like the lust of her life, afterall, Chris was not the one who introduced orgasm to Ellen and during their courtship, if one can call that courtship at all with Chris described to be one who couldn't careless about Ellen and always fails to keep his promises to call/see Ellen. There was nothing romantic or larger than life in their relationship for it to be termed""the love of her life"". The story indeed becomes boring and lifeless soon after Chris broke up with Ellen after knowing the latter's pregnancy, which is only about 1/4 through the novel. It was a drag and an effort to read after that! I've read that Scanlan is compared to Maeve Binchy, no way! At least not as far as this novel is concerned. I haven't read her other books and doubt if I would."
5,De-stress. Be a child for awhile and have FUN FUN FUN!,"This is one of the most upbeat, creative collections of FUN I've ever had the pleasure to read. Suggestions such as ""Sing at the Top of Your Lungs,"" ""Play in the Dirt,"" and ""Cry Over Spilled Milk"" remind us that there's more to life than being mature and responsible, a little letting go can go a long way. Along with each suggestion comes author Leslie Levine's witty commentary as well as quotes from some favorite contemporary novelists. Ice Cream is poignant primer on countering life's little trials, tragedies, and tribulations!"
5,A Delightful Read,"The perfect book for a gift to your very favorite people...Ice Cream for Breakfast is a delightful and inspired read for all ages. It is a insiteful guide to ""breaking the rules"" in a constructive and growth-orientated manner and is charmingly written and beautifully illustrated.I plan to buy many and give them to all my friends!"
5,Thoughtful concepts,Easy reading and thought provoking concepts. It takes you outside yourself and questions simple concepts you take for granted. You will enjoy... Bob
5,Amazing,"My 6 year old child, who is easily distracted, can't get enough of this movie! Educational and entertaining. He asks about caterpillars and praying mantis all the time now. Amazing shots of the bugs"
3,Alright,"The bugs were huge, kind of scared my 2 year old. My bug loving kids were very excited to watch this but they got bored about 10 minutes into this show. I found it interesting, but it didn't impress my 2 and 6 year old"
3,"Disappointing. Not a happy ""adventure"" for children!","While this film is beautiful and informative, the storyline is, to quote my 7 year old, ""Lame!!"" Both my 5 and 7 year old, who love insect and bug movies/documentaries and haven't had trouble in the past when insects die, ended this movie weeping and angry. The story follows a butterfly and a praying mantis from birth to maturity, calling them by name and going through all of the dangers and developments they face. After all of it, they choose to end it with the mantis eating the butterfly. The butterfly wings float down together and land in the stream and float off. Artistic it was. Maybe that's nice for adults, but I would have liked a little warning before watching it with my kids."
3,"Nice Production, but nothing fascinating","It has been nicely prepared. Images are wonderful. However, once you watchMicrocosmosandLife in the UndergrowthBugs! can only be classified as ""honorable mention"" or even lower. The picture quality and quality of work is probably perfect but end result is not enough for fascinating the viewers -seen the competition. In my opinion, the purpose of the film was not clear neither (was it: filming the insects as close as possible without any filming patterns or telling a story of a butterfly?). So, I give 3-stars only for the efforts and meticoulous film production."
1,My 4 yr old was crying in a ball,"I agree with the reviewer above, Elizabeth. My son loves bugs. He's obsessed. He can't get enough bug movies... but this one is going in the vault with Star Wars until he's older. He came down the stairs crying his eyes out that the praying mantis ate the butterfly. And what makes it worse... they give the two insects names, so my son fell in love with them both. ""He ate Peeo! He ate Peeo!!! Mom!!!!"" Then we went into a discussion about the cycle of life, death, etc. -- all I wanted was 45 minutes of mommy time, not a philosophy lesson with my toddler."
5,Delightful. insightful ...,"Delightful, insightful, witty and charming. In the style of Fulghum and Trillin ... Max Israelite is one of those gifted people that can take an everyday incident and find the pathos or humor. Combine that with a fine storytelling flair and it conjures up the kind of person I (we all?) wish we would find sitting next to us at a dinner party . I never met author but hope to ...in the meantime I suggest this book for those long plane rides or a rainy weekend. This book travels to new readers (I imagine) mostly by word of mouth. It was suggested (to me) by a client. In keeping with the obligation of karma... I pass on this uncommon little volume."
3,Captures your attention!,"Young, ambitious and good-hearted Niall Currie is wrongly imprisoned and held in Newgate Prison, where he suffers horribly. Bent on vengeance, he kidnaps beautiful Fiona as part of his revenge plot and whisks her off to an island off Scotland, where they take refuge in a crumbling manor.The story has a touch of magic, as Fiona is a seer. And there's a delightful and intriguing mystery to unravel that has a fairly surprising twist.I liked this story a lot more than I expected to, and was delighted in the love between the hero and heroine. The love scenes were passionate and the plot keeps a good pace. Any major complaint would be the abrupt ending, but I was sated enough with the way it wrapped up.The time setting is fairly vague, however. It feels gothic and old, but is supposed to take place in the nearly 19th century. Even still, a recommended tale!"
2,finish didn't last a year,The chrome finish is irreparably oxidized and mottled after less than 8 months of use. See my photo above. Don't waste your money.
4,fits my plate,the plate frame is thin fits around my license plate. It did not come with chrome screws but it is still doable.
2,"Decent quality, but won't fit on a 2005 Acura TL","While my Texas license plates fit inside the frame (seemingly contrary to some of the other reviews here), the top holes do not line up with the holes on my trunk. Basically, I can't physically run two screws/bolts through the top holes because the eyelets are too far away from the top of the license plate. I will upload a picture to the product picture gallery for clarity.Bottom line: do not buy this if you own an Acura TL (unless you want to use it for the front license plate)!"
3,It is as described,It is what they say it is however I guess I wanted more...I thought it would have a little more flair but it is fairly dainty and gives asmall frame around the plate..doesn't cover the plate though and I guess that is the point!
2,Cheaply-made,"The frames look fine, though they are very narrow and barely noticeable for my taste. They look almost as if though you don't have any frame at all.My biggest complaint about them, however, is that they are packaged with only 2 screws! I ended up attaching them to the car (front and back) with only the top screws available. It was simply too much of a hassle to return the 2 frames I bought. However, this makes the frames more flimsy and less attractive - the holes are there, but the screws are missing. So now I am going to have to shop around to find the matching screws to add at the bottom, which is also a hassle. In short, I wish the manufacturer didn't skimp out on something as small and inexpensive as 2 extra screws!"
1,Cruiser plate cover,"This item shipped defective. Parts not covered with chrome are rusting. This is usually a good product, I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem. I need to have these two plates replaced."
5,Nice value and classy product!,"First of all, this is made well and looks attractive and durable, looks like it is chrome! Secondly, if you want a REALLY awesome tag cover that will not advertise the place you purchased your vehicle, this is a classy way to do it! I think it is tacky that most dealerships think it is OK to advertise their dealership for free on your license plate area. Therefore, this low cost item can replace whatever the dealer placed on your car. This is a tasteful, understated example of what you can put in that area in lieu of giving the dealership free advertising! Why should the world know where I bought my car from!"
4,Slight clatter when closing the trunk,"This review is for the California License plate on an Acura RLLet me first say, this frame is a very good quality. Very strong, doesn't even want to twist. It also has some good weight on it. I also like the fact that it doesn't cover up any part of the license plate, this is especially good when you have those personalize license plates.The only downside I found is that when I close the trunk, it makes a slight metal to metal clatter with the license plate. I even put all 4 bolts to minimize any kind of noise. A simple fix would be to add a foam strip at the edge where it clatters. The noise is not a big deal, you can hardly hear it when you are slamming the trunk.Summary:PROS:-Good quality, very strong-Doesn't cover any part of the plateCONS:-Slight metal to metal sound when closing the trunk. Can be fixed with some tiny foam in the back to deaden the sound.I just might get one for the front of the car for this price! AWESOME!"
2,Author lacks in-depth knowledge of his subject,"If you are new to Corvettes and restoring them, beware that the author probably has little better knowledge than you do on the subject other than going through one project himself, which hardly makes anyone an expert.If you are not new to them, you don't need this book.The book is filled with: dubious, almost flippant advice ""..the softest possible (suspension) spring should be the best""; blatant omissions (discusses the merits of numbers-matching 'vettes but doesn't even mention the multitude of fraudulently stamped motors in the market; and incorrect statements ""As horsepower and rpms increase, torque decreases.""The book does have good pictures and diagrams, just be careful reading it."
4,Umbria: Regional Recipes - the closest thing to being there,"Having just returned from eating our way through Umbria and Tuscany this book was like reliving everything we'd experienced. The recipes were simple, fresh and filling. the photography and text captured the essence of Umbria completely. A joy of a cookbook for those who enjoy cooking with fresh, healthy ingredients."
4,Umbria:Regional Recipes from the Heartland of Italy,"I had recently been to Umbria and loved the food so I searched for a cookbook about Umbrian food. There are very few available, but this one is good. The recipes do seem authentic and there are nice photos to go with the recipes."
2,Made in China,"With a name like Union Tools, I thought that this was made in USA. I was wrong. It is made in China. Also, while the finish has aluminum look, it is not aluminum, and shovel is relatively heavy. While the design looks great, it does not function as anticipated. When I step squarely in the middle, my knee is in direct alignment with the pole, and so, my knee strikes the handle. NO, I would not buy it again."
5,Simple but effective,"I love Dara Torres and she's an inspiration! While she actual had trainers to provide resistance stretching, this is still an effective technique to do at home. The video quality is very poor - don't be surprised - but this workout gets the job done. If you want more details on Meridian Stretching, you can purchase the book by Bob Cooley. His first video was not very good, don't know about the second one."
1,Unusable,"This video gives a decent overview of what resistance stretching is but is unusable as an exercise guide. The ""workout routine"" does not give enough instruction nor does it give enough time to perform the exercises. It also doesn't have you switch to work the other side of your body so it is pretty worthless as an exercise tool."
1,Where is Dara? DVD Cover Misleading,"This is horrible! There are two DVDs in this set and I didn't even make it to the second one yet. The first one does not even have Dara in it, but two weird looking trainers: a chick that looks like a fullback and a skinny dude with platinum blond hair. They do not even do a stretch workout! They just talk about the moves and then do one lame example--there is no stretching workout or sequence on the first DVD! So booooring!!!!!!!!! They are both horrible on camera--no wonder they needed Dara to endorse it! Could not even watch past Chapter 3, because I was so disgusted."
2,TOO WEIRD FOR ME,"These stretches -- in one of them you lie on your back and grab your foot and push with your leg and resist with your arm -- just seemed strange to me. I tried one, and it hurt my back. I watched parts of the video and never really believed in it. Unfortunately, I didn't see any kind of notice about Amazon's return policy. But you only get a small refund and they don't pay for your shipping if there is nothing technically wrong with a DVD and you have opened it. So I spent $18 for the video and had to spend $9 to send it back, which totals $27. I complained and they gave me a refund of $13 or so, but the whole thing was unpleasant, time consuming and expensive. Sorry. I hate to bad-mouth anything to do with Dara Torres, but this didn't work out very well for me."
3,"Sorry Burt, Loni's book is better!","Okay, saw the book on the cheapo shelf at the bookstore so figured I'd read it. Only fair because I read Loni's book last year and was curious to read his version of events. Burt's book is good. I will say that, but, he has the biggest ego ever!! The book was entertaining at the beginning. I loved reading about his childhood and growing up years. Burt can be a very funny man. The parts I didn't like were when he started being snippy over Loni. How she spent hours putting her makeup on. How she wore a skimpy bikini around the poolman. (Why shouldn't she?) Loni never once put Burt down in any shape, form or manner in her book whereas Burt seemed to think it was okay to nitpick about her every chance he got. Burt, other than the low-blows you wrote about your ex-wife, the book was very entertaining. Please try to forget the past as Loni has and get on with your life!!"
4,BURT,This book was pretty good but I gave it 4 stars because Burt did not talk about his relationship with Tammy Wynette I read in Tammy's book about it and wanted to hear Burt's side.He does tell us a lot about the women that have passed through his life it was pretty interesting. I never would have thought Sally was so petty.and Loni was after money. I think the only woman who really loved Burt was Dinah Shore. I think maybe that was the only woman Burt really loved too.He tells us the age difference got in the way.He let other people put doubts in his head about Dinah he should of not listened to others but followed his heart.
5,Great read,"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. I thought it would be a lot about his football days, but it was mainly about his acting career and the women in his life. I would have liked to read more about Loni. I read this book after reading Loni's book, my life in high heels, of course they both blame the other for infidelity and breaking up the marriage, and I would think that they are both to blame. Burt acts like he was faithful to Loni throughout their romance, but in Loni's book, countless people told her he always had another girlfriend while he was dating Loni. But it was an interesting book and gives you an insight into the hollywood business."
5,Great fun to read! What a life he is having.,"I was lucky enough to be able to produce the audio book edition of Burt's autobiography (which is no longer available) and so I was very familiar with this book. It is one good read! If you like movies, especially if you've liked Burt's, you will love to read his story. One thing I like best, he holds nothing back...so you get to read all about his life and his women...."
2,Not what I thought,Bought these for my 2 yr old son - thought there would be some substance to them but they are actually paper thin magnets... not at all what I thought they were going to be.... disappointing.
2,It is labeled as Oneidacraft and not the same quality....,I purchased these since we often have guests over and I wanted a large set of silverware. Unfortunately it is not nearly the same weight or strength as our other Oneida silverware. It is actually labeled as Oneidacraft and does not even have the smoothness of our other silverware. The edges are not as rounded and do not have the strength needed for everyday use. I gave them two stars since they will work and they do have a lot of pieces. Please note that I did return the two sets and bought the regular Oneida instead.
1,DO NOT spend your money on this,It was shocking to see the silverware how bad it can be...AMAZON should not do this. This is not ONIEDA its Oniedacraft....The stuff is light weight and smaller then you would like it to be. The point it don't waste your money.
1,Too flimsy... Avoid if you want hefty dinnerware.,"I ordered this set to replace my current hodge-podge of everyday silverware. I was very disappointed in the quality of this set. I could bend the spoon with one hand. The edges are rough, and the set looks like it was stamped out of flat metal. I guess $30 will only go so far with tableware. Look elswhere unless these details are acceptable to you."
4,No color Photos!,"I guess that's putting it wrong..the color pictures are all on the front of the book. I gave this book as a gift to my mother, to inspire her to come visit me after having moved here this year. I figured that the pictures would really grab her attention. When i called to ask how she liked her gifts she replied , ""well it would have been nice if the pictures were in color."" *UGH* I felt mislead because nowhere in the description does it say that the photos are black and white...i know that the look inside the book pic are b&w but i assumed it would at least be half and half. I can't really give it a bad rating because i don't know yet if the information given is helpful or well written, but if you are looking for a scenic travel book this MAY not be for you."
2,Monstrous children lost in a jungle,"After reading Tokyo Fiance by the same author I was disappointed in this book. Not only the writing is choppy but the story does not really interest me, nor do the characters leave a lasting impression. There's nothing there to move you and although the children in this book are just as monstrous as the ones in Lord of the Flies the writing falls much shorter in comparison."
3,Classroom in a book great bginner,"If your a beginner with Adobe Photoshop elements, this book surpasses any thing that the manual tells you. There are lessons included on a CD DISC included which has you give you hands on work to use as you learn. A great asset for anyone wanting to use the full potential of photoshop elements."
2,Adobe Photoshop Elements4.0,I was not very happy because this book should of come with a cd to go along with the book. So I have no cd to work the classroom book. Not sure if the seller indicated that to me or not. I am waiting on an other book which to my surprise do not know why it is taking so long to arrive by mail. So the next time I order I will re-consider using another website or vendor to get what I need.
1,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 Classroom in book,The book arrived after 10 days but the CD-Rom is missing and I cant use the book without it. I have tried to ask for a copy of the CD-ROM with no joy.Could Adobe supply me with a copy.
2,Photoshop elements 4 classroom in a book,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 Classroom in a BookThis book is designed around a CD that was not included. If I had known that I would not have purchased this item.
4,A Good Way to Get Familiar with Elements 4.0,"I am still using this manual. So far, I do like it. What I like best are the detailed instructions on the Organizer segment of the program. I find that I am much more adept at keeping track of the pictures I take. I would never have done as well on my own by just ""exploring"" the program by trial and error. The Classroom book excels here.You have to be careful when following some of the editing instructions, and occasionally I got a little ""muddled"" and had to start over. Maybe I was just having some ""senior moments."" The processes relating to tagging and relocating pictures seemed unecessarily redundant at times.Nevertheless, it is a valuable manual and succeeds in preparing one for use on a program that is more complex than it seems at first blush. I do recommend it as a good ""starter"" edition."
1,PC only,it is not obvious that this is a PC version - If you use a mac like me don't get this one. look at the tiny print on the cover.
4,Pleased,This book is a work of art. Anyone loving this genre of Italian architecture should have this book. I found a used copy in decent condition. I am very pleased.
4,The Villas of Palladio,"De delivery was best. The price was reasonable, but the cover was missing of this book. This is the only thing that disappointed me."
4,Max Lucada - Three in One Collection,Very prompt delivery and book was in the condition that was stated. Very well pleased.
1,Disappointing,This is just a re-hash; they took an old (non-authoritative) version of Robert's Rules and added cartoons. The illustrations don't really add any meaningful value.
5,Absolutely a must have for all bodyworker students,"This book covered a wide area of massage, business start up, brochure, business card and all of the in-betweens. I would advise all students of massage therapy to get this book because it will not matter what modality you are about to embark into, this book will help you get there successfully."
5,more than just how to market massage,"i have been looking for someone to put these words in print for a VERY long time... anyone and everyone wno is even close to being in the field of bodywork MUST read this book... not only is it a guide for marketing massage, it is also a guide for how to simply be a massage professional."
4,"Good, but outdated","I really love going through this book periodically for inspiration for my business. However, I'd love to see an updated version that has current marketing issues in it (like websites, social networking, etc.)."
3,review of dvd,"fairly basic information on Ted Kaczynski, nothing really new from any other news sources.quick and simple viewing. expected more in depth life story."
5,Amazing Tutorial - Couldn't Recommend More Strongly,"I have to confess that I really didn't expect much in terms of video quality. Instead, I just wanted to learn a few tips and tricks about my new Zoom H4N and was willing to suffer through whatever poor video quality I would be confronted with. Wow!! Was I shocked. This is really an amazing video. In terms of content, the DVD very quickly introduces you to the basics of the Zoom H4N and then covers a number of tips, tricks and secrets found no where within the owners manual. But there's a bonus, the host, video and audio quality are better than many televised cable shows. Really first rate. Some videos you need to review time and again to get the information you need. Certainly, you'll want to watch this video over and over. However, the host and video do such a superb job that you'll be amazed at just how much you pick up during the first viewing. Again, I really can't recommend this video highly enough!"
1,Deceptive advertising,"The product is listed as 60 capsules with a 500mg dose, but each capsule is only 250mg. This is not advertised that you are only getting half of what you paid for."
3,I don't get it,"Why is this book so widely lauded? Sure, in some places it's quite insightful, but in others it seems to revise for revision's sake. In checking Salvatore's primary sources, some turn out to be quite vague, revealing what seem to me to be somewhat dubious conjecture in order to turn this or that assumption (especially regarding his early years) on its head, in favor of a more hypocritical portrait of Debs. Admittedly, I'm only an undergrad historian, so perhaps I'm merely not far enough along in my studies to grasp the nuances, but I have found that in doing my own research, I cannot rely on Salvatore's interpretations of Debs any more than I can the overly adulatory biopics of his predecessors. A frustrating situation, but hopefully useful in my development as a historian."
1,what's the word for not durable?,This device works great for about 10-20 uses. The bristles break down quickly. Its better to use an old full size brushhead and cut the out ring of bristles. This works much better.
3,"Strange, but useful.","I didn't realize that this was a much narrower head than the one that comes with the brush. It cleans well between teeth, but wears out quickly. I didn't like it."
4,"Organic, playful, enigmatic.","It's just as difficult to approach this album as Jazz work as one of Rock. It's neither, really, but nor does it deserve to be tossed off as post-rock or neo-prog. This predicament alone should send a flare signaling the creative skill of these musicians. They are able to construct melodic, endlessly listenable music that is challenging, intellectual, and unlike anything else being made today. Apart from the similar-minded Tortoise, Jim Black's arrangements never feel excessive or self indulgent. His efficiency is just as important as his virtuosity, the two elements feeding off of one another rather than struggling for dominance. In the end, the listener is left with the feeling that a secret has been shared, one as alarming as it is intimately comforting."
5,"""Bogus Bulldogs etc""","Only a crusty curmudgeon would not have his spirits lifted by spending several hours with this comical book.Sword swallowers!, Hatchet throwers!, Barrel dancers! Trapeze artists and ""Penelope Twing, The Voice of the Swing""!But all is not frivolity; a murder has been committed by a ""cunning enemy"".The pace is brisk, the repartee entertaining, and the mystery satisfyingly challenging to solve.This is not another banal detective story. Lovesey's dazzling description early in the book of a Victorian music hall performance is as vibrant and colorful as an Impressionistic painting and his witty account of a bobby questioning a stuttering suspect is just one instance of his great sense of fun.Peter Lovesey has won many writing awards and this book is one reason why."
1,Bite the hand that feeds you,"Liberal elites like Mr. Sperling fail to see that their misguided utopian views attack the very system of free market capitalism that allowed them amass insane amounts of wealth. They would have never come to exist under the system they espouse. We did not become the world's super-power through wealth redistribution programs, and rampant tolerance of an increasingly decadent lifestyle. We need more ""retro"" back to the core values of individual responsibility, fear of God, hard work, and strength through the traditional family."
1,"Same old,same old song and dance","It's the same old, tired drivel: class warfare and tons of social programs. That's how they plan to win back power. Time for a new playbook! Save your money, donate it to one of your wacko 527 groups or Greenpeace or something!!!!"
1,This book is trash,"Mr. Sperling does not have much of a grasp of reality or the democratic processs. The thesis of his book is inherently flawed. He is a divisionist himself and if I were a conservative I would hope the liberals would follow his ""advice"" - they would surely lose even more ground. Mr. Sperling refers to the South as retro America, apparently Mr. Sperling has not seen fit to travel south of the Mason-Dixon line to Atlanta (or any other Southern city) in quite sometime."
2,Charts and graphs don't make it right.,"It is often quipped that a ""Washington expert"" is no smarter than any other expert, he just has better slides. ""The Great Divide"" builds on this point. This is a shallow, superficial campaign book, not a serious study, that sells for nearly $40 to cover the costs of its multi-colored graphics. It purports to look seriously at subsidies while overlooking some of the largest and ignoring the fact that these subsidies are pushed with great enthusiasm by such Republican stalwarts as Tom Daschle, Kent Conrad, Tom Harkin, etc. It is a polemic or a diatribe. Save your money."
1,"John Kerry, PLEASE... follow these instructions!!!!!","This is a very interesting book to read. When you reduce all the elegant theories and observations, you find out that:- the South is based on the movie Deliverance.- The Dems are, for the most part, visionaries- the Republicans are, for the most part, evil manipulating orcs- Old-style Values are anachronistic- Fly-over states are so passe- Yada, Yada, YadaUse this as your guide Mr. Kerry...Karl Rowe will thank you for it."
1,Election Year McBook,"The ad blurb, ""retro"" vs ""metro,"" says it all -- a gimmick slogan tricked out to book length. Thoughtful people everywhere -- in ""red"" and ""blue"" states alike -- can and will disagree over issues that lie deeper than campaign broadsides or the personalities of the candidates: the proper role of government, whether we have, or want, a social safety net, the rights of individuals. The debate is as old as the Republic. Go buy the Federalist Papers - $7.95 on Amazon: a $32 dollar saving over this McBook."
4,Excellent book but . . .,"This is a fascinating, excellent book. But I do have some issues with it. I think the ""divide"" is a little more electoral, and a little less geographic. In most red or blue states, there is a majority of one ideology over the other, but it's not necessarily overwhelming. It's our silly, winner-take-all (or in the last election LOSER-take-all) electoral system that makes it appear so black and white (or red and blue).A. Runner, if you want to READ THE BOOK and WRITE A REVIEW, please do. But please don't clog up the reviews with long winded, ditto-headed, dissertations about your own self-important opinions. Write an editorial to the paper . . . or call your druggie hero and rant there. These are book reviews, NOT personal political forums."
3,All you need to do is read the reviews,"You don't need to read the whole book--read the reviews. The conservatives and liberals speak for themselves, and both make excellent points. The problem with this book is that it's self defeating. Sperling claims to be ""metro"" and outlines metro values, but does not do a good job practicing them. He has created encompassing, stereotyping labels for two groups who are themselves made up of a diverse number of smaller groups and pits them against each other. It's easy to find points of dissention. We need to begin by at least finding a few points of connection."
1,Trade Marked Junk Crystals & Rocks anyone?,"Watch out for the TRADE MARKED CRYSTALS!!!!I have done repeated searches of the stones listed in books by this author. I have read extensively in the mineral forums on just what these stones are - most of the stones being promoted by this author are easily affordable junk minerals that are being sold at the highest possible prices - because this author has trade marked a cute name.Learn to use your internal BS meter a bit better - think for yourself - and don't always trust the *self appointed* experts. Do SEARCHES - this is the internet after all, so inform yourself. Unless you enjoy paying $700 for a necklaces that costs 50 cents.... just because some guy wrote a book and said it was a good idea.I am not saying this because I don't believe in metaphysics - I am saying this because I do believe in metaphysics and because my Metaphysical BS meter works great! :D"
4,My second choice,"This book is full of great information. Each stone is described by two different people. In the end I often get more info than I wanted and sometimes end up confused. This book is never the one I grab first when looking for a symptom or a stone identification. Pictures are good as is the writing, just not my first choice."
5,Excellent!,My husband loves this book and uses it as a companion to The Crystal Bible by Hall. There is a lot of information packed in the book and it is very easy to read. There are quite a few pictures if you need help identifying a stone as well. This is a large book and well worth the money we paid.
5,Great Book!,"Easy to read, good pictures, lots of good imformation. This was a good choice for me as a resource book on healing stones."
3,Variety but difficult to search,"One of the reasons I got this book was to understand the various properties of the stones and crystals I work with both in my spirituality and in my craft, jewelery. I love the completeness of the descriptions however it does not have an index that allows you to figure out what stones and crystals are associated with the different aspects of life and spirit. This makes it more difficult for me to use this book since i frequently have to read everything tto figure out what I want. I do however, use it when siting a book on the properties. I recommend this book but with understanding of its major flaw."
2,"Book of Stones, Revised edition.","If you already have the first edition of this book, you will be disappointed in the lack of new material in this one. Very few new crystals have been added in this edition and all but one of these are trade-marked stones. One entry from the first edition was deleted. There is however, a cross-reference of crystals to spiritual and healing abilities. This is the only good thing in this new edition, but even this is not worth the price of a new book.If you do not own the first edition, then the book is a great reference."
3,Gorgeous with telltale details for each stone.,"I love this book and my granddaughter spends a lot of time browsing through it with me. She is learning the stories and names of the minerals and stones, I am always dreaming of ways to create new jewelry designs. The trademarking of the stones does leave me disconcerted because these are god-given energy and I believe they are not to be gathered and sold for exorbitant prices, nor are they to be trademarked for a company's profit.Essa Adams, authorA Breath Floats Byspirituality fiction, metaphysical, new agealternative healing, reincarnation"
5,LOVE,"Short and Quick, because I Love this book and it happens to be my most prized possession. This is my go to book and I would highly recommend it to anyone whom is interested in spirituality and oneness through crystal healing. LOVE"
4,Nice book but a little overdone!,"This is a good book with lots of great pictures but if you believe everything these two tell you about some of these gems they would have you believing that if you wrap yourself in enough stones you can walk on water. I agree that a lot of ""new"" stones these two have come up with are ""powerful"" in THEIR words. It is a very informative book as long as you do your homework when shopping for stones. If it doesn't come out of the earth, I am not sure you really need it."
3,"Great Book, Shipping took forever","This was a gift and she loved it, she is into crystals and has other books but said this one was the best she'd gotten,however don't be in a hurry to get this book, it took almost three weeks to arrive through ""TOTAL BOOKS"""
2,My Opinion: This is not a field guide or science book,"This no doubt a pretty book; but it is not in my opinion a field guide or technical science book. It is my opinion then that it shouldn't be showing up in searches for field guides...which are the technical science oriented books that one would take along to identify ""things"" like birds, rocks, trees when taking a field trip. This looks to me to be a metaphysical or spiritual book and should be catagorized as such by Amazon. I don't think it's fair to authors of field guides (like me) to have numerous metaphysical books showing up in the ranking of field guides and offsetting the rankings."
1,Little BigFoot 2,I have been waiting for this item to ship since February and still don't have it. The original ship date was March now I am being told it could be May.Chris
3,This is a straightener,I thought this would give me big waves but it just straightened and added shine.
2,"Not recommended for long, thick hair","Although the teflon coating did not damage my hair, the unit did not heat up enough to curl my hair. My hair is very thick and coarse and needs high heat to make it curl. Only when I used the unit with a hot blow dryer would my hair stay curled. I cannot recommend this model for my type of hair."
2,Worked Great... While it WORKED :(,"I bought this curling iron in February 2008. It is now October 2008, and it has just stopped working. I only used it 2-3 days a week, never dropped it, or got it wet. One day, it just stopped heating up :( Before that, it worked GREAT! It's hard to find a 2 inch barrel curling iron... Unfortunately, it has been longer than 30 days, so now I can't return it, and it can't be exchanged because it is no longer available."
1,Would not recommend this product!!,"I ordered this product on March 20, 2007. It worked fine for about 3 weeks and then suddenly stopped working. Now, it does not ever finish heating up. It gets only very slightly warm now (not even close to the point of being too hot to touch) - nothing more. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product."
2,Return policy difficult,Nothing wrong with the jacket. I tried to cancel the order about 3 hours after placing the order and it was impossible to cancel. Had to return the item and pay the shipping. It should be easier to cancel if it's less than 8 hours from the time the item is ordered.
5,WHAT A GREAT STORY... I LOVED IT,"This book really thrilled me. I don't know what book Franklinville NY read, but I thought this one had all the elements of an epic. Hignutt knows her plot twists, she has incredible ideas. The story moves quickly and you have to keep up. Moonsword rules!!!!"
4,Celtic yin yang pewter pendant necklace,I really like the pendant. It goes with a couple scrub tops I wear to work.
2,Cheap Jewelry,"I liked the design on this but the necklace broke after a few weeks and the pendant itself turns a darkish color after a while, maybe it is oxidizing.. I don't know. Its just kinda cheap I guess."
2,So so,"Pendant size is larger than a quater making it a bit gaudy. The leather cord it comes with would probably not fit over the head of most children, so it's useless."
3,2 1990's Romance Novels,A Long Road Home contains two romance novels from separate authors.Stay (1998) is great novel about Jefferson and Emily who grew up together as sibling but fell in love. The story has some great spy storylines and mix of friendship and love. 4 starsHere Comes the Groom (1993) was the story of Allison and Kent who fall in love all over again after a terrible engagement break-up. Allison is resent widow with a sick baby and Kent is stuck in a terrible job and they find there way back to each other. I found this novel very dull. 1 stars
2,A little disappointed,"Some good tips for carving a fish, but I expected more step by step instructuions. The flat one sided piece of wood is not what I expected."
4,Pretty good album,"I think that both this and the regular soundtrack are pretty good. For me, it didn't really catch on a whole lot initially, but I sort of grew into the music. There is in fact going to be an english version of Real Emotion and 1000 Words. It will be on a single by Koda Kumi titled ""Come With Me"". The title track is a new song for her. It includes the 3 songs normally and also has the FFX-2 ones in remix form and has the title song as an instrumental. The date I heard for it is 8/27/03. Also, Kristine Sa has sung an english version of Real Emotion. It was located on her main site, but I'm not sure if it is there anymore."
5,Syntax Handbook review,The book is in very good condition and it arrived very quickly with no problems. I was very happy with my purchase.
3,the end of a era,"This was one of the last real italian crime cop movies of the seventies and it is not up the level of other great crime movies that came before but it's still a good viewing and the best thing about this movie is thatno shame released it. That company would take even minor efforts and give them the first class effort. Of course the company also released some really great movies too. I think the other reviews for this movie tell it like it is about the late great actor merli who was only 49 when he died, but if you like italian crime movies you are going to enjoy this double plotted movie and if you are new to the genre try a different movie first like the cyhic , the rat and the fist."
4,SHADES OF SCARPETTA,"I liked this book in spite of myself. It is a prime example of the ""detective-as-target"" school of mystery writing. Ella Clah not only has to cope with assorted bad guys trying to kill or maim her, she must also deal with being shunned by many of the traditionalist Navajos. Shades of Patricia Cornwell's persecuted heroine, Kate Scarpetta.What redeemed the book in my eyes was that the Thurlos successfully mix Clah's police activities with details of the traditionalist practices of her mother and brother. The only homicide in the story is solved early. The remaining complications arise from factional conflict on the reservation. A couple of Ella's antagonists from previous books get their comeuppance. A pretty slight plot, but an enjoyable read."
4,Good book fun read,"This is a great book for those who like military action. Some of the personal drama seems a little bit over the top, but then I can't really say how genuine it is because I've never served in the military or been in combat. Overall all three books in this trilogy are worth reading."
1,More Techno-Geek Material,"And who is this author? Yesalis? A ""professor of health policy, administration, exercise and sports science at Penn State""? And he has put together what? An ""objective, in-depth collection of articles that examine anabolic-androgenic steroids, their effects, and long-term medical prognosis of use"". Whoopee. Sorry, but men looking for Steroid information aren't looking for this type of ""data"". Men looking for real informaton, information that they can use on Steroids or AAS are going to be wasting their money with this book. If you feel you must read it then hope you find it in a library and not waste your money. If you want information that you can use and from a Bro that you can trust, then check out Anthony Roberts book called Anabolic Steroids: Ultimate Research Guide. And it does mean ULTIMATE. And it is something that you can use and trust being from someone who has Been There and Done That."
3,Very Good!,"[...]Over to my review:This album features some really great neo-prog-metal stuff. The opener ""Magna Carta"" is one of my favorite songs of all time! The music on this album is epic and very adventurous, sometimes even dark. Very complex sometimes, but also pretty easy. This one is pretty difficult to get, though, but if you find it, try it out if you like heavy progressive rock that is both epic and adventurous!Favorite tracks: Magna Carta, Union Jack, Breaking These Circles3.5/5"
2,Not What I Expected,"This is a documentary that relies on news footage. If you watched the news coverage of this, as I did, you just wasted $3."
3,Hoop Dreams,"""Training Rules"" is a fairly interesting documentary about homophobia at Penn State. Women's basketball coach Rene Portland had the trifecta of rules ""no drinking, no drugs, no lesbians"", even if it meant destroying the sporting/academic careers of her students. She cared more whether her students were heterosexual rather than if they could perform on the court. This documentary is narrated by swimmer/NPR commentator Diana Nyad. Most of the documentary consists of talking heads interviews, to its detriment. We never really see daily life at Penn State, the environment that sustained this homophobia. We see the students whom Rene Portland hurt... but she never speaks for herself. What were her motivations? Why was she so homophobic? Was it projection? No explanations are given for her paranoia, or why Penn State enabled it. ""Training Rules"" is sad, moving, yet it lacks a certain depth. ""Training Rules"" aims high, but misses."
3,First Class Only,Gerald Alston is truly frist class. The man is as dynamic in live performances as he is in recorded music
1,Arrived damaged,"This thing doesn't really seem like it is meant to be shipped with a standard carrier. It isn't packed well or at least mine wasn't, just some cardboard pieces around it, no foam. My box was falling apart and the saw had a crack in the base right near one of the feet. Doubt I'll be able to get a replacement now that they are sold out."
5,A cut above the rest....,"Amazon offered the best price for this quality saw. I find the guides and sliding action to be very smooth. I also like the soft start feature when using extension cords. The saw ran great and accurate right out of the box. It runs quiet and the dust collector actually moves particals out of the sawing action. I have used the flourescent light at dusk for finishing a project and it works great, and it was $10 cheaper! I would reccommend this saw for any user. I highly reccommend getting a Rigid miter saw stand with wheels to make it more user friendly on the job site."
3,"Makita LS1214F 12"" Dual Slide Compound Miter Saw with Fluorescent Light","Yes, just like other customer has mentioned. I got the package that look like it has been repackaged. It doesn't look brand new but also it doesn't look like it has been used. However, mine has come with a broken leg so I have to RMA it."
3,"Makita LS1214F 12"" Dual Slide Compound Miter Saw with Fluorescent Light","I am interested in knowing if any others who ordered, got upon receipt of the box, a repackaged unit. Seems to work OK, but definately does not appear to be a new unopened item. Please post, and let me know. Thanks. I did not see where these were refurbs or ""other than new"", in the original itme listing."
4,Nice CD Player,"This has been a fun bargain. It enables us to hear our favorite CDs by using the ""Car Kit"" plugged into the car's cassette player, which is connected to the CD player."
3,A Great Read.,"A strong effort by small literary groups, this has been a success. Many of the stories are very strong, on both the Hobart and MoBike side. THough there are small errors in the text, and the print size of the Mobike side may be a little too large, the quality of the writing on both sides is near flawless. Hopefully, people will support these two because they can make great things happen."
1,it barely scratched the surface!!!,I was very disappointed by the book. I thought it would contain more than an emergency kit checklist and multiple references to other things to do with dogs. It was definitely not worth the money. It was also frustrating to see multiple typos as I read the book. My advice...keep looking for another book. I am returning this one as soon as the mailman comes back.
5,Even better than the first edition!,I love this book! A simple guide to hiking with your dog. Written in layman's terms yet highly educational. Easy to carry and easy to access information to keep your dog safe when backpacking or camping.
3,Reader for the Audio Book was Annoying,"I listened to an unabridged version of this novel and almost couldn't finish it because the reader was so annoying. The author had her characters smiling or laughing all the time, and the reader interpreted this to mean she should read entire passages as if they were laughing the words. Had Allen edited for word repetition more carefully and watched for redundancy in thought, she would have had a better book overall, and I don't think the reader would have over-used her laugh. I liked the way the plot all came together in the end, but if I had been reading a hardcopy rather than listening to a tape, I know I would have had to read with a red editing pen in hand."
5,So well made!!!,"First of all I feel lucky to have found this as ""dent and scratch"" type of item. It is an ATA flight case...who cares if the packing box was damaged? As far as the PedalTrain board itself...super light weight. Came with Pedal Power 2 mounting bracket and instructions. A drill, a screw driver and 15 minutes is all you need and you are ready to go. Already played a gig with it. Finally all my pedals (14) on one board. As far as the case...built like a tank.I just feel like all the bases are covered for the rest of my days as it relates to my pedals.If you use a lot of pedals, this is the pedal board for you whether you get the hard case or soft.My suggestion is to measure your pedals and cut them to scale out of graph paper. Then take a sheet that is 32 x 16 boxes in size. You can arrange your board right on the table in front of you to scale.I hope you too find a ""dent and scratch"" deal."
1,This book stings the sensiblilities of Orthodox Jews,"Carol Matas is careful to note in the introduction to her book that the story bears no relationship to any real person, living or dead. She then goes on to skillfully weave a realistic tale of a young girl, who must brave the pressure of peers and a respected Rabbi, in order to extricate herself from an abusive situation. The falsehood in this book is its strength; It portrays an orthodox Rabbi as an abuser of young girls. Matas is careful to say that she modeled this character on her imagination. My objection to this book is that I doubt that she or anyone else can produce an example of an American Orthodox Rabbi doing what she says her fictional character is capable of.This book does not portray our world faithfully. It is a flawed product, and not in good taste."
1,Not good at all,"I found all 3 DVDs in this series very boring. I was expecting to see crashes from racing series people have actually heard of, like NASCAR or F1 or NHRA, or maybe even things like sprint cars. However, the crashes seen in these videos seem to be from very small and unimportant leagues that nobody has ever heard of, and also these crashes are nothing new and you can see most of them on the freeway. It also seems that most of the footage was shot in either the 70's or 80's, which isn't very entertaining. Save your money,"
4,Winky's Horse DVD,"Our granddaughters, 8 and 10, loved this movie. Would recommend it for a child horse-lover."
5,Great Bread,"The recipes in this book are described so well that even a novice baker will turn out world class loaves of bread. All through my college years I worked in a Pizza restaurant. I made pizza dough by following the directions on the 25lb bag of pizza flour. That had been my only baking experinece, but after deciding to attempt baking bread at home, I bought this book. My first loaf turned out better than anything I could buy at a supermarket."
5,The M Club Manual,"As a member if The M Club from the upper limits of the age spectrum, I find the Manual a source of both amusement and amazement. Many of the situations are common to all of us, but the off-beat solutions are surely those of a 21st Century empowered woman. It is great that being a member of the ""club"" includes me in this charmed circle.The writing is cleverly forceful, and the format--short, quickly moving situations--makes it a book you can open with only a few minutes to spare, minutes that leave you chuckling, renewed for life's everyday battles and armed with a refreshing moral certainty.The M Club Manual is a book that every member should keep handy for its combined message of laughter and courage in the face of life's demands. Just a few minutes of reading will rekindle your enthusiasm for the daily fight against the vexing vicissitudes of the world around us.by eminent critic Mary L. StewartFirst woman sports writer for the Cleveland News (1948)"
1,Not best buy for price,"Pack was used regularly for 4 months before it ripped. Not even used for heavy items, just to carry 2 books and a few pens. Not the best way to spend your money."
4,Nice book,"While it may appeal to a rather small group of readers,this book is nonetheless a treasure trove of photographsand information about many of the depots - big and small -in northwest Ohio. My father grew up in this area many yearsago so I purchased the book for him... and he loved it!"
5,Really Good!!,"This is a great figure, you can have tons of fun with it, its pretty educational...if ur studying the military. The duribility is fine but im not a fan of the bendy hands so i buy so cool gloved ELITE FORCE hands and put them on instead!Overall its great, I love the whole look of the figure because it somewhat looks like the soldiers in GHOST RECON AVANCED WARFIGHTER and i LOVE that game for the X-BOX 360, also the guns look like they come from GHOST RECON AVANCED WARFIGHTER. I dont really like the 50 cal. (because i have 3 now) but anyways the XM8 is friggin awsome , i love that gun as a toy , airsoft , and in ghost recon! Also the M4 kinda looks like the Scar Carbine in GHOST RECON AVANCED WARFIGHTER....So i think its an awsome action figure 2 buy.(Also,Its At A Cheap Price)"
1,broken in box,"I purchased the larger version of this Intex Easy Set Pool (18'x 48""), and was EXTREMELY disappointed with the product. The ladder steps were wrong for the ladder bar (we had to file them down to make them fit), when we opened the filter pump box all the plastic hoses were cracked and split, and to cap it all off there was a hole in the bottom of the pool. I would NOT suggest buying an INTEX pool. It's not worth the hassle."
4,Game that's hard to rate,"First of all, I have to say I've never played a game like this before. I enjoy puzzle games like Sodoku, so this was my first attempt at a game like this. Overall I like the progression of the game. There are parts that completely challenge you and the puzzles have similar feels without feeling the same. The more I got used to playing the better I got at solving the puzzles. I liked it."
4,good choice for creative play,I bought this for my 9 yr old son who loves computer games. He complained at first that he couldn't figure it out. But soon after he was happy and creating many things. Happy with purchase.
4,Intriguing & challenging,"If your child is good at science this game will certainly challenge him/her. It will also challenge parents if they are equally involved in stuff like this. As a whole it could be parent(s) spending time together with their kids & challenging themselves at the same time. It also provides solution to compare it to what solution you might find. Have given it to one of niece, she found quite challenging, considering she is smart gal. Can also create your experiment as mentioned in the description etc. Fyi, did not have any installation issues. Graphics are good. I would recommend buying it if your child is really interested in this kind of game."
5,Crazy Machines: The Wacky Contraptions Game,I bought this game for my grandson's 9th birthday. He thinks it is the greatest--so does his Dad.
1,"Difficult for younger kids, software is lacking","We bought this for our 8 yr old son due mostly to all the great reviews this had rec'd at the time. I've found the best games for kids are those that kids can easily figure out how to play it, and this is not that kind of game. If your kid is younger than a teen, an adult will likely need to be with him/her to help the kid figure everything out.And even adults will need to spend time trying to figure out how to operate the game or how to do the various puzzles.Directions are lacking and the game says a manual is available on the CD. I could not find one anywhere on the CD. I emailed the games support dept. weeks ago, and still haven't gotten a reply.This game's graphics and directions are severely lacking compared to other kids' software. And the support is non-existent.Our bright 8 year old quickly lost interest in the game because of the poor directions.I regret having bought this game."
3,"""Crazy Machines"" ok, but ""Clue Finders"" was a bigger hit and more educational","My boys are 7 and 10. They received multiple computer games for Christmas. They thought Crazy Machines was fun, but spent much more time with ""Amazon Trail"" and ""Clue Finders"" educational games."
1,CAN'T GET CRAZY MACHINES TO WORK!,We too were excited to get this well reviewed educational game and are very frustrated at not being able to use it. No assistance from creators as emails go unanswered and phone message box is full. anyone with any suggestions? thanks!!
2,Problems running on Intel Mac or G4 Tower,"I had hoped to purchase this well reviewed game so that my son could enjoy playing with all the various puzzles, gears etc (ever since Lego took down their online game of a similar nature) -- well disappointment. Does not run properly on my Intel iMac - and then it also does not run on my older G4 Mac Tower. Emails to the vendor's website go unanswered, but I hold out hope, that maybe I will purchase a used Dual G5 tower down the road, and then I might enjoy this bargain of a software package."
1,It requires Rosetta (PPC Emulation) be installed,"I was hopeful of a MAC universal binary but it requires rosetta to be installed to run. Sure it will run on an older mac G4 or an intel mac with OSX 10.6 or earlier, but it didn't spell out this requirement in the description. That being said this will not run in OSX 10.7 (Lion since rosetta is no longer supported. So while it is MAC compatible the packaging lies when it says ""OSX 10.3 or higher"" since it no longer works in 10.7."
5,Amazing! Great educational game.,"This is a classic game. Definitely a classic. There are so many video games out there that you get almost nothing except for entertainment; some of them even inappropriate for little kids. This game, you get not only thinking skills but fun and entertainment as well. The puzzles teach them logic and problem solving. Both my 6-yr-old and 11-yr-old enjoy this game. There are hundreds of levels. You will find levels that are challenging for adults as well. Graphics is superb, audio is soothing and appropriate.It comes in a small box with a single CD and no documentation at all, but you will find everything of the how tos in the game itself.My system is a 3-year old slim Dell Inspiron 530 with Windows XP. No problem in installation.It is even recommended in my kids' school in Fairfax County as one of the favorite toys in their list."
4,Tougher then it looks!,I thought this was more a kids game but my wife loved TIM (The Incredable Machine) and we have been looking for a replacement that will work in XP. This is not an easy game to play as you really have to use your brain to solve the puzzles. I find the controls a little hard to get the hang of but after you do then the game is a real challenge. Highly Recommended!
4,Too picky in some cases,"This game provides many good problem-solving exercises. My 14 and 16-year-old grandsons spent many hours with it, and (unintentionally) learned some basic physics in doing so.There are some problems, however. Some of the solutions depend upon such exact placement of the items on the screen that your time is spent placing and re-placing the items instead of deciding on basic strategies to solve the problem. In at least one case a solution would not work, but when an item was taken out and then put back in what seemed to be exactly the same place, the solution worked.None-the-less, this game is better than many of the mindless alternatives that clutter today's computers in the name of education."
5,Great Game for both Kids and Adults,"I purchased this game for my husband for Father's Day, but it is so fun, the whole family works on it together! It is a game of puzzles which you have to figure out what you need where to make the desired outcome. It is a good problem-solving game for the kids (mine are 6 and 7 years old)and parents alike. They can also create their own experiments, which my 7 year-old particularly likes. I highly recommend!"
5,Not good,This game was meant for young children and neither my 5 yr old son or I can figure out how to use it. There are no instructions for how to use it either.
3,Fun but?,"Is anyone else a little worried about this game for kids? It is fun AND I get a real kick out of it but in this terrorist age, isn't a game that teaches how to use real explosives to very young children just a little troubling?"
1,No support for Mac,"This looks like a fun game with a really reasonable price. Problem is, on my iMac running 10.6.8, the game does not start! Even worse, my requests for help, on their website as suggested, and by email, go ignored. I printed the manual as suggested... no help. I went to their forums as suggested... they were in a language I don't understand. On one help page, someone complains about this issue, and is told to use a wired mouse... no help there, as I'm using a wired mouse. It seems that the hardest puzzle one must solve is how to start the program. The price may have looked reasonable, but I feel ripped off."
5,FUTURE ENGINEERS WILL LOVE IT!,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. It takes lots of creativitiy and imagination. He spends more time on this than video games. I think this is a great gift for the future engineer or scientist!
4,"Not as good as the old ""Incredible Machines""","The graphic is crapy and slow.The game filfills the purpose, but fails to impress with smooth operation and fine granular graphic.Overal - 4 out of 5."
4,Should carry a warning: Highly addictive,"Purchased this for my 12yo son. He got his 9 yo brother hooked. I decided to take a look and see what it was all about and spent the next day at work yawning 'cause I stayed up WAY TOO late just doing one more puzzle... and then just one more.... My husband is the only one who hasn't gotten hooked on it yet - due to our warnings and lack of access to the computer to play!Some of the puzzles get a little frustrating but there is a ""cheat file"" with screenshots of solutions to resort to. It is often a matter of just a very fine difference between solution and failure, and hard to see, but so far we haven't come across one we couldn't figure out. The boys love being able to set up a screen full of explosions and just letting it go in their own ""free form"" designs."
2,XP and support problems,"Purchased for Christmas. Installs w/out complaint but only runs when my son has administrator privleges on Windows XP Pro. I prefer him to have a limited account. No help on Viva Media's support page. Did all they asked and emailed for help. Response seemed automated -- clearly had not read my email. I followed up w/ second email on 12/28. It is now 1/4, no further response from them.He likes the game -- it's fine. Their support is poor and the idea that you have to have admin provleges to run a game like this is absurd."
1,Difficult to launch,"I have been trying to install the game on a Windows XP machine with 1.4GHz processor and 512 MB of SDRAM. I turn all other programs off while installing. The installation procedure is simple and takes less than 5 minutes. However, once the installation is complete, I am unable to launch the program. Everytime I try to launch it an ""Application Maintenance"" menu pops up even though the install program clearly states the installation is successful. I have been able to launch the game twice - not sure how. My daughter has become extremely frustrated by the whole experience."
5,If I could give 10 I would do it,"This game is SUCH a rare exception to the other meaningless PC games on the market that it should be separated into its own category. FINALLY there is something on the market that forces our kids and us to THINK, LEARN, and EXPLORE. I loved it, and for me the word ""love"" is a very strong word never used before for PC game. My 11 years old son was suspicious at the beginning but he played for 2 hours straight and needed to be pulled out of computer. My sincere thanks to the creators of the game and to all other folks who participated in creation of this beauty."
4,Crazy Machines--Pensive Minds,"My 5 yr-old daughter and I consistently play Crazy Machines together. I am the operator, she the brains. It is a wonderful puzzle built in an enigma. We rate it high on the game scale. Its learning curve is consistent with its goals. Its open-ended part and the ability to save is fantastic for my daughter who sometimes fails to see moon gravity vs. earth gravity.Yes, it is great. The music is sooo nice and pleasing; the Professor, however, is annoying but can be turned off. We can't wait for the next one to come out. It isn't a handicap, though, because we keep going back to different levels and trying them again."
4,Fun game -- for Kids & Parents Together,"My son and I have had fun playing this game together. He is 10 (I'm a bit older). Some of the puzzle/scenarios are pretty easy, while others are more challenging. The more complicated ones may offer more than one possible solution --we've had a couple of solutions that are different than the designer's ""plan"". I agree with previous reviews that kids can learn a little about physics, too. We discuss possible solutions together and try them out, and so the process is the real value in the game."
5,Addictive,I bought this for my mother who quickly became addicted. Some patience is required as some of the machine solutions are quite exacting. She also enjoyed creating her own puzzles. Well worth the money.
3,Murky Instructions,I purchased both Crazy Machines & Logic Machines. The most annoying thing about these games are getting started. The instructions on how to play these games are not detailed I found that i had to figure out how to play these games by trail error and frustration. In Crazy Machies for instance there is a utility shelf that is hidden at the top of the screen The professor mentions this shelf briefly in the beginning of the tutorial but he does not make it clear to the player that this tool shelf will not be in plain sight (let alone how the player is suppose to get them off the shelf) In Logic machines the professor goes in even less details. leaving the player to viturally figure out the game all on his own.
3,Engineering vs frustration.,"If you like puzzles you will like this game. I don't always get the ""planned"" machine configuration built but somehow I get the finished result. At the completion of the task you can view the planned result and also replay your plan. The review helps with building the next machine. I have not found a way for the game to give you a clue as to how a machine should be built so sometimes it is a lot of trial and error with a dose of frustration. All in all it is a challenge to your engineering ability and frustration level. For the price you can't go wrong. Hours of fun awaits."
1,"Crashes consistently on Intel mac, installed Rosetta","Running and Intel iMac with 10.6.6. At first program crashed consistently after 5 minutes. Installed Rosetta, and so far so good as this is a Power PC app.Still have to rate as 1 star, as system requirements not clear on this. Also at this time, mid-March 2011, the next mac os 10.7 may remove support for Rosetta. At that time Intel based macs running 10.7 may not be able to run this program.Since I plan to upgrade all my Intel macs once 10.7 is released, this program then may cease to work. If I'd known that at purchase wouldn't have bought.Otherwise my 7 year old is having a good time so far. He'll be sad if this stops to work after os upgrade."
1,"Will Not Load Onto PC, Manufacturer No Help","I had great expectation from this software for my boy, but apparently the product came defective. I tried to load it onto my two PCs, but it would not load onto either of them due to errors. I emailed the manufacturer about the problem, but received no response after two weeks. So, I had to send it back to Amazon."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is total garbage. It won't even run on a brand new laptop with XP home. It will instal and load just fine but when you try to run it nothing hapens at all. The manufacturer is no help. I tried several times to contact them with no responce. I also tried ot install and run it on a computer with windows 2K with no luck. now I'm stuck with a worthless game. I would have rated it at zero stars if that was an option.
1,Won't run.,"I could understand it if I got an error or something, but I don't. I'm a computer professional, so this isn't a ""is it plugged in"" type error. I click the icon and....nothing. I run it from the Terminal....nothing. No output (except a useless log file), no messages, no errors. Just....nothing.Even if the problem is my hardware, only the poorest quality of software leaves the user this much in the dark."
1,A great disappointment,"I put this on my wish list, remembering the old ""incredible machine"" games and the like. This is a sad, pale imitation of them. The graphics are pretty, the physics simulation is good, but the puzzles are dreadful.Many of them are so simple that anyone over the age of four can do them with little effort. Some others are just mind-bogglingly stupid that when you are done you'll be offended that anyone thought that was a puzzle.The user interface is atrocious. Much of what you'll do is look (without manuals) how to place items, set them up, and every time you click the wrong thing the scorekeeper will penalize you for clicking wrong.Avoid."
2,Buggy,"Continually pauses on a high-end computer with WinXp. If it didn't do this the game would be wonderful for children. Having read this in other folks disappointment with customer support and that there is no patch to be found on the Web, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Don't hesitate to buy this!,"Wow! What a find! This is an amazing book! You can hardly stop looking at the beautiful photos long enough to try the recipies! But when you do.........you'll be very happy! Be sure to try the Chicken Vinagrette on page 127, as it is the tastiest thing I have ever put into my mouth!"
1,Not good,"I do not know what happened with the quality inspection of these Bluetooth. I have purchased quite a few of the same ones.(great in ear ) This one and the previously purchased one had to be sent back. Neither would charge! I am saddened to say that I am disappointed in them.For now!Sincerely,Tony V."
2,100% pure snake oil,I guess it moisturizers my face. it smells like skunk and it's not worth the stench because it did nothing for my scars. just made them greasy if anything. I read a lot about how great tamanu oil is for acne scars but this just stunk up my skin and I used it for 3 wks. save your money I got better results from rubbing a lemon on my face.
3,Stealthisreview,"It seems to me that the studios found themselves with an enormous talent on their hands named Frank Sinatra, but did not know what to do with him. So they stuck him in these silly films that would appeal to his bobby soxer fans (who'll see anything he's in good or bad) to make a fast buck. The studio was really doing him and his audience a disservice by not making better use of his talents with excellent scripts and songs. Wasted talent. Anyway, Frank sings nicely and looks adorable in his period costumes, but why must they keep casting him as the innocent lunkhead--very repititious casting. There is no reason a romantic comedy couldn't be better written. This is still a fun film to watch for Frank fans (and I guess Grayson fans and other minor character actors)."
2,"Poor, poor Sinatra-you should have sued MGM","What a shame that MGM mistreated a talent like Sinatra. This is another example of terrible miscasting, terrible plot, and even terrible costumes for him. I love musicals, so this is not a criticism of the genre. I just expect something more than this turkey. This seems like a poor (very poor) cousin to Yolanda and the Thief. At least that movie had a great director (Minnelli), wonderful and creative costumes and settings, and terrific photography. Even with all that, and Fred Astaire, the movie did poorly at the box office. I wonder why MGM tried to recycle a failure?"
3,Fun movie filled with songs and dances.........3.5 stars,"You cant really compare a movie with Frank Sinatra and Kathryn to a movie with Mario Lanza with Kathryn Grayson as they are both very much different. But as this title brought back memories of movies that ive seen as a kid...i was very pleased that i found it and it happens to be kind of funny, filled with adventure, songs and dances. Nice to see old Franky, refreshenly young and not being too serious. Kathryn and Frank songs are pleasant enough and so is this movie from beginning to end. And ive notice that kathryn grayson has some great close-ups of her face when she is falling in love with Frank.... Lots of color.... a Keeper."
4,"There is ""nothing wrong"" with this movie","This is deffinatly one of the more romantic Grayson-Sinatra movies. The songs are great and J. Carrol Naish is very funny!! There is a wonderful ""Dance of Fury"" in which Ann Miller, Ricardo Montalban, and Cyd Charrise do some Spanish dancing. You know how in all the old movies the man always serenades the woman, well that does happen in this movie, but in return, Kathryn Grayson serenades Frank Sinatra! So as you can see, this movie does have it's comedy, but it's really a romantic love story about two totally different kinds of people. This is a must see!"
1,Game Over,"Although others' reviews warned me this was a formulaic film, I was surprised at just how bad it was. It is arguably Gene Kelly's worst performance--totally hammy and annoying. Even his dancing energy seems off, and he's clearly bored. Frank is limited in his role as the innocent. The musical numbers are pretty awful. I was bored and disappointed."
5,heavenly grill,"The grill was just what we needed. Our roadtrip came with a griddle, but we grill more often. Now we have twice the grilling surface. The cast iron also added a better non-stick surface"
3,"Direct replacement, not a fan that using a pot on it voids the warranty","The product is good, but I use the grill for cooking on camp outs. It's a direct replacement for the Coleman Road Trip grill. The only issue is that you void the warranty by putting a pot or pan on it. I'm not sure how they would know, but the fact that each grill comes with a warning is a little silly. But it's a good product and I haven't had any issues using a pot or pan on it, doesn't seem to adversely affect it. Not anymore than a grill brush rubbing it would."
5,Coleman Road Trip cast iron grill,My grill came with a flat cast iron pan on one side. I wanted it to be a grill on both sides. Perfect!
4,Grilling out by the lake,Well this grate worked out just fine. Cooked up a batch of hamburgers at the last camp out. Seems ribeyes were the hit on the 2nd night. Get one ....
2,Ehhhhh,It wasn't as good as the one that comes with the grill. This one the food really sticks to the grill when you try to cook on it.
2,Coleman Iron Grill is not a favorite purchase,I do not like this grill. It is very heavy and difficult to clean. It is not the same easy to clean grill that comes with the Road Trip grill.
1,Coleman RoadTrip Grill,I returned the one they sent because it was not the right finish. I had ordered the non-stick. I called and was told no problem send it back with a note and they would send the correct one out. It has not arrived yet.Customer service worked with me I had no problem with them. To date I have been satisfied with the service but can't give a 5 star yet.
5,The Coleman BBQ Grills,I ordered the grills for my coleman stove so we don't have to carry the BBQ. The conversion works great and is faster than my BBQ. Makes more sence to carry one unit that will do several cooking tasks. Great Idea Mel
2,Awesome Band -- buy something else.,"Man, I would be TICKED if I bought this for ten dollars. The first two songs are from Highly Refined Pirates. The third song is a minute long ""trippy"" instrumental. The fourth song, being the only legitimate non-album song, is okay, but not worth ten dollars.THAT SAID, I MUCH prefer the demo version of I Lost All My Money At the Cock Fights to the album version on Highly Refined Pirates. Reason enough to buy this CD? Of course not.Do yourself a favor -- go download the last two tracks (legally) for two bucks and take the other eight and put it towards one of Minus the Bear's other releases. They're an amazing band."
3,It's A Promo,"Yes, there are songs on here identical to their debut, so you probably don't need to get it. The other tracks (also on the bonus track version of Highly Refined Pirates) aren't really essential. One's just another transition track like those short ones on their debut album. The demo of ""I Lost All My Money At The Cock Fights"" is kind of cool, though. But realize that this was a PROMO for the band. I guess they just wanted to get money by making it an EP. Maybe just something special to sell while on tour? Anyway, absolutely not necessary unless you're a completest."
4,Beautiful dishes,"The dishes are beautiful. They were bought as a gift so I haven't used them, but I was very pleased with them upon arrival and know they will be appreciated."
1,HOW MUCH?!?!,"I really love this tea. But, $38.00??? They can keep it.I'll buy directly from Bigelow for less than $20 for the box of 6."
1,put together,"We put the robot together ok it ran good for about 10 min, then the shaft that holds the drive wheels had to much play and stripped the 1/2 moon area out, this is cheap and cannot be altered once its worn the part needs to be replaced. Being a new toy. I'm sure some kits are not going to do this while others will because of the walking action."
2,3 out of 4 work,"This kit adds two 'leg' kits to the better value 'Jungle Robot' (a pretty great robot, also, shamefully, discontinued by OWI)For the rediculous price difference, one should get something more than the two additional leg kits, one of which doesn't work.The drivers that fit on the end of the output shaft are a weak spot. If any part of the legs jam it will likely break the driver's plastic socket as another noted. Be sure to remove any burrs on the drivers and the other associated circular links. They are timed to ensure that the burrs will contact each other, leading to a broken driver."
2,Certainly an Illusion,"After having read Ms. Starr's previous works ""Fate"" and ""Chances"" I can't believe the same author wrote Illusions. Well I just finished this novel and I am sorry to say I was disappointed and although there is some valuable information regarding diabetes there is little else that made me love and care about the characters as I did with the characters from ""Fate"" and ""Chances"".Zain and Asa's relationship from start to finish was one huge misunderstanding, him thinking she's an alcoholic and her thinking he's an uncompassionate jerk. This novel was definitely an ""Illusion"". Although I can't wait to see what Ms. Starr comes up with next, Illusions is definitely not on my read again list. Better luck next time."
2,Wrong Genre,"First let me tell you that Illusions is not an interracial romance, Zain and Asa, the couple in the book are African-American. I don't understand how this mix up occurred, because when they referred to Zain looks he is African-American, so whoever thought this book was interracial they were wrong. The book was okay, it did not live up to Pamela Leigh Starr's other books. I loved Fate and the books that were sequel to that but Illusions was a disappointment. Zain didn't discover Asa was a diabetic until almost the end of the book, that was to long for him to discover her true disease. So for future readers who think this book is interracial and that's what you are looking for it's not in this book."
4,"Big end of the world storyline, lots of fun","The JLA face a doomsday weapon known as the Anti-Sun, the Primordial Annihilator, and Mageddon in this story from Grant Morrison. Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang (consisting of Luthor, Zazzala, Prometheus, and General Eiling) destroy the JLA's moon-based Watchtower before Mageddon takes over Luther's mind. The JLA find assistance from Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Big Barda, and Orion who brings his dog Sturmer along for the ride. It's very over-the-top and fun."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Justice League face a large scale menace from space, and with that on their plate already, the Injustice Gang and that bald guy that likes to harrass Superman decide the time is right to make a play for dominance.The League will not be able to overcome such threats without sacrifice."
1,???? {sigh},"First, let me state that I do not keep up with the writers of these books. I like the JLA, so I read the comics. Its as simple as that. That being said, this is the worst I've read. {I've read them all} WWIII made no sense to me what-so-ever. Alot of the JLA books do that, but they usually come together in the end. This book nearly stopped me from reading JLA books. But I took a chance with a later one and everything seemed ok. I guess they changed writers. {Thank God} I don't write bad reviews to bash anything. But I feel potential buyers should be warned."
1,Disappointing,"I don't know how anyone who read the fabulous ""DC One Million"", ""Rock of Ages"" or ""Justice For All"" or even ""Strength in Numbers"" could compare them to World War III. There is simply too much going on here and not enough artwork or time is given to develop the themes. For example, GL's attempt to battle Maggedon for the ring is epic and quite possibly the lynchpin of the plot - it gets a whole 10 panels. I felt that this was rushed and somehow less fleshed out than its predecessors. I know this is just a comic book; the standards set by the authors in their previous work led me to expect more."
2,Dissapointing,"This story would have been good enough if ...had been written forty years ago.had NOT been by Grant Morrison.Morrison's return to JLA was really dissapointing. For all of us who followed his run in Animal Man and other Vertigo classics, this one is plain too simple.If you like classic stories from the Fifties or Sixties, where good from evil can be clearly told apart, this story might be for you. If you expect something more edgy, maybe you should look somewhere else."
5,WOW,"I was amazed at how good they were. The cost was more than I wanted to pay, but they are worth it. I play bass and they don't allow us to use monitors at all. They have some small box that goes through a direct box and we plug our headsets into that. Whenever I used it before, my bass sounded like garbage. NOW, WOW-it sounds like a real bass and everything else sounds great too. High price but it is worth it."
5,Great sounding pro earbuds...but...,"The E500s are the greatest sounding earbuds.... but a word of caution. Be very careful while removing and fitting the many ear canal tips included as the STEM has a lot of leverage forces applied to it in the process. Mine broke off after a month but on return to SHURE they were PROMPTLY REPLACED by brand new ones with no questions or proof of purchased asked. The date of manufacture is on the mini-plug itself. Coded as for example 3146. Meaning March (the 3) 14th. and year '06.GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE FROM SHURE. The Push-To-Talk gizmo is not very useful as its actually a slide-to-talk switch and is rather bulky. They should be available by now with a cheaper option of ordering them WITHOUT the PTT thing. ENJOY."
5,Great 99% of the time,"Having used these for a few days now, they really are quite wonderful. The PTH module is really nice when you have the triple flange buds deep in your ears and don't want to take them out for just a moment of conversation.Compared to the Shure e3c's I've used for a few years, they sound better and are considerably more comfortable. I would like to note that they are not any better than the Shure e3c's when listening to music at low volume. I like to listen to music at a whisper when studying, but you really need to turn it up a bit for these things to shine."
1,"Great Sound , Bad Wires","I purchased these from Amazon, and used them every day since. Great sound, but the wires won't stand long. I got mine taped cause the wires inside began to show after the outer rubber began to crack. And you can't change the wires because they're not replaceable. The only thing you can do is to fix them the hard way or ship them back to shure so be replaced."
4,Too pricy for small earphones,"You can get the same sound quality or better sound out of large headphones. But if you are willing to pay the price for samll, the E5000PTH are the ones to get. They have a totaly flat frequency sound. Not too much highs and not too much lows to kill the mids.Albert"
4,Pretty Good!,It was a little boring at first and then it started to pick up. I enjoyed and I would recommed it!
3,Bastion Falls,"It is a decent novel for a first book. I found the story a bit slow in places, but overall I enjoyed it."
2,Not for me,"The first time I tried it, I thought maybe I did not give it enough time to soak into the meat. I then used it again rubbing it to the meat. I then put the meat in a container and placed back into the refrigerator. After two hours, I took the meat out and prepared side dishes. I let the meat sit for about 20 minutes and then cooked it. For too much cumin for me and the hint of coco was to strong. I will stick with other rubs I use."
1,"Junk - If you want to, you could just throw your money out the window","This broke after about 20 sheets of paper. The intake doesn't work now and I have to hand-feed each sheet very carefully. Even then it only ""takes"" about half the time. It doesn't work for incoming because of this either. Total waste of money."
1,Disappointed,"Since I was planning on my first trip to Michigan, more in the Upper Peninsula area, I must say I was disappointed in this book. If I'd known it was all about camping at state parks, I would not have purchased this book. Plus, there was very little on the National Parks. I also thought it was difficult to navigate."
4,"Complete, Maybe for State Parks","Overall, this is a pretty good book. It claims to be a ""Complete Guide"" - but there is very little coverage of National Parks in Michigan. None that I could think of, and that I wanted to research, were listed.The coverage of the State parks is good, however, if you're looking for National Park coverage, you'll need to look elsewhere."
5,At Last,"Finally an Asian American work that avoids cliches and writes about such things as Asian American men and Asian Hottie fetish mixed with racism and sexual politics to boot--and all with real intelligence. Lee pins everyone to the wall--men and women--explores their issues, their sexuality, their prejudices, and their hang-ups in a subtle, but engaging and realistic way. The prose is top-rate, Lee is a masterful storyteller on par with some of the best fiction writers out there. The stories ""Casual Water"" and the eponymous ""Yellow"" are poignant, well-written stnadouts; but check out ""Domo Arigato,"" the story of a Korean American male and his white lover in Japan, and you get the feeling of Finally! Really great writing that has finally broken past the cliched Asian American streotypes of the past!"
4,"Great size, but the body is a little slippery.","This pen seems well-made and sturdy. The size in wonderful! The ink flow seems typical for a ball-point, and not nearly as nice as a gel pen. My only real complaint is the the body is very smooth, and my finger slip on the body while trying to use it. They need to add some texture or grooves to the body near where you hold on to it. Other than this one minor complaint, this is the perfect size for what I wanted to do with it.I also have no idea if this is refillable or not. I purchased this at a ""coffee and paper"" shop, and there were no instructions. The web site of the manufacturer does not mention it as being refillable. I am afraid to try to pull it apart for fear of breaking it. However, it will not get much use, so the ink running out should not be a problem for me.**UPDATE**It can take standard ""short"" refills. I believe that Zebra makes a 2-pack that will fit just fine."
5,I loved this book!,"This is a very nice book -- Except, WAIT -- I think it is about MY LIFE! Ha.I guess I could really relate to the dismal, suburban setting and the odd suburban characters. I loved the Goth son and his rich friend. The husband was, well, in many ways, pretty typical! Janie manages to rally, but you can see why it wasn't easy for her.If you are wondering how you ended up in suburbia you'll be able to relate to Janie too."
1,"Bad picture quality, bad form, bad DVD","This DVD has so many flaws I dont know where to begin.1. Master Mak filmed ALL the Poomse's on a playing field in grass high enough to cover his ankles (so you cant see what his feet are doing) and you even see cars driving by in the background sometimes.2. There are artificial sound effects for EACH kick and punch (they soundlike they came from an arcade game).3. The camera is not steady as the person filming it sometimes jerks it up and down.4. Master Mak sometimes slighly ""stumbles"" while performing techniques (maybe its because he's doing the Poomse in the grass, who knows).5. I could go on and on, but why bother?Dont waste your money on this DVD."
3,kinda iffy,"I recieved this product and it didn't charge my controllers, i later found that it was the wire that came with the product, that didn't work, over all good product changed the wire too the wire that came with my controller now it works fine. might wanna look into that though. thank you."
4,"Good, but don't use included cable!","Okay, so I got this today, and tried to plug it in to the PS3. No luck (as others stated). Then I tried it on my computer. Also, no luck. Then I got an idea... what if the cable simply is not giving the voltage needed (requires USB 2.0 speed).... and I decided to try with a known working cable (the one that came with the PS3). With the cable that comes with the PS3 attached to the charging dock it charges no problem.The cable is the problem! It does say no cable included, and essentially... that's true. Just use the charge cable that comes with the PS3 or buy a USB to Micro USB cable - problem solved."
1,doesn't work it all,"doesn't charge period..... the charging lights blinks for couple minutes and that set then it doesn't charge anymore..... I tried different positions but nothing work..... completely waste of money..... I should read the reviews first......like my father says ""lo barato sale caro"""
2,not recommended,"Well, i only made it works when put both controls at the same times but anyways this products is full of designs mistakes.First the blue ligths becomes something annoying, second it works only with the PS3 on, not even in standby mode, three you can't charge only one control when you want it."
3,charges great,It charges the controllers really fast but it has to be plugged into the PS3. I would prefer it to plug into the wall socket so I could have it on my remote table and not on top of the game box
1,what happened,i used this for 2 days and by the third day the little connecter to the controller snapped off and i just carefully put the controller on. what a waste of my money.
1,P.O.S.,"Enough said. Buy a different charger for your controllers. On the up side, it was so inexpensive, it isn't even worth paying to send it back."
4,it's good for what it is..,"I have had this for a few months now, I am pleased that it does still charge my PS3 controllers, but I am not pleased that it no longer lights up anymore, if it still lit up then I would have giving this 5 stars, but since it doesn't I am just going to give it a 4."
4,It works!!,"Like everyone I thought this product was to good to be true. But I purchased anyway because it was so cheap. I works well it charges the controllers easy. I had one of my controllers that would not charge or come on for some reason, I guess the battery was really dead. I tried charging it while I was playing my PS3 the regular way and it still would not work. So I purchased a new controller on amazon and also picked up this charger. I put the controller that was not working on it and what do you know it charged back up and works! LOL So now I have a extra. Good product!"
4,Works and looks cool,"As the title says, it charges the controllers and looks cool because its got a blue light. Other than that it feels a little cheap so its not perfect."
2,cheap for cheap,"You get what you pay for in this instance. Very cheap feeling, only charges controlers when the PS3 unit is powered on but for the price I really can't complain yet. I will update as I learn more about this product."
4,good,so far so good was a little hesitant after the reviews i saw but theyre cheap money a couple bucks is nothing
3,Charging Station,Simple charging station. Current rate is less that what is actually need to charge 2 controls at the same time.
4,Charging station,This product works great. It fits right on top of the ps3. It even has cool blue lights on it and makes charging easy
3,charger,worth the price that i bought it for. works well and saves me time on charging my controllers. worth buying if ur stuck with charging one contoller at a time.
1,Paper Weight,"This unit is terrible. Never once fully charged one of my controllers. It looks really cool when it is plugged in, but did not do what it was supposed to do. This is nothing more than a neat looking accessory. I definately would not suggest purchasing this."
2,Cheap and fragile,"Im not complaining about the price. It was something like 8 bucks, but the materials are cheap and the build is fragile."
4,Great value,"The price you pay for this charger is actually good for what you are getting. I was surprised about the overall quality. Pretty happy with it, looks nice with the blue lights and charges the controllers without a trouble."
1,dude these things suck,"dude these things suck when i put in the controller the minie usb bent, i hate these thing and that just prooves how bad they are."
1,***WARNING*** DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,"I'll make this review short and sweet. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK! Not only did it stop working the first week I've had it, but it also managed to totally fry both of my DualShock 3 controllers!"
2,not to happy,its charge great but the blue light what out .. that sucks! .. its is what it is.. what can you do
2,NO POWER CORD ????,It did not come with a power cord ????How am I support to charge my controler with out a power cord ?????
3,Pretty Good,Decent charging dock and the lights look cool. I wanted to wall mount it so I unscrewed the back plate and made two key hole style notches in it with a dremel so that I could mount it on the wall in my AV closet. I would give it more stars but sometimes you have to really go slow to connect the controller to it and line it up. That might be because of how I mounted it though.
3,Great for the price,Its made of plastic and has a cheap feel but it does what its supposed to and has a good look. Like another reviewer remarked it is redundant purchasing a charger that has to be connected to the PS3 although a socket adapter is a good work around. My only concern now is that I'm not sure when the controllers are fully charged and how long I can leave them connected to this without damaging them.
1,Nonfunctional,"I thought about buying this product to load my controls As long as you'm resting and I'm not playing with the PS3 but it turns out this Dock requires the PS3 is turned on so you can load the controls. I do not see any function to it, because if you're not playing you will not leave your PS3 on to charge the controls. Too bad it is not recommended"
3,Good product,this product is good. I do not like how it works. It seems not to load the controls. I use it occasionally
2,"Works Great, Cheap Product.","The reason why this product deserves only 2/5 stars is that It was all plastic, even the ""plastic chrome"". I bought this as a gift for a family member because it was ranked 4/5 stars at the time, with very little complaints for a descent price too! But like the saying goes you get what you pay for. I just kept it for myself because it still works but it is not worthy of a ""gift"" item.Pros+Blue Lights Look Great+Connects With easeCons-Cheap, Super Cheaply Made.-Broken Arm Bars that hold Controller-Rattling Sound inside (If you reserve one with a broken arm bar)Wishes: It was made of more durable plastic, or even some type of thin pressed metal."
4,Good product for your money,"This does exactly what it's stated to do, although it's kind of silly how you have to use their USB cable which is kind of short. Also, the blue light can't be turn off when they're charging so except a blue glow in the room."
4,love this,blue light around the ps3 makes system stand out helps me charge my 2 remotes at the same time could not charge my head set do does not fit
4,good,"So great and even better for the price. unfortunately, when I bought a 2nd controller to charge on it, I bought a controller that didn't work!"
5,It's working good,"I bought it about 5 months ago and It's still working good, charge 2 controllers at same time. Some complaints about its cheap material but for $9.99 I found it worthy."
3,Ok item. Good Price,Great price. Item wasnt to my extend. You have to place the remotes in hard in order to charge them. Didnt come with wire to plug. Had to reserach what you were able to use to make item charge the PS3 remotes.
5,xbox,This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website
2,no good,"if you no have the power or the cable, can't be useful, this information you have to tell with initial instruction"
1,Simply does not work.,"This product does NOT work properly. The pretty little blue lights come on, but it does not charge the controllers, which is the whole point of having it. I checked everywhere and there is no switch. The documentation is vague and obviously written by someone with English as a second language. PASS on this. Even if some of them work, do you really want to roll the dice? The shipping to return it is as much as it costs to begin with..."
3,IT WORKS!!! FOR ONLY PS2 GAMES?!?!,"My Charger only works when I put in a PS2 game. Whenever I try to put in a PS3 game and charge it does not work. I cannot bring myself to understand why. The glow of the charger is a nice look, but take my advice and go somewhere else for a charger."
3,You get what you pay for,"Great product for under 10 bucks. However, bought in march, now doesn't charge controllers. It is now june. Not very long, not a lot of life in this product"
5,Works.,"Other reviewers need to return defective products instead of complaining about them. I don't play my PS3 often, but I do always have my controllers on here charging. For 4 months, they've come off and on and done exactly what I paid for this thing to do.It's cheaper made than it appears in the picture, but look at the friggin' price and don't complain. If you want an easy charging station so you dont have to go USB direct to the PS3, buy it and enjoy it.IF ITS BROKEN, RETURN IT."
3,Great deal for $6,IT came broke. I fixed it with super glue. and it works just fine. It was $6 I wasnt expecting super fantastic quality. It was worth every penny and looks great charging my PS3 controllers.
1,Don't buy it!,"First attempt at purchasing this product ended in never receiving it. The seller was Eforcity. Second attempt at purchasing this product ended in receiving a defective unit. The seller was Worldwide Sales. Only one of the two charging stations functions. Due to this defect, it does not offer any advantage over just plugging in the PS3 controller to a USB mini cable. Bah!"
4,Good product overall,"I got this in the mail and my first reaction was that this seems like a cheap product because it didnt come in a box, was EXTREMELY light, and there was some rattling inside. But I was wrong. It's actually a decent product. It works perfectly, charging my ps3 controller with no problems at all. Worked well straight out of the package and comes with a USB cord if you dont have one. Also emits a blue light. Might buy one for my brother. Just to add a con though, I could not track my package at all so you'll just have to wait til it comes."
5,Controller Life,If you are going to stay in the game this is the way to do it. So glad I found this and the price was right.
4,"It works, but...","The docking station works, but not when connected to my PS3. When connected to the Playstation, the lights on bottom flash and no lights on controller are active. However, when i connect the dock to a wall outlet and mini usb from an old cell phone i had, the blue indicator lights are steady, and the flashing red lights on the controller work properly. i took a star away for it not working on my console, but it looks cool, works for the most part, and cost me 6 bucks.....6 bucks. Get the docking station."
4,GREAT DEVICE,"Yes this product is great, my boys play with their Play Station quite often so they needed this to keep charging their controllers.The best part for me is that it a nice blue glowing effect at the bottom and when the lights are off it looks great."
4,Great deal for the price and functionality,"The TV is one of the cheapest in the market. For the price, I was surprised at the number of HDMI connectors available. For that matter, this TV provides 3 HDMI, 1 component, 1 Composite, 1 VGA(DSUB) Audio RCA jacks, optical and digital outputs and Cable/Air coax connectors.The remote is not that great. Considering that Viewsonic is a relatively new TV brand, not many remotes support it. So making this remote a learning remote would have been nice. As it is, it does not power on my Denon AVR. Also, in some cases, it does not send out anything when I press ENTER (like for the TV Guide of the cable box). Strange...Other than that, colors are great, it does upto 1080i and is a huge improvement from my old 32"" tube."
1,good but misleading!,fits well with most speakers but i only recieved one mount when the ad looked like it was for a pair(2) of mounts.
5,cats and dogs...,"I found this novel to be very enjoyable. It's about Jack Smith and family living on Mount Washington and all the animals who show up in the process. It is heart-warming (as his writing usually is)and insightful. His style of writing is simple, concise and refreshing, definetly So. California style."
2,Depressing,"i quit reading after the first few chapters. He didn't take care of his animals,just allowed them to roam, and they died horrible deaths as is usually the case when pets are allowed to run loose.People think pets are happier running free, but their life spans are usually tragically cut short. If you don't take time to know your pet as an individual,you may think it's easily expendable."
5,Just What the Trainer Ordered!,"This is just the book I was looking for. It is overflowing with ideas for tricks to teach your dog, games to play as a group or individually with dogs, and ideas for very inexpensive equipment that you can build all with just one sheet of plywood! This author has ideas that a new and refreshing. This will not doubt become a great reference book for my puppy class students and we are all looking forward to getting the next book ""More Fun and Games with Dogs""!"
3,Jung on Schizophrenia,"This is Volume 3 of the Collected Works of Carl Jung (1875-1961), ""The Psychogenesis of Mental Illness"". Most of the volume consists of his general thoughts on ""Dementia Precox"" & schizophenia. As insightful as Jung is in general, these are not the most illuminating writings. In light of recent neurobiological work on the origin and treatment of schizophrenia, this primarily psychoanalytic approach to the condition will seem passe, to say the least. The practical value of these writing in the treatment of persons suffering from schizophrenia is minimal. The volume would be most valuable for someone who wanted to understand the edifice of Jungian thought as a whole; in that context, some of these writings, in presenting Jung's understanding of the psyche as a dynamic system, would elucidate further his remarks about archetypal psychology in other writings."
3,Nails the Jane Austen formula,"Jane Austen wrote 11 chapters of this book before dying, and in this book ""Another Lady"" picked up the fragment and finished off the story. It's set primarily in the fictional seaside village of Sanditon, which some of the locals are trying to develop into a summer destination. A lot of funny material about hypochondriac characters (the sea air can be good or bad for them, depending on the circumstances) and selfish rich people. The hero, characterized primarily by the non-Austen author, was witty and entertaining, and I had fun along with the heroine at trying to guess his hidden motivations. I forgot how good Jane Austen is at developing multi-dimensional characters she then proceeds to skewer -- the rich old lady in this book is a great example of someone who doesn't consciously realize how selfish and cheap she is and the trouble that causes other people, but you understand how she ended up that way."
4,Very Enjoyable,"This book is way outside my normal reading range, but I have to confess a love for Jane Austen's stories. A friend gave me this book and I honestly thought I wouldn't enjoy it as much as one of the usual Jane Austen books. I was wrong, it was very enjoyable. The ""other lady"" that finished up the book did a pretty good job of hitting the basic Jane Austen tone, pitch and pace with the story. There were a few sections that seemed to drag or amble in some odd directions, but on the whole, a very enjoyable read."
2,A dissapointment,"I am an avid Jane Austen fan and was delighted to find this book, thinking I have surely read all her works. Perhaps the two stars I've given this piece is too harsh--it is in contrast with her other works that so few stars are given. The first portion of this book, the one Austen wrote, was surprisingly dull. The characters did not have the ""life"" one comes to expect from Austen. The second part of the book definitely ""picked up"", but seemed more like a Victoria Holt novel, than Austen. On the whole, it was more memorable to me as a disappointment than as anything else."
3,"on jane austen and ""another lady""","Not one of Jane Austen's better beginnings. I appreciate the effort of ""another lady"" and her comments at the end. The first chapters (Austen's)are vague. ""Another lady"" takes the characters in different directions, and introduces new ones. There seemed to be a lack of character development, but by the middle, ""another lady's"" plot with its twists and complications makes you forget all that. A very enjoyable read, but only to the reader intent on reading all of Jane Austen's works. Nothing, in my opinion, will ever compare to Pride and Predjudice and Sense and Sensibility!"
4,Nice Finish,"This book, Sandition, was started by Austen and completed by ""another lady"" since Austen died before her story was done. Austen made it to chapter 11, and that is where ""another lady"" takes over. There is a definite difference in the writing; you can just tell that the remainder of the book is not true Austen. The chapters are longer, the characters are more bold and outwardly flirtatious and romantic, and the writing, while very Austen, just isn't authentic. However, the book was just as fun as Austen's many others. Who knows if this is how she meant for it to go, but it's an interesting tale nonetheless."
3,enjoyable,"I always feel that a book which is completed by a different author to the one who began it, is just one reeader's view of what happens next. We can all make up our own minds about what happens, if something happens that we don't like, we can always tell ourselves that it didn't really happen. As it is, I enjoyed Sanditon, but not as much as a full blown Jane Austen book. I found some parts a bit unbelievable, and the wit was lacking. However I liked the ending."
5,As good as Jane Austen herself,"I am so excited to finally own this book. I had read this before and thought that the auhor did a wonderful job of keeping close to Jane Austen's style of writing. I was even impressed by the fact that she refused to take credit for her writing by having a pen name of: ""Another Lady"". I thoroughly enjoyed this book again and am happy to be able to read it whenever I want. It came in excellent condition and very quickly."
5,One of my favorites,"I love this book. I love Jane Austen. The author did a lovely job finishing this story. Her style is not that of Jane's (and she herself admits that), but it is a wonderful style - witty, engaging, intelligent and just plain fun. I couldn't put the book down and continue to pick it up several times a year for a re-read. It's one of the books I go to when I have a few extra hours and want to escape into the world of wonderful literature. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fabulous few hours.And I must add, this would make a FANTASTIC movie."
4,Sunrise to Sunset,"Wright's latest offering, Sunrise to Sunset, is a big step forward from his debut. Simplistic melodies meet textured acoustics to create a pleasant, summer offering. Wright sings about themes of going to Heaven (Heaven), the need for personal redemption (Take My Life), the hope to start over (Sunrise to Sunset) and gratitude to God (Thank You). The disc sounds eerily similar to Mat Kearney's recent debut, but that is a good thing. Combining a bit of hip/hop, some light rap, a bit of reggae and placed over acoustic pop and you have Sunrise to Sunset."
4,this guy's got potential,"I was, perhaps, slightly dissapointed in this CD. Although it's really not bad. I had heard that he was a little like Mat Kearney. Well, he's not as artistic. He's somewhat lacking in the lyrics department. But he's still got some fairly good stuff like, ""Spirit Move"" ""Walking on Water"" and a few others. I kind of think he needs to do his ""folk hop"" or ""folk rap"" a little differently. He's definitely not a rapper. But I think he could improve.I will say this...this man has a heart for God. Praise God that we have talented singers like Paul Wright in this world."
3,Simple but nice,"These are nice darts, just nice but not cute, rough finish and because the plastic shaft are ugly and weak, buying a metal shaft is a must. A little delayed the delivery but it wasn't Supplier's fault. Very good attention by email"
3,Should have went to Walmart,"Im disappointed in this table. After reading the reviews I had higher expectations. It's not that it's a horrible table, it's just not worth the money I purchased it for. It is poorly constructed and the glass insert was too big for the table top. It is also a lot smaller than I anticipated. Like a previous review said, I think I could have purchased the same table at Walmart for much cheaper fully assembled."
3,Good looking,"This table is good looking but a little shorter then I expected. It is well bit and I didn't hear any grumbling from my husband when he put it together! Although he is very handy! Anyway, the stain is nice and it is a very pretty peice."
4,Great table for a good price,"I didn't like how the inside ring that you can see through the glass is not stained the dark espresso color, I had to paint it but it wasn't difficult. Great table."
5,very classy side tables!,"Love these tables - they look much more expensive than they are. Nice, sturdy, easy to assemble. I highly recommend them!"
2,wouldnt buy online,"After reading these reviews, I seriously doubt I would get the table unbroken. Because the UPS and handling guys don't care to use proper care with most fragile products. And it may not come with all the parts! That's how they rip you off of your money, get you to think that its a good deal when its not. I think I may get the table but I'm going to Walmart after these reviews."
4,You get what you pay for,"This end table looks very nice in our family room but you get what you pay for. One of the pre-drilled holes to insert the screws was way off and had to drill the screw in with a drill. Also the end table comes with little wood plugs to hide the screws which you can see through the glass... great idea but only 4 of the 8 plugs actually fit, I had to glue them in as they were way too small."
5,great end table,This is a great end table for a small space. I have a small living room and if fits perfectly with mt leather couches . Love it color is great. They were easy to put together. Even bought the tv stand that matches. I have had no problems. Some of the pieces didn't fit perfectly toghether but over all loved products.
2,Cheaply made,This table is cheaply made and poorly constructed. The screws used for assembly did not secure the legs and I had to use wood glue to make stable. Would not recommend this product even at half the price.
2,dissapointed,"I originally bought this table for a night stand in my bedroom. When i recieved them the glass was cut wrong and wouldnt fit in the cut out. The other had scrapes all over it, so now they are in my guest bedroom, where they are rarely seen."
3,The photo is not 100% accurate,"It's ok, the table was not stained underneath and it shows through the glass. My husband had to stain the underneath."
1,Cheap,"This product looks obviously cheap if you look at it from less than 5 ft away. The paint is too thin. The wood comes chipped in numerous places. The glass is too small for the cavity and moves if touched. It's good to look at from a distance but if you're planning to place this where guests can get up close, choose something else."
3,Little Black Table,The table is great and putting it together was easy. The only problem with the table is that the glass was scratched. I liked the table so much that I decided not to send it back for the scratched glass.
2,sooooooo close,Nice table thats so close to deserving its 4 stars. it misses it by a 25 cent part. They say dont over tighten the camlocks--believe them! This is some cheesy cast alloy. It breaks with a couple lbs Tor. If they dont upgrade this atleast they could include a couple extra. Advice: set the lock screw depth carefully. If its slightly too deep--IT WILL BREAK THE CAMLOCKS! Also be advised price is variable. Paid 60$. Logged in 1week later to review & its now 80$
2,Disappointed,The wood on the inside (viewable under the glass) was not stained. It is unfinished wood. It would otherwise be a nice looking table.
1,winsome wood & glass end table,Very flimsy and wobbly. Not happy with the construction and would not recommend this product. It will not last more that 6 months. Used as a nightstand.
4,Side table,I was very pleased at the quickness of the delivery. this table was very simple to assemble and once completed was seemingly sturdy. It is dark espresso in color almost black and very contemporary. I am still thinking of purchasing an additional side table.This is a nice addition to my living room space.
3,Okay Table But Need to Stain,I purchased these tables for my theater for guests next to the recliners. That tables are fine for the price. However since it has a glass top the inside of the table below the glass should have been stained as you see bare wood. Not a big deal as we are going to stain ourselves but the manufacturer should have thought about that as it looks unfinished.
3,End table missing some color.,"The tables are very cute. They went together very easily, but they are missing something. The inside ring of the table that you see through the glass is a very light oak color. The picture shows that the tables are Espresso colored all over. This can easily be painted, but more work than what I had wanted."
3,Mixed response,"Overall, product is ok.ProsMade of wood. Staining is good. Texture comes out good and you can see wood grains.Overall finish is good.Cons:The wood quality is not good, light, soft wood is used, so the legs are more vulnerable to break.Inner areas are not stained, so, you will see unstained areas through glass top.Legs shake a bit, but not too bad.Price:Slightly overpriced. I think price should not exceed $50"
2,Looks OK from five feet away,"For $82.27 ($67.49 plus $14.78 shipping + handling), I expected a bit more than an end table that looks like I've already owned it for a year or so. Considering the quality of the finish, materials, assembly difficulty, etc., this end table should have been priced closer to 25 bucks. Steer clear."
3,Cute tables,Tables are cute and shipped quickly. Easy to put together. Only down side is they were smaller than they appear in the picture. More sofa tables than beside tables but not bad for the price.
3,Obviously made in China,"Roughly made with low quality wood. The one I received had big gouges in the wood, but they finished the product with it anyway. Obviously made in China as there was no QC. I returned it as the gouges would show, they were located on the round piece under the glass top."
3,"Product Great, Customer Service Not So Great","I love this side table, but when it arrived, the company had forgotten to place the hardware in the box. My husband called the company and after talking to two associates, they agreed to send out the parts. A week later, we still hadn't received anything. I called again and they said they just shipped out the parts the day before. A few days later, the parts arrived, but not everything was in the packet. Luckily, my husband is pretty handy and was able to find the parts he needed at a local hardware store. I've ordered A LOT of items from Amazon, and will continue to do so. But I will NOT be buying anything more from WINSOME."
5,Great table for the price!!,Came in excellent condition! Was great for the price! matches my new coffee table too!
4,Very nice,Nicely made and looks a lot more expensive than what I paid for it. Actually one of the best buys.
4,Buetiful,Amazing table loved It will say that when you put the srews you gotta really make it tight or else it will break or get out one day
4,Item is just as descrbed,"Ordered two of these tables and one side table with three shelves. The end tables were just as described. Constructive criticisms would be that of the two tables, one of the glass tops did not fit snugly into the carved hole in the top tier. It actually sticks out above the table plane. Luckily the table is in a corner not often used. The other criticism I have is that the wood that is exposed through the top of the glass is not painted. Its completely unfinished wood so you can see bare wood just by looking through the top of the table. Very noticeable. Ill keep these tables because they suffice for what I have paid for them. Great deal for the price. They look nice and serve their aesthetic and functional purposes."
3,Okay Table!,"Only gave them a three star because they arrived unfinished. The inside circle when looking thru the glass is unpainted and you are looking at raw wood. I did not send a formal complaint, it would be too costly from where I live to return or even exchange. This leaves me no option but to paint it myself. They are otherwise quite decent and sturdy."
2,cheap and it shows,It was cheap that's about as good as it gets. Assembly is with those dang bolts and alan keys that have lost the threading before you actually get it together. Then when you put the glass on it its not secure and one knock and its gone. then what disappointed me most was when you stand up and look through the glass you can see the cheap unfinished wood... disapointed!!
2,You get what you pay for!,"I love the shape of this table. The size is perfect in my bedroom next to my reading chair. Well packed, although the glass was chipped. That ends the positive things I can say about this table.Cheap,cheap,cheap!!!! Much smaller than it looks in picture, weird scale for a living room next to a couch. Wood not even finished on the inside rim, visible through the glass top. Wood sanded unevenly so finish is glossy then rough. Skip this table unless you are planning to use it as a side table in a small space and want to do some stain work to even it out...I gave it two stars only because I like it in my bedroom (although I bought it for my living room), it has a nice shape and stain color next to my reading chair. I am still annoyed when I look at it because I have not had time to stain the raw wood circle under the glass. I only kept it because repacking it to return it was too much hassle."
2,not fully finished,these tables are missing an important finishing touch....the interior wood on the top circular table top is not finished with the dark wood stain. which wouldn't be a problem if the table didn't have a clear class top. Therefore you can see the unfinished wood through the glass top.
3,It is what it is,It's a cheap table that fit my needs for work. i bought it simply to hold magazines in a waiting room at work. It does this fine.
2,"Retuned, dangerous for home with kids",The glass popped right out of the wood and it wasn't secured at all. Downright dangerous around kids. Poor quality. Returned.
4,excellent,"The table was exactly what it appeared on the site. fits the space perfect. love it, easy to put together. excellent quality for the money, Love it!!!!"
1,Failed to deliver,This book was not supplied. The seller claimed that the book was sold before they received the order but after I after I placed the order with Amazon.
5,An Excellent Soundtrack,"I personally thought that this is one great sequel to the Final Fantasy Series. I like the change and attitude that each individual piece played according to the game. The battle themes I thought were a lot better, adding a little of the rock flavor in it, like YRP battles No. 2 and No. 3. My personal favorite tracks are Under Bevelle, Destruction (when you fight Vegnagun for the last time), and Desmise (when you fight Shuyin). I like the feel of the music, almost desperate, a strive to win, whatever you want to call it. The music was good, the ending themes were incredible, it had the feel of todays top orchestral music scores. Matsueda and Eguchi are doing a MAGNIFICENT job as being Successors to Uematsu's music in the Final Fantasy Series. This soundtrack is a great step in achieving that. Hopefully they'll make Orchestrated Versions of the Battle Themes and Other Level themes from this game. All in all, this is a great soundtrack."
3,"It's pretty, but it's missing Nobuo Uematsu.","This is the first Final Fantasy OST in which the master of Final Fantasy music has not participated. And sadly, it shows. Over the years of Final Fantasy, we have come to expect certain musical strains... the bouncy Chocobo music most particularly.In the FF X-2 OST, the chocobo music only hints towards what it used to be, leaving one feeling like there should have been more to the music, as if a track were left on the cutting room floor.Don't get me wrong. The music is sweeping, elegant at points (Gagazet's new theme is among those tracks, ) and there are elements of a J-Pop-ish nature evidenced in the vocal theme ""Real Emotion"" and with Rikku and Paine's themes.Standing alone by itself, this OST has merit... but it just can't compare to the music of Uematsu. It just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy to me."
2,DONT BUY,"I bought this toy for my daughter and like the other parents I was mislead. It says ""Polly Pocket So Hot Snapshots"" on the internet diplay but when I recieved it the box says ""Stylin' Sticker Pics"". The discription misleads you to think that there is a camara when in fact there are only stickers. Dont spend $25 on this!"
3,It's this teacher's Vipassna style,You will enjoy Vimilaramsi's approach. It's up to you how far you want to go with it. You can even attend retreats at his meditation retreats to make more progress.
4,Hugeness,The board is solid. The case is extra solid. The velcro kind-of works since most pedals have stuff in the way - like feet or rubber pads - that you'll need to take off first. It's definitely sturdy and well made though. My beef is the size of the case - it's freakin huge! And heavy! So great for a road-warrior but not so great for a local band that doesn't stray too far from home. I'll have this forever though - I don't think it will ever break. I could drop it from a 3 story building and I think it'd be fine.
5,"great board, i've finally found what i was looking for","This pedal board is the answer to everything I'm looking for in a great pedal board. I had an SKB with built in power supply. The case was all molded, but the latches where attached pretty poorly, very crooked and the power supply was flaky. This case, however, has all the markings of a professional line. The quality of the case is amazing and the velcro strips are better quality than others."
4,Great read,Good read it has all the thrills and great story. i just started reading TWD comics but im hooked. awesome
3,At least the artwork is cool....,"**Spoiler alert**Ok, I have to say this one was tons better than the second one.The artwork was still cool. Their was a bit of mystery to the killing of two girls.So far, I think I like volume one the best. I haven't read the rest in the series, but hope to soon."
2,"LOVE the Comic, but NO ZOOM Feature on Kindle Fire","I love all the Walking Dead collections (books, comics and TV series) so I have no complaints with THAT. But it's hard to SEE the tiny fine print in this Kindle Edition collection (and the others too) of the comics since the Zoom feature seems to be disabled. I'm not even sure why they did it this way for the Kindle Edition since zoom works great in the Comic App. If the Zoom feature could be fixed - it would be perfect!"
1,save your money,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IM A ZOMBIE FAN.I WISH I SAVED MY MONEY.THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A GUY WHO IS A COP AND HIS WIFE IS CARRYING SOME OTHER GUYS BABY.WHEN THEY ACTUALLY STOP JUMPING IN AND OUT OF BED WITH EACH OTHER THE BATTLES WITH THE ZOMBIES IS QUIT BORING.AND OF ALL PLACES TO BUILD A NEW LIFE THEY TRY TO DO IT IN A PRISON.HOW STUPID.LESS SEX AND MORE ACTION THIS STORY DESPERATELY NEEDS.RENT A GOOD ZOMBIE MOVIE WITH YOUR TEN BUCKS INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS GARBAGE.
5,arrived quick and in perfect shape. will use again!,"set up and packaged perfectly to make sure everything was safe. arrived quickly, i will for certain use this shipper again. the walking dead is a great graphic novel, and picking up more popularity of the show as well. all deserved!"
1,Trust me - don't waste your time!,"I realize I may have high expectations, but I generally expect that a film's title bears some relevance to the storyline.In this 85-minute yawn-fest, the town doesn't actually ban Christmas until 67 minutes into the movie (and it's banned for a lame reason, at that). Christmas is promptly reinstated 10 minutes later at the 77-minute mark, although viewers aren't privy as to exactly *why* (the main character goes into the courthouse and returns shortly after to triumphantly announce that Christmas has been reinstated). Need I say more?Viewers can then spend the last 8 minutes regretting that they just wasted their time with this movie, and wondering how it ever got made in the first place. Unfortunately, those are two things I end up doing more often than I'd like. The only thing that could've made this movie worse is if I actually spent money to rent it, but fortunately I got it as a free MVP rental at Hollywood Video."
3,Shut off analysis & kick back and laugh,"Given the competition for the smaller audience in theaters this is a DVD only video. I purchased it used at Amazon and the kids and I got a good laugh. If you purchased ""The Town that Banned Christmas"" looking for another ""Gone with the Wind"" you will be disappointed. That being said, if you would like a very light hearted ""goofy but funny"" escape and view this DVD with your kids/grand kids to watch the zaniness you will find some funny moments in this tongue in cheek in the ""Dumb and Dumber"" Jim Carry style movie (which I loved). Do not look at it for deep analysis or just to find fault and you will have an interesting take on those who think Christmas is all about out decorating and out doing your neighbors. Sadly I still can't give the video over 3 stars given the belated long build up plot and the short ending of the movie and its over the top acting."
5,Suspenseful and Funny,"I thought the book was hilarious. I would recommend it to all the kids. My favorite part was when Grakker had the Bizerk module in his head and he was trying to get out of the lunchbox saying ""Bad wall, bad wall"". Buy this book!"
5,Aliens Ate My Homework,"I used this book as a group read aloud for my second grade class. They loved it. Each day you could hear a pin drop when it was time to see what the aliens were up to.My teenaged daughter had read this book when she was in sixth grade and still remembers it from then. It was one of her favorites!It appears to be a book for all ages of children. They relate to the aliens and their ""far out"" ways.The ending chapters were a cliffhanger, and we found the ending a bit of a surprise. We had tried to second guess the conclusion.I would definitely read this again. Even one of my second graders asked me where I got the book. He wants to have his mom read it to him over the summer. I plan on giving it to him for his end of the year gift."
4,Fine entertainment for a beginning reader,"This is a cheerful and well-written alien/space adventure that features a well-rounded and appealing young hero. Coville avoids the hip ironic sub-text that mars many early readers, and tells a straight forward story of adventure and suspense. I can see why a young reader would like this and would feel a certain sense of satisfaction after finishing it. There is also less emphasis on zaniness, (like, say, in ""The Time Warp Trio"" books), so you get the feeling you are reading a beginner's novel, with a plot, characters, tension and resolution. So, you get fun and entertainment, but you also get to read a real book. Not bad for beginners."
3,"It wasn't the dog , but an alein who ate his homework","Humor and the playground bully mix in this book to give a pleasantsci fi that no one is ever going to take seriously.One of the objects of sci fi and ofchildren's book in general, is that they are supposed to teach the reader something,not just entertain.Although well written and pleasant,there is little information or morals taught here.I suppose that it is a crime to be cruel might worth something."
5,Great,"This was a very good book. I read it in one 2 hour space one afternoon. I just couldnt put it down, but somebody said that the others in the I Was a Sixth Grade Alien series are better, so I want to try them out too. I would highly recommend this book, and hope that you will enjoy it!"
3,BORING BOOK,"The book was good but not as good as the other Bruce Coville has written. ""Aliens ate my homework"" is entertaining but I think it would have been better if it was a lot more about the aliens not Rod's problems. The climax was almost like another little conflict in the book. This book wasn't a very good book. I suggest you read another book besides this one.The author doesn't put a lot of stuff that can interest you. He'll jump from Rod getting hurt to the school project and just entertains you and doesn't make it as interesting as he could. If I could I would change the aliens needing a tube to enlarge their ship. I didn't like what the author did when they landed in Rods room. Why would aliens eat paper mashie."
4,It is an all-around good book .,"I think that the way Rod's space friends help him makes this book more enjoyable and fun to read. When he meets BKR, it's time for the thrill of the chase!"
3,An ok book,I thought this book was pretty good. I liked how it was adventurous. There isn't to many things that i didn't like about it but i just didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i would. I would recomed this book for people who are looking for a kids adventure book.
1,"""Aliens Ate my Homework""","The book that I read was called ""Aliens ate my Homework!"" by Bruce Coville. I would not recommend this book for anybody. I would rate it a one star. The reasons are: One there wasn't any suspence in the story you could finger out most of the things that were going to happen. The story didn't have a climax. There wasn't a surprise ending and there was no twist in the story. The main character is Rod Allbright and they really don't explain much about him. There was really not a steady setting. They were at school, houses, a field, and a front yard. The theme was not clear."
5,"""Aliens Ate My Homework, Miss Maloney!""","This book is about Rod Allbright, a boy who just can't lie. Ask him a question, and you're sure to get a good answer. Well, at school, He has a big enemy named Billy Becker, A tiny little kid who can beat up every kid in the sixth grade. You would think Rod would fight back, but he can't fight. But all this bad luck changes when a minuture alien ship comes, with a few visitors in it. Soon Rod gets to get fond of them, and feels like he wants them to stay. Well, they do stay, because they need to catch a high-security criminal who did the worst crime in all of the Galaxy: cruelty. And his name is BKR (Bee Kay Are). This story is a great book with lots of wonders. I hope you, too, will read this book and find out the fun of it all!"
4,Aliens Ate My Homework,"Lots of Fun!! Aliens Ate My Homework is an intriguing story about a little boy who is thrown head first into a science fiction adventure. Rod, the main character, is enlisted to search out a space criminal hiding here on Earth with the help of his new found extraterestrial friends. This book is as exciting as it is delightful. The story is not only well written but is appealing to boys and girls alike. While the entertainment value of this book is high, the honesty of Rod is most impressive. With so much dishonesty in the world and the saturation of our children in it. I find this truthful character to be a refreshing change. I would suggest it to all. My class loved it!"
4,walther p22,yesterday i got the walther p22 not the clear versoin but the black. this gun is pretty good it shoots better than my bb gun.I would say the acuracy is about80ft or 70ft cuase I shot a little coke can from about 100ft away.the cualking isnt really hard. this is a good gun for its price. oh ya I forgot to tell u something if u keep on cualking it the plastic bbs will fall out. that is good for when u are done shooting to get the extra bbs out. i hope this review is helpful
3,Good looking if painted. unaccurate.,"This P22 softair pistol is fun to shoot. I bought the clear version and painted it black, now it looks like a real Walther P22. it seems rather unaccurate. always shoots down and to the left. i can shoot up and to the right but its not always consistent either. would rather have a more accurate pistol. buying a real P22 soon..."
5,REALLY GOOD I MEAN REALLY REALLY GOOD,THIS PISTOL IS DA BOMB I SAY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PISTOL OR A P99 OR A DESERT EAGLE BECAUSE THESE PISTOLS ARE DA BOMBCAN YOU DO THIS ¿ OR &#9612;OR THAT OR EVEN THIS &#9554;
2,i like this gun- but it kinda sucked,if you do get this gun- you might as well get it at a place like Big- 5 cause i got it there for $20. It broke for me fairly quikly and wasnt even a very good gun to begin with.
3,its ok,it broke the first day i got it my dad had to drill a hole in it to get the bulet out then it broke again and i had to take it apart oh and NEVER TRY IT WITH THOSE PAINT BALLS geuss what it broke its your choice thought
5,Shaves and trims.,"Great, compact trimmer that's easy to use. Just like the less expensive version (which I owned for about three years before it died) but also includes a shaver head. Having read reviews for the cheaper shaver-free model, let me quickly explain that the other one is just a trimmer and does not shave. This one DOES shave. So if you want to be able to trim as well as shave, fork out a few extra dollars for this model."
1,Eh...,"This product is pretty puny. Definitely not for shaving, as I knew to begin with...but it hardly works for shaping and trimming either. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Good trimmer, but not for shaving!",Trimmer is good for under arm etc... but still the hard fiber/plastic comb hurts and leaves scratches if pressed too much. Not great for groin area and the shaver is kinda useless. I am gonna try Philips Norelco BG2020 Men's Bodygroom instead of this!
1,Prosper the Joyce Meyer Way,There's this book and then there's the truth. Really want to prosper the way Joyce Meyer does?1.) Get in to hustling religion to unhappy people.2.) Charge for it-charge BIG for it.3.) Write one book and then write a bunch more saying basically the same thing the first book says.4.) Get a face-lift.5.) Tell everyone who listens to you that they are free to disagree with you as long as they are aware that by such disagreement they are bound for an eternity of torture and misery.There you are. You've just prospered the Joyce Meyer way.
4,I'd say this is their best.,"Unlike VOA's two previous releases, I'd say this one is actually pretty good. They have a new female vocalist who, while faulting only a bit on her lower notes, really outshines the old vocalist when she goes for those higher notes. The songs are also a lot better. They still maintain the band's creative symphonic metal sound, but also have some catchier choruses, some nice guitar solos and some excellent drumming. Some really touching duets between the male and female vocalist are featured also.The CD's only downfall would have to be its lyrics. The words can get a bit corny at times. Lines like ""I'm so sorry 'cause you're dead"" don't do it for me, personally. It'd also be nice if the vocalists put a bit more emotion into their voices and concentrate on what they're singing about instead of getting a perfect, crystal clear sound.I'd recommend it, nonetheless, for symphonic metal fans."
3,Visions of Atlantis; CD,"Not bad, but the band needs a couple of songs that make you want to listen to it over and over. I didn't find it with this band."
5,Very creative!,I was very pleased with the vocal and instrumentals in this CD. I am part of an older audience but I completely enjoyed this music.
4,OE Parts are best,This pump arived with a little bend in one of places the hose attaches too. It bolted on and worked great.
1,Terrible,"I was hoping to gain some respect for Islam as a religion, but the book only gave me farther proof that it is a complete sham. Islam fails to even come remotely close to answering the questions of the human dilemma, and instead offers its followers a set of rules that blind them to their real need."
3,Product Description,"I didn't see a way to put the actual tracks into the Product Description so I'll just do a slight review.This is a DVD of LIVE concert footage, all of which seemed very old to me. The start of it says ""Hudson/Street in Association with New Media presents ROCK THE WORLD"".The tracks are...TRACKS :01. Aerosmith - Rag Doll02. The Allman Brothers - Statesboro Blues03. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Proud Mary04. The Doors - The End05. David Bowie - space Oddity06. Pink Floyd - See Emily Smile07. Aerosmith - Sweet Emotion08. T. Rex - Bang A Gong (Get It On)09. Santana - Evil Ways10. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Green River11. Rod Stewart - Maggie May12. The Kinks - You Really Got Me13. Santana - Medley : Tales Of Kilimajaro, Black Magic Woman, Gypsy Queen14. The Doors - When The Music's OverHope this helps anyone else out a little."
5,Excellent sounding DVD,"Watching these great artists preform at the height of their popularity was awesome. The tracks that stick out to me are the Aerosmith, The Doors-both tracks were from different performances and as far as I know are new to DVD, Santana-fun to watch and excellent sound,CCR. Even the pre MTV clips of Pink Floyd, Bowie, T Rex were fun to watch I would highly recommend any classic rock fan to have this DVD."
3,Leaven in the lump,"I hate to give this commentary only three stars. Its specialty is its biblical-theological nature. McConville interprets each passage in the light of the broader theology of Scripture. Rather than appraoching each passage as though it stood alone, he excels at synthesizing it with the broader theological context. So for an interpretation of Deuteronomy that is scripturally broad and thought-provoking, this is the one. However, McConville has been strongly influenced by James D.G. Dunn. McConville's interpretation of one of the most important passages in Deuteronomy (30:1-14) is strongly influenced by Dunn's maverick interpretations of Romans 10 (which quotes Deut. 30:11-14). I was very disappointed that McConville, who often shows real insight in disproving liberal opinion, swallowed Dunn hook, line, and sinker."
1,Hated it!,I could not get through the first few chapters of this book because the grammar felt so attrocious to me. I grew way too tired of the way the author chose to write the book that I found myself thinking that someone else could've told it way better. It could've been so much better in my opinion.
5,Hilarious!,"It is worth the price of this DVD just to hear one of the Hessians tell of the time he had to get another club member to finish his city bus route because he was too wasted on dope to figure out where he was supposed to go next!These guys might be old, and the club might be on the downward slope, but they sure as hell ain't H.O.G. members! They ride, and probably still kick ass if need be....."
3,Pretty cool,Interesting!!! Nice to hear stories from the good old days. Learned a few interesting things wish them the best. Thanks
3,Wonderful if it had not been broken!,"I ordered this item three (3) times, only to have it arrive BROKEN ALL THREE TIMES! The packaging was not solid enough to protect the antlers and ears on the deer head. The Deer Trophy Hunting Shelf itself was a handsome piece and I would have enjoyed giving it as a gift at Christmas to my son-in-law who hunts. However, until they find a better way to package the item, I'm afraid you're wasting your time purchasing it. The Customer Service was outstanding. The credits for my return came through almost immediately and I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller."
2,Steeler-American Metal The Steeler Anthology,"Ok, this CD is a great archive of material of one of the most popular bands of the early 80's metal club circuit. It does fall short in a couple of areas though. The original single version of ""Cold Day in Hell"" is great, but it would have been better to have some of the songs from the original Steeler CD on this compliation just for the sound quality. What you get here are demo versions and live versions of the songs from the original release in sub par quality. The live versions are barely passable. You would need to be a serious Keel/Steeler/Yngwie Malmsteen to buy this CD."
2,Cheap and not working,I bought two boxes of these and the plastic spikes simply broke while I was trying to install them. And the lanterns are in full sunlight all day long and after 3 days stopped coming on at night. They are cheaply made but look very nice... I would not suggest these to anyone.
2,Outdoor Lanterns,Not pleased with these lights. The top must come off in order to get the lanterns ready to receive solar power but you cannot get it snapped back on.
1,Lousy Book,"This book does not contain specific information about Bullmastiffs. Except for the sections on breed standards and characteristics, all the other topics speak of dogs in general. I do not recommend this book. It's waste of time and money"
3,SUBTITLES OR CLOSE CAPTIONING WOULD BE HELPFUL,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I LEARNED THIS FIRST RATE BRITCOM WOULD BE RELEASED, IN ITS ENTIRETY, ON DVD. BUT THE SOUND LEVELS GO UP AND DOWN, AND MUCH OF THE CLEVER DIALOGUE IS LOST DUE TO LOUD SOUND EFFECTS, BACKGROUND NOISE AND MUSIC, AND THE INTRUSIVE LAUGH TRACK. THIS COULD ALL HAVE BEEN ALLEVIATED BY SUBTITLES OR CC - NEITHER OF WHICH IS PROVIDED. A SHAME."
3,Maple's Clock TCL06-333 Moving Gear Desktop Clock,"This review is for the Maple's Clock TCL06-333 Moving Gear Desktop Clock. I bought this present for my boyfriend ( now husband ) for Valentines Day. He is an engineer and loves these kind of gadgets. I placed batteries in the clock before I gave it to him. It worked for a little while, but within a month the hands gradually moved slower, making the time off track. My husband was please with the looks of this clock, but displeased with how it worked."
4,Cool to look at--Not the best timepiece,"I bought this ""Gear Clock"" for my middle school science class during a ""simple machines"" unit. It's decorative and the kids love watching it. I am a bit disappointed that, for the price, it doesn't keep very accurate time and needs monitoring and adjusting, espcially after weekends/vacations."
2,Don't hear much of a future for FUTUREHEADS,The only thing that distinguishes this band from most of the other new wanna-be New Waver bands is a distinct lack of musical talent.
2,"Haven't heard the CD, but I saw them live","I went to a Franz Ferdinand concert several months ago in San Francisco and they were the first opening act. Maybe it was the acoustics, or the bass being turned up WAY too much, but I wasn't particulary impressed. THough they obviously had a lot of energy, their songs seemed very repetitive and all had the same beat. Very talented group though, they just need some new songs."
5,Best New British Band!!,"First there was Franz Ferdinand who made a good album. The middle section is a little dull but overall it is good. Then the Killers come along and remind us that Duran Duran vocals is a huge factor in New Wave indie rock in which they made a great album.One might think the Libertines had sealed the deal with their debut album but after the follow-up we were wrong. The Futureheads debut knowing what to do to take the title of the best new british band in which they have in fact made, a perfect album. From the start of the album you are immediately drawn to the outrageous brit-vocals; these vocals alone make the album great. The Futureheads sound range from something like The Ramones, The Beatles, and the Hives. The Hives are a little crazier where as the Futureheads maintain rapid percussion combined with massive chord progression. Buy This Album NOW!"
3,Futureheads are indeed something to listen to,"I first heard The Futureheads opening up for Franz Ferdinand in Toronto. I was into them right away, good live show. I purchased the CD soon after and really dug their vocals. This Brit-pop-rock is chatchy and excellent to bounch around to. Pick up the disc, you won't be let down."
4,Almost perfect,"Why can't I stop listening to this? So catchy, so vivid, it makes me ever so happy. I suggest buying it and listening to it first thing in the morning to get the day started off right! It will either drive you crazy or put you in a good mood!"
3,Replace the drummer,"I 'get' the Furureheads but it just about misses, expecially if you give the CD repeated listens. The drummer is really really really monotonous. The singer sounds eerily just like the singer of The Cure. The lyrics are fun, but the songs sound too much like a guitar-centric version of Devo. I'd rather listen to Devo. It gets 3 stars for the lyrics.Someone compares them to the Ramones. Lord no. Dont insult the Ramones."
3,The Futureheads induce the scratching heads,"I have no idea how I came across this self-titled album from the Futureheads. At any rate, people seem to have different inferences on the band's vibe; to me, they sound like a modern-day version of the Cure. The way they put the songs together isn't bad per se, but the way they put the ALBUM together is what's odd.This is one of those albums that sounds like one long single rather than several separate songs; it's very difficult to distinguish one song from the next (except for ""Stupid and Shallow"", which is just that). And the fact that they breeze through fifteen tracks in 35 minutes shows a lack of substance. This album from the Futureheads might suit indie rock purists well, but I personally think they need a little more variety in their material.Anthony Rupert"
2,AAAAAAAAA! TREBLE OVERDOSE!,"This band would be decent if they didn't have the jangly piercing guitar and the extremely British singer. I admit, First Day is good, and so is A to B, but man, they need to do something about the production! It breaks glass!"
4,Charming debut: Jam meets XTC via Gang of Four on steroids!,"What was the last reviewing thinking? This is by far one of the freshest, most consistent, razor-sharp rock CDs in recent memory, certainly one of the best debuts of the year - imagine early JAM pyrotechnics, Gang of Four stop/start rhythms, and XTC wordplay/wit, and you've got the Futureheads - nice artwork, too - why aren't these guys on MTV...yet?! Too bad MTV doesn't play music videos anymore, leave that to Fuse I guess. At any rate, pick this up now - track for track, not a bad song in the bunch, PLUS an awesome cover of Kate Bush's Hounds of Love - good taste, less filling!"
4,REALLY SHOULD BE FOUR AND A HALF,"Great album...I've been listening to it since their show at South By Southwest in Austin, TX...odd rythms, but so damn catchy...favorites are:Le Garage-dop wop jangle punkDecent Days and Nights-great break down, one might say it rocksHe Knows-song structure sounds odd at first, but starts to really grow on youStupid and Shallow-love the guitar/voice scream towards the middle of the songHounds of Love-sorry Kate, but I like their version betterGive it a listen if you think rock music should make your body bop..."
4,Short & Hyper,"The Futureheads are an interesting mixture of many of my favorite bands. They have been compared to XTC but to me they sound more like a mixture of The Jam, Gang of Four, Devo and Barenaked Ladies [sorry]. The CD is unacceptably short [clocking it at only 36 min] but quality of the short songs makes up for quantity. Standout tracks include Robot, Decent Days and Nights, Carnival Kids, and The City Is Here For You To Use. Hopefully in the future these guys can write longer songs that people can get into.[DW]"
4,"Neither a kids' book, nor a waste of time","I must preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of anthropology and reading about fantastic cultures. M.A.R. (Phil) Barker has created a wonderfully alien world in Tekumel. The world is fully realized and full of mystery and a ""realness"" lacking in most fantasy and science fiction worlds.With that being said, I was disappointed that the novel downplayed the alien elements of Tekumel. The writing is acceptable and the plot is not anything spectacular, but that is not the point of these novels. Experiencing Tekumel is the reason to read them.If you are looking for a ""Great read"", then try something else. But if you are seeking to experience Tekumel or wish to be gently introduced to Tekumel, then this is one of the books for you.I hope that Prof. Barker produces more works in the future. And I hope that he delves deeper and deeper into Tekumel."
3,An interesting read for Tekumel enthusiasts,"I enjoyed reading this book, because I've always really liked the world of Tekumel. However, it's not one that I'd recommend to someone without that background knowledge and interest.MAR Barker has his flashes of brilliance, but isn't a natural novelist. A little too much of the book is spent explaining unfamiliar cultural, linguistic, zoological or botanical details for the uninitiated. I'd have like more characterisation, and a better developed and resolved plot.Still ... I've read a lot worse, and it *is* about Tekumel, which absolves a great number of literary sins."
1,THIS BROKE WITHIN 1 YEAR!,"I received this TV as a gift, and it came off the factory in Jan 2004, and it recently broke, the power connection and board totally had to get replaced, cost more than 120.00 to fix, almost enough for me to scrap the whole thing and buy another tv. It worked well until one day, it wouldn't turn on any more. Buyer BEWARE, after a year it could poop out on you. And it would not be under agreement any more! No reason should a tv stop working after 1 year.!!!"
1,Poor Customer Service From Toshiba,"I bought this tv and started having problems with it 4 months later, the tv turns itself off immediately after you turn it on. I was upset that it was one month out of labor warranty so I was going to have to pay $80 for repairs already. No one on the customer service lines at Toshiba was underdstanding or apologetic for this inconvenience. I had it repaired and am still having problems with it doing the same thing. Toshiba will not do anything about it until they hear from the service company which means I have to take time off work to drive it back to this service company. And still I have yet to hear one of their customer service reps apologize for sell me a lemon of a TV. I will never by Toshiba again. And I would never recommend them to anyone else that was looking for a TV."
2,DVD Broke in less than one year,I bought TV/DVD combo from retail store - DVD broke during the first year of use - just stopped working.
1,Not nice for the bedroom or any room!!!,"I got this tv for Christmas last year and it stopped powering on less than a year later. I am not sure how to fix it, and I have unplugged it. Tobisha is unaware of this problem. Unless you have a very nice extended warranty ( which is what Tobisha expects you to do apparently) you are going to have a dust collector instead of a tv. This tv is garbage. Save your money."
1,Terrible Customer Service from Toshiba,"I bought this tv and started having problems with it 4 months later, the tv turns itself off immediately after you turn it on.

4,"great CD, questionable product","This is the first CD of Katherine Jenkins I've owned.I discovered her while listening to Pandora Radio. It's a great compilation of songs but I have two issues.I do question why it came without any shrink wrap. It feels as though it's used but according to what I read, it's not.The second issue is that there are two places in this CD where the music stream ""skips."" It is distracting. It seems as though there was a technical error when reproducing the CD.Putting these two issues together makes me wonder -- what did I really buy?"
5,Wonderful CD,Katherine Jenkins is a wonderful opera singer she reminds me of Nana Mouskouri even though I don't consider Nana a opera singer the songs Katherine Jenkins sings are very similar to Nana. I would highly recommend Katherine Jenkins CD to any body that like opera and folk songs.Jason and or Peter.
1,DAYDREAM IS Katherine Jenkins New album NOT one fine day,"DaydreamLiving a dream is an album put out by Universal. Katherine is NOT signed by Universal and they put it out on the same day that Katherine released her new album ""DAYDREAM"" in order to confuse her fans and make money. On fine day is old material. Katherine signed a deal with another label and left Universal. They released this album and should be called on the carpet for it. If you want to hear Katherine in all her glory buy DAYDREAM"" which has her new music NOT I REPEAT NOT One fine day."
2,living a dream,she did her best to alienate any buyer who wants their music in english. too much foreign speak. good music gone bad.
1,Not very Impressed,"Expected something new and vivacious.Spends a lot of time with the proverbial english trilled 'R'...Not necessary.Compared to MANY others singing the same songs, I rank her towards the bottom...."
4,MEW MEW,"This is an okay manga in my opinion because its kind of like a waiting book. You know whats gonna happen, but you can't stop reading it. Also this book DOESN'T have a preview of the next book, so imma warning you! Don't expect to be able to learn anything, but expect to be able to read a GREAT manga!"
2,"Good book, bad software","The 2 books were very well presented, but the software was/is outdated, with no new updates. The practice exams did not function correctly. And the publisher is in the process of being ""revived"". So there are no new updates, or support at this time."
2,"thorough, but thoroughly unreadable","This is a standard textbook by a leading authority. There is little hand-waiving here. However, this is hardly a book to learn by.The typesetting could have been a bit better. I wish the proofs had been set off from the examples and the text a little more. There is also too much referencing to earlier equations. Rather than referring me over and over to equatin (6.2.1), just re-write the equation.Also, this book is starting to show its age. It is now 11 years old, so its bibliography is a bit outdated, as are references to computer programs.My most severe criticism of this book is that it is sorely lacking in explanations. There is little intuition provided here. Definately not an undergrad book. A much better text to learn from--but not as useful as a reference as this book is--is Burden and Faires. B&F make lots of use of pseudo-code and I applaud them for it. It helps detangle some of the math."
2,not what you might expect,"First of all, the flower shape that I thought I was getting is actually a star of David (six point star). Second, the little man shape has arms so tiny as to look ridiculous. Third, the round shape is not round, but really a heart."
4,"""Quick"" -- Read Krentz!","Award winning authoress Jayne Ann Krentz, who also is known by Amanda Quick for her historical romance novels, gives us exactly what this title indicates--grand passion. Flavoring her settings with descriptive tones of wealth and art add to Cleopatra Robbins (the central character)sensual and suspenseful predicament with handsome yet snobbish Max Fortune.I especially enjoyed scenes involving ""The Mirror""--a book which Cleo is writing that unmasks her hidden desires of erotica. And, you just know Max will buy into that, along with attempting to discover hidden art treasures.A fun, well written book which even authoress Sandra Brown commented, ""Grand Passion is Krentz at her best...with the snappy dialouge that has become her trademark and a cast of characters you want to know personally.""Thanks for your interest & comment votes--CDS"
5,Great book! Go get it!,This JAK books is one great story. You've got an interesting plot with a mystery to solve. You've got a hero and heroine who give new meaning to the phrase 'sexual tension'. A cast that is both funny and full of life and zest. One will not regret this read.
4,a remarkable search for family and love.,Jayne ann Krentz has done it again. Another winner! The characters immediately enfold you in their warmth and draws you in and makes you cry and laugh with them as (esp)Max tries to find the one thing he has lacked in his life and the others enfold him as they also enfold the reader.
3,If there was only a way to REALLY tell!!,"Descriptions of his experiences at Burning Man, trip to Nepal, Gabon, South America and his use of psychedelics ateach place. His dad, a Manhattan painter who never received any attention, dies. His girlfriend gets pregnant.(Why? Umm, no vasectomy?) A wealthy friend dies of an overdose of heroin. After a particularly vivid experience on DPT, he begins to believe there are other dimensions with other beings, most representing a plant-related aspect of their/this reality. However, the Western societal myths are inculcated to the point where he doubts his own experience, no matter how intense; so in the end, he can't quite bring himself to wonder if everything he's seen and felt is all (simply) a manifestation of his mind. Unfortunately, at least for Mr. Pinchbeck, there's really no way to tell? Good encouragement to run with the experience, though."
5,Awareness +1,"When it comes to opinions on the use of entheogens, a gulf or gap tends to immediately form around natural fault lines of discussion. Are substance-induced experiences merely 'hallucinations', or do they indeed break open the head and allow alternative or extra-sensory inputs to penetrate our everyday reality that is manufactured for us?The book details the author's quest to understand the otherness, mostly through the use of psychoactive substances. If you are at all interested in the world that lies next door, read this primer on the power plants to get an idea about what else it out there.Highly recommended - don't let the tight-sphinctered negative reviewers grind you down on this one. This is some next-level material that should be ingested, ruminated upon, discussed, and perhaps experienced."
4,Psychedelics and enlightenment in fearful and ignorant times,"Pinchbeck really did his homework here. Not only took most of the well known ""entheogens"" himself, but also read almost every book on the subject available at the time of writing. Here you'll find more much opinions, facts and thoughts about psychedelics than actual experiences, yet it is a very good read.It's an excellent first book on entheogens and psychedelics, and it points the way to read if you still want to know more about this subject, and believe me, you will."
5,Not Just a Book: a Journey,"What an excellent book. Daniel Pinchbeck has researched this topic and presented it in a logical fact based way and yet at the same time managed to make it an interesting read that didnt come off as being only logical and factual. Where there was data he presented it and when there wasnt, his own spin on things made you think. Its one of those books i didnt want to end and that to me is the sign of a good book. Well done Daniel!"
2,interesting but not well written,"definately an interesting subject, however, i didn't enjoy it much. the author, a self described neurotic, seems to be empty and searching for something, and the book seems to be more of a justification for him doing psychotropic drugs than a look at the role of the drugs in modern shamanism. the book is quite well researched but is sluggish and at times overbearing or pretentious. at one point he turns into a green peace rain forest advocate, which i don't see as having anything to do with shaman practice. if the subject is of interest to you, and this isn't the first book you have on the subject, there probably isn't anything new here for you. if you want to hear about his personal experiences, then buy the book."
4,visionary,"comprehensive, informative, surprising and endlessly entertaining. Makes for a welcome addition to other like-minded works in my library.At first I was put off by the author's apparent condemnation of Timothy Leary; but he makes up for this flaw by delivering one of the most comprehensive and well-written works on psychedelia I have ever read (and I've read a few!)This work takes the reader on a wonderful journey filled with intrigue and enlightenment. The author boldly explores some very interesting realms and comes out of it all with some very delectable and addictive theories about how to save the planet and save this race.I'll recommend this one to many friends."
5,spiritual alientation in the modern world,"If Marx addressed the problem of modern man's alienation from an economic perspective, Pinchbeck addresses the exact problem from a spiritual stance, not unlike Jung. In the argot of postmodernism, this is a ""readerly text. In other words, it's not something you'll use for your graduate thesis; but that's what I like about it: none of us is able to put forth our own personal ontology as something universal or objective. To do so would not only be a bore, but insufferably self-absorbed. Pinchbeck offers his experiences with wit and learned insight. Can't ask for more than that given the nature of the subject."
2,..,This book doesn't really have a clear focus. The most interesting parts are when he talks about his own experiences with the psychedelics
5,Jon Gibson Body & Soul,I've been missing this album for awhile now... the cassette monster ate it!It's So nice to have these special songs back in my life!
4,Meet the Madaris family and friends,"This is first in the trilogy about the Madaris brothers: Justin, Dexter and Clayton. The brothers are from a very close-knit family of six children. This is Dr. Justin Madaris' story. The oldest of the brothers, Justin's wife died ten years before the book opens. Justin is smitten with Lorren, but she's getting over the death of her marriage to a physically and emotionally abusive husband. To say she's ""gun-shy"" is an understatement. The good doctor has a prescription for what ails her. Loren has a pre-affair agreement I wished I'd thought of. The book is a great introduction to fictional friends you'll get to know better in Jackson's sequels about the trio."
4,No Printer Sharing via Windows XP,"Everything else works fine except for one. If the printer is hooked up to a computer running Windows XP, other computers on the local network will NOT be able to print to it. Canon admits to the problem, yet have no plan to fix it. A darn shame for this otherwise fine device."
4,So far so good,"... It was very easy to assemble and install. I particularly liked the small size as it fits right on my shelf where my old fax machine was. Compared to other units this was a real plus for me. The one draw back I have found is that printing envelops in a major pain! You have to remove the paper from the try, change paper thickness settings and load envelops. In my old HP I could just set an envelop on top of the existing paper and go. Other than that, so far so good. I love it!"
2,Great quality... when it worked,"Software was cumbersome. Great print quality. After three years of relatively light duty, the unit is completely kaput. Trashed scanner motor and printhead. I suppose three years is OK life out of a printer, but I'd hoped for more from Canon."
2,Terrible,"When i first got this printer i already new that i would use mostly for printing pictures on regular paper. well that has come out to be true, but wow i was wrong. the quality is extremely bad the pixels are sometimes as big as a millimeter by a milimeter! as for scanning, i could say that it's exeptional, but i don't use that feature much. copying is average at best. Text printing is the WORST there letters are like fraing blobbs. as for faxing a havent found any issues exept for speed which is a little slow. Now tha ti have had it with this printer i am getting a epson c82 because thats all i really need and the quality is very good, thats what i would recomend to you, or if you want these features i would recomend the epson cx5200 for only $... which is twice as cheap as this and at least twicew as good."
3,Think twice if you have an XP home network,"Just dandy if you have ONLY ONE COMPUTER, but I just got a new laptop with XP on it and bought this printer since I couldn't print with my existing printer on our network due to the XP upgrade. Nightmare city. A little insert in the box says their software doesn't support printer sharing in Windows XP. Why sell it then? Bottom line: if you have a home network and one of the computers runs XP, do yourself a favor and call every single printer manufacturer and ask them if their printer supports printer sharing over XP networks before you buy anything. I'm returning this thing tomorrow, and probably the laptop tomorrow too. XP has caused me nothing but nightmares."
2,THIS MACHINE DOES NOT WORK IN A SMALL NETWORK ENVIRONMENT!!!,"I just started a small business and thought this would be a perfect start up office equipment. Everything works great...I would have given it 5 stars, except for it's one BIG SHORTCOMING. This printer does not work in a simple network environment!!!"
3,Not exact replacement,"I ordered this product instead of universal pumps because it claimed it was an exact fit for my 2003 Hyundai Sonata. However, the o-ring with the screen that fits inside the washer bottle is not an exact fit. It is too loose so the pump moves around when installed and fluid leaks out of the bottom. I ended up using the original o-ring that came with the car and the pump fit better. You can't use a screen though. Nine times out of ten nothing should get in the pump and clog it if you are pouring fresh fluid, but you never know."
4,Tasty Treats,"My father-in-law's lady friend has given us a box of either this fruit mix or the aplets&cotlets every Christmas for the past 5 years or so. I wouldn't say they're an extraordinary candy, but they are tasty little treats, kind-of like a giant jelly-bean with nuts in it. I think the pineapple and peach flavors are best - very sweet with strong flavor. They have LOTS of sugar, though...I think my hubby read that 3 pieces of the candy carry 29 grams of sugar."
5,Fruit Delights Still a great product!,We have purchased fruit delights for the last three years and they are still consistently great. Would recommend them to anyone. We will be ordering more. Fruit Delights are great!
5,good food - lousy deliver,"The food I ordered was tasty and enjoyed by everyone, but it took three weeks to get the order. Somehow it got stuck in Des Moines, and was not delivered 40 miles to the west until I complained that the delivery had not taken place. Then they hired a courier to bring it to me. Too late for Christmas giving, however. But the candy was very good. I ate it myself."
5,Guide to solving any computer glitch,I found this book excellent for the novice computer geek. The book explains the possible senarios and then tells you various ways to fix it.The book covers everything from Monitors to Hard Drives and is multi platform. (PC and MAC)
1,Geek Squad Stole my Hard Drive,"Okay, how can this book be useful when, if you take your computer to the Geek Squad, they're likely to break it? I took them a working laptop, with a couple minor things that needed to be fixed. Now, they've taken my hard-drive, and won't give it back. I keep calling everyone involved, but am seriously considering a criminal complaint."
2,Waste of money,"This book will not help you if you really have a serious computer problem, chances are, the author will suggest you better take your computer to a technician. Why then did i buy the book? The so called solutions are summaries on how to fix problems as the author tries to cover three major applications problems under 218 pages. I suggest he writes three separate books for each application,(Mac, windows 3.X and widows 95/98). This book might be good for someone who wants to learn tips on maintenance or how to prevent computer problems. I had to buy another book that helped me with my problem."
1,Maybe the Geek Squad should read this book,"In my dealings with the Geek Squad, I've found them quite incompetent. I won't go into the my main story because it's so darn long. But, they're awful. If you need to take your PC somewhere, please take it anywhere BUT to the Geek Squad.About the book. The book is full of very basic, but useful information for the novice computer user. Honestly, I think you'd be better off with a PC Repair for Dummies book or something.If you think about it. Would the Geek Squad rather you buy the book ($15), or bring your PC to them (min. $120, but probably more)? They'd probably prefer BOTH. However, they don't want to provide enough info in the book to keep you from visiting them and giving them more money.To sum it up. The book is okay, very basic, but I think you'd be better off with a ""For Dummies"" book."
2,Out of the 224 pages maybe a total of 5 are worth reading.,"This book is very vague. If you know anything about computers it is a complete waste of money. I read the whole book and found, at most, five pages of quality reading. They have a funny name, but geeks should keep to fixing computers not writing books."
1,Dont buy in hopes of fixing your computer.,"Anyone that needs to buy this book to understand problems with their computer have NO business working on one either.Definitely don't have geek squad fix it either, unless you want your private files violated."
1,I want my money back!,I find that I waste my money on this book. Too simple for real problems. Is this just a silly way of finding something to do besides fix easy computer problems for nieve users? This is not what I bought this book for. I would like my money back!
3,The Tantrum That Almost Changed the World,"Fun and colorful illustrations, flowing and fun rhyming text, and a storyline that will no doubt give cause for discussion. The little girl Melanie Jane throws a tantrum like no other when her mother is unable to paint the sky red. The parents try to bribe her, coddle her, and plead with her to stop her tantrum. Although I know the storyline is exaggerated and over-the-top, I was still a little concerned my daughter might think bribing and letting a child's tantrum rule the parents is acceptable and normal. But as it's all in fun, as well as being fun to read, I recommend it with only minor reservations."
4,Good Book about true story!,This was a thrilling and frustrating book to read. Sometimes you want to jump into the pages and smack around some of the characters. I got very involved in the reading and really enjoyed. Finished it in a day.The author isn't the best reader and the first couple chapters are hard to get through because he jumps around BUT I always enjoy reading about true stories. Worth reading!
3,Not a bad workout,"The video is properly titled as a stretching video. The focus is on the legs, buttocks, and hips. There are 3 women on the video each with a strong chair that certainly must be be glued to the floor because they don't budge. One will need a strong support to complete the exercises in the video whether it is a stable chair or something else. The exercises are reasonable and challenging and the exercise leader is quick to tell the participant to modify the exercise or do only as many as she can. The music is light and in the background which is good. The only thing that bothered me was the women really have an eighties look to them in their dress and in their hairstyles but, I suppose that shouldn't detract from the exercises."
1,WW tone and stretch,i thought that it was a dvd...i don't have a vhs recorder. I didn't want to have to send it back and pay for s&h
2,"Good for practice, but not the best","I used this book for my physics class, and I thought it contained good problems for practice. It was very understandable, but i would not use it as a study guide. It definately lacks the explanation a first time physics student would need, especially since physics IS very confusing. use this book with other, more explanatory books."
1,Completely incomplete!,This books provides skimpy coverage of the chemistry you'll need for the MCAT. There are very few practice problems and they do not reflect the MCAT format. Don't bother.
2,Good refresher but...,"This book does a good job of refreshing existing knowledge though it can get skimpy on explanations. The biggest problem though is that it is riddled with typos and that you have to be careful to pick them out otherwise things get confusing. To the editor: please do your job and make sure that the numbers are correct, it is very difficult to learn/refresh when there are things that don't make sense."
3,Use with other books,This is a good refresher book for those that haven't had chemistry in a while. However I would recommend using it in conjunction with either Examcrackers or Kaplan as well as a chemistry textbook for reference.
4,An Adequate Refresher!,the MCAT Chemistry touched the essential key concepts in chemistry for the MCAt. It functioned as a good refresher for me.
4,Pecan Halves,"A good buy. Nuts are fresh and tasty. Not all are halves, quite a few broken pieces and even some cracked shells, but overall satisfactory. I will order them again."
5,This book answers lots of questions. . .,This book meant a lot to me since there is dementia in the family. After reading it I understood the disease and how doctors now try to prevent it. It empowered me to help myself. I now know mentally and emotionally and physically what to do to prevent dementia.
3,"Beautiful pictures, abysmal text","I could not agree more with the review by ""Reader from Spain"". I buy a LOT of costume/fashion books and hardly ever review them, but felt moved to do so for this book because the text is so dreadful. The photographs are stunning, as are the garments pictured, but the words are really quite atrocious (to steal a line from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!). The text is utterly pretentious and so badly written that I (an editor) checked several times to see whether it had been translated from a language other than English - it is that stilted. Obviously a book like this is bought mostly for the pictures, but the text is so disappointing."
4,Haute Couture... as the title implies,"This collection from the Met is lovely. Although I agree that the text could be more laudable; I think the book ,overall, is a gem. The photos are lovely and there are close-ups of several techniques. Definitely a worthwhile book."
4,Great for Short Hair,"I have used a few ""Flat Irons"" and this one seems to work well. I have not had any problems. This is a ""hard to find size, and the price was great!"
5,"Classic blocks, made in New England","I was thrilled to find these blocks on Amazon. I had played with a similar set as a child, in our church nursery. Those blocks were played with constantly for about 40 years, and the older this type of block gets, the better.They're beautifully shaped and sanded smooth, with no sharp corners. I can't wait 'til Christmas morning, so I can play with my niece and her new blocks.They are more expensive than other block sets, but I know my niece and any siblings or cousins (or even children and grandchildren!) she may have someday will get just as much joy from them as she will. And the fact that they're made locally of real maple, cutting down on the amount of fossil fuels used in shipping and are made without any hazardous finishes or undesirable factory conditions makes me feel better about giving them as a gift."
1,Very Tiny T-shirt,Quality is very thin I ordered an XL even though I really wear a Medium this t-shirt is so Tiny it is probably more like a childs Small thank an adult XL
2,Watch what size you order!,"While the quality is nice enough, this shirt runs WAAAAAY small. I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large thinking that would give me plenty of room. WRONG! I feel like a sausage stuffed into it. I think an XXL might still be snug. Also, I guess is intended to be worn as ""underwear"" as it's see through. Too much trouble to send it back, but really wish I had passed."
2,Not the best fit,"This T-shirt is just so-so. The fabric is fine, but nothing special. It is cut very close to the body, which is fine, but I think the sleeves are an unflattering length. My biggest complaint is the overall length, however; these shirts are very, very short. Although the shirt fits me pretty well everywhere else, it barely comes down to my navel."
1,Great Shirt - Poor Sizing,I wear a fairly standard Medium Women's T-Shirt. Since this is a designer shirt and cotton I went up a full size and purchased a large. The large is comparable to a small - so unless you're willing to go up two sizes I wouldn't recommend this shirt.
3,Fit wasn't very accurate,"This was a great buy at under $10, but the XL fit more like a normal women's size Small. I bought it for my mom, but ended up keeping it myself since it's more my size than hers. I thought the material could have been thicker too, but you can basically see through this form fitting T shirt."
3,Decent shirt for the price,"After reading the reviews of this shirt, I bought an XL even though I normally wear a medium. The XL fits well except that it is too shirt. I realize this is more of an undershirt or a shirt to sleep in though.The materal is about average for a cotton shirt. It's not very soft.Another thing I don't like about this shirt is that the tag is on the outside of the shirt. There is a little ""versace"" tag on the back of this shirt, near the neck. I don't like the look of this tag being on the outside of the shirt.Overall, this shirt is flattering to the torso. I am short and thin and feel like this shirt looks good on me.However, this shirt is worth no more than $10 (including shipping). If I had paid more for this shirt, I would have been very disappointed."
4,shapeshifter,"well this is an easy book to read, you don't get lost with a lot of hard sci-fi details. this book sort of reminded me of a Robert Heinlein book. one part lost me a bit when the character of the changeling first appearred, but that was minor. I liked the characters- Skallon and Scorpio[the talking dog]. over all i'd rate this a good fast read read."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Hard to stop someone when you don't know what they look look.A group is dedicated to stopping changeling hired killings, but it is an occupation that has a pretty high fatality rate. This is a fairly bleak book, as neither the hunter or the hunted are people that you really would want to have dinner with, in this situation. Fairly short, but not really worth the time, as such."
2,well...sorry,well this book has a cool idea. but you cant take pictures of auras or at least i dont think so. this book just talks about the camera he uses. i looked at the book at a book store and it was all just him making money. sorry to the author. but i wouldnt read it.
5,"Even though i play GTA, I like Klonoa","Pros- Fun, Addicting, Great Graphics, Somewhat Difficult,easy to pick up,Cons-Helium Enduced Voices make you mute your t.v and put in a CD, a little short(so you'll probally beat it in a day or two)Overall, better than those repetitive Spyro and Crash Bandicoot games. Like Harvest Moon, Klonoa is one of those rare titles that are more kid oriented, but even older people like me have trouble with them."
5,The ultamate platform!,"Klonoa is a classic platform game for the PSX. It is one of the best none english game for the PSX. The violence is tiny so get your kids ready for this action packed, very awsome platform game."
1,wrongly advertised at the expense of the consumer.,The right O2 sensor for a 2003 V70 is Bosch 13118 that I just ordered and hope that it would work.
2,"Lots of cuteness,but very little real information or depth","This is a series that is big on cuteness, but there is very, very little in the way of actual video or discussion of the cities being visited. Must each scene end with a big smile and a joke? If you monitor the actual time spent on showing you around each city, you will be very surprised. If you are looking for a light, shallow, cute show in which the host is the center of interest instead of the incredible places she visits, then this is for you. Very disappointing! Even the Rick Steves shows are very superior to this series."
2,Perky,"This is a travelogue for the sort of people who ""do"" Europe, who skip through Rome or Paris in a day or two, see the highlights, and tell their friends back home about the shopping and the restaurants where they ate. Quaint is the operative word with them. The DVD is a shallow series of visits to a very few places in France and Italy.As for the tour guide, Samantha Brown, she is attractive and perky, but she seems more interested in hotel rooms and views therefrom than in historic places, art, etc."
2,"Good itinerary but not in depth, badly edited, & not funny!","On this DVD, Samantha Brown offers a great itinerary of the French & Italian Riviera which she visits during the winter but is not nearly as in depth as Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa! Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions. For a more thorough series watch ""Best of Europe by Rudy Maxa"" or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009""."
3,Fun but not very informative,"I have shown this DVD to my French class students. We all have enjoyed Samantha's sense of humor, naivety and honesty about her unsufficient knowledge of French. So this DVD is OK if you want to have a quick look around Paris but I certainly would not use it for planning my next trip. It's only an appetizer!"
5,Samantha Brown's Passport to Europe,"Beautiful scenery and a gracious host. Or should that be beautiful host and gracious scenery. Oh, I know! Beautiful scenery, beautiful and gracious host."
5,Passport to Europe-France & Italy,"Passport to Europe - France & Italy-- We are getting older and like to do some armchair travelling. We have lived in Rome, Italy in younger years and were delighted with the travel DVD for Italy. It was as if we were right there to visit the Coliseum again. The street scenes were delightful and pulsing with life.My wife had never been in France while I have visited Paris several times . The Paris show was most interesting and exiting as my personal visits were. The Passport visits four places in each country and the scenes from Nice and Monte Carlo were outstandingly beautiful. If you can't go to visit in person, it is a bargain to look at these DVD's and if you plan to visit these countries, prepare by viewing these DVD's afore hand for ideas."
2,this book isn't for Mac users,"This book looks absolutely perfect, when I opened it I was convinced that all my questions about photoshop 4 would be answered....however, I was not aware when I bought the book that it only refers to applications for windows users. Needless to say I was disappointed, extremely frustrated and back to square one!"
3,Needs improvement,"I'm only about a third of the way through this book. Two flaws stand out:1. Supposedly, you can download the photos used in the book exercises from the Internet. The link given in the front of the book does not work, and there are no photos anywhere on the website for download. Unlike many Photoshop instruction manuals, this one does not come with a CD.2. The gray scale card that comes with the book as an attachment in the back has a strong reddish cast, making it useless for adjusting color balance.There is some good information here, but the author goes overboard on trying to be funny. The constant jokes wear thin in a hurry.On the positive side, this book leaves out a lot of the basic stuff, making it a fairly good read for someone who already has Photoshop Elements experience. It is not a good book for beginners."
1,Mac Users Avoid This Book,"Not until I purchased this book did I find that this book does NOT cover Elements 4 for the MAC. There is discussion in the front of the book that the MAC edition of Elements 4 was available before publication of the book, but they went ahead with this publication anyway. Nowhere did I find any mention of this fact prior to my purchase."
3,Great Show - Terrible Packaging,"The packaging is as someone put it criminal!They have stacked 3 disks on a single spindle one on top of the other.This will promote scratching on the disks - for thoes who like to keep their discs in mint cond. or collectable, this is not good.It also makes it difficult as to get to the third disc you have to remove the first two. Cheap and inconsiderate design.The show is great - I find the Video quality transfer bettter than the previous 2 seasons. Although the humor I find has changed slightly in the 3rd season, also the Character Chano is no longer on the show which might have changed the balance?If not for the case I would have given a 5 star."
1,Excellent show POOR package,"One of the finest sitcoms of the 70's & early 80's. The show gets five stars hands down. My copy of season three shipped in the poorest packing job the dvd box set Gods ever thought up. It is a spindle with the discs stacked on top of each other. How cheap can you get. This set is a must for Barney Miller fans, but I have already ordered a new case to put the discs in."
1,Criminal packaging,"5 stars, of course, for the series, but at least a -5 stars for the packaging. As others have already stated, all 3 discs are stacked on 1 spindle. This is a capital crime, Sony. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of shoddy workmanship. If you wanna keep releasing 'em like this, then I'm done with buying 'em."
4,Great show...bad packaging!,"Great show, very good transfer and I can't wait to get the remaining seasons when (and if) they are released.Sadly it misses a star for the bad packaging and presentation. Instead of individual mounts or cases for the discs, we get all three in one case and on one mount. So to get to the last disc you have to take the first two out...this is horrible and increases the chances of the discs getting damaged. Also, there is no booklet listing the episodes or their titles. Very poor!If a job's worth doing...do it right. Next time, I hope the manufacturers will go back to the designs for either the first or second seasons, those were much better."
4,Barney Miller Season 1,I enjoyed this season of Barney Miller all over again. But heaven help a police force consisting of such as comprise this series! Gwennie
5,Great show,"I love the Barney Miller show. I have three season and I can't wait until the 4th season is released. It has very good humor, funny characters and not a single use of foul language. I wished our policemen would take lesson from Barney and his detectives"
5,Best of the 70s,"Barney Miller was the funniest and most humane sitcom of its day, and it has lost nothing over the decades. It has gained greatly in the dvd version by not being interrupted by commercials."
1,Packaging Issue,"Anyone, have they changed the packaging on this, yet? I'd like to buy it but I've seen those ""spindle"" cases before. TERRIBLE!"
3,"Wonderful TV, lousy packaging","Barney Miller is one of the best TV shows ever.But whoever decided to package this with 3 DVDs inconvienently stacked onto each other, was a moron."
4,Better writing than today's TV,"If you appreciate writing instead of gore, you'll love Barney Miller. The characters are funny, the situations are funny, and there's more than a little wisdom in this view of an NYC precinct. I suspect that there is more truth in this protrayal of every day cops than in all the flashy modern series. This is humanity writ large."
1,Plain old greed,Like Forrest Gump said:Stupid is as stupid does! To pay more than $10 for this book is stupid! It's a paperback and doesn't even have Joe Walshs best songs! Greedy sellers should be banned from Amazon!
2,I just threw this book away last week,"I own this book is definitely not worth 400 bucks, or 100 used. I personally don't feel it's as accurate as stated in other reviews. I pitched this book in the trash while going through stuff I haven't touched in a year or two. It's not that great."
2,A Daydream of Dictatorship,"This book is the author's fantasy of what he'd do if he were made dictator of the USA. Of course, whatever he wants is obviously right and whoever disagrees with him is obviously stupid or ill-intentioned. The author's approving attitude toward General Jarulzelski, military dicatory of Poland, gives a clue toward his attitudes. I give the book two stars instead of one because of the entertainment value of reading one man's elaborate book-length power fantasy."
3,Allies chased by the ghosts they helped create,"During WWII Allies where angered with Argentine neutrality in the conflict. They tried to steer Argentine governments away from their position by talking about an attack by Germans to Argentina (from outside and/or inside the country). This book shows that while it's true that there existed a large organized German (even Nazi) community within Argentine borders, their biggest trophy was keeping Argentina neutral, not converting it into an Axis country. It tells how a counterintelligence manouver can get those that created it to believe their own lies. The style of the book is sometimes boring (maybe because it is filled with so much information, names, etc.)."
2,Save your money!,"This light is just NOT bright enough. I have a small-ish car (Hyundai Accent) and it doesn't light up enough for me to see anything but his feet which are closest to the mirror. If I would have known, I'd have bought the cheaper plain one or one with animals on it to entertain my son..."
1,Don't Bother,"I like the idea of the mirror & it functions well in that respect. The size is good: it doesn't take up too much space, but if it's the light you're drawn to, don't bother. I've seen more output from a keychain light. It's useless at night."
1,forget the light,"We bought this thinking the light would illuminate the baby but it didn't. The mirror was o'kay until we bought another mirror with lights, music and a remote. Now we realize how small the mirror is and our baby loves looking at herself in the new larger mirror.I would not recommend this item and recommend spending $5 more for the larger mirror with all the extras."
1,Light has no purpose,"This mirror works very well in the daytime, but as soon as the sun goes down, forget being able to see your baby! My husband and I have agreed that the light on this mirror is useless. I gave this mirror one star because the whole reason we purchased it was for the light option. We will definitely be returning this mirror for a better one!"
2,Don't waste your money,"Light is not bright enough, gets turned off easily, mirror is too small to really see. I suspect it will work better with a toddler than an infant."
2,Good Idea - Bad Manufacturing,"The mirror is great in the daytime - but like the others said, the light is useless. The whole reason I bought this one is for the light. Save your money - dont get this product."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!,So I think the batteries for the remote control cost more than the mirror itself. I think the mirror needed batteries too. The light worked for less than a month and then we needed to buy more batteries. The light turns on via the remote and automatically turns off - early. We had a hard time deciding whether we should buy the one with the light or a bigger mirror. We chose this and fully regret it because the light is weak and it is extremely cost INEFFECTIVE. We do not recommend this product.
2,Doesn't last long,"I bought this for the light, but have never been able to really see my son with the light on. I usually just use the light from my mobile phone. Also, I used this light 2-3 times and the thing just stopped working. I haven't checked to see if it is the battery in the remote or the bulb just burnt out. Either way it was pretty much a waste of money."
1,Contains aluminum,"Be aware that this contains aluminum which is associated with Alzheimer's. While the amount of aluminum in one pill may not be alarming, if you take several of these pills daily, it adds up, and the cumulative effect can be of concern. If you've some time to spend, you can research the association of aluminum with cognitive impairment yourself using Google Scholar - I have."
5,Great Packaging and Great Package of Songs,"Finally, a worthy collection of graphics, writing, and music that places this band where they deserve to be - one of the most influencial and ambitious bands of the last 25 years. The CDs sound great, and the packaging by noted designer Stephan Sagemeister is as provocative and uncompromising as the band. Great essays, great photos. For someone who discovered this band in '77, this package was a steal at $50 ... worth every penny."
1,Skip the compilation and go to the source,"The compilations are o.k. but with the catalog still available go straight to the source. Start with ""More Songs about Buildings and Food"" and ""Remain in Light"" Once you're hooked, add ""Fear of Music"" and ""77"" to your collection. Need more? Then get ""Little Creatures"" and ""Speaking in Tongues"" Finally, dig up as much live performances as you can. That's where they were a revelation. The ""Stop Making Sense"" DVD is great. It's scandalous that ""Name of this Band is Talking Heads"" is out of print."
2,originals better - very overmixed and not as smart,"I'll keep this short.Packaging surely clever ,attractive & collectable.But *for music*, originals are sooo much better. these remasters/remixes are not as smart as the originals, and heavy handed, and not as elegantly simple raw & pure.. sort of .. clever & corporatevery very very disappointing"
4,"Say something once, why say it again?","I'm not really sure what the point of this collection is, especially since SAND IN THE VASELINE covers the same and a bit more ground, and the more important double live CD THE NAME OF THE BAND IS TALKING HEADS remains unreleased.Regardless, there are music videos included here. Yawn. and there is a bit of remastering, which sparkles everything up a notch. Why else you might want to pick this up, I couldn't really say. If you liked the Heads, this adds nothing but the MTV side of the story to your collection. If you don't like them, this won't convince you. If you're curious, yeah, why not, I suppose. But having done SAND, what's the point?oh, I forgot: money, especially when your solo careers have laid eggs. rotten sulfurous eggs..."
5,Essential Talking Heads,"3 discs of music and with videos spanning the career of one of my favorite bands ever. This features selections from all of their albums, concentrating on the first four records. It also featues a few live and alternate tracks. I obtained this when it was released in late 2003 to upgrade from 1992's Sand in the Vaseline 2 CD set, but superfans currently should consider the recently released Brick boxed set. My only complaint lies with the highly disturbing artwork and awkward packaging."
1,"tedious, name dropping drivel","I found the book tedious, too full of name and label droppings. Every item was from some obscurely expensive store, or some reference to an author no ordinary person would know. I am gay, but find this kinda of gay writing to represent a very one sided gay life, full of bitchy, vacuous, demeaning comments. The most important part of the book seems to have been glossed over, the part where Matthew feels up his dad while he is asleep, and from this he feels somewhat responsible for his suicide. Lots of tired ""Woody Allenesque"" dialog and self reflection. It has all been done before, AND MUCH BETTER. Straight people might like it as it provides a cleaned up version of gay chat lines, but sounds like the musings of a pill popping, name dropping circuit queen trying to validate his lawyerly life of cash cash cash.And like the other reviewer said about the cover, I too find the cover art boring and trite. Yikes, and that author picture!"
5,Excellent Album,A bit pricey for an album but I think it was worth every penny. Very relaxing and enjoyable like all Lemongrass this one helps me relax and enjoy the moment.
4,The music good- supplier poor,The music is fine but I can not get two songs. I purchased a used one in like new condition and it is not.
3,cool band,"I don't own any other GVSB albums so I don't know if it's as good as their other cd's. I think that they have a cool & original sound. they're electronic with sounding techno-ish(which isn't always bad). my favorite song is roxy though they all rock.though all their songs are good I like the more melodic ones(roxy,psycho future,etc.)if your into electro-rock GVSB won't disapoint."
3,"Better than most, but not up to usual standards","A fine effort when compared to today's current crop of artists, but fails to match the stellar achievement of 1996's House of GVSB. Freak on Ica ignores much of the sultry groove that made House of GVSB and the band's earlier work so successful."
2,embarrassing sell-out record,"This is one major letdown from one of the most interesting ""indie"" bands of the nineties. Every one of their previous albums contain some essential indie rock up to this one. They were on a roll, the albums were getting more and more consistent, the buzz around them was getting huge, then they fall flat on their face. This is a classic example of a major label sell out. The music has lost all the attitude, edge and electricity. Its hard to even recognize Mr. McCloud's trademark vocal. These guys had to have been taking cues from the corporate people. Shame on you.This is a great band, but don't bother with this one! Sure, it's better than most.......on the radio, but why settle for this."
5,My favorite tarot book!,"I've read over 50 books on Tarot and I keep going back to this one. Like a great Tarot deck, every time I use this book, I discover a new insight. It is written clearly and laid out well for a beginner, but sophisticated and intelligent enough to continue to appeal to someone like me who has read everything else, too. While the authors are feminist, they are also very in tune with the non-political and the non-gender issues their readers are bringing. I guess if someone hates the idea of the potential power in women, or thinks violent patriarchy is the pinnacle of human development(!), they would be turned off by the authors'feminist approach. But most folks should find a lot to work with here!"
5,Great teacher's resource,Just bought my second copy of this book. I had misplaced my first copy and was panicked I wasn't going to be able to find it before we started studying body systems in my fifth grade classroom. The models are great. They really help the students understand the body systems. I highly recommend this book for all California fifth grade teachers.
2,The Body Book,"This definitely is geared for the upper end of the age group (3-6th grade). Lots of black & white pictures, not very interesting for the younger child. You must make copies of the cut-out pages or the book is destroyed. I've decided to hold it for a couple of years 'til my grandchild is around 10."
3,An OK book,I must admit I was disappointed when I received this book. Three stars is a very generous rating in my opinion. With the book I also ordered Human Body from Carson-Dellosa and it is MUCH BETTER. The body book is not a 3-6 level book as it seems more like a 2-4 book to me. I teach 5th grade and it seems to low for them.
3,Too Many Copies,"This book requires about 5 copies for each body system. It has great info for the upper grades 5-8, but who gets that many copies!"
1,bad batch?,"maybe just a bad batch but the ""heads"" all broke off on 75% of each bit on the fisrt attempt to drill. nothing bad about the material i was drilling; the bits i used from lowes all worked for 40-60 holes per bit in 4"" slab concrete (cured)."
4,Pretty Good Masonry Bit,"I'm using these to drill weep holes into the brick mortar on my home (for some reason, the contractors neglected to leave them when building the house). One bit lasted for 10 holes through the mortar (and a little bit of brick when I misjudged the spacing). Although, to be honest, I should have swapped bits after the 7th or 8th hole. Really slow going for the last few. I was using this bit with a Makita 1/2"" hammer drill, which performed flawlessly, as expected.Makita BHP454 18-Volt LXT 1/2-Inch Lithium-Ion Cordless Hammer Drill Kit"
5,Not jealous. Well ...maybe slightly.,"As an acquaintance of the author, I naturally harbored the faint hope that his first published novel would be horrid. However, I confess to having inhaled the whole book from cover to cover. Not Me is as funny and trenchant as Phillip Roth - if Roth could still write funny - with the added fillip of a whodunit element which, in my case, kept me up until 3AM. Note to S Spielberg: A great first movie role for Seinfeld."
5,A hard book to put down,"This book is a tapestry of different themes on identity, alongside the age-old question of ""when is one relieved of their sins?"" I really enjoyed this completely different approach to the subject matter of WWII and the Concentration Camps, and became so engrossed in the novel that I just couldn't put it down. I thoroughly recommend it."
2,I'm so disappointed!,"The story is interesting but I just can't get through the poor writing. I agree with the critic who described the metaphors as ""clunky"". I also agree that the most interesting part of the story is in the journals. I'm abandoning the book reluctantly. I wanted to like it, especially after all of the 5 star reviews...."
4,Not an avid reader but liked this book,"I am not an avid reader and rarely read fiction. I saw a review of this book in my local paper and ordered it. I read it in 2 days which is something of a miracle for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and being Jewish and having to deal with parents afflicted with Alzheimer's, I really ""got into"" the story. I think any who read it will like this book."
3,Interesting,"This book was my pick for book club. I enjoyed it, and the book club gave it a rating of 3.5 (out of 5) - mainly because they didn't find the main character to be very likable. I found the topic interesting, but felt like we really never got all the answers to questions that were asked in the book...who were all the people visiting his dad, who gave him the journals, where had they been all these years? However, the topic of the book did make for a lively discussion at our book club meeting - which is always a good sign."
3,A story I've heard before set to fiction,The writing is good and the story moves along. The larger introspective issues of a father and son's relationship and a failed marriage are only minimally addressed.
5,Inspired great conversation!,"I bought it in the bookstore at the Holocaust Museum and had completed it in just two days. It was easy to read, yet gripping and thought provoking. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to jump start their brain. This book inspired great conversation with my family and friends. Conversation about sin, forgiveness, regret, and redemption."
3,skips fishing,"This is an avarage dvd at best.It has some good info for first time fisherman but nothing for a seasoned angler. While it was worth watching it was not worth the money. Maybe $10.00 would be a better price as there are better fishing shows on TV for free, with more and better info."
3,before going to Montenegro,"This product is valuable for travellers who are preparing a holiday in Montenegro, but my feeling is that choosing hotels and restaurants took too much space. I also would have liked more photos and more on history"
2,Not the Lenmar 1120 mAh item,I received MaximalPower 800 mAh batteries instead of the Lenmar 1120 mAh batteries advertised. The seller was unable to replace them with the higher capacity product and so offered me a refund. I recommend calling the seller to verify product before ordering. They were very nice to talk with.
1,NOT Jerry's Finest Work,"I love Jerry Lewis flicks, but when I rented this one both myself and my husband were disappointed. This movie was not funny in the least. If anything, it's Twilight Zone-ish appeal made me feel like I should smoke a joint. Definitely trippy and weird, the movie's cover box makes the renter/buyer think they are getting a great slapstick hit. Not so. The movie had absolutely no plot, which I did find appealing and different, but Lewis' character as the Bell Boy was a mute until the very end of the film, relying solely on bodily actions. Of course, Lewis does do many of his famous faces throughout the film, but other than that, it was just a weird, weird movie. One I have no interest in renting again."
1,Just Plain Dumb,Jerry was not funny when he was with Dean. And this makes him any more funny being on his own.RIGHT
4,A Beginning,"This film occurred when Jerry Lewis needed a summer movie, Paramount wanted to release ""Cinderfella"", but Lewis insisted that wait for the Christmas season. Therefore, on a shoe-string budget he created his first masterpiece as actor, director, producer, and writer all on one film (with ""The Ladies' Man"", ""The Nutty Professor"", and other notables to follow). The film promises--from the beginning--to be about ""fun"", no more, no less. Indeed, it is pretty much a romp through sketches involving Stanley, a bellboy. Nevertheless, Lewis couldn't help added some social commentary, and the scene where he plays himself is among one of cinema's finest moments. Certainly not his best work--overall--but a great start to what is a lavish solo career."
5,Bellboy Review,"Just as hilarious as it was when I watched it growing up, and now on DVD. Simply excellent"
5,great retrospective,This is a great look at some of the best songs of ned's atomic dustbin. From the first album to the most recent. They were at the begining of that early'90's british movement. I think you will enjoy this Lbum.
4,Oldie but Goodie,"Dvd is good stuff its just from older material.Interesting and put together very well, good infobut its not anything new."
2,Common Sense over analyzed,"This book might be good for you if you are new to the sport of riding/racing sport bikes. And when I say new, I mean you really don't have a clue as to what you are doing on a sportbike.The dribble that went on and on in this book can be summed up by saying ""think about what you are doing"".The big text and ""kid"" like drawings don't lend much credibility to this book either. I feel like Keith Code struggled to get enough information together to call this a book."
5,Soft Science of Road Racing Motorcycles,"This book might not be for every rider. But the data on the different kinds of plans that one can make in relation to riding I think is excellent. Also, when you see the comments by Wayne Rainey (a hero of mine for sure), then you know this information applies at the top level of riding.Also, the section on one's sense of speed--I've been doing some racing and around racetracks for years, and there isn't anyone else that even talks about this (not in a fashion I can understand that is).The checklists that Code provides at the end of the chapters can really help pinpoint a riding problem. That is valuable to me.Again, not for everyone, but a little reading of this book, and a little patience with one's own riding can equal big gains. Well worth it."
5,Best analisys,Soft Science is one of the most analitical books in motorcycle riding. You bet your skills will improve a lot. We have a riding school and I put some ideas in discussion out there to see the results. It's awesome! I recomend it after more than 40 years of sportbikes ride.
3,Smaller then expected,"I was disappointed with the size of the pendant. I suppose I should have looked closer at the description. My wife does love it though and it's very beautiful, if small."
2,Do not buy it!,"Put it mildly, the difference between the picture and the real thing is day and night. The actual product is tiny, dull, and cheap looking. A total waste of money. Will never buy from them again. I gave it two stars because it's shipping was fast."
4,Nice but smaller than expected.,"Well made but smaller than expected. My teanage daughter liked it and it worked for her petite 5'2""size but it's not for a larger person."
1,Butterfly or Lady Bug,This is a beautiful butterfly....however....it's barely the size of ladybug! Again I've learned you must read every detail about a product before buying it because looks are definitely deceiving.
4,Small but pretty,"The picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears. I know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is. Nevertheless, my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me. The price was right at $18.00 so overall I think it was a good buy."
1,I think this maybe was intended for a little girl,I purchase this for my girlfriend but when I get the Butterfly Pendant I realize that it was too little. it appear to be design for a little girl not for an adult person definitely. I include some customer images because the image amazon provide wont give you a good idea of the size. In fact the color of that one and the one I got is totally different. Mine is pail and the one in the amazon photo is like a deep blue. The color is not that bad but the size kill it for me. Also the chain is really thin and flimsy. I can't give this to my girlfriend... total waste of money.
1,Way too small,This pendant is so small it's suitable for a child not an adult. I didn't expect it to be as big as the picture on amazon's site but the item turned out so much smaller I was really disappointed. It's a beautiful little butterfly. Heavy emphasis on little. Amazon needs to let people know how small it is so person can make an informed decision.
2,Saml and could you ship any worse?,"It is small! But that's OK my wife doesn't like big pendents. However it was sent just thrown in a velvet bag, which was in a box, in a larger box. It obviously had gotten thrown around so much that when I took it out of the bag to examine it, the chain was in 3 or 4 knots. I'm still working on getting then out without breaking the chain. Hopefully I can do it in time to give it as a gift."
5,Cute gift,"This makes a cute gift for a ten-year-old. The pictures give a clear idea of what to expect, and the recipient loved it."
2,very funny,"Upon arrival, in huge blue box and huge blue bag, when I saw the little tiny pendant, all I could do is crack up, I know the dimension but my gosh, how tiny it is...See if my friend like this for her Christmas present.I think it will look better if it comes in a small ring box, then it won't look so tiny."
1,amethyst pendant too small,This pendant is very tiny. I was very disappointed in the size. Would be good for a small child but not an adult.
3,Really Small,"I thought it would be bigger but when I opened it, it was really small. It is probably as big as my pinky nail"
3,Very Small!,"I originaly purchased this as a Christmas gift for my ten year old neice to match a pair of amethyst earrings I gave her the year before. I was very disappointed with the size - I didn't expect it to be large but this was tiny. I ended up giving it to my four year old neice who loves to wear my jewelery when she visits. It is the perfect size for her, if that tells you anything!"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed when I received the necklace because the Amethyst Butterfly was so very small. I mean really small!!
1,TINY butterfly,"This necklace butterfly is small, very small. I have bought butterflies at Kohl's for less but much prettied. I am to ashamed of this item to give as a gift."
1,butterfly pendant,"very disappointed- to send it back, but it states there is a restocking fee. Tiny little butterfly. Child size. Picture was very misleading.I would not recommend this."
2,Pretty but tiny,"I found this pendant to be very pretty...however the size was much smaller than I expected. I should have done the metric conversion carefully and not relied on the image provided. I think this is a great piece for a little girl, but not necessarily an adult."
1,lindasusanmanning,I'm extremely disappointed in its size. I should have read other reviews before making my purchase. Its cheap looking and very very small. Dont waste your money.
2,beautiful but very small,Got this for my wife on her birthday last year. It's a beautiful piece but it's VERY small. The picture is about a x4 magnification.
4,"good, but the pendant is smaller than it appear in the pic",the jewel is very beautiful and kilty but i forgor to see the dimensions.the pendant is very small. but is very beautiful.it's a good product. perfect for girls between 16 - 28
2,Should Have Read the Reviews,"Unfortunately I bought the thing before I read the reviews. It is lovely but oh so tiny. Also it irritates me to find that others bought it for $18 and I paid $25 - on sale. Oh well, live and learn. It is beautiful but a disappointing gift for an adult."
3,pretty but super tiny,"This is a pretty little necklace that comes in a black fake velvet bag in a gift box. It's cute but it's minuscule. I bought it for a 5yr. old. I'll give it to her because I bought a lot of other jewelry for her, but if I had seen it in the store I would never have purchased it because it's so tiny."
2,Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Pendant,"I was really disappointed in the size of the butterfly. It's really tiny. I had expected something a little bigger, since I purchased it for an adult. It's to be a Christmas for a family member who likes butterflies and amethyst is the birthstone. At least those 2 points matched. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not as big as portrayed.,"This necklace is ""cute"". Better for a young girl or petite woman. Very small, about the size of a pencil erasure on the end of a real pencil. Bought this for my 20 yo granddaughter because it is her birthstone. Will add a spark of dazzle, but just a spark. Shipping was fast, but I am not that impressed with the necklace."
2,REALLY small charm,The necklace looks like it's silver but in my opinion the charm mount looks fake. And the charm is TINY. I am so embarassed to give this as an xmas gift to an adult
3,Too small,item in picture looks bigger and once i got it and opened pacage i realized it was too small but still i like it and it will make a good gift.
2,Minature Butterfly for child,I got this as a gift for my adult sister. It is WAY too small for an adult. It is pretty but purchase for a young girl 10-14 only.
3,beautiful necklace but very dainty.,I love the Necklace as did my daughter but it was very weak and broke within a week. I would buy another one but put it on another chain.
2,Not satisfied,"This neckless is far smaller than it appeared. We had nothing to compare it to-- if we had known, we would not have bought it"
2,Picture deceiving and not for Adults more for a CHILD.,I bought this for my wife as a separate package deal with the matching earrings. But when they arrived the necklace was to SMALL as for a child. It will not look good on an adult IMHO. Sent back to Amazon and got full credit.Thanks Amazon dot com.
3,Misleading picture,"If you look at the picture of the item it looks much larger than it actually is. When it arrived, there was no way a grown woman could wear it, you could hardly see the butterfly. I ended up selling it to someone who had a little girl with a birthday in February. I lost money since I sold it for $10 and paid $17 plus shipping. The ad should at least have a notation such as: picture shown is 25 times larger than actual size."
2,Butterfly Pendant,"I was disapointed when this arrived, I expected it to be a little larger. The amethyst and butterfly pin was so small I had trouble telling it was a butterflySterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Pendant, 18"""
3,"Nice product, good quality but smaller then a dime. 1/2"" or less","From the web page this looked like 1"" inch butterfly. When I got it and opened it was only 1/4 to 1/2"" inch in diameter. I was a little disappointed by the size. I don't know if a adult womanwould wear something this small.Rick S.Mpls, MN"
3,Much more tiny than I expected,"The butterfly was so much smaller than I expected. I did not see the size until my niece took it out of the box. She acted pleased but I thought she may have been hiding what she really thought. I was very disappointed. My niece is 27 years old and the necklace was more the size for a small child, yet far to small to be safe for very small children.It would be great to have an idea of what size jewelry pieces are before you buy. Use some kind of size meter or on screen measuring method."
3,Smaller and lighter than shown,"It is very tiny, but it is nice. I purchased it with my daughter in mind. It could work for kids, but it seems very delicate. There is a stamp saying ""China"" on the back of the butterfly."
3,butterfly,Much smaller than I thought it would be. I had bought it for an adult but now will save it for a child.
2,too little,"I really don't like it. It is really small but the pic in amazon shows a nice butterfly. Photos should show a real size of each pendant. If i were known how small it is, i wouldn't buy it."
2,amethyst necklass,"Was dissapointed in this product. Very very small. I probably didnt read the discreption so well, but it is really small so read carefully if you want to actually see it while wearing it."
4,The recipient loved it... UNTIL...,"As many people have said, it is smaller then you might think, however, that was not the problem. My problem is that after wearing the chain for less then 3 days, it broke at the silver weld attaching the chain to the fastener. So in this case it will cost more to repair then to buy another one.Disappointed? Yes. Quality of the work and the look of the material is high."
1,So tiny....,"This product was worth about $5, if that, and was so small you needed a maganifying glass to see it - the chain was also very cheap. Amazon needs to take a look at their jewelry offers with a closer eye. I returned it."
2,Butterfly Pendant,It was much smaller than it looked like in the picture and the silver necklace seemed to be of poorer quality than expected.
3,Beautiful but Breakable,"I got this necklace for my girlfriend a year ago and she loved it! It looked great on her, but within a year of light wear, the stone fell out of the setting. If it hadn't broken, it would be 5 stars for sure! The chain is a little flimsy, but it held up fine given that the pendant is pretty lightweight. Also the pendant (the butterfly) has a relatively large loop if you'd prefer a thicker chain."
3,pendant,"it was beautiful, but it smaller than what i thought, could have been a little bit bigger in my opinnion"
3,Bring your magnifying glass,Nice pendant but a bit smaller than expected. Better gift for child than adult.
5,love it,"I got this as a gift, it is my birthstone and lovely. I love it, it;s dainty an pretty an great price. Love this!!"
3,pretty but tiny,"I'm going to say the butterfly is pretty. The chain is thin overall and the butterfly is small in size. I'm an adult but i dont like big things. Its ""ok"" but do not buy for anyone overweight...maybe not even an overweight child."
3,Very Cute But Very Small Too!,I read a review that this was small and approx the size of a dime so I thought PERFECT for a 14 year old for Christmas. WRONG! It is much smaller than a dime but it is very cute and I'm happy with it and I'm sure my 14 yr old cousin will be as well!!!
2,Very Small,I just purchased these earrings and the matching necklace and was very disappointed. Both these items (earrings/necklace) are very very small and in my mine only appropriate for very young children because it is so very small. I will probably keep it because they are pretty but a lot smaller than they appear when you look at their pictures.
1,Much smaller than pictured,The picture magnifies this and gives you a false sense of the size. You can barely see the amethysts in the setting. Disappointing.
3,"It's pretty, but not as blue as it looks like in the picture","I bought this for a niece for Christmas. Although she loved it, the picture is very misleading, as the stone is much lighter in person."
2,Way too small and NO luster,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my niece. I was disappointed in the size and quality of the gems. There is no luster to this necklace. I'm still debating on whether I should give such a LOW quality necklace. I have bought other inexpensive necklaces before, but this one just looks CHEAP!"
3,All you can spect from $25.00 dollars jewelry,"I bought this item although I have read Many reviews advertising it was Small, but small isnt quite enough the word to describe it I rather said its tiny almost micro. It could be the right gift for a kid but is important that you realize the size of this item before!"
1,butterfly,"Sadly I was very dissapointed when I received the necklace--It was very, very tiny and not what I had hoped for."
2,Pendant,Too small. This would be alright for a child but not for an adult. Other than that it was very nice.
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this unit. The butterfly was microscopic in comparison to the item as pictured. I was giving it as aChristmas present for my daughter who loves butterflies and she will feel the butterfly does not show enough.
2,small,"I should have read the reviews, it is pretty but this will be given to my granddaughter now instead of my daughter"
2,Buyer beware very small,"I should have read reviews first, tiny little butterfly. Meant for a child or very petite woman. I have Returned it."
1,very tiny,"This is not what I was looking for it list the chain as being 18"" it does not fit around a adults neck at all. This chain is actually 14 and 1/2 not 18 as described The butterfly is smaller than expected. Its more a little girls necklace. Extremely tiny butterfly about the size of a finger nail a childs. I will give it to a 8 year old neice for christmas instead of the adult it was meant for."
4,"54"" poulan z-turn",great machine for straight line mowing---only problem i have --the control levers are very stiff actuating especially the left side--and you must go to exactly neutral when stopping otherwise the machine will creep.
5,IMPRESSIVE SPARK PLUG!,"I decided to replace these due to the mileage and the fact that I was also replacing the wires.When you have old spark plugs out, these is an opportunity to see how each cylinder is burning by the color and condition of the electrodes. I can't believe the electrodes were still visible, gotta love that Iridium!! The color of the plugs were normal, so since I had them out I replaced them.Great plugs!!"
2,mileage went down,"i put these in my park avenue, took a 1500 mile trip. where i used to get 30+mpg, this time i got 26+mpg. either the plugs suck or the gas does"
5,"Replace Every 100,000 miles","Just popped a new set of six of these in my Lesabre and it runs even smoother now. I had no issues with the performance or reliabilty of the car. It just hit 100,000 and I decided to change these as a preventive maintenance item. The first set worked well for 100k and nearly 10 years. I don't see why the second set won't do the same. Genuine parts still make a difference."
3,"Good bargain, but lacking in flavor & freshness","As others have mentioned this tea is a good bargain here - also the tea bag option is convenient.I did find this tea lacking in taste, could have been just the batch I received was stale. Found a loose leaf option from Twinings to have much better flavor. It does cost more, but you will also end up getting a lot more tea for your dollar.Overall, if you need the convenience of tea bags, stick with this one, if not, I recommend tryingTwinings Green Gunpowder Tea (Loose Tea)"
2,Bitter Aftertaste,"I purchased this Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend Decaf Tea at my local supermarket because it was on sale and I was looking for a decaf black tea. It's not good. The brew time on the package states anywhere from 2-5 minutes. If you brew it for 2-3 minutes, it has no taste. If you brew it anywhere from 3-5 minutes it at least has taste, but has a noticeable bitter aftertaste. Anyone out there looking for an inexpensive, tasty, non-bitter, decaffeinated Black Tea should considerPG Tips Tea - Decaf - 80 Teabags. Much better!Once gone, I won't purchase this Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend Decaf again."
5,Best green tea I've found so far,"Individually wrapped and tastes great! Really like the flavour of this one, not bitter like most green tea. This is the best green tea I've ever had (though I buy all mine from walmart)."
5,Great flavor & aroma,"I really loved this tea. Fills the room with a wonderful scent and has a great taste to boot! I can not find this locally, so being able to get this on Amazon is wonderful. Free shipping and it arrives in a few days, can hardly beat that."
5,"Bigelow makes great tea, and this one is VERY good!","I was reluctant to try any chai teas after my initial experience with weird & medicinal flavored spiced teas labeled ""chai."" This is really good. Some of the reviewers said the vanilla flavoring was weird or strong, I think it's just right. I love this tea and everyone that I've served it to has also enjoyed it. Half of the tea I buy ends up going home with someone else! It makes a lovely ""chai latte"" or just served as chai. We drink it sweetened and heavily laced with milk, and it takes a strong flavored tea or it would be lost in the milk/sugar combination. This tea makes the cut. I definitely highly recommend it!"
3,"I like it. 4 stars for price, 3 stars for quality.","The Herbal Tea bought online did not give the same strong Mint flavour I got from the ones I bought at a local store, It seemed like old stock. Online one is cheaper in price and quality, but I do not the rate the quality same as the one bought from local store in person."
2,It's just green tea,"These teas smell so great in the packet and when brewing... but it's just green tea when you taste it. The flavors are barely there. If you like smelling the flavors while you drink green tea, then this is the tea for you! It wasn't the tea for me."
3,Cinnamon Tea,"I enjoy Bigelow Teas and was looking for a stronger cinnamon influence. It is very good, hot or cold. I will use it all, but perhaps stir with a cinnamon stick for deeper flavor."
5,Heaven in a box,"Ecellent flavor full bags only need one per cup and i use a giant cup,Cant Start mt day going with out it."
3,"Strong and Hearty compared to other Jasmine green tea, it's ok","This is not a delicate tea like most jasmine green teas. I prefer it to the other jasmines that I've tried which have been many. I also like the fact that I don't have to play mother hen to this cup of tea and it still tastes good. It has a pleasing smell of jasmine but it's not overpowering like a perfume. I don't like my tea to taste or smell like a perfume. That being said, this still is not my favorite cup of green tea. I much prefer Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orchard and Salada green tea over this green tea."
5,Doesn't have a smoky taste,"Many (if not most) green teas have a smoky taste that I dislike. This tea doesn't. Another reviewer describes it as having a hay-like taste. I agree, that's what I like about it.BTW: I usually cold brew it overnight. That yields a lighter taste and extracts a lot less caffeine."
5,Favorite Tea,"This is one of my favorite oolong teas, but for some reason it is not available in grocery stores."
5,Best Green Tea!,"I love this particular brand of green tea. I would not recommend the organic, this particular one is the BEST. It does not have the strange almost gritty flavor that most green teas have and is smooth. I have had it in the summer as ice tea and drink it all winter as well. I drink green tea all during the day as I am not a soda or water drinker and knowing it's good for me makes it that much better. Amazon provides the best service in this purchase as I could purchase in bulk as I use about 4 to 6 tea bags a day."
5,The best tea,"I love this tea. It is caffeine free, naturally sweet, and very relaxing. The blend of mint and chamomile is perfect!"
5,BIGELOW Chinese Oolong,"I don't know if this is what's helping me lose weight, but I'd buy it again anyway because it tastes so good. Really full-bodied. I drink a cup hot each morning. I am supposed to be using decaf tea, so I mix 2 of these tea bags with 2 Luzianne gal. size decaf bags to make iced tea. Boy is it good! I will definitely be ordering again if I still can't find it locally."
5,I fix my wife a cup every morning,"My wife absolutely loves the decaf chai tea. She wanted it so bad, that I finally ordered a case of it online. I make her tea every morning and it always brings a smile."
4,Pretty good.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good tea. But for some reason (filter paper? goofy tea grit size?) I can't get good flow out of these bags."
5,bigelow tea,My very favorite hot tea. Have tryed many others and keep returning to this one. Best brand in my opinion.
5,One pf my favorites,Love Constant Comment. It's my everyday stand=by for tea. Since I drink a lot of tea the 40 count box is a real money saver.
4,Bigelow Earl Grey Tea,"This tea was a gift for a friend, so I can't give much feedback on the tea itself. He's still a good friend, if that says anything!"
4,Good tea,This is a good sampler of tea. I would not buy again in bulk all the same teas because they do get old after a while.
2,"Based on reviews, not as good as expected","I got this tea because Twinings Vanilla Black Tea was way too expensive. Comparatively, this tea is a step above swill. The same sweetness and flavor doesn't even compare. The smell is exactly the same, which made it even more disappointing when I drank it. It's really weak, much weaker than I had anticipated. Don't get me wrong; it is drinkable and I'll finish it - waste not, want not - but I would never buy it again."
5,Love this tea!,"I've been drinking this flavor for years and it is my favorite! Right up there with Bigelows Orange flavor, my other favorite. I usually buy Bigelow. English Teatime is another one of my top choices.This Raspberry flavor is practically impossible to get in stores! Glad Amazon has it!"
2,Tasteless,"I love chai and the price was right so I bought this thinking, ""how different could it be from the Celestial Seasonings spiced chai I bought recently?"" Big difference, this tea has no flavor."
5,Delicous,One of my favorite teas. This teas has a mild citrus flavor and aroma that is soothing and relaxing to me. One of the best flavors I have found in a tea.
1,Weak and inferior to other brands,"I prefered the Twinings Darjeeling over the Bigelow.The Bigelow seemed weaker and didn't taste as good.I used the correct amount of water, brewed the water to 192 F, let the bag sit for 5 minutes.This worked well for the Twinings, not so well for the Bigelow.I will try letting it sit for 30 seconds less, and try using 1 less ounce of water.Try before buying in quantity"
4,Wonderful tea! But Amazon's price is now higher than the local store,"This tea is wonderful, a good blend of vanilla and spices, and a good amount of tea as well.However, with Amazon's recent price hike, changing the subscribe and save discount to only 5% (was 15%), this tea is now cheaper at Wal-mart. I can buy a single box at Wal-mart for $2.34 (including the sales tax, list price only $2.18), and this six-box set at Amazon now costs $2.42 per box (without sales tax).The tea I would give a 5-star, but downrating to four because it can be bought elsewhere for less. Shame on Amazon! The bulk rate for six boxes should be competitively priced, at or below what it costs at local stores.Addendum: Amazon must really want to get out of the retail tea business. Now a few days later, after I even submitted the ""tell us about a lower price"" form, informing them of the lower price available elsewhere, Amazon instead RAISED the price of this tea even higher. Strange indeed."
3,Not as good as others I've had.,"I compared the reviews for all of the Earl Grey teas on Amazon, and the reviews said Bigelow (Decaf) was better than Twinings and Stash, so I purchased it. I also purchased Choice Organic (Decaf) at the same time.I compared the two, and it seems that Bigelow is weaker. I don't think I'll buy Bigelow again. Not very impressed with the strongness (or lack thereof). I could barely taste it even after steeping for a long time."
5,I Recommend,"If you like to have a variety of actual Decaf. teas (not herbals), but have to hunt up and down the grocery aisles just to find 1 or 2 (on a good day), this is a very convenient, economical way to go. Also, you don't have to scrummage through 6 or 7 boxes in your kitchen cabinet for a particular flavor each time. Each box contains 3 bags of 6 different flavors, all individually sealed. The rest of the 6 boxes in your order can be stored somewhere in the back of your cabinet and pulled out one after the other.Bigelow Decaffeinated Assorted Teas, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)Bigelow Decaffeinated Assorted Teas, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
3,Try with honey...,"If you try this tea without honey or stevia it might not taste that good. But what tea does? This tea is flavored with real fruit juice concentrate and is made mostly with apples, hibiscus, blackberry leaves, orange peel and licorice root. Now I can't really taste the licorice it is far too subtle. This is just slightly tart and has a lovely deep burgudy color. Not a tea I crave but something different. I'd try out one box before I bought a whole bunch.~The Rebecca Review"
5,I Love Lemon,It's exactly like it says. great lemon flavor. It makes a great iced tea. Would recommend highly to all considering a purchase.
2,Stale Flavor,"I was unable that I ordered this product. The flavor is very weak in some of the tea bags, non-existant in other tea bags, and stale in other tea bags. Save your money and pay a little more for a different brand."
4,It's a winner,"Whenever I can find ""decaffeinated"", ""organic"", and ""green"" all in one tea, I have won the lottery; and to be able to buy a case of it means I don't have to constantly search for it in my local stores. This product has the tea bags packaged in groups of 4 bags per sealed pouch. That is perfect for me because I use the green tea to brew a pitcher of iced tea. It tastes best when I brew it for 3 minutes which is less than the instructions. Green tea can taste bitter if it is brewed too long."
2,weak,"This green tea, like a lot of them is very weak. It has been very difficult for me to find a good green tea at a decent price. Tzao makes a decent green tea but their price is a lot higher than others. One thing you can look at is how many ounces of dry tea they put in each tea bag. If they only have 2.19 ounces of tea per 40 tea bags, you know you're looking at some weak tea."
5,Chai Yummyness!,"I had tried Chai at a shop somewhere and really liked it so when I went shopping I found this brand and decided to try it. I LOVE IT!It isn't as 'easy' to make as regular tea. You have to boil the milk, water, and tea bags together. I serve it with some honey or sugar. It is great any time of year, I'll drink it hot in the summer.I have yet to try the cold version of it, but I want to. Perhaps when the spring comes around.I have not tried any other kind of Chai Tea so I do not have anything to compair it to, however, it is good enough to drink often. I actually drink this more than regular herb tea. I will make this more often than coffee. Very good."
5,Tasty blend,"Add some milk and sweetener and this is a very enjoyable tea. It has a unique taste -- the vanilla and spice balance each other, so don't expect a highly spiced chai."
5,Bigelow Darjeeling Tea,"Ordering is simple, service is great! It's good to know that my favorite tea is just a click away! Tea drinking at it's finest!"
4,It is that time of year again...,"Don't you just love when the nights turn a little colder in the fall. I enjoy getting into bed with a good book or my Kindle and a nice cup of spicy tea. This is a very mild tea with just a hint of spice and orange. It is not overpowering and is caffeine free. This tea contains rose hips, spices (tastes like cinnamon and cloves), hibiscus, orange peel, roasted chicory and natural orange flavors. Sip and enjoy.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Why are 4 bags in each packet?,We like the product but wonder why 4 tea-bags are in each packet instead of each bag wrapped individually?It's kind of a pain in the a*.
2,A little on the weak side,"Have to use 2 tea bags to get the Green tea effect. I've used other Green Tea products where I only need one tea bag. If you're not into Green tea but feel you should be using it, I'll recommend trying this brand."
5,Tastiest Decaf Tea,"Constant Comment by Bigelow is our favorite tea, and is no longer available in local markets in the decaffeinated version. We were thankful when we found it available on line, as we need to avoid caffein for medical reasons.Bigelow Decaffeinated Constant Comment Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
4,decaf tea,"I have tried all brands of decaffeinated tea, very few taste as flavorful and strong as regular tea.But Bigelow English Teatime decaf comes very close with strong tea flavor, it is almost as satisfying as regular tea (of which I have tried many, many brands.) I am a tea-aholic."
5,Love This Tea,"This is great tasting tea. Hopefully Amazon will keep carrying it, as I have not found it in stores. If you try this one, I'm sure you will love it too!"
3,Average taste,"I bought this tea because it is both organic and decaf. The taste is ok, but not great. I agree with some of the other reviews in that to get a decent cup of tea you need to use 2 teabags."
4,Nicely flavored decaf organic tea,"There is a lack of great tasting decaf organic teas on the market, and Bigelow is attempting to remedy this situation with products like lovely tea. Now if they would only do a decaf earl grey."
1,Ech... not so great,"If you really love the grassy, slightly bitter flavor of green tea, then you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for a tea that makes it easy and more enjoyable to get the health benefits of green tea but with a yummy blueberry flavor, this is not for you. The blueberry flavor is extremely subtle and easily overpowered by green tea flavor. The berry aroma is potent upon first opening the bag, but the flavor just doesn't deliver. I'm really disappointed."
5,Bigelow Chai,"I liked this tea best when made with milk and sweetened with honey. My Keurig coffee maker stopped working, and I was using K cup Chai, which was more expensive. The Bigelow Chai made a nice substitute."
4,Excellent!,"Now that I've discovered it, I will sample a few more varieties to be sure, but I'll probably come back & do the subscribe & save. Good stuff!"
4,Good tea,Excellent value. Much less cost than in stores if you like Biegelow tea you will like this tea. It is the same product for much less cost
2,"Basic, low quality Green Tea.","My headline pretty much sums it all up. This Bigalow Green Tea is your basic run of the mill, cheap, low quality bagged Green Tea. It hardly even tastes like actual Green Tea, it's been so refined. This stuff is definitely ""Bottom of the barrel"". However, it's cheap, and it's better than drinking soda or something, so if this contributes to your lifestyle change, GREAT!I recommend looking into a higher quality Green Tea though. Organic, and possibly a Matcha variety."
3,Needs some bite,"This is an ok tea, just not great. The raspberry flavor is mellow to the point of being flat. Most soft drinks contain citric acid for a reason. Real fruit has a tartness, which is what this rasberry flavor is lacking. I'm actually drinking a cup right now (just took a sip) and like I said, it's.... I don't know...flat. Where's the raspberry tang?"
5,Astounding,"The aroma is just incredible, the flavor is great also. I'm using it to make iced tea, but I'm sure it's good hot also. Everyone who has tasted it really loves it."
1,worthless,"Do not waste your money on this stuff. I wanted Jasmine tea, with bold flavor. I got the opposite. Yamamotoyama jasmine tea is the one I am sticking to."
3,Excellent tea but should be more obvious that black tea (caffeine) is included!,I have no complaints about the quality of this tea it is very good. My only complaint is that I do think it iscompletely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.I am always on the look out for something tea-like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas/coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine-free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.
2,Bigelow Green Tea with Jasmine 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6),"Its taste is not good to compare with the green tea. ""Jasmine"" smell is weird, not the real jasmine (?) when I & my family members had drunk this Jasmine tea, our blood pressures were increased and we have to stop using it (?)"
5,Best Earl Grey,"I like this blend better than other brands. Earl Grey is one of my favorites. Try it, you won't regret it."
4,Almost,"Good tea, but still not the same as Chinese restaurant flavor I was hoping for. Guess that's the elusive quality."
5,Excellent Tea,This is the first Oolong tea that I have tasted. I found it enjoyable with a mild and delicious flavor.
2,No taste. Not worth it! Buy in bulk.,"I never knew what real, good green tea tasted like until I bought loose leaf Gunpowder Green in bulk at a Middle Eastern market. Pre-bagged green tea is awful, tastes like dirty water, and does green tea no justice. This stuff is no exception. I like Bigelow for black teas and their flavored teas, but this is just bad green tea. The mint flavor just makes it worse. Please do yourself a favor and buy some bulk green tea--I recommend Davidson's Organic Gunpowder Green, which is $12 a pound (a bargain!!!). I buy it off Amazon, and it's an even better deal than I can get at my local market."
1,Nightmare,"I love to read reviews but seldom write one. But this product really leaves me no choice. Well, I tend to stay away from the notorious GV products which are widely present in Walmart. But I still buy their green tea product from time to time because it is cheaper than other major brands like Lipton. As expected, the taste is so-so. But, well, acceptable (reluctantly). You know what, after drinking this Bigelow thing, I start to like the GV green tea. Enough said. One more thing, if anyone can tell me what the hell is that smell from the packaging. I really appreciate it."
3,Suzanne,"Leonard Cohen fans take note this is the very tea that inspired the line in SUZANNE, ""and she brings you tea and oranges that come all the way from China."""
1,horrible hateful tea,"Oh My God!I bought this tea as I've read many good reviws, but when I recieved it I was very dissapointed...It was the worst tea what I've ever drunk..."
1,Did not work for me,"Did not work as a diet tea.I expected it to work like 3 ballerina tea it didn't.I,ll never buy it again."
1,Inappropriate for office use,"The tea is great and heavily used in our office, but there is no indication on the packaging that there are 4 teabags packed in 1 envelope. I'm giving it 1 star because 3 other people will be handling the bags."
4,Good value,"Don't expect ""authentic"" Japanese tea, but this is good. I feel the taste is a bit weak, but I use two tea bags and then it's fine. Great value for money."
5,Amazing Flavor,Bigelow Organic Green Tea has amazing flavor and provides natural energy for a busy day!
5,Great buy,"I drink this tea alot in cooler weather, which doesn't happen that often in Central Texas! I was down to my last tea bag and couldn't find the product anywhere...except at Amazon of course! Great buy."
4,Bigelow Vanilla Cai Tea,"I was introduced to this tea at a business convention at a Marriott about 3 years ago. Loved it, but couldn't find it our local grocery store or Wal-mart. Found it on Amazon at a good price and have been ordering it every since. I drink it every morning w/a little sweetner and/or flavored coffee creamer. Tastes just like what you get at the pricey coffee shops."
1,Exotic?,"If you think mud is an exotic flavor, then this is the tea for you. Otherwise, you might want to think twice. This tea smelled wonderful while brewing, but in the cup the taste is muted and muddled. There is some kind of spice there--I know because 1) it says so on the package and 2) I can feel the bite of something on my tongue, but I can't place what the spice is and it's aroma is barely discernible during drinking. It's like a mouthful of flat, flavorless... I don't know what. It was unbearable without sugar, and it didn't improve with it. I didn't add milk because I didn't want to waste milk. Take a pass on this one."
2,has a weird taste,"I love most different kinds of tea but this one just isn't as good as the others. If you want a better taste, just make some black tea and put a little lemon juice in it. I'm not a big fan of the individually wrapped teabags either just because they make that much more trash to put in landfills."
4,Very smooth,The Tea provides that nice cozy feeling during those cool nights and soothes the throat when that nasty cold has taken hold.
1,Where's the Bergamot?,"I was hoping to like this tea as I love Earl Grey and some green teas and thought this would have more health benefits than the normal Earl Grey. I couldn't taste any bergamot to speak of in this tea. Also, even though I love Twinings Earl Grey and some green teas such as Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orchard, Salada, and others, I did not like combining the two. It was like I could not taste what was good about either teas in this and will now keep my black teas and my green teas separated from each other so that I can taste what is good about each in it's own way. Also, I've found the Bigelow's that I've tried so far to be rather flat and lacking any of the delicacy or subtle complexities of many other brands."
2,MOM,"disappointed in the flavor...they named is ""I LOVE LEMON""....sorry but they missed the mark on this and it is bland and bitter."
2,Disappointed,"Seeing the word ""tangy"" on the front of the box, I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart, vibrant raspberry herbal tea. Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J-ello! Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either. The first cup I made, I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip. I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box."
2,a good tea done wrong,this batch of tea (6 boxes) has too much clove.. hardly can tell the orange and cinnamon are in it.. what to do with all this tea?? I have had constant comment many times before and it had been a favorite..
1,It doesn't taste like it used to be. Too weak! like 3rd time with water,"The last shipping I got, the tea is so horrible. It is like the 3rd time that you put water in...It is so weak. It hardly tasted like green tea that I used to get. I don't know what wrong with it. I ordered 6 boxes/each. So, it took me a few months to finish all 6 boxes. With 2nd package with 6 boxes those a received about a couple months ago, they are so terrible. It almost does not smell like a real tea any more."
3,Best Earl Grey tea I ever tasted but...,"...Amazon fell off the service wagon on this one...the listing indicates that you're buying SIX boxes of the tea...what I received the last THREE times I ordered it, however, was only ONE box of tea...and this was despite the packing list clearly indicating that there should be SIX boxes in the shipment...customer service refunded my money but COULDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM...amazing!!...anyway, the tea is great and deserves five stars...Amazon's service is pathetic and should get less than one."
2,Got old fast.,"I'm a big fan/drinker of Green Tea and a big fan/drinker of Earl Grey, but this tea is a little too Bergamot-y for my taste. It may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea, and the Bergamot is therefore more evident.After a couple cups of this I decided these two tastes are best on their own."
1,Bigelow Teas,"Bigelow teas, to me, all taste watered down and bitter. No flavor and nasty to the pallette. Waste of money on this purchase. Yuck."
2,twinings is better,Disappointed. Wanted to give it a try but flavor is not as good as Twinings. Costing the same as Twinings.
3,not individually wrapped,"i really wish they would have made it more clear that these ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS. they come in a pack of 4, which i guess for some people might be okay but i think i would rather have individually wrapped :/"
2,Very disappointed,"This review is specific to the Bigelow Chinese Oolong TeaAfter drinking this tea several times from whole leaves, I admit I made a mistake in purchasing it as tea bags...even if the product comes in individual packed tea bags and under the Bigelow brand. The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening. The tea bags are nothing like it. It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this. Get it as whole leaves.I will continue drinking this (120 bags @ $16) but I won't enjoy it but winter is coming, I'll have reason to drink tea...or find someone who likes this and give it to them."
5,delicious,"I was about to order some of the Bentley's pomegranate tea when I saw this one come up in the search, and thought I'd give it a try instead. The Bigelow has a much stronger fruity flavor and has instantly become one of my favorite teas. Yum!"
3,Just Alright,"I normally drink Stash Earl Grey tea, but I thought I'd give Bigelow a shot since I love Constant Comment so much. I'm not sure if I'm just too accustomed to Stash (I usually buy the double bergamot flavor, so it's extra orangey, but the regular is almost just as orangey), but I just don't get enough of the bergamot flavor. I feel like the black tea flavor is overpowering the bergamot. It's pretty good, and I won't have any problem going through this box, but I'm sticking with Stash."
5,My first taste of tea,I love this tea! It was the very first tea (except for Lipton) that I ever tasted. It has such a smooth taste. Everyone will enjoy this tea.
5,good tea - good service!,Thank you so much for your wonderful service - THAT is the way internet buying is supposed to work!
5,As Expected,Was as expected and was shipped ontime. One of my favorite teas. It was a good price and is fresh.
5,Fabulous Raspberry Tea!,I get this stuff on a regular basis from Amazon. Great price. This tea smells sooooo good! The minute you tear open the little wrapping on the tea bag you can smell the raspberries! This is the ONLY raspberry tea I buy - Bigelow's! Amazon has the unbeatable best price for this stuff. That's why I get it from Amazon.
5,My husband's favorite tea.,The stores around here don't sell Cinnamon Tea. I agree with my husband that this is a really good tea!
3,tea is good but labeling misleading,"Bigelow tea in general is usually pretty good and the Earl Grey is a hit at the hotel I manager. For English however I prefer PG Tips but that's just my preference.I ordered this tea for the 97 room hotel I work at, to put in the rooms. 240 bags of tea at an awesome price! However, when I opened the tea up, we found that while yes, there is 240 bags, they are packaged 4 bags to a pouch. Maybe I overlooked this in the description somewhere. I checked again but did not see that anywhere.But now I know and hopefully this will help someone else. if you are looking for individually wrapped tea bags, do not get the 40 count box packs! Get the 20 count ones! (works out to be the same price)"
5,The BEST! Absolutely Delicious!,I find this Peach Green Tea to be the BEST and I do not tire of drinking it everyday...usually 4-6 cups daily. Some green tea is overly bitter and trying to drink it everyday gets to be a chore rather than a pleasure. But not this Bigelow tea. There is a perfect balance of the tea and peach flavor and it is easier on the stomach because the green tea flavor is fresh and delicate rather than astringent and overbearing. Bigelow has good quality control because every cup is equally yummy and there are no grassy or fishy flavors some other manufacturers' teas have. You can be confident that this is high quality tea and very enjoyable. Drink it by the case as I do...it tastes great and it is good for you to boot!
5,bEST TEA ON THE PLANET,"This tea has the most out of this world aroma and taste. Not to high in caffeine, it entices all your senses. Had my first cup this morning and i'm in love. I ordered six boxes so I dont know when I will be ordering more, might be soon."
2,Cinnamon Way Too Strong,"I love peach tea (and anything peach flavored), but this has has a cinnamon flavor that is too strong. I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I did. I don't like the cinnamon flavor. To me, peach and cinnamon don't belong together. Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter. This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea, but then again, not, because peach is too summery. Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor. As soon as I finish this box, I will not buy it again.The cinnamon is way too strong. It made me sick at my stomach, and the aftertaste is horrible."
4,Great tea - be informed about packaging,"This is a great decaffeinated organic green tea - especially, since there aren't that many choices on the market today. However, I wish I'd read some of the reviews before ordering so that I understood that the bags are not individually wrapped. There are 4 bags to a package. Which has its pluses and minuses, in my opinion. I like to take tea with me when I go out to eat and it's much more convenient, for me, to have one tea bag in a package, rather than four. But, how picky do you want to get? And, is it enough to keep me from purchasing this product again? I'm not sure? It's probably the best value around but, for me, there is definitely a trade off between value and convenience."
5,I love this tea!,"This is one of my favorite flavored black teas. It's a toss-up between this tea and Black Lychee tea. The flavor is truly exquisite, fruity but not overbearing and smooth, reminds me a little of a sweet wine. I've tried pomegranite flavored green teas and do not like them. This black pomegranite tea from Bigelow, however, is something else. Try it for yourself."
2,"Flat, No Depth Chai","I was disappointed with this chai, particularly after the stellar reviews. I love chai and have been drinking it for years but was looking for a decaffeinated version. In my view, this tea has no depth and little flavor. Even using two tea bags, I came away with a flat cup of tea. The only thing good about this chai was the price."
5,"Crisp, refreshing-hot or cold","We start our day with a cup of this delightful tea. It is crisp and refreshing-hot or cold. Unlike some green teas that tend to be overpowering, it has a light, but distinct flavor. The touch of lemon makes it perfect. Highly recommend it for those who love green tea, but don't care for the usual musty flavor."
3,Average Tea,Good price for organic but the flavor is very mild almost no green tea flavor and the bags are bleached unlike most organic teas I have purchased.
2,"good, but not as advertised","this is a fairly good asst. of teas, but they sent me an updated version of the product, and I'm not happy with the new asst. it's not as described in the desc. it has pomegranite tea instead of apple cinnamon, and I was buying it to get the apple cinnamon, so I hope someone reads this and doesn't make the same mistake I did.I want my apple cinnamon tea"
1,"The tea smells wonderful, but loses aroma once it brewed.","I am afraid this tea does not have flavor of Earl Grey. If you want to make a strong tea, the bitter taste will come out. The tea smells wonderful in a bag, but somewhat its aroma went away once it brewed."
5,green tea,bigelow green tea is great tea my wife and i drink a lot of it. we go thruogh a case or a month. The flavor is very relaxing and heavnly
4,"Not a sleep aid, but good to unwind with","Sweet Dreams does not get me drowsy like some people may say. But the taste for some reason and the smoothness, mildness of it seems perfect for a before bed drink. Even the purple color it makes just looks like a relaxant. Good to help you clear your mind before bed. Again, I'm not saying it will, so don't depend on it. It's just one of the best drinks to add to your bed time routine. Don't drink it during the day, because it might make you lose your psychological association with sleep because that's all it really is."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I had picked up a few packets of I Love Lemon tea somewhere, and decided it would be the perfect nighttime soother. However, I could not find it in any of my local grocery stores. Since I purchase another tea from amazon.com on a regular basis, I checked and found I Love Lemon was available also. It's so nice to have it delivered right to my home, and at a lower price than what I would have paid in the grocery. But now, the downside is that my friend in Baltimore doesn't know what to send as a gift."
2,Not the same tea that you get in the supermarket,"I have had at least one cup earl grey per day for years and my fravote was always The Bigelow Earl Grey, this was first time I purchase them from Amazon, I'm not sure if the color of packing makes any difference, but the package arrived was sliver not gold. The tea was very weak and aroma is extream light, NOT at all the Earl Grey I expected. Will NOT order this product again."
5,My favorite tea,"This is a marvelous flavor of tea and is even good luke-warm as the flavor is stronger when less than hot,hot."
