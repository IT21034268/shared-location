4,Another Sweet Mystery,"This is the 3rd Tea Shop Mystery I've read and I enjoyed it. It's not great literature, but it's still a great way to occupy the bus ride to/from work. It's pretty much the same as the others in the series, of course, with a new murder. The one thing that I found annoying is that the author kept talking about how beautiful Theo is and how wonderful her hair is. Theo seems pretty much perfect with a perfect life and I would like to see a bit more realism with her. My other little gripe is when she veers away from the plot. For example, the bits with Earl Grey the service dog are pretty much pointless. Again, Theo is a saint with an angel of a dog. A service dog is a wonderful thing, but there's no need to have an entire chapter in every book dedicated to the trip to the senior home. It would be different if a clue came out of it. Other than that, it's still a good story with wonderful atmosphere."
2,"clunky writing, predictable plot & characters",Too bad this wasn't better written. This could have been a cute series.
1,To much extra unnecessary info,I have read all of the books in this series up to this and I am almost finished with this book. The stories are ok but there is too much extra unnecessary info. The author is obsessed with tea I like tea and a few tea facts are fine but there is too much She also is living in the 60s ladies do not wear gloves except to keep their hands warm in the winter. There was a reference summer gloves. I am no expert on Charlston SC but I have been there many time during the 24 years I spent living in NC I have been up and down the carolinas coast and there are many in accuracies about Charlston and the surounding areas its very frustrating. When I took writing classes in school I was always told to write about what you know and when you dont do your research
3,"Play it again, Sam","I do really enjoy Laura Childs Tea Shop Murder Mystery series and will continue to buy future offerings. Her descriptions of Charleston, tea information, recipes, etc. are a great part of each book. However, there can be too much of a good thing. Sometimes,the book reads like a travel promotion. The pace of the mystery and flow of the story are interrupted by these tidbits of information, delightful as they are. The back stories of the main characters seem to be repeated too often as well. I assume this is for first time readers late to the series. Perhaps, she could include an appendix that provides this information like Marilyn Pappano does in her multi-volume Bethlehem series.I would like to see more focus on the plot or more thought on when to inject history, tea info, etc. Keep them coming, Laura!"
4,Pleasant read!,"This is my first time of reading Laura Child's work. I enjoyed it - no foul language, nothing to make me cringe in embarassment either! Good plot and I enjoyed the recipes too! Will enjoy reading more of her books."
3,Author or still the Ad Exec?,"Laura Childs' books make for a fun, light read, I'll not deny it. They are great for the bus ride home from work. My one irritation when reading this series is that her books appear to be sponsored by ""Jeep"" and other products. Ms. Childs can't say ""Theo gets in her car"" or ""she opens her handbag/purse"". I feel her publisher must be whichever corporate sponsor is paying her to plug their products. In some cases identifying a product works, but in Chamomile Mourning I was bludgeoned to death with ""Jeep"". That said, if you read whatever ""generic"" fits instead of Laura Child's product plugs, the books are quite fun."
3,"Interesting stories, well written","Why would a retired female pastor buy a book titled Blown Away? Because for the first time in my life, after retiring to Texas, I live every day with some measure of fear. And it's not just the number of women who die a violent death here. It's also a police force that shoots first and asks questions later. So I bought this book to see if it would change my mind about owning a gun. It didn't. The book is well written, and many of the stories are compelling. Other stories, however, seem contrived. Which is one reason I'm not convinced gun ownership is the answer. But if you're curious about why some women have chosen to arm themselves, this book is a pretty good start."
3,Fair honest documentary,"1980's documentary styled, its a fair honest sharing with minimal nudity. Lots of talking, like witnessing private therapy sessions. Do wonder if there are any surragotes out there to help."
3,Leaves unanswered questions,"I've looked into working with as sex surrogate before, but this video left me skeptical for the following reason: The overwhelming majority of men lose their virginity ""organically,"" so to speak, in their teens or early 20's, resulting in a spontaneous order that nobody planned.Those of us who miss that stage in our psycho-sexual development and try to compensate for it years later by working with a surrogate seem to want to force a planned order on their situations. But in the real world, attempts at imposing planned orders on systems that want to work organically, for example socializing market economies, often don't produce the results we want.So I have to ask: How many adult virgin men who have an adequate sexual experience but under artificial conditions with a surrogate often discover later that they still can't start anything like a normal adult sex life?"
3,I think you better squeeze,My friends and I saw this documentary on HBO in the Very late 80's in college had us cracking up although it is a documentary
2,not very sturdy,Lasted only one season in our pool. I would not even think of taking this out on any type of natural body of water unless you are wearing a PFD and are looking forward to a swim back to land. This is a TOY Boat and should be treated as such
4,works like a tent should,"Nice size, does take 2 to set up to avoid cracking of the poles. My main requirement for getting a tent is that it has windows/doors on all 4 sides, this one does as well as the large roof mesh skylight.Would be nice if it had some method to help sweep it out since the bottom lip on the front door is about 8 inches high, but a dustpan is not that much more to pack to assist with that.It didn't rain on us this trip so can't comment on the wet weather capabilities, but it looks like it will handle it well."
3,A Marginal Miss for Masso,"While any Masso is better than no Masso, this Masso is not in the same class as 'The Wonderful World of George Gershwin' or 'C'est Magnifique'. But then, that would be a tall order indeed. For Masso fans, 'Play Arlen' is still one for the CD rack - to be played when you just can't get enough of the man."
2,Well....I love these Gals but...,"I know I read this book and I remember raving about it to preety much everyone I met 2 years ago. For the life of me I cannot remember what the book was ABOUT. That is the feeling you will get when you read this book kinda like Chinesse food, a great feeling and something you want to tell your friends about but ultimity forgetable."
2,Disappointing mythic/historical tale,"I have enjoyed the Adept series and the other works of these authors. I am of Scots descent and was intrigued to see the use of the backdrop of the Scottish struggle for sovereignty as a stage for the occult themes.I was very disappointed in the story and it took me a day or two to realize that one of the reasons is that there are NO WOMEN in this book at all - except for an evil pre-Christian Goddess. (Who doesn't even seem to have any female worshippers.) Granted the main characters are militant monks, but surely somewhere in their Scottish wanderings or in one of the subplots there is room for the distaff side.This book, and its sequel, The Temple and the Crown, are relentless in their portrayal of good Christians vs horrible diabolists of one sort or another. I'm slogging along through the sequel but whether I will actually finish the thing is in doubt. I'm amazed that it is possible to make the stories of William Wallace and Robert Bruce boring."
4,Another Templar series,"Katherine and Deborah are writing yet another Knights Templar series, but in olden times instead of modern times.These 2 women seem very taken with the romanticized version of the Knights Templar and make their non-Templar characters unable to function without said Templars.That being said, this book has quite a bit of action with little physical combat and is slightly fast-paced. Supernatural monsters, paganism, Scotland and politics abound here.I liked the book, yet in all honesty I very much preferred the earlier Adept series and I think Kathy and Debby should write more Adept books rather than starting a new series. The characters in the Adept books feel more alive and 3 dimensional while Arnault and gang are more 2D, in keeping with their era."
1,"Great premise, but poor execution","I was drawn to this book by reading the back cover. How could anything revolving the story about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce be anything but good. I didn't even mind the battle between christian and pagan religions. It just seemed that whenever the Templars got in trouble they pulled out their Celtic stone, said some prayers and all was well. I was given the second book and will attempt to slog my way through it as I travel, however, I am so far not impressed 57 pages into it. I wish that the execution of this story and plot could have been done better as the idea was fantastic. I enjoyed some of the historical points of the book, but as written in earlier reviews they were repeated entirely too many times! I wouldn't buy this book if your looking for a fun, romping tale of the Knights Templar. Could have been much better."
1,Periods of drama and long lapses of boredom,"I can make this one quick...interesting idea...too long...horrible ending.I like the new perspective of William Wallace, but he doesn't enter the story until about 250 pages have dragged by. There are some exciting glimpses into ""dark"" characters and mystery but they are few and far between. The authors involve FAR too much conversation between characters and they constantly rehash the same things over and over and over. Chapter 35 was the true end of the story - great climatic drama. Chapter 36 was so incredibly dull that I skimmed it, read the epilogue and gladly put this book away! Not a keeper and not one I would recommend. Enough to keep you trying to find redeeming value and a sorry disappointment for your efforts."
3,"Temple and The Stone, good half story","Advise skipping first two parts of book. First two parts are bogged down in too much developement of history to support second two parts of book. Book covers a large time span and story does not flow smoothly. After reading the Adept series written by these two authors, this was a big disappointment."
5,A True Grimoire,"This little book of degree symbols is remarkable for its accuracy and uneven-ness. Instead of providing a simple, bland, and consistently positive interpretation of each image, this book runs the gamut from the grim and harsh to the exalted and subtle. I have used it in my astrological practice for 40 years, and have often been astonished at the precision of its interpretations. Some people believe that because of its age, the careful practitioner should adjust for the precession of the equinoxes before applying the symbols to the degrees of a modern horoscope. However, I have found that rounding up to the next whole degree works just fine. If you have access to the ""Long Form"" of the Marc Edmund Jones/Elsie Wheeler degree symbols, they often suggest an antidote for the darker tones of this text; conversely this work reveals those tones where the Jones' Sabian Symbols glosses them over."
3,some very funny scenes although not a very good plot.,"Anthony Michael Hall's acting seemed a bit on the choppy side, yet made the movie more hilarious. I couldn't tell if the acting was intentional or not so I can't say that it was bad, because, in a way, I thought was very funny. I couldn't have thought of a story like it if I tried, so it's very unique. I watched it several times and laughed through a lot of it. I'd like to see it again. I'd definitely recommend at least a one time viewing for anyone who hasn't seen it."
3,Take Note,"This file must be used in one direction only-NOT in a back & forth motion like other higher quality files.The wooden handle needs to be glued immediately as it slips right off.Lots of strokes to crown a fret is time consuming . Will see how it holds up for 4 guitar necks, but my guess is I'll be upgrading as this takes more time and thus patience to get the job done."
2,"Good for spot filing, but dulls quickly","The fret crowning file was easy to use, but I found that it dulled very quickly - I could not completely crown the frets on my guitar neck with this tool. The guitar in question is an epiphone from the 90s, and had badly worn frets - but the fret wire was nothing exotic. I leveled the frets (a bit of work), then began crowning them with this tool (a lot of work). But this file was essentially worn out after 7 frets had been crowned. So I need to order a different file.I know that this file cuts in only one direction, and is not as expensive as the diamond files - consequently my expectations were calibrated for hobby-level use. But nevertheless the file should stand up to a complete set of frets before wearing down."
1,"Poorly made, expensive junk","I received this tool and was eager to use it to crown the frets on a personally valuable instrument. First, I could not get the bits to stay seated in the tool - even using a hex key wrench to tighten the screw - poor design. I then started trying to crown (carefully) and noticed that the teeth of the medium fret file insert (the one I needed) were dull compared with those on the other bits.Poor design. Poor quality control. I expected better."
5,Good book,"The good thing about this book is the long list of programs in the back of the book. I've tried for a long time to find a list of programs that complete. Also, I thought the book was easy to read and had some great advice."
3,details of 6 yr med school,some more details could be good as a new updated version with up to date info.
5,Excellent Introduction on Astronomy Fundamentals,"I was impressed with these books (set of 3 volumes) the very first time I saw them.The introduction in the first book brings a beginner up to speed on what is really happening 'out there'. For beginners and seasoned amateurs alike, it helps you to appreciate the objects in the universe, their sizes, the scale of the universe, and our place in it. They help a person to answer the question, ""What do I look for?"". The long introduction is both a fine tutorial, and a great review, to help one get and keep 'the big picture' in mind.The books inculde a massive amount of detailed information on objects in every constellation. They earn their own way to a place in my library."
5,Undoubtedly helpful,"As I told in my previous review (bernardo@esfm.ipn.mx, 1998), Burnham's Handbook continues to be a daily reference for most amateur astronomers because it hasn't been surpassed, even rivalled.We all know that the coordinates it gives are not the current ones. We all know that some of its data is out of date. We all know that its typing is old-fashioned. We all know that its pictures are not digital. But we all also know that it is one of the most useful astronomy sources around."
5,Right Stuff,"Perfect solution to a small drip on my portable generator carb. I only used a small quantity, and it has permanently dried up my troubles."
4,Old School surprise,This movie had surprisingly Good action. The Plot was a little slow moving though. Two great fights go on simultaneously in the Last 20 minutes & the end fight is awsome.
5,Israre Under Fire,"An amazing book dealing with Bible Prophecy and current events. These two authors continue to produce excellent commentary on how news headlines fall into line with the predictions of the prophets as guided by God in His Holy Word. This book quotes middle east and U.S. leaders to show that Israel and Jerusalem remain the very center of the universe in God's plan for His earth. The book is very well written as expected from Dr. Ankerberg and easily understod. Many relative questions are answered in the last chapters, also."
1,"I second the ""publicist"" review","I also received an email from a ""fake"" library patron asking if we would consider buying this book for the library. I read the review and thought the book did sound interesting, however it will not be on our shelves due to the underhandedness of those trying to sell the book. I certainly hope you turn to a more honorable marketing strategy before you lose more prospective customers."
1,Misleading title,Confusingly this book is not about hedge funds or how they trade except at the most basic level. Around half of the book is a collection of sensible risk management ideas which will be instructive to anyone new to the profession of trading and investment. The other half is a bizarre political/economic rant in favour of Austrian economics. This will make anyone who knows anything about the subject cringe but will probably appeal to the political bias of the intended audience.
1,"If Soros was a prof, Boucher was one of his 'C' students","Like many books written by practitioners, ""The Hedge Fund Edge"" provides some insight as to how one man makes his living, warts and all. By warts, I mean specious reasoning by the author. One of the warts in this book is a misunderstanding of basic macroeconomics. For example, Boucher presents capital input growth as productivity growth. The 'models' presented in the book are vapid space filler and could have been taken from an undergraduate's class presentation. All of the models could have been summarized neatly on one page rather than several dozen. Also, there are multiple typographical errors and citation errors throughout the book.The author likely used the phrase 'hedge fund' to tap into a hot topic in order to sell more books. This book is not about hedge funds, it's about global macro trading. You can learn more about global macro trading in the preface to Soros' ""Alchemy of Finance"" than you'd get out of this entire book."
1,I agree mostly with Foxwold's review,"Foxwold (his review is above mine), gave no stars to this book but I give it one. Ultimately, I think Foxwold is right that the author doesn't appear to really be an enthusiast about the history of spices.The book is not a comprehensive view of the subject by any means, but I would still enjoy the it as a whole had it mitigated against the normal 'dry' result of reference works by being an interesting read. Dalby doesn't manage to do this at all... The style of writing is not nicely flowing and the way in which the information is organized is sterile and uninteresting. I gave him one star because I learned a FEW interesting things while reading it but ... if I am not looking at an encyclopedia or a reference text, then I want my reading material to be stimulating too."
1,You Got to be kiding me,"Who ever thinks we DIDN'T go to the moon is just plain NUTS. this film is near 4 hrs of pure junk. They didn't appear to get even ONE astronaut to interview. Make sure you watch other more credible Documentaries about the space program mainly from the astronauts point of view. try ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" for starters."
4,Fine production,"Enjoyed this video series very much. Lot's of footage, interviews and historical facts that make it hard for one to believe that the official record is accurate. My major degree was Theatre Arts. Rule #101 is how to distinguish ""live"" from ""memorex."" The whole space program appears to become more and more memorex everyday now since viewing this excellent program."
3,Good but not great,"I like the stories, several are very clever, but the leading characters are a bit too weak, Holmes in particular is often quite rude. The dialog of Holmes and Watson doesn't ring true enough often enough.The other part that's disappointing is the paucity of clever deductions that makes reading the canon so much fun. Holmes could tell a lot about a person by examining their watch, etc., but here we have little of those delightful moments that reveal the great man's talent."
4,Not bad...not pleased with last case ending,"Just about every story in this book was well-written. I liked the premise of the last case but did not like how it ended. I don't want to give too much away but I didn't think a book of this type should end on such a ""turn"". I'll leave it up to other readers to determine if it was a good idea. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book though."
4,"Good going, my dear Stockwell!","This book captures the heart and soul of Sherlock Holmes quite well except for the last story. There is no way that Holmes would deliberately expose Watson to such danger. Holmes often did not take Watson into his full confidence, simply because Watson was an astutely honest face that was poor at any form of deception. But as Sherlockians may recall in The Adventure of the Three Garridebs when the villian wounds Watson, Holmes coldly informs him that if Watson had been killed the villian would never have left the room alive. So having Holmes expose Watson to deadly danger and then be caviler about it is unthinkable. But the rest of the book is a solid four Sherlock stars! Good work! Write some more and pay more careful attention to detail. Quoth the Raven..."
1,Clever plots but poor writing...,"While most of the stories are based around clever plots and stories the tone and overall writing ruins any sense of authenticity.The stories sound 20th century...since when do English gentlemen in Victorian times use words like ""a lot""?? Also while tame by today's standards, many of the words (hell, damn) are used too frequently and would have been considered completely inappropriate during the late 1800's.Some of the mysteries are not mysteries at all but odd stories about nothing in particular.The writer should have followed the tone and style of the originals..."
3,Eh...,"For one, I very much disliked how the book began. The book begins outlining the death of Sherlock Holmes, as a Sherlockian that will never occur to me. Holmes lives and will continue to. The stories were mediocore to me and I moved through the book slowly as the interest was not complete."
1,Hard to register,"Do yourself a favor and buy the Adams one from Staples. These people are too paranoid about unprovided serial numbers .. It also will not work after 12 15 01. If you like being on hold, buy it."
2,about as good as any,"This works about the same as most sold by other humidifier companies to clean them, but no better really. I have found the best is white or distilled vinegar with peroxide but please do not stand over or have your eyes close to the fumes from this combination as it can be long term harmful to vision according to studies done on these products. As long as you leave the room for the soak in the sink or in the product base, and then come to rinse it in plain water, that has come to be my favorite combination for cleaning and descaling. Not straight vinegar and peroxide but mixed in water, like gallon of water, cup of vinegar, half or quarter cup of peroxide. This also will kill any mold or mildew that might have developed."
5,Great EP!,This is the 4AD/Elektra Digipak. So soooo goood!This EP contains:1. Cannonball2. Cro-Aloha (demo version of No Aloha--very goood)3. Lord of the Thighs (Aerosmith cover singed by Josephine Wiggs)4. 900 (this song is by Josephine Wiggs)
1,False Advertising,"I ordered the ""Epson"" ""Twin Pack"" cartridges and received an off-brand ""G&G"" pair of cartridges. I complained to Amazon but was told it's not their problem as the used another vendor to ship the products. They said that I should try to negotiate with the other vendor and if not satisfied AND after 30 days had expired I could then try to get satisfaction from Amazon. Of course I need the cartridges NOW or not be able to print, so I had to use them. I asked Amazon to at least not advertise them as Epson, but they said it's not false advertising if the other vendor doesn't deliver what Amazon promises !"
2,Don't Buy these Here unless they are definitely in stock,"I originally ordered mine in October, and had extended the order. I neglected to extend the last order and now the promotional discount I used has expired. Hmmm? Nothing wrong with the cartidges though."
3,Huh?,"I bought this online because I could no longer buy this at my local office supply store and was told by the salesperson that it could only be purchased online. I buy a lot of things from amazon and thought I would take a chance and buy it here. After using it for about two weeks, the color is not coming out quite right. I checked the level of ink and it is fine but now I have a lot of pink with black. I went through the maintenance wizard and it's still not working quite right. I guess I will have to buy this online from the favorite office supply store."
1,Bad Ink cartriges,I purchased these items and found out that they were defective. On top of that they were 11 years old. I had to go to Office Depot and purchase them all over again. I just thought you should know.
2,Jagger?,It's a good rock album. With all songs written by a guy named Hasty Pudding. This guy sounds a lot like Mick Jagger. The first track 'Turns to Gold' also appears on a Mick Taylor solo album. Any Stones fan should give it a listen.
1,Stale Juice,"Contrary to the claim on the box, Jackie's newest is mostly a rehash of old jokes without any comic energy. Early in the show Jackie passes aimless conversation with the audience off as ""new"" material. Even Jackie becomes frustrated at one point when he asks whether anyone is actually there in the audience. When his rambling fails to capture the audience he pulls material from his Broadway show out of his hat but without any comic energy. In fact, Jackie seems tired or bored throughout the show. Uncharacteristic for Jackie, his show seems unrehearsed and unplanned...as if he was asked to get up and wing it. Don't bother investing in this DVD as the title is misleading and the performance is poor."
2,A wonderful comedian... but not here,"Jackie Mason is one of the great stand-ups, but you wouldn't know it from this performance. The production values are almost non-existent: 1 camera at the back of the auditorium which moves in and out of focus, no extras, no music, no features. All this, of course, would be immaterial if the show were magic. But it isn't. He's a little off his game, the audience takes a while to warm up (vehement anti-french gags don't go down well in Canada) and, as everyone else has said, the material is far from '100%' new. This is part of Jacky Mason's charm, and even the new bits feel familiar... it's in his tone, timing and expressions. But all three are off-key in this performance, so this DVD's only for completists. First-timers should look to buy a recording of Mason on Broadway or in the West End, where he always rises to the occasion!"
1,Rip off,"What a huge disappointment. Despite what it says on the box - that this is 100% new material - it is in fact all stale material with a very occasional (and superficial) re-focus. I am a Mason fan, but this clear disregard for his fans' money and gullibility is disappointing"
5,A cracker,"This has got to be one of the most interesting reads for a few years. Cambridge professor and evolutionay paleontologist Conway Morris essentially develops the almost Platonic conception of convergent evolution, suggesting that there are perfect solutions out there, and that nature has found them again and again. He illustrates this with numerous examples, living and from the fossil record. A brilliant book who's central thesis is hard to shake off and which will stay will you for a long time."
2,This is a poorly written book on a fascinating topic.,"However, the author convinced me that the traditional Darwinian camp, represented by Dawkins, is reductive and inadequate, and that the gene isn't the fundamental agent of evolution. The theological ideas towards the end of the book are unconvincing though. I hope that scientists continue to pursue these ideas of convergent evolution because it has important implications for understanding ""the meaning of life,"" but it's obvious that this area of study is in a very primitive stage. I hope to find some better-written and more engaging books on this topic."
2,Not good enough or convincing enough,"As another reviewer wrote Conway Morris produces lots of examples like Darwin. However unlike Darwin the examples aren't convincing, we fail to go from the 'could have' to 'must have'. Attacking both sides in the great evolution debate (both Dawkins and Gould come in for a hammering) also doesn't help - there's not really enough room for a third front! And the last two chapters are just disastrous ultimately meaningless waffle. Get this book from a library"
4,Essential for Vigiling the Dying....,This book is a *godsend* to those who are attending the dying..I not only use this book with my own patients as they prepare to make their transition out of the body in to what comes next..I also use and recommend it as a text in several Conscious Living and Dying classes I teach.Personally I prefer the spiral bound edition for ease of use..It is also helpful in referencing back to facilitate healing during the bereavement processes of friends and family.Katherine Rosengren RN MA
1,expired software,I just bought this software- Sept. 2002- and it should NOT have been sold! It has been expired for over 9 months. Buying permission to use it cost the same amount as this years version; don't waste your money like I did!
1,Expired 5 months no credit or upgrade,My wife is a dentist and only needs to refrence this source on an occasional basis. So I installed and used the disk once and tried agian several months later it did not work.. When I finally got around to calling support they told me that they expire the database approx 18 months after the release with no upgrade and no access *** BE Aware** the CD version is worthless after a relatively short period of time.
5,Moving History,"This is a moving, enlightening history of one African-American family in the pre-War South. The strength, anguish, resourcefulness, and bravery of the enslaved are highlights of their story. And movement: there is movement across the South, North, and West as people seek freedom and destiny. We are fortunate that both whites and blacks kept records, journals, and letters -- and that the authors used them so well to tell this story. I like this book so much that I've given it as a gift."
3,An extended yet focused case study,"_Promised Land_ does indeed cover an interesting family. The true tales of the Thomas clan, descendents of a ""semi-free"" entrepreneuring slave in mid-ninteenth-century Nashville, have the potential to enlarge the boundaries of our imagination of American history. The telling is another matter: far less imaginative. Much of what one learns in _Promised Land_ one could get more amusingly and emotionally wrenchingly from Edward Jones's _The Known World_. If one prefers history in non-fiction, though, _Promised Land_ is a good bet."
2,"Easy read, but forgettable.","I found Mr. Mosley's writing style very juvenile. First of all, there were several typographical errors, for which there is no excuse. Secondly, the character development was very week. Characters like Caldwell and the three officers who killed his family were never fully fleshed out. They remained one-dimentional throughout the entire book. Finally, the family dynamic was completely unbelievable. It was too fairy tale perfect, and was almost embarrassing.With that said, I did find the story interesting enough to keep reading until the end. It was an easy read, but very forgettable."
1,Force Five,copied from video to dvr repackaged in a nice case and sold. quality of disk blurred and fuzzy not worth buying at this outlandish price.
5,Beautiful Bast Necklace,I was very impressed with this necklace. As I collect almost everything that I can of Bast I was amazed at the detail put into this necklace.
3,"A beautiful book, if not very helpful.","The photography and poetry/prose in this book is phenomenal! However, if you are looking for a quality, practical book in yoga during pregnancy this isn't it. There are no descriptions nor illustrations of specific poses. It would be very difficult for someone with limited or no experience with yoga to pick up this book and find it useful. For a more practical book on yoga during pregancy I would recommend _Yoga for Pregnancy : Safe and Gentle Stretches_ by Sandra Jordan."
2,not a yoga guide,"This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book."
1,Pretty - but pretty useless,"Looks very nice and sturdy coming out of the box. I liked the idea of the immersible pot for easy cleaning. However, the electrical unit falls off too easily - in fact, the cord is placed so that it knocks itself off. But the worst part is the heat control. Despite Warm, Simmer, and 250 up to 300 degrees, in reality there are two temperatures: hot to the boiling point or OFF. At ""Warm,"" it kept at a constant rolling boil. Basically ruined the fondue and I wasted $13 on cheese, not to mention $40 on the pot.The instructions were also useless: One section says not to detach the electrical unit until the pot cools. Another says not to move the pot unless the electric unit is detached.A poorly designed mechanism, and this pot is going back to the store tomorrow."
1,Fondue Failure,"I really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box. It's looks well made and looked easy to use. I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer. I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes. When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad. I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat. I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say."
1,Health Hazard,"This product is a health hazard. The magnetic plug which sounds like a good idea (greater safety) does not stay connected securely. If you touch the pot or move it ever so slightly the pot looses power and the temperature in the put will fall. I purchased three of these for an event and it was endlessly frustrating to keep the pots connected. At one time I bit into raw chicken because the pot became unconnected and the cooking liquid was only warm instead of hot. Poor design, stay away."
2,This Was A Gift - Giver Not Happy,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and having had a very successful several years as an Amazon customer, thought nothing further about it. However, I found out from the recipient that the packaging looked like it had been previously returned. There was no paperwork, no directions, no warranty information, no safety information, nothing to speak of. While she was happy to receive the gift, we were both very surprised to find only the fondue pot and the forks. Unfortunately, the box was thrown away, thus making a return or exchange impossible. Buyer beware!"
2,"Slippin, Fallin', Can't get up.....","What happened to the sound and energy that made this label so awesome. Its seems as though no one really cared on this one. Like it was just another to add to the bunch. Pure Pleazure, Denine, and Sammy C carry this cd and keep it from sinking....."
4,I Agree With Big Nose,"Peppermill works great and looks nice, but it holds surprisingly few peppercorns--I'm refilling it all the time. But it's easy to adjust the grind and it works like a champ. If it ever falls apart I'll get the bigger one. If you're like me and you like fresh ground pepper on your salads, steaks, potatoes, sauted veggies and just about everything else, do yourself a favor and buy the larger size."
3,scratched...and bad service from store...,"I got the camera, no manual and no connecting cord - and I'm upgrading to this so I am a newbie trying to get a professional 3 chip camera...well, found out it prosumer not professional as advertised...then, found the manual for myself on line - and Staples computer expert, and Best Buy's guys...nobody has a cord or knows about the manual info...so I go back to the store and all they do is send me a link to the manual...so I finally figure out - not with any of their help!!! that I have to have a firewire plug on the computer side and a 4 pin on the camera side...but none of this came from the store...so my advice is, if you buy from them YOU ARE TOTALLY ON YOUR OWN."
4,I think they left off clear vision.,"Purchase new VX-2100 in September 2008 & did so based on the fact I have had a Sony VX-2000 for 5 years. The VX-2000 has a clear eye viewer and the VX-2100 reminds me of looking through a plastic toy microscope. Still has all the good quality of VX-2000 but, a very cheap eye piece."
5,A must for any TMBG fanatic.,"This CD has 4 classic TMBG tracks availale nowhere else. They are also some of the best and most unique songs THEY have ever written. The progressive tempo of Mrs. Train and the dark, moody feel of She Was a Hotel Detective demonstrate some of THEIR finest work. No fan is complete without this."
2,Not any better than a piece of padded handlebar tape,This material really isn't any more cushioned than a piece of padded handlebar tape. My recommendation is to save a little bit of your old padded tape and use it under your newly taped bars. Same result.The Fizik product is easy to cut to contour the bars and is packaged nicely but overall I would not buy again.I have used the Cinelli gel inserts and they are definitely more cushioned (but thicker too). I will go back to the Cinelli product.
3,May not be all that necessary,"I got these in conjunction with some proper bar tape. My girlfriend had been losing feeling in her hands after some of our longer rides. Not good! She had absolutely crappy tape to begin with, so an update was definitely needed. I pulled out the stops and got this on top of SRAM Supercork tape.Installation was pretty easy. Placement of the curved pieces was a little odd, but I got it pretty well lined up.Now, after having ridden on it for a while, she is much much happier. But, honestly, I think just having used the Supercork tape would've been sufficient. Or, even doubling up the tape at key points on her bar would've solved this problem. I can barely tell the difference between her bars and mine (mine only have Supercork tape on them).Still, she's happy and now sore hands and wrists aren't the limiting factor on our rides."
2,Barel minimum of padding,"This bar padding product is the least effective of any I have used in absorbing road shock and promoting comfort on the bars. If you are looking to simply fatten up the diameter of your handle bars, this will do a fine job, but don't expect much extra comfort over simple cork tape.A much better product is the Spenco brand bar padding. The Spenco product is a little more bulky, but not much. And it will do the job you are looking for in increasing comfort and reducing road shock on those less-than-perfect sections of road."
3,"uneven, but worth buying.","While tracks like Mary Anne, Rollercoaster, and the one-two-three punch of Starship, Revolution, and Suicide are good, the rest is a little give and take.For one thing, four of the ten tracks are covers (Mary Anne, Roller Coaster, Come Together, and Starship) which makes one wonder if there wasn't a show that had live versions of say, Call the Doctor or Come Down Easy, etc. That, and the disc sounds as if it was culled from multiple sources.Either way, the disc is worth buying, if only for the last three tracks."
5,Taang's Reissue of the old 'Performance',"This is a wonderful, blasted example of the Spacemen 3's euphoric, trance-inducing sound. Were there anyone to question the Spacemen's validity as an artistic entity in my presence I would wonder whether this individual might be missing the point. Features all the hits which led Forced Exposure to give them the monniker: ""Urine Salesmen of the Apocalypse"". Too great."
2,pictures referenced but not included,"I chose this book because I thought it would include pictures, however, I was sadly disappointed. Figures were referenced but not included in the book."
2,Maybe I Just Don't Get It?,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of a woodworking magazine writer I have come to respect. Though the book is on architecture I can see how many of the principles apply to furniture making as well. I understand what this author is saying, but sometimes thought that his geometric ""hidden"" relationships were somewhat stretched. I think I could probably do the same thing with any building if I looked at it long enough. It sometimes felt like a real tough read for me (it certainly helped me go to sleep many nights). Given this book appears out of print and he hefty price I paid for it, I would certainly look elsewhere if you are coming from the same direction I came from on the purchase. An understanding of the golden ratio, shadow lines and looking at some classic pieces (shaker, federal, etc.) will probably yield equal or better benefit to your own furniture design making. Though out of my league, I would stretch to say the same exact thing to an architect."
3,Re-Warmed Tale.,"Peter's Destiny is a short book aimed at elementary children. The story is a retelling of the events that happen in the movie version of C.S. Lewis' The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe but only the events that happen to Peter. The book is a movie tie-in and not much more. There really isn't much depth in the story and for anyone who has read the book or seen the movie, Peter's Destiny seems unnecessary. However, it does include several black-and-white film stills and sketchings as well as a map of Narnia near the beginning. For these reasons, the book might be popular for children who have only seen the movie and who really don't like to read much. Of course, I don't think C.S. Lewis would have approved of that, but thus is the state of modern American culture upon children."
1,difficult read,very hard to get into; it reads like a college literature assignment that you are supposed to decipher (not fun); not recommended
4,Tortelier: Strong on vitality,"Tortelier's interpretation of the Turangalla-symphonie shows a strong awareness of the frantic rhythmic vitality of the work, along with a true sense of sentimentality and pure passion in the slow and quiet 6th movement ""Jardin du sommeil d'amour"". The only weakness is that there are moments during the rhythmic dances of the ""Turangalla"" movements where a very slight lack of rhythmic precision mars the performance very slightly. Shelley's piano playing is bright and polished, if a little forward, and Hartmann-Claverie's ondes martenot is well balanced. All in all, Tortelier's performance makes for pleasureable listening, though it does not quite reach the heights of Rattle or Myung-Whun Chung's hallmark recordings of the work."
1,Not what you expect,"I had an old Barranca polisher- with single speed. I learned that to polish granite / marble variable speed had advantages. I decided to buy the MK polisher due to the reputation of MK. Barranca parts were hard to get. I had my first problem and called to order the speed control that failed- it prbably had 10-20 hours of polishing use. I was told that part is not available. I need to send the entire unit back to CA for them to try to fix it. I live in CT- and to ship the enire thing back is probably $25, then the fix, and another $25 to get it back.I should have bought a Flex-MK has made huge margins in importing Chinese products and don't think that parts need to be supplied. The consumer has a choice."
5,"So Far, Really Good","Recently bought this and have just finished two small roofs. ZERO jams, consistant depth (even with a ""cheesy"" compressor), and really easy to load and adjust. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING NOTE: This is my first roofing nailer, so I can't compare it to Bostich, PC, Senco..., but I'm really impressed with how well this one works. I expected some random problems, but so far have had NONE."
5,great tool,"this roofing nailer is nearly perfect. i couldn't imagine a thing to change. go to a good store and feel the difference in balance and feel to all the other tools. this one was lighter than every other roofing nailer that i tried, and many by a large margin. It shoots to a consistent depth every time too! Used it to roof a 2500 sf roof (used over 10k nails) and it didn't jam once, and very rarely (likely more my fault) it has a mis-fire"
5,Milwaukee 7120 coil nailer,"This is the first coil nailer I have owned but after putting on 60 plus squares of shingles I can't imagine that another brand costing much more than this one would work any better.Great product for the money, easy to use and load.Would buy again!!"
2,Can not finish the roof,"I bought brand new to do the roof for my house. It works perfectly until half way then it jammed about every time after 4-5 nails. I have to use a screwdriver to push back the part that drive the nail down. Even I put oil in, it still happens the same so I decide to return this roof gun."
5,Great Nailer,"I received my nailer in first rate condition. I first re-roofed a garage, went without a hitch at all. The next week I roofed the house (22sq) and not one miss fire or jam. I have been using 1' Nails for the garage and 1 1/4"" for the house. The gun was easy to adjust, just gotta remember to set it up for the length of nails your going to use. I ran it at 90lbs and worked like a charm. The price was outstanding for a new gun from Amazon. Showed several friends the gun and now they want to borrow it... Not a chance!! I would recommend this gun to anyone, homeowner, or professional."
5,For people who are serious about stir fry,"My family cooks with a wok at least 3 or 4 times a week so we have tried a lot of different woks in the last few years. We have tried the fancy Calphalon, but at 12 inches it was just to small and shallow for cooking family size dishes. Great if you are single or have no kids, but I have two hungry boys to fed. We have also tried the old fashion iron wok from China town. It was huge and tough as a nail but no non-stick coating so you better use lots of cooking oil or else a real work out to clean. So I was really glad to find this 14 inches wok with the excellent excalibur non-stick coating because it is big and deep like a real wok should be, and yet has the high tech coating to make it easy to live with. The excalibur coating is the best one I have used and can stand up to all the abuses in a real kitchen. Great product."
1,Non-stick surface is dangerous for high heat cooking!,"If you intend to use your wok for traditional high-heat cooking, don't get anything with a non-stick surface. At high heat, these non-stick surfaces can produce toxic fumes. They WILL also peel off over time, particularly if you use a traditional wok spatula. Get a traditional carbon steel wok, season it, don't use soap and it will last and last. I've had my carbon steel wok for over 20 years. Five years after purchasing, my non-stick wok is in the garbage."
5,I love it!,"I love this cd so much, I'm going to listen to it ALL the year and not just at Christmas!"
5,M Steamroller,Never get tired of listening to Chip's music. Will continue to purchase Chip's CD's as long as he produces them.
4,thrilling,To hear the change of pace for M-S is thrilling. As good as Pro Musica in the 60s and light and lively.
1,Very disappointed,This is a symphonic album. There is no singing. I wanted to hear the Mannheim Steamroller chorus sing Christmas songs. Their other Christmas songs are fantastic.
3,Not bad...,"I have other chip Davis music, and this isn't bad, but I have to say it isn't my favorite. You can picture the Renaissance Period when you hear this music."
5,Renaissance Party Must-have,"Roast the pig and get cracking! This is spirited, period music which will serve as the backdrop to any Renaissance event, but not lull you to boredom. Happy, uplisfting, moving."
5,Love This Kind of Music,All the beauty of old English music is rolled up into each of these holiday classics. Playing them takes me to old English castles and folk dancing at Christmas time. It's great for background music and atmosphere at a holiday gathering as well.
4,MANNHEIM RENASSIANCE,FOR THE MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER FANS.......GREAT CHANGE OF PACE! A PERIOD PIECE CD THAT WELCOMES A PLEASANT CHANGE. RECOMMENDATION FOR THE TRUE COLLECTORS OF MUSIC.
5,Great Renaissance Collection,"Boy, are there reviewers of this who don't know what they're talking about. The compositions here are not Davis', but the likes of Praetorius, Franck, et al.This is good stuff if you like the sounds of this period of music, which I do. I can't take a steady diet of it, but every now and then, and especially at the holidays, this is good CD's to spin."
3,"Beautiful Voice, Bad Choices","Short and Sweet.I love listening to this beautiful baritone's voice, but I really don't like his choice of songs on this album. Beautiful Dreamer is so hackneyed and I can't stand to listen to it (also why I didn't buy the Stephen Foster album). I did like is choice of two classic lieder by Schumann. I would have chosen more lieder for a different album, he does great things with it. The Live recording of Largo al factotum from Barber is distracting with audience claps and poor mics for the recording. You can hear him walking away from the mics (fading in and out). The absolute worst choice is ""Anything You Can Do"" from Annie Get Your Gun. It sounds nice but I hate this song. The rest of the songs swing from Sappy awful to beautifully sung.Bottom Line: Inconsistent and Not worth your money. He can do much better"
4,"10,000 Maniacs melancholy cover CD","10,000 Maniac's cover of REM's ""Don't Go Back To Rockville"" is worth the price of this single alone. The band offers an upbeat version of the classic, with Merchant's voice sounding full of melancholy and sorrow. This is the only cover i've ever heard that is actually better than the original!!! The title track, ""Candy Everybody Wants"" is also a delight....The only thing missing is the band's cover of Tom Waits' ""I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You"" which was available on the CASSETTE single, no longer made That was probably the band's greatest cover song....Check this out for their cover of Morrissey's ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"""
5,A gem!,"This is packed with three cover tunes that show just what the Maniacs are capable of. In fact, it could be argued that their cover of ""Don't Go Back To Rockville"" is better than REM's orignal recording. ""Sally Ann"" is haunting with echoing guitar stylings from Rob Buck and a lovely viola part from Mary Ramsey. She also plays a fine violin on Morrisey's ""Everyday is Like Sunday,"" which again, gives the original version a run for it's money. These songs are as good as any on ""Our Time In Eden."" Don't miss this little sonic treat!"
2,one nation underground - the fallout shelter in American Culture,"Ok book I would like more pictures of the different types of shelters - I remember this time , thanks for the Movie ""The Day After"" it showed us how stupid we were .."
3,didn't work,I used this product as directed and found that it was a waste of money. It didn't clean the pot or internal parts of the coffee maker that I wanted to clean.
1,"Not for all Coffee Makers, I.E. Keurig, Breville, or Cuisinart !","Not for all Coffee Makers, may work with Drip Coffee machines, BUT, this item plugged up my Keurig machine, as there are coffee maker parts that will collect particle's from this product (Even if you Fully Dissolve the packet)."
3,seems a little deceiving,"This disc didn't do anything when I inserted it into my computer DVD drive; although, it worked very well on my computer CD drive, CD player, and my home DVD player. In my opinion, the description on the Lens Cleaner disc is deceiving, because it reads ""Cleans CD & DVD Drives CD Players DVD players"". I was able to clean all my units except my computer DVD drive. The reason why I chose this particular Lens Cleaner was becuase I wanted an all in one cleaning disc. I could have chosen a cheaper one that didn't claim to clean DVD drives."
3,"Pretty color, cheap construction, design flaws","The blue color looks really attractive - its an attention grabber. The problem with the docking cradle and the clasp are very real. I just got my case and it does not close shut fast. This is not a problem with a weak spring, its a problem with inaccurate plastic molding.The folks at Ideo who designed this case need to go back to the drawing board.I would probably not buy this again, its worth more like $... than the list."
3,"Good protection, poor design","Yah, it's like a tank protecting your palm, but you can't get the palm comfortably into the cradle with it on. I ended up keeping the cradle at the edge of my computer so that the palm case could hang over the edge."
4,Protects from wear and tear!,"I purchased a Palm Vx off the internet and wanted to protect it because I use it outdoors year round. I got the metallic blue cover and it was shipped without additional shipping charges (thank you!). I really like it, but have made several observations: 1) need to open front and back and have it hang over the end of my desk for hot synch (not a big deal), 2) the cover does not close completely when laying on desk (again not a big deal, probably needs a stonger spring). I like the fact that it is light (a plus for plastic) and I like the fact that it is durable (I work outdoors and have dropped it several times). I think anyone who works outdoors or in manufacturing will need protection such as this case... It is light, hard, and not real expensive.... a great buy."
2,Not for the Left handed,"The one that I have is the normal anodized aluminum, not the blue but I assume they are the same. I would love my case and give it five stars if only you could attached it on the right side so it opens up the opposite way. I am a lefty and it would be nice if someone thought of us for a change. Making the case reversible would be easy enough. If you try to reverse it, the cover does not close all the way."
2,"Sturdy Case, But Left a Mark...","I have used the case on my Palm for some time and while I agree that it is very sturdy and can save your Palm from accidental bumps, I have found that it has left a rubbing mark against the right side of my Palm V.The mark goes down along the metal on the front of the Palm between the edge of the screen and the right side of the Palm.A little point, perhaps, but since the purpose of having a case like this is to protect your Palm, then it is disappointing that it leaves its own mark there instead."
2,"Nice looking, but troublesome","This is not for the Metallic Blue color one, but I'm assuming it's the same thing as the normal anodized aluminum, which is the one that I have. The problem with this case is that it always turns on the contrast button on the top left or the power button on the top right. It's really bothersome when your using your palm and all of a sudden the backlight goes on, the ajust contrast goes on, the palm shuts off or turns on with the case closed. Usually when I open my case I'm not surprised that the palm is on and has the adjust contrast on too."
1,disappointed,Could not get it to hold the Palm Pilot I had recently purchased fromAmazon. Worked for hours and it would not close all the way. Very disapointed so sent it back. The refund was just a few pennies. NOT HAPPY.
4,Good protection,"I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far. Why 4 stars? One of the things that I still worry though, despite 5 months of non-problem use, is that it opens really easily. I just dread the day when the case will open and all the junk that is in my bag will scratch/soil/destruct my Palm Pilot. The case also leaves one side of the handheld exposed, letting dust, small pieces of paper, etc, get in it. Finally, getting the Palm Pilot out of the case is challenging and requires getting used to.Given how well the Palm Pilot has served me, I am currently looking for another case that will keep the gadget really safe."
5,Excellent!,"I purchased the Palm V hard case in order to protect my palm without being unnecesarily bulky. It fits the job well. As has been noticed with other people, the case is in fact plastic with aluminum pieces glued on, but it's ok. The protection is very good and the aluminum pieces don't detract from it. Also, it looks much better in person than the photo. The photo looks sort of aqua-ish from here, in person it's more like a navy blue. I haven't dropped my palm yet, but I expect the case to handle it very well if I do."
4,I LOVE IT,"I find this cookbook to be wonderfully readable, whether for cooking or for curling up by the fireplace to read on a Sunday afternoon. I am not a very experienced French cook, I am just learning. However, I visited France for a period of time, staying with a French family. I find the recipes here to be much the same as the home cooking I recieved while in France. It may not be fancy Parisian fare with elaborate sauces, but it is not intended to be that. It seems to be written as a book for French (Brittany to be specific) country home cooking. True French cusine focuses on the freshest local ingrediants available, beautifully prepared, and that is just what is in this book."
4,French Style Cooking For Everyday,"Cooking With the Seasons is an excellent book filled with delicious recipes as well as snippets of the author's memories of growing up in France. The variations listed at the end of most recipes give the everyday cook the opportunity to adapt to what is on hand. Monique's tips, which are scattered throughout the book, are useful bits of information to aid the cook with common delimmas.I was disappointed to learn that the recipes had already been adapted to what is available in America. This is useful to those who live in the US, but to those of us anticipating a move to France or those who wish to create a truly authentic French dish, it is less than ideal.Nevertheless, it is a beautifully done book with wonderful recipes, delightful memories, and great tips. It is a book that deserves a place of honor in any cook's kitchen."
5,EDDIE CREATED ANOTHER HIT!,Well kidz this track if FIERCE....a must have for the other fellow deejays out there...and just for people as well. I assure you that you will love this trax. I know I do.
5,"Comparing 2 wacom Intuos3 6X8 tablets PTZ630, PTZ630AC","Comparing 2 wacom Intuos3 6X8 tabletsMy daughter and I were searching for the best tablet for graphic art. The wacom Intuo3 6X8 has the highest recommendation. There are two versions. It was hard to find the difference in the two. They both have limited lifetime warranty. We chose the this product; the PTZ630 because we did notice a huge difference in the software bundled they come with.Intuos3 PTZ630: Software Included - Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 Corel Painter Essentials 2 nik Color Efex Pro 2 IE from nik multimedia & Wacom Brushes 2.0Wacom Brushes 2.0 for Photoshop(newer?)Intuos3 PTZ630AC: Software Included - Drivers & Utilities, Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0"
5,Everything they say it is,"I ordered this as my first pen/tablet combo. I have so far used it exclusively for Photoshop, but it is a dream. I have sometimes wrist pain with using the mouse too long, but not with the pen. It does take some getting used to, but once you do the interface is flawless. No complaints yet!"
4,Wacom Intuos3,Quality of product and functionality is great. The use is much more difficult than I had anticipated. But like all good things I am sure that in time I will become proficient with the item. Much greater flexibility and accuracy than the mouse alone. Down side is that it is taking longer due to my learning curve.
5,High-end performance product!,"I am primarily a painter, hoping to get into the digital aspect of illustration. I guess I may not be well-qualified to write a review of this item, as it is my first digital tablet. But I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. It was a bit spendy, even discounted, but now that I have one, I would definitely say it was well worth the price. I don't know how I ever got along without one.I was worried that 6x8 would be a bit small, but it seems more than adequate for my needs so far. The Intuos 3 tablet is pressure-sensitive, measures the angle of your stylus to the surface, and includes the function buttons, scroll strip, and a mouse. My only disappointment is that there isn't an 'undo' button on the tablet for use with Corel Painter. Otherwise, aside from using 'Ctrl+Z', I would never have to use the keyboard.I'm still psyched about this product. This is a great tablet for design students and illustrators!"
4,WOW! Cant wait to get it!,"I already own the Intuos2 4x5 tablet and have had it for over 2 years, but need something bigger. I can say that without a doubt, Wacom tablets are the best out there. The one I own has NEVER failed me. It fits great in my laptop bag too.If you are thinking about another brand, don't bother, you'll be greatly disappointed. I'm buying my Intos3 6x8 right now... so should you!"
2,Is good but not that good.,"After using this tablet about 4 months now I had experimented with all of its functions but still not satisfy me because I tough that this tablet will show what you draw on it, this is not posible because in what you draw is a solid grey color plastic cover that feels the magnetic point of the pen and then projects the image on the computer screen. I'm disappointed because I paid to much money for what is not a valuable product at all. You can buy it but I do not recomend it for serious animators or serios artist who want to see what they are drawing on the tablet surface."
5,Gifted a tablet & off I go!,"I had the good fortune to be gifted with this particular version of the WACOM tablet and I adore it! I am not a graphic designer, but I enjoy creating digital art as a hobby, and I was a bit too intimidated to purchase a tablet for that reason. The size is perfect for my needs, and I have not experienced any of the problems mentioned in other reviews. I still use my good old XP SP3 version on my PC and the tablet worked smoothly & efficiently. Even nicer is the fact I can use a real signature on my artwork rather than a digital signature. I am an artist rather than a person who is well versed with computer toys and I found it easy to use (and figure out, since instructions are sparse). I have also enjoyed the accompanying software which interfaces nicely with my PSP X4 and other art programs. While I didn't have to pay for the tablet since it was a gift, I would certainly purchase one now with no regrets."
3,Waiting to see the difference,"I used the small Wacom Graphire tablet for several years and was very pleased with it. I do a lot of work in Photoshop and can't imagine ever doing without a tablet. Being left handed also helps since I keep the tablet to the left of the keyboard and my regular Microsoft Mouse to the right of the keyboard (I don't care for the Wacom mouse.)After reading the virtues of its big brother the Intuos3, I broke down and bought it. It's a good deal larger than my old tablet and takes up a bit more room than I'd like. I'm getting used to it but frankly at this point (about a month into using it)I am having difficulty seeing a major functional difference between the little Graphire and this one. Perhaps it's just something that I will learn to love over time. But right now I must say that I could have found better things to spend my $$$ on."
4,First time tablet experience,"Although I have little experience with other tablet products on the market, I find this product to work great. I have no trouble with memory, application conflicts or the like. It makes working with Illustrator and Photoshop exponentially easier and I look forward to lots of use."
5,Could NOT live without it. (Zero complaints!),"As a pro photographer, this is the one thing I absolutely could not live without in the editing process. Got this tool about three months ago, and the time savings alone from chaning the brush size is HUGE!If you do lots of work in photoshop, save your pennies and buy this as fast as you can. I promise you will not regret it!"
5,Simply Amazing,This is the best tablet I have ever used!!! Absolutely stunning product. You will not be disappointed. This is also the best price I have seen it for!!
4,A must if you love to draw or have tiny objects to remove,The Wacom Tablet has always been a mainstay of my work as an artist using Photoshop. I love to draw and often have to modify very small areas of my digital work. I just purchased a new Wacom up-to-date tablet and everything works beautifully except for one thing. Although I assume I have set the pen up to make a varied width line it does not do it on the tablet. I get a line that is all one width. This was also true on my last Wacom Tablet. This hopefully is something I am doing wrong and not the fault of the tablet.
5,Great tablet!,I've had my tablet for a few weeks now and it's great! I do have to say it's my first I've ever had but I heard so many good things about it I decided to buy it. Worth the money if you do a lot of computer art and design :)
5,Perfect for anyone who draws!,"Great Item, great deal at $269.99. Perfect for drawing easy to setup and get started. Had no problems with Vista and the hot keys make using photoshop a lot easier.Only suggestion would be to order more pen tips ahead of time. They give you 3 of the regular ones, but there is a felt type pen tip that feels more like a real pencil. MAKE SURE TO ORDER DIRECTLY FROM WACOM, the pen tips are a lot cheaper."
5,No Problems,"Works like a charm, but I think if I had it to do over again, I might get the larger size. This is one of those things where bigger might be better."
5,Can't live without this,"I bought this a few years ago after getting into drawing more and more, and I absolutely fell in love with this thing! I consider this one of the things I can no longer live without. If it broke I would buy a new one immediately. I feel so creative and there are so many possibilities with this (and the software I've got), that the sky is the limit. It comes bundled with a version of Photoshop Elements (which is very good) and Corel Painter Essentials. I didn't use that program as much, but if you are into real media artwork, then definitely it's a great software.I really only had one small complaint with this and I recently found a way to fix it, so I can't really complain now. But sometimes when I was drawing, I would bump the little button thing on the side of the pen, causing it to open a menu, but I found out how to disable that button now, so it's all good.If you are in doubt as to whether to buy one of these, don't be. Get it. I can't imagine you'll be sorry."
1,bad mouse,"After very little usage, the mouse died. Wacom said I had to buy a new one for $70 plus tax and shipping. The stylus and tablet are still OK; but this mouse is expensive garbage."
5,wacom pen tablet,I'm hapy with this tablet is more realiable and control responded than those other brand .very lick design and feel like pro when I using the table a little expense thothg but is worth it.still learning to used and what surprice me more is that work exellent on corel suite 11 and 12 and and old photoshop program. recomended if you can affor it .
5,perfect graphic tablet,"I love this tablet. It is the perfect size for everyday use and travel. I also like that you can program the buttons to eliminate keyboard shortcuts.It is the perfect fit for Corel Painter and the sensitivity is great. The pen has a great feel, with extra nibs. I prefer the one with the spring. It has a long cord (wish it were wireless). Once you get use to the pen you will never use a mouse again. There is no wrist strain and my hand never falls alseep or gets tired when using the pen. I am considering getting the smallest tablet to use like a mouse pad when I'm not drawing or painting to use to completely eliminate my mouse altogether."
5,Graphic Pen vs. Mouse,"Wow. No comparison with the mouse when working in photoshop. I bought the 6x8 tablet for illustrator, but now I don't know how I got along without it for all those years in photoshop!? I like switching back and forth between the pen and the mouse, depending on the project. The installation on the mac was very easy. No problems."
4,Another fun read,"I had the pleasure of hearing Julia Mandala read ""Redneck Wizard,"" the first story in this collection. It's sort of a backwoods Bubba in King Arthur's court, and it was another pleasure to read the story here. On first hearing, the story was entirely too good not to want to have a copy to keep.""Worse"" is an amusing little story about an elf prince who's supposed to marry a foreign princess and, after meeting her, would rather eat dirt -- not a normal part of the elvish diet.The piece de resistance is ""Dracula's Lawyer,"" the title story, in which a lawyer is hired by the legendary Carpathian prince to bring suit against a town for not hiring him as an accountant. Since he can't expose himself to sunlight to apply or to work during daylight hours, he's using the Americans With Disabilities Act to fight for the job.Ms. Mandala has a knack of creating characters one immediately cares about and her style is clean and witty. While not heavyweights, these stories are a pleasure to read."
4,And the plot thickens...,"A Distant Soil is the tale of Liana Scott, a young girl who is heir to the collected psionic powers of an alien race. She allies herself with a rebel faction and, with the aid of a ragtag band of humans (ranging from a Jersey cop to the legendary Sir Galahad), she prepares to help lead a revolution.Ms. Doran weaves a story of psionic battles and political intrigue, all rendered in her sumptuous illustrations. A Distant Soil is probably best known for its art, a stand alone in the world of comic books. Her drawings contain a realism rarely seen in comic books, a realism that is propelled into the fantastic by the gorgeous cosume designs and extravegant sets.The villians are horribly evil and sometimes the story becomes a bit of a space opera, but the character of Liana helps to ground the tale and makes it engaging from start to finish."
3,One or two are playable,"If you could get it for under $[...] no shipping think about it. My suggestions is research gameplay on utube or something and just know its outdated. It cant hold a candle to Disciples, Diablo, Heroes or Warlords chains. I would rate this pack a 5/10 where the Disciples, Diablo and Warlords would get 9/10 ratings. It did play on windows Vista FYI."
3,Flawed but worthwhile portrait of a society in change,"Interesting and informative, if not deeply emotionally gripping. Aportrait of the rise of local thuggish Islamic fundamentalists inAlgeria, and their conflict with a moderate baker who steals theirblaring speaker so he can sleep.With a few exceptions the characters aren't very deep and are confinedto archetypes, although the ending twist is interesting. That said,this grew on me a bit on a 2nd viewing. While the acting still oftenseemed amateurish, there was more emotion, and more a sense of a filmwith historical import; an attempt to capture and understand a momentin time when everything in a society is changing."
5,very well-written book,"Its a shame that its out of print , and a shame for his other books, too... He combines real facts and historical events with a love story and I find that very interesting and educational at the same time... I enjoyed this thoroughly and also ""The Woman of Cairo"" was excellent..."
3,Paris Poster,"This poster was a little smaller than I expected, but I found a spot for it in my apt. It's not as detailed as I'd hoped, but it's still a beautiful capture of the city of lights."
5,Lush interpretation,"Mr. Polyansky provides a beautiful, lush interpretation of Rachmaninoff's second symphony. The strings are well balanced against the horns, the tempos are appropriate, never rushed for drama or restrained to the point of boredom. And the Russian State Symphonic Cappella choir is, as usual, outstanding."
4,"Brulée vive, excellent livre","Tres bon livre, plein de vérité qu`on ne connaissait pas! J`ai pleurer, j`ai jurer contre ces hommes, mais j`ai adorer. Malgré une maniere d`écrire qui passe du coq a l`ane, le livre est tres bon! Vous ne faite pas erreur en l`achetant."
2,didnt work for me,i got this to help with my migraines and it made them worse. it wasnt this product it was ANY magnesium.
5,Quintessential Street Musician,"I'm sorry that I never got to hear Danny Barker sing other than through this CD. It's a good thing that this CD is not too difficult to find - You'll find it here in New Orleans, if not elsewhere. Or listen to WWOZ, they play ""Save The Bones"" and ""Ham and Eggs"" fairly fequently. Danny sings with such a sense of loose fun that you can't help but get wrapped up in his simple songs. This CD gives the feeling that you are walking up Decatur and happen along Danny busking in the sun, the Mississippi barges floating in the background. I would have dropped some money in his guitar case."
1,Good Story Ruined by Bad English (Kindle Edition),"I am an amateur military historian residing in Japan. My interest has always been WWII Pacific so am reading as many books as I can on both Japanese and American experiences. I was particularly interested in accounts of the B-29 bombing campaign against Japan. I was looking forward to reading an account of both a mission and subsequent incarceration as a POW. I was bitterly disappointed, however, as the grotesquely poor English (spelling and grammar) made the book unreadable for me. I am by no means a stickler but the faults were so bad I had to put it down. Too bad, as I'm sure it is an account that should be read. I just could not wade through the errors."
5,Liam at his best,"This cd is worth the cost just for Pandemonium (trust me I own every Prodigy cd), it is the best Rave style song that Liam has made. I don't know why he didn't include it on the album. The first and second edits of Fire are good too, but do not compare to Pandemonium. If you like The Prodigy Experience you'll like this one."
4,Prodigy Pandemonium,This is a good EP with the last song being the best. I've collected most of their material as far as I know and like 90% of it. The Prodigy is an excellent group and look forward to their new album coming out this month.
5,Fantastic timing and well worth the cost,Arrived days before expected and was surprised to see the great quality for the price paid. My Step Son loves it.
4,True story of child abuse,"Cliff tells of the totally inconsistant upbringing that happens when both parents and grandparents are alcoholics. Although they complete for his loyalty, they fail to see that the boy has food, clothes, or stability. Unlike A Child Called It, there is no evil adult, just sadly flawed, selfish creatures of habit. The fact that the author becomes a responsible adult, good father, and responsible citizen makes this a must read for kids who fear their own lives are blighted."
5,You'll feel the river between your toes,"Cliff's wonderful account of his less than wonderful childhood bears witness to the greatness of his spirit and the excellence of his story telling ability. You will be there with him in the dark swirling waters as he struggles to escape from the grip of he-who-would-drown-him. You will be there while he smears cooling mud on his naked five year old body and rings the doorbell proudly to share his work of art.....It is a book of delight and philosophy and humor and humanity. Uplifting, hopeful, happy, sad. Strongly recommended."
5,Wrong Side of the River,"This book is inspirational to anyone who has gone through adversity! It goes to show a person that even if you are not given a good start to life that you can change the outcome by making better decisions! This is a must read for everyone whether you had a great childhood or not! For the people in Filer, Idaho or surrounding cities you will not believe that Cliff Johnson lead that kind of life when he was younger. Please consider giving this to a troubled youth; it can change their perspective. Hope you enjoy this wonderful book as much as I did!"
4,Roy Orbison,"I love Roy Orbison's music, and to have 50 of hia songs is a real treat. CD arrived in timely manner and was in good condition."
3,A very personal account of this great lady of God,"Not a very deep book about the spiritual life of this woman of God, but it does contain many interesting and unusual stories about her that the other biographies do not contain. A very insightful look into this lady's life from an obviously close and dear friend."
1,I Can't Put This Book Down!,"I've been reading ""Death & Deliverance: Haunting True Story of the Hercules Crash at the North Pole"" by Robert Mason Lee.From the instant I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down.Literally, I am physically unable to release it from my grasp!I am posting this comment through the use of voice recognition software, because my hands are permanently affixed.Without an image of this book in the advertisement, I assumed it was like a normal book - not covered with razor-sharp hollow hooks that inject surgical adhesive under my skin, and cruel barbs that pierce my palms and leave me in searing agony.I can't dial the phone or put the key in my ignition, and I am dozens of miles from help.It is as if I am trapped in a wrecked Hercules airplane at the North Pole.Great story so far, by the way..."
4,WORK OK,"TRIED TO KEEP THE TWISTING OUT OF MY OXYGEN TUBING, THESE HELP, BUT DO NOT CURE THE PROBLEM, i LIKE THEM"
5,Mercenaries 5 stars,"Mercenaries was by far my favorite impulse d20 buy ever. It has lots of great supplement. It has 9 new races, 10 new classes, a great equipment section, new spells, two chapters on mercenaries as pcs, npcs, and random mercenarie campaign themes. My favorite classes in this book are the Nomad class, which is mostly about skills and learning languages, and the Mercenary ranger. The merc ranger really isnt very differnt than the D&d ranger. The big differance is in the ranger options. Rather than the ranger options being in one specific order you choose what you want to specialize in. So rather than start off with the choice of a combat style at second level you get a ranger option. theirs a list of all sorts of things that you can do in stead. for example you can take spell casting rather than combat style. This book is loaded with supplement and is worth buying."
4,Simple but Thorough,"This book is simple but very effective. The examples given help to provide understanding. I would recommend it as a reference to keep at the office. Most of the concepts overlap with the same I have found in other similar books but this is easier to read and understand without a lot of extra ""fluff"". The price is steep though."
3,Much better as I got older,"I received this DVD recently and as I watched both movies, they were much better now than I watched them back in the day. I guess now as I am older, I understand the storylines. Back then, I just watched the movie to see crazy cops. Part 2 was better now, because I thought it was a huge dropoff from part 1. Part 2 isn't bad, I love that fat sloppy guy who played Mohoney's partner, the guy who got his hands stuck to his hair in the showers, and the Howard Hessman character who got spray painted. Part 3 to me is the prime of the characters. The crew really gets into gear here. But, as a treat, you get two decent movies for the price of 1, you can't go wrong!"
5,Classic Study of Feminism and Revolution,"I found this book to be an excellent study of the promise and failure of revolutions, specifically communist revolutions, to enact feminst reform. I use this book when teaching courses, and it is well received. The points may be basic, but they are well documented and illustrated with a good case study. Highly recommended."
3,Adequate but not exciting,"Kay Ann Johnson's book deals with how the Chinese Communist Party dealt with women's issues, especially marriage reform. The history of the CCP and feminism is rather complex and fluctuates rapidly, making for an interesting historical situation. Johnson's presentation is easy to read but not particularly engaging, and seems even a bit simplistic. Still, a good introduction to women in communist China."
4,chucka_6,"Seems to be well made. It was a good value for the money. Other than that, I cannot say much more than it is a sensor that I needed."
5,Plugged and screwed right in,"This Motorcraft SW-6350 kit is the replacement for the recalled cruise control. It's a 5 minute job to replace the screw-in fitting, and the mini-harness plugs right in. Good price. ('95 Ford F-350)"
4,Milky's single is the best piece of Italo NRG pop,"This is the third I think single from Milky. The first was (back in 2002) Just The Way You Are with different girl in the video but the same voice LOL. The second - pretty infectious In My Mind.And the third is this. By the way, the first time I heard it, that was Italian version and I like it a lot. And it was mmmmm somewhere in summer of 2003. Then this song was all over radio in English in 2004. And from all her 3 singles this one is the best! Pure Italo dance, a piece of Euro dance - name it how you want. And it sounds fresh and nice today too."
3,VAST improvement over the first song...,"Milky's first single was so nursery rhyme sing-song it drove me nuts. This track is much more sophisticated yet still offers a catchy 'na na' line, and while the mixes are very similar, they are all good in their own right. Aside from the fact that it just doesn't have enough vocal, my favorite is the JJ Flores dub, which is very driving, and reminds me of somthing Robbie Rivera might do."
4,Falco-Junge Roemer,"I have really enjoyed my recent purchase from Amazon. I have been a big fan of Falco, and have probably gotten to become a bigger fan since his death 10 years ago. This CD has become a great asset to my Falco collection. Thanks for keeping his memory and music alive!"
1,The Inventor of Modern Nursing??,"What manure! Nightingale invented the concept of ""nursing,"" modern and otherwise. Seacole merely continued the tradition of herbal and folk medicine as practiced by village midwives and grandmothers, hoping for Nightingale's recognition but never receiving it. She was not a nurse, nor an originator of nursing practice, by any means."
1,Would give zero if they had it,"This cd is such a piece of junk, totally canned percussion it sounds like a casio keyboard produced it. Its a shame this guy had to pay off so many people in the record business to be reviewed.stay away it is more advantageous to buy one and break it than to listen to it"
5,Delivers what is says on the box,Takes you right from the basics to complex stuff like QR decomposition and SVD. Very useful for programmers who want to gain knowledge on solving linear equations.
1,JUNK,This battery does not hold a charge for more than a day. Don't waste your money. Sorry I sent it to friend. Buy a Duracell.

3,Not bad,"I give this book a borderline 3 - 4 stars. It isn't bad - it explored all of the Kennedy men adequately but none very extensively. Leamer does do a great job of explaining the relationships among the Kennedy men, especially the complicated relationship that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. had with all of his children.The author offers up stunning and excruciating details about Joe Kennedy Jr's. death, as well as Kathleen's death. These instances were painful to read, but very insightful about the patriarch's emotions.I feel Leamer did concentrate a bit too much on JFK's sexual trysts, but that is a topic that no book on the Kennedys will neglect, so it's not really a complaint.It would have been nice had the book ended in 1968 and not 1963. Another 100 pages would have given the reader much more great reading on RFK following the president's death and also his run for the presidency in 1968.All in all, this is a good book for diehard Kennedy aficionados."
4,Leamer Tells It Like It Is...and Was,"This is one of the best books ever written about the Kennedys. From the first chapter about young Joe Kennedy, this book will seize your imagination and bring to life all of the tragedy and glory of being a Kennedy. Read it for sure!"
4,Interesting history.,"Interesting history by an author whose analysis is undermined by his liberal bias. He does not shrink from JFK or the family's shorthcomings, but fails in my estimation to accurately analyze central issues facing JFK during his administration. Very readable with some new information."
4,Worth The Ten-Cent Used Book Price? Yes!,"One of the best books about the Kennedys, The Kennedy Men is deficient in only two ways: inelegant repetition of words and descriptive terms, sometimes within the same sentence, inept picture captions; and the author's flabby adherence to the media-celebrated Oswald-alone notion of JFK's death. Its strengths are many: a bold writing style, a truly impressive handling of what must have been a huge mass of unwieldy source material, a fair rendering of the complex character of Joe Kennedy, Senior; and a skillful recreation of contrasting moods and settings--pol-mad Old Boston, prep-school football afternoons, dread Ex-Com meetings, breezy days on the Cape."
2,What's so good about this book or author?,"The inside jacket preview and the back cover reviews seem to be by those who could not have read this book.The author may be accomplished, but I am not impressed. In this book, it all comes back to whether or not the Kennedy he's wirting about at the time is having sex and with whom, not with the historic topic at hand.I also feel some of the most important facts are either misinterpreted, left out or just wrong.I am not impressed."
2,not very good,"I've read 64 biographys and it's one of the worse.There are a few photos.some informations are odd, because the author invents them.buy not this book, but buy better book like a common good, the thirteen days, the kennedys and the fitzgerald, robert kennedy and his time..."
3,An odd mix of piercing humor and pain,"A really strange book, uncomfortable at times - more of a 2.5 for me than a 3, but it's going to vary a lot for other readers depending on personal tastes.The protagonist is an extremely smart young woman in NYC who has both a compelling need to verbally/mentally skewer everyone and everything around her yet clings desperately to the resulting shards of shattered friendship and love affairs. If you can ignore the painful arc of self-sabotage through the story, Harriet's piercing descriptions of all she encounters hit the simultaneous tones of truth, mean-spiritedness, and hilarity.If it sounds as if this review is all over the place, trust me, this book is all over the map. Even though I didn't really enjoy it that much, at the end, I had to wonder: what has Harriet gotten herself into now...But if you like this kind of thing, this is the kind of thing you'll like. Try the Kindle sample on your PC or other device for a taste test."
2,Very little cream center,There were two eye-sized dollops of cream in the center when cut so there was a lot of cake that was dry and wihout anything to make it heavenly. Very disappointing and nothing like the picture. Was given this as a gift. Would not recommend.
1,The rose glows,"I received the rose, but was hoping for the moon. Mine does not change color, but I do like the light which is more of a blue-white ""glow"" around the edge and thru the etched rose design. It doesn't bother me that I can't turn it off & on since I'd prefer not having to remember to do that and I like not seeing a bulb. Simple and attractive."
1,"Night Light, Rose or Moon: Misleading","The Two lights are As different as they can possibly be.1) The ""Rose"" lamp changes colors via a multi colored LED that cycles automatically between Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and all the possible color combinations these colors generate... Excellent for teaching a small child his colors with some excitement!2) The ""Moon""lamp is simply a White LED that's constant...This is NOT borne out in the product descriptions causing one to think that since they ship them indiscriminately/mixed they must be similar.... Beware!!!!! I was greatly disappointed... My entire shipment was of the ""Moon"" design!"
2,Not worth the money,"This light is OK, but it's on all the time. There's no sensor to make it shut off when there is light in the room. I have other nightlights like this one, but they turn off and they can change to different colors. And I'm pretty sure I paid less for those."
3,"Nice light, but not very bright","This night light is not very bright. I purchased it with the intention of using it in the bathroom for night time lighting, but it was not bright enough to be used in that area. Instead I had to use it as an extra night light in the kids bedroom. So if you need a shallow, nice looking light, but don't need the light to be bright, then this will work ok, otherwise look for another model."
2,"Pretty, but not much light","The design is very pretty, but it doesn't put much light in the room. Also stays on all the time, so you have have to unplug it to turn it off."
2,Incomplete description,"I think it would have been better for them to tell that the ""moon"" design does not change colors like the Rose design. I also think you should be able to pick which you would rather have. I inherited a rose and ordered 2 more lights, but was disappointed that I got the Moon and it did not change colors!"
3,Night light doesn't turn off during the day time,"I received the moon design. The carved art is nice and the light is blue white in color (only one color). It is a good size, ~4.5"" in height, ~2"" wide and ~1.5"" in depth.I bought this nightlight thinking it has auto photo sensor which turn off the light when the room is bright. That is why is called a 'night' light, it turns on when is dark. Unfortunately, the light stays on all the day. Though is not going to cost a lot to run it 24hrs a day/7 days a week/365 days a year, but it will wear down the bulb's life. I wished it would mention on the description, ""light doesn't turn off"". I hopee this will help future buyers."
1,Disappointing,"This story starts out well with a mildly intriguing mystery and a promising setting. Sadly it falls into predicable patterns with the murderer so obvious I had to force myself to finish the novel. Orchids can be fascinating, but here they were used as a premise for mapping out events and their appearances began to read like directions. And to be honest, a few sentences were written so badly my jaw dropped. Skip it. Read Minette Walters, Tony Hillerman or Steig Larsson so you won't feel like you lost time you'll never get back."
5,It was excellent !,"Katie O' Roark is having some heart problems. She needs a new heart, but where would she find it? In the mean time a guy's brother died suddenly, and Katie can finally gets a new heart and can have a new life, and go back to the track team to run again. She wasn't allowed to go run yet,but she's desprate. There is an Olympics thing for people who have problems. Is Katie that desprate she would take a chance? Would something happen to her? Would her ""second life"" end quickly? I just loved the book. It was hard to put it down. To find out about what happened to Katie read the book Someone Lives Someone Dies."
4,Someone Dies Someone lives a heart warming story,"Someone Dies, Someone lives, Is a great book it kept me hooked on to each word till the end of the last page. Its weird how a death can make a huge impact on two people. Aaron's death might have been good for both Katie for keeping her alive with his heart and heart breaking for Josh for loosing his only brother who got him as far as he is in life. This book is a type of book that will keep you guessing till the end."
5,Medieval Gift Economy,"Includes an excellent section on the medieval gift economy, something which many authors have relegated to anthropology of the developing world. He is one of the few to show the pattern of looting and giving--to knights, to God, to King--that solidified social relations and acted as the road to power in the old social order."
3,"ok, but should be re-titled","I bought this DVD because it was advertised as featuring Lenny Bruce and Jonathan Winters. The entire Bruce segment is about 60 seconds, and is lifted from the early 60s show that is available in its entirety elsewhere. The clip is too short, out of context, and definitely not representative of his material....certainly not a good reason to put his name on this DVD.The Jonathan Winters segment is at the very end, and he's in great form, although the clip is also short; maybe a few minutes. The Jackie Vernon clip is also entertaining.The DVD has lots of Mort Sahl footage, discussion about Mort Sahl, and a bonus clip of Mort Sahl. This DVD would have been better named ""Mort Sahl and the Hungry I"". If you like old folk songs and Mort Sahl, you'll like this. For fans of Enrico, this is a good chance to see him talking alot about the club and era.For Lenny Bruce fans, get the ""Lenny Bruce Performance Film"" instead."
3,Some History,"That is what it is, just a tiny fraction of it's reality. Oh well. You had to had been there."
5,Expand you Spanish,A collection of short stories that can be read in an afternoon by an intermidiate or advanced student. Nice cross section of stories from the Spanish world.
2,Small and self-absorbed,"I opened this book with great anticipation, thinking it would evoke California's San Joaquin Valley, its landscape, people, challenges and changes. Instead Varni has written a small, self-absorbed account, which appears to be largely autobiographical, of his unhappy dysfunctional family. Unhappy families can be the stuff of great literature but nothing in the telling here gives the book wings; humdrum, often cruelly-rendered details collect on every page, leaden and inert. Varni's bitterness is occasionally redeemed by patches of attractive writing, but the overall effect is that of being forced to listen to someone in a smelly bar pour out their sad tales of mom and dad. One can't wait for it to end."
2,"definately had potential, but....","I was so disapointed with this novel. Varni clearly has a love of words and language and there are times when this shines, particulary in part one. But in regard to story structure, the work is lacking. The characters had my interest initially but it never paid off and by the last 80 pages I was trudging through just simply to say I'd finished. The main character and narrator, Vincent, struck me as brooding and self-absorbed. Wanting to transplant himself but continually coming back to his roots simply so he could have a dysfunctional family to blame for his own hum-drum existence. Nothing new there. If you value your reading time, take a pass until the author (or his editor) have more experience and/or a story to tell."
2,Don't bother reading,"narcissistic, non educating, navel gazing at it's worst. This fellow blames everyone but himself for his failure to attach any importance to life and relationships.Not worth the time spent reading."
2,junk,"This is a very poor compliation of instructions. You will not gain any insite into the real world of urban survival. Pure junk, would send it back if I could"
2,Not as good as i had hoped,"While there is good information in here on surviving disasters in an urban environment, there is no mistaking the disdain that the author holds for the cities and the people who live there."
4,Taking care of basic human needs,"I love Tom Brown's approach to survival: it's just a real practical, methodical look at basic human needs. Tom doesn't get excited. He just knows a lot of stuff that you should know that he's willing to share. He takes all his tracking and survival skills from the woods and turns them into street smarts for you and me. I may never build a snare trap in the city, but I'm glad to know ten ways to keep warm, six ways to build a shelter and three ways to distill questionable drinking water.There are chapters on food, water, light, crime, weather and disasters. I keep this book in my ""To-Go"" bag.Nancy Overton is the author of ""A Checklist/ Making a Family Plan for Emergencies""."
2,"Poorly organized, not very useful","This book rambles quite a bit and provides a wealth not very targeted information. Do I really need to know how the rain cycle works to survive in the suburbs? Or how a generator works (without instructions on how to build my own out of scraps)?In all, the useful information in this book would fill a smallish pamphlet. The rest is filler.A great disappointment."
3,Something nice for the true fan,"This would be a good buy if you have most of the singles and don't have Campfire Songs. If you have the Campfire compilation, then you've already got what's here."
2,Need the internet,I bought this for my parents who love to play card games on the computer but are not real computer savvy. Unfortunately the 1100 games are really just a handful of games that you can play before you have to log onto the internet and pay for ones you like. This was more like a sampler package. Nowhere on the package did it say it was web-based... unless you looked at the teeny tiny 'requirements' section and saw it said browser.
3,Card games 1100,"I purchased Card Games 1100 for my husband, he especially wanted to play cribbage on his laptop. We are disappointed in the fact that he has to insert the disc each time he wants to play a card game. It does not download completely. Otherwise the games are great, easy to use."
3,Galaxy Cards,"The games are fun. Helps eliminate boredom, which is always a plus in my book. It's a bit old school, but it'll do."
4,Sick!,i bought this china cymbal about a week ago and i thought it was going to be a piece of garbage for $15..but i just got in the mail and it's a killer deal and it sounds good!!!
5,Great!,"This cymbal has a great sound to it and is well built. It was a great buy and just the sound I needed. It holds up great, just like any other cymbal as long as you don't absolutely crush it. My band wanted me to get one and it was the best choice I've made in a while. I mean for 30 bucks, to get a great sound like this. This is a no brainer."
5,Hands down best budget brand,"Ive heard accounts of inconsistancys when it comes to the durability of Wuhan Chinas, but I've been wailing on this thing for a few weeks now and its fully capabile of my beatings. Wuhan creates a really trashy, nasty sounding china. This is a good thing for me (I play Metalcore, Deathcore, Death-metal, ect) and i wouldnt have it any other way. For $30 i will definatly buy again if it breaks. Go ahead and shell out the cash for a big 4 brand if you like, but just know that Wuhan will always have a great china with a great neck-breaking tone."
2,Alright,"For this price, I couldn't expect anything better. I am not a huge fan of the china sound in general and this one is particularly ugly. Depending on the style of playing, it could fit in really well, but I don't play anything that requires a lot/any china at all, just wanted to experiment with the sound. I would recommend getting a better quality china if you were serious about incorporating this type of sound into your playing."
3,Unique sound.,"Like any instrument, you need to hear it before buying and/or hear how it fits with your other cymbals/percussion instruments. Each cymbal has unique chararistics/overtones, etc.As for a generic review, very china-like sounding (or at least the one I received.)"
2,Slow and pointless,I found this book WAY to long and dull beyond my words to convey. It's so drawn out and slow. Finally after about 200 pages it becomes a little intresting when they start the near death experiments. You wonder what's at the end of the tunnel. When I found out it was the Titanic my recation was; is that it? Then there is about 400 odd pages to wade though of the same things over and over and over again until you reach the end. The end was the worst thing about the whole book and left me feeling that I had really wasted my time actually getting though this boring book to get to THIS?
2,Connie Willis NOT at her best,"Like on Dish Night, there should be no Titanic on this book.Connie Willis has some great books. This is not one of them. Rambling, repetitious and boring, it is short on plot and character and long on clichés and metaphors. Oh, yes, the metaphors. They are everywhere and just when you think you got away, she slams you on the head with another one.It would take a very patient editor to save this book by cutting out all the unnecessary pages, chop off the excessive metaphors, burn the clichés and flesh out the characters."
4,Not sure I've finished reading . . .,"I may still be on the ship or in the hospital: I know I have to read this again, to see if it's as complex as I think. The parallels between the ship and the hospital, Maisie's disasters and Mr. Briarley's memories, seem to me to be very tricky footwork. I was occasionally surprised by cliches in style or in characterization, but I didn't much care. I was too fully engaged. Maybe the next time around I'll give it five stars. I'm sending copies to a friend and my daughter-in-law for their birthdays."
2,Read 'Bellweather' first,"I have been a fan of Connie Willis for quite some time and I highly recommend her earlier time travel novels, 'The Doomsday Book', and 'To Say Nothing Of The Dog' and her very humorous short novel about fads and trends entitled 'Bellweather'. Her more recent book, 'Passage' concerns near-death experiences. It has the same humorous tone as the earlier novels but I found the novel disturbing and felt unsettled after reading it.I suggest that 'Bellweather' be read prior to reading 'Passage'. Otherwise, the reader might be so put off as to avoid the author's other fine novels and short stories."
4,A good read...though not my favorite Willis book.,"Connie Willis is one of the most amazing writers of contemporary sci-fi/fantasy, and Passage was wonderful: haunting, full of characters you can't help but love, full of mystery. Only Willis can pull off the stunning plot twist that happens halfway through the novel (read it to find out what I'm talking about) and the ending that stays with you long after you close the book. And only Willis can write a novel about near-death experiences that doesn't pretend to know all the answers, yet leaves you feeling you know more than you ever needed to. My only complaint is that it seemed to drag on in spots. For instance: the constant, drawn-out descriptions of negotiating the labyrinthine corridors of the hospital-under-construction. This is a great novel, however, but I would highly recommend Willis's Doomsday Book or To Say Nothing of the Dog before I would recommendd Passage."
3,"Good, but not her best","At 700+ pages, with lengthy descriptions of travels through a labrynth of a hospital and exactly how many phone messages the main character has to fast-forward through, Passage is a bit on the indulgent side, suggesting that Connie Willis has used the screwball comedy of ""Bellwether"" and ""At the Rialto"" once too often. However, she makes up for it with an intriguing plot, and a daring that sets her apart from most science fiction (well, make that fiction, period) writing these days, It's not up to ""The Doomsday Book"" (my vote for her personal best), but it is a smart, entertaining diversion."
5,It's About That Most Often Avoided Subject: Death,"Connie Willis writes about real death, not avoiding it but basking in it. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I never felt it bogged down for me, perhaps because I was imbued with Ms. Willis's fascination for Death early on in the novel, and never looked back. I looked forward to the beginning of each new chapter, with a quote from yet another person near death. If anything, I felt breathless as I lunged through this novel, picking up the feeling of characters who never seem to be able to get enough rest or something to eat. I agree that there is very little Science Fiction here, but a topic always skirted around in so many other works receives such a thorough exploration here, that I can heartily recommend it to Science Fiction and other readers alike."
2,Almost but not Quite...,"...believeable and not paced to avoid boredom. I really, really enjoy Connie's books and have bought and read all of them to date, but this one completely missed the mark for me. Yes, good starting premise. Okay, the characters are sharply and deeply drawn. But I felt the book could have been half the length and still accomplished as much: too much distracting avoidance by the protagonist of one or two jerk characters in many scenes drove me crazy and the characters do things that just don't make sense. And lastly, the ending did not at all work, I found it a total letdown on a literary level and also emotionally. I loved Doomsday and her more ""scifi"" books with time travel, I was enraptured by ..Christmas Stories but I just can't recommend Passage like her others."
3,every other Connie Willis book is better,"Just as another reviewer said, this one dragged a lot compared to her others. I enjoyed it, definitely, and would recommend it to Willis fans, but it should certainly not be the first Connie Willis book you read. She has written such wonderful books! This one contained a lot of good stuff, but it did go on and on, and, unlike those of her other books, many of this one's apparently extraneous details turned out to indeed be extraneous, unless I was missing something. I love the way Connie Willis can bombard you with details that seem like fluff at the time and then turn out to be extremely important and vital to the plot, so it was disappointing to find this book to be far less tightly constucted."
1,I think I underwent a near-death experience reading this book.,"I really tried to like this book, but it had to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. It went on forever, and most of the novel consisted of people endlessly running a maze of corridors in a hospital. Except for Kit and the little dying girl, most of the characters were paper thin. I really thought near the end of the book that the endless hospital passages were the near-death experience. The message was bleak, and I was totally depressed by the end of the novel. I've not read anything else by this author, so my experience might be a quirk. Also, this book might appeal to someone else, but I had a terrible time with it and wished I had never read it. With all apologies to the author."
4,"It was good, but I have a small gripe","I found the story to be engaging and the characters were a bit stereotypical, but realistic and likeable. The scientific premise and the wonderful fine line between the knowable and the supernatural was handled beautifully. Highly recommended overall.My complaint is one that I have had with Willis' books before -- the artificial tension created by the reader knowing that one character has the information that another character needs to know, but they keep missing each other. In moderation, this is a wonderful device, but in Passage, it seems that the reader knew everything they needed to know to piece everything together by the end of the first 2/3, so the final section was just the frustration of trying to get everyone synced up. A little of this type of irony goes a long way. The ending (and plot twists) did surprise me."
5,What a great book!,"This author has done a masterful job of answering the question of life-after-death in a way that STILL leaves room for many interpretations. Yes, the story's ending gives a definite answer. Or does it? hmmmmmI inhaled this book, literally could not put it down, and I was sorry to turn the last page and know it was finished. I even stood over the stove cooking dinner with my nose in the book!I haven't yet read the 'Doomsday Book' but I have to take a long plane trip this week and I'm taking it with me. If that book is as good as this one was, my trip will be very pleasant, indeed."
2,Wasn't impressed,I had read positive reviews on this site so I decided to pick the book up but I wasnt thrilled at all. It was uneventful and slow moving and for the book to take 500 plus pages to finally get moving is way too much to ask.I kept expecting a Great payoff after a slow start but it never happend.
1,READING THIS BOOK CAUSED ME A NDE,"I've read several of Connie Willis' books - To Say Nothing of the Dog; Doomsday Book; BellWeather - and I enjoyed them all immensely. So as I read Passage, I kept waiting for the book to hold my interest, and by the time I got to the end of the book I felt cheated to realize I had just finished reading a very silly story with flat characters, inane dialogue, and a pointless plot. Although the premise of the story is very intriguing, I just don't feel as though Willis had done anything worthwhile with her idea. Passage had none of the intelligence that Willis brought to her other books. If you are looking for a good book, don't pick this one."
1,Rasberries,"Damn! So many pages, such a rotten payoff! This book is limp. I have loved CW's books, but this one must have been for the publisher!"
1,OH Please!,"Do not waste your time on this book! You'll see more flushed out characters in Dr. Seus than in this absurd novel about near death experiences. My favourites (not) are Dr. Hunk - aka Richard Wright and the Dickensian sick kid Maisie. The plot is largely made up of people describing in tedious detail how they got from one hospital department to another or what great lengths certain characters go to avoid other characters, leading up to a truly banal conclusion that is particularly long in coming because it is so hard to stay awake while reading this tripe!"
2,Tedious and predictable,"Based on a very weird premise, Willis tries for tension but achieves only tedium. The characters are not plausible, the plot is too easy to predict, and the whole is unsatisfying.I just hope I never have a near-death experience. I wouldn't want to run into any of the cardboard characters in this book."
2,"Good idea, poorly told","After ""Doomsday Book,"" I swore I'd never read Willis again. But the topic here - near-death experiences - seemed interesting, so i gave her another chance. Well... same ol' stuff, really. This is a wonderful story, hard to put down, with some engaging characters, and some good-sounding scientific speculation, and a truly haunting payoff. At the same time, it's an incredibly irritating read, full of characters and situations whose only purpose is to get in the way and annoy the poo out of the main characters and, I assume unintentionally, the reader. Connie Willis may be the world's most annoying story-teller. Her stories are told in a setting of non-stop frantic, frenetic, and frenzied mayhem, and almost all of it is petty, silly, everyday dreck that just kills the narrative. So. Once again, great story idea, terribly told. And this one really could have earned an ""A."" Shame."
2,Had to meet a deadline,"I was enjoying the book Passage, keeping the pace of page turning while waiting for more! But the more never came. I was so disappointed when I reached the end and didn't get #1 a finality to the plot, nor a reasonable ending. This was the first book I have read by Connie Willis and picked it up due to a review and the fact she lives 10 minutes from my home. I think with the way it ended Connie had a deadline to meet and abruptly ended it. I must admit I gave the book to my niece with the suggestion of using it in her book club in Breckenridge. I feel it is a great book to discuss and rewrite. I enjoyed the characters very much and felt they were well defined only abused by the author."
2,Tedious,"Wow, did this book need some editing. I think cutting two-three hundred pages would have done this book a world of good. I was drowning,(excuse the pun)in the minutiae of Joanna's life, which really slowed the book down. Are writers getting paid by the word again?"
1,Desperately needs an editor,"I read this book shortly after its release and was terribly disappointed by it tedious length, her unfunny and tangential attempts to place screwball comedy in the narrative, but mostly by the intellectual dishonesty. She writes scathingly of the new age researcher who seeks evidence of afterlife in NDEs and thus 'spoils' her subjects for any further research, and then expects us to believe that most people experiencing NDEs visualize the Titanic. I didn't post at the time because, well, even the best writers can have an off project, but I am 50 now pages into Blackout, and ready to put it down. It suffers the same problem with bloat and unrestrained and unfunny screwball elements. Willis has obviously reached the point of success where she is no longer receiving strong feedback from editors who can work with an eye toward readability, and not cave in awe of an acclaimed writer. It's a pity. Willis's talent has been eclipsed by her schtick."
1,Should have been an non-fiction book instead,"Miss Willis' explanations of the NDE phenomenon--scientific and otherwise--were food for thought. That, to me, was all that was good about this book. The characters were one-dimentional. Joanna Landers did not interest me and her internal dialogues were repetitive. I repeat, her internal dialogues were repetitive. Richard Wright's characterization was ""a really cute doctor"" and he always sounded like he was reading some sort of scientific journal. Then there's this young girl, Maisie, who was nothing more than character reciting a collection of great disasters. Same with this guy who keeps talking about the Yorktown. Mr. Mandrake was a stereotype. Great characters define a good novel, and none of Miss Willis' characters were interesting. I would've gotten the same satisfaction from reading about NDEs (and great disasters) in a non-fiction book."
1,Lame.,I can't believe I wasted 7OO+ pages of reading time on this tedious piece of mediocrity. Ugg... First and last book I'll read by this author.
2,disappointed...,"I wanted to like this book, but the characters fell flat, and the narrative felt forced. The concept behind it was interesting, but its exposition was prolonged and read like, well, exposition. I wish Willis had cut the book by half and then re-written it with good writing in mind."
3,Passage by Connie Willis,"Ms. Willis had an excellent story idea and is a good writer, but badly needs a better editor. At almost 600 pages, the story should be cut by 1/3."
3,I wanted to like it ...,"I'm interested in the afterlife, and certainly interested in accounts of near death experiences, but ""Passage"" felt ... contrived. The premise that researchers had come up with a drug that could induce a near death experience was very interesting to me, and the book sounded great, but in my opinion, it just didn't deliver. As other reviewers have said, Connie Willis may have missed the boat, symbol-wise, and various little subplots popped up, but really didn't go anywhere. I found the main characters likeable, but not particularly deep. My biggest quibble with the book was its pace, which was sluggish at best. I've read that Willis wanted readers to puzzle along with the characters, but I didn't enjoy the puzzling. It just made me impatient. So many people have raved about her, that I'll try another of her books, but ""Passage"" just didn't win me over."
1,Message to Connie....,"Connie,in the book, one of the NDE characters is a Navy Veteran who cannot stop talking & rambling. Our heros, Joanna & Dr. Wright, are always trying to get him to shut up. And yet......this book rambles on and on about trivial things that do not add to the story. How many times do we need to hear about the confused map of the hospital or the cafeteria never being open. Good God, this 780 page book could have been a tight read at 200 pages.I'd go on with my scathing review, but then I'd be a hypocrite.One more thing: the purpose of this is to encourage you to be more succint in the future.Good luck."
2,repetitious,"Connie Willis is a decent storyteller with an extremely limited vocabulary. ""Confabulating"" appears at least a dozen times, as the single term to describe filling in memory gaps by fabrication. But that is just a striking example of what is altogether scratchy prose. Ms. Willis' writing is laudatory for a junior high school student.The book, about near death experiences, is repetitious to the extreme. The main characters are clueless doctors. There were many opportunities to explain medical constructs which Ms. Willis skips over to instead pursue the senseless scurrying of her lead character.If you like science fiction, there's not much to like here. If you like character development, there's not much to like here. If you like an intriguing plot, you've chosen the wrong book."
3,it's just too long,The fascinating possibilites raised are not done justice because it's just too long and literally cluttered with dead-ends. She could have written a brilliant novella and captured the climax just as well.
3,Is this why she wins all these awards?,"Well. It kept me reading, but I can't say it's because I enjoyed the book. The characters were all either unsympathetic or unbelievable (this from an alleged master of characterization?), while the symbolism alternated between being heavy-handed and meaningless (and sometimes managed to be both.) I kept going because a) a lot of people had encountered a ""problem"" near the end, and I wanted to see what made them put it down, and b) I wanted to see how she would resolve the central metaphysical problem. With respect to ""a)"", what gave them pause I found a relief; as for ""b)"", well, chances were it was going to be a bit of a letdown, and it was, but I can't really fault her for that.Oh, and it was too darn long.In the end, my reaction has to be ""Meh."" I'd reccomend reading Jamil Nasir's _Distance Haze_ -- I think he handled a similar concept much better. And the best part is he did it in around half the length."
2,What a lot of filler!,"Connie Willis, whom I usually trust to turn out something interesting, did indeed turn out something interesting... The idea this book puts forth is fasinating, but it shouldn't have taken six hundred pages... This is a mystery story featuring the dull. Wait for the paperback, or better yet, skip it."
2,A somewhat interesting look into the mind's inner workings,"I was completely underwhelmed with this story from an author that I'd heard such good things about. I kept thinking as I read that the story had it the limited creativity and imagination of a Lifetime made-for-TV-movie.I gave the book two stars instead of just one because of the interesting way Willis detailed how memory works and how the human brain deals with death.Unless you have a dying need to read fiction related to Near Death Experiences, I'd pass on this book."
1,Skip This One,"Fortunately, like some other intelligent reviewers, I stopped reading this exercise in tedium after about 300 pages and snuck a peek at the ending. What a waste of time, for reasons other reviewers have clearly used in their comments. Also fortunately, I know Willis is an excellent writer (judging from her short stories) and I will not let the crashing bore that is Passage deter me from reading some of her other novels. As for this one, skip it!"
2,"Enthralling Book, But Ending Stinks!!!","I spent two days this weekend reading ""PASSAGES"" and it totally ruined my weekend. Granted, the characters were captivating and felt life-like. So did the hospital, Mercy General, even with all of the construction going on which was a little too much. I am very much into NDE's so the ending was very disappointing and I did not like the way it was all wrapped up. But I did learn a thing or two about the medical view of NDE's and I still disagree with it. I felt that the author tried to discredit NDE's and she ruined the entire concept for me in the ending. It should have been more uplifting. There was no closure at the end. So, all in all, two stars were knocked off the rating because of the crappy end."
1,Slow Pain and Anguish.,"After reading Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog, I couldn't wait to start reading Passage. Unfortunately, after struggling through three hundred pages of the main characters constant `rehashing' I realized I was wasting my time. I skimmed the next fifty pages, decided it wasn't worth skimming, read the last chapter and threw it in the trash so nobody else could read it. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Boring,"This book is primarily one thing: Long-winded and boring. Even the ""shocking turning-point"" and ""revelation"" towards the end are trivial and contrived."
3,Interesting but wordy,"This was my first book by Willis so I had no preconceived ideas. It was too wordy and hard to be interested in the first 200 pages plus too full of medical babble. The characters were well thought out and the plot surprise midway through worked - got me hooked! Without giving away anything, her recurring theme for death seemed a bit overdone - I was waterlogged by the end. I enjoyed her writing style and quirks of humor; she has the underused ability to write dialogue that actually sounds as if people would talk that way. It's worth your time if you already like her writing or near death interests you."
3,Vaguely Dissatisfied,"I had been looking forward to a new Connie Willis novel, so I wanted to like this book. Yet I couldn't help but feel vaguely dissatisfied throughout. The characters weren't very deep. While the idea was interesting, the plot felt a little too contrived and a lot too repetitive. The idea of puzzling through it all seemed appealing at first, but eventually I wanted to just shout at the book, don't you remember what she said way back on page 300-whatever? We did this already!"
4,A Fabulous Thriller,"""Passage"" is one of those novels that you put down and wonder how one writer could have made such insights into the human spirit.In her latest novel, Willis takes a look at NDE's (Near Death Experiences) and focuses on two doctors researching the phenomena. Willis develops the characters beautifully, and portrays Joanna Lander, the main character as a workaholic who slowly spirals into obsession after having her own induced NDE.Connie Willis is a very talented writer. This book demonstrates her amazing writing ability-- the characters are well developed and sympathetic, The plot is engaging. I read this book in a night, unable to put it down.The last 150 pages will shock you; this is one of the best twist endings I have ever seen. Even if you don't like thrillers this is a book that should not be missed."
5,"A haunting, heart-pounding page-turner","I simply could not put this novel down. It took me three days to read, and I resented every interference that pulled me away from it: my job, the telephone, even dinner! Willis has crafted a masterful, intricate plot featuring an engrossing theory about what happens when we die. Weaving dozens of separate, seemingly unrelated plot threads skillfully and just out of sight, she builds the suspense slowly to an astonishing crescendo that literally made my jaw drop. Despite a few minor plot elements that run on too long, this remains one of the best novels I've read all year."
2,Fuchs is right,"Fuchs, first reviewer wrote: ""Connie Willis is by far my favorite author and I am disappointed to say that this book doesn't hold up to her best work. If you are new to Connie Willis, by all means pick up ""Doomsday Book"" first..."". Unfortunately I read Passage first and readily admit to being under-whelmed. Maybe she is better than this book--when I find the time I may try the others that Fuchs recommends. But this book was a long time getting to very little."
3,I got it already,"Ordinarily I like Connie Willis very much. I would have loved this book at half the length, but at over 700 pages I have to say at least half is wasted. The idea is, as always, clever and well executed, but I got it at about half way through and although there is an interesting twist to the sub-plot, it does not justify the length. I won't give away the punchline, but it is hardly worth the time. At the end (finally!) I was left feeling cheated. In the words of the old Peggy Lee song, ""is that all there is?"""
5,Loved it!,All the wonderful pieces to a fantastic story. Compleatly unpredictable. (kind of like my spelling!)
2,Disappointing,"I give this book 2 stars only because it is well written and a convincing portrait of what an NDE (Near Death Experience) might be to an individual incapable of belief in anything beyond scientific fact. I, personally, am a believer in the NDE experience, though certainly not in the vein that Ms. Willis presents in her book as her ""villain."" If you are looking for any sort of fictional spirtual enlightenment, you won't find it in this book."
5,What a twist...,"Yes, the book is slow. In fact, I really didn't like it the first time I read it... at least, until I got through the first couple hundred pages.Then I read it again.This book is full of both wry AND black humor, lots of scientific technobabble, and enough twists and turns and ""oh, I know this I know this oh what is this"" on-the-tip-of-my-tongue suspense. The twist at the end of (I believe) Part Two, when Joanna finally figures out what's going on, stopped me in my tracks. It is worth waiting for.Another interesting part of the book, often overlooked, is the labyrinthine nature of the hospital in which Joanna and her colleagues work, and the kender-like nature of Richard, who always seems to have what's needed.This book is worth getting and reading, several times, until you're sure you've got it. Then read it again; you'll be certain you missed something good. Buy this book. Right now.I'm not kidding."
3,In search of...an editor.,"Inside the 800 pages of Passage is a riveting story. Unfortunately, that story is only about 400 pages long.This is a good book that desperately needed an editor. There is page after page of redundant and unnecessary details, jokes run on far too long (enough with the cafeteria hours, already!) and general bloat. The story is compelling. The ideas are intriguing. And the ending, despite being telegraphed well in advance, offers a very satisfying experience...even if it does run on and on and on and on and on until you just want it to get to the point. If she had just trimmed out the fat it would have been better. Much better.As it stands, you'll find yourself skipping whole pages just to get on with the story...and probably not missing much, if anything at all, when you do."
2,"HELLOOOOOO, EDITORS?","This is still another book read in recent months that sorely needed editing. Does a reader really need repeated tedious references to the intricacies of the hospital's corridors? I got the idea after the initial explanation.Whenever I'm hit over the head with repeated narrative, I always feel as though this is done simply to pad the text. Are they paid by the word?I have almost always enjoyed Connie Willis' work. She has interesting concepts and fleshed-out characters. This, unfortunately, cannot be on my recommended list."
5,GREAT EXPLANATIONS!,Great emphasis on visual aids. Organization is great and easy to understand. Author does an excellent job of explaining. Includes some great examples of speeches throughout the book. Great section on speaker anxiety - helped a lot.
1,Bad mastering,"Belive or not, songs are taken from Lp record. What's the point of buying this in that case? To me cd must represent the best audio available. Ok, i understand if mastertapes are lost - most of the case when it comes to fifties and sixties music. But those songs from 70's- come on-- tapes are sitting in the vault and SONY using a LP as the master.. This is wat I call poor mastering but maybe you can not expect more when paying nearly 12 dollars..."
1,Crap.,"You know why these headphones are so cheap to buy? I'll give you one guess. Yup, it's because they ARE cheap. I bought a pair through an Amazon Seller and within a few weeks of using them, only one side works now. Pay more money and get a better pair. I'm pretty sure these other reviews about the headphones were written by someone trying to sell them."
3,The original Dalek adventure.,This is the first doctor who book featuring the daleks. It suffers from the fact that it was written before the daleks as a race were fully developed so it suffers from some severe inconsistincies. Having said that there is some good imagary like the petrified forest (being a product of the kaled/thal war). It is also interesting just to see where these well known creatures began.
1,This DVD STINKS!!!!,"KoRn is a great band, but this DVD is NOT great!! The very first screen should be a warning, it says ""This video contains no music or performances by KoRn"". The ""host"" tries to act cool by being tough and cussing a lot; he just looks like a jackass!! I am very sorry I bought this DVD, it is a total waste of money. Hopefully KoRn will release a new video for the fans; until then, I hope you would keep your money (I wish I did)."
1,WORST VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"I love korn, they are one of the best bands ever in my opinion. But this is the worst piece of Sh&$ I have ever seen. There is this guy that watched the ""Who then now"" video and took all of the information from that video and put it on his own. If you really want to see this video don't give this jerk any money just email me and I will send it to you. I will never watch it again. It's really that bad, it's almost an insult to the band that this guy made the video. He act's like he's the bands friend, but has never met them. He interviews people that knew them before they were big and the say like, ""yeah I was at a bar once and a band was playing the I think was named korn or something and If i remember right I pretty sure they sounded good"" So you get the idea, don't buy the video unless you want to throw your money away. Email me and I will send it to you!"
1,WTF?,"I am a HUGE KoRn fan, so you can only imagine how POed I was when I saw this. The video doesn't even have the band, except for one part, which is 1/2 a mile away from the band. Plus, the host tries to be tough and cool by cursing, but he ends looking like a total jack-ass. I would only recommend this to the most die-hard KoRn fan who wants everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, anyone else hould just leave this DVD on the shelves and boycott it!"
1,What was this?,"I love KoRn, i am probaly one of there bigest fans. So i wanted to get every dvd/CD related to them. Then i bought it. It told me all the same info that i already knew before. I though it would at least have 1 interview with them, well it dosen't. I would rate this dvd lower than a 1 star but i can't. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"
3,"KoRn Unauthorized, Damn!","Not the best thing to come out with KoRn's name on it, but not the worst, the narriator seems totally stupid. can't stand the guy. but good info on their base of growing upa dn music roots, Bakersfield."
1,it's an insult to korn,"I bought not the vhs, but the dvd of this worthless peice of film. I thought unauthorized was just the title of the movie. It really is unauthorized. Korn wasn't even consented about this movie. Don't make the same mistake I made, don't buy this movie."
1,this video is the worst ever,this video duzn't deserve anything just a bunch of people acting like koRns friends. My advice if you want a good video of koRn buy who and then it is ten times better than this suckey video!
5,Music Is My Life: Helen Reddy's Another Big Hit In Thailand,"I don't know much about the situation of ""Music Is My Life"" at international level. But I would like to say that this song has been a very big hit in Thailand since I was a teenage. It is one of the hard-to-find songs. I think this may be the first time it is produced in the audio CD format. Thank you, RAVEN."
2,Only the submarine was interesting,"I agree with two other reader/reviewers that this was a dull and badly written book. Louisa was (we are led to believe) an early feminist, with frustrated longings. Gabriel is a mixed up rake. Their sexual fencing is boring and unreal. The submarine was the only really interesting part of the book. I may try another Putnam, but only if I find it at the library."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I had read Eileen Putman's earlier book, A Passionate Performance and was actually moved to write her a fan letter! (Which incidently I never mailed) Never Trust a Rake is so unlike her earlier writing that it's hard to believe it's the same author. I couldn't even finish the book. The story was uninspired and contrived. The writing was poor. The hero/heroine were never developed to any realistic degree. Their pasts didn't seem to shape their characters beyond their marked distaste for each other. I couldn't understand why Gabriel was so constantly ""snarky"" to Louisa. His character was totally one-dimensional. Ditto for Louisa. They snapped at each other throughout the book, and all I kept asking myself was WHY? 2 stars because the book held me for at least the first half. Barely. Anyone interested in reading what Ms. Putman is capable of should pick up a copy of A Passionate Performance."
2,"So-so story, minor characters more interesting than hero!","This was a disappointing book from Eileen Putnam. Although it had some amusing moments, overall I really could not get particularly interested in either Louisa or Gabriel. The scene another reviewer mentioned, where she stripped naked and demanded that he make love to her, was just totally beyond all credibility. As for the crazy rescues, the narrative was too improbable for words.The only really interesting characters in this book were David and Violet, and we saw far too little of their romance. Violet is the victim of a brutal marriage, pregnant by her husband's last rape of her; David is a traumatised ex-prisoner of the French, who believes he is incapable of being with a woman. Their courtship is beautiful, though far too little is shown, and I wish Putnam had concentrated on this rather than Gabriel and Louisa, who I really did not like at all.As for the submarine stuff... BORING!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I have Plan 9 from outer space rifftrax. I bought this dvd because it stated live. I thought there would be new riffs like they had done with reefer madness, but it was the same riff as the regular plan 9 rifftrax. There are some shorts and even music? For me at least the shorts were'nt that good. I would not have bought this If I knew the movie would be exactly the same. So, If your just interested in the movie, the regular rifftrax or the live rifftrax are identical."
1,wrong item ordered,"I thought I was ordering the large sugar crystals used on top of products like fruit turnovers, as sold in bakeries.Natural Turbinado Sugar CrystalsI wish the picture of the close up was larger or it had been shown on a bakery item."
4,Lauren Brooks Kettlebell Lightning with Alex Verdugo DVD,"A no nonesense routines and instructions. DVD assumes some familiarity with kettle bells and movements.Due to holidays, i have not used it routinely."
3,not bad,"Works perfect for my suzuki Z400, however it still sort of gets water in it. Would not buy another."
3,Not too useful,"This is an OK product, but not extremely useful. You could put a flashlite or your keys, etc. but not much else. While it is a handy location, the attachment to the handlebar is not great."
5,"great idea, great product",purchased this for my son to keep his cell phone and wallet in while he's riding his ATV. What a great idea!!! Product is a nice quality.
2,KEEP LOOKING THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS!,This book is okay but if you are looking for a good how to knit or reference book I highly recommend: The Knitters's Companion or Vogue Knitting The Ultimate Reference
2,not worth it,"I had hear good things about this book. Unfortunately. they were mistaken. By trying to cover both knitting & crocheting, the author doesn't give adequate coverage to either one. The instructions are not nearly detailed enough. The patterns are the same as any other how-to book and could easily be found online for free. This book should have been split into separate books for each craft so more detail could be given for each one."
5,Adequate for the basics,"Some people have complained that this book wasn't in-depth enough for them... Well, the book is a guide! It doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive, comprehensive text. But it is definitely a great reference tool to learn the sheer basics. The illustrations and accompanying descriptions for learning the crochet and knit stitches are very good. Previously, seeing a pattern for a project would have intimidated me. Now I can understand them and have successfully created some articles that I'm very proud of.To get you started, I would recommend this book. It's quite convenient to have to different styles of stitching in a single book. I have found it to be quite handy as I continue learning to perfect my crocheting and knitting skills.Again, it's just a primer into these beautiful arts. You can't expect to become an expert overnight, but you will be able to tackle easy and intermediate projects for sure. I suppose it all depends on our individual learning styles."
5,Pictures,Wow lots of pics to show me step by step on how to knit and crochet. Couldn't be any better.
2,A Start But Not Beginning,"This book does attempt to provide detail information for beginners (I being one of them). It has great information on the basics such as types of yarns, gauges, understanding of the types of stitches, and so on. However,the pictures that accompany some of the stitches aren't always visually clear to understand because they are in two different colors (red and blue). I had hoped to find full color instructions but was sadly disappointed. The publishers should have spent the money for colored pictures in the instructions not the patterns."
5,good beginner book,this book is comprehensive and easy to understand in learning the art of knitting and crocheting.
2,OK book...and old too,"This book did provide some pretty good pieces of information to take away, but unfortunately, the rest of the book is pretty poor. I disagree with his trading style and philosophy. Obviously it works for him since he's been trading for awhile, but it doesn't seem to click with many. Also, this is a very old book. I got sick and tired of reading about this new invention called the internet and how you can actually trade on it and so forth. If a book is any good, it ought to be updated periodically. Like I said, there was some valuable information. But getting through the rest of the book to find it was a pain. If you're going to buy it, buy it used."
1,Sounds great but doesn't work,"All sounds very professional but doesn't work. Follow the material and you will lose money! The proof is I signed up for his email alert services and after three months, I am down $15,000. Save your money. And if you need proof, email me at the address below and I'll send you my tracking sheet to prove my point."
4,Super,"This book is more than an option book. Actually it concentrates more on the technical analysis than options. It tells you what to look for in the charts, option volume and oprn interest, and then which option strategy to use. This is by far my favorite book on stocks and options."
1,Don't Waste your money on this Book,"I bought this book from Bernie's sales force. He has a high powered telephone telemarketing crew that look to sell you the world of promises and riches. Beware!I bought a newsletter and lost money. I bought the book and found it wandering. This man has lost his way confused about whether he trades or sells his wares. If he is so good trading and market timing then why does he not manage money for a living?The answer is simple can't trade then you sell your opinion and proclaim yourself a guru. Well I bought in as a sucker and am out a lot of money. I asked for a refund and am told it is non refundable. Convenient. I would give the book away but I don't want anyone to get caught like me. Firewood is an idea!I have since found other books on the Amazon top 10 option bestseller list that hit the mark and taught me what I wanted to know.Oh, Bernie above Wade. Well talk about scraping the barrel of comparisons."
1,Worst Newsletter Service,The service is a sure way to loose money. I consider myself as a novice investor but I can do better on my own than following his advise. Talking to service rep is waste of your time and effort. The service rep will listen to you but do nothing.The research company refuses to refund unused portion. What a nice TRAP. I wish I had read the reviews over here before I threw my hard earned money.
2,Roadside Geology at 60mph,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It does provide a macro description of the geology of Northern California, but the title does not match the contents. I was looking for a book that would give specific locations and features to observe at those locations. Locations given are very vague, on the order of ""about 5 miles"". Just hitting the highlights, it takes a full day just to see some of the major geologic features on the west side of Lake Tahoe, but this region is covered in only three pages of text.Again, it does provide a macro description of Central and Northern California's geology by describing the major rock units, but is short on detail and specific locations."
1,Cardio Capoeria #1 Flashdance,This is a poorly made copy of a person that can barely speak english. It just looks like a bootleg copy.
4,Useful Reference Tool,"As a pure reference tool it's great, but I always use more than one source for pinning down Release Dates. I have found some mistakes and I've just started double checking my music info. I guess there will never be one book with all the correct info."
3,Another Doo Wop Book,"I must admit that this is not my favorite ""Doo Wop"" book. I disagreed with too many of the author's points. However, the book does have merit! I especially enjoyed the groupography. I am not sure one can classify doo wop into neat catagories as the author's have done. Doo Wop was just so much more than a catagory. However, if you are ""into"" the music read the book."
3,Not my favorite book!,"I found this book to be confusing and hard to decipher at times!! I sometimes had to read the paragraph several times to get it and then I would find later in the book somewhere, what I was confused about was explained somewhat better. This book caused me to waste a lot of time trying figure out things. Perhaps better organization would be helpful. I wouldn't recomend this book."
5,Most comprehensive workbook,"Successful Lyric Writing is the best lyric writing manual/workbook I've ever used. I've owned a copy for years and purchased this for a nephew who wishes to hone his craft.Sheila Davis, in my opinion, does the best job explaining through lessons and exercises what actually makes a good song. From the different song forms to choosing the voice of the song (1st, 2nd, 3rd person) the author speaks in easy to understand language. I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to try their hand at songwriting."
3,"Almost, but not quite","Sheila Davis' book The Craft of Lyric Writing really missed the mark. The book adopted a purely passive teaching approach. Excellent content, but no involvement by me, the student. Kind of like going to a piano lesson and listening to the teacher talk and play the whole time. So, this book attempts to address that deficiency. It's OK, but it seems that the publisher left the whole matter up to Sheila, who is clearly not an experienced interactive book writer. The modern interactive book learning style that I've experienced so many times is not something the authors create themselves. This is obviously an attempt by Davis to address the deficiency of her first book, but it misses the mark. The exercises are shallow, infrequent, and leave me wanting some more experiential reinforcement."
3,First volume of Detroit inspired remix revival,"OK here we have some remixes from the cream of the worlds electronic producers (particularly Detroit) of a Belgian pop-disco band of the 70's and 80's. Now I know what you're thinking but let me allay your fears.From Carl Craig's rework of 'Moskow Diskow' you know if you're into Detroit Techno, Chicago House or modern electronic dance in general, you won't be frightened of this album. In fact you'll probably love it!Anthony Shakir's stunning remix of 'Raised by Snakes' is my personal fave, but elsewhere you will find great remixes by the likes of I:Cube, Ian O'Brien and Buckfunk 3000."
4,nothing says it a model,"I was not aware that this product was a model. It was easy to complete, but time consuming. There was no chain in the box, so I will have to improvise."
4,Not Happy,"I have been told that there were no cards included with the baskets indicating who sent them. The only information included was my name and phone number. These baskets were a gift from our company to a new customer and I had one of the recipients call me to thank me personally and ask who I was!Note, the basket itself, I am told, was very nice."
1,Not worth the price,The basket was very small and did not contain any quality products and the quanity was not there. It was very disappointing. I will not purchase from this company again.
4,:),"Bought this for a gift, and they loved it! :) It arrived right on time also, which was another plus."
3,GOURMET BASKET MEDIUM,"It is beautiful, but there were a few cookies that where stale. They immediately sent a care package as compensation. Their service is good and they care about their customers."
3,not a good value for the price,"For the price, it had a lot of stuffing and just a few small sized items. All was good quality though."
1,left out item,the basket i ended up getting did NOT have the smoked almonds that the product mentioned plus when it came out of packaging most of the stuff was sticking together. Not impressed with product and will not get this again. so getting this from the cyber week deal for 42 dollars is NOT a good deal.
5,The Four Things That Matter Most,"This book is a great personal soul searcher, I read it more than once. This is a gift. It was shipped quickly and was greatly appreciated. Thanks"
3,the four things that matter most: ma book about living,Was difficult to get into this book. Info was okay. I was hoping it would be appropriate for a dying friend but she died before I could read it to her.
5,The Four Things that Matter Most,"Very thought provoking for living out our lives, in todays hectic world....and preparing us for the end of our life...with no regrets...."
3,The Four things that matter most,A good book when you are in the mood to contemplate what is important in life. It was more an essay turned into a book than a book that explored many ideas in depth. Easy reading.
4,review of a review,"Donald Ardell's review of this book is brilliant. I hasten to add I never heard of him, so am not a relative. I have the highest respect for the commitment, passion, and compassion Dr. Byock has for human beings in wanting to help us live and die well, and this book comes out of that context. I like to imagine that I might have written this book, and then received Dr. Ardell's review. After taking in the sting, I would have to admit that what he wrote was honest, respectful and creative. It would inspire me to expand on what I had written. And I would have said... I needed that!"
4,The Hydra of Abuse,"This book has an important mission - to re-define abuse. Most people associate the term with beatings or verbal onslaught. But abuse is a spectrum of behaviours. Perhaps the most pernicious kind is the subtle, non-discernible and socially acceptable one. A doting mother, a demanding father, unrealistic expectations, a family ethos of not expressing one's emotions - are all forms of abuse and all might lead to trauma. Treating the child as an extension of the parent, a toy and the conduit of the parent's frustrated dreams and unfulfilled wishes is a violation of the child's forming boundaries. It is a perversion of the all-important processes of individuation and separation. It is a travesty and the child pays its price all its remaining life. Personality disorders are often reactions to such all-pervasive and pernicious abuse. Read all about it in this (somewhat academic) book. Sam Vaknin, author of 'Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited'"
4,Good Primer,"For those who have suffered through having parents who are narcissistic or have had siblings with the same dysfunction, this book will be of some relief. There are no guides on how to deal with the issue, but most books simply say to keep the narcissist at arms length (best case) or get them out of your life completely (worst case).I personally subscribe to the theory that narcissists are best dealt with by email or phone and in extremely small doses. I have two family members who are NPD and have eschewed them for years. It takes a long time to work through having been the victim of these types and this book may offer some help or relief or at the least: some understanding of the issue."
5,Essential Information,"For any student of modern psychodynamic psychology this is essential to your understanding of ""HOW did things get this way""Relatively little has been written about the early formation of Narcissistic traits as opposed to the full blown disorder. The authors consider the possibility that Narcissistic behavior may be a continum rather than just a state and show how children of self-absorbed parents can develop some, but not all, of the behavior associated with Narcissism."
4,More than just the Narcissitic Family-,"This is an easy to read book that would be valuable for both mental health counselors and other health care providers. It is based on the authours' experiences but grounded in theory, including, but not limited to Freud. The authors take a positive approach to helping persons raised in narcissistic family systems and focus on strengths, rather than on a psychiatric diagnosis or personality disorder.This book would also be a valuable resource for a persons seeking to understand his/her own adaptive behaviours whch may have developed from being raised in the narcissistic family."
5,"For the layman, too","This book was apparently written for professionals in the field. I'm not a professional psychologist, yet I found it very readable and incredibly insightful.Most of us probably don't see ourselves as coming from narcissistic families. The label carries a nasty connotation that we'd probably rather not have applied to ourselves. But if you find yourself stymied by recurring problems with relationships, chances are you did come from a narcissistic family.Understand that there is no stigma attached to that except what has been programmed into you to keep you from looking at the truth. Reading this book, I was amazed at the number of ways, often subtle, that narcissism manifests and subverts our humanity. This book was a revelation in both the emotional and intellectual sense."
5,Great tire!,"I paired this with a Kenda Aggressive in the rear. It has been a very long time since I have ridden, so I'm not starting exactly from scratch, but I have a long way to go to get my chops back. The tires that came stock on my bike were not as aggressively ""knobby"" ... more rounded off. For a faster, smoother and more skilled rider, this might work, but I tend to move more slowly and power my way over and through things. The singletrack I'm riding is all rocks, roots and mud, mud, MUD! I'm much happier with these tires ... the only drawback now is that when I slip and slide, I can't blame the tires anymore ... just my old, tired body and rusty skills.Used to run with a Panaracer Smoke/Dart combo. These seem just as good, and you really can't beat the price. (Hard for me to shell out the same money for a bicycle tire that I do for a car tire ...)Excellent traction, excellent value, have held up to roots and rocks with no pinch flats or tears."
5,very happy,"Cant go wrong for the price, I am very happy with the quality and the speedy shipping too. I would buy another as the need arises."
3,not bad but couldve been better,"I never saw the first unnamable but i wanted to give this one a chance anyway cause it sounded interesting.the movie is not all bad but it couldve been better then the final product.the demon looks good though i must saw and it had two or three moments of cheap pop up scares,which are good.the bllod and gore are decent but some kills you dont get to really see(like the lady cop toward the end)and i think thats a waste.the plot is ok but the movie drags in some places.i would say rent but that would cost around six dollars and i got a copy on amazon for only three so if your courious id say buy a cheap used copy.i hear the first one was better so im hoping they put it on dvd one day.a few of the kills were gory and thats always a plus."
4,"""Another H.P. Lovecraft adaptation""","Very chilling and atmospheric horror sequel to the ""Unamable"". Good story with good acting guaranteed to provide scares. If you like gothic horror you won't be disappointed.Don't watch this alone!John"
1,Oh Boy,"If you want to get rid of company put this on, it was one of the worst movies, and eventhough it was bad you could not help but watch(LOL)"
4,Great sequel,"Well, it was much better than the original, but literally had nothing to do with ""The Last Statement of Randolf Carter', which it claimed to be.Nonetheless, it was a Lovecraft based film, so therefore I HAD TO watch it Nor was I disapointed. It had the excellent acting of John Rys-Davies (you know, the axe-slinging dwarf in the Lord of the Rings Movies), and the gorgeous Maria Ford (naked scene), and even Julie Strain! So, we have nudity, the Necronomicon, pretty good acting (for the most part), and demons?!?!? COOL!Add it to your collections, HPL fans!Go on.Do it!Two cloven hooves up!"
4,Gives you more than the movie does...,"The Patriot was an all-right movie, and the novelization is a little better than all-right book. As in any novelization of a movie, more about the characters is divulged, and you get to learn more about them. Also, there are some scenes in the book that were deleted from the movie that add to the effect. Not one of the best books I've ever read, but it filled in some blanks left by the movie. All in all, if you enjoyed the movie, I reccommend the book"
4,Pretty Good,"I loved the movie. I know, I know. It portrays the British in an unfavorable manner. Who the hell cares? Let's face it, I fell in love w/ the character Gabriel Martin. :) So I knew I had to check this out, because I love reading books based on movie screenplays. I was not disapointed. You could tell that there were some sceens that were taken directly from the screenplay and placed in the movie, and other parts that were compleatly different (ie: in the movie, Ben Martain wasn't stabbed in the stomach twice by Tavington.) This was a great book, and I don't really care that it wasn't historically accurate. Just one question--was Anne pregnant? Ben makes a comment about being a grandfather, and Gabriel writes home about baby names. Um, I thought he was in a bundling sack?"
3,Not unreasonable,"the pricing isn't attractive for such a short documentary, and it comes with two copies of the dvd. I'm not sure why they do that, but hey, don't look a gift horse in the mouth right. but it's not exactly a gift horse because I paid for it. But the documentary was legitamite and useful."
1,Assume you know too much.,"This book is just too thin on substance to suit me. Too often do I come up dry when searching for a particular ""how do I do this"" for a maintenance or repair subject. It just doesn't go in depth enough even though it says it is built on a complete tear down of the vehicle. I actually have 2 books by this publisher each for a different vehicle and they are extremely close. I think there is a formula they use where they plug in just enough to make it appear vehicle specific. The areas of generalities such as basic overhaul are covered pretty solid in this book however; if you dont know a lot and are looking for a book to lead you through a repair then you will be better served to look elsewhere. Much better books are available here."
3,Is the fixed version out yet??,"The now ill-fated NUON just couldn't get a break. Plagued with poor (or completely absent) marketing support and buggy software, the DVD-based player/game system hit the market with a huge and painfully silent THUD. For evidence of its demise, look no further than IRON SOLDIER 3. Once hyped as a big release for this little system, IS3 was on the market for less than a week before being yanked due to a rather significant software bug. All copies were recalled after it was discovered that the game would crash on certain NUON players. Despite a promise of a prompt re-issue, the cash-strapped VM LABS (owner of NUON) was in such poor financial shape that they simply could not afford to re-release the fixed version of the game! If you have managed to get your hands on a copy, then a nice bounty is to be had among the stubborn NUON diehards via eBay Auctions. Otherwise, this remains an aloof novelty item that is symbolic of the misguided NUON system itself. R.I.P. NUON."
4,"Cheap and cheerful, does the job","I bought these to listen to continuing ed webcasts - comfortable and practical for this purpose. Haven't used them to listen to music yet, so I can't comment on using them for that purpose."
3,Naan Sprinkler,First off the sprinkler appears well made with a small footprint and simple to use. When I first fired it up it was extremely quite and dispersed the water very uniformly and at the distance described. I truely liked the product BUT it leaked from the base with the o-ring installed and after that I felt it was slightly too much money for what it does. Go with a metal base spike type sprinkler for the extra money and yes I would buy this again if the price droped and didnt leak.Cheers -
5,An infectious mobilizing motivator,"This book rocked my world(view)! Borthwick is infectious! His declaration that EVERY Christian must be a 'world Christian' flies off the pages in amazingly practical and highly motivating ways. Whether you are new to the idea of missions or not this book will be a literary 'burning bush' in your hands. WARNING: If we don't want the walls of the boxes we live in to be shattered around us, we best not read this book!"
4,Marx brothers,"Marx brothers were legend, these four films are must see of Marx brothers though the Duck Soup is still stands out.."
2,Why Would TCM give 1/2 the movies?,"Why indeed would they omit 'Night at the Opera' ? To include 'Night in Casablanca' instead seems disingenuous at best, sneaky at worse. If you'd like any other these Post Paramount and mostly lesser Marx movies, you should instead getThe Marx Brothers Collection (A Night at The Opera/A Day at The Races/A Night in Casablanca/Room Service/At the Circus/Go West/The Big Store)I expect much more from TCM. This collection seems as poorly conceived as, well, most of these later films themselves."
3,The Marx Brothers Collection,"I got it from the local library to rent and see it's pretty funny, old school slap stick stuff.some wisecracks/jokes newer generations might not get."
1,"Got gypped, not funny","At the Circus is a good movie. Unfortunately, and not as advertised, I downloaded the ""collection"" but that was the only movie that came through. Contacted Amazon and tried to discover what was going on; after waiting on hold for some time they answered, but the phone clicked and they hung up. $9.99 for a single Marx Brothers movie? That's not a great deal. I could do better at the DVD bin at the car wash."
1,Racist Author,"This book is about boring Penny placing a personal ad.I was horrified and betrayed by this novel,as the author-Kate William-spends the entire book making degrading jokes about Aussies...It's just mean...."
2,A festival of nine lessons and carols,It is great to be in a position to understand American English. The organ simply does not do justice to the program.
5,excellent product,"I bought this Memory Baby Book for my first grandchild and my daughter just loved it. She wanted me to get the same one for my second grandchild but I could not find it. I finally had to buy a different Baby Book but daughter was not happy with it and never filled it out or used it...instead she just used a baby's first year calendar that notated events and put special items like his first haircut clippings into a little box. While browsing Amazon I happened to see the book, daughter was ecstatic even though grandson is now one year old, so I ordered it. She got it very quickly and she is now in the process of putting all the information into the book. There are envelopes to put stuff and plenty of room to write the things you want and it is easy to personalize. We love this book."
5,An excellent female blues voice,A friend saw this band on vacation out in CA. He brought back this CD. It took me a month to find it. Well worth it !!!
5,Hair Salons should have these .. kills germs ect . ....,"My sister works at a hair salon ... she uses one of these antibac .... towels after each of her clients . Some of the clients will use one while getting their perm ... hair cut , ect . They work sooo good I take some every where I go . I will not say too much about this but.... before and after my boyfreind and I have "" fly me to the moon "" time , you know what I mean . With all said.... my family and freinds, well almost all use these towels .If you want to order these on amazon their are two (2)types .... unscented and fresh scented , I have the unscented.When you type in p . a. w. s. antimicrobail hand wipes , be sure to include ... unscented . If you like the smell of perfume you can get the "" fresh scent "". These hand wipes do not leave your hands with that sticky feeling likemany of the wipes do."
3,Holster,"Its a little tight for the guns, Ad is confusing I thought both holsters were being offered for price but only one is offered. Buying the right one on the page was confusing. Would think along time before buying from this site again."
2,"Looks okay, but not very useful.","This is a no-frills, leather holster. The leather is a very plain looking brown, but quite thick.The holster's thick belt loop carries the holster low, and at a 40-degree cant.It holds my PT99 tightly, and the top strap fits securely.The belt loop and carry height suggests that this was intended to be carried openly at the 3-o'clock position, while the angle suggests a concealed 4-5 o'clock position. Realistically, the holster isn't really suited for carry in either position.The leather, while thick, is quite soft. When drawing, the holster tends to bend and flex, making it very difficult to remove the pistol.I wouldn't recommend this."
4,"GO ahead, touch it!!!","as most pocket pc users know, there are those times of weakness when you are too lazy to take out your stylus. This is the answer to that, i really love not having to get my stylus out ever, this thing never has finger prints or dust, you can eat a whole box of french fries and then touch your screen without fear of oiling up your precious device! the only 2 things i am picky about were 1. it seemed to make the screen need just a tiny bit more pressure to touch, and 2. no matter what you do it traps dust under itself when you are trying to install it, but it is definitely better than the glossy one or not having one at all"
2,A unique perspective on the roots of the current struggle,"Having recently returned from a tour in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this book places a unique perspective on the underlying ethnic hatreds in the Balkans. The author weaves a personal story into the carnage that has permeated the Balkans for hundreds of years. The timeliness and relevance to U.S. involvement makes this a sleeper that is well worth the read."
2,Not up to her standards,"I have loved all of SEP's books, EXCEPT this one. This is the only historical book she has written, and while the period information is not very believable, the change in era is not the real issue. The characters do not seem in the least realistic, the chemistry between them is not very strong, and the story development is weak. I also did not like the secondary characters in this novel. Overall, if you are a fan of Ms. Phillips, stay away from this one, so your pleasure in her work remains unblemished."
2,Not one of her better books,I usually like SEP but this was drivel. Sorry. I'm just not currently into historical romances.
4,A delightful read,"This is the first book I've read by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and I found it rather enjoyable. Okay, so it may be a bit like Gone With the Wind - but not enough to matter. Although there are some similarities, I found it to be a fairly simple storyline. This book may not be great literature, but it's a pleasant read to escape with for a while. Everybody ends up happy in the end, and what's wrong with that?"
2,SHE HAS WRITTEN BETTER BOOKS,"MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD NO SYMPATHY FOR THE FEMALE LEAD, BUT I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO THIS BOOK. KIT SEEMED LIKE A ONE THOUGHT PERSON, AND THAT THOUGHT WAS A DETRAMENT TO HER HAPPINESS, UNTIL THE LAST CHAPTER.I WILL STILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO HER BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE WAS A DISAPOINTMENT TO ME."
2,"It kept my interest, but. . .","Like many, many people, I have LOVED most of Susan Elizabeth Phillip's other books, but anyone can tell that ""Just Imagine"" is a past (and outdated) book. In the 80's, it was common to have abusive, emotionally unavailable heroes, and that's what the hero is in this novel. The heroine is childish and spiteful in her obsession to obtain her family home. In short, you have two pretty dislikable characters who misunderstand, fail to communicate, and deliberately attempt to control and to ""top"" each other. In defense of the book, I did, however finish it; I just didn't really enjoy it much. Ms Phillips has come a long, long way in her writing."
2,Not your typical SEP book,"I have read nearly everything Susan Elizabeth Phillips has written and really like her work. I, however, did not enjoy this story, as I am not a big fan of historical romances, so I just couldn't finish it. If you're a fan of SEP's contemporary romances, just be aware that this isn't one of them. I also don't enjoy stories where there is so much aggression from the male protagonist. I know SEP typically shows hostility turning to warmth in her heros, but I had an especially hard time liking this guy, even after only reading the first third of the book. I guess I just don't like to see women getting walked on, and it definitely happened here. Read it if you like historical romances, but I don't recommend it to the typical SEP fans."
3,"Not bad, just not up to her current standards","""Just Imagine"" is a rewrite of Ms. Phillips first solo effort, which was originally published in 1884. If you have not read any of S.E.P.'s novels before, this is not a bad one to start with, but if you are familiar with her other outstanding titles (Dream a Little Dream, It Had to Be You, Nobody's Baby But Mine), you might find this one a disappointment. I found that it lacked the witty dialog and amusing situations that characterize most of Ms. Phillips' more recent works, and in fact was somewhat depressing."
4,My Favorite Author Does if Again,"what agreat book. Loved reading another Susan Elizabeth Phillips. One of my favorite authors. She makes you smile, laugh, cry and scream. The love interest in the story are two strongwilled and loveable characters. Their stories touched my heart. From eary childhood not to know love and to learn how to survive without it and to carry that shield with you until adulthood until it starts to crumble, that is the story that Susan Elizabeth Phillips gives us. I can't wait for another one."
1,Not good,"I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips' newer work. The ""football"" series are among my favorite books ever. I read very quickly and my authors can never keep up, so I re-read books over and over. That said, I threw this book away after the first time I read it.The characters are completely unsympathetic, and the plot line is contrived and ridiculous. I didn't care what happened and in fact was kind of rooting for the heroine to end up alone - not what you want to have in a romance novel.Read almost ANYTHING else by SEP and you'll get an enjoyable story and engaging characters. Skip this one."
2,"Same Old Stuff, Truly Unbelievable","I have read most of Ms. Phillips and there's nothing good I really can say about this one. I know it was written in the 1980s and then rewritten for 2001 distribution. One gets really tired of the supposed heroine who hates the hero and they fight, quarrel, etc. then at the end she realizes she has been wrong and goes after her husband. Please, give me a break. We've had enough of this type of writing. Lets try something new and exciting."
5,Just Imagine,This was a great book with such energetic characters. Interesting to learn about the cotton mills of the South and what the slaves endured.
2,It was an easy read . . .,however I skimmed a lot of the content. It was just plain boring. I'm SEP fan but I wouldn't read this one a second time.
3,just imagine,I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINT IN THIS BOOK. I HAVE NEARLY ALL HER BOOKS AND LOVE THEM ALL BUT THIS ONE SHOCKED ME. DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL . SORRY
5,Super rewrite of Phillips' 1984 Risen Glory!,"In case you don't have ($) to buy a rare, tattered copy of Phillips' first book from 1984, RISEN GLORY, you're in luck--Kit and Baron are back in this excellent rewrite, and they're better than ever!The Civil War is over for the rest of the country, but not for Kit Weston. She's come to New York City disguised as a boy to get revenge. Baron Cain stands between her and Risen Glory, the South Carolina home she loves. Unfortunately for Kit, Baron isn't just her bitter enemy, he's been appointed her guardian.Kit is an extremely strong heroine, but Baron is more than a match for her. If you love historicals where the heroine is disguised as a boy (I do!), and the hero and heroine are each other's natural antagonists, where the action never stops, the story is fast-paced, and the sexual tension burns, you will really enjoy this book--it has it all!"
3,Not As Good As Others,"I was really excited that Susan Elizabeth Phillips had come out with another book. Her contemporary novels are amazing. Just Imagine reminded me a lot of a Karen Robards historical. I was a little disappointed in this book because it seemed to follow a typical format. Young girl, dead parents, unlikeable guardian but handsome. Guardian and girl fall in love. Something just seemed to be lacking. I would definitely recommend this author, but maybe just not this book."
1,Did Susan Elizabeth Phillips really write this?,"I was completely dumbstruck by this book, ""Just Imagine"". This was definitely not one of Phillips' better books. So if you are a first time reader of her, please try her other books. Where this one lacked laugher and imagination, her other books will inspire and promote you to reread it just to make sure the good parts were not missed the first time through them."
2,"Not very fulfilling. It was ok, but so far my least favorite of her books.","The characters and plot weren't that good. Maybe it was due to being one of her early works. This story was first printed in 1984 and titled ""Risen Glory."" It was reprinted in 2001 with the current title. This book lacks her witty dialogue which I love in her later books.CAUTION SPOILER: I didn't understand the characters during their marriage as to why they were so cold to each other. I didn't care for her actions in the end to prove her love to him. It seemed that they got back together too easily without resolving the prior coldness.DATA:Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: about four. Just after the Civil War on a southern plantation. Copyright: 1984. Genre: historical romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, see my 5 star review of ""Glitter Baby"" posted 1/15/09."
1,Just Avoid,"This book is simply awful. If you have never read one of this author's books, don't start here. Cardboard characters, ridiculous potboiler of a plot, incorrect details throughout which distract (somewhat mercifully) from the period mood, leaden dialogue - there is nothing good to say about this, other than perhaps writing it showed Ms. Phillips the error of her ways and opened the door to her later, far, far better work.If you are an avid reader of her books, leave this one of your list to avoid admiration for this author. Anyone who is not willing to overlook straight out bad writing should avoid the book altogether."
2,"Started out Great, but turned Cold, Dark, and Unlikable","This book lacked for nothing at first. Kit was adorable and beautiful and Baron was sensitive and gentle. So why did Kit and Baron turn to ice? After they became lovers, they turned vicious towards each other. I can't figure out why the author did this. There was never a good explanation as to WHY this happened, either. Who wants to read about two characters who dislike each other that much?By mutual consent, Kit and Baron put unexplained personal animosity aside in order to sleep together. Meanwhile, the unexplained rage continued to build. I started dreading the rest of the story, but stuck with it in deference to SEP. There would have to have been at least a drop of love between these two in order to have the sort of ending SEP gave us.The slavery issue was unfortunately accurate, but there's no way Sophronia would have ended up so blessed in the end, not with such ignorance in the world during that time."
1,Don't buy it,"I have one of these and it's a pain because you can't see the iPoddisplay through the material. The result is you have to take the iPodout, when you stop/start your runs."
2,Poor design,"I read many of the reviews with the general consensus being poor and bought it anyway because... I wanted to protect the Nike+ receiver and the connector on the nano. I didn't see any similar products that offered a design for the Nike+ attachment.This fit ok but is much bigger then it needs to be. It is difficult to adjust. I can't adjust the volume and can't see the display. I don't really need to see the display but changing the volume would be a nice addition. Good news for me is that I left this in a hotel so I was forced to buy a replacement. This armband has been upgraded to one with a display but I went with a different manufacturer. The Sports armband from incase. This is a smaller armband but is more comfortable, it is easier to get on and off and I can see the diplay and adjust the volume. Run away from the Nike offering."
2,Disappointing Nike Product,"You would think a company like Nike would create a top notch product, especially working with a company like Apple. This is an inferior product just as all the other reviewers say.You can't see the screen while you're exercising. You can't change the volume in case a song comes on too loud or too soft.The only positive thing I can say about this product is that it fits well.There are much better options to consider."
1,Look at the photo carefully!,"I bought this item and was very disappointed when I got it because the iPod screen is not visible when the iPod is inserted in the armband. I didn't look at the photo carefully and assumed that the screen would be visible--wouldn't you?There is a raised button over the center of the iPod wheel so that you can feel what you are pushing, but without a screen it is not much use. I am very disappointed in Nike for producing such a product, and I hope that Apple did not approve it."
1,Doesn't work well for runners.,"I don't want to flame this device, but for me it doesn't work well at all. It is a very tight fit for the ipod, it makes it hard to get in and out.Once in, it is almost impossible to use the ipod, the cover doesn't line up well and often causes you to do the wrong action. Using the dial is almost impossible.The hole at the bottom for the speaker wire is not fitted correctly so it causes the wire to become disconnected easily.In short don't buy this product."
2,Doesnt do enough,"This armband, like others have stated, does not allow you to see the screen as you use it. It is not very intuitive. I plan to buy the new Nike+ armband within the next month and cut this one up to use as a sleeve when I am not working out."
5,Great product,"I highly recommend this product because it's extremely easy to use. I use a small MP3 player instead of an Ipod Nano, and it works without any problems. It's very easy to clean, and it doesn't have any hard plastic parts to dig in your skin and cause irritation.One lady I spoke with said she paid 3X more for the same product, thank you Amazon!! I will shop again."
1,"Not made for Ipod Nano, look elsewhere","I bought this for my Ipod Nano, this is not made for the Nano.Yes the Nano fits in the item, but the screen is not visible at all.The thick foam also makes the controls difficult.This was probably designed for the Shuffle and just repackaged when the Nano cought on.I had a much better Nike armband that had a cover that let you see the screen and access the controls(dog ate it).This armband is cheap, but not worth it at all.I am buying a better one very soon."
1,"Ridiculous, Designed quite possibly by Fisher-Price","First off, I'll talk about the size of the band. The armband is resizable by velcro and at it's smallest, it's too tight for my arm. I'm a runner not a bodybuilder, so go figure who on who decided the proper size for this thing should be. Next, a key feature of the Nike+ is......well, let's see, how about the fact that it can display all of your running data as you run? It shows MPH, laps, etc.... What good is it to display ALL of this data on the IPod Nano screen as you run....if the Nike+ case covers the screen completely. There are hundreds of Ipod armband cases on the market and this is the first one I have ever seen that covers the screen.So, to recap. It's way too small. And, while the purpose of the Nike+ is to display running stats.....the Nike+ armband covers the screen. Way to go Nike."
2,"Useful if you make some ""alterations""","Like everyone else said, it makes no sense that you can't see the screen. I often don't even use my headphones when I'm running - I just use the iPod+ to track my distance and keep cumulative totals for me. So I DO need to see the screen while I'm running.I ended up cutting a square hole where the screen is, and now it's perfect! Nike should just make this part of the design, and put a piece of clear plastic over it to protect the screen. Then, I'd give it a 4.5-star rating. The band is comfortable, and the controls work fine through the material."
2,"I've tried to like it, but I just can't!","I've tried running with this armband, and before I got the nike plus system it was ok. But as other posters point out, it's really tricky to end your workout at the precise time without hitting another button, etc. The nano fits in the armband, but the position is not absolute so the controls printed on the outside don't always line up with the nano buttons. The fit is ok for me, and I don't notice it while I run. Overall, I'd much rather just hold the nano while I'm running than deal with the workout controls. Also, as another poster pointed out, the headphone jack is very hard to find once you have the armband on. Maybe I'll try the upside down method to help me with that. Buy the $3-5 velcro armband with the cheap rubbery case from e-bay, I think you'll be happier."
2,"OK, but wouldn't recommend","This thing works, but is a hassle to get on and off. The iPod screen can't be seen, so you have to memorize the locations to make changes. It's pretty cheap, that's the only advantage I see to it over the standard Apple bands."
3,Needs a couple of tweaks.,"I received one of these as a gift. I was psyched to have a holder for my iPod nano -- many of my running shorts didn't have pockets to hold the nano. As a holder, it works fine. Nice and secure.A couple of tweaks are needed, however. First, there is no window, so as you scroll through a menu, you can't see it. Makes it VERY hard to find anything on your nano (actually, impossible). Second, the cover doesn't allow your touch to work well with the iPod scroll or buttons. You have to press very firmly, and I have had a very hard time adjusting the volume, since you must use a circular motion on the scroll, and it usually ends up reading it as ""click"" rather than a scroll, due to the lack of sensitivity.But, a good product if you are just looking for a holder with quick access to your Start or Stop or Forward/Back buttons."
3,Fast shipment,I received the product very quickly. I do not think that the velco on the armband will last a long time; I have used it twice and can feel the weakening of the velcro already.
1,This is a bad product.,"I have two main problems with this product. First, the pouch completely covers up the screen so that you can't see what's on your iPod's display. This effectively turns the device into an iPod Shuffle. This may or may not be a big deal for you since many runners are focusing on the run too much to fiddle with music anyway.The second (and biggest) complaint that I have is that the velcro strap is really hard to fasten. Usually on things like this, the armband will have a metal piece where you run one flap through the other side, then pull it tight and velcro. This version just has the velcro pieces on either side. Unless you arm is teeny-tiny, it's really hard to fasten this armband because you can't pull the two sides together easily.I'm sure that Nike will eventually fix the problems with this, but until then I would pass on this disappointing product."
1,Horribly designed!,"Possibly the worst design for an armband. A fifth-grader could make a better armband with felt, velcro, scissors and some thread. Not only can you not see the Nano screen, or adjust the volume while you are running (changing the volume is like trying to text message with gloves on), but you cannot adjust the tightness of the band with just one hand, it has too little elesticity and too small a velcro strip. To top it off, the Nano is kinda difficult to get in and out of the band."
1,NOT a good buy!,"This armband is too large for my arm. I am a somewhat small woman, but not tiny. The armband only stays put if I'm wearing long sleeves. But more annoying, the only functions that work while the iPod is in the sleeve are pause/play, reverse and forward. The neoprene does not allow you to adjust volume, and the center and menu buttons are useless since you can't see the iPod screen when it's in the sleeve. I curse this armband daily."
4,good cymbal for the money,"like others have said, this is a good cymbal for the money. It has that great trashy sound thats awesome for metal drumming and the like but let me tell you, this this will eat up a set of sticks in no time."
2,not so great.,"this cymbal is awful. really awful. i wanted a fun toy cymbal, a neat little accent to play around with, but this thing is not usable in almost any situation. the price is great but the sound is just terrible. you might like it, anything is possible, but this time i have to tell you to try before you buy."
4,love it!,this china is awesome i bought it thinking it wouldn't be that great but its better nothing but this china is absolutely amazing for its size i highly recommend this its got that real trashy crunchy sound that i love hearing in screamo and other metal music
5,High quality - great sound,"Bought the Ramrod after a lot of research into the popular speaker makers. Installed it into a Fender Super Champ XD (XCSD), and very happy with my investment! Base is solid and highs are great. The XCSD is a hybrid amp with a solid state preamp and tube power amp. The preamp models various other amps and needs a good speaker to reproduce them. The stock speaker is OK, but of course the Fender engineers had to control costs. A speaker upgrade looked like a good way to improve the XCSD.Some have recommended the Eminance Rajin Cajan, but it sounds too bright to me. Check out the sound clips on the Eminence site. Happy with my investment - thinking about trying the Lit'l Buddy :-)"
4,"Good book, funny notation though","So I took the class with the man last quarter and thought I did not need the book. Well, by the end of the semester I started reading it and I was pleasantly surprised by the organized nature of the book. Rubinstein's thoughts are well explained and there is a lot of clarity in his derivations, which are not overly mathematical . Rubinstein comes from another era in finance, an era when intuition was more important than the math. Right now, there is so much math in finance that intuition seems to be undervalued, which is a shame.If this book had a solid set of questions and answers at the end, it would be a great book. Then again, we got our own problem sets from the professor, so I can't complain about that myself."
3,"Show horse orientated, but that is who advertises. Lots of shaved, greased, and photoshopped horses here.","However, the magazine is high quality and does try to balance itself out with a monthly racing column, a terrific page to a historical arabian, and about 5 or 6 times a year, distance riding coverage. Cindy Reich's column is also thought provoking."
5,Great magazine for arabian lovers!,This is a great magazine for Arabian Horse Owners or those that just love Arabians.
1,Meh.... disposable chain is worthless for a days of cutting,"Cutting mixed soft and hard, chain initially cut well. However, it stretched after 10 min. of use. After 4 hours of cutting, the chain stretched beyond the adjustment screw.When cutting, he first contact with dirt causes this chain to crap out. Might as well break out a hand saw or axe....you will sweat less.Husky's are great saws..... chains...er......not so much. Going back to Sthil chains which actually cut and last."
4,Work great when brand new but my sharpening skills are weak,"After a couple of hours of use, these needs resharpening. Despite using a Husquvana kit, following directions, watching online videos, and trying on a hundred different occassions (over a dozen years), I cannot seem to sharpen these chains to last more than 20 minutes before they're smoking mightily and unable to cut dried birch limbs. Sadly, I have to keep buying new chains after each use. I thought my chain oiler was at fault and had an authorized dealer adjust it, but with no success. My saw is a Husquvarna 268 with 20"" bar."
2,Hasqvarna chain.,"The chain did not last but to cut a down tree in 14 logs, after that the chain neede to be sharpened. But the metal does not repond to the file well."
4,attractive but a bit stiff,I really think this is an attractive shoe but it was very stiff and took awhile to break it in
1,They're cheaper at the skechers website,I actually found these quite uncomfortable. Which is weird since I pretty much have like a million different pair of Skechers. This company selling them is not Amazon so be careful. I haven't been able to have any communication with them. I really suggest buying them directly from Skechers which has them at $50 (less than I paid for them). You'll be really sorry if you have to make any returns so just wanted to give a warning!
3,Run a little narrow,"I really like sketcher's shoes and never had a problem with them. I guess by the word ""sport"" in the title I should have realized these run very narrow - even in the wide width. I wear an E width and even the E was too narrow - I had to order a size larger so there is shoe hanging off the back of my heel but at least my feet feel WONDERFUL! It's well worth it if you get the size too narrow to go back and get a larger size. These shoes are amazing and shoemall's return policy is quite easy to work through."
5,Fun shoes,Recovering from a broken ankle requires shoes that have cushioning and arch support. Usually this type of shoe is on the ugly side. These mules are great looking and fill the requirements. I love them!
5,Totally Awesome slip ons!,"These are hands down the best looking slip on sneakers around. Great price, great style and feel. Just wish amazon had more sizes available."
3,"Comfortable, but don't stay together","Love this style of shoe! The mule is great for me. I don't like to have my foot closed in and open toes and playground gravel don't mix. This shoe is comfortable and formed well to my foot. However, I don't appreciate that with only about 2 months since I purchased the shoe, the 'toe guard' rubber part is already separating from the toe of the shoe. I don't wear these every day and most days that I do wear them are spent inside, so they haven't be excessively wet."
1,Junk created by people who don't care,"Within 2 weeks of purchasing these, the little ""eyes"" started falling off. On closer examination, it was clear they were poorly made (and I see I'm not the only person who's had this issue with them). When I contacted Skechers, all I got was a runaround and a typical ""we're a big, wealthy corporation - who the heck are you?"" response. Skechers so-called customer service personnel couldn't have cared less. Run away from Skechers products, but don't do it in these shoes."
5,Most comfortable shoes ever,"I had heel surgery 3 years ago and started wearing the Skecher Bright Eyes. They were the ONLY shoe I could wear for over a year and now I wear some of the dressier Skechers for church, etc. I wish Skechers could make a dressier shoe that is the EXACT construction of the Bright Eyes. I love them.Mary CannetteThurmont, MD"
4,Lullabies about spiders! Oh my!,"I didn't appreciate the song ""Lullaby"" as much as I should have until after listening to this single. There are two re-mixes of ""Lullaby"" on this disc -- ""remix"" and ""extended remix."" I thought they were better than the album version. There are also two live songs on this single: ""homesick"" and ""untitled."" They have a very clean sound and are comparable to their album counterparts. Overall, I would recommend this disc if you are interested in a longer remixes of ""Lullaby,"" as the live songs are really not that much different."
4,En buen estado!,"El disco me llego muy rapido! esta en buen estado y lo pague en buen precio, muy atento el vendedor a la hora del empaque! muchas gracias por el disco!! muy conforme!"
5,More than i was waiting for,"I gave this DVD as a birthday gift to my brother, we're huge Charlatans fans and the DTS sound feels incredible. Excellent choice if you want to get introduced to this marvellous band"
4,They have won some new hearts with this!,"I was at the Gene Loves Jezebel and Mission UK concert on Oct 23, and I had never heard GLJ before. This album was handed out to attending fans, & I just took it on the way in. I was Surprised at the concert, I liked what I Heard, I took it home, I listened to the album, & I liked it too. I am now going to check out some of their older stuff, because I think I may have missed something really good!"
4,Soul filling songs.,"What a surpride to hear that GLJ has a new album. There are three old songs here from previous releases; ""Love Keeps Dragging Me Down"", Who Wants to go to Heaven?"", and ""When We Were One"". The remakes of these songs are a real nice touch to previously spectacular songs. This album is Gene at their finest. Songs like Liquor Man and Welcome to LA are as good and inventive as rock can get. It's a shame no big label has exploited the market with these guys and all their talent. They could rake in millions. These songs are at a level much higher then the mediocrity of stuff being played on radio these days and selling millions. Every Gene album is a phenom. This album (VII) is pure Gene with rocking songs, heart felt ballads, amazing inventiveness, and the finest voice on the planet."
2,Not as good as their other cd's,"I've been a long time Gene Loves Gezebel fan and picked up this recent release and I gotta tell you I really didn't like it too much. All the songs are very very slow and just don't do anything for me. I'm very dissappointed. As a frame of reference, I absolutely love the Heavenly Bodies and the Kiss of Life cd's. I love the lead singer's voice but the songs on this album do not suit him well. Hopefully their next cd is better..."
3,"Ooh, What's That Smell?","Oh, yeah, I smell dead people. So we sort of agree for a change--this isn't Jay's best album, but ""Welcome to LA"" still beats the hell out of anything from Giving Up the Toast all by itself."
1,Skip this one,"Skip over this cd, spend your money on ""Love Lies Bleeding"" or ""Giving Up The Ghost"" or ""Exploding Girls"" instead. If you already have these albums, good for you, then check out Syd Barrett instead.The songwriting is weak, the vocals are weak, the band is weak. This album is really the band's poorest effort to date."
1,Yuech!,"This is an insult and an illustration of what ruined a wonderful band. The songs are B L A N D! Vocally as DULL as it can be, SHEESH! LOVE KEEPS DRAGGIN ME/us all DOWN!This is dreadful, it really is a shame that this tuneless, toneless joker continues to sully and SHAME and further CHEAPEN the once great name.If you love G.L.J. buy LOVE LIES BLEEDING! WE can clearly see why IMMIGRANT, PROMISE and much of DISCOVER was GREAT and H.B. and V11 is so GOWDawful. These jokers should be hung, drawn and slaughtered for destroying a thing of Beauty!Oh' and the sleeve is putrid!A V O I D at ALL COSTS!"
4,Pretty good,"I like this small trash cymbal. It has a quick tight trashy sound that is very similar to a cat aggressively knock over a garbage can. (I mean that in a good way). While their other non-China cymbals suck spectacularly, this is actually really good for the price and sound."
5,Turnaround Vitality,"Wow! Do I wish I had had this book sooner. I am into my fourth year as a pastor in a church that was going nowhere. This book has shown me how difficult the process of turnaround is and how long it takes. I have recently had a ""vote of confidence"" because a number of people wanted the church to go back to what it had been in the past. Fortunately, they did not have the numbers to bring me down. God has been doing some incredible things here recently. I am not a young pastor or inexperienced. Alright, I am 62 with a lot of years of ministry behind me. But I have been accused of things that just weren't true. Now I can see some of the motivations of the accusers. Some have left the church which is a shame. But it is still God's church. Thanks, Gene Wood, for writing this helpful volume."
1,Still have fleas,"I sat on the couch 3 feet away from where I set off the bomb several hours ago, and big fleas are jumping on me! I followed the instructions to the letter. Maybe it takes longer for them to die off, but they sure seem healthier than ever right now. How disappointing. Cost about $20. I treid carpet powder too. Maybe I've got extra tough fleas."
4,Essays in light (heartedness),"It's good to get in touch with Crowley's sense of humor. This nice red little book contains 4 very different symbolically charged stories. It doesn't take itself too seriously and pokes fun at a lot of things in a wry, cynical way that is not disillusioned. It's a quick read and I'll read it again."
1,Not best for your pet,"I bought this cage and I was very disappointed. It took over an hour to put together. My six pound rabbit barely fit and it was cumbersome for him to go up and down the ramp. I also didn't think about the wire bottoms. He is completely litter box trained and doesn't need the wire bottoms. So I had to put carpet squares on the floor so the wire wouldn't hurt his feet. After about a month, I broke down and bought ""My Deluxe Home, Giant"" from [...]. It costs about the same as this one but it is one level with lots of room for him to stretch out. It only took about 10 minutes to put it together. I have had it for over a year and it still looks like new."
1,Not worth the money,"This is not worth $75 plus $40 shipping and handling!!! Cage is so flimsy and unless you have a baby rabbit don't think about it. The ramp is not even wide enough nor sturdy enough for a half grown or full grown rabbit to go down. Ramp and the upper tier won't even support the weight of our rabbit. It can't even go up the ramp, too narrow. Very cheap looking and some of the covers that go over the bare wire were missing, box was not damanged at all but all the wire sides were bent. Was going to send it back but they want a 15 % fee just to send it back, plus paying for postage again....I'll be in the hole nearly. This was a total waste of $115.00!!! Looks much better in the picture, wire is very thin. Buyer beware."
3,Not a fast duplicator,"I recently purchased this and used it to make about 30 copies of a disc. It was pretty slow on the fasted setting. My computer can burn the disc faster. However, it did eventually get the job done."
4,Smaller than expected,"The basket was smaller than I expected, but my out-of-state family LOVES the goodies. So far, they say everything has tasted wonderful."
1,All that glitters is not gold,"What a letdown!!! I had this hamper shipped to my wife and daughter in Seattle, as we could not be together for Christmas.The first reaction was one of delight, it LOOKED magnificent. Upon closer inspection they found it was 90% wrapping, and 10% product. The disappointment was huge! What a rip off. I am usually very pleased with Amazon and their partners, but this is one that definitely needs to be looked at!! That definitely spoiled our Christmas!!!"
3,Belated Bellow,"As one of the contributors to this collection of essays, I wish to point out that the quality of individual essays is uneven. There was a delay of several years in the publication of this volume, owing to a number of mysterious circumstances. Even after waiting for years and contacting AMS Press and the editors at Georgia State University, I have not been able to obtain my copy of the book, and have had to rely on a library copy. The experience has been unprofessional and disappointing to say the least."
1,The worst video ever,"Boring !Poor sound - horrific sound !The Capoeirista seems to get tired and running out of breath after first 5 min.No explanations !No flow !The REAL capoeira clips are teasingly annoying !No substance, no goal, no pace, NOTHING !It took Amazon 2 months to deliver ! And it was shipped from So Cal to So Cal, no more than 50 miles away...The worst video (instructional or entertainment or anything) ever !Too bad there's no option less than one star for the rating !!!"
1,Total Rip-Off,"I was dumb enough to buy the VHS copies of these years ago for megabucks. I have hundreds of workout videos. These shouldn't even be categorized as ""workout"" videos. There is no cuing, no instruction, no routines, nothing. Just the lady swaying around and smiling in her living room, and the occasional clips of real capoeira artists. I can't believe these are still on the market and still being hawked as ""workout videos"" !"
1,"No, this is not good","Clumsy text, amateurish pictures. Go to your library and get some really good books for your kids."
4,Great collection!,"We had a ball watching this one! Since so many reviews have already broken down the individual shorts I will just make one comment about ""Cooking Terms:"" How does a 1950s woman grow up without knowing what ""boiling"" means? And as the Crew comments, should this person really be cooking at all?Lots of laughs in this one!"
1,Worst service ever,"I ordered this a month ago and still haven't received it. I contacted their ""customer service"" (hah, what a joke) and they kept putting me off saying give it more time/ my post office was probably holding it. The DHL tracking number they gave didn't work. Finally after 3 weeks, they agreed to re-ship. That was a week ago and I still don't have it, despite telling them NOT to re-ship via DHL/ USPS. (I even paid double postage seeing that I bought another item from them and didn't ask for the postage to be reduced. You'd think they could have sent it Priority Mail, but no.) All I know is that I have an autistic son who has a meltdown EVERY DAY because it's not here. (The new DHL tracking number says it's been stuck in Kentucky for the past 3 days.)Don't order from these people if you actually want to receive your item. They deserve ZERO stars for a rating."
4,My Hero,As in My Hero I always love a book exploring the many facets of each persons personalities. It is always good to see people grow as individuals and as a couple. Love is always good.
3,A Manual for Romance Writers,"This book has a lot to say about the process of writing romance, especially choosing characterisitics of the hero. But the plot has no substance and the characters have no depth. The hero isn't a believable character."
1,My Hero,This book is a a previoulsy published book under another title. I think the publisher should have to republished it under the same name. I purchased this book thinking it was a new book by Debbie Macomber but after I purchased it I found out I had already read it under another title. I like the author Debbie Macomber but this is not the first time one of her books was republished under another name.
4,MY HERO,I thought this book had a very fast story line. Not one area where the story dragged. I read the book in one evening.
1,My Hero,"Did not realize it was a religious story. Just too much! I believe in God but I had to force myself to finish it. I learned a good lesson, ALWAYS read some of it before purchasing it."
2,Less than riveting,I've read several Debbie Macomber books and this was not one of her better ones. It was cute but not very exciting
4,used book,"I got the book very soon and it was exactly as good as espected, even if it was used. great service."
3,"Decent contact mic, worthless mini Mic","I received this product new with the mini Mic not soldered onto the 1/4"" jack. The customer support from Fishman was so difficult to deal with regarding this problem I had to pay a Fishman 3rd party repair person to fix the problem.That said, the contact mic is decent but the mini Mic is practically useless and picks up almost no sound. A good contact mic and good preamp work just as well. I've used this pickup for classical, jazz, and rock styles- the contact mic helps when playing with drums or other loud instruments, but a functioning mini Mic would have made this product good for solo work as well."
5,Great Reference Book for the price!,"This book is tiny but full of little pictures that make it an even better reference guide. If you are looking for color pictures, detailed information and/or illustrated examples in culture then this is NOT the book for you."
4,"The Herder Dictionary of Symbols: Symbols from Art, Archaeology, Mythology, Literature, and Religion",This book has been very good resource for some art work that I am producing.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Quigley rules! OK, disclaimer, I went to HS with the guy BUT I'm also a crossword fan & his are the best, ""classic yet modern"" as Will Shortz writes in the intro .... challenging but do-able (like my last girlfriend!)"
2,Do not buy these CD's,"Do not purchase any Yamaha blank media. After about 2 months after I had recorded audio on one of the cd's, the undercoating started to chip and no longer worked. I had to throw the CD away. I'm afraid this is going to happen to all my Yamaha recorded CD's."
3,DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE!,"This movie was scary, but not the scariest. The begining was the scariest part."
1,bet its great if you could see it,"this was my 3rd rifftrax order....the disc is a dead stick....after ordering it i noticed that there were a host of complaints about freezes and dropouts. it's true...you can't get anything to play properly. i was dissapointed, but even more so in the return policy....it seems that if you remove the cheap plastic wrapper, you de-value the damaged disc by 50%.....wow, you'd think folks would stop selling broken things in the first place, but it'd be nice to see them stand behind the product......the worlds changing....erichl5"
1,Unhappy Customer,MY DVD IS DAMAGED...Every chapter skips. I am an extremely busy person so I cant take the time to do the return protocol for a 10 dollar DVD. Sucks cuz I really enjoy these Rifftrax DVDs.
1,Defective product,"I tried to watch this dvd, but it wouldn't play on either of my two players. I'll be keeping this in mind the next time I'm deciding whether or not I want to buy from Amazon."
5,Great product,This is on ebay so I decided to give it a try. As you can see by the pics it comes apart for easy cleaning. The coffee tastes good. Not that plastic taste you read about on other brands. My son got my other model I write about which was different. I like the clear look so you can see the water level. It gets the coffee hot. You can brew for different amounts of coffee. Convenient. It`s easy to fill with water. I`ll keep this updated as time goes on. Doesn`t leak like other brands. Good durable quality. I suspect those other brands will copy this. At least they should. Auto shut off is nice. No messy glass carafe to break or clean.
4,A creative blending of concepts,"While I'm not convinced by these materials that yoga was the genesis of all martial arts, the author does make a compelling case that yoga techniques can complement martial training. The routines described herein can help improve body control, balance, flexibility, and strength. Not surprising since many of these techniques are already found in most traditional martial arts training.There's really nothing earth shattering in here, but there is some good stuff that can help you become a better martial artist if you add it to your daily routine. It's pretty well written and easy to follow, an interesting and creative blending of concepts not generally associated with each other. On the other hand, I certainly would not consider it a ""must read"" by any means.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
3,Good - but not Great,"This is a good, but not great explanation of how yoga benefits a martial artist. Since a martial artist is about power, speed, balance, a bit more explanation of the kinetics would have been appreciated.I've been studying karate for a while and yoga for longer, I know my personal yoga practice complements my karate. However, I don't know all the kinesthetics for why.I am going to keep looking for a book that explains the why to me so that I can explain the why to my fellow karatekas."
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this fingertip towel because I already had the shower curtain. I haven't put it out because it is silly looking. For one thing, the decorated portion is heavy and thick, and the disproportionately small towel part is comparatively thin. Heavy, bulky embellishment on a slight, skimpy towel. The towel part would have to be longer or the embellishment cut in half to make it look right."
5,Warne makes great products.,"This is the second set of rings I've bought from Warne and have one picatiny base. Installed on .30-06 and .300 Win Mag, these are very well machined and strong pieces of aluminum. The powder coating is strong and doesn't chip. Uses standard torx screws to hold it in place, so no new tools necessary, plus they provide a small wrench with the rings. I've beaten my rifles, dropped them, and had them bounce around the jeep/atv, and these mounts have kept the scope in place and retained zero. Good products."
5,happy,everyone should have this special edition of the original 1993 power rangers megazord. the black and goldish features are beautiful and blends even better with the green dragonzord.
4,Very good Book,For any one interested in tying any of Bob Clouser's flies this is the perfect book. The hints contained in this book allowed me to tie much better flies
5,Clousers Done Right,"I fish specs and reds in the flats, and when I'm not throwing top water, I'm using a Clouser...this book has led me to experiment with other than the Clouser standards with great success. The book is well written and the photography of the flies is superb. Glad I added it to my fly library, it certainly will be a classic."
4,fly tying,"Great resource from a very talented author. Very helpful photos & tying steps in expanded sequence, all make for exciting outcomes in fly tying & angling. jbw"
2,Worse-than average pop in Spanish from the singer of Sentimiento Muerto,"It had been a while since the legendary Venezuelan rock band, Sentimiento Muerto, had been dissolved, when the band's former frontman, Pablo Dagnino, decided to go solo. Expectations were high, considering the outstanding work the band did and the longstanding fan base they developed, but ""Biorritmos"" was not up to the challenge. The resulting album was a bland pop production that didn't sound any different from the other artists that were topping the Venezuelan charts at the time (Pedro Castillo, who played guitars in the album, being one of the most famous ones). As a result, this album went mostly unnoticed and became an effort that most hardcore Venezuelan rock fans became dissapointed with.Dagnino later went on to form the band Pixel with former members of other famous Venezuelan bands. They've recorded two albums to this day, none of which I've had a chance to listen to. I can just recommend you to skip this solo mistake."
4,Very good holster,"I would have given this holster 5 stars, but it arrived with a small flaw on the bend of the holster. This fits my Taurus PT1911 perfectly. It has a good draw from the excellent canted angle.The best part was this holster is priced at half the price of very similar products! I recommend this 1911 holster."
4,Good leather holster,Received very quick good strong leather and sturdy snap. I don't know what else to say about this product. Good product
3,Overtly educational,"Our daughter (20 months) will sit and watch it, but she doesn't enjoy it as much as the Baby Einstein DVD's. It is more overtly educational than BE, so she may enjoy more when she is a little older and she understands a little more."
1,Boring Baby,"Wow. Dad, Mom, Baby, none of us can get interested in this video.We bought this to try and help encourage talking, but not only doesn't it do that, it doesn't even hold anyone's attention.If you like watching a mom sing off-key to her child because you can't be bothered to sing to your child yourself, then maybe this is for you.Save your money for Baby Babble dvds instead."
2,"It""s okay...","It doesn't keep the attention of my 2 year old, although I know every child is different.I also purchased the ""LET'S TALK WITH PUPPY DOG"" series for him when he was much younger. He loved the baby phonics. Once he could say all the words, I put another of the 7 dvds on for him. He can watch it... LITERALLY, for 4 hours straight if you let him!!!!(It's annoying to the parent, but he is really learning. His colors, letters and words are getting clearer)"
4,Brainy Baby - Laugh & Learn,"I gave this 4 stars simply because it's a Brainy Baby DVD and I expect to love it as much as I do others when my son gets a little older. My 13mos old son absolutely loves and is oddly mesmorized by the Brainy Baby - Right Brain, but this one he didn't seem to be too interested in after about 10 minutes. I still love the Brainy Baby line and will try him again with it when he is a few months older."
5,OMG! I AM SO HAPPY!,"MY NAME IS DONESHA,AND MY WONDERFUL MOM JUST ORDERED THIS TOY FOR ME TODAY!I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT!IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT,BUT I'M PROBABLY GONNA GET A SNEAK PEEK WHEN MY MOM'S NOT LOOKIN'. ANYWAY I'M SOOOOOOOO GONNA LOVE THIS TOY!!!!!!!THANKS FOR YOUR TIME!!!!!!!"
2,bad choice,"I bought this TV about 6 months ago. The DVD player never worked, there is always an anoying noise coming out from the speakers. Not happy at all."
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this item and hooked it up and it was fine. I never used the TV because it was a guest room TV. The first time it was used again there was no color on the TV. It is now in the shop and I will have to pay labor charges to have it fixed. However after 30 days the service people have failed to send parts to the shop for repair. I can't speak to anyone at the main ( audiovox/jensen) number to complain because their phone set up is awful and disconnects or sends you to the wrong department. I do not recommend this TV and have big doubts about the warranty service they offer as well.
5,Wheels of Gold,This book details every aspect of starting a limousine business. I can't beleive he would share this much information but I'm glad he did! A step-by-step guide to what works and what doesn't. The book is an excellent reference which will be used in my business for years to come. Well worth it!
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this book. For the price of a paperback, I would have expected more depth. It reads like a beginner's outline for starting a business without detailed information. I would describe this book more of a 'what links and sites to visit if you know nothing of starting a business.' Would not recommend it at all."
3,"Interesting, short read. Meh.","This book is very interesting, and it's a pretty quick read. However, I wonder about this guy's education, because the book is rife with misspellings and typos. (If he misspells ""warranty"" one more time, I will burn this book!!!!!!)As it was last revised in 2006, this book is also getting quite out of date. Pagers are no longer found, Mapquest isn't used for navigation anymore, etc.It definitely does not go into the detail you need to start your own business. Also, many of the suggestions he makes seem quite silly. For example, he advises that beginners in the business who have no cash can start a business having chauffeurs drive people in the customer's personal vehicle. This can have all kinds of negative insurance implications that are not even hinted at in the book."
3,Not quite what it says it is.,"This book is a good starter book for someone who knows little about the industry but lacks the depths and specifics necessary to make it all really work. I am beginning my business now, so I am ""living it"". It is worth a look just to get some basic ideas of what to do and where to look (online) to start to get the more in depth information necessary to really be successful. There are also a few ambiguities, such as (paraphrasing) ""dont drive your limo for personal use"" and then ""you should only own 4 door sedans personally - it is a perk of this business"" Huh??If your interested in this business, you might give it a look, but DONT stop here."
3,Maybe not gold just silver,The book is a basic how to book most of which is common sense.As I'm am starting a Limousine business I thought it would be helpfull but nothing I didn't know after an hour on line
5,Terrific book!,"""Wheels of Gold"" is a terrific book--a must read for anyone who wants to start a limo business! It is easy to read, comprehensive, and full of valuable advise based on experience. My congratulations to Mr. Goerl!"
5,This Book is a Must for Anyone Who Lives Poetry,"This book addresses the various aspects of poetry, as well as what makes a good poem. It presents attempts at defining poetry.The reader is provided with poems by a broad selections of poets, with the date of the poem and a succinct anecdote about the poet.Best of all, there are questions that guide the reader to reasonably interpret the poems. This is helpful to the novice or to the expert.I would certainly recommend this concise, yet highly valuable and detailed book about reading poetry. It will lead you to truly understand the poems presented and to develop the skills to read any poem.Poetry affords us with crisp and detailed accounts of our historical and immediate world. The imagery and other poetic techniques enhance our understanding of ourselves and others.So, go for it. Read this book! View the world with a sharper lens. Express yourself so another can relive your experiences through your words."
5,Great for All Ages,"This is a wonderful film that entertains our 6 and 4 year old granddaughters, and had all the adults captivated as well. It can be watched more than once - an important feature with little ones - and still be enjoyed. There are some scary moments, but nothing overwhelming - It is a safe PG.Pay attention to the small details as that is where much of the subtle and not so subtle humor lies.A lot of fun, and well worth more than one viewing"
4,Good movie,"I'm not completely certain, but I am fairly certain that the same guys who made Wallace & Gromit are the same who made Flushed Away. So, I had some high hopes for Flushed Away, since I am a fan of W&G. And, lemme tell ya, Flushed Away didn't disappoint me. It was truly funny, and the plot was quite ridiculous in a very good way. A pretty great movie that I'd recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,"Awesome, and funny!","I jus watched this film from the producers of ""Wallace and Gromet"" and ""Chicken Run"" and I truely enjoyed it, as well as my wife... This is an awesome film that made me laugh all the way through... I can't recommend it enough... Truely a must see film for everyone!"
5,Flushed Away DVD,"The DVD arrived in amazing time. It was in the condition stated, and I will do business again with this person."
5,GREAT FUN!,"This is a great movie. We are PIXAR fanatics so this is not quite up to par with any PIXAR movies; however, it is still a very good movie. Our four (4) year old girl likes it a lot."
4,Fun adventure for all!,"Fun adventure for all! Flushed Away is delightfully given voice by a stellar cast including Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet and Sir Ian MacKellan, so the characters really come to life and you care about them! Some of my favorites include the singing, screaming slugs in the sewers - hysterical! I rank this movie right up there with Chicken Run, Finding Nemo and other animated greats made for everyone to enjoy! The animation by Aardman/Nick Park is once again really up to snuff. This is a great movie to add to your collection - I did!"
4,Flushed Away,his was very cute and some great one-liners in it. We do not have access to tv chanels so dvd's are our only viewing capabilities. We chuckle all the way throught the movie.
5,Family Fun..,I bought this movie for my 5 year old son a couple of weeks ago.. We watched it together and neither one of us could not stop laughing.. It has great youth humor as well as good adult humor .. I would recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor..
5,a good movie,"This Movie was absolutly adorable, I actually sat down & watched it w/ my 3 yr. old son, We both enjoyed it,"
4,Cute...,"Another animated movie. I love em. But there have been better ones. Although this one wasnt that bad...it was actually pretty cool.So movie is about a rodent (Roddy) who lives in ""mansion"" and gets flushed down the toilet. Once in the sewage, he meets other rodents and an evil toad who is trying to wash away the ""city"". His mission, along with a female rodent (Rita), is to get Roddy back home while keeping the evil toad from doing harm.Good accents, made it a little more interesting. A cute plot. Teaches a very short lesson at the end. Funny at times. No real boring parts.An overall good film. Recommended if you like animated films."
5,Cute animation,"Wonderful animation movie with cute songs, adorable critters and sweet characters. A privileged pet rat gets flushed by an unwanted, rude guest (another rat from the sewers) and is sent into a world far different than his pampered cage. He struggles to get back 'up top' to his old home and easy lifestyle. However, a rich rat discovers that his cushy life is pretty empty without friends and family and must decide if they are better than clean cages and cuisine. Delightful family entertainment!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Clay,"This bit of British style humor works very well in this movie. Though it looks like the claymation style of Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit, it was in fact done by computers and it shows through terrific visual effects. The story of a pampered above ground rat that gets flushed down the toilet to the sewers below is the typical fish out of water tale, but done well. At 84 minutes, the action is fast and furious and my [...] was entertained the entire time. The slugs were really funny, and there was a whole lot of groin shots throughout the movie. I found the dvd to be a terrific copy and filled with lots of entertaining extras. Great for the kids and entertaining enough for the adults."
3,average,"My husband and I thought this movie was pretty average and very forgettable. I did not really like any of the characters, nor did I find them interesting. The plot was very weak and bored me. It got a little better towards the end, but only slightly so. Perhaps young kids will enjoy it more. There was a lot of slapstick humor that I'm sure they would appreciate a lot more than I, or my husband, did."
5,Lots of Fun for all ages!,"My boys are 3 and 5. I watched this first to preview it, and although some of the humor was a little above their heads (and they use the word ""idiot"" a few more times than I'm comfortable with), I chose to let them watch it. They loved it! So much so that we had to buy a copy. I've seen it now more than 1/2 dozen times and it's still funny for me - as well as for them. (Fortunately ""idiot"" hasn't shown up in our house, but I've been pro-active in discussing appropriate vs. inappropriate language.) It's fun, fast-paced and even kept my 3 year old entertained ... which doesn't happen with most movies. The message about home, friends and family is a good one. Noone gets hurt - not even the hench-rats - there's a happy ending and unlike most Disney movies, no parents were killed to propel the plot forward which was refreshing. I enjoyed this so much I bought the CD soundtrack."
2,Kind-of funny,"This movie was moderately funny, its probably to slow for children to stick with. Slightly rude and crude humor on some parts but not to bad. I never finished watching it and that's rare for me.Family friendly- 4 out of 5Humor - 2 out of 5plot - 3 out of 5 (for originality)"
4,"Another good dreamworks film, funny, famuly, more for older kids.","I really enjoy the dreamworks films, most recently Over the Hedge and now this. This is a funny perspective of what happens when the family's small pets get flushed down the toilet. Also a story that reminds us money can't buy true happinesss. The overall plot is a variation of many other tales, rich person with everything but no family or love gets removed from their environment, finds and unexpecting person who has a family, falls for them and their family, sacrifices their wealthy way of life for the true love and family. But this is entertaining, and the slugs are actually funny additions. Agian, some of the humor is crude, how many groins hits can you fit into a movie, at least 3 different characters get hit in the groin. For that reason, i think this film is best suited for kids around 10 or above. Its a good film, great addition to the collection, check it out."
3,"Good For Children, A Bit Boring For Adults.","""Flushed Away"" is the story of a sophisticated pet rat who gets flushed down the toilet and discovers that there is a whole rat universe below the ground. It takes place in what is supposed to be a london-esque rat city. There is love, adventure and comedy all wrapped up into the plot. Although I do think that its a good movie for children, its a bit predictable and slow-moving at times for adults. I do suggest letting your child watch the movie.3 out of 5 stars."
3,good entertainment for the kids,i bought this for the kids and they loved the movie i would recommend this if you have children
4,Don't Get Flushed Away....,"Very cute movie for children and adults alike. This movie has a lot of funny humor that adults may only get and lots of fun music sung throughout the movie by various creatures!!Best part of the film are the characters, storyline & Rita, the leading lady of this film (Kate Winslet is the voice of Rita), who is a true role model for all girls as she doesn't need to be saved by any man and she even manages to save the leading man, Roddy, in this film!!"
5,REALLY GOOD!!!!!,"PLAIN AND SIMPLE THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD AND WELL DONE MOVIE !!!!! I AM REALLY GLAD I PURCHASED IT. GIVE THIS MOVIE A TRY , YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID !!!!!"
4,Another Keeper...,"Flushed away is another winner. It has character, a good story...great laughsand can be viewed multiple times and still enjoy it.Thumbs up."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE!,Finally a really fun movie for kids and adults! I didn't expect much from this movie but wanted to get the kids out of the house for a while. (Plus I'll go see anything with Hugh Jackman in it -- even if I can't see him!) I was surprised to find myself laughing through the entire movie! Great movie! Can't wait to own it!!
4,"Solid Saw, great value!!","I purchased this saw to replace an older 12"" DeWalt saw. I am blown away at the new features. The laser, with a little adjusting, is bright and easy to see, the mitre gauge clear and precise, and the compound setting is rock solid at the front of the saw. No more reaching to the back to adjust the tilt, hooray. This saw is heavy, and I recommend it for the serious home improvement person, or would be great for a trim carpenter relying on quality tools for a quality job. The saw came ready to use, with a good 12"" carbide tipped blade."
5,Too good !,This saw is so good that I had to post a review.It is extremely accurate and very powerful! I built a whole deck with it this summer. I am also using in all the home theater projects I am taking up now.The twin lasers are a godsend...actually those are a MUST. DONT accept anything lesser. Also make sure that the laser beams are adjustable (this one's are) Lastly the electric brake saves time.Overall I'd give it 12 out of 10!
5,"John Prin mines common ore of all addictions: ""Secret Keeping""","As an addiction therapist and recovering addict myself and the author of ""Something for Nothing: Shoplifiting Addiction & Recovery"" and ""Biting The Hand That Feeds: The Employee Theft Epidemic,"" I found John Prin's book to be an extremely well-written tale of his own life that anybody should be able to relate to and benefit from. Mr. Prin has distilled the essence of all addictions and self-destructive behaviors to their very fuel: secret keeping. I would encourage anyone to read this book who needs to know the difference between healthy and unhealthy aspects of our private lives. Mr. Prin is onto something here!"
4,Applicable to more than addiction.,"Who in this world doesn't have a secret? This book is relatable on more levels than just addiction. It's about the tenacious journey of a man struggling and finally enjoying the inspirational triumph of breaking free of secrets. It's achingly real and raw, opening the door for others to follow in his footsteps. John Howard Prin does a fantastic job leading us down a road of vulnerability, strength, and triumph.As a postpartum depression survivor, I kept my experience a secret. It was devastating and kept me from connecting with loved ones. Once released, I was finally free to live the life I've always dreamed of living. Secrets have a way of poisoning the spirit - set them free and live your life to the fullest potential!Sincerely,Kelly Nordstrom"
3,"It's OK, but kinda weak...","Not the best from Hoare by any stretch. The book starts slow, I wasn't sure where it was going, and then it dawned on me that it was wrapping up. Not a bad read because it's a primary account of a true event, but I wish it included more details on personal weapons, kit, tactics, etc... Thanks, Jerry"
1,"This book is not very useful, informative, or entertaining.","When I saw this book I was under the impression that I would get a lot of useful information about the Lambretta I was about to purchase. On the contrary, I found a bit of history along with a bunch of old ads. The price tag is a bit much for a book of such low quality. Most of the pages look as though they were created from photo copying images of very poor quality. It does not look to me as though any time or effort was spent in trying to present a quality product. I returned my copy."
5,Pearl Harbour's best album ever !!!!!,"You can't go wrong with Pearl's ""Here comes trouble"" ! It rocks from start to finish with no filler. Great singing from Pearl and fabulous playing from her top notch band. This is her definitive album. I don't know why this album wasn't a hit on the radio ?! It's ready made for it in all the right ways. I sure wished that she would record a brand new album. Pearl, where ever you are please record a new album and return to playing live again."
3,A Little Lightweight,"If you are a Mark Isham fan, you might want to seek this CD out, for Isham plays on several cuts, and the general musical mood of the CD is much like that of a Mark Isham CD. The late Gil Evans also played on a few cuts (for me, that is no plus, but there are probably some Gil Evans fans amongst our readership). Guitarist Ray Russell has a varied musical background that includes rock, soul, jazz, and television scoring. Overall, the music on Childscape seems a little lightweight, but if like me you can't get enough of Mark Isham, then you will probably enjoy listening to this. The title cut made my family, who were sitting in the other room, look around curiously to see where the baby noises were coming from. Using the logic espoused by some audio equipment reviewers, that means either the sound quality is really excellent or else my family is kind of gullible."
4,Sam's Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop 6 is an easy read,"The book is very easy to understand. It is written logically and is very comprehensive. It will definitely move you from a beginner to an intermediate or advanced Photoshop User. She uses gray boxes to highlight very helpful techniques based on her experience. My only wish is that she used color illustrations or better pictures to illustrate her ""before"" and ""afters"". Of course color would cost more so there would be a trade off there but overall I say it is a very worthy tool."
4,Great book,Very informative. Taught me a lot. Only complaint are the black and white illustrations. Many of the lessons can't be viewed in black and white so you are left to assume that a change was made.Other than that a great first timers book.
3,Cute.,"The story was...cute. I enjoyed the verbal sparring between Sinclair and Quincy and their blossoming relationship was quite believable. The antics of the secondary characters made for an enjoyable read, as well.However, I soon tired of Jo's ""masquerade"" when it was evident to me only a few chapters in that almost everyone who met her acquaintance saw right through her disguise.A light easy read that most would enjoy."
2,Ending was disappointing,"I don't typically let the reviewers' opinions influence my opinion of a book, but I should have paid attention to these. I agree with the reviewer who indicated that the characters were not well described. I had no picture in my mind as to the main character's appearance. I kept picturing ""Jo"" as Hilary Swank's character in ""Boys Don't Cry""!! Also, the ending was disappointing as well. I agree with the reviewer who indicated that an epilogue was needed. The book left you hanging, and not in a good way. I would skip this book, unless you find it in a second hand store."
4,A Must-Find for Oasis Fans,"Hopefully a day will come when Oasis compiles all of their great B-sides and covers on a two-disc set (maybe even three). Until then, fans would be well advised to track down this single, as no Oasis collection is complete without the unreleased tracks ""Stay Young,"" a great original, and ""Heroes,"" a fantastic, jangling cover of the David Bowie classic. If you dig Oasis, trust me, you won't regret it. Great stuff."
3,Not technically the Episode IV Vader light saber,"Actually, the Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope"") saber was a more literal adaptation of a flash handle with its hardware left intact, and a D-ring attached at the emitter for hanging on the costume belt. In later films (Episode VI, perhaps Episode V), the prop was adorned with more customized, futuristic detailing. (As was Lukes, which had the old calculator LED display replaced with some PC expansion board edging.)The pictured scaled-down replica appears to be the version prepared for Episode Episode III ""The Revenge of the Sith."""
5,a truth revealed,"As a Chinese American, first generation, I understand what it is like to have your history distorted and therefore I am glad to see a history that restores the dignity of Jefferson Davis and the truth of his beliefs. Percival Beacroft, thank you. This work is a gift to American History."
2,Not entirely an honest documentary,"While it's interesting to hear more about the man who led the CSA (while most material is about northern leaders), but some of this is clearly skewed. Three examples:1. The Emancipation Proclamation: This is presented as an empty gesture by Lincoln. It should be understood that Lincoln was afraid of losing the border states.2. The Sherman/Grant/Sheridan strategies of total war weren't presented with any reasoning (destroying the continuing means of making war material, breaking the will of the people, etc).3. The exchange policy that Grant ended was mentioned without mentioning why Grant ended it (black solders would be enslaved and their white officers would be shot).It's an interesting documentary, but there are definitely dishonest representations made."
5,Flat Washer Assortment,I have used these flat washer sets and the beveled washer set to keep around the house for that leaky faucet or shower stem valve. Quality rubber that does not break down. I've had the cheaper washers break down really fast and even faster on the hot water side.The assortment will have a size that will fit your stem valve or faucets.Good quality and nice to keep around.
3,Works fine.,I'm not sure what they think I'm going to say here. These are rubber washers. I took the old ones out of a couple faucets an put in new ones to stop leaks. They do what they are supposed to do. I got the assortment just because I like to have a variety of sizes on hand.
3,Great Bargin But Why ?,"This will be a strange deal I mean ""Curse of Frankenstein"" was Good But why ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" this would have been Great If they had put instead of ""taste"" maybe ""Horror of Dracula"" or ""The Mummy"" I am going to get this only because the case which Holds my Copy of ""Curse of Frankenstein"" is banged up on the inside,the holder for the disk was broken when I first Got it Back in 2003 Great Deal but Could have Been Better"
1,What Was the Point,"""The Curse of Frankenstein"" is The Best of Hammer's Frankenstein Series But Why Pair this with ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" one of the worst in Hammer's Dracula Series now I would Have Got This If instead of ""Taste"" maybe ""Horror of Dracula"" Where's The fun in this"
5,Biological Warfare Primer,"I have read a few books on the topic recently, and this one is short (~150 pages) and concise. Cole gives well documented examples of bio-warfare ""experiments"" conducted within the US on it's own populace as well as in Europe. The best part of the book documents the lawsuit of an American citizen who sued the US over the death of a family member who died from the government flu and lost becuase the court said what the feds were doing were not illegal. How nice. Need a quick reminder that the military and judicial branches of the government are not your friend? Get this book."
1,Paranoid propaganda,"This author is extremely biased and distorts the truth at every opportunity. As a Public Heath Microbiologist, I have first have knowledge on the topic and the subject material to which Mr Cole refers to. The only reason I gave this a star at all was the appendices are not writen but the author and are true. If you want to know about this topic, research the actual documents and read it yourself without his bias. The government bashing has got to stop. It just bad journalism."
5,Kindle~Kindle~Kindle~STOP!!!,"Not all of us have a Kindle but would love to read the books, too. I have a Pandigital Novel and I can't download ANY books because you don't recognize my device. Any suggestions please? TYVM"
4,an addition to their earlier books.,"I am a fan of TAGB books. They offer a comprehensive guide to traditional TKD. This book as aided me greatly as I have advanced from Green to Blue (with Red just a couple of months away, hopefully). There is a great understanding of what is needed and it is written in such a way that it is clear. Too many books are not clear with text and rely on their photos. The TAGB books have clear text and good photos. The explanations of the forms could have used more photos though (so buy a book of forms). A great Tae Kwon Do book."
1,"Didn't like the smell, feel, texture or results","I normally have had great luck with Zia products, but was disappointed with this one. It wasn't great to work with in any way and soon became too liquid to be easily usable as a good scrub. I tried this product because I had hoped to improve on the medicinal/peppermint smelling Earth Therapeutics foot scrub, but found this product worse in every way instead.If anybody knows of a great-smelling and effective foot scrub, do tell. Otherwise the Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Cooling Foot Scrub is the best I've found so far."
3,"17"" Owl","Delivered in timely manner. Owl looks good. Seems to slow the birds down, but isn't keeping them away."
3,Alright,"Works for some time; however, when the squirrels and birds get used to it, they wont even notice its presence. It still keeps new animals away though."
1,Bad store,"Only got one,not the six as stated.Sent item back, false advertising. Will not use this store again. A joke!"
1,Doves just laugh,"I have purchased this owl decoy after reading in a forum that it will scare doves. I don't know about your doves but mine are clearly not scared by this 42.5 cm piece of plastic.On the other side, the residents of my condo seems to be a little bit scared by my particular taste in decorations.If you need help with doves: tie some balloons, they will produce noise and doves will go away. I will also recommend Crossman 1377C American Classic Air Pistol"
1,"21"" Owl Decoy",The owl was delivered in timely manner and looks good except one eye is missing. Wasn't loose in the packaging.
3,Doesn't anyone review lenses anymore?,"I just went into Fry's with my CF chip and took some test photos, comparing the Samsung Pro 815 with the Olympus E500 and the two lenses that come in its kit. I had very high expectations of a lens made by Schneider-Kreuznach, but they were dashed by my tests. The Chinese made lens on the Olympus took a very much superior photo to that of the S-K lens on the Samsung. The S-K lens was not very sharp and there was further, noticeable loss of sharpness away from the center. There was also severe pincushioning. The Olympus lens was not perfect - it did exhibit slight vignetting - but sharpness was very much superior to the S-K lens across the frame, photos of those little yellow merchandise signs were square and sharp, and photos taken across the room were brighter and such gave an overall better subjective impression.I was disappointed, because I was really ready to buy this camera. Now I will not and must go back to looking."
5,A great overview,This book is well laid out and explains clearly all the musical notations I've missed by being largely self taught on the piano. It covers everything from terminology to how to write out notes to scales and arpeggios. You can also purchase a CD that helps with ear training. It has a spiral binding which makes it very easy to stay open if you're using it at the piano or on a music stand.
2,"Says Ear Training in the title, but you gotta read the fine print.","THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN THE EAR TRAINING CD's, Regardless of how the title is labeled.If it lists the ear training in the title, it should probably include it in the order, otherwise why list it? Just got it in the mail, for a real good price, but the link is really misleading.I can get any kind of ear training cd anywhere, a book won't train my ear, however. Unless there's some kind of instrument I have yet to encounter hidden between the covers.Giving it a 2, seeing as how I am an idiot for not reading further down to realize this book didn't come with a 5 cent CD to train my ear, however I have access to Google and a keyboard which will allow me to train my ear without the overpriced CD's.However it does have a smooth smooth cover which is nice when I fall asleep on the book from over studying."
5,basic and thorough,"Very basic information, but good for the musician starting from zero. It was required for a college Musicianship class, so obviously the professors like it as well."
3,Inexpensive reference book,"This is a good book to have if you are learning the basics of music theory. I find it a little bit confusing at times because there a lot of information and parts that are could be organized a lot better. I also think they should have the answers to the exercise questions, but they don't. You can't beat the price though. My music teacher explains things pretty well so I only use the book as a reference guide."
3,music book,"book was in said condition however it came a little late. overall, great seller and things happen...thanks for the book"
4,Gains momentum,"Lud-In-The-Mist starts out slow and builds to a fever pitch. Like a lot of books written before the Sixties, it expects you to invest some time and thought into it before it pays off, but if you give it a hundred pages to build, the rest of the book goes fast and furious. Give it that amount of time, and a little thought, and Lud-In-The-Mist will repay your investment with dividends. The older you are, the more you will enjoy it, since the hero is a middle-aged patrician whose life becomes an adventure long after he gives up on adventure as a part of his life.Leaving aside topical issues, Lud-In-The-Mist is as intelligent, well written and detailed as contemporary classics like the works of Dunsany and lesser Tolkien. It well deserves to remain in print. Seek it out and enjoy; you won't regret it."
3,Almost -- But Not Quite,"Mirlees here has some fun with the theme of a late-medeival style society that is fearful of the Realm of Faerie and seeks to suppress its dangerous influence on its citizens. I like what Mirlees was trying to do here. It almost earned a 4-star rating, but I felt disappointed by the ending, which I felt went too far in a certain direction, and thereby damaged the integrity of the story. Still, if you are looking for thoughtful fantasy that is more than a cut above the usual hack-work, this is definitely worth a look."
5,This book deserves to be better-known,"This is a perfect, pastoral fantasy read to take on a picnic (or up in a treehouse), or to enjoy with tea and brandy aloud among friends. It is charming, well-written and grounded in the twisted root of Faerie. Search high and low, but I couldn't find another work of fiction by Mirlees -- I am bereft. Any reader who is more fond of The Hobbit than the trilogy that followed will truly appreciate Lud-in-the Mist."
5,Suffering cats! Toasted cheese!,"This is probably one of the ten finest fantasy novels of the 20th century. The author was a genius. The first half is very funny, then it turns into a murder mystery. The style is wonderful. The fairy fruit does not refer to drugs, it refers to the Dionysian element in life. I loved the names of the characters."
3,Schlesinger claims pivotal role,"Written with an enjoyable facility, this book makes a modest contribution to the intellectual and social history of Schlesinger's time. It would, however, be better--and shorter--if it were not so heavily freighted with the author's huge ego and compulsive name dropping."
5,Delightful Memoir,"Professor Schlesinger's memoir is truly splendid, a well-rounded account of intellectual life in the first half of the 20th century. The New York Review of Books compared it to The Education of Henry Adams, which may be going a little too far. But it is a delightful book recalling a time when public intellectuals had a great impact on national life. I am by no means an unqualified fan of Professor Schlesinger. I agree with Judge Posner's harsh assessment of Professor Schlesinger's defense of President Clinton in ""An Affair of State."" But I found this book delightful. As with all of Professor Schlesinger's work, the style is engaging, and it is fascinating to see the great debates of the 1940's from the viewpoint of someone who was so passionately involved."
3,Interesting book from an interesting man,"Schlesinger writes a book of personal recollections that reads much like a grandfather relating his rich and rewarding life onto his next generation. It is not a hard facts history book, and it will not be remembered as such (regardless of Dr. Kissenger's overly optimistic review on the dust jacket).There are high points and low points to this book. His experiences at Harvard, worn torn Europe, and the ideological battles between communists and liberals over control of the American left were fascinating. However, we are also privy to every movie, play, book, and cocktail dinner that schlesinger ever attended. It's interesting to gain this perspective, but it gets tedious. This book could have used substantial editing.I'm a Schlesinger fan, but I skimmed through many pages. Despite these shortcoming, Schlesinger still imparts his genious."
3,"Good, but not great",It was a little more techno and bland than I expected. I was looking for something that sounded a little more jazzy/brazilian/bossa nova/acid jazz/etc
5,"Excellent, if you don't want details","I read this book, here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book is short, concise, has many B&W; photos and has the basic facts about the Luftwaffe between 1933 and 1945.If you don't want details about Luftwaffe, this book is excellent.If you want details, this book is weak.Don't be fooled.This book is an introduction, to Luftwaffe's history, not a long book, about this subject.This book is an excellent choice, as the first book to read, about Luftwaffe."
3,too large,"This watch is uncomfortably huge; it seems to follow the current trend of ""large is stylish"" but it is too large, too heavy, and too uncomfortable for daily wear and use. Having owned and worn a Seiko dive watch for years, I could not comfortably keep this watch (and wear it) so returned it."
4,Excellent,"This product was delivered just in time and was in excellent conditions. The only thing is that I needed the manual for something and it was not included, I was unable to find it online."
3,Tiny Date Window.,"You need a magnifying glass to read the Date. The Date window is tiny. Otherwise it looks very nice, I am returning it. I want a watch that has a readable date display."
3,Nautica Watch,"I am very fussy when it comes to watches.I really liked the color scheme on the orange chrono and in reality it is just as it looks online.The watch is lovely and has a good weight but I just don't understand how the strap gets dirty so fast.This is really irritating and I'd have considered differently about buying it had i known that the strap would start to lookdirty after 20 min wear. (and that's in the office with a suit on, not outdoor work).if anyone can recommend an effective method of cleaning the strap that would be a good start.great watch, but the strap is a real downside."
4,Nautica Chronograph Watch,Great watch only issue I have is the orange band is hard to keep clean other than that watch its self is pretty good item would most defently recommend it for purchase.
3,"Nice looking,but not strongh enough.",This watch is nice looking in a outdoor activities.But the wrist or pin is not strongh enoughto holding the watch.I loosing the watch went a ride a banana boat.Thats first time me happen with a watch.
2,Disappointed,"Image of the clock does not match the clock ordered...Either way is a good watch ...Try to fix the problem, not to have more people buying the wrong clock."
5,Flashy timepiece,"All I can say about this item is that it is definitively flashy! You will get noticed anywhere with this watch, but it is also really nice, good looking and works great. If you like big, flashy, complex watches, you will love this one. I like it quite a bit. Already considering buying it in blue and black. Shipping was fast and the case is also a beauty. Highly recomend it."
3,Huge Watch! Can be concidered Deadly.,"As I said in my title, the watch is HUGE. Its face is about the size of a credit card. Not the larger distance size of a credit card the smaller. If you look closely at the watch you can see some good details put into the watch and start to appreciate the look of it. Unfortunately from afar, no one else can realize you have anything other then a blotch of orange around your wrist. If you're feeling nice and colorful and want to wear the watch, then its perfect. As for an everyday watch I'd probably look else where. Much better watches out there for this price. Though I can't say I wouldn't recommend it to someone who really digs the color and watch itself. Mechanically the watch seems decent. No problems what so ever in that department."
2,Disappointed,This watch looked amazing on the web but simply didn't live up in person. The face of the watch looked great but the band made it look cheap. I ended up sending back and getting something else.
1,Pruduct is bad,"This product is bad, is not water resistant, buy one, use one week and the first time that I went to a pool damage. and as I live in Colombia, stranded for the devolcion"
2,They sent the wrong product,"They sent the wrong product, I buy one watches Model # 14538G, but I get the # 13530G in the box he had placed a label with the model # 14538G but below that label is the label of the model # 13530G true."
4,Great looking but....,"Nice product but really poor documentation. Instructions are generic and cover numerous watches, but nowhere does it say that you have to unscrew the stem before you can pull it out in order to change the settings. I struggled with it for 15 minutes before I stumbled on the solution."
4,L.Thomas,"I love this watch but the only draw back is, the orange band gets DIRTY and there is nothing that you can clean it w/!!! Remedy.........get a new band!!! But other than that the watch is great so far!! I still have the orig.band on it. I figure that I will wear it and see what the band looks like later during the summer.The wear and dirt may develop it's own look n style....who knows, but if it gets to nasty I will get a new Band!!!!L.ThomasWest Chester,Pa."
2,Watch creates humidity inside when exppse to water,This Nautica watch is suppossed to resist water exposure but when I was on my pool for about a few hours it creates humidity in the central inside part of it. I dont know if it is a manufacture problem but it happens every time its exposed to water.
5,Reminded me of the stories my father told,"I bought this video after the death of my father who was born into a very poor family in northeastern Italy. Watching it was a poignant experience. The hardships of peasant life at the turn of the century are realistically portrayed. Also portrayed are the strong bonds of faith and love that unite a family whatever hardships life may bring. One of the story strands follows a pair of young sweethearts who have become parents in an unusual way by the end of the film. It is enchanting. All in all a moving true to life film that brought tears and smiles as it evoked the memory of the stories Papa told us. American audiences may be impatient with length and slow pace of this film, but it is well worth the time spent."
4,Excellence in detail.,"If you've ever enjoyed hearing stories from Grandpa of his youth in the ""old country"", you will love this film. The word ""movie"" doesn't fit because it's as if you're observing first-hand the lives of these turn-of-the-century peasants, upclose and personal, rather than being entertained or thrilled.So very realistic!!! Just as if you had stepped back in time.Fascinating."
5,A Great Movie Still in it's Orignal Wrapper,"Wonderful to have this marvelous movie to share with family and friends whom I know will appreciate it. IMO, it's a genuine ""classic."" Great service from the seller!"
1,Fragmented boring movie,"I found the movie very boring-not something I would want to watch again. (Unless I suffered insomnia-it's a great sleep inducer, especially if you seen it once before.) I wondered how on earth did it win any movie prize. Fragmented and terribly lengthy (now I seen other movies three hours long and the time went quickly), I found myself wondering what the story was about from time to time. I know overall it was about the oppressive landlord, but going from family to family was confusing to me. I felt sorry for the pig that got slaughtered in the beginning. And the scenes were gorgeous."
2,would not have bought it if seen in real,i bought this product based on some of the reviews from other consumers and have been disappointed with it once received. it is not how i expected it to be.the reason is that each page has a sentence that is translated into 4 different languages but the sentences are not the kind that can be used in daily life...
3,Why all the fuss about Baby Einstein?,"I just don't get all the excitement over Baby Einstein. Though the concept of this book is fantastic: presenting babies and toddlers with exposure to multiple languages in a simple, fun, artful way. However, as with all Baby Einstein products the photos and art in this book are just awful - ridiculously so. Why on earth couldn't the designers have taken the time to use artful, consistent imagery rather than the cheap mish-mosh of pictures they ended up publishing? I would not buy this book again."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I love all the baby einstein videos, cds and toys but I find that the books are not up to par. Language Nursery was by far the worst. It doesnt even begin to intrest my child. Its almost as if they put no effort into the book at all."
1,worst book ever,"Unless you plan on teaching your child 6 languages...do not waste your money. Would have been better if there were one book for English, one book for Spanish, one book for French etc not all in one."
5,One of the best this year.,"There are few compilations you hear over and over again, and this compilation is absolutely one of them. It's not the usual and boring tribal, is very energetic, techy and has all the elements of house music. From Miami to Berlin, from New York to Portugal. This is definitely a ""must have""."
3,"Not great, but maybe not as bad as people say...","Mediocre story, could've been ok if it wasn't for the objectionable interaction between Spawn and Batman. Batman repeatably calls Spawn a punk, but they basically both act like arrogant punks. Batman's personality seems like something of a parody of his Dark Knight Returns self. Lot's of things could've easily been so much better but I still think the book was a decent read through, despite it being very dissapointing in most ways.So why am I giving it three stars? The art. I love it. The panels are simple but beautiful in that special Todd McFarlane way."
2,old and grumpy new and snoby,"wow,this brings back memories.the first time i saw the cover of this book was way back in '94, in batman nightquest days,azrael days.and after nine years ,i managed to get hold of a copy,thanks to amazon.about the book:good art,good coloring,but bad story.the book says it's a companion piece to dc's the dark knight returns. a frank miller story.batman in it has the same feelings as in the dark knight returns, old and grumpy,minus the great story of course.and it's about illegal military weapon experiments with robots,which batman accidentally discovers,and takes him to new york,were he collides with spawn for vigilante methods differences,until the obviuos end. spawn looks great and angry as usual .mcfarlane's art is good.and there is a nice surprise on the last page.but the boring story...for collectors only.p.s can somebody asks dc to print more azrael graphic novels?there is only knight's end knightfall,and the sword"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"An inter-company crossover tale. Batman doesn't like the guy that he meets from the other universe. There's a huge, massive, shocker. After some posturing and much flowing around of cool looking capes they realise they have to take on the crazed supervillain type out to do really, really, bad things.Good capes, not much else."
2,"good art, no story",The characters don't act as they did at that time. The pinups/art are rather nice especially if u compare to the dc verison which as bad as it gets.
4,its better than the other one,"i think that this batman spawn is better than the roanoke one because1.the drwaing and the way spawn acts r a whole lot better2. batman acts more brutal and unforgiving in this one3. the battles between batman and spawn in this one r a whole lot more epic and brutal4. in their second battle in this book batman creams spawn with special gloves, just like batman beat superman in the return of the dark knight and the sequal...i just like this one better"
2,"F. Miller writing Batman? Gotta be good, right? Hell no.","Frank Miller wrote and drew The Dark Knight Returns, possibly the best Batman story ever, maybe the best comic ever. Frank Miller also wrote Batman: Year One, another masterpiece. So why does he occasionally write such generic, unoriginal garbage like this or Sin City? The plot here is like every other superhero team up story, only a bit worse. McFarlane puts out some nice pin ups, but every page is a splash page; he has no sense of pacing or expression in his work. A lot of fighting, bad dialogue, splashy art. Not worth the time it takes to look at the pictures."
4,READ THIS BOOK....PUNK,"OK,the folks who dont like this book just dont get it.This is an in-continuity prequel to millers greatest work of all time THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.Spawn and Bats team up to save the world,but the real joy is in seeing the conflict between Bats and Spawn.Spawn is a ""hero"" who uses the powers of hell to flay and kill people on a regular basis.Guess how Batman reacts?? Spawn is a punk and its about time he learned what it takes to be a man....."
2,Biscotti,"The Biscotti had a good flavor, but all the bars were broken, there was not a single one that was whole. You sent me a second order and all of those were also broken. I think you need a better way of packaging."
4,"A good book, but the maps are a bit off","I used this book for two months traveling around India. The book contains a lot of useful information and covers most of the country, but some of the maps need work. Sometimes they weren't to scale or were not zoomed in enough to be effective. A couple times I found myself in a completely wrong area simply because the maps were bad. That was my only complaint though. Most of the info was accurate, it was well written, and the background info and chapters on culture and religion were more than adequate."
2,Overrated! A big disappointment,"After using over 10 Lonely Planet books to travel Asia and Latin America, I thought I'd give this book a shot since many people had praised it. I was very disappointed. The maps, the background information, and the writing are just BLAND, BLAND, BLAND. Lonely Planet is still king if you want interesting, informative information with highly detailed maps. Concerning Inda, it's best to buy either LP's Northern India or Southern India in separate editions- one book just can't do justice to a country as large and diverse as India."
3,kindle version disappointing,"The Rough Guides are a great alternative to the Lonely Planet.But the kindle version is almost completely useless. The maps are unusable, and that is what a guidebook is for.The images, another enticing part of guide books, were also missing.So, I tried to read the maps on my iPhone. Also useless. They were all too low resolution to read street names or monuments. While the idea of a kindle version of a 1000 page book is appealing (especially if one is traveling light and on the road), I found this a ridiculous adaption for the kindle reader. Completely useless."
2,the rough guide hates india,"who ever wrote the rough guide to India obviously didnt have a very good time. almost every section is prefaced with ""try to get out of this area as soon as possible, but if you have to stay here are some places you can get some bread and coffee."" its down on most every city and only has a couple of places it can bring itself to recommend.i never had any problem with any of the hotel or restaurant information but having that book was like having a whiny friend along who wanted to go home. it became a joke at the end every time we consulted the book on a new city and it had a mopey description.i left mine on the table at the YMCA in Delhi on purpose.ps do not eat the dahl at the ymca in delhi."
2,Lot of historical information but not practical,"I just finshed my trip around India and I must say I had to leave aside my guide during most of my trip. My friend have bought the LP guide instead and we had to use his as RG is full of historical data and food tips but there are many gaps that does not make it a practical guide for India. I found several times for isolated town that they recommend just flying there although LP specify other ways to get there. Every site in RG seems like you must dedicate hours to see while sometimes it is not worth it, I personally liked so much better the organization of LP and how practical it is. If you don't have time to waste by having to read 20 pages to figure out how to get from one point to the other buy LP instead of this one."
2,Could have been great!,"This book contains wonderful black and white patterns for detailed wildlife -- but, except for Canada Geese, gives no hint of their coloring (much less a picture), which defeats the purpose for most artists. This book could easily have been awesome instead of mediocre."
3,wildlife designs for prygraphy,i thought the patterns were drawn good but the shadeing could of been better for wood burning.
4,Excellent background as well as combat material,"Like the title explains, this book offers commentary from various echelons in the German Air Force on the planning and production of fighters and bombers, the deployment and assignments, the policy, the conflicts and the strategic misuse of this vital branch of the military. As well, the author gives a great deal of background on the manufacturers, the competition for the new air speed record, the celebrated pilots who tested the new marvels, the hardships of restricted supply, the motives and explanations of the awarding of production contracts, and many more insights into the German Luftwaffe from its inception, and from the ground up. While a little too technical in naming every formation and an insistence on listing every make and model of plane for every sortie, this book has a lot of valuable information on the German military apparatus, specifically the air arm."
4,An excellent account of the Luftwaffe from the German side.,"A very interesting book that offers excellent insight into the German strategy in all aspects of the Luftwaffe's battle's during WWII. This book cover's the whole spectrum of Luftwaffe units; from the classic fighter and bomber squadron's, to the Paratroop Division's, to the 88mm Flak units accompanying the Wehrmacht, to the Armored/Mechanized units like the Hermann Goring Division.The Luftwaffe War Diaries is a well balanced book that discusses strategic planning of the war at the highest level, including production planning, but also has many highly interesting tales of personal heroism and gallantry.A must read for any historian."
2,dry narrative lacking references...,"This book has many quotes, numbers, etc. but very few references to back them up. The author may say something like so-and-so said this but no references are provided. Even overlooking this problem, the narrative is dry."
5,Original...and Patricia.,"Mad Sin has made many CDs. Each one becoming better and better, when ""Survival of the Sickest"" came out, you thought it couldnt get any better, but you thought wrong.Songs like ""Dead Moon"" have good choruses, catchy guitar and singing. Also, ""Apes on Parade"" have great and strange lyrics, great drums, and truly in the name of psychobilly. Anyone who likes psychobilly, must by this album."
1,Dead Moon disappoints,"NO STARS.I am very disappointed by this album. It is over produced and the adding of ""Guest artists/vocalists"" does not make this a good album.Mad Sin is a highly revered, heavier psychobilly band, but now the ""Billy"" influence is not even slightly evident in this poor product.Mad Sin has been around a long, long time, and a bit of progression in their sound is inevitable...BUT I found this album too commercial. But...I guess that commercial edge is what appeals to the target audience of youngsters who totally misunderstand the roots & origins of psychobilly.(Simply having an upright bass in a band does NOT make a band ""psychobilly"")I am sorry I spent money on this album."
3,beetle bailey,this dvd brought back memories of the cartoons i watched as a kid. i cannot wait to share this with my Godson
5,Best Karaoke Disc this year!,"I have bought a lot of Pop Hits Monthly before, but this disc is the best one as far as titles go! Every song on here is huge and very current. Pop Hits Monthly is by far the highest quality sounding karaoke in my opinion. I use to like Sound Choice, but they have really gone down hill! Also, as far as Country goes, Pop Hits Monthly is better than Chartbusters which use to be my brand for that. I still get Chartbuster, but only if it's not available on PHM Country."
4,More than you ever thought about air travel,"This book, by noted airline industry author Stephen Barlay, is a fine introduction to the *entire* world of commercial air travel. In addition to explaining the concept and mechanics of flight, Barlay reviews the reasons why safety is not as high a concern for many airlines as convenience and economy, the phenomenon of what I call ""Airportland,"" do's and don'ts when flying, air traffic control, and finally--the reason I bought this book--what causes airplane crashes and how they can be prevented or their effects mitigated. The book includes a section of black-and-white photos of some little-known, but important, crashes. Especially useful and surprisingly difficult is the quiz about airline safety. A lot of what you think you know is wrong! Despite including tons of information, the style is quite readable. I highly recommend this book."
3,Not accurate but Cute.,"In all the incarnations the sailor Senshi Never use anything even remotely resembling the moon cycle so, if you're a sailor moon purist this is not the toy for you. However, it is a fun accessory for the 6"" sailor moon dolls. I use mine for display along with the dolls it breaks of the monotony of all those dolls just standing there. :) Though if this is for a child it's moves rather well and makes a great play accessory. The only issue is that the gold shooting star ornaments are removable and as such with come off with rough handling.Overall this is a cute little toy and a lovely addition to any sailor moon collection."
4,a classic that stands the test of time,"The second you hear the first chords of ""Hello Hooray"" you know you're in for something great. I don't know if I'd call it folk, more like modern American Standards (Dylan and Leonard Cohen, indeed). Judy Collins uses her seemingly flawless vocals to conjure up a patchwork of rich emotions -- taking you through optimism, sadness, regret, longing and innocent hope. That's typical for Judy Collins though. What seems unique about this album is that she sings in a lower register and with more definite phrasing, so she sounds more like a story teller than on other albums (a lot like in the 9/11 tribute song she wrote). The stories become rich under her command, so we are grabbed by the urgency of ""Story of Isaac"", the hope in ""Someday Soon"" and the mixed pensive sentiment in the beautiful ""My Father"". If you've ever liked Judy Collins but perhaps aren't familiar with the songs on this album, give it a try -- she sounds great."
3,"Good, but not great","I decided to try out Judy Collins. I must admit I have a hard time with her vocal delivery. On every song, it's just too enunciated and operatic, or...*something*. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it bothers me. If you like ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes,"" (Judy does a pretty good job on this one), then PLEASE check out the superior original on Fairport Convention's album ""Unhalfbricking."" And pick up ""What We Did On Our Holiday"" while you're at it."
1,"Misinformed and badly skewed ""bible"" stories.","I grew up reading this series. They have wonderful (and scary) artwork and very strange interpretations of the bible. If you are looking for a bible story book for your kids, this is not the one. This was created by the Worldwide Church of God which believed it was God's ONE true church. The Worldwide church of God was miraculously led to review its doctrines and teachings and renounced what it taught in these books. The series is a complete misrepresentation of the bible. Steer far, far away from it."
4,bulky,"the elbow was a little bulky, oversized. Other than that it's just the thing. Difficult to find this item at other stores. I think Radio Shack didn't even have it."
3,The title says it all,"Mark, stick to non fiction writing which you do so well. This book wasn't very interesting although your writing skills nearly pulled it off. Some interesting bits here and there but overall not up to your usual standard."
3,Does not play well with MS-Word,"I really bought this CD to complement MS-Word that does not have a dictionary. I installed the program to a Win98 machine that has Word 97. It managed to place a button to the Word toolbar. The very first time that button is pressed, it displays an error message but launches the application and works fine. Then, I uninstalled it, and, installed it to my Win XP machine with office XP. This time it was a complete failure: no buttons or access to the application from MS-Word. As a conclusion, this is a fine dictionary but it does not play well with MS-Word !"
4,Early Medieval Architecture,"The text arrived in good shape, and was just as described. What kept this from being a 5-star review was the sluggishness of the delivery, some 3 1/2 weeks after being ordered."
5,Excellent introspection of folk/soul ..,"I found the album an excellent musical experience and journey. It was a journey into Kevin's introspection of life's realities's. There was a haunting and powerful theme of penetrating soul that allows the listener to believe that one was actually experiencing what he was singing...There were elements of Dylan and Clark. ""Behind the Veil"" is a very original piece...something that can be played repeatedly with enjoyment...and that may have been written many years ago and brought forth many years later...like a fine bottle of wine...the songs are ageless in time and this album will prove to be a classic presently and many years from now. I look forward to new material from this artist. J. Garcia"
2,Too many errors for a Study Guide,"I found the book easy to read, and most of the information was correct, but there are some glaring errors. It is not helpful to find these in a study guide. I admit I am learning a lot as I have to double-check so much of the information with other sources. Don't take the information as Gospel and make sure you check the authors work! It would help if there was an Errata page, but I can't find one anywhere, nor can I find a link to a web page or Email for the author."
2,It's not a good book for study networking,"I found some mistakes (mistypes char/word, wrong theory, etc) in this book. You should have another book for references."
5,FOUND MY FAVORITE MASCARA,"I love this mascara .... and, had been searching for it, since they quit selling it ... in the USA ....SO, glad to have it, again"
3,"Disappointing ""biography"" far too focussed on kidnapping, ignores rest of life","I wouldn't expect a book released at the time of ""Loss of Eden"" to contain hints of Lindbergh's late-in-life foray into bigamy (quadrigamy?), but I would have expected more of the Lindberghs' lives in this. This is nothing but yet another drawn-out, boring, dull, irrelevant exploration of their eldest son's murder, surrounded by a few chapters - and only a few - of their lives before and after the murder.Can we get some perspective here, people? The murder of their child was a horrible thing, yes, but it was absolutely not the central fact of their lives and did not deserve more than a single chapter here, let alone half the book!I was so disappointed."
5,"""Loss of Eden: A Biography of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh"" by Joyce Milton","I came across a mention of this when I was refreshing my memory on some points of the Lindbergh Kidnapping case after watching Nova's episode on it.I have read several books on the kidnapping, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's diaries, Reeve Lindbergh's book, and several books on Charles Lindbergh as well. I am enjoying ""Loss of Eden"" immensely. It is well-written, well-reasoned, and I am learning things about the Morrow and Lindbergh families I never even remotely imagined, and all without being gossipy or trashy.I would recommend reading this over watching Nova's episode, which I didn't think was sound or up to their standards. Joyce Milton's book is much more thorough and better researched, in my opinion."
1,Don't buy it. This is garbage,This is the worst garbage software I have ever used period and I am an engr and computer expert. If you are using w9x you will have to call them to get it installed. This starts your free 30 day free phone support. This is just the start of your problems. Wait until you try to add files to record and the whole program folds on you and locks your machined up. Not only on this computer but several other computers of mine it acts exactly the same way... This is truely garbage software. If you buy it.. have fun...lol.... Don't say you weren't warned!
4,1931 Edition of Vitalogy,"This is where we got our ""Grandma's healing oil"". It is a concoction made of linseed oil and turpentine, and something else - ahhhh the secret ingredient. Anyway, we have been putting this on ourselves since I was a boy and a few dogs and barnyard animals as well! Great antiseptic for minor cuts and scratches as it stops the pain and promotes rapid healing. When I described it to a pharmicist, he thought I was crazy. He should be more open minded.Also in this book there is listed a cure for hair loss. It suggests washing your hair with 'coal oil'. Sounds crazy - doesn't it. Well, while noticing a funny odor from my Denorex anti-dandruff shampoo I decided to read the label. Interesting enough, it contains coal oil. Must at least cure itchy-flaky scalp! We'll see on the hair loss bit."
1,"Poorly made Movie about Bataan, not totally true","This Movie is mostly blood and death. At the end of the movie all soldiers die. That is not the truth at all. There is much, much more to this story than this movie portrays. If you want to know the truth about the Bataan Death March, do not buy this movie. What you want to do is record from the History Channel or buy from Amazon.com if they have them, are documented story's of the POW's that were there, and lived the experience. However if Blood and Guts is what you are looking for, you will love this movie."
5,Bataan/Back To Bataan,"I was born in Cavite City, Philippines. On a clear day I could see the island of Corregidor which is a part of Cavite Province and on the northwestern part of Manila Bay, Bataan. I have seen Bataan at AMC (American Movie Classics) several times but I want a DVD for my own collection. Back to Bataan was really an added excellent bonus to my collection. Both movies has shown how our American friends together with Filipino fighters, resisted the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. So much courage and sacrifice were shown by these two movies which is why our two countries are very much in close ties with each other. I must say that it will take awhile before this two masterpieces will be duplicated. Five star for both movies.R.M.Poblete, Carson, Ca"
3,Bataan; Back to Bataan,"From the standpoint of movie quality, Bataan was very good. However, Back to Bataan is a trumped up way to feature John Wayne in yet another war film."
3,america fights back,"I saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It was one of the first films made shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was designed to anger the American public, and did it ever! In addition to Robert Taylor and George Murphy, also in the cast was Thomas Mitchell and a Cuban guy named Desi Arnez. To me it is a real WWII classic with damned good acting."
4,hint hint,"anyone thinking to buy this may want to check the Vtech website firstthere is also a carrying bag you can get....That said I love getting this for my 8 year old nephew with ADHD; he can focus better on these and learn. His grades are so good now that I get him VTech products. Not a substitue for sitting with your kid and making sure he has his homework done, but as a great supplement when you want him to play and yet learn. He really likes it. I am starting with Touch Tablet and then going to ""upgrade"" to this once he understands how to use it. Luckily the price I have paid for both were similar, and I have not paid over @125 to have both (hint hint).....total! Anything to not have a kid on mindless video games or TV all day and to help their lil brains."
1,Please Please Please Do not buy this item,"1) The packaging color was slightly faded. (1st red flag)2) The blade did not snap on my handle securely (2nd red flag)3) Blades did not shave but rather pulled my facial hair out (3rd red flag)The **REAL** mach 3 blades are fabulous, these are clearly of a lesser build quality.... Stay away. Currently seeking a refund. Please read the other reviews.Bought from Infinite-Surplus...boooooo!!!"
1,Poor Quality,"These blades are not the same as I buy in the store. Either rejects, from some new plant or cheap substitutes. Never again."
1,Beware of quantity,"Blades are okay, however the quantity sold is wrong. This product is advertised for 2 packs of 16 blades (32 blades total). When I received the order I received 4 packs of 4 blades each (16 blades total). I contacted the seller and they insisted that this is for 16 blades total (as they said 2 packs of 8 blades) and that they never had this type of problems before. Very disappointing, I shopped with amazon.com and when it says 2 pack is double the amount listed."
2,BadTurbos,Gillette has let quality decline. Several blades locked in the full 90 degree swivel position when they should have returned to the regular straight position. Had to forcibly straighten several times during the shave in order to continue.
5,the expected product,Like I saw on line Icould get tis product without any incovinient and in the expectes and promissed time.Now I can have them in an axcellent price and without problems
1,poor quality,gillette used to make fine blades. no longer. feel like was in a cat fight after using their blades now. anyone know of a better blade?
1,These are NOT real Mach 3's,"These are FAKES and are barely usable. Yes, you will probably get them quickly and yes, it is a good price for Mach 3's but the fact is these are NOT Mach 3's. Don't waste your money on these virtually unusable blades. Go to the store and buy the real ones."
1,Fake!,"I bought it from Amazon, not from the private seller. But these are fake. Amazon should be ashamed of selling fake/imitation products."
1,something wrong with these blades,"This is not product, which I always use. It feels like these are old blades put into new pack. even after using a healthy dose of shaving gel these blades were not gliding and shaving like they are supposed to be. I am never ever going to buy these again."
1,Beware - these are not legitimate Gillette razors,"I have been using Mach 3 razors for over ten years, and I can say for certain that the razors I purchased here were of a lower quality than what i last purchased at Walgreens. I typically get 4-5 shaves out of each razor before noticing any rough feeling, but these things felt defective beginning on the first stroke. Unusable."
1,Awful results,"These blades did not live up to the level of quality I have learned to expect from Gillette.Normally, I am able to use 1 Mach3 Turbo blade 3 x - if I clean the blades with rubbing alcohol between each use. This sort of cost saving manuever proves to be effective, if, and only if I shave every day - (can't skip a day).These blades did not seem sharp and would shave clean only one time. Second attempt is a painful hair pulling experience.Something's wrong with the glide strips. They provide more friction than prevent.Gillette products are found in nearly every country imaginable - why on earth are the blades I purchase in Eastern Europe far superior to those sold in the United States???"
1,Fake product,I bought this blades long time ago and used them only once. They are fake and my 10 times used blades are shaving way better.waste of money
2,Bad angle/leverage for under nose,"I don't like this razor. I've been using sensor excel for years and really like them. So I gave these a chance when they were on sale. However, I can't fit this new razor under my nose comfortably. The handle comes almost strait down from the blades, instead of more perpendicular to the cutting surface. I have eight blades of these to use and maybe I'll get used to them."
1,Terrible,"These razors used to be high quality but they are now officially awful. After shaving once, they are too dull to even use a second time. I bought these direct from Amazon so I'm pretty sure they are not counterfeit. Does anyone have a suggestion on a blade which works well and lasts, the way Mach3s used to (before these apparent quality issues)?"
5,Bargain price for an excellent quality product.,Am very pleased and happy I bought this product from Amazon as I got the excellent Gillette quality products at your low price.
2,Not orignal Gillette or second rated,I am using Gillette for almost 20 years and know them well. I got it online for second time and both times I am disappointed. I will not recommend anyone to buy razors online. These are all duplicate Gillette or second rated products. Good for only 1-2 shaves and then you get bad feeling after shaves. The original Gillette product last longer and are probably good for 12+ shaves (never counted).Always buy this product from good store. Saving money is good but at your skin's cost.There are some expensive Gillette products on Amazon... not sure if they are same or different.
2,Awful Experience,Its real bad one. The very first shave is like a month old blade. It seems like I got the duplicate stuff. Lately I am finding that many products on amazon are duplicate
1,Bad impression,This product is not original item. While shaving you will feel the difference. I did not like this product at all.
2,defecive razors,I recently purchased 8 mach3 turbo catridges out of which 2 were defective. The catridges would fall off the handle as their 'indents inside the catridge to hold the handle' were either broken or not of proper size. The other 6 catridges were fine. I have purchased Gillette products before from on line places and never had defective ones till now.
1,FAKE! DO NOT PURCHASE,"These are fake Mach3 Turbo blades. The packaging looks authentic, but you'd be better off pulling out your whiskers with pliers than shaving with these blades. If you must do business with Mr. Bargain, offer him $14 for a punch in the face: You'll get the same rip-off and the same pain, but you won't have to hassle with the return policy."
4,Gillette for the win.,I have not used any other shaving system that came close to Gillette's smoothness. I am very sensitive and have few proublems with the 3 blade setup. Only issue I have is that they are pricy.
5,"Great blades, great price.","These have gotten so expensive, even at Costco, where they aren't always available. When they are, you have to buy almost $50 worth. This 10-pack is much easier on the wallet. With my new trick, these blades will last me about 20-30 months. (My ""trick"" is to keep the blade immersed in rubbing alcohol after using to keep the blades' edges from oxidizing and becoming dull in 1-2 weeks. Blades last 2-3 MONTHS this way.)"
2,not good blades,"i'm using gillette for many years,i never bought from online before and wanted to try this,it's kind a dull blade it's hurt when shaving and not shaving well,and i didn't like it didn't worked for me"
1,Want to save some money?,"I love my Mach 3 Turbo, and the 1 star isnt because its a crappy product. I get a pretty awesome shave from it. It is because of clever marketing to fleece money out of loyal consumers. Heres a nifty secret, the most discernible difference between the Turbo refill blades and the regular Mach 3 blades......packaging and a different colored stripe.Yup, its practically the same thing. Just far more expensive. Ive been refilling my turbo with regular Mach 3 blades for about 3 years now and I promise there isnt enough of a difference to pay more. It fits the same, shaves the same and almost looks the same. Just buy the cheaper Gillette Mach3 blades and presto changeo, you have saved some cash and gotten an nearly identical blade refill. I just bought a 5 pack of regulars for $13 instead of the turbo blades for $17. You're welcome."
1,FAKE!!,"I should have read the reviews more carefully. When I received the blades, they looked like the same ones I buy in the stores, but they were not. I just started to use them and they are dull and dangerous. I have now gone through three blades in a couple of weeks. I keep trying new ones, but after one or two uses, they are very dull. These are not real Gillette blades. A real Gillette blade usually lasts for around 3 or 4 weeks. It is probably too late to send them back, so I felt I needed to write this to warn others!"
5,Great Service,Item arrived quickly than expected and its a great value for the money I spent.Your service is excellent.Thanks.
1,"A good razor, but don't buy it from Amazon","The Gillette Mach3 Turbo is a perfectly good razor, but when I bought theses blades from Amazon they turned out to be fake- ineffective, painful, unusable. They gave me a refund, but I'm not going to buy razor blades online again."
1,Feels Like It's Ripping Hairs Out,"I don't know if these are seconds or what, but it feels like you're shaving with sandpaper or epilady or something. They're horrible."
1,Gillette Mach 3 blades,I bought replacement Mach 3 blades recently through Amazon. This blades are bad and feels dull. They only lasted 1 or 2 shaves. I have bought this same brand blades before from other sources that have lasted me a few weeks of shaving.Could it be a possible bad batch of blades?
1,These blades are NOT the ones you buy in the store,"As suggested in an earlier review I was careful not to buy these blades from anyone other than directly from Amazon. But I still received the inferior blades that are not manufactured to U.S. standards. These blades are not as sharp from the start and only last 2 or 3 shaves compared to 10 or more for the ones I buy from Walmart, Target, or Sam's. The lube strip also wears out with the first shave. I have been told that these blades are made in Europe where the steel quality is poor and the manufacturing process is not as exacting. Do not buy these blades on Amazon, period. It looks like a good deal but you are better off paying more at a retail store for the real thing."
4,Decent value & good performance,Long time Mach3 user and these are my favorite. Each cartridge lasts for about 9 days with daily shaving. They cut great for 4-5 days then get progressively worse.
3,Turbo fades fast,These razors don't stay sharp too long. Only good for 3 to 4 shaves before they need replacing.
1,mach 3 turbo,"The shipment of the 16 blades was defective. All the blades were old, made in Germany and were very dull. I was unable to use them and had to return them for credit. Amazon credited my account for the blades but failed to credit me for the freight."
1,Ripoff!,"I bought these from Amazon when it was feature on ""Today's Deals"" some months ago and was terribly disappointed. I usually by the cheaper blades, but since these were on sale I figured why not. I couldn't believe how terrible they were. If I'd known they were fakes I would have returned them to Amazon, but I just figured they just didn't work for me for some reason. I could barely get three shaves off them before getting cuts and abrasions. Even the very first shave with a new cartidge felt worse than a well-used cheap blade. I'm really disappointed with Amazon. From now on I'll only order books through them."
1,Bad!,"The Gillette Mach 3 blades from my local store have been wonderful. But I think the blades purchased online are defective, and may not be orginal. They don't last long, and the blades go bad after a couple of shaves."
1,Fake Fake Fake Blades,"Mine were purchased directly from Amazon and all the blades are fake. The lubricant is not smooth and only lasts 2-3 shaves before completely fading, the blades cut my face from the first try of each blade, and I never get a close shave from these fakes. Amazon's quality control has gone down hills which reflects poorly for the company and management who simply don't give a darn! Stay away from buying these here!!"
1,"The Naysayers, alas, are right","Gillette's Mach 3 Turbo is probably the best razor ever made. My research, though, indicates that Gillette has let its quality control on this item go down to the basement. The blade head follows the curvature of your face but in a lackadaisical manner. So if you're shaving your chin, say, the razor may think its still shaving your cheek and ouch! goes a piece of your skin.Amazon buys its blades directly from Gillette so Amazon seemingly is not at fault. But the large number of complaints over the past several years, and my direct inquiry to Amazon about the matter has brought no effective action.My advice: any man who wants to keep a pretty, nick-free face should look for blades aother than the Mach3 Turbo."
1,Junk!,"The Boccherini 'Stabat Mater' is sung hideously (I reviewed it some years ago), the Pergolesi 'Stabat Mater' is not only sung hideously but seems to have been utterly botched by the recording technicians and editors. I haven't had the temerity to listen to the Rossini. There are NO redeeming qualities to this 'box set', since I doubt that it would start much of a camp fire."
5,A Time of Change,"I remember how shocked I was when this album was released, it seemed so different from her earlier work. She looked almost confrontational to me on the cover! However, it was a definite step forward for her, and as always, I followed. Unlike others, my favorite song on her is ""I Think It's Going To Rain Today"". This song so struck me at the time that I can still remember where I was when I first heard it.Probably like other reviewers, I am very grateful that these recordings have made it into a kind of permanence on CD. I can trace the majority of my years through my purchases of Judy Collins, and this music means a lot to me."
5,Judy at Her Best.,"It only took me 30 some years to discover the talents of Judy Collins, but I'll never under-appreciate her again. This album is simply stunning. From ""Tom Thumb's Blues"", the opening Dylan track, through Brecht and Weill's ""Pirate Jenny"", the French Revolution epic ""Marat/Sade"", Randy Newman's beautiful ""I Think It's Going to Rain Today"" and the Lennon/McCartney title track, there's not a moment on this album that isn't absolutely beautiful. Well produced, with beautiful orchestrations behind Judy's peerless vocals. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Don't wait 30 some years like I did!!"
5,Classic,"The image folk brings is one person and a guitar, and this was true in the early 1960s. But once Dylan went electric, musical possibilities opened for folk.In My Life exploits these perfectly. A lot here is Judy Collins covering tracks like ""Pirate Jenny,"" which Nina Simone had recorded earlier in the decade, and ""Suzanne"" by Leonard Cohen, and the Beatles title track. This music is full of harpsichords, baroque orchestrations, lush arrangements that run through the album.Collins' voice as always is bell-clear, complimenting perfectly the dense instrumentation. Tim Buckley, Fairport Convention, lots of amazing music that is called folk was released as such during the era. In My Life is one of the best. Get it"
5,An old friend,"I bought my first vinyl copy of this album in Vietnam. Since then, I have worn out two vinyl copies and a tape, and I bought this CD as a gift for a friend while I have another CD at home. This album is a hugely significant part of my home."
4,Their 2nd best,"Out of all their records, I listen to this one and Strange Days the most. Strange Days is their best psychedelic album, where this one is their best jazz/rock album."
2,Two words: Contractual obligation.,"I am a huge Doors fan, but have to acknowledge sub-par performance when it happens. Credit the band for completing the album, considering the internal problems they were encountering. Still, they are a fantastic band. Never has there been a more perfect fit with only four players to fit the parts. The Grateful Dead could do wonders, but they had a lot of people involved. The Doors were that quick spark that makes you both uncomfortable, and excited about the darkness that pervades our everyday existence."
5,True poetry,"This was truely one of Jim Morrisons masterpieces. Although Krieger wrote the magority of the songs, this is still one 4 Jim. The pure poetic power can be felt by one and all and the reason all people hate it is cause they fear it. They fear to have there god publicly insulted and asked not to be petitioned. They fear wanting to touch one another. they fear the darkened chase of grizzly bears hot on there heals.but most of all they fear change. Too bad if you do because the soft parade has not only begun, it's a long running part of life. Don't listen to the music if u don't like it but please let the music fill ur room and allow the lyrics to take you away."
1,Don't Bother Buying This!,"Jim Morrison must be rolling over in his grave. They have redone the whole album and it sucks. It does not have the gritty bite of the original. All of the Doors remixed, remastered and re-engineered albums have been corrupted and someone or someones had their heads up their collective ass and destroyed some great songs. If it ain't broke don't fix it!"
3,Welcome to the 70's,"3 1/2Regarded by some as their worst, TSP is indeed plagued with over-orchestrations and Morrison at his most indulgent, leading to its share of embarrassing moments. But it still absolutely cannot be dismissed. Some of the gruffer, shallowly composed songs may fall flat, but when the group attunes the big-band influences properly they still manage to land a handful of tracks that had that elusive immortal factor so much of their best work inhabited."
2,Bogus Doors,"This is a bogus Doors CD with Jim Morrison. They didn't really sell out but were trying to shed their rebellious hippie image in favor of teeny bopper bubble gum to the point where they were on the cover of Tiger Beat. The music isn't bad, in fact it's really good, it's just the fact of one of their weakest singles, Touch Me, and compares poorly to the more inspired debut and LA Woman, poorly to even Morrison Hotel. This is called Soft Parade because The Doors are soft core now. If you just listen to it straight through it's great background music for sitting back and relaxing, but the Doors here are pure bubble gum, which got criticized for catering to pubescent audiences. I got this as relic of the 60s and 1900s for 2 bucks. I don't have the 2007 remaster, this is the 1990 CD reissue. I want rebellous or older drunk Doors. I'm not saying it sucks, it's just this bubble gum version of a classic rock band doesn't do it for me not get me pumped."
2,Phat Parade and Soft Blues,"This is a masterpiece...that never was. I am sorry but the opener: Tell all the People, has got to be the most pretencious song on this album. It really goes beyond cheesy. Touch me, well now there is a song to match anything Sweat, Blood and Tears ever did. Actually, the entire Soft Parade struggles to be the Doors and at the same time Sweat, Blood and Tears. Why? It is obvious why Jim Morrison did not want his songs orchastrated..they would loose their raw sensuality. The songs that lack punch here are Robbie Kriegers. They inspire only a subtle muse. Shaman Blues and Wild Child, both by Morrison, clearly display the only direction in this shallow album. But it is not enough to carry the weight. The Soft Parade is weak..tell all the people."
1,Strange Days for this fourth album CD by The Doors!,"Only song that I have it's the tune called ""Touch Me"" which is good that's on my Best of collection. This one does'nt interest and suit my taste here!"
1,The Soft Parade,"The title cut on this CD would not play. Returned the CD for a replacement but that was the same, the title cut wouldn't play. Returned that one too and gave up on getting the CD."
3,Yes but...............,I think these are going to actually be the definitive versions. On the doors website it states the 99 mixes will not be replaced once they sell out. Thats kinda of a shame because the music is slightly different. I don't like it as much. The vocals are pushed back. It still sounds great though. The package is nice with the bonus tracks and lyrics.
4,"Weakest album, still very memorable","This is, admittedly, The Doors' weakest effort. Despite all the talk about Morrison being overrated and hyped as the driving force behind the band (he was--check out the post-Morrison Doors albums to see how well they did without him), the reason is that by this time Morrison had pretty much given up on The Doors and music in general as vehicles with which to change the world. Morrison was looking for far, far more than commercial success, and he probably never found it. Nonetheless, there are captivating moments which remind us of The Doors explosive potential (""The Soft Parade""/""Wishful/Sinful"") and demonstrate the bands superiority to their flower power contemporaries. The truth is that any Doors effort involving Morrison, even minimally, deserves attention."
3,Doors brass and jazz. And....COUNTRY?,"A polished, even sheen sounding album, Soft Parade is the Doors at their jazziest. Including a full horn section on certain tracks, the Doors swing like the old cats used to. This does not detract from their unmistakeable sound, but does add an element or two. Robby Krieger's ""Runnin' Blue"" is (in my opinion)the best country tune ever. And I know. I live in Houston. Anyway, the Doors do truly jam on this album, never mind any other lascivious review you have read before."
3,Buy all The Doors albums! Just save this one for last.,"Everyone who is a rock music fan should own all of The Doors albums. However, this is the one to save for last because it is just not as good as their others!"
5,Different!!!! But always deep.,"I know that many people dislike this album. I'm not to much of a fan with some of the music and chords that were put together on this album, but it's not as bad as many think. I just want everybody to keep something in mind when they think of this album as ""sub-par.""Each one of The Doors where individuals with thoughts of success and fame of their own. I see this album as being a way for all the artist in the group to go in their own way to succeed their goals. Although this album didn't come out as strong as the other albums. On the last song of this album they all seem to have their visions down of what they want. Then they all come back again through the music and finish with a kick ass song on the album. The Doors knew what they were doing when releasing this album. They weren't being ""sloppy, or lazy."""
5,My favorite Doors song is on this album,This album is wonderful. I love every song on it. The Soft Parade is also my favorite song by The Doors. Any Doors fan must own this album.
4,"Not bad, but not great...","The Soft Parade is hardly a bad album. It just sounds unlike anything else The Doors have ever done. The Doors couldn't make a bad album if they tried. The Soft Parade doesn't quite compare to the great stuff that follwed on Morrison Hotel and L.A. Woman, but this is still a good album. It has its high points (Touch Me, Tell All The People, Wild Child) and it's low points (Runnin' Blue). For any true Doors fan, it's a must-have."
4,A Decent Album,"This is not the Doors' best, nor the worst by far. If one is to rate this through the cassette version, the B-side would rank, in my opinion, as the best. ""Wild Child"", ""Running Blues"", ""Wishful Sinful"" and ""The Soft Parade"" are the best entries. Side A's ""Touch Me"" is the best of that portion, while the other songs are just, well, there. Those entries are not bad, but just lack noteworthiness."
2,Although I consider myself one of the biggest fans...,"This has GOT to be the crappiest CD they ever gave out. Jim what right to order that each song to be labeled so that everyone would know who wrote which songs. Most of Robbie's songs were weak, except for Touch Me. Many of Jim's weren't all to great either. The only songs that are really worth listening to are Shaman's Blues, Touch Me and Wild Child. And perhaps Runnin' Blues, just for the laughs you get when Robbie breaks into song with Jim. They must have been stoned to let HIM sing. He's a great guitarits, but he should keep his mouth shut. I can NOT believe that I have said such things about my absolute favorite band. I think it's been a long time since such a group of amazingly talented and unique individuals got together to create something that can only be called art, but this was not one of their best. Far from it."
1,...,"I disliked this album when it came out, and I still dislike it. Lets see how it came to pass (IMO). The first two Door's albums are the greatest rock albums ever recorded. Nothing before or since has ever come close. Unfortunately, ""Strange Days"" did not do as well as everyone would have liked. So, out came ""Waiting for the Sun"", and ...it's a hit. Would the next album go in the direction of great songs such as ""Five to One"", and ""Not to Touch the Earth""? No. It went in the direction of the worst song on WFTS, ""Winterime love"". Well, why not. If yours fans prefer ""Hello, I love you"" to ""People are Strange"", then you better give them what they want, good and hard. ... Well here it is, the Soft (and oh so sticky) Parade. Thank God it bombed. If it too had been a hit the wonderful, rollicking Morrison Hotel would have sounded just like so many variations of ""Tell all the People"". Tell all the people that you see follow me, follow me down. ..."
2,Hold your nose,"Es stinky! I suspect some marketing ""genius"" decided the Doors needed to sound like Chicago, the Outsiders or some of the other brass pop bands. I bought it only because I can't find ""Runnin' Blues"" anywhere else and I'm compiling a CD version of ""Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,"" a 1972 compilation on LP."
2,Anybody want to buy my copy?,"The Doors are off the scale at their best but this isn't it. The lyrics are awkward and the music sounds forced. Eccentric without a good reason. Waiting For The Sun is my idea of a good Door's album. Strange Days, Morrison Hotel, The Doors, all of them much stronger albums. I plan on trading this one at Disc-Go-Round."
3,"A ""Good"" album, but not a good Doors album","Unlike all the other Doors albums I've listened to, I struggled through 'The Soft Parade'. With previous albums, I listened to them straight through in one sitting over and over again for weeks. When I put the 'Soft Parade' album on I found myself sampling a few minutes of each song, then skipping quickly to the next until a song I felt was decent came on to listen all the way through (And there wasn't too many of these on this album). Of course weeks later after 'Warming Up' to the album I was able to listen to it all in one sitting. I certainly enjoyed the album, but It was not a good album for 'The Doors'. As an entire entity 'The Soft Parade' in no way shape or form sounds like any of the bands recorded material previous to it and after it. Sure, there are a few tracks that are certainly identifiable with the bands sound, but too few and far between unfortunately. If the Doors were experimenting with this album, they really goofed!"
4,the review,"I think that this is probably the best Doors album besides L.A. Woman. The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because Morrison wasn't at his best on this album but the rest of the band was. ""Touch Me"" written by guitarist Robby Krieger is the best Doors song ever in my mind. Runnin' Blues, Tell all the People, Wild Child, and Soft Parade are great songs as well. If you buy this CD you'll be happy."
5,Nice Touch,"This album is good. The Doors when they were making this album was trying the brassy 60's style that was popular at the time. I'm okay with this album it has classics like Wild Child, The Soft Parade, Shaman's Blues and of course the hit off the album Touch Me. Also the soft ballad of Wisful Sinful is a great deep moving song from The Doors that you really never here off their other albums. Buy all The Doors albums. One of the best bands of all time!"
3,The Doors in Transition,"""The Soft Parade"" (1969) remains The Doors' weakest studio recording, yet the overall album is not without merit. ""Shaman's Blues"" and ""Wild Child"" pave the way for the blues-oriented sound of the far-superior ""Morrison Hotel"" (1970) and ""L.A. Woman"" (1971). These aforementioned tracks, along with the hit single ""Touch Me"" and the underrated ""Wishful Sinful,"" are the highlights of a rather schizophrenic album. ""Tell All the People"" and ""Runnin' Blue"" sound like ersatz Blood, Sweat and Tears, while the ambitious title song suffers from a decided lack of focus (the 1969 live version on PBS has a lot more vocal and instrumental punch). Despite its flaws, ""The Soft Parade"" would prove a step in the right direction for Jim Morrison and company, resulting in some of their finest work."
5,The Doors Mature..,"This is the LP I often call the Doors' most underrated. When it first appeared in 1969, many hardcore fans lamented the fact that the band augmented it's usual lineup with horns, strings and a host of other instrumental touches that seemed to soften their hard charging, blues based, spacy attack. Well, don't believe the hype, this is the band stretching out to glorious effect on suberb tracks like ""Shaman's Blues"",""Easy Ride"" and the incredible 3 part title track (featuring a frightening spoken word intro by Morrison)that all adds up to one of the more varied and consistently listenable records this L.A. band ever released."
4,It's a good CD,"If you are thinking about getting this CD than DO IT. It's overall a great record. The songs that i found the best were: Touch Me, Shermans Blues, Wild Child, and Soft Parade. This album is one of The Doors weakest albums, However, It does have a lot of good songs on it. It does not go up to the power of the La Woman and Morrison Hotel albums.If you are looking to buy a good Doors album than this is the one for you!"
1,2007 WARNER VERSION VERSUS 2000 EAST-WEST VERSION!,"If you have papersleeves part of 2000 version, don't buy the 2007 Warner Version! Ok, 2007 with Bonus Tracks, is a great attractive for fans, but the sound is remixed, with new tones of vocals and others instruments, making a sound different of original versions!The 2000 version issued by East -West/Elektra in Japan in 2000, is the same sound than 1999 American Elektra reissues, the sound is the same, excellent without any part remixed. Save your money, buy 1999 American Version, or 2000 Papersleve at used stores as Ebay.All in all, this 2007 papersleeve contains different OBIS, beautiful, but the remix sound make this a garbage!"
3,Rain On The Parade,"By far the weakest of the releases with Jim Morrison, the addition (overproduction) of horns and strings cannot bolster the uneven set, released in 1969, with guitarist Robbie Krieger contributing an unusually large number of tracks.The highlights are Touch Me and Tell All The People - outstanding pop selections - which sustain the surreal quality of the band's music/lyrics. Wild Child is Morrison poking fun at his pop-culture persona - a wity parody of himself - but the plodding title track typifies a band that has hit a creative rut.The six bonus tracks make it more intriguing, but even the most legendary bands have a couple rough spots in its discography. Rain briefly fell on this parade, but The Doors were poised to deliver some creative fire in 1970 and 1971."
2,Not Good,"Although i am a diehard Doors fan and i own every album, i dislike this one. The song Soft Parade is overrated. Really the only worhwhile songs are Wild Child, Tell all the people and Touch Me, as opposed to almost all songs on other Doors albums being classics. if ur a new Doors fan go with Self Titled or Morrison Hotel. Then get Strange Days or LA woman or a live album. Keep the Soft Parade, WFTS, and American Prayer for last."
1,The worst Doors album,Buy this album and you will agree. Miami was surely on all their minds when they did this one.
1,Could This Be It?,"Is it true? Have I found the worst album of all time? I think so. It's a thirty-three minute record with three minutes of enjoyment: the first three minutes of Shaman's Blues (which even then overstays its welcome). The rest? Oh, god. The rest. Well, there's the over-the-top hippy anthem Tell All the People. There are a pair of annoying good-timey blues tunes (Do It; Easy Ride) and one painfully bad one (Wild Child). There's Wishful Sinful, which is painful. Runnin' Blue, a country/soul Otis Redding tribute, is a disgrace to the man's memory thanks in part to Krieger's vocals in the chorus. The overblown, eight-minute title track is an example of how over-the-top Jim could be if he tried. Touch Me, the one everybody knows, is the second-best song on this album, but would've been the second-worst on the debut or Morrison Hotel.Teah, I'd say this is the worst ever, though some of AC/DC's '80's work gives it a run for its money."
5,The musicians by Sempe,Watching at Sempe's drawings somethings make us feel we were reading through its trails. Impressive sensibility to describe feelings and funy situationsun peu de Paris et d'ailleurs
1,Bad Idea!!!,"This kit is NOT what you are looking. I will not assume that you have read articles and discussions on the web about ""trumpet care"" and trumpet care kits. I read them and decided that I still wanted some good tools for cleaning my trumpet and bought this kit. So what's wrong with this kit?1. The tubular looking thing in the picture with two brushes attached to the ends is a STIFF plastic with serious memory so it does not go around the bends in your horn without enough force to damage your horn.2. The brushes consist of an even stiffer wire twisted around the bristles of the brush material (plastic) and there is no protective material on the end. So if you try to push this material around one of the crooks of a slide, you will gouge the inside of your horn.You also might think that a ""silver care kit"" especially a ""Master Silver Care Kit"" would include some nice non-abrasive silver polish.There is nothing in this kit to give it a positive rating."
2,basic relaxation techniques,"This woman has never (to my knowledge) suffered a miscarriage. She is a hypnotherapist who treats miscarriage sufferers. If you have any experience at all with meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques, this book will be a total waste for you."
1,Broke at the first time used,"This item is acceptable providing you are not playing above high school level.My lab bought this item for research purpose, having college baseball players hit baseball into it. The net broke at the first time I used it. A ball tore and ripped the net, flew through it, and created a hole at the wall 25 feet behind the net. We have to postpone the research project until find a safe way to continue -- which definitely can't be achieved with this net.The net simply doesn't have the strength to stop a baseball hit by a college level player. Three or four strings were broken by the ball.For reference, the ball speed was around 90mph. You may use this net for either hitting or pitching practice. However, if you think the ball you hit can be this fast, or you are a pitcher who can throw this fast, don't buy it. You may accidentally hurt somebody when this net fails and you are in big trouble."
4,"Large, Durable, and Affordable","The backstop is large, durable and does the job. The price is very competitive. I use it as a baseball pitching backstop and a soccer goal, which is what my kids need it for. I would recommend this itme to others, as I have purchased similar items in the past."
5,Fits the need,"Perfect for practice at the house. We are using it for hitting off the tee, both soft-toss and live hitting, and both pitching alone and full distance with a catcher. Can be set up by one person, but two works best. We have also hit golf balls into it. So far so good. Folds easier than expected. The more it is used the easier it is to set up and take down.The only down side is that you have to use the tie-down ropes, but they are easily accessible in bags attached the corners.Works great for what us!"
2,Overall disappointing....,"I was very disappointed by this film. As an avid Dostoyevsky admirer, I was hoping for a cerebral, much more thought provoking film. Instead, I was dealt with a film that felt liked dumbed down Dostoyevsky. The filmmakers should have known that a film like this would have had only a limited audience, and should have done a full blown Dostoyevsky adaptation, with all the despair and grief and joy that accompanies his novels and short stories. They played it way too safe. The ending of the film is rather pretentious as well. On the plus side, Henry Czerny is very good as the title character. He is an intense, brooding actor that fits in well with Dostoyevsky's machinations. Sheryl Lee is good as the prostitute who the underground man ""saves"", then abandons. The rest of the film has awkward fantasy sequences and bland performances. Read the novella instead."
4,"Modernized, but holds onto the theme","Worthy reinterpretation of Dostoevsky's disturbing psychological portrait of where selfish-rationalism eventually leads. Perhaps a bit over-sexualized, but the point comes across nonetheless."
3,"Maybe I'm just new to Buk, but its just ok","This book had some intersting stuff and it was better in the beginning than in the end. This is the first thing i've ever read by him and i know some people who are really into his poetry, so that's why I picked up one of them from the library. Most of it .... Every once in a while a good poem comes up but most of it is choppy and reptitive and boring. I should have started with a different one."
4,Good Product,"I liked the shampoo, only it does dry the hair by stripping away the oils, so a good conditioner is very important after using it. I have noticed a decrease in the flaking in my head. It says that its okay to use everyday, but I wouldnt recommend it. Twice a week would be good, if you color your hair."
2,Very Pleased,"I am so happy with this product. It leaves my hair clean. Also, with other shampoos I felt like there was a residue left on my hair, not with this shampoo. I had a problem with my scalp feeling itchy with the shampoos I was using and that is completely gone now. Even my hairdresser asked what I was using because my hair was in such good shape. Thanks,Nature's Gate, for my Tea Tree Calming Shampoo, I love it."
2,I found something better for dandruff and sebum balls.,"I bought this stuff about 6 months ago and it worked for a little while. It has some helpful ingredients (jojoba, tea tree oil etc.) but it also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). This stuff dries out your hair follicles and scalp and and cause a reaction which actually creates more dandruff and sebum. I've started using Jaons Natural Cosmetic Dandruff Relief Shampoo. All the same ingredients minus the SLS. This has worked soooo much better than Nature's Gate. Write me if you have questions."
4,Silky Smooth,"I just received this product and it is awesome. My hair is super smooth (that may also be because I am using the tea tree conditioner from nature's gate in addition to the shampoo). I love the pleasant scent, it's not overbearing. I find that this lathers up much nicer than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo. I feel like my hair isn't clean if I don't have a lot of suds (strange, but true). I've only been using it for 3 or 4 days, but so far I really like it. I gave this review a four because I haven't noticed any difference in my scalp condition yet, this doesn't really bother me as I have yet to find a product that helps. Overall though this is an excellent shampoo."
4,Good while it lasted!,"this ring is honestly one of the cutest i've ever bought... the only problem was that it had fairly loose ends, which needed more tightening than usual compared to what i'm used to... as a result i lost both of the crystal ends, but still have the ring itself. it was truly a great belly ring while i had it!!"
1,ILF,"This product is fine, but that is not what I received. I called the company and they told me if I would pay the shipping to ship it back that they would send the right thing. My question is why should I pay shipping for something that they made a mistake on?????"
5,Down to Earth,"This book is real, full of life and inspiring. Never have I read a book that makes me laugh and cry in equal amounts as much as God and Coffee: in that order did. You can pick up this book and read the forty memoirs in no particular order; this makes the reading, relaxing and rejuvinating for the soul. I gave this book five stars because the author writes of things that pertain to everyone's life, including my own."
5,An Inspiring Read!,A great inspiring book! I especially enjoyed Kristina's poems. They described her daily struggles purely from the heart. Kristina is witty and writes with a humorous flair. Her book is a well-written daily journal of raising a family and going to school. God and Coffee was fun to read and I could relate to her stories. The bible verses at the end of each chapter was a nice touch to sum up the chapter's message. An excellent spiritual read!
2,Not Quite a 2003 Edition,"Almost false advertising. Perhaps the other two items are ""2003"" editions, but the atlas itself is circa 1997. I wanted something up-to-date and got the stone age."
1,Keep searching,I found the user interface to be nonintuitive and very clumsy to use. Very little detail. Would not zoom close enough to be usefull. I threw my copy in the trash.
2,"False advertising, don't buy it","This software is not what I expected at all. It comes with three CD-ROM's that date back to 1997. The atlas it has is literaly just maps, which are extremely hard to navigate. It includes an Earth CD that is all old, which doesn't have too many things on it. It's ""3-D"" CD is all really old and outdated. If you want a real atlas buy something else, maybe something newer. Don't buy it, and if you do you'll regret it. Honestly, it's just a waste of money."
2,Book okay but CD is worthless!,"This book does an okay job at showing the basics of Access in a few lessons. However, the CD is worthless. I was not able to do the exercises in the book because of the CD. Finally, I built my own database so I could follow along with the exercises in the book."
3,Didn't Have the Flow I Hoped For,"I tried both this dvd (Yoga: Relief from Neck and Shoulder Pain) and one by Gary Kraftsow called Viniyogatherapy for the upper back, neck, and shoulders each for the first time this week. Maybe it is just my style, but I prefer the Viniyoga so much more! It has a flow to it, while being very clear in it's instruction and it's simply pleasant to do. This one is too slow for me, yet with less clear instruction. I grew bored with it early on. Plus, it did not have as therapeutic an effect for me. If you are a beginner, though, you might appreciate the ultra slow pace here."
1,"Fine singing, horrible direction","The opera video club I run was really looking forward to this DVD, especially as many of us are Handel fans. Unfortunately, we only made it about 40 minutes in before we had to turn it off! The singing is not the problem, it's the rolling on the floor that drove us crazy. Maybe it seemed like a fresh idea in 1996, but it doesn't now!Don't be fooled by the glorious colors and the intriguing postmodern-retro-baroque production. The end result is that each of the characters ends up an unappealing caricature, someone you really don't care about. This one rolls on the floor all the time, that one tongues his walking stick in a lewd manner all the time... Enough said. Now you have various opinions, and you'll have to make up your own mind...We did enjoy the ENO's production of Xerxes, though, in case you're looking for an alternative."
3,Turn off the television set and enjoy,"This film features marvelous music and gorgeous voices. Everything else about it is awful. The costumes, representing all sorts of periods, are a joke. The lighting is dark and terrible. The staging is designed to make you forget the music and the voices and wonder only if Leslie Garrett will have a climax and if she will avoid Christopher Robson's eager tongue and anxious hands. The dancing, if that's what you want to call it, is simply pointless and pretentious. So, to enjoy this opera, simply listen to it. Turn off the television. By the way, Ann Murray alone is worth the price. What a glory."
1,"Unattractive singers, horrible stage setting","The performance is sung in English, but the original language is Italian. The singers look very unattractive, if not ugly. I know, not every singer can look like Netrebko or Garanca, but there are plenty of attractive looking singers of Baroque music (Didonato, Bartoli, Kermes, Génaux, Antonacci, etc. etc.). But then the singing must be in the original language, which I find much better. I cannot enjoy this production, I find it rather horrible."
4,Fireworks to light up your web sites,"As the title suggests, this is mainly aimed at newcomers to Fireworks MX, but even as someone who has used this graphics program since v3, I found the ""Zero"" section taught me a lot about functions I never knew were there. The ""Hero"" section (written by veteran tutorial writer Joyce Evans) then puts everything to work with some simple, but stunning techniques. In contrast to Fireworks MX Magic (New Riders), which Joyce also contributed a couple of chapters to, the emphasis here is not on big, set-piece projects, but on techniques you are likely to use over and over again - creating highlights, metallic buttons, tabbed menu buttons, enhancing and retouching photographs.Why only 4 stars? The book's in black and white, with only a small section in colour, which really doesn't do justice to the contents. Still, it's very reasonably priced, and good value for money."
1,"Dull, predicatble and ultimately pointless...","""Lost"": Endangered Species is waste of time and money. The book reads like a lame first novel with the ""island"" sections grafted on to make it a part of the ""Lost"" franchise. The main character, Faith, is so naive and spineless that it is hard to have any sympathy for her whatsoever. She is manipulated and abused consistently by the men in her life, her contact with the TV show characters on the island is minimal, and the ""resolution"" of her tale is totally underwhelming. Let this book (and others like it) stay lost..."
1,This Book Should Get Lost!,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this book was not worth the money to purchase or the time to read. There was little interaction with the castaways we know and love; Sun & Jin were completely absent. I didn't care much for Faith with her talk about ""beautiful snakes."" Doesn't she know that man's antipathy to snakes dates back to the Garden of Eden? It was obvious that George was afraid of the spider, but she wasn't at all understanding. And she was naive not to suspect that Oscar and the others were up to something in Australia. I hope the next books are better, but they have to be. They can't be worse."
1,I've read better fanfic,"I bought this book because I thought it would be about the characters I have a vested interest in. I don't care about the anonymous background extras that populate the show, I want Jack or Sawyer or hell, I'll even take Kate. I've read other book series based on TV shows and they concentrate on the main characters. If the creators of this show are so afraid of allowing outside writers to mess with their canon, then they should not have greenlit this book series to begin with. Save your money and watch a rerun."
2,As bad as the first one,Things do not improve with this second book. Maybe the plot is more interesting b ut the style is as disgusting as in the first book.
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!!!,BUYING THIS BOOK WOULD BE A WAIST OF TIME AND MONEY.DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE!
2,"Amusing, Very amusing.","Amateur writing.This book seems to be written for pure comical entertainment, because I just can't stop laughing. Perhaps some desperate editor found this series on a Fan Fiction website since that's all it really is. When I purchase books I don't only hope for a good plot but for good writing, like most people I'd assume. This book doesn't show either of those. Now I've given the novel two stars because I am a pious `Lost' fan and love to hear the story from other people's point of view and it wasn't totally incomprehensible."
4,A Good Start to the Series of Books,"This first in the series of novels based upon the TV show does a good job of introducing us to one of the other survivors on the island. Yes, it is a bit predictable, but I'm glad to finally learn about the other people on the island, the one's who fill in the background spaces. Faith Harrington, the ""heroine"" of ""Endangered Species"" interacts with the core group of survivors but has her own demons and her own odd experiences on the island. And, just as with the TV show, we learn through flashbacks how she ended up on Flight 815.If you're expecting huge revelations about the show or want Pulitzer-prize writing, this book more than likely isn't for you. But if you take it for what it is, ""endangered Species"" makes a great companion to the TV series."
5,"Fluff, but good fluff","This is a quick read, good for in between seasons and a look at what is going on with other survivors. Yes, sometimes it's trite, but you know what? It's a fun read and true LOST fans will enjoy this."
2,Take for what it is worth,"""Endangered Species"" by Cathy Hapka is okay book but you have to take it for what it is. It's a 200 page book for 5.99 that is trying to cash in on the ""Lost Craze."" Yes, you see some of the main characters, but the focus on the book character that was made up the writer. It was okay, but some true Lost fans should pass and hope that we will see better books in the future."
3,Good read...,...but nothing to go crazy about. A bit predictable. The character of Faith is very simple. Is hard to beleive someone could be so naive. Some of the main characters on the show have brief mentions. The book made me glad Faith is not a regular in the show.
1,Got it for Free - And I still want my money back,"Maybe the other folks were kinda harsh, but the book is a classic example of the ""rush-to-market"" syndrome. The author could barely have seen the entire series before rushing this book out. I wouldn't even blame the author, just a bad marketing cash-in. Good solid writing, and not uninteresting, just dosen't capture the ""Lost"" energy. For sure, you would be better off spending your 6 bucks on a classic sci-fi paperback then getting this unfortunate 'novelization'."
3,Great movie with fitting music,The movie was great. The music while working with the movie very well isn'tquite as good for listening purposes.
4,"Very good quality, but beware to those with intentions of actually playing it!","It's a very good-looking, solid vinyl, but however has one setback: It didn't fit on my standard sized vinyl player! It may be a size issue with the phonograph, but I had anticipated to play it and it didn't work, which was disappointing, but the vinyl in itself is very good!"
4,"My favorite single from the ""Disintegration"" album era","The single for Cure's ""Fascination Street"" has two versions of the song: Remix (4:17) and Extended Remix (8:48). Both of these sound pretty much the same, but one is longer. We are also treated with two B-side tracks. ""Babble"" (4:16) is a speedy, chipper little tune. Overall, it is a simple song, but will be a treat for any Cure fan. ""Out of Mind"" (3:51) has a slightly different sound to it than other songs from the ""Disintegration"" album era, but probably is good enough to have been included as part of the album. After a 1.5 minute instrumental introduction, we have another chipper, fast-pace song with pretty simple repeating lyrics. The re-mixes of ""Fascination Street"" are nice, but the two B-sides are what make this single worth getting."
3,Naxos did this properly,"I agree with the comments made by Flesh And Wine below. The lousy sound quality is particularly infuriating because the sound is much better on the Naxos CD(8.554096-97)release of this performance. The CD also includes the libretto in both Italian and English.It's unfortunate that subtitles are usually only provided for operas. I find they greatly add to my enjoyment of any long vocal works such as oratorios, passions, and song cycles."
3,"Holly,Jolly?? Not!!!","I was hoping to read a nice Christmas murder when I bought this book, instead I'm involved with Druids & winter solstice with not a holly in sight. Or a jolly. I did like the problems that Claire's teenage daughter always seems to be getting herself involved with. It's a wonder Claire has any hair left after pulling it out over Caron. I enjoy Joan Hess's writing & her characters so I'll keep reading her series even if sometimes her titles are a tad misleading."
2,Disappointing - seemed to have no conclusion,"While I enjoyed all of the Claire Malloy book series, I found this one wanting. The ending was not satisfying but incomplete and not up to author's standards. Hopefully, the next one will leave the reader feeling satisfied."
2,The Subplot Was Better Than the Plot,"A pretty awful book altogether. I love the Claire Malloy series, but this novel totally missed. I never could figure out why Claire cared for the fates of those appalling secondary characters, each one more loathsome than the next, including a bunch of tiresome Druids (a plot convention indicative of a desperate mystery author). Her daughter's misadventure with the mall Santa Claus was much more interesting."
3,Very Verbal-Little Plot,"If you like the mysteries which play on words then this one is for you. The story line wasn't anywhere nearly as complex as the language. Many puns, word plays and an investigator that talks to herself if no one else is around because that is how important the word play is in this book. If you prefer more crime and detection you will not like this one."
5,Ethereal music,"Switchblade Symphony can be compared with Siouxsie and the Banshees.Serpentine Gallery is a fusion of orchestral sounds with heavy synth sequences and ethereal vocals.Switchblade Symphony disbanded in November 1999After the band parted ways, vocalist Tina Root started Tre Lux.In 2008, Tina Root and George Earth formed SmallHalo."
5,classic 70's eloy,"Great album. Nice melodies, hooks, interesting flow. I've been a fan of eloy since the late 70's when I heard their first two albums. This album is style wise more like their later 70's work, not as hard and edgy as the first two albums. more like Ocean and Power and the Passion. Recommend for any Eloy fan."
4,Great music,"This album has been a huge surprise for me. Excellent music, some Floyd-influenced tunes as usual, one of their best efforts ever. Bonermann proves to be one of the most inventive guitarrists I have ever heard. Did not give it five stars because the band repeat some tunes in a couple of songs, but I recommend this cd to progfans!!!!!"
3,Hard to Find Item,"Cute flashlight for Cookie Monster fans. A little too hard for a two year old to turn on and off, but child will like the noise it makes, and what kid doesn't like a flashlight?"
5,Best Blues Rock Album of all Time,"The first 8 tracks of this constitute the best string of blues rock on any album of all time. Between Kal's incredible voice and searing but tasty guitar riffs, Tony Padlers unbelievable Hammond B3 organ, Alan Diaz's steady beat, and Kal's wife Lori Bono's backup vocals, there isnt a better recording made. Since Kal and Lori sold their club Blue Guitar, that makes this recording all the more special since you cant go find them live much anymore. This cd I give to people who like good music and they always say WOW that was great, where did you find this, who is this guy. Its hard to pick the best track but if forced Shadows Across the Land is the topper. Turn this on and amaze your friends."
1,Lousy product & worse customer service - BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered three of this item, Since the seller advertised this item as a 3-pack of filters, I presumed I would 9 filters. I received 3 physical filters. In addition, they were shipped in a plastic pouch and arrived at my home in terrible shape. Only one of the filters was usable. When I inserted the filter into the humidifer and added water, the filter portion of the filter litterally started to peal off the wire mesh inside the filter to keep its shape.I contacted the seller and they indicated they would correct the order and ship the remainding filters. That was weeks ago...nothing shipped and no further contact from the shipper."
4,AC 818 Filters,"I was not able to find these locally, Great price for three of them. I cant say much about the filters except they are working fine and I wont have to find replacement for a couple years"
4,Priced right LOOKS GREAT!!,First time buyer for this brand. I will be back. Looks much more expensive. Positive comments from friends.
5,Just try to forget Kay Francis!,"This is a well written book. Being a fan of classic films, I'm pleased that Scott O'brien included so much information on her work as well as well as her personal life. I felt like I really caught the essence of Kay Francis after reading this book. It would have been so easy for Mr. O'brien to have taken the low road and focus on the unhappy aspects of her life. I believe he created a whole and balanced portrait of this beautiful and talented woman. Congradulations on a job well done. I recomend this book to anyone with an interest in film history."
5,Kay Francis,"I've only seen three of her films and thought her elegant and charming.But now feel I know her. Scott O'brien couldn't have written a more loving portrait of this almost forgotten actress. I think perhaps she would be pleased that her story is told so candidly and thoroughly. We know so much about the 'greats'; Garbo, Grant, Bogart...Kay deserves to be with included with them again. Her generous and earthy spirit will live on...thanks to the author.I hope that many will get a chance to know her too."
2,MEDIOCRE,"This book proved to be disappointing. The author adores Kay Francis (perhaps too much), but he has no grasp of film history or the times in which she lived. The book is only about the actress and provides no details on what else was happening in Hollywood or the world. The illustrations are poor quality and also disappointing. It seems a rush job with little perspective or care for the final product."
4,An Incredible Job of Research and Writing,"Scott O'Brien has pulled off an amazing feat. Kay Francis lived a vigorous and, for the time, unconventional life that could easily be turned into the sleazy tabloid fare all too common (and popular)today. Yet O'Brien has managed to present a vivid, highly readable, and scrupulously researched account without a single trace of nudge-nudge-wink-wink salaciousness or its nearly as unpleasant opposite, sychophantic can-do-no-wrong fan worship. I confess I had started reading with the plan to hop-skip to films I know and love, but I found myself engrossed on every page. I have long been a great fan of Miss Francis's films, but I now appreciate her work far more. (The ONLY small flaw with the book is the typos noted by other reviewers, but this could easily be fixed in a subsequent edition.) The writing is bright and lively. The pictures are great. The author's ability to present a complex and fascinating personality in the context of her times is superb."
5,Enjoy the music,Please excuse the vagueness (and cheasieness) of this review but I can't say anything more than buy the album if you want to listen to a soundtrack of great music that takes the listener on a journey through emotions and landscapes. Beyond excellent.
4,Whales and Nightengales,I first heard this album in January 1970. I thought it was very romantic and gave me a curl-up and cuddle kind of feeling. Liked the music layout of the album especially the variations of the Nightengale I and II with Farewell to Tarwathie. Amazing Grace was a great send off at the end of the album. I have also heard the Wildflower album which is also good but not as good as this one. I own Colors of the Day which I would also rate 4 stars and Judy Collins -Living which also has a wonderful song mix. Hope you all enjoy Whales and Nightengales as much as I do.
4,Judy the Nightingale,"Judy Collins' Whales and Nightingales was the type of music that reached beyond all the specialized niches of the seventies and presented an eclectic mix of Pop, Folk, World Music before there was anything by that title, gospel, and then her work of mourning over the loss of her relationship with Stephen Stills: Nightingale I. It is a story about the loss of faith. It is Nightingale II that moves me emotially. Basically an instrumental rendition of Nightingale I, the orchestrated song take us to another plane.Amazing Grace, Simple Gifts,and all the others. I belive this is a perfect Judy Collins Album."
5,Glad I got it!,"After browsing through various Shower Curtains, I finally settled on the Croscill brand. Now I just had to choose which of the many styles! I am glad I chose this to go with my brownish theme, and it goes great with it! The quality of the curtain is just awesome. Nice and thick, yet very soft. The slits in the curtain, for the shower hooks, are stitched very well to cope with constant tugging on the curtain. This curtain will easily handle some abuse.Edit: Just a follow-up. 5 years later and this curtain is still running strong with no problems. I've only washed it a few times, and it still looks, feels, and works great!"
4,A great talent,"For a man of 23 years of age this album is frighteningly good. Considering we wrote the songs as well it just shows how good british soul is at the moment. Whilst evryone waits for the release of D'angelo's new album Lynden has banished that thought from there heads. This album makes the highly overated Sh*t that is Lauryn Hill look silly. I saw Lynden in concert, in Brighton last week and he took the crowd by storm, he is even better Live if that is possible. I look forward to any future releases from Britain's number one soul man. Keep it real Lynden and keep playing at the smaller venues they are quality. Show us what you've got and please put that new track ""Jasmine"" out soon, it's pure class."
3,A Basic Introduction to Programming and Java,"I picked up this low price book as a ""project oriented"" method in which to begin Java programming, using other books as core reference material. This book is not designed for that purpose, as it is instead an introductory book to programming, using the Java language.Personally, this book was not for me since I use C++ professionally and wanted to try my hand at a few small Java projects. That said, I wish I had this book when I was in my high school computer class. The first 100 pages offer an introduction to variables, binary data, and arrays, while the next 100 pages discuss if statements, loops, methods and classes. The last section in the book briefly goes into Java graphics.So, if you are new to programming and want an introductory book that offers good coverage (but not much depth) for a variety of basic (but necessary) computer programming topics then this would be a good resource. Otherwise I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
1,"A worthless book, probably written in a weekend.",Save your money. It's a shallow tutorial with no significant depth. Makes me wonder if these two authors actually even know Java.
3,Nice and Fancy... but....,"PRO: Beautiful watch, looks sharp. Great for dressing up. No one else has one. What the heck, it was given to me as a gift.CON:1)Self winding only lasts 31 hrs before it dies, so if you don't wear it over the weekend, it's dead on Monday.2)Crown unscrews all the time. Gotta check it. Mine unscrewed and then broke off. (right before a 28day month & daylight savings, so now I cant fix the date and time).3) Heavy and really thick (3/8""+)"
2,Only good for outdoor recording,"This camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. In indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad. I tried to record in my living room where I have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred. In outdoor recording in a sunny day, picture quality is quite good with sharp colors. Zoom works well."
4,Overall a Good unit,We have used this for a few years. It is a good quality camera and does well filming my daughter and other family. The editing software that comes with it is low end. The porcess needed to get it on the PC is time consuming and a pain. The video quality is lowered when put on the PC for editing. I ended up using an Adobe editor that is great but as stated above editing on a PC lowers the quailty in the transfer. Happy with the camera not happy with output options.
2,"Only ""adequate""","I purchased this at a garage sale, still in it's original box, for a great price. It had only been used a few times. It sat for a few months, during which time I got married, and moved to my new husband's house. I started using this camcorder in May when our circle-track racing season began. We race 2 trucks, and my husband likes to review the video's to see how driving patterns can be changed. We are able to watch the videos on TV with no problem, but, since the software did not come with the camera, we have to buy new discs quite often. I contacted Panasonic about the software, and they advise that ""it is not available for 4-6 weeks."" HUH?? You cannot buy this anywhere except Panasonic - you'd think they'd have copies of the software in stock. I have tried other editing programs to no avail, and am just totally fed up and disgusted with it. I think I'll go back to using our old bulky camcorder... at least I won't be spending a small fortune on the discs."
2,SD Functionality Misnomer - beware!,I'll be quick:Everyone else covered everything else about it so...Major drawback is that this palmcorder will not record motion video straight onto the SD Card at all; it only saves the still pictures (VDR-D200) taken by it onto the SD.What a major bummer and Panasonic should be 'spanked' for this one while charging the consumers a FORTUNE for it!I for one would prefer a USB palmcorder with SD backup option.This is a trick-camera for magician actors! BOOOOH!! >:P
1,Antiques Roadshow Insider more like a flyer than a magazine,"My wife just received her first copy of the Anitques Roadshow Insider ""magazine"" which I gave her for Christmas. It took about 2 months from the time I placed to the order to the arrival of the first issue. She was sorely disappointed to find that the so-called magazine was a total of 8 pages, printed both sides. It is printed on a newsprint type of paper, not slick like a normal magazine. I'd say it is worth about 50 cents an issue, not the $3.50 per issue I paid. It's got some good information, but there's not much of it, definately not worth the price!"
2,jipped,"this is a very thin half dozen page newsletter on cheap copy paper that should be a free download.poorly done to shameful effect i'm embarassed,i gave as a gift to an excited fan and feel humbled by this crapy excuse so don't be fooled you are paying for a magazine and getting copy paper blurred images for$5 an issue,sad"
2,Mostly Useless,"I bought this footrest as a part of my ergonomic-desk-conversion. It's somewhat useful, but for $30 I would not buy it again. It's also not very sturdy. However, I'm not going to return it either.PROS:The product appears exactly as it does in picture - gray plastic and black rubber covering on top.The bottom has rubber coverings on it not to scratch the floor/ keep it from sliding around (not a concern for carpet, but still a nice feature).It's really easy to use it and to adjust its height.The base is really large and fits both feet comfortably.CON:I wish I could bring up the footrest higher.After a few weeks if I pressed a little too hard on it, it started clicking and would go back down in levels.Not worth $30."
1,this thing is crap,I bought this foot rest this year and use it quite a bit in my office. There is a foot pedal to lock it. The screws that hold the lock in place have both fallen out. 1 I was able to find and put back in but the other one is lost. Haven't followed up with the company yet so not sure how that will go. The smell that people have commented on was definitely there but not that bad for ours. Also it is kinda difficult to switch the height on it. Once its set and locked with screws it works fairly well althought the height is kind of annoying. They have it color coded and have you set the height according to the size of your hand which was weird. All of the heights took some getting used to before it became comfortable.follow up: I emailed the company to send me replacement screws and they let me know they don't manufacture these individually and refered me to best buy or any other store that sells office accessories. Awesome...
2,Smells like new shoes,"I read all the reviews about the smell of the product, and I still went ahead and bought it. Guess what? They were RIGHT. It smells like I walked into a shoe store, it's not THAT horrible, but it is noticeable. My only issue was the instructions...picture instructions, one side had a hand print chart. Really? No words? No nothing? It doesn't take a scientist to figure it out, but still. Try words. Overall, it's alright, nothing special or magical, but much better than the old Amazon packaging box I was using, RIP. I would probably get something else if you're in the market looking...this isn't super amazing, it isn't all that bad either."
2,Broke immediately!,"Took it out of the box, followed the instructions..and the plastic piece that locks it in place broke. Luckliy I only need the shortest height and the frontmost tilt, so I can still use it, but for anyone who wanted to adjust it, it would be garbage...pass on this one."
2,horrible odor!,"The footrest itself is very comfortable and it allows you to adjust height and angle, but whats the point if I can't breathe? It has such a horrible odor, and being pregnant, it is making me even more nauseous! Going to return this one!"
5,"Comfortable, good for my home office","I like this product a lot, for two reasons:-- The soft plastic top is quite comfortable on my bare feet, unlike the hard plastic ones I've had before.-- If you unlock the lever, it will rotate back and forth with your feet. I like to change position a lot (sit forward, lean back, etc.) so this is quite nice.-- Adjusts up very high (good for me because I am 5', so my desk is much too high). Note that when it first comes out of the box, it is adjusted to its lowest setting...turn the nobs on the sides and it will go up several more inches.I was worried that I would hit the adjustment lock by accident with my feet. However, I do not have this problem. I find that the lever is a few inches behind my heels and I'd have to go out of my way to kick it."
1,Foot constantly unlocks lock tab,"Very disappointing. The lock tab that is used to enable you to unlock and readjust using your feet (without crawling under the desk) is too easily inadvertently unlocked as you move your feet around on the platform. When this happens, the platform pivots back and forth willy-nilly until you relock it. This must happen 2 or 3 times a day, and it is getting old real fast."
4,Decent Product,"I bought it for my mom, who works via home office. It seems to do its job, and I'm pretty sure she's happy with it. I'm not sure that the cost was appropriate for a plastic foot rest that moves up and down and tilts."
2,Ruturned Product,I ordered the wrong product thinking this was a heated footrest. It was mailed back to the supplier almost 3 weeks ago and I have had no word if they received it.
1,I'd give it one star if I could.,"The knob on the side just turned around and around--it didn't do anything! Furthermore, the instructions were drawings only, so it made it difficult to figure out what you were supposed to do."
3,Footrest,The footrest to very large so it is difficult to fit under a desk. The 'easy' adjustments require picking it up to reset it. I also felt for the price it was rather cheap plastic.
3,Cheaply made but not bad for the price.,Very cheaply made and doesn't seem like it will last long. My biggest gripe is that my foot is always hitting that center button that releases the footrest to move. So I have to readjust several times a day and it is a bit annoying.
4,An essential piece of equipment,"This footrest provides an important ergonomic aid to seating posture at desk and computer. Well made and versatile, should be used at all times."
2,Amazon lists this among their *heated* foot rests.,"If you search Amazon for ""heated foot rest"", this is among the first items that come up in the results. It of course doesn't say it's heated in the description once you pull it up, but it's worth pointing out that Amazon will tell you it is. Technically, it's my error for not anticipating that Amazon would miscategorize it. Hopefully this will help one or two others avoid the same user error."
2,Broken out of the box,"I received this product broken out of the box. It is cheaply made and not very sturdy and I am only 5'5, 130lbs. I liked the gel top but it's not worth it if it doesn't work. It's also not all that easily adjustable (although that was the part that was broken)."
3,Stinky,"The foot rest works very well. But the fresh rubber odor is offensive. I've kept it outdoors - in the sunshine. I washed it with water, vinegar, cologne, talcum powder. That's one stubborn odor, but it is bearable now."
3,Just didn't get into it...,Not sure why I couldn't get into this book other then the fact that the story was a little too slow for me. I actually gave it to page 187 but I was just too bored so I had to move on. Couldn't rate it lower because it may have got better & I couldn't rate it higher because I think I should've been pulled into the story by then but I wasn't. Sorry to say but I can't recommend this book.
1,Disappointing Product,"My wife thought it would be a nifty way to lay-out furniture for a new house but it turned into hours of frustration. It's cumbersome, quirky and not well documented. It comes with a number of sample designs that look quite good which made it all the more more frustrating.At 62 years, I don't figure to live long enough to learn to use it effectivly, especially when you have to tease out many operations by trial & error. We didn't expect too much for $29 and I guess got what we paid for."
2,Did not recieve exact product,In the picture it shows chains attaching to loops which are attached to the punching bags the punching bag i recieved had straps attached to the bag not 4 chains 4 cloth straps... Amazon really wtf?
3,LUKEWARM DEBUT,"WHEN IT COMES TO CARLY SIMON ALBUMS, I NEVER KNEW QUITE WHAT TO THINK OF THIS, HER DEBUT ELEKTRA RELEASE. STRANGELY ENOUGH, SIMON SEEMED TO HAVE A BIG COUNTRY INFLUENCE ON THIS RECORD (WHICH PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO ME HAVE SUCH AN IFFY OPINION ABOUT IT, AS I DON'T GENERALLY LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC ALL THAT MUCH). STILL, THIS RECORD DOES CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE MASTERPIECE, HER BREAKTHROUGH HIT, ""THAT'S THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS HEARD IT SHOULD BE"", WHICH DEALS WITH HER RESERVATIONS ON THE PRESSURES OF MARRIED LIFE. BUT THAT SONG IS WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS RECORD: THAT SONG IS SO GREAT, ALL THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE MEDIOCRE IN COMPARISON. THE ALBUM ISN'T DEVOID OF GOOD POINTS, HOWEVER. ""THE BEST THING"", ""ANOTHER DOOR"", AND ""REUNIONS IS A SONG POSSESSING A CERTAIN ACHING PURITY TO IT THAT I FIND BOTH SAD AND INTRIGUING. ALL AND ALL, THIS IS BY FAR NOT HER BEST ALBUM (THAT HONOR WOULD HAVE TO GO TO EITHER ""NO SECRETS"" OR ""HOTCAKES)BUT STILL HAS ENOUGH GOOD MATERIAL TO JUSTIFY ITS PURCHASE."
2,if you miss vinyl - this one's for you!,"The only reason this CD got any stars at all is because the music itself is wonderful. It's no wonder Cover Girl won an Oscar for musical score, it's upbeat sunny and perfect. Songs such as ""I'm Old Fashioned"" and ""Long Ago and far Away"" are timeless love songs.However, the quality of this CD is poor at best. From what I could tell the recording is done in mono. When I first put the CD on and queued up the first track I thought somehow my CD player had been transformed into a Victrola. The sound was scratchy, hissy and tinny. If the producers of this video were looking to capture authentic old-time sound, they got it.Fromn what I've been able to find this is the only recording of the Cover Girl soundtrack, which is a real shame. Music of this caliber deserves better treatment."
1,The worst CGI animated movie you'll ever watch...,"I have no idea how this movie was a hit. Oh wait, because it is totally shamless, filled with endless pop culture references, and features overly cartoony animation.Expressing how boring the movie would be hard. Nothing in the movie was funny, engaging, anything. It was just endless gags about ""New York Giants,"" and poor animation. Nobody will remember this movie in 10 years, no one. They will turning on ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars,"" or even the recent ""How To Train Your Dragon"" instead. Unlike those movies, this one didn't try to have good story and characters, it just went for the lowest of the low. Only Happy Feet was more untolerable."
5,it's great!!! alot better than incredibles.,"ok first i want to say incredibles was just kinda not really bad but i don't like it as much as the other movies but the trailer looked like it was going to be good on finding nemo and in that one it was just an excuse to remake 'spy kids"" but this one is actually funny and fresh i don't remember it copying anything else except cast away but that's all but they also manage to make it funny. some of the jokes are funny ok?"
1,I thought it was rehashed crap,There are a lot of good cartoon movies out there.This one is just another rehash of the same ideas.Try renting before buying.
2,Has it's moments but not overall great ..more focuses on the younger audiences and was not funny,"Well this is no Shrek, Findidn Nemo oh wait it's not like most animated films oh wait it is better then Shark's Tale. I found this film to focus more to the younger ages and focuses to much on the naimation and the voces and not on the story. The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting."
3,Disappointing,"I found this movie to be extremely boring, however as an adult I cannot say whether or not it would be entertaining for children. I enjoyed Melman, he really made the movie get three stars,however the rest of the plot really never grabbed my attention. Overall, I was expecting a movie as entertaining as Shrek, but Madagascar was far from meeting my expectations."
5,Madagascar,I watched the movie with a 4 year old. It was enough on his level that he got it and it had enough adult humor to keep my attention.
3,Madagascar,"I thought this movie was ""just okay."" It's good if you want to pass the time. Kids will like it. Adults may want to fall asleep."
3,Boring.,Zoo animals forced to survive in the wild. Sounds good. Some funny parts but overly-sensitive overtones. I guess it was kind of fun in parts but the moral of the story ruined it for me.
2,Bland amusement,"OK, it's a fair story. There are lots of good-buddy moments, where friends do all they can to keep their friends happy, and even a sermonette about loving the people who matter even when they're very hard to love. There are wild personalities, inane hijinx and cute cuddly animals. You know, the usual.There are kids' movies that that reach out to the grownups too. Then there are kids' movies just for the kids, and maybe not for the brightest among them. This bit of fluff is one of the latter, unfortunately. There's nothing actually wrong with it - but there's nothing memorably right about it, either.-- wiredweird"
3,Had enough talking animals with dumb plots movies.,"This movie is about four animals that live in the zooAnd one of them Marty(Chris Rock)Really want toogo and live in the wild.He gets his wish afterEscaping and some other things and him and his friendsMelman,Gloria, and the lion (cant remember his name)Get Shipped off to Madagascar.I found it ratherboring I guess I'm just getting too old for theseanimated talking animals movies But it was funnyin parts I really liked the part when the lionsaid Shut up Spalding!I also reccomend Ice age."
2,Very tragic...,"This movie had such potential! Technically speaking, the plot is clever & the characters unique, but the dialogue is stilted & doesn't flow smoothly. There are a few laughs involved, & occasional clever phrases, but as a result of the poor craftsmanship, it's a mediocre movie--just like the preview foretold."
2,Foosa...,"I didn't think much of ""Madagascar"". It sees a bunch of animals escape from Central Park Zoo, New York, only to be captured, deported, shipwrecked, and caught up in Lemur/Foosa politics on Madagascar and the instincts of the wild. It felt more like a TV special than a movie, and didn't really have much of an ending. I found the style of jokes kind of tired, just let me down a bit. Special features include some new footage of the penguins, among other things."
3,An average DreamWorks release.,"I really wanted to see this because of all the hype surrounding it. I thought the characters were cute and there were a few funny parts in it, but that's where it ends for me. It wasn't all that entertaining of a film. I think children would like this (I'm in my 20's), but it wasn't my cup of tea, I was rather disappointed."
4,"Excellent Family Film -- Gotta Move It, Move It!","Caught Madagascar on TBS, sadly complete with commercials. Great entertainment about city bred animals, and one particular zebra who wants to escape to the Wild, which might be just south of Connecticut!It's collision of friendship and predator instincts makes for an unusually gripping conflict.The most fun for me was the allusions to TV shows and old movies. If you watched Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes, even Chariots of Fire and Wild Kingdom, you'll know what I mean. How many can you spot!It would be a fun Lunch game to see how many allusions you can spot.The story is cute, kids will like it. And adults will recognize a lot of music and movie allusions. Great way to waste a couple of hours. Can't wait for Madagascar 2.Also recommend:Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen)The Shrek Trilogy (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third) (Full Screen Edition)"
4,Funny,"Its a funny movie at first-especailly the ""hell"" part. Kids will like it.Adults might but its more of a kids movie."
3,Not as good as Shrek 2,"I thought this was better than Shrek 1, but it is worse than Shrek 2. The animation isn't as delightful and well-done (plasticy) and some of the jokes are tiresome. Overall it is a really cute movie, esp. for kids, because the saving characters are Gloria the Hippo and Melman the Giraffe, as well as the lemurs AND...THE CUTE PENGIES! (PENGUINS). It's funny, it was a good attempt, but not up to the Shrek2 or Pixar caliber."
4,Lots of Fun!,"This film is as good as Shrek, with humour for little kids and us big kids as well. The penguins are awesome and the lemurs are hilarious! I would see it again and my 7 year old is already asking."
4,A Laugh,This movie is full of cute critters and WILD dancing lemurs! Add that all together and you've got a great hit children's movie!
4,Penquins stole the show!!!,Liked the movie quite a bit! The penquins were fun and being a NYC born and raised senior I enjoy NY scenes even in animation.
2,Utterly forgettable,"I'm sorry, but this film wasn't all that great. Yes, there were a few laugh out loud moments, such as the leamur king and the skelleton arm, however, overall i found myself bored through just about all of it.The plot isn't really anything new: Marty the Zebra wants to leave his life at the zoo and live in the wild, but his friends want to stay put. THere is a little bit of conflict between the Zebra and his LIon friend, but it's trivial and almost stupid.When this movie was finished I was left with a feeling of ""Okay, that was a big waste of time."" My brother loved it and I'm sure other little kids will find it funny, but for me it just didn't work well at all."
3,Not as funny as I thought,"This movie isn't as good, funny and exciting as I thought it was gonna be. The best part in the whole movie for me is the one with more funny scenes, more action and jokes, and that part happened to be the first sequence, when the animals are in the zoo. If you watch the trailer, most of it happens in the zoo, and only a couple of scenes in the trailer are in the island, and it looks really funny.When I watched it, I thought it may have been funnier, but it's quite boring, instead. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this movie to kids, because it's very ""innocent"".If you want to watch an animated movie which is cool for the whole family, watch ""The Incredibles"", instead of this one, instead of ""Shrek"""
3,funny but not kid attention grabbing,"The adults found the movie funny, the kids liked it some, but they were bored through a lot of it. The movie did not hold their attention like some of the best kids films do."
2,Not good for kids,"The Movie Madagascar is terrible for children. It teaches them to spit, use words such as freak, etc. I would not recommend this for children."
4,Very Entertaining!,"Great movie for kids and parents alike. Our 3 year old absolutely loves animals, so this movie is tops for her!Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good movie for young ones."
4,Cool,"It was a neat movie i realy liked the King Julien guy he is the one who sings ""I like to move it"" I also liked the girafe,Melman he is very funny."
4,Oh My Goodness! That was funny!,"I just went to see this movie last night with some friends, and it was so worth it! The movie shows that it's tough when your (hungry) best friend is your main predator, but the best parts are the lemurs. They like their dancing, and they are so funny! And the movie wouldn't be any fun without the penguins. It's on the par with movies like Ice Age--same type of humor, but with a lot less ice. It's not quite as good as Shrek or Shrek 2, but it's still a really good movie."
3,3 1/2 stars out of 5- A Cute Kiddie Movie-,"This movie is the best work that Dreamworks has come up with since ""Shrek."" The story once again mixes a new fresh idea, cute animation, and a great all-star cast... I enjoyed this movie greatly as well as my younger brother.The story was charming... The characters delightful- i especially like nerotic Melvin- the giraffe and the penguins(I like so many others hope they make an actual movie about the penguins).The special features are amazing... the Christmas penguin short was especially endearing. The information on the cast and the making of was interesting for me- but, then again I'm also thinking of a career in animation.This is definately a movie to own in your collection or to buy for the kid in your life... Hit the buy now button this won't disappoint!"
1,Highly overrated.,"They call this the biggest film of the year, HA! When theysay Hollywood's running out of ideas, they're right! In thepreviews they made it look funnier than a PIXAR film. Whenyou watch the previews it makes you want to say,""I've gottasee that!"" But when you watch it, you want to say,""Why did Iwaist my money on this piece of junk!""And what was with that, "" I like to move it, move it!"" bit?Oh, it had it's funny parts, but it just didn't hold theaudience's attention span. I found the penguins a LITTLEfunny, but it just couldn't get me to laugh.Don't waist your time on this movie!"
1,Don't buy this dvd from Amazon!,"I bought this dvd as new and I got a used copy of this movie, it wasn't sealed. I just happen to look over the other comments on this movie and other people are having the same issue. I've actually never had this happen before from amazon."
1,two dvds inside not blu-ray,"Like others, my copy received two regular dvds and no blu-ray transfer. Pretty darn aggravating... wish I had read the comments on this before ordering, glad I checked immediately and this one is going back for a refund."
1,Animals Leave Babylon (NYC) for Madagascar: Another Speilberg Holocaust Movie?,"Hitler's original ""Final Solution to the Jewish Problem"" was to send the Jews to Madagascar, which I think would have been a better place than Palestine.This movie takes animals from the heart of Babylon (a city of commerce & confusion) on a journey similar to the transports of Jews to the concentration camps.I liked the party animals in Magagascar the best (love to party with 'em, liked the music). Unfortunately, the party is crashed by meat eating cat-like creatures.The only animal that I really liked was the psychedelic zebra. The hippo has a lovely voice, without a body to match. The psychedelic trips the lion took was cool too.Yet, the animals, like Jews escaping slavery with Moses long for the fleshpots of NYC.Loved the animation, laughed a few times but found the movie scary!"
1,OOOOOOOOMaGOD.,"Madagascar pretty much SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I saw this movie and laughed the whole time (not because it was funny, because it was stupid!!)I mean, kicking and screaming was better than this and it was horrible! BAH HUMBUG!!"
1,IT IS KIND OF BABISH........,REALLY STUPID............. IT HAS TO BE THE WORST FILIM MOVIE EVER.MADAGASCAR ISN'T THE BEST MOVIE IN THE YEAR.I SAW THE PREVIES AND.....THE TRAILER.I THOUGHT IT WILL BE THE FUNNIEST MOVIE IN THE YEAR......
3,Madagascar,"At New York's Central Park Zoo, a lion (Stiller), a zebra (Rock), a giraffe (Schwimmer), and a hippo (Smith) are best friends and stars of the show. But when one of the animals goes missing from their cage, the other three break free to look for him, only to find themselves reunited ... on a ship en route to Africa. When their vessel is hijacked, however, the friends, who have all been raised in captivity, learn first-hand what life can be like in the wild.The movie doesn't bring you the same comedy such as Shrek , Toy Story or even Findind Nemo."
3,"Kinda Funny, Kinda Cute, Kinda Boring","I saw this movie with my young cousins (ages 7 & 11) and they both said it was okay, but while better than Shark Tale, it doesn't compare to the Pixar films. There are some funny moments (loved those military Penguins & the lemur king), but I found myself dozing off a couple of times. This is a pretty good one for the kids and would make a good rental instead."
2,Just not very funny!,"This movie just isn't very funny and there's not much to the plot either. Animation is just OK. The lemur and penquin characters are relatively funny, but all the main characters just aren't. The movie fails to hold my 2 year old's attention for more than a few minutes, while he'll watch Finding Nemo and Toy Story in their entirety over and over. There are far better animated films out there for little ones and adults."
5,Greatness!,"I already love M2 and hadn't seen M1 since it came out, this was a great way to refresh my memory and still have the movie for years to come."
5,Good Movie!,A very cute and funny movie.I laughed so hard.A well worth buying movie.5 stars.Buy this one!
4,fun for toddlers,"Even tho I am not sure the 4 and 2 year olds understood the entire movie, they really enjoyed the animals and quick action. They had alot of fun watching it....many times.."
2,Hit&Alot of Miss,"I enjoyed certain parts of this Movie,but there were parts where it didn't have alot of substance whatsoever.the voices were alright,but this film doesn't even come close to other films in the same vein.the directing was nice&I liked the story,but something was just missing for me to fully get into it.not bad,but it should have been way better."
3,madagascar,this is a great movie but i'm not complety sure if this is my favoirte movie. it is sure really funny espessily the penguins. i was laughging so hard i hardly couldn't breath! madagascar pure fun for kids and i got it a three star because i'm not sure if it's the BEST!!!!!
5,Loved it!,"I thought this movie was rather thrilling for a young child's video. The dialogue was hilarious, and the music was extremely entertaining. I found this movie along my friend's DVD collectiona and watched it, amazed at the way it turned out. I personally thought it was going to be another annoying cartoon that became a child fad, but what a shock! It turned out to be better than many movies I have seen for children."
5,It's field trip day,"This is a great movie for the whole family. The 'grown-up' humor is hilarious but well hidden from the youngsters. They'll laugh, you'll laugh...both at the same time, but for entirely different reasons.This is another great movie for rainy days, sleep-overs, or in the car during long trips."
2,"ACK, they must of overpaid the big named actors","And couldnt afford to give it a decent ending or relaly develope a great story and characters...Concept, 5 starscharacters: EH 3 overall, they had some GREAT characters (mainly the penguins), greaty moments. BUT Too many left underdeveloped or actually were too much the ""actors"" who voiced them and not more unique movie characters you can connect with.Beginning of movie: 4 stars...It was cute, it had some funny parts. BUT it was no shrek, or Nemo.Ending 1... I have never been more dissatisfied with a movie ending before. BLAHAnd there are actually some disturbing parts in this movie. WE get that Alex Goes a bit wild but they went overboard on that for a kids movie. I had to give warnings to peers with kids."
2,love the movie dissappointed with untimely delivery,Love the Movie. Ordered it from Amazon for Christmas and didnt get it until middle of February. I had to call Amazon twice. The first time they appologized and told me they would send another movie right away. The movie never arrived so I called again. Very dissappointed with Amazon.
2,Not a good adaptation of Fossas,"For one, the correct name of the cat-like weasel animal is Fossa (pronounced Foo-sa). Secondly, they are not mindless, pack hunters as portrayed in this animated lark.But hard for me to complain about one animal's attributes as the rest are talking, dancing and stealing a ship to Antartica.I am with the rest of the reviewers. The penguins make the movie. My kids liked it, especially my seven year-old son. I thought it was mediocre at best."
1,Disappointed,MOvie stops after about 15 minutes and will not continue. I have tried on three different DVD players and it has a flaw in it
4,Great movie for the whole family,"Although it took me awhile to actually sit down and watch this movie, once I did I didn't regret it. The music is fun, the animation great, and the story entertaining for children and adults alike. The cast couldn't have been better for the characters they played, and you could see a little bit of each actor in the character they voiced. A great movie for spending an afternoon or evening with your kid(s)."
4,Cute movie,"Very funny-esp. if you live in thr tri-state area. Not an elaborate plot line but enough one liners and great characters to make it a funny,light hearted, worth-the-watch movie!"
4,This movie is excellent,"Even adults would like this movie. My 4 year old daughter loved it. This is one that we did not see at the theater when it was out, and it is rare that I will ""buy"" a DVD without having first rented or seen it in the theater, but I just knew my money would not be wasted on this one and I was right. Even my 14 year old son watched some of it. It is too cute!!"
1,discs don't play,"I would like to watch this movie, but the discs don't work. I first bought the Madagascar (Widescreen) DVD. Two different computers and two different DVD media software programs refused to play the disc. I waited a long time and got the Blu-Ray version, which refuses to play on a laptop purchased just last November 2010. The movie is not available on Amazon's video on demand or on iTunes. End result: I didn't get to see it at the theater and don't have more than basic cable. I've now bought two non-working discs. I guess I'll have to wait for it on iTunes or find a friend who has it, because I don't want to be fooled a third time into paying for another disc.Sure, the movie may be great, but I'll never know, because neither the DVD nor the Blu-Ray will play. I feel like I've been robbed twice. I was looking forward to a fun romp of a movie. Maybe if it ever comes on iTunes I can rent it. Bah."
1,disappointed,"I don't know what everyone else see's in this movie but I failed to see anything funny in it. First of all a lot of the humor is way over a little kids head. They wouldn't have the slightest idea what they were talking about. It's like they wanted to make it for the adults to laugh at and forget about the kids. Isn't this a kids movie??? Also it has an incredibly slow start. The first 30 min. of the movie are very boring to say the least, most kids would have already lost interst in this movie before it ever picks up speed. Right when you think things are going to get going with the music and dancing, it stops! Way to much dialoge for little kids and not enough action and music to carry the movie through. SOOOOOOOO disappointed."
1,"""Cracka lackin"" is a derogatory term for ""no whites""","""Cracka"" means ""white people"" and ""lackin"" means ""there aren't any around"". This expression of joy almost defines the zebra's character as he jubilates in it numerous times in the movie. This kind of racism has no place in a children's movie. Dreamworks really should have been more careful with their script."
1,The Train Wreck of the Year,"This was supposed to be a comedy and it was so bad that I couldn't even find humor in how pathetic it was. The writing was horrible!! There was only one laugh for me in the entire film which had something to do with wiping...that always makes you feel good to get one low brow laugh in. haha Ben Stiller in particular was a stand out for his poor voice performance. This guy's career has officially crashed and it's time for him to go away. Everyone involved here was horrible, though. Jada Pinkett, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, the list goes on and everyone deserves to be mentioned for their pathetic decisions to be a part of this mess. I rank every film I see by year and this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years!!!"
3,"OK, but not a keeper","This rather frenetic movie details the life of a group of animals that live in the Central Park zoo, and their misadventures when they accidentally get out of the zoo and end up in Madagascar. The citified critters must learn how to adapt to ""the wild"", and the one with the most trouble is Alex the lion because, well, he's a carnivore.The story is entertaining, in spite of being thin. There are plenty of good movie tributes and musical riffs to entertain the grown-ups. My 13 year old daughter ""got"" the ""Planet of the Apes"" allusion and was very proud of herself. The dancing lemurs had us all singing ""I like to move it move it"" for weeks afterwards, and the criminally insane penguins were truly funny. However, the sequence where it dawns on the herbivorous critters that in the real world carnivores eat cute little duckies was a bit intense.So in all, it was OK and a pleasant diversion but nothing too special. It gets a ""rainy Sunday"" vote."
5,"According to my 7 year old son said , ""It was pretty cool!""",I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed at this move. Very entertaining. One of the better kid's movies we've seen in a while.
5,Am a big kid at heart,I loved this movie and have watched it more often than not without a child present. The item arrived practically new in its packaging. And it came so quickly. I will definitely order from this vendor in the future.
5,Madagascar (Full Screen Edition),There was great delivery time of the product and it plays as stated by the seller. I am pleased with my purchase.
5,Mad-a-gas-car,"I picked this movie up for our daughter since she enjoys Shrek and Shrek II. I thought this movie was very cute and gave the viewer a different side to zoo animals. It starts out as the characters are in the zoo minding their own business when the penguins have an idea to leave the zoo for Antarctica. Marty (the zebra) decides the zoo life is not for him as well. Long story short, they end up getting boarded up and sent to Madagascar and have to survive on the island.It has funny moments, songs, and a good story line."
3,Good Start to a Series,This is great for young children and adults with over active imaginations. I found myself enjoying this along with my son.
2,A Children's Movie With Racist Comments,"This movie, while entertaining, has a racist theme. The phrase ""cracker lackin"" is uttered again and again. Can you imagine the contoversy, if this were an equivilent racial slur against black, or any non-white race of people? I suppose that ""cracker lackin"" means ""a place without white people,"" because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted three stars."
3,Madagascar,"Actually, the second in this series is better than the first although this one sets the story line."
3,Laughs outweigh plot troubles,"Willing suspension of disbelief is essential to watching any movie, play, etc., but all we ask is to not be thrown violently from the experience by things that just don't make sense--even in something that is obviously far-fetched. If you find yourself playing MST3K in your head along with the action, there may be a scripting problem. That said, this is entertaining. The lemurs are a riot. The penguins are a stroke of genius. The ""What a Wonderful World"" scene is bone-crunchingly funny with depressingly horrific levity. Watch it, laugh, but don't expect logical plot construction."
2,WARNING: NO PENGUIN CHRISTMAS CAPER!,"Bought this just to get ""Penguin Christmas Caper"", which in the past was always on the Madagascar DVD. This version DOES NOT have that great Xmas short. Buyer beware and read descriptions more carefully than I did! (Though we like Madagascar, we didn't feel the need to own it, so I am not commenting on the movie itself)"
5,Satisfied customer,I was very pleased with the products and will definitely buy from this website again!
5,A classic!,This is a great kid's movie - I love the fact the both my kids can always agree on watching it (they are 6 1/2 and 3).
3,"Served my purpose well, could use improvement","I bought this because I am hearing-impaired and I needed something to awaken me without disturbing my husband. I use just the bed vibrator without the audible alarm. This has worked very well for me. I think the product could be improved by adding the ability to set different alarm times for each day. I have to remember to turn this off on Friday evening so I am not awakened unnecessarily early on the weekend, and turn it back on Sunday evening to get up for work.This is great if you have a cat that insists on sleeping on your bed and you would rather it not do so. My cat used to sleep on the bed all the time, but this scares her so much she hardly goes near it anymore. This was an unintended side-effect of getting this. Kind of makes me a little sad, actually. I didn't mind her getting in bed with me."
2,Don't go by the Picture,"The picture is very decieving. Im sure the clock is great but you do not get the shaker with it. It is another $30.00 plus S&H.;They also try to throw you off with""built in reciever"", if you are not sure the shaker is the vibrating round piece in the picture.The item was delivered in a timely manner. If you donnt need the shaker you should be good to go."
5,Great product!,Bought this for my sister who is deaf in one ear & has limited hearing in the other. She can hear this alarm because it has an adjustable tone as well as adjustable volume. The flashing lights & vibrator under the mattress also helps (& her mattress is thick). I am so very pleased with this purchase.
5,Excellent bed shaker!,"I bought this alarm clock because my upstairs neighbor doesn't care about home-training her children. So I have to wear earplugs to go to sleep. At first, waking up to all that vibration through a 3000 dollar foam mattress was scary, but now I get up well rested with an annoying pain in my ears from the earplugs."
2,"Nice product , if it works","I am essentially deaf in one ear and needed an alarm that would wake me up. Bought one of the original black models (looks like this one , but black). It worked beautifully for well over 10 years. By that time , the set buttons were almost waorn out and the alarm pulse signal went from the original one to one with short intervals. Ordered a new one like the above from the company. The unit that arrived worked fine for a few days , then the alarm failed. The alarm never went off when set , but the test button worked fine. Problem with the alarm itself. Returned it and a new one was sent (they said the returned one was working fine). New one did the same thing. Went through that cycle several times. They finally sent one of the newer ones with the large display. Hopefully , that one will work!So , while the product is a great idea , there are definite bugs to be worked out. If you get one that works consistently , you're lucky."
1,Light button didn't work,Everything about the alarm was great except for the yellow lamp button as it would not turn the lamp on :( Returned it and got the sweetheart alarm clock which works great!
5,great produce,My son was very hard to wake up and we bought one of these alarm clocks several years ago for him. We have since ordered another one for my daughter. They are loud and the connection to plug in the lamp for the blinking light is great. Highly recommended!
2,Good while it lasts...,"I'm a very heavy sleeper and I bought this alarm for the bed shaker. As far as it goes, the bed shaker worked pretty well... for about 6 months. That's when it sh@t the bed (pun intended). After that happened I just had a very expensive alarm!As an alarm, this isn't that good. The buttons are all mixed in with each other and it is pretty easy to hit the snooze and the off buttons at the same time. Also, they must be using automotive relays to control the vibrator and the outlet for the light. The noise from the relay opening and closing is enough to wake me up sometimes. That's good of course, but it worries me when I hear an electrical device making loud sounds that sound like electricity arcing.BTW, I thought of buying a new bed shaker, but they want more for the shaker than they want for some of the alarms that come with shakers. Go figure!"
3,"Works very well overall, but needs alot of improvements.","My suggestions on improving this item would be to make the little black buttons larger and of a different material. They feel flimsy and started wearing out after several months. They should look and/or feel different from each other too. The placement of the snooze button takes some getting used to because it is not on top of the clock, but on the lower portion of the front. Reliability needs to improve too because it will spontaneously alarm even after you turn the alarm off. I had too start unplugging the shaker and lamp every morning. It also started alarming during the night which also led to unplugging it. I have had this product for less than a year."
3,"Homer Simpson's ""Buy me, Buy me, Buy me""","This Sonic Boom Loud Vibrating Alarm Clock is really loud and it sounds like that homer simpson's episode where he's a car salesman and there is this emergency hurst vehicle that's for sale and his boss told him that the only thing that works is this stupid siren. So the boss turns it on and the sirens screams, ""Buy me, buy me, buy me."" The alarm is okay and that vibrator vibrates like hell! Even my woman likes to play with it. It's too damn vibrant that it shakes the bed like if there's an earthquake. I first bought it cuz my new cell phone wasn't loud enough. So I finally got me a Palm Treo 755 and it works like a charm. It has a loud, pleseantly sounding alarm. So I'm going to give my Sonic Boom to Goodwill this week."
3,Sonic Alert Alram Clock,"The alarm was slightly louder than that of a normal alram, but I wouldn't call it a sonic boom. I was expecting more punch from the name. the vibtrating pad is interesting, but small as well."
3,why the alarm off button?!?!,"If this clock did not have an ""alarm off"" near the snooze alarm I'd rate it a five. It does not need this feature because there is a switch on the side that accomplishes the same. Occaisionally, I finally figured out, I was hitting this small button while fumbling for the snooze button and thus missing out on being awake at the correct time. Not deaf -just a.m. impaired. Also, after one time knocking it on the floor the light feature didn't work anymore. Since I'd had it for a while by that time, I was philosophical."
2,Alarm Clock,This clock is difficult & confusing to set & use. Ours did not last one year. I can not recommend it.
3,Not as loud as I thought it would be,Vibrator works strongWhen plugged in lamp flashes greatBeing able to turn lamp off anytime with a push of a button is niceButtons are easy to read and useCons: It is a little louder than most alarm clocks but the advertisement leads me to think it would of been real loudPretty high price for an alarm clock.Great clock if it holds up
3,Big Boom - Short Life,"This item has been wonderful for the year it has worked. Perhaps those that need all the bells and whistles to wake up have to suffer the consequences that a bunch of bells and whistles give you more to go wrong. I don't think we've ever had an alarm clock die so quickly - but WOW! It actually woke my husband up for the full year! So, regardless of it's longevity - we'll probably replace it with another."
1,"Hmmm, a penny...","Well I guess if you're into boring watered down pop you might like this band. Personally, I think the three cents I payed for all of their albums was too much. I mean, now I have these three jewel cases that I have to do something with."
4,Booty Shakin Fun 4 All,"It's not as raunchy as Volume 4, but has more beautiful women from the dirty south. This video also includes a few new underground hip hop artist from Miami. The best thing I liked about this video is that Luke used a lot of audience participation and with Luke MCing, things always wonderfully get out of hand."
3,Recommend other Corduroy Board Books instead....,"Like so many adapted board books, this particular Corduroy book ends very abruptly to me--there's no plot at all, just a series of activities throughout the day, but that don't occur in any necessary order. The other Corduroy books (some of the holiday books, for example, Corduroy's Day, Corduroy Goes to the Doctor, and Corduroy's Party come to mind) begin at hte beginning of a day or an event, and end at the end, and that makes for a more comfortable read.Still I give this book 3 stars because my 1.5 year old son loves it so much he'd probably give it 5 stars if he could write. ;) So if you, like me, own all of the other Corduroy board books because your kids love them, then they'll probably enjoy this one too. If not, I esp. recommend the Doctor, Corduroy's Day, and the 4th of July books."
2,We-e-e-lll...,"This record is fairly good. I had never known Christopher Lee for a singer - still, his rendition does not compare with actor Lee Marvin's unforgettable one, although the basso voice is agreeable. And, is this really Christopher Lee singing? Lee is British, and this basso voice is unmistakably American. All in all, this is an expensive CD, both for its contents and for its presentation in a skimpy casing. Couldn't the producer afford a better one!"
2,Website shutdown!!!,I think this would have been a great software product but everything refers to the website which has been shutdown. As a reference tool I guess its fine but if you are homeschooling an 8th grader like I am it is of no use without the website. I wish Amazon had not had it up for sale so I would not have wasted my money. Amazon really dropped the ball on this one and I will think twice about buying educational software from them now.
4,Pre 9/11 insights,"I'm on a ""True Escape Stories"" kick right now. In my opinion, the more realistic and the least fantastic the stories are, the better. And that's precisely what you get with ""Over the Edge"". It's a story about how four American climbers escaped from their Muslim terrorist kidnappers. The fact that this all happened prior to 9/11 gave this reader an entirely different insight into what's going on in Iraq today.One strange thing about the book is that the author often refers to himself throughout the book. This made absolutely no sense to me until the later chapters where he actually became an active character in the story. At first I thought he was on some kind of ego trip, but I later realized that the last part of the book would have made no sense at all without his personal information."
3,Climbers refused all interviews,"The reader from California derides those who came to an opinion without first interviewing the participants themselves. The reader from California neglects to mention that the climbers refused to grant interviews in America to anyone other than Greg Child, until after Child published this book. Many journalists therefore were forced to rely on Jason Smith's interview with Agence France-Press and the Associated Press while Smith was still in Kyrgyzstan (before Child struck his book deal). Smith told these reporters that the climbers were abandoned by their captors. It is interesting to note that Jason Smith is not traveling with the Greg Child book tour, attended by all the other climbers."
3,"Do all publicists live in New York, NY?","In Tommy Caldwell's handwritten statement, the statement he penned for the Kyrgyz military, Tommy describes a ""hill"" -- not a cliff. Child's book doesn't mention this. I listened to the Dateline show which said the kidnapper was pushed, but the kidnapper did not say he was pushed down a ""cliff."" No wonder he lived. This book would have been better had Child addressed the little girl whose father was gunned down on a bridge as he tried to rescue the American climbers. The book is great as it describes ""costs of adventure,"" but only as this relates to the Americans who had ignored State Department warnings not to travel to this part of the world. Nowhere does the book address the ""costs of adventure"" to the Kyrgyz child who now has no father as a result. Child's book pretends as though she doesn't exist. Where's the ethics in that?"
3,INNOCENCE REVEALED,"I know nothing about rock climbing and this is the first book I have ever read about the subject. I read the book for the kidnap and escape adventure...and was quite disappointed. The American's experience though unfortunate, I was never a ""grabbed"" reader as the writing did not grab me. As it was divulged, the ""good guys"" knew where the kidnappers were and they were tightening the noose ... slowly. The Americans' lives were in jeapordy at all times, yet when the opportunity arose to escape it took the guts of one man to pull it off, but he was in a personal dilemma because he had to ""kill"" the guard (he thought)and he then couldn't live with himself even though he did save himself and 3 others. His attitude sure seemed dumb to me."
4,Interesting Read,"The book discusses the climbers involved bios, their expedition, terrorist history of the region, and other peoples' experiences in the same region. It also follows up on the aftermath of the kidnapping and the controversy that went with it.I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it to others. At some spots I found it a little slow, but it was at the same time fascinating."
4,gripping,"I thought this book was an excellent read. I had a hard time putting the book down. My only negative, was for two chapters in the book that divulged into the history of the islamic movement and past conlficts. I just thought they were unnecessary, (I actually skipped them). But the rest was very well written. I very much recommend this book."
1,"Not all that ""True"" a Story","As a development worker who lived and worked in Kyrgyzstan during the kidnapping, I can tell you that many parts of this so-called ""True Story"" are very questionable. One part is true: Four ill-prepared and reckless climbers got kidnapped. The rest of the story is based on their version. Another version puts it this way: They got kidnapped, the kidnappers were not prepared to babysit four climbers and did not have enough food or water for everyone. They got no support from local villagers so they let the climbers go. End of Story.The climbers say they pushed a kidnapper to his death and then ran the equivalent of a marathon across mountainous terrain with no food or water, after having had no food or water for days.... not likely. In Kyrgyztsan at the time, most ex-pats had the same opinion of these four: ""Stupid rich kids in over their heads who greatly exaggerated their story."" That's it. Not all that special really."
3,Not very frightening,"How the character's get together in the book is a rather old cliche from perhaps the 50's, 60's or 70's but the premise was wonderful and the writing is well done, IMO. However I believe the writer gives too much away from the beginning."
5,One of the best cookbooks ever!,"A friend of mine got this for me for Christmas a few years ago, and I love it! In fact I've used it so much mine is completely falling apart. Every recipe I have tried is fantastic. My friend had it as well and went through before giving it to me and wrote comments on her favorite recipes which I thought was such a neat idea. You will not be disappointed with this cookbook! In fact I may have to make something from it for dinner tonight..."
5,Buy this book!,I bought this copy because I wore out the original from 20 years ago. I heartily recommend this as a no-fuss resource. Start with the Caesar salad dressing.
5,Good value for the money,"Imagine all the time the author of this book spent collecting and organizing all those puzzles.Now think of the tiny amount of work time that it would take you to earn the price you pay for this book.This book is well worth the price, in my opinion."
4,Extensive Tactical Exercises,"A really good book to sharpen one's game tactics. It has a very extensive set of short problems with answers in the back. I only wish that the format was a tad different. For instance, have one page with the problems and the answers on the back of the same page."
3,"Polgar's 5000 + problems, a little of a problem","Well, there's the good news, and the bad news. If you want to sharpen your eye for checkmates, this book is hard to beat. True, many of the problems are from composed problems, but I find these help with your working out the ones that are found on the board.The bad news, is that this concentrates almost only on checkmates. there are a few endgame problems to work and learn, but little else. If one wants to learn other types of combinations, something like Livshit'z ""Test your Chess IQ"" would be better."
5,A good chess puzzle book,"This book has a large collection of chess puzzles. A lot of them are not realistic. But even a small portion of them are good, that's quite a large number. It's worth every penny."
3,huge mating problems,"Indeed this book is very thick, but it only deals with mating attacks, which isn't good to my opinion.personally, I prefer other more assorted books."
2,For beginners,I think this book is more suitable to beginners up to Class C players. The book is indeed huge in size and contains many problems. The level of the problems is however limited to Mate in three........just not good enough.
5,Intense review for those that play regularly.,"I am a little over 300 problems in and just starting the Mate in 2's, but I have learned more from this book, because of the difficult positions that it shows.Just training the mind to see two or even three moves ahead can be a daunting task. Developing the aptitude to see that far is what Polgar intended. There were times where I wanted to discard the book, and proclaim it too difficult, but after some really hard work, you will begin to see the problems for what they are: A challenge."
2,Kindle edition,I would discourage the purchase of the Kindle edition of this book. The example questions and related chart(s) are separated by several pages. It is difficult to page back and forth between them.
2,Not for the absolute beginner,"I purchasd the book based on the other reviews, but it hasn't lived up to them so far.I would not say this is a book for the complete novice as it introduces concepts without then explaining them, so the reader needs prior knowledge in order to understand them.Also I'm only on page 11 and have found a contradiction in the text which the beginner would find confusing.In paragraph one the book says a torch wll be fully lit if the potentiometer is set for it's lowest resistance, but then in paragraph 3 contradicts this by saying that when the potentiometer is at it's maximum reistance the torch will be fully lit.It is only because I have a vague knowledge of what a resistor is that I could work out that paragraph 1 was correct and paragraph 3 incorrect.This doesn't fill me with confidence about the remaining content of the book.So for these reasons I would not recommend this book."
4,Decent book on electricity,electricity DeMYSTIiFied is a decent basic book explaining electricity. very simple explanations with tests after each chapter. it serves my purpose to clear up some basic principles of electricity.
2,Album functionality doesn't work properly,"The product was pretty good for correcting pictures. However, the Album feature did not work properly. I tried it on two different computers to make sure that it wasn't a conflict of some sort. On one computer, the Album feature did not work at all. On the other the slide show function did not work. I had a feeling that I should have gone with an Adobe product to begin with, I was correct."
2,"An essay, in book form","I've enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's work, so I expected more from her. I THOUGHT I'd find some real humor. This little book is boring. A 300-word article would have been more than enough. It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point. These ""books"" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or ""collect"" yourself, just to have a ""set,"" thinking they might be ""worth something"" or ""meaningful"" someday. I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn. A cursory read, 10 minutes tops, is about all you'll need-- it continues as it begins, so no need to read more than a few pages. I doubt I'd follow-up with the other 6 sins if they lack the depth and wit of this one."
3,Not Much Meat,"I read this book on the heels of Gluttony in the same series, and so was looking forward a serious treatment of the subject. The self-help book parody was amusing, but it went on a little long. I don't feel I know much more about sloth than I did before I read this book."
1,Using satire as an excuse to not actually write a book,"Having read, re read and completely enjoyed Joseph Epstein's ""envy"", I was looking forward to another book from the series. Get that and skip this.I downloaded the sample to my kindle first- the introduction was a witty description of the self-help industry and the treadmill of self improvement. What I failed to understand was that was not merely an introduction to the topic, that was the book. I kept turning the pages waiting for an actual sociological discussion of sloth and was utterly dissapointed. This was a similar experience to the discomfort and annoyance one feels when a Saturday night live sketch goes on way too long, completely killing any initial humor by beating the dead no longer funny horse.Waste of money. I suppose the intent may have been to repulse me with the product of laziness, to show what sloth truly is. It worked."
1,Embarassing both for the author and the readers.,"I hope someone responsible for accepting Ms. Wasserstein manuscript for publication had more good sense or maybe courage to spell the facts to the author: it's horribly unfunny and mildly disgusting.It begs for the laughs so pathetically, it wants to be liked so desperately one is tempted to go on, not to insult the lady by quitting after the first 10-12 pages. After all the book is tiny, you can read it in a couple hours.But I could not finish it. Some books are just not to be published, but if they ARE published everyone can see it was a bad mistake."
1,disappointing,"I read this work after I read Gluttony which was sharp and acute. This work by Wasserstein by contrast is sort of like the subject she chose 'sloth', that is to say sloppy and without effort. This work is not funny, has tired joke themes from some of her other work, sags, is inert, not sparkling. Contrast with Hunter Thompson, a sharp eyed and sharp minded satirist. Or with Mencken. I'm sorry this work is disappointing; her Heidi Chronicles, even though it is now a sort of aged romantic comedy about a very narrow class of women in America, was fresh to the East Coast audience in its time."
1,I say BOO :(,"I agree that this is a beautifully illustrated book, but my son (4 yo) has been having nightmares and is afraid to go to bed since reading this book because he is afraid of what is under his bed, in his closet, under the stairs. he is having very vivid dreams and our usually easy bed time routine has turned into a lengthy ordeal!! OY i wish we had never gotten this book!!!"
4,three seperate shows are on here.,"This features three seperate discovery dinosaur shows, two of them are from clash of the dinosaurs. One is one from the 90's or early 00's about t-rex. so i can understand why some people are unhappy with this dvd. However if you do not own 'clash of the dinosaurs' then this is a good set to get. If you do you may want to skip this one. The earlier t-rex episode features much more primitive effects because they were not as cheap or easy to do back then. the other two are from last year so they look much more effective. Still there's alot of good information in these shows and the picture quality is very good. you don't have to be a kid to enjoy learning about dinosaurs and these shows deliver in that regard."
3,My son seems to enjoy it,This was bought for my son who is really into dinosaurs. He doesn't seem to like the movie as much as other movies he has.
3,Does not support all features on Vista,"Is a great tool for xp. great features such as digital equalizer, but these features are not supported in Vista. Basically this is an XP accessory."
4,External sound card,"This is my second external sound card over several years, which speaks of its durability. My current card is a few years old and works very well. The operating and editing software is excellent."
5,A great USB external sound system,My internal sound system was crackling and hissing even after a new board was installed. If I had known about this external system I would have gotten it and saved some money. The sound is fantastic and I have a much better volume control with the manual settings on the unit itself plus the regular controls on the monitor. It has other features that I don't use so I can't comment on those.
4,Good external card,"I needed SPDIF out for my laptop, which I hook up to my home theater to watch videos. This was one of the more convenient and cheaper solutions available, and I can't say I'm disappointed. Normal stereo PCM out is perfect, but I bought this card for Dolby 5.1 out via SPDIF so I will elaborate on that. On Windows XP Professional, I occasionally (about once a minute maybe) get small silent gaps in 5.1 audio which is somewhat annoying. On Windows Vista Home Premium, I don't encounter this problem. This is all using the latest drivers and Windows updates. Not really sure why this happens as conventional wisdom would say things would work better in XP. Pleased with this product, but wish it would work perfectly in XP too."
5,Great for laptops,"I originally bought this for the ports to connect my home theater sound system to my laptop.Years later, it still is serving the purpose of being my primary sound device.Everyone knows that on-board audio is less than desirable as far as quality goes. The Creative SoundBlaster has set a worldwide standard with PC audio, and of course, this product delivers.It's no Audigy or X-Fi, but to give a laptop that special touch to sound quality, especially if you have this hooked up to a surround system, it's pretty good at $30."
4,Oweson Sound,"Overall I am very pleased with the product. The sound is awesome! Definitely a high-quality product. Install went perfectly under Windows XP Home.24-bit sound is an immense step up from my old 16-bit card. Crystal clear at very demanding levels, quitest passages, and everything in betwen.If you want awesome sound at an owesome price, buy this. Know in advance the equalizer is SEVEN bands wide, not the TEN promised on the box."
3,Nowhere near CD quality sound,"I had high hopes for this external sound card to play music off my Vista OS computer on my new AV system using the digital coax cable connection on the card. Although the sound was much better than my computer's sound card, it still can not stand up to the sound of my CD player playing the same tunes. The music on my computer was ripped at very high bit rates, so these files are supposed to be CD quality. I am sending the Soundblaster card back to Amazon tomorrow and just going to use my CD player for playing my music. Unfortunately I still have not found a way to get real CD quality music from a computer."
2,Not so good...,"Only plays at low bit rates, so the integrated audio on the motherboard sounds better. You will get higher volume than your regular notebook sound."
1,Hard to rate,"The single star is only because there is no N/A option. I purchased this item to transfer vinyl to CD to use for teaching. After much frustration even with ""help"" from the dealer, I have given up and just ordered a TEAC GF 650. Reading all the positive reviews encourages me, however, not to resell SB at the moment and keep it in case the TEAC isn't satisfactory."
3,A nice Notebook-Laptop 5.1 solution 3.5/5.0,"Its one of the few USB solutions for 5.1 in the notebook-laptop and does all the good work but it has som cons 2 it.Its a usb 1.1 and not 2.0 so its slow if you run multiple programs on the PC while listening to 5.1 audio and video and then the sound's not continous, its good if u listen to 2.1 audio though.AND drivers are not available for MAC OS , so MB and MBP owners stay away from this product till drivers are available.The sound quality is very good but not top notch and should work fine with basic 5.1 speakers.Remember when watchin 5.1 movies jus don do anything else...Njoy !!"
1,"801 locust ave apt 403 fairmont,wv",I have purchased a sound card from Creative Type by Amazon did not come the disk and cable I could not use it and i send messages to the seller did not return it and now I'm uncomfortable
2,noise problem,"It can create 'crackling and popping' noise when used with some nVidia boards. That is a known problem extensively discussed on Creative website, but I didn't know until I bought this.."
2,It below my expectation,"I purchased this product to use it with my 5.1 speakers system. Though it detects all the speakers, the output is not satisfactory. As I'm an Electronic Engineer, I can clearly say that it filters out even some of the frequencies which are required. And moreover the output power is much below my expectation. If you are just bothered to get the sound on all the speakers, then this is a good choice, cos there are no competitors for this product. But if you want the real experience, go for a sound card which connects to your motherboard directly. Laptop owners, you have no choice!!"
4,Almost there!,"I've been using the Creative Labs USB Soundblaster Live! 24-Bit External Sound Card to digitize tracks from some of my vinyl albums (Socrpions Live, REO SPeedwagon, Fleetwood Mac...so far). Once I figured out that the software didn't load properly and re-loaded, it has worked very well. The only thing that the software does not have that would be helpful is a useable digital VU meter to set recording levels properly. Right now, I have to guess by looking at the tiny display provided. Once the tracks are digitized, I use the ""Creative Wave Studio"" to clean up the recordings and see if I guessed right on the levels. Most of the time, I was close, but I have had to re-record several tracks to get the volume levels correct. Other than that, it has definitely been worth the money! Rock on!"
2,"If you want to record voice, this unit is not for you!","This unit has unacceptable background hiss when recording from a headset microphone. I compared it with my PC's internal sound hardware (Realtek AC97) and I got much WORSE sound with the SB card. I was expecting much higher fidelity, but the SNR was horrible on the SB. Tech support said there was probably a hardware malfunction, so I exchanged the unit for another one. Same problem. With my 'built-in' sound card, I could clearly hear my wife working in the kitchen downstairs. With the SB card, no combination of recrod levels (on the GUI and on the mic level dial on the box) would enable me to hear those sounds - there was too much background hiss."
2,"Nice cleanup, with a catch","I bought this to clean up the hiss that comes out of my laptop when I connect it to my Yamaha 5.1 reciever. It worked great to remove the hiss and improve the clarity of pretty much every level of sound, but suddenly there are ""clicks"" in my music that weren't there before, and aren't there when I go back to using my headphone output like I had been.Creative offers a variety of sound options accross the board, but the only way they will let you remove those mysterious new clicks and ticks is to install CreativeLabs Media Center-player-whatever.I like my Windows Media Player 11 just fine. Feels like Creative is trying to twist my arm."
5,Best cost effective option to set a Home-theater.,"Sound card works well. clear and crisp sound. I use it with my (also creative) 5.1 speaker system, It should come with the remote, I think, but anyway it is a great value for your money."
1,very poor sound,"Sound was much poorer than the ad let on. The sound was thin and slurred the ""s'ss""....If you are using a cheap set of computer speakers where everything sound like ringing a bell in a tin can, then you may like it. If you use a good $1000 sound system, don't waste your money. Also the seller was rude, unprofessional, and I give a poor rating to also."
3,Good,"Good product. Awesome for getting surround sound on your laptop, especially if you're on the road giving presentations or having movie parties. Perfect to couple with a projector. However, the slow USB connection is a hindrance for DJing which is what I got the product for. it doesn't allow you to use the AISO features that the sound card is capable of. Just like some relationships... the product is awesome but has communication issues."
5,Excellent Notebook Solution,"This unit rocks big time. I hooked it up to my Logitech Z-5500 and my LCD TV in my Living room and let me tell you. IT TURNED MY LAPTOP INTO A $2000 entertainment center. The sound became crystal clear. However, you need to do some customizing. By the way, the new drivers rock. You don't need to disable your internal card anymore. By this if you are into music or watching HD movies with 5.1. This will handle any sound you throw at it. Buy it and you won't regret it."
1,24 BIT SOUND BLASTER SHOWS INSTALLED AND OPERATING,CREATIVE LABS 24 BIT EXTERNAL SOUND BLASTER INSTALLED PERFECT-WINDOWS XP SOUND SETUP SHOWS THE CARD OPERATING BUT HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY SOUND OUT OF IT-THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE PURCHSED AND BOTH DID NOT WORK-I CAN SET THE SPEAKERS VOLUMN AND ALL THE OTHER SETTINGS WORK PERFECT-WHERE IS THE SOUND-JW
2,I am not happy with this external soundcard,"I have a Dell notebook with PIII 866. This soundcard slows way down my computer when I use it to listen music. I guess it is okay when you listening music only. If you are planning to surf on the web or other things, you need a fast CPU to handle this soundcard. I did not know souncard take much of CPU usage. Also software is much different than internal Live 5.1 or Audugy.Itdoes not allow custom setting for sound effect. I love that future on internal soundcard for singing. Internal soundscard allows you to adjust reberv, echo, etc..... I am bit disappointed with this soundcard. Quality of sound through headphone, I did not noticed much different than dell equipped onboard soundcard."
1,Sub-Standard Driver,"I am not a novice at PC hardware but this one was a challenge to install and configure. I have not had enough time to explorer the hardware but the driver installation was riddled with problems. For me, it will always stop at DirectX update. I ended up wasting more time than its worth."
3,Creative SBLive 24 Bit External,So how the hell do I get hold of the remote before i buy this thing?? or can i buy it separatedly if i want
5,Great product,Quality ladder. Used this to replace my existing single step fold down ladder. Makes it 10x easier to get out of the water with the added two steps.
3,great addition,Replaced my OEM 2 step with this 2 step unit.The wife and kids loved it this season.Wished the bolt holes were identical to my old ladder..but oh well.She's in for good :)
4,Dark and Bloody Ground,"I happen to have been born and raised just a few miles from the late Dr. Acker's home and this is a very good account of the tragedy that took place just before my birth. It also gives some nice insight into eastern kentucky's problems both past and present. It is a relatively accurate source, as older people who lived through the depression really did keep their money in their homes (not just here but everywhere). All in all a good read."
4,A Dark And Bloody Ground,Fast service. Book as described. Book has details that are local to me so I found it interesting.
5,Best book I've ever read,"I know Benny Hodge personally and know that he is innocent. He is a wonderful Christian now, and did not commit murder. He admits he did wrong, but he did not kill anyone!!! God be with him."
4,Married In Haste Is Truly Romantic,"Cathy Maxwell has produced a wonderfully well written story. I stayed up half the night to finish reading this book.Tess Hamlin, is the reigning debutante in London society. She is an heiress who has been elluding marriage. She evens wagers some of the other debutantes to see who can get the first proposal of marriage. Her scheme leads to her ruin and forces her brother, Neil, to marry her off quickly. Tess refuses until she discovers that Neil has lost her fortune.Brenn Owen, the Earl of Merton, is looking for a rich wife. He needs money badly to restore his estate to its former glory.The two conceal their reasons for marriage from each other. Tess falls in love with her new husband and is incredibly happy until he discovers she is not an heiress.Tess who is stranded in the middle of Wales decides to make the best of her new circumstances while ignoring her husband. Brenn and Tess lead each other on a merry chase as they find true love."
4,You'll not be sorry to read it,"If you like historical romance, you will like or maybe love this story. Yes there are a few issues with the story that are unbelievable, but I loved the characters."
3,Historical Romance,I really wanted to like this more. At times the story was fun and sexy and then there were times when I was just annoyed. The female lead was loyal to the wrong person (her brother). I didn't understand why she didn't tell the truth a lot sooner. Needless to say I was torn with story that's why I gave 3 stars.
4,Married In Haste (Maxwell),"This is a full length, stand alone, fast paced, often funny, little sexy, historical romance.Brenn has a title, a crumbling estate, and no money. He needs a rich wife to restore his property. Tess is a beautiful heiress with many suitors, but she values her freedom. Her idiot brother and his most nasty wife, however, have squandered her fortune, and now she must marry.While Brenn and Tess are attracted to each other and think they have found a solution to their financial problems, neither of them realize that they're both broke!I really enjoyed this story (I love it when virgins speculate about man parts!), but I wish that there were consequences to the actions of idiot brother and most nasty wife. I guess I'll leave their fate to the ever-dreaded Ton.This is the 1st book in a series of 3, and I'm looking forward to reading about Leah and Anne."
4,An ok holder,"This product is [retty good, but don't even try putting a bood on it, the holder will tip over and it doesn't clip the pages of a book very well. But for papers it's good and it's adjustable, which is convient. It did hold my notebook very well, but for books it sucks."
1,NOT FOR TEXTBOOKS,"I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks. If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page. I wouldn't even use this for a notebook."
4,Perfect for a Kindle,"I was looking for a narrow bookstand to prop my Kindle up next to my monitor on my desk, the reviews cautioning about this stand not being the best for some bigger books made it sound Just Right for the Kindle, and it does indeed do the job nicely."
1,"not for books, disappointed","Despite the name, this is clearly not designed for ANY books (thick or thin), and I have found it not very useful for copy either as the top clip does not grip at all. Its very light and compact, but does not lock into place, no base weight or rubber base to prevent constant slipping and collapsing."
1,Falls apart even with nothing in it,"There were all these bad reviews about this thing not being able to hold a book. Fine, I thought. I don't need it to hold a book. I only need it to hold a piece of paper. It won't. It won't even stay put. Both the front and the back pieces slide down no matter what position you put them in, whether you have anything in it or not. I can't believe amazon even sells this junk."
4,Great Product,"This stand works great, it holds quite a bit of paper, and is terrific for transcription work."
2,Not for thick books,"Despite being called a Book & Copy Holder, this item does not work for books much more than 1/2-inch thick, and the clip come off fairly readily when trying to set up a book. What does work well for books is FEL10024 - Wire Study Stand, which is less expensive to boot."
3,Does the job..with careful use,"Document holder is good. The material is acceptable to holding documents/paperwork and even some books. If you are considering on getting this document holder for large textbooks i wouldnt recommend it, but it can work out on smaller textbooks -- it all depends if the actual holder on the bottom will comply with you text and if clip can extend large enough to grasp the book into place (I say about 2.5 inch will work out nicely)Now the flaw that really holds this back for the busy person i am is the actual sturdiness when moving this unit around. The holder comes apart from the back and you have to re-adjust everytime..which may sound like no problem and think i'm lazy but it really gets annoying if you are going to frequently use this. IF you want a solid unit..i wouldnt recommend it, But if you want a unit just do hold up papers and some novels i would if you have patience."
2,You get what you pay for,"The phrase you get what you pay for is very appropriate when it comes to this product. While it holds papers okay. It frequently falls apart and is flimsy. It does not hold books well, the clip on top does little to nothing to hold things in place, and it only has one true place in which to keep it set in place as the other setting have no secure slot to prevent to small slates from sliding out. I would recommend spending extra to get a decent one if you really use it a lot."
1,weak,"To light for texts books, when one turns the page the book holder topples-over. Also, the base is not wide enough. Does hold book open, top clip is not biggest enough or strong enough to be effective. Don't buy!"
4,insight adjustable book holder,I really like this product. It is adjustable to the book/papers I have and it is adjustable to the position you want the book/papers in. The only thing I didn't like was that the back adjustment does not lock so when I pick up the book the wrong way it comes loose and i have to readjust it. But that is no reason to not buy it it is fully dependable and sturdy. I don't regret the purchase.
1,Kensington's Insight Adjustable Book & Copy Holder,This product sucks...This is not meant for books...I wish I could get my money back..
2,Not a book holder Ok for papers,"I agree this product doesn't work for books. It's difficult to move the pages due to the bottom lip, the clip is insufficient and both snag pages when turning, its to light, and it's not wide enough for most books. It's reasonable for papers. I miss a line guide. Its best feature is that its adjustable in height and angle. Its okay but there are better products out there but you will probably pay a bit more for them. This was my first holder. I have moved on to others but on occasion still use this one if my space is limited and the work is light."
1,Getting what I paid for,"As I only use this product for loose papers, it functions perfectly for my needs. I have not needed it to prop up books, so I cannot comment on its abilities in that area.This copy holder does not move well. My desk is small and I move quickly from project to project. It would be helpful if I could shift the copy holder without having to worry that it is going to collapse. Since the stand does not click into hold the copy holder upright, if I am not careful and try to move it - or heaven forbid, bump it - it collapses.The end of the world? Oh, no. And it does what I need it to do - hold papers for transcription. I do wish I had spent a little more money for a better quality product."
2,Limited usefulness,This book and document holder has limited usefulness for both. The height adjustment does not stay up on its own very well and it cannot hold a document over 6 inches in height unless extended. Magazines and periodicals of any thickness will not do very well since it will not support their weight. Since the top clip is only good for something up to 1/2 inch thick and the bottom does not retain well it has limited usefulness for books of any thickness or binding stiffness. The stand does not snap into place so any disturbance will likely cause it to collapse. Pass on this one. I wish I had.
1,Very poor construction,"I was so hoping I would like this. I liked that you could raise the top part so I could raise the papers up to eye level - but the angle adjustment is horrible, It DOESN'T LOCK INTO PLACE!!!!!! Once you set it up at the angle you want.....if you touch it - it will collapse!!! Talk about frustrating. That is the most ridiculous design ever. Why doesn't it lock into place? Don't you usually flip through papers you might have on a stand or flip through pages in a book on a stand? The slightest touch makes it collapse. Needless to say I returned it and bought the Fellowes Booklift Copyholder #21100...........much better and it folds flat when you're not using it. DO NOT BUY this Insight Book & Copy Holder unless you like things collapsing on you! Total waste of time & money!!"
2,"Adaptable and adjustable, but not sturdy","I purchased this for an elderly relative with movement limited to one hand/arm. I made her a binder full of page protectors holding pictures and cards from loved ones. I chose this item because I could adjust it down for her bible and up for her binder. The good thing is that it is easy to turn the pages. The problem lies in the adjustable angle in the back. It does not snap or lock into place. My relative has a shaky arm and often must make several attempts to reach the page to turn it. Unfortunately, she winds up knocking it over more often that turning the page."
2,Not a sturdy product,"This is not a sturdy product. It's made of very lightweight plastic and the design isn't particularly good. It's easy to collapse it accidentally. I have used it for paper but I wouldn't try to use it for a book. Mine arrived minus the clip at the top because the packaging was poor. On the plus side, the footprint is small -- doesn't take up a lot of room on the desk. But for me the minuses outweigh the pluses, particularly the problem of accidental collapse. There are better choices out there."
2,Dissapointing!!,"Not happy with this at all, its too flimsy and not very sturdy to hold books it falls down easily.:("
1,"Not for heavy books, breaks easily!!",I used this item for 2 days while having it support a medium weight textbook that was approximately 3 inches thick. The product broke on the second day. A big waste of money!
2,very lightweight holder/stand,"Well, it's not the worst book stand/holder I ever had, but way too lightweight for hardback books. I constantly find the stand falling off to one side or the other as I turn from one section of my Bible to the other. It is just too light in weight to use with books. Want the best one: get a Jasmine wooden book stand. A little spendy, but hands down the best out there. God bless. Mike"
2,This thing kinda sucks,I just started using it. I try to turn a page and the thing falls over. It doesn't even keep my book open and the clip isn't flexible enough to clip the book open and this book is less than 300 pages long. I feel ripped off - this should be like $2.
3,"Good for papers, bad for books","As a graduate student who regularly transcribes information from both documents and from books, I am reasonably satisfied with this product. Pros: sturdy once set up, adjustable height. Cons: collapses easily when removing documents from the clip, does not hold books open. Consider this product useful for light/moderate use, but look elsewhere for moderate/heavy use."
2,Audio book only not sufficient.,"The marketing for this product is deceptive. It makes it look like you are getting a CD - book combination, but that is not so. That being said, the price for just the CD set is very high, as the materials are really not sufficient for standalone use. The speakers on the CD speak relatively quickly for beginners, and the CD doesn't offer enough repetition for it to sink in. As a learning method, I don't think it is very functional. It is useful for hearing pronunciation, but the teaching method is inferior to that of say, Pimsleur or the like. I even found the 'Easy Khmer Rhythms' audio book ($6 on audible), to be more useful as an absolute intro tool. They do more repetition and definition of the words so it is easier to learn the terms and familiarize with pronunciation. Overall, I would not recommend using this CD set in isolation. If you purchase the additional book too, (doubling the price) it might be a more useful series, but I have not done that."
2,Not quite what we needed,"My husband and I purchased these tapes as we are moving to Camodia soon and wanted an overview of the language, which we need to learn.Unfortunately, we found the tapes to be quite useless without a workbook or anything to follow along with. The instruction seemed more advanced than the very basic knowledge we wanted -- other than the section where the instructor taught us numbers -- so we now will be using another form of instruction in order to learn simple Khmer."
4,You need this if you have/buy the book,"This is very important if you have or buy the book. This will help with listening skills and pronouncing, which are very important."
2,book should come with CD otherwise it ain't a complete course!,"I think in some ways the CD could be good, but the fact that it is NOT! Sold with the book, but is advertised as a complete course?????All so, a lot the the dialogue is too long to start with. It should build up, not begin with long sentences. There must be better out there."
2,You will not learn Khmer with this,"How do we learn things, repetition, repetition, repetition, say the word in cambodian then in english, then learn to use the words in a sentence. The narratives in Cambodian are useless because there is no translation into english."
1,Poor Product,This is NOT a product with which you will be successful. The sentences presented on the tapes are not spoken slowly or in sections. There is no presentation of singular words for repetitive practice. A complete waste of my money.
4,a very useful course,"I think the course could do with a bit more focus on grammatical detail, in particular the use of verbs - a final 'dtou' comes as a frequent puzzling surprise, and in conjunction with verbs like 'jea' you end up really needing a dictionary. Having said that, this enjoyable course could hardly have prepared me better for my trip to Cambodia. They said I spoke clearly, and were pleased. For further study I can really recommend Judith Jacob's book, and also her dictionary. Huffman's English-Khmer dictionary seems to me to be by far the best."
2,NO BOOK>,Read the promotional text very carefully. This is not a COMPLETE language course. It is only tape cassettes but not the Cambodian language book that is available somewhere if you can find it.
4,Fun toy,Jakks Pacific Toymac Dreamworks Tv Game is lots of fun for my child. we play it together some times. She really enjoys it and I find it difficult to find toys that my daughter does not loose interest in after a short period of time but this one does the trick.
1,This is a generic!,"BeachMart tries to pass this off as a name-brand product. This is NOT the well-regarded ""Windbrella"" made by Solartek. This is a cheaply made generic replica of the Windbrella. For example, the included bag doesn't even fit the folded umbrella.Save you money and buy the real deal for the same price (make sure your umbrella says ""Windbrella""). The Solartek Windbrella is justly rated as one of the best by Good Housekeeping. Buy it; not this!"
5,Like the Finest Bottle of Burgundy.,"It is hard for me to find the perfect adjective to describe this collection. Timeless, intimate, subtle, exceptional. Slightly melancholy but never maudlin, it grows more complex with each passing year. No better example of late 60's ""electric folk"" is available. Perfect on a coming of winter morning."
2,My first and last ZIPPO. Garbage,I filled it up with proper amount of fluid.The flint doesn't roll.It's made out of fake metal not chrome.Never buying Zippo garbage again.
3,"Kensington Standard Desktop Keyboard Drawer, inclu...","The product proved to work very well for my needs. The unit is very sturdy and the drawer rolls in an out very smoothly. When typing, there is no bouncing as in some other similar units. The only thing I have to complain on the product is that it did not come with the mouse pad rest and wrist rests. Where these two missing items are I have no clue and cannot reach the seller to find out, not bad enough to return but still not happy that something I paid for is missing."
5,Kensington Keyboard Drawer,"The product proved to work very well for my application. The unit is very sturdy and the drawer rolls in an out very smoothly. When typing, there is no bouncing as in some other similar units. In my office, I use this product on top of my desk to take advantace of the two systems that I use, MAC and PC. I have a pull out keyboard tray for the other."
4,Needs updating,"This is so basic, how can it need updating? Well it was designed for older key boards and the newer ones are deeper and have music, picture and sound keys at the top which are covered when the tray is fully extended. Otherwise it is exactly what I needed."
3,great but big,"this is an awesome bag, great when it comes to functions, pockets, purpose and very useful bag at your work. Nothing i can say except that the size is too big to carry on ur shoulders or for women to use. Function and purpose wise, it's very useful but the size is just too big to carry on ur shoulders. Maybe, okey for a man but it's got to be big for women to carry it."
4,You Have Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself,"This DVD gives you a rare opportunity to see some of the greatest horror films actors perform in one sitting - 70 minutes running time. Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Bela Lugosi, John Carradine, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney Jr., Peter Cushing, Barbara Steele, Christopher Lee - really a great compilation of over 35 films. Great fun!"
2,"Some General Truths, but a Cookie Cutter Approach","I had to read this book for a seminary class and found that the book has very little to do with Biblical leadership. In this book, leadership is not about humble service, but being the guy up front. I really believe that this book will discourage those that want to serve the church because it will convince them that they have to be CEO material to lead the church.This book is all about the author's system and contains very little scripture. There is plenty of scripture on leadership which this book completely overlooks."
5,Leaders are Made--not always born,The Making of leader...there are stags of leadership that everyone goes through from beginning to senior years. It is a refreshing book that helps understand those transitions and how to do it gracefully.
3,Weird and quirky,"Odd little book about superstitions and rituals, for example the Tuscan ""Battle of the Bridge"" in which teams tug-of-war with trolleys over a bridge. Also, bizarre proverbs from around the world and how unbroken lines of chalk can be used to protect oneself from ghosts."
4,"Who are these guys, anyway?","I first heard of this band on a college radio station and felt compelled to dash off and buy the cd. I haven't a clue who Vitapup is, but the raw audacity and amateur avant garde quality of these tracks draw me in seven years after first purchasing it. I've always thought to research Vitapup, maybe I still will, but I highly recommend checking out this release. Think: Sonic Youth meets the Descendants. The track entitled Firefly really incites some deranged giddiness within me. The only downfall is the goofy spoken exchange, I think it's track 5. Avoid that one, and you will still respect me in the morning."
2,Not good on tile,We bought this because my wife was traveling and I thought it would be a good safety measure. It arrived quick and is loud enough but it will slide on tile - defeating the purpose entirely. We ended up buying on of those that butts up against the door handle and goes down to the ground. It worked for our purposes.
3,just not that useful in our home,"We bought 5 and returned 4 b/c only one of our doors really works well with this alarm.That being said, the alarm is ear-splitting which, in this case, is a good thing!"
1,do not buy this guy,"Poorly designed and simply does not work. No alarm at all. Makes no noise. Arrived dead. Silent. Non functional, non operative.I returned it immediately--and did not even get credit for that."
1,Not much right with this alarm.,"I bought this for my back door to scare intruders when I wasn't home or to wake me in the middle of the night.The alarm only chirps when the ramp is pressed and shuts off immediately when the door is closed again. It would take a burglar seconds to figure out that this was not a real alarm. With a door between me and the alarm in the middle of the night, I can barely hear it. If you are right next to it, it's loudish, but not bad. On the other end of the house, it's quieter than a kitchen timer. And finally, within two weeks of getting it, the ramp started sticking and hanging up. It's hit or miss if the thing goes off at all now.I wish I had bought something better."
1,Worthless on carpet,"I bought this alarm of use on my bedroom door to the patio so I can open the door at night for air. If you have carpet and the door is exterior like mine it will not work!! Exterior doors have a rubber bottom door seal that prevents you from putting the tip of the alarm under the door without setting it off. Because of the carpet, all the alarm does is slide backwards over carpet when the door is opened. I even tried velcro on the bottom of the alarm to no avail. Just be warned!!"
3,Too light to always work properly,"It's loud, fairly sensitive and easy to operate. Trouble is on wood floors the unit isn't heavy enough so the door often pushes the alarm out of the way without setting it off."
3,good for travel,"Works just like described. Only negative, I bought for travel. To remove the battery, you must have a screwdriver. Kind of a pain when you are traveling."
2,Does it work - yes. Do I like it - No,It is very unusual for this to actually work on a hotel door. The distance between the floor and the door has to be just right. I recommend you look for something different if you want a little extra travel protection. I bought this because I am a single woman who travels to foreign countries twice a year. I no longer pack it with me. I have not found the right combination of floor to door ration to make it useful.
3,Should be louder and stay activated,Awesome price but disappointed the alarm can't really be heard outside the house. Doubt a neighbor would hear it unless they were outside in their yard. And most disappointing of all is the fact that the alarm stops as soon as you quit pushing on the door... so unless a robber passes out immediately and keeps pressing against the alarm it could nothing more than a quick chirp (sounds like a smoke alarm on steriods). But great alert at night to hopefully at least wake you if activated by an intruder.
3,"Works perfectly on carpet, not on hardwood.","Seems to work exactly as advertised on carpet. On hardwood, the door simply slides the doorstop backwards without pressing the alarm down far enough. It does have a ""non-slip"" rubber bottom, but it didn't seem to be non-slip for me. But even a doormat keeps it in place. But if you don't have carpet or a doormat and your floors are smooth, it might be a risk."
2,door gap to floor too wide doesn't work for me,read the reviews about the door and floor gap too wide but had to purchase it to try. basically won't work on any of my doors. might be good for using in hotels as per others say.
1,not the best purchase I ever made,Not the best purchase I ever made! My home was broken into so I bought these to alert my neighbors. They sound really loud in the house but cant hear it outside. Dissappointed!
3,Well...,"I am not sure why I ordered this. It is not very practical. But, you know what, I am still convinced I will find a good use for them..."
5,Simple and Effective,I use one of these on a door that enters into my garage from the outside. Normally there would be no way for me to hear if someone was trying to break-in from that door but this little thing is so loud I can easily hear it from anywhere in my house. I also use glass-break detectors on some of my ground floor windows ever since I had some guys smash trough a double pane window in the back of my house trying to get in. I have a gun in the house so I use my alarms just to give me enough time to get my gun and call 911. I don't worry about people breaking in and stealing stuff when me and my family are not home all that can be replaced.
3,"Works, but showed up with a stripped screw","Item showed up brand-new in the package. Opened it and the screw that holds the battery cover on (on the bottom of the door stop) fell out. The screw was stripped, so I had to tape the battery cover door on, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the friction pad.The alarm is extremely loud and the price is right, but I'm really a bit skeptical at build quality that allows something so fundamentally integral to the device to fail upon delivery.PS - I did not attempt to exchange or return this item. For the price, it's not worth my time or money to ship it back."
4,LOUD,"Use ear protection to test this door stopper alarm. It is ear splitting. It is not designed to stop anyone...just let you know the door has been pushed, even slightly."
2,Not so good,"These are a cool idea. However, there are 2 flaws in the design. One, the ramp device does not meet the floor flush. There is basically a gap. My front door is very close to the floor so it would hit this unit too low and wouldn't press the ramp down (which is what initiates the alarm). Also, the device has rubber on the bottom to hold it in place via friction but it isn't grippy enough for my hardwoods so after the doors makes contact with the ramp too low, the unit just gets pushed back out of the way for a total fail. I think it would work great if you had a door with sufficient clearance so that it hits the unit high enough to depress the ramp AND if you have carpet so that the rubber can grip better. I have neither so this did not work for me."
2,didn't fit our back door,this thing didn't fit our standard back door of the house. seems cheap material also. may try to use it on some other door in our house but could have been designed better to work on any door.
5,"My """"Ghetto alarm system""",The title of this review came from my friends. This was their first reaction when i showed it to them in the office. It is low budget but it does what the description says it does. I bought this to put in the backdoor of my house. My husband is away on business and I hate being all alone. It is very loud and I have no doubt I'll hear it upstairs in my room. It is not an 'alarm system' so it can't call the cops for you if someone tries to break in but it will likely scare off anyone trying to break in.
2,door stop alarm i choose this cause it would let me know f anny one trying to get in the house in the night that thing can not,"i chose this because it would let me know if anyone was try ing to get in the house in the night first the thing can not fit under the front or back door so i will have to use it in the i guess, i would not tell nobody to buy this but it could make noise if you could get it under the door it would work."
1,Didn't work,"The grip on the bottom of this didn't grip on my tile floor at all - when the door opened -- the alarm just slid out of the way. I tried it on carpet, and linoleum and the same thing happened. It just slides away. The alarm did work when I pushed the two pieces together. It is loud -- just don't know how you would keep it in place when the door opens so it can do its job."
5,Additional Security,"I chose this product because I needed additional assurance about one of the doors in my home. This unit is discrete and super easy to use. If the door does open onto the door stop, the alarm is ear-piercing. It's definitely loud enough for a wake-up, and I believe it would even trigger my glass-break alarms. Inexpensive and good investment."
2,"alarm does not work, $9.00 door stop","Bought this for use in hotels.tried 3 different new batteries and the alarm does not work. It's an effective door stop and for the price not worth returning. But be aware, you can get an old style door wedge at the big discount houses for a couple of bucks."
5,Secure feeling when you live alone,"I purchased a Door Stop Alarm for each of my outside doors. They truly give you asecure feeling as any movement of the door sounds a really loud alarm. They do nothave to be wedged under the door, just sit firmly against the door. Would recommendthem to anyone, especially someone who lives alone. These were ordered fromAmazon"
3,NOT GOOD FOR OUTSIDE DOORS,I wasn't thinking when I bought this one. It seemed like a good system but it won't fit under any of my outside doors unless they're open. We have weather stripping on every outside door and it won't fit under door.
4,Well..,"It does what it says and really nothing more. Very simple, though it doesn't work very well when place on carpet."
2,Door space below must be high,Wasn't able to use the 4-5 units I bought. My doors at home doesn't have much space below for this device to fit.The sound is loud though and the product finish is nice. Too bad I can't use it.
1,Sucks,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I had bought an InterDesign squeegee at Target a couple of years ago and loved it's clean and sleek design. I wanted to replace it but they no longer carried it. I thought this one on Amazon was the same, but the quality clearly isn't. It is cheaply made and the junction where the blade meets with the plastic looks like it was glued by a first grader. Also, the suction cup is part of the squeegee handle, something I didn't notice when I bought it. So instead of being able to put the squeegee on a suction cup with a hook, you have to pull the suction cup off of the wall every time you use it. Horrible design and quality. What a waste of $$!"
2,Only buy if you are handy with tools,"I would have given this product 5 stars if I had not needed to correct some manufacturing defects. First, I used an electric drill in order to make the swivel holes a hair larger because the swivel arm would not swivel easily. Next, the line guide does not slide up and down because the plastic clips are holding it much too firmly. You will need to shave part of the clips away with your drill using a small drill bit. Finally, one plastic ""clip-on"" piece and one plastic ""press-in"" piece, at opposite ends of the swivel arm, require gluing before attaching, a fact not specified or addressed by the manufacturer. I used Gorilla Glue which worked very well. Now I love it, but are you ready, willing and able to do the modification?"
4,Guderian Was One Of The Brightest In WW II,Guderian was the tactician and strategist that made tank warfare the fast moving battle gaining ground faster than the infantry and supplies could support. He also was the only General that disagreed with Hitler on a one for one basis and kept his commission. He knew WW II was lost when Hitler invaded Russia.
5,The Tighty Whiteys' Prayer,"Jockey is my shepherd; I shall not want.Their briefs maketh me to walk comfortably in green pastures: They leadeth me snugly beside the still waters.They sheltereth my nether regions; they leadeth me in the paths of luxurious cotton for my genitals' sake.Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of boxers, I will fear no chafing; for Jockey brand briefs art with me."
2,Jockey Briefs,"I ordered ""classic"" jockey breif, which I currently own, but the new units received are approximately 2"" taller on each side when compared to my current briefs, both labeled Jockey Classic.???"
5,xmas gift,"it's good stuff. the price on amazon was a deal!!!it's good product, consider giving it to any man in your life, great last piece gifts and it's practical. they will think of you each time they put them on."
5,Full Rise brief - Heather pack description,"I've been a Jockey wearer for a long time, but I went to pick up a new set at the mall and they were out of stock. Online purchasing was great, but I wasn't sure what a ""Heather Pack"" meant. I took a risk, but I was right: a ""heather pack"" is a pack in 3 colors: navy blue, gray, and black. Exactly what I wanted."
4,The Witch Next Door,"The book that I read was The Which Next Door. This book is about a witch that moved into a new neighborhood, everyone thought that she was interesting. She paints her house black,and has magical powers. I think the appropiate age level for this book is between 5 and 7. I think that the book is really good, children should like it if they are really creative and have a good imagination."
3,a good start...,"if you are trying to stem the tide of public opinion about witches (to your child). Although I don't particularily like the depiction of the witch having a black house and sleeping upside-down like a bat, Bridwell DOES depict her as a good person and that counts for something. You may have to discuss with your child what spells are really all about, however."
5,A fantastic book!,"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and I still have my very battered original copy. A wonderful story of acceptance."
1,Makes a great Music CD,The video and the audio are distracting to the point that I won't watch it. The Songs and the tightness of the band are phenomenal. A CD I belive was already available. great to listen to but not what I bought it for.I agree. It is a flawed product. They need to fix this.
1,horrible,"What were they thinking when they made this? This DVD is very unwatchable. It contains some awful effects on every song. The feel of this being an actual concert video is completely lost due to these effects and the blank space between each song. Because of the effects, you have to squint to see the band members, and when you see them, they look bored. They look like they don't even want to be there because they might be able to forsee the outcome of the video they're recording. Hopefully they'll never screw up future concert DVDs like this. Avoid this one at all costs! If you want a recent show on DVD, get House Of Yes instead."
1,Don't wate your money!!,"Is there any danger in just showing us the show ""LIVE"" ?? If you are a YES fan, you'd buy it, not because you haven't heard the music before, but because you want to see them perform LIVE..this is doctored (so badly) that you'd want to kick you're TV screen in!!"
2,Music Good... Video Bad.,"The sound quality and overall performance are unparalleled, that is why I (generously) give this DVD two stars, however...I got the impression that half the film shot during the show was somehow lost and they tried to make up for it with interspersed video clips that are nothing short of ridiculous.Furthermore,The step-motion videography is extremely annoying,If Steve Howe is performing a solo, don't show me Chris, or a flag, or water, or the ceiling, or anything else,It is obvious (and distracting) that the audio and video are out of sync through most of the show, however, in some cases, its apparent that the audio and video are combined from two completely different performances. This is just plain insulting.I dropped [money] on this and will likely never watch it again. I am a big yes fan going back to the mid-seventies but this is a big disapointment.I would rather watch a third generation VHS tape of YesShows than sit through this one again"
