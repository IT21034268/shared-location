2,doesn't clean the carpet at all!!,"Very heavy, cleaner lever doesn't activate easily & doesn't clean the carpet at all!! Haven't tried it on the kitchen floor yet but carpet results don't leave me optimistic for the hard surface either"
5,Super Rug Cleaner,"I had borrowed one of these from a friend and fell in love with it. It is simple to use, does a GREAT job at cleaning every type of rug from semi shag to low pile area rugs and even hard floors! I have 5 dogs and use it often. The hand attachments are great for the car or indoor furniture and does a really good job on those hard to clean spots like sofa arms. For a clean freak like me I couldn't ask for an easier to use machine. Almost as easy as just pulling out the vaccuum cleaner to do a rug. Just plug, fill and go! Also really easy to clean after use. Just rinse with hot water and store."
4,Hoover carpet cleaner,"I have used this product, and was very pleased with the job it did. I was influenced to purchase it by the reviews on-line. It performed well, I was amazed how much of the dirty water it sucked up. The carpet was practically dry when I finished, and didn't take any time at all to dry completely. I would recommend this item."
1,Broken...The first use,"It worked great...for half of my bedroom...Then It quit vacuming the cleaning solution from the carpet...Nice...dirty, wet, carpet. It's a piece of garbage. I have to take it to the repair center because I didn't want to pay another $25.00 to return it. If someone tries to sell you one of these, run for your life."
2,Getting Suction,[[ASIN:B00009R66F Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge] Cleans carpets well once suction is established. Getting started usually requires a dozen false starts with a half-hour of fiddling with the receiver tank and cover to assure no air leakage.
4,Like it but still trying to figure out the tools,"Overall I am satisfied with this purchase. Assembly took about 1/2 an hour or so. I have only used it twice so far but I am happy. However, I think I need to have another sit down with the instructions because I have not figured out the tools yet and I have really been wanting to do the upholstery. Oh well, my main reason for getting this was for the carpet."
2,nice cleaner upholstery tool JUNK,"Started out seemed kinda cheap made but fairly easy to assemble. After i got it together and shampooed carpet. lOVEd IT until i used the upholstery tool, the carpet cleaner works great but the upholstery tool is broken.I messed around with it for 3 hours and it leaks all over the floor with a refurb do you check it out or just resale it.not happy but i am not going through the hassle of shipping it back."
4,Worked as great as it's reviews,"Cleans great. The hand tool worked great on my stairs. The water holding space and cleaning path width are a bit disappointing, but not enough to spoil my happiness."
3,Works great when it's not falling apart,"This machine truly works great when it stays together. However I have had pieces fall off of it literally from day one. Most importantly the main rotary brush falls out every time I use it. Without it in and in place, the machine will not work. I ""snap"" it in, but it keeps falling out if I lift the fron of the cleaner off the floor. Other minor pieces parts have fallen off or refuse to stay on. Having said that, it does an ourstanding job of cleaning when it stays together. This is the downside of buying from Amazon - if I had bought it locally I would have returned/exchanged it."
4,Hoover SteamVac,"Nice machine. Easy to assemble / operate. I would have liked for the clear hood and nozzle in front, where the dirt is sucked up, to be removable for easy cleaning instead of the company's procedure of putting clean water on a hard surface and going over it.Nevertheless, I'm happy with the F5914-900."
4,Steam Vac Vs Bissel,"I've now owned both the Bissel and now the SteamVac. The SteamVac is clearly the best of the two. It's also the best bang for the buck since it costs less than the Bissel. It was easy to use and performed above expectations. The only drawback was the upholstery cleaner. The hand tool used for upholstery could use a redesign due to the awkwardness of the distance from the cleaner output spray nozzle to the pickup. Still, if your using this primarily for carpets it's a great buy and you wont be disappointed."
3,Would LOVE it if it weren't broken!,Cleans great. I love this cleaner. I owned one several years ago. Loved it SO much! I lost it in a move so I decided to buy another one. This one seemed fine when I first got it but once I started using it realized it must have been broken inside. Leaked allover the place especially when I used the hand tool. If it would have been handled and/or shipped more carefully it would have been perfect.
4,A great product,"I've had this machine for a month now and have been very pleased with its performance. The water tanks are easy to remove and fill, the suction is terrific and the spinning brushes do a great job of lifting out embedded dirt. Also, the machine is easy to maneuver...and that makes a big difference if you get all excited about it and want to clean your whole house like me. :)I have used this machine in all areas of my home...traffic areas, living areas and bedrooms, and it has done a wonderful job of getting out the dirt. It's great to see the dirty water go down the sink...but kind of embarrassing too.Overall, I believe this is a product that does what it says it does. For the price and free shipping, I don't think you'll find a better carpet cleaner."
4,Bought it after Christmas,"I thought it did a good job. I don't know how easy or difficult it was to put together, because my husband did it. They were prompt in delivering it."
3,Putting together,This machine was easy to assemble until the hose part came . My husband & I decided to wait for another day to figure this one out. Not a bad price for5 the job tho!
2,"Made in China, Piece of Plastic . . .","Hoover used to be an American company that made durable equipment for it's buyers.What a shame and sham.A shame-sham, if you will."
1,STeam vac Review,I set up the carpet cleaner and attempted to use it- but it leaked everywhere. So as of right now it is at the vacuum repair shop awaiting parts so I can use it.
3,"works fine, but used item","The order arrived and appeard to have been used. Residual dirt in tank and broken plastic tab. Didnt realize until all assembled. Decided to keep as it works fine and too much trouble to dissassemble and re-pack, Amazon gave an additional discount for the problems. However next time I will inspect thoroghly before assembling and would return if not new!Item works as described and does a great job. A bit cheap construction, but for the money you really cant complain. Carpet is dry in about 3 hours if you take your time and do a thorough job. Amazon was fair about the used item, but still a bit peaved anyway... Not enough to stop using Amazon (unless AZ sales tax comes into play!!). Would be 4 stars if received new."
4,Good machine,"Machine is new. Have only done one whole house of carpet. My wife and I were both very pleased with the performance of the machine. The proof will be in the longevity of the unit. I did some online research, and this seemed to be one of the most reliable machines on the market, and a great value. time will tell, but so far we are very happy with it."
5,Must Have for All Households,"Years of calling carpet cleaning services for a house that has pets and children,we finally decided to purchase a cleaner to do it ourself. The results are amazing and have exceeded our expectations. Do yourself a favor and buy one today."
2,Breaks easily!,"The first carpet cleaner I purchased several years ago was a bissel. It was not an upright, but it did a great job, but it started leaking after about 3 years of using twice annually. My husband purchased an upright hoover in about the year 2001. It worked well, but started leaking shortly after we purchased it. I don't know why, but I purchased another one to replace a couple of years ago and it began leaking after the second or third use. I am still looking for a brand which will not leak, and last longer than these."
4,Good product for the money.,I just recently steamvac-ed my living room and am pleased with the results. I have a dog and was pleased to see how much dirt and hair got picked up in the filter even after thoroughly vacuuming before using the steamvac. Why rent a steamvac when you can buy one for a comparable price?
4,good machine,The machine is light weight and easy to move around. The return basin has safety features that keep the machine from operating if all the parts are not JUST so. This is good but very frustrating. Have to read the manual to figure out what is wrong.It cleans very well and I like the straight edges that allow it to get next to the baseboards and around furniture. Much easier to use than my previous Hoover.I would buy this again.
1,ORDERED NEW - GOT RECONDITIONED...WHAT A JIP,I ORDERED A NEW HOOVER STEAM VAC AND THAT IS WHAT I PAID FOR. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A RECONDITIONED USED STEAM VAC NOT EVEN PACK IN THE BOX CORRECTLY AND MISSING PARTS....NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY TO SEND BACK. I WILL NOT BE SO QUICK TO ORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN. ONCE BURNED---TWICE SHY.
4,"No steam, just clean","I've only used it once so far, but it certainly pulled out the dirt. (I was surprised to see how dirty the water was.) Putting it together was fairly simple. (No leaks.) Only ""problem"" was that I found it a little hard to manuver due to it's weight (lots of water). I also thought it took longer to dry then I had imagined it would (probably just my inexperience with using it.) All in all I am pleased with the results and that's what counts."
1,Don't buy this steam vac,"This flimsy built ""steam"" vac is in the repair shop after I received it. Broken brush assembly, broken handle (won't stay in upright position) common problem on the internet. I didn't want the hasssle of returning it for I disposed of the shipping box the day I received it which co-insided of rubbish pick up and I discarded it. It is my understanding that items must be returned in original boxes.Repair shop[ tells me 4 to 6 weeks for repair andHoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900that Amazon or Hoover takes forever to pay for repairs and they are not eager to deal with them. I think this unit was a return that was just shipped out again without fixing whatever reason it was returned."
3,"Good Enough, Not Great",I am a little disappointed in this carpet cleaner. It cleans well enough but has a very small tank. I don't have a huge living room and it takes more than one tank. That means dragging it back to the kitchen to fill and dump in the middle of cleaning.
2,"Owned less than 2 years, used 4 times and it's dead.","Worked great the first 3 times I used it. Started to use it tonight, turned it off to refill, plugged it back in and now it won't suck. All suction is GONE. Went through all of the troubleshooting to no avail. I bought it in July 2010 and not even 2 years later, it's dead and out of warranty."
1,only one time used,"I purchased it at 10/2010 and only used one time after received. Then it was storaged.Today I took it out ,it dead."
2,Leaked on 2nd use,"Worked great the first time. However the 2nd time I pulled it out, the clean water tank leaked all over the floor. Th problem is not the valve in the clean water tank as it does not leak until it is put into the cleaner. I will take to a service center for repair."
5,Love this!,"I had a Bissel which never really got the job done. After it broke, I borrowed my friends Hoover, which worked great, so I had to get my own. Delivery was fast, and the product is great, they only thing I would change is to put on a longer power cord. My carpets are now way cleaner than with the Bissel!!"
4,improvement over past model,"I was pleased to see this replacement for my 6yr old steamvac is just as good at cleaning carpets, and it also has some needed improvements. Much easier to clean the recovery tank, lighter weight, and more slack/flexibility in the attachment water hose (which had been brittle and had broke in my old steamvac)."
3,"I loved it, until the clean surge broke!","This is the best carpet cleaner ive ever used, the most effective. I even learned to live with the rather mundane task of refilling and emptying the containers because it really made a big difference in my carpets. However, after maybe a year of every other month use-the clean surge brushes stopped spinning. I noticed one day they werent working, but went ahead and finished my cleaning..well, the next day-there were stripes all over my living room floor where the solution was sprayed into the carpet, but because the brushes didnt rotate-it didnt clean properly! I have since lent it to my sisterinlaw who also had the same experience. The only useful part of the cleaner is the hand tool now-which stinks because this truly is the best cleaner out there. Ive owned the bissell steam clean-and this blew it away!"
4,Great machine for wall to wall,This works great for wall to wall -- we used it in our office and it is easy and does a great job! However do not try this on your orientals -- take them to the pros!
4,Brushes r the key,"We had an old model Hoover...(no brushes) that was OK...This one made us feel like we could stand to live with our current carpet a bit longer. Have yet to try the attachments so will see how the smaller stuff comes out. A bit noisy, but worth it!"
2,Weak parts,Steam Vac was nice for about three uses then the brushes stopped working. I took apart the turbine assembly and discovered that the turbine blade itself doesn't have any bearings and had rubbed a grove in the top of the turbine assembly housing causing the turbine blade itself to crack in half. This is a part that spins very fast and is in use whenever you use the spin brushes it should have at least some form of bearing to keep it from failing. Funny thing is the gears in the turbine have bearings just not the fan at the top. Now I am forced to spend another $40 to replace a poorly made part.Other than this the Steam Vac worked great and made my heavily worn carpets look much better. The hand held attachment worked great for cleaning the upholstery in my car.
5,It really works,"Skeptical, but Tired of renting carpet cleaners and tired of hiring people with that special deal that always ends up costing more after the ""needed"" add on services. This little Hoover steamvac cleaned my carpets way better than the last company I hired, and it was easy to use. The water was black with dirt. Just for fun I went back over the carpet a second time and the water was almost clear. Stains were gone, the carpet smelled good. With three cats and two dogs thats quite an accomplishment. More like a miracle.I used the Hoover deep cleaning solution and was totally pleased. I don't think you can go wrong with this carpet cleaner.I highly recommend it."
4,Good Deal,"Was worried at first since the box arrived crumpled on top with an obvious repair job on the outside and when I opened it, cleaning solution had leaked all over the cardboard inside.Went ahead and assembled it hoping it hadn't been broken in some way. Read the directions carefully as advised in the other reviews for the product. And it works great!Perfect for the owner of a very old dog. I was tired of lugging the rental carpet machines in and out of the car and house. However, I didn't have much money to spend. This machine cleans very well and is easy to use once you get the knack of it. If you do the extra ""dry"" stokes, the carpet dries very quickly. Only complaint would be that the dirty water tank does fill up fairly fast.Definitely very happy with it, would buy it again in a heartbeat."
5,Great steamer for the price,"A prior review suggested reading the manual carefully to ensure proper set up and functioning. I did so and followed the cleaning directions. With that, the steamer has worked very well. Have not yet tried the upholstery attachment so not sure how well that works."
5,wow!!!!,This is so worth the purchase. Ever since we bought this we have never had our floors steam cleaned again. It made our carpets look like new. We have a cat and dog and it cleans up any messes and stains that had been on our carpets for years. I love every thing about this Hoover!
3,"Looks cheap, but cleans ok","I had to return the first vacuum Amazon sent me because it was clearly used and defective. I was a bit apprehensive about receiving the second one and was disappointed at first. The vacuum seems cheap and even the second one did not look brand new. My husband insisted that once you return an item, you never receive a brand new one as a replacement, so it is possible we got again a refurbished item. We tried it once, it seemed to clean ok, but it is still hard for me to love this vacuum. I guess for this price you can't expect anything fancy, but even looking at the vacuum it has an old and cheap feeling."
3,"cleans well , but poor design","I chose this product because of the multiple rotating brushes. and I knew that I could put very hot water in it ,so not having a heater in the machine didn't worry me. our tap water is hot enough to get dirt out just fine.BUT when I opened the box and put the unit together, I was very disappointed at how flimsy and poorly designed it was!!!! a 8 year old child could /would snap the spine of this machine .easily. when in an upright position ,it is very fragile feeling , so I use a bungy cord to secure the spine of the machine when not in use.with very little pressure the lower part of the machine in the back , could break away from the up-er portion.when you go to snap the clean water tank back in , it doesn't always snap securely back in place.the surge shot is a nice plus for pet stains.if I had to buy again, I would find a different brand with the brushes, but a better designed frame work.the Amazon delivery time table is great."
5,Customers never wrong,"I spend few hours to search review on a number of deep cleaner brands, and found this one is the one choosen by so many customer as the best one in a very good price.Customers never wrong. Thank you guys, for your reviews."
1,Didn't last/piece of junk,"Initially I was pleased with this cleaner. It did a good job and was easy to use. It quit working one day after the one year warrenty ran out, and I couldn't get any satisfaction from the manufactorer. After repeated emails I just gave up. Will definately not buy this item again, and would recommend that no one else buy it either. There's too many out there to choose from and maybe those companies will back their products better"
3,Beware of limited warranty-Hose break and had to pay for new one,"While this product has done a decent job as a carpet cleaner, the hose lever broke while I was attempting to clean my stairs. I had only used the product twice with no excessive force on the lever. When I called HOOVER to replace the hose, they said it was not covered under the warranty and that I had to pay for the new hose. I was not happy with that since it seemed like a faulty, poorly constructed plastic structure to begin with.All in all, this product does what it is supposed to, but I was not particularly happy with the Hoover warranty and what it covered."
4,slightly improved over old model,"We've had another Hoover Steam Vac in the past. This model is slightly improved, mainly in the apolstery attachment, which we use for spot cleaning. It has an agitator now and has a place to stow it now. Overall a pretty good cleaner for the price."
4,Works Great..... Perfect for any home,"I recently moved into an apartment. The carpets were most likely never cleaned (previous renter's were dog owners). The Hoover steamVac was easy to assemble and use. It is extremely powerful, you can see the dirt being sucked into the recovery tank. Make sure you put the recovery tank lid on correctly or the vac will not work properly and clean the unit after each use. Great carpet cleaner for the price, Can't go wrong. Cleans better than some professional / rental units."
4,Works for me!,The Hoover SteamVac with Clean Surge gets the job done. The Clean Surge trigger dumps a goodly portion of the cleaning mixture onto a spot which the brushes will work on to remove the spot. The only bummer that I can see is the way the hand cleaning hose attaches to the vacuum: it seems to dangle and get in the way all the time. Therefore we usually remove the hose when we are cleaning the floor and then reattach it to store. I think this machine provides good value for the money spent.
5,Great SteamVac,"The Hoover SteamVac is an excellent cleaner. Did all the carpets in my homeand obtain great results equal to and better than some professional cleanersI have used. The steamvac is very easy to use and not heavy unlikethe one I had previously (another brand) and only used about six times beforethe motor burned up.This cleaner is rather quiet - very unlike the previous one. Had researched a number of steamvacs and read many reviews and this Hoover F914-900, in my opinion, was the best rated of all. Absolutely pleased I purchased it."
2,Really Great for a Short While,"This cleaned really well about three times, then the motor stopped working and I had to get it fixed. Luckily it had a one year warranty so other than being a pain to take it 45 minutes away to the Hoover store, I was covered. I've used it 2 x since and now the water won't leave the cleaning tank to travel to the floor. Very frustrating - more landfill electronics."
5,Excellent Cleaner!!!,"I had a base model Hoover steam vac that I purchased 5 years ago and it finally died on me. I had borrowed my neighbor's Bissell to clean my carpets, but it didn't have great suction or dispense a lot of fluid. I decided to stick with Hoover and am not sorry I did so. This model is by far an excellent value for the money and does a fabulous job getting all the dirt out. The water was black when I dumped it. Who knew from the cats, dog and kids that there was that much dirt in my carpets. I now spot clean once a week with my Hoover and couldn't live without it. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone."
4,"Surprised, Yet Pleased","This is the first time I've owned a carpet cleaner. Any experience before always came by hearsay about other products. Before buying, I looked for ratings on the internet. The Hoover rating among the best for the price, so I tried it. It was easy to set up and start cleaning right away. I was surprised at how well my carpet looked after finishing.The only downside was in the cleanup. I guess when dealing with so much dirty water, hoses, and brushes there is no avoiding messes. We also own dogs, so getting all the dog hair cleaned out of the brushes was a little of a challenge. My advice when cleaning, place the cleaner on a smooth surface that can be easily wiped up afterwards.All in all, I'm glad I bought the product."
4,Generally satisfied,"I'm generally happy about the steamVac I've bought, the carpet feels soft on the feet after you clean it. It works good on everywhere except the stairs. You have to switch to the hose and the hose is not long enough so I end up having to carry the whole thing in one hand and do the job with the other hand because the stairs are too narrow for the whole machine to stand still on the step. So if you live in a one floor house, it's very good.Willa"
1,Hood broke after four uses,"While this product performs well when it works, the front hood screw mounts broke after only four uses; rendering the unit without suction. It's obvious the mounts were not designed for even light use. Now I get to see how good their service is."
4,Love It!!,"I find this machine very easy to use, and it cleans very well. I foster cats for a local animal rescue and frequently need to shampoo the carpet and this has been a life saver. The price was great and it was shipped quickly. The powered hand tool was missing, I contacted Amazon, who then told me to contact Hoover, it's been over a month and I haven't received the missing part yet, but I am still happy I bought this product."
4,A SteamVac of Our Own,"We've been borrowing this Vac from friends and neighbors. It seems THIS is the one to get! We had another brand carpet cleaner and it fell apart quickly. (So that's why we've been borrowing this one).Finally, with our aging dog making messes, we decided to get a vac of our own. Didn't realize this wasn't a widepath until we received it, but still works great!The containers are awkward to remove and replace, but I'm sure with time, we'll get used to it. Have yet to use the upholstery tool and see if it cleans as well as the floor. The one we borrowed did not have good suction on the upholstery tool.We like the fact that it comes apart easily to hose out the dog hair and dirt. We can tell the difference between the borrowed machine that hasn't been cleaned out and our new one. We'll see with time!"
5,This carpet cleaner is fantastic!,"I have 3 dogs and unfortunately they like the indoors when its cold or rainy. I have tried all kinds of cleaners from the pet store, which left residue on top of residue. I've also paid carpet cleaning companies and the Hoover cleaner did at least as well if not better. Unless you are cleaning an extremely dirty area, I would recommend using half the amount of cleaning soap solution and when you are done go over the area a second time but using plain water. This will pick up any leftover soap in the carpet. Well worth the money. Not too heavy to lift up stairs. Also did really well on upholstery. A great purchase."
5,AWESOME STEAMCLEANER,"This is an awesome steam cleaner for the money...we have a dog and a 3 1/2 yr old so we needed a powerful but easy to use steamcleaner. It is very easy to use and our carpets look as clean as the day we moved in! The dirty storage tank is pretty large so you don't have to empty it a million times while cleaning. The clean surge works awesome for the spots. I have owned smaller carpet cleaners in the past that didn't work as well, this is hands down worth every penny."
3,"Works Pretty Well, A Pain to Lug Around","After reading good reviews of the recent crop of home carpet cleaning machines, I theorized that I could buy one for the same price as one professional carpet cleaning. This has mainly been true, but this is a heavy machine that is not exactly effortless to use. Overall, it works pretty well - it doesn't work miracles on certain stains, but it will keep the carpets clean. I am skeptical about its rinsing abilities, so I feel the need to clean them again with plain water after using the carpet cleaner. It also doesn't heat the water all that well. A nice item but hard to get motivated to use it, because it's kind of a pain to set up, lug around, and clean up afterwards."
4,"Clean carpets, but leaky with upholstery attachments.","The Hoover F5914-900 is my first steam cleaner. It got my carpets cleaner than the model I rented from Giant, and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years. I did have problems when I tried to use the attachments. Water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected - might be user error. I will have to look for better hook-up instructions."
1,READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"It was just about 6 months old with a low to moderate amount of use when it began to leak water all over the floor. It buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened. Then plastic parts began to break off of it. I brought it to a friend of ours who is a repairman for vacuums and shampooers. He looked at what was broken and said it wasn't worth repairing. It did do a good job of cleaning the carpet. BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment. I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it. Amazon is good about that. Leaking is a serious problem for a machine and all the plastic breaking on critical parts is cheap, un-fixable materials."
2,NOT a Steam Vac,"Definitely false advertising. There is nothing ""steam"" about this machine. If you have pets, don't waste your money. All it did was dilute and spread out the dirt. The ""surge"" feature just squirts more water over an area. You would think if there are steam irons why can't we have a real steam vac? Also, after getting the water as hot as possible it only laste about 10 minutes and then you have to refill the tank."
4,Great vacuum..Does its job very well!!,"We got it during the black friday deals week for a price nobody can beat and within 2 days of ordering it.As always Amazon rocks!!.. As far as the product is concerned, it is a very good steamvac for the price.It does its job very well.. Cleans up even the toughest dirt. The steam works really well and the carpet dries very fast.I wish I could give it a 5 star, but only complaint was that its capacity is less. A full tank of hot water can clean only half (sometimes 1/4) of an average sized room..Performance wise it is a very good product. I have owned it for about a month now and no issues at all!!"
4,Cleans better than Stanley,"I used to leave my carpets to be cleaned once a year by a service (tried several). But now I save the money and use this regularly when needed. It's easy to use, and with 2 dogs, accidents are quickly and cleanly removed. While it doesn't bring the carpet back to NEW (neither did the big services) I feel like my carpets are cleaner more often!"
3,Leaks when using hose -1 star. Made of plastic(careful with hot boiling water) -1 star,"This is one of the best carpet cleaners for the price. That said, it is make of cheap plastic parts and will most likely not last longer than a year when used with boiling water. If not using near boiling water, it does a less than satisfactory job.Pros:-Cleans carpets like a boss-Details Cars like a boss-Cleans stairs like a boss-Dries Carpet with it's incredible suction-Best carpet clean for the priceCons:-Leaks when using the hose-Uses a LOT of electricity-Plastic everything, probably wont last longer than 1 year with avg use with Hot water"
2,"Arrived damaged, customer service won't replace","We received this with a crack through the handle near where the detergent bucket clips on. It works, but obviously we want something new and unbroken. The package includes a note about ""please don't return to the store you purchased it"" which is reasonable since it was just one replaceable part and it still works as it is.What isn't reasonable is Hoover's customer service giving us the runaround about forwarding an Amazon invoice, then sending a PDF, and then just not responding to emails. All I want is a five dollar piece of plastic before the warranty expires. I can only assume that Hoover's strategy is to just hope I give up and accept the broken product they sent to me."
3,"Is my ""new"" Hoover actually used?","Length:: 0:04 MinsI received the Hoover F5914 this weekend. I read a few reviews from people who received used machines. When I unpacked the unit, it seemed to have more scratches than one would expect with a new machine. However, the main reason I think mine might be used is because the measuring cup, and in particular the black ring that surrounds it, are covered in a white powdery substance that MAY be dried detergent. Also, the underside of the lid of the water tank has a bit of a brown, sticky-looking substance. I've included a short clip of the measuring cup. Before I go through the hassle of returning this, can anyone who purchased this machine tell me if their cup had this white substance on it?"
1,Breaks After A Few Uses,"Just rent a machine. These things are so cheap I can't believe it. I read other reviews that said the unit would break after a while and I didn't believe them. I bought one and guess what, it doesn't work now. Short story short: believe me and just rent a unit."
1,POOR CONSTRUCTION,"I just ordered this machine and in assembly, a hole on the machine did not align with a hole on the part to which it was to be secured. The 2 holes are 1/4"" apart. Unable to get any customer service from HOOVER, who did not even include an 800 number. Called long distance, phone rang then just stopped. Will never buy HOOVER again - customer service is non-existent. I'm returning it immediately. I would rate it no star but have to check one star to get this review shown."
1,Hate it!,"This machine has never operated correctly. The first time I used it, the pick-up quit ""picking up,"" so I was left with wet carpet. I didn't use it again for a while, but when I used it the next time, it worked okay, but then, the next time, the pick-up never worked, and I was left with soaking wet carpet that took six days to dry. I hate this machine and want to hammer it to death. Now it is too late for me to return it, and there is nowhere near me to have it repaired. I will never buy another piece of equipment like this on Amazon. I will only buy in a store where I can return it."
3,its just OK,I'VE JUST USED THIS STEAM VAC FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS WEEK. EVEN WITH READING THE MANUAL IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR TO ASSEMBLE ONLY TO FIND IT LEAKING WHEN I USED IT. I HAD TO DISASSAMBLE AND REASSEMBLE IT AGAIN TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM WAS I DIDNT PRESS THE SURGE BUTTON HARD ENOUGH TO HEAR A CLICK WHICH STOPS THE LEAK(IM NOT SURE WHY IT DIDNT COME ALREADY ASSEMBLED? ) I'VE USED THIS ON AN AREA RUG I'VE HAD FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS. IT WAS NEVER PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED BUT I HAD CLEANED IT A LOT WITH CARPET CLEANING SPRAY AND A DAMP CLOTH. I FOUND THE STEAMVAC JUST OK. IT DID GET SOME STAINS OUT AFTER CLEANING IT FOUR TIMES WHICH TOOK CLOSE TO AN HOUR BUT LEFT A YELLOWISH GLOW.I ALSO FOUND THE SUCTION THAT HOLDS THE DIRTY WATER CONTAINER TO BE A LITTLE WEAK EVEN THOUGH THE LID WAS TIGHTLY SECURE. FOR THE AMOUNT OF CLEAN WATER USED THE DIRTY WATER CONTAINER WILL ONLY SUCK ABOUT 1/4 FULL IF LUCKY. ALL IN ALL IT IS JUST OK.
5,Another five star review.,"My brother had one of these, we used it for years with fail.Me and my wife recently purchased our own, and we have used it several times now. Fantastic product!"
4,Good bargain,The assembly of this product is not the easiest I have ever encountered but once I got the hang of the instructions it went together fairly rapidly. We have used it once now and it did a great job of cleaning the carpet and picking up most of the water afterwards making dry time quite short. I recommend this as a good bargain.
5,even better,This is the third Hoover I've owned over the past 15 years. The first one I used for six years until the motor finally quit. The second one I just gave to my sister. This one works just as well as the older models and it seems Hoover finally made the waste water tank bigger since it ran out of clean water before the waste water tank filled. Great product for the price.
5,Fabulous rug shampooer,"I had purchased a lighter weight machine some time ago and wasn't sure my carpets would come clean with this new purchase. However, the Hoover F5914-900 did a superb job on my Berber carpets. You might have to pre-treat ground-in stains, but I love the way this one sucked up all the grime from the rug. I have a dog and a teenager, so it was put to the test and it performed. Some customers complain about the ability to clean it out after you use it, but I found it easy. The main part just lifts out. They even give you a tool for getting into the tight corners to wash it out. I recommend this for high traffic areas and will save you money, if you have the time to do it yourself."
3,Be careful,"First one was defective. When I filled the water/detergent tank, the machine leaked the contents all over the floor.Spoke w Hoover. They kept me waiting on the phone over 10 minutes. Then they were no help at all.Amazon exchanged the defective machine for a new one at no cost (they paid shipping) to me. The new one works well."
4,Works great,This replaced the Hoover all-terrain that broke on me. Even though it has a smaller water tank and doesn't seem as heavy duty and aesthetically pleasing...this steamvac works much better! I noticed that it sucks up the water much better than the all terrain and the other bissell brand that I had in the past. It's also a hundred dollars cheaper than the other models.
4,The Hoover Steam Vac,"I have owned this hoover steam vac for about 4 months, and have used it about 5 times. It has worked well so far. When I first received it, I thought it was kind of cheaply constructed, but it gets the job done adequately. It took a little while to figure out how to use the stair cleaning handheld option, but it worked adequately once I figured it out. Overall, this machine is good for spills and pet mishaps, and it has lightened up my carpets. The water in the collection tank is always incredibly disgusting, so it must be doing something right. The only thing is that the brushes ripped up my carpet a bit. Maybe I should use them on the lower setting next time."
1,PLEASE PLEASE Dont waste your time or money,"I can not explain how bad this product is. It took so long to get the brushes to spin. I Had to go online to find a group discussion on how to get them to spin. When and if you can get that to work, well good for you because the next issue you have is to figure out why there is no suction. The whole water tank will distribute water all over your carpet and never suck it up! So now I have a wet dirty carpet and am running to the local Lowes/Home Depot to rent their carpet cleaner. You should not have to pay ANY amount of money to figure out how to get a product to work properly. It needs to work correctly from the start.If I find a product and like it then I try to be be faithful to that brand. Because I wanted to save a little cash I was swayed to change. Now there is more of an expense to fix this problem. Had a Kenmore cleaner for many years that was really good, same with a Kenmore vacuum. I will NEVER cheat again. Kenmore why did I leave you!!??"
5,worth every penny,This is by far the best carpet cleaner EVER. I live in an apartment where the landlord would not replace the carpet before I moved in. I bought this but before I did I researched the best cleaners. I would definately reccomend this particular Hoover.
4,"Cleaner works very well, company packing is another story.","The carpet cleaner works very well. I was a little worried when I received it and it was not packed well at all. It was like they threw everything in a box and put a very small amount of tape on it and sent it on its way. All the parts were loose and no cushioning at all. That being said, the cleaner seems to be working fine and does a very good job on the carpet, especially for the price."
3,too heavy,"It is a very heavy machine, that is hard to move. It takes a long time to finish little areas. Wouldn't buy it again. The rental ones or the canister ones seem much better and more reasonable considering the price. It cleans fine though."
5,Hoover Steam Vac Carpet Cleaner Does the Job!,"Great purchase! I have two large dogs and my nice wool rugs can get very smelly. I have been sending them out about once a month and finally decided to try this steamer cleaner that had received many good reviews. I am extremely pleased. One of my concerns was that it might wet my rugs too much, as they are on hardwood floors. That did not happen; it works great! What a difference and what a cost savings to be able to do it myself!! On Amazon, this steam vac cost less than one month's cleaning!!"
4,F5914-900 Review,"Well worth the money - paid for itself the first time I used it. Would definitely recommend. However, shop around for best price - I bought ours thru Amazon - infinitely better priced than Best Buy."
3,Steam Cleaner needs more of a vacuum seal,"I have only used once. Have a really hard time getting the recovery tank to seal in order for the vacuum to work. I have to take it all apart, remove the recovery tank, take top off and then put back on, and then put it all back together only to find out it still does not have a good seal. I have had to do this 8 times before I get a good seal. Very frustrating and takes a lot of time. This is either a defective machine or a defective design. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Warranty?,"Do not buy this machine! I used it in my Living Room, worked great, moved onto my bedroom, brushes stopped spinning. I did everything the manual said to do, no results. I called Hoover, they said I need to take it to a Hoover Distributor, which is 61 miles from my home. I asked if I could take it to a local repair shop, they said No. If I did do this they may reimburse but the 2 shops I called, they have gone through this with Hoover, and they have never been paid, so they will not deal with the situation. By the way, I spent almost an hour on the phone with Hoover with no results. I sat on the phone waiting for a live person for 28 min. After reading the reviews, I guess I was the unlucky person to get a lemon."
5,Love it!,It does everything I had hoped! It seems to clean very well and it holds more water than other home cleaners I've used.I don't have any problems with it leaking. A very smart purchase!
4,"I LOVE IT, love it.","Its a great machine i love it, i move to o new home in November 2010, and the carpets where very durty in the house i use my new hoover steamvac machine and it did a amezing job on the carpets my carpets looks like new . Im very please and happy with it i love it, thank you . Nan"
2,Disappointed in this Carpet Cleaner,"This carpet cleaner cleans fairly well, however it does NOT dispense the cleaner as it should. The only way I am able to dispense the cleaner is by using the ""surge"" switch, then it dispenses too much at one time. I would NOT recommend this product."
4,"Really want to love this machine but so far, just in deep like...","I've owned this machine for over a year now used it about 6 times. Once you get the hang of the few quirks that machine does have (like the bucket not lining up precisely resulting no suction or the leak issue) you can clean your carpets without much effort and be very pleased with the results. After reading may of the reviews, I have to say one reason why the dirty water bucket fills up quickly has to do with the amount of suds in the dirty water receptacle. More suds mean the bucket thinks it is full faster, even if it is only 1/2 full.Overall, I'd buy this machine again, simply because it cleans great even if I do have to empty and refill the water frequently when cleaning."
2,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this Hoover Product. During the third use the unit stopped. The motor had burned out. [...]. In conversation with some Hoover authorized repair facilities, I learned that Hoover was sold and pats were in short supply.Let the buyer beware."
5,HAPPY,"Occasionally, a product performs as stated and anticipated.This Hoover product does an excellent cleaning job. Yes, you do have to fill the water, empty the discharge and clean the machine in general.Have just one comment for consideration. If your rooms have a lot of furniture and close quarters, you might want to consider this model rather than the wider, and more deluxe unit. It will only be more difficult to use in close quarters. However, the wider units will cover more area quicker if not obstructed."
5,wonderful,this was so easy to put together i was cleaning my rugs in under an hour. as for the cleaning solution i use lil tide n sometimes i use a lil downey the stuff works wonders n it cheap. since i do this @ least once a week (i have alot of dogs n cats n kids etc daily life lol) but i noticed a cange in my rugs look after the first wash (n my rugs r over 20+ years old) this thing is awesome
4,good,The machine works as advertised but it's a little heavy and the attachments are difficult to install in the machine.
1,Cheap plastic,Received mine today. Immediately noticed it was a return but had not been used. Decided to assemble anyway. I was ready to send it back right away when I saw how the plastic was so thin and looked as if it would snap in just a few uses. Continued on until saw how the hose attachment would need to be hooked up. Very likely that panel would snap with first attachment. Stopped and packed the machine up for a return. I did not run the machine so I cannot attest to its performance. Definitely too cheap for me to risk. I will spend a few more dollars for a more sturdy machine.
1,mom of 4,"I bought this becaus I have 4 kids and needed an easy reliable cleaning tool. Well, as a Hoover fan, I was sorely dissappointed in this product. From the first time I used it I thought it would be great. The next 4 times over a 2 year period I couldn't get it to work. I followed all instructions and suction, or other problems always persisted. It is not user friendly and I would never recommend this product to anyone. I finally just smashed it to bits out of frustration and threw it in the garbage. Good riddence."
1,no suction,I tried it out for about 20 minutes and then went to empty the dirty water and the container was dry. Reviews suggested wiggling the door on the suction tank. I did and got some suction but it seemed pretty mickey mouse. I am returning it after less than a day's use.
2,Mediocre,"Don't be fooled by the deceptive name of this product - it neither produces nor uses ""steam."" In essence, its a glorified wet-dry vacuum.Here's how it works: you push the ""trigger"" hand control which sprays the usual diluted rug shampoo/water mixture onto the carpet underneath the machine. The only ""cleaning"" is provided by a fixed straight (plastic) brush on the bottom of the unit. There is no rotary action or powered brush at all - YOU provide the only mechanical cleaning action by pushing the unit back and forth over the carpet. The ""wet vacuum"" feature then sucks up the excess liquid and whatever dirt you've managed to loosen.Will it remove loose dirt and soil? Yes. Will it ""deep clean""? No. Will it ""steam clean""? No. Does it effectively remove stains? Definitely not.The construction is cheap molded plastic held together with a few screws and brackets. There are better products available in the same price range."
1,"Obviously used. But sold as ""NEW""",Took it out of the box and it has some obvious usage to it. Scrapes and scratches all over the exterior. Which I wouldnt mind if it was sold as a used item. Which it obviously is. Plus the price is way too high for it to be used. I will contact Amazon and update my review.
1,Don't buy this,"I don't know how this thing got so many good reviews, but it's a piece of crap. 2 days after buying it, 1 of the brushes broke off of the end and the spinning brushes no longer spun. The thing doesn't heat water up so you have to put boiling water in it every time. Then it just sort of gets things wet and doesn't really suck anything up. Also, it is really complicated to assemble and figure out how to use. We just decided to return it and either call a steam cleaning company or rent a steam cleaner next time. Also, it leaked all over the floor. I ended up listening to my husband curse at the machine for 2 days, lol."
1,"no steam ,",steam vac??? theres no steam. this is a misrepresentation. no belt . great!! vacuum operated brushes have no real scrubbing power. this cleaner really sucks!! no wait!! i mean it's a piece of junk. monkey man
3,Not a Steam Vacuum - Hoover said it's a trademark only,"We did not see the steam, only a dribble of cleaner. Hoover CSR said Steam is a trademark only. It puts down the cleaning solution via gravity and then vacuums it. It is a manual process controlling the cleaning solution put down. It does work. On a scale of 1-10 my wife said its a 4. It takes the easy spots out, not so much for most, or ground in dirt."
5,"Does a great job ,really leaves the carpet dry if you go over it several times",I have used a premium model of this machine and I find this one does a better job of cleaning but you can't switch between cleaning and just rinsce. Often times to eliminate the build up of detergent residue I just use water with out any detergent and you can't switch back and forth as is an option on the deluxe model. The. Recovery tank is much easier to dump out and clean.
2,faulty product,The product was sent me with an accessory part missing and the container that held the solution leaked. I sent it back for a refund.
3,Pretty good quality.,"It really cleans quite well. But, one thing i would change, is where it sucks up water in the front. There is really no way to clean that. You can suck up clean water, and it cleans it somewhat, but I wish there was some way to take it apart, and there is not. Also, using the furniture cleaners, is such a hassle, I am not going to use that brush. Too much junk to hang on the cleaner, just too difficult to use.But, for carpet cleaning it really cleans well. With a new puppy, its a must. I will see how it holds up, so far so good.That is why i rated it a 3, for the carpet cleaner , alone, i would rate it a 4."
1,Junk,This is a piece of junk. We got this from the store and it came in a new box and wrapping. But the item uses cheap pieces of plastic (think disposable plasticware) and the appearance seems as if it was already used.
1,leaks like crazy!!!!,"I have had a Hoover steam vac for years with no problems. When it gave out I replaced it with a similar steam vac, the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with clean surge F5914-900. I have used it once and it cleaned very well, the problem was when I stored it away. I have always been able to leave the clean unused solution in the tank and the tank on my steamvac but when I did this with the SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with clean surge F5914-900 it ran down thru and out the bottom of the cleaner and all over by floor and there it sat for 24 hours before I found it. When I called the company all they could say was not to store the water on it but to take the tank and store it separately. WHAT A CROCK....if you are going to make a product that you want good reviews on trying making a GOOD PRODUCT. Seems to me the Hoover no longer cares about standards and has joined the long line of CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCTS!"
1,Not good,"Seems to have enough suction but there are a few major drawbacks. First of all the receiving tank is way to small. Have to constantly empty it as the fresh tank is larger. The power cord is too short. It leaks badly. Finally, leaves dark areas after cleaning. Piece of junk. I like Hoover products but this is unacceptable."
5,Good machine,"Works as described perfect for our carpets.we have light beige carpets in 4 bedrooms,this machine was easy to operate,easy to empty the dirty tank and made the carpets look new."
5,"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900","Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900.Did my research before pulling the trigger. High rating in leading consumer magazine was on the mark.This carpet cleaner works and works well! Relatively easy to use and cleans well. Bang for the buck is very high."
5,Awesome SteamVac,"This is the greatest steam cleaner I've ever owned. It has extremely powerful scrubbers and great suction. The upholstery attachments are wonderful. Usually attachments like these don't really get the job done; these however cleaned the couch that our beagle likes to lay on with no problem. Make sure you empty the waste container often, otherwise it gets a little heavy and difficult to push around. Everyone should have one of these steam vacs!"
4,best I have used,"We used our new Hoover F5914-900 for the first time last night and I have to tell you it is far and away a better cleaner than the Dirt Devil we previously owned. It virtually picks up 90% of the water, allowing the carpet to dry in a very short time. We had shampooed the carpet only about a month ago so I wasn't really expecting to get much out of it, but it actually had mud in the bottom of the pick up tank, it is very powerful. So far the only thing we don't like is the hose and handheld attachment placement, it is really in the way so we simply took it off. I would recommend this cleaner, does a good job and a good price too."
5,The Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner does an outstanding job!,The Hoover SteamVac Carpet Clean with Clean Surge is wonderful. It did an outstanding job of cleaning all our carpets. It got the stains out with minimal effort. It is easy to use and easy to store. We are 100% satisfied!!
4,Works great,"After unpacking, setting up, and learning how to use this cleaner, using it is a breeze. One minor problem with the design is that the top water container has to be removed before bottom can be emptied, which means that dirty water has to sit forthe next time I use it. Or do I have it wrong?"
3,"Having owned both, the Bissell beats this one!","I owned this model for quite a few years and it does work pretty well. The B side - it was really heavy to move around, the waste tank is badly designed and there is no way to gracefully empty it without spilling it; there is no heat feature; it is really hard to clean (impossible to reach some spots, in fact.)I recently bought the Bissell ProHeat 25A3 as a replacement to this and I am really happy I did. It is lighter to move, has a longer AC cord, has a much easier and cleanere fill and empty tank process (though the tank is smaller) and heats the water. It also has a small and easier to use tool handle.They are about the same price - I would go for the Bissell, unless you feel lazy and just want the giant tank for water."
3,pretty good.,"A little upset that the vacume dose NOT HEAT THE WATER, you just add allready hot water, which cools fast. however the rest of the vaccume seems to work well."
5,Works Like A Charm!,"Instructions for assembly get a C+... Not very clear, but enough to figure it out. The machine itself works better than I excepted (for the price). Some deep or older stains you have to work with - but that's going to be with any carpet cleaner. Overall, I'm very pleased and would purchase again."
1,brushes won't spin after a few uses,"The brushes won't spin after a few uses, I've cleaned the screen and tried troubleshooting as recommended online to no avail. It's useless now. The cleaning was subpar when it did work 'properly'"
5,Best I've used,"While others have complained about this SteamVac leaking, mine doesn't leak at all. You do have to use it correctly, but lf you do, you should have no leaking problem. In the past I've rented units from Lowes. I enjoy using this Hoover much better. True the tanks are a little smaller, but it's also easier to use and does every bit as good a job. I would recommend this unit for a great, inexpensive SteamVac."
2,Doesn't pull the water back out of the carpet!,"This is the second time I have used this machine. The first time it worked fine, but this time it will not vacuum the water back out of the carpet. I have messed and messed with it, and my husband thought he had it fixed by getting the dirty-water tank properly seated. Even then, it didn't take anywhere near close to all the water out that it had sprayed in. But now I am doing a second part of the carpte, and once again, it will not remove the water, AT ALL!. I have had two Bissels (NEVER buy that machine, either!). I thought I had a much better steamvac in the Hoover. I have company coming tomorrow and don't know what I am going to do with my wet carpet. The local vacuum repair guy refuses to repair steamvacs. What a hassle!"
4,Great HOME unit...not a professional machine,"I bought the Hoover F5914-900 after reading all the great reviews. My overall opinion is that this is a very nice home unit....emphasis on home. It's not meant to replace a commercial cleaning service. It pulled up most of the stains with ease and is EXCELLENT at removing the excess water from the carpet. I have to say, that is the part that impreses me the most. You WILL have to scrub/blot stubborn stains up with a stain cleaner. This machine won't get those out by itself (none of them will). However you can use the Hoover to remove the excess stain cleaner from the carpet. The cleaning solution that comes with it does not leave any signs of browning on the carpet (at least not on ours). And again this is a really nice cleaning machine...if you don't expect a miracle from a home unit."
4,No suction,"After reading several reviews, I found this carpet cleaner has problems with suction; experienced this problem with much frustration. Tried all suggestions to fix the problem, but no success. I was ready to give this cleaner away, but found a ""fix"" that works.Make sure the rubber gasket along the top of the dirty-water tank is clean. Apply petroleum jelly around the top of the lip of the dirty-water tank, then you should be able to move your finger smoothly along the lip. Place the top on the dirty-water tank, making sure it closes with a snap. This will create a tight seal in the dirty-water tank. The suction with be strong and remove the water/solution from the carpet.After this ""fix"", the cleaner is great. It does a great job cleaning carpets and suctions the solution/water from the carpets leaving them only damp. The carpet dries much quicker than other carpet cleaner brands because of the great suction. Would recommend this carpet cleaner....with the ""fix"" instructions."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this steamer after carefully researching reviews by both Consumers Report and by other people who have purchased it. The one review that repeatedly came up regarding this steamer was: ""the machine's suction stopped..."" Well, I assumed that this was due to the buyer's inability to know how to use the machine as the reason.....NOT! This cleaner's suction stopped working 3 hours after I used it to clean my carpet. The suction just stopped!I'm not sure if this is a common problem or it needs to be in a recall status, however, I will say that when it was working, it did do a good job of cleaning my carpet and getting out embedded dirt. But, if I can only get a one time use out of it, what good is it to me? I'm on my way now to take it back to Home Depot! Will I get another one......the jury is still out on that decision!Do your research and still, don't think that the more you pay for one of these cleaners, the better it works. This one works but not for long!!"
2,Missing Parts,Came to me missing a part; the bottom holder for the power cord. Called the 1 800 number and they sent the part. Worked great for about three weeks then lost all suction. Sent it back to the manufacturer and am still waiting for it's return. The floor upholstery tool has no suction and just gets everything wet and well brushed. I should have went with the other model I was looking at.
4,I have clean carpets,"I like this carpet cleaner. I have dogs that excel and bringing the dirt in from outside, constantly. We have rented before, but it gets really expensive. I read the reviews and followed some of their tips and now I have clean carpets and a way to keep them continually clean."
5,Great Rug Cleaner,"I love Amazons reviews by the way, but my wife has been looking for a rug cleaner for years. We always rented the one at the supermarket, drag it home, drag it back. We looked at all the big appliance places and were ready to lay out 2-3 hundred dollars. Then I went on line and these thing are still not cheap. Then I started reading amazons reviews and from what I gathered the more expensive the unit the more it stunk! The F5914-900 had great reviews and cost half of what the others did. Even all the other hoovers had nothing but Hate mail, but everyone loved this model and you know what? So does my wife. You should vacuum first (we have 2 dogs) hair will clog the brushes a little but for the price it works great and we've had no trouble yet. My wife uses this thing alot (clean freak) and it takes up the same space as a vacuum. The upholstery attachment works great too."
4,Is a bare floor attachment included?,"I bought this model based on the reviews and I had borrowed a similar Hoover from a friend that worked wonderfully! However, in the description it says it has a bare floor attachment which I was looking forward to as I have a lot of laminate floors. There was not one included and Amazon said I had to talk to Hoover and Hoover said I needed to talk to Amazon. I would give 5-stars to the machine because it is so easy to use and leaves my carpets dryer than I thought possible. Minus 1 star for the run-around I got from both companies."
4,Hoover F5914-900,"Works well,deep cleans with minor water residue. Only drawback is that it's somewhat hard to clean when finished."
4,Good Product,After much research I decided on purchasing this machine and glad I made that decision. After completing all the floors in the house I was really impressed with the results. The only thing I would like to see changed is larger fluid capacity. Dumping & filling gets to be tiresome.
3,Loose Handle at base,"Just received our machine today. The handle where it is attached to the base of the carpet cleaner seems to be loose. When the cleaner is in the upright position the entire handle has a lot of play in it and actually tilts back some instead of standing straigh up. I am not talking about the part that we attached with the 2 long screws, but where the manufacturer had their part together. Question- Does anyone know how I can tighten it up? I looked but just can't come up with anything. I'm excited to start using the machine and would hate to send it back. Thanks Mom"
1,dont waste your money,"i assembled the vac fine, on the 2nd use the suction stoped, i am a licensed contractor, so i am handy, trust me this steam vac stinks"
1,Stopped sucking after 2 uses,"Worked fine 2 times, but then stopped sucking the water. It still disperses cleaner, but that doesn't do much good if it leaves the carpet saturated. Tried calling Hoover, but apparently they are too busy to help me. I'll have to return to amazon. Very disappointed."
3,HOOVER STEAM VAC,I WILL TELL YOU LIKE IT IS. 20 FEET CORD. TOO SHORT. THE WATER FILL DOESNT HOLD VERY MUCH WATER. DONT SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER VERY LONG CAUSE THE WATER RUNS OUT QUICK. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO CLEAN YOUR CARPET BUT IT DOES A OK JOB I GUESS. DONT GET VERY FAR UNTIL CORD RUNS OUT. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IR REALLY SNAPPED INTO PLACE OR IT WONT WORK. I THINK THE ENGINEER COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB BUT FOR THE MOST PART ITS OK BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE TIME!!!!1
1,Received returned item,I haven't used the cleaner yet but did assemble it. It was obviously a returned item because the cord wasn't wrapped. The hole where you attach the tool caddy was drilled in the wrong spot so the caddy doesn't fit quite right. I'm sure that's why the previous buyer returned it. I didn't want to go through all the hassle of returning it but will if it doesn't work properly when I use it for the first time.
5,Very good cleaning tool.,Thanks for a great price on a great SteamVac. One of our house bunnies lost his vision and it took a while to regain his litter box skills. No one can tell he ever had an accident after we cleaned the carpet with this tool!
5,Used To Rent Rug Doctor......,"We used to rent the Rug Doctore for our carpets.. $30 for a day of usage and it only got the carpets kind of clean and clean for a week or so, but we thought that the results were just what we would get.We finally decided to buy this machine...Our 1st usage got the carpets cleaner than they had ever been.And they stayed clean!!! Part of the issue with the Rug Doctor was the padding underneath wasnt getting cleaned, just wet and as you walk on the carpet the dirt comes right up again...but this thing.. sucks hard and cleans so well! The drying time is minimal also.Highly recommend this and if you have ever rented the Rug Doctor and think your carpets were clean... try this and you will be amazed!"
4,Cleans well but...,"...when I still have fluid in it and leave it to sit between uses, the cleaner leaks out! I thought my dog was having accidents over and over right by the cleaner until I realized the buckets on the cleaner were empty. It could be something I've done wrong, so I'm going to keep trying."
2,brushes quit spinning by 2nd use,"In January, upon receiving the Hoover SteamVac F5914-900 Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, we cleaned the carpet in our entire house without any problems. However, in April we chose to use it again. Sadly, the brushes would not come on and spin. We referred to the owner's manuals and online suggestions trying to figure out what to do, but to no avail. I must now take the Hoover SteamVac to the repair shop to have it looked at by a repairman. Thank goodness, it has a 1 year warranty, but this is highly inconvenient considering its only our 2nd time to use the machine."
5,If I knew it would be this easy!,"If I knew it would be this easy to clean a carpet, I'd have purchased this machine years ago. It's much easier to maneuver than the rental cleaners I've used through the years and I'm really happy with the results."
4,new to steam cleaning,"Always have had my carpets done professionally. Decided to research cleaners for personal use. They sure have come along way from the days of the bulky and heavy ones you can rent. I figured why not try one..if I can't use it with comfortably, I will return it. To my surprise, this hoover is really easy to use. I'm kinda little so these appliances can be too difficult for me to use, but I'm happy to say I have no problems with it. Not too many steps to get started. Easy to control amount of liquid I want to spray. You can see the dirty water going into 2nd bin. I didn't get to clean my whole rug at the time,I was just experimenting while I had an extra hour. It was fun to use. I really wanted to keep going! Another day...Oh yeah, carpet seemed to dry reasonably fast. All in all I think this is a great product for home use.I want to say I'm really appreciative to Hoover. Their customer service rocks!"
4,strong suction,This cleaner is very easy to use and works well - It is a little heavy to move around but only when full of water (and if the tanks were smaller you'd have to keep refilling - so better to be heavy than have to refill every few mins. and I guess you could fill it half way if it was a big deal). The biggests downside is the brushes underneath. They are round spinners and the are are turned by one of the brushes so I'm waiting for that to break and the rotating brushes to stop working. Best part about the machine is the suction - it has a strong suction and leaves the carpet fairly dry.
4,Does exactly what you need,The basic carpet cleaning funcion is great - the handheld attachment doesn't have nearly enough suction to adequately pull the water/cleaning solution from stairs or upholstery.Only used it once though.
3,Very convenient,"I decided to purchase a carpet cleaner because, if left to my own devices, I would never go to the store to rent one. This device is much lighter than the commercial models you'd rent at the store, and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, the lightweight plastic construction, in my opinion, gives this cleaner a cheap or flimsy feeling. While it may feel fragile, I have yet to experience any issues operating it apart from an improperly seated waste water container, that while easy to fix, briefly impaired my operation of the device. A good selection of attachments are included with the device. My one complaint is that the clear plastic screen in front is screwed on, and to clean it you either need to unscrew it or fish out whatever is in there with a plastic stick they included in the packaging, which is either inconvenient or, quite frankly, a disgusting experience.Not sure why it is called a steamvac, as it clearly lacks any sort of heating element."
4,Pleasantly surprised at how well it cleaned,"I was initially skeptical about carpet cleaners especially after my experience using a Bissell borrowed from a friend for use at our old house.I rolled the dice and bought this model based on the reviews and put it to use. We have a very light colored carpeting (almost white) in all the carpeted rooms. The carpet is 6 years old and Wow, this cleaner did an outstanding job cleaning the high traffic areas and the stairs.It didn't get a few stains out but they are barely noticeable now."
4,Small but effective,"Although the product is smaller than I thought it would be, it does a very respectable cleaning job. So it takes a little longer, but I would recommend it for the results it accomplishes."
4,Very Nice Carpet Cleaner.,This is a very nice Carpet cleaner. It cleans very nicely and dries the carpet very fast. I will recommend to a friend definitely.
5,GREAT!,"Great machine. Does everything I want it to. Was concerned about the small tanks, but makes the machine a lot lighter, worth it in the end...My back's not killing me. Easy to move around. Down side- short cord- easy fix, small extension cord. Glad I made the purchase. My mom borrows it regularly and loves it too."
5,best Steam Vac ever,This steam vac is the best one that I've used. It really gets the deep down dirt out.
4,This cleans great!,"I've used this twice now - it works very well, although I think a professional service can get out the deep traffic stains better than this cleaner. I like seeing all the soil that comes up in the tank - I know I'm not wasting my time!"
4,wheres the steam,"Its easy to use,and clean after use. From the product title ""SteamVac"" i was thinking i was getting a unit that heated the cleaning solution. It does not. I use very hot water and that helps. The attachments are a pain to use and do not work very well. I could do the same with my ShopVac and a spray bottle. I have put them away and won't use them. On the plus side the vac does pull up most of the water and gets the dirt out."
3,SteamVac Carpet Cleaner,"This vac does a good job cleaning, but it takes a longer time to clean the vac after using than it does to clean the rugs. After a time the vacuum (about 3 months) begins to loose suction and it does not pick up the water as well as when it was newer"
3,LEAKING LIKE A RIVER,"Purchased last week and used this weekend. FYI you have to run the machine with solvent over the area first, break it apart clean everything then fill it with water to run it over the same area again. This makes sense since I wouldnt want soapy water residue to stay in the rug and attract dirt. After this is done you are finished. Lots of work but it beats a rental. Mine for some reason leaks big time. Once I fill it up it just keeps leaking until it empties the canister,so I am hoping for a solution from Hoover, lets see what they come up with."
5,Better than rug doctor,cleaned up our high traffic area. our sofas and our cards interior. This unit is very well made and simple to use. Best tool too have in the house now instead of renting those rug doctors machines and renting the accessories. When i have everything in one.
4,i can tell it works by the dirt output,you don't realize just how how quickly your carpet gets dirty (yuck) and this does the job!this is an investment but renting a carpet cleaner or having it professionally done regularly would cost much more...the convenience of having your own machine is great...especially for the pet owneri wish that I would have made this investment long gothis machine is easy to use and clean
3,a bit disopointed,"it is ok, for a very small job. thought this would be my answer to calling in the professionals.Sorry it is not , on the flip side I do not regret buying this product as it is fine for some of my rugs and furniture maintance cleaning"
5,I Love It!,"I used this product for the first time today and I liked the way it cleaned my floor rugs. I would strongly suggest though, that all the instructions be read before use because if not used property, too much water could accumulate and soak your rug. Since I have hardwood floors I steam vaccumed the rugs in the garage and let them dry fully before bringing them in. But in the case of a wall to wall rug, there could be a problem if too much water accumulates with improper use and cause a mildew problem."
5,Great product- well worth it,I was skeptical about a household appliance vs a professional truck mounted version but I love this product. It works very well and much better expected. The container only holds enough water for 1 room but any larger and it would be difficult to move. It's heavy but I would expect that and it still moves easily. I only wish I bought it sooner. I pushed and pushed to snap the clean surge into place and got nothing but the unit does not leak so maybe they did change this version. I purchasing in June 2008.
4,My new steamer,"I really like this steamer. I have four kids and two dogs, one is a puppy, and I use it about every other day. It cleans very well and the only thing that I do not like about it is the length of the cord, it needs to be much longer but it is something that I can live with!"
3,Works well enough,"It does the job okay, and it paid for itself the first time I used it. My carpet was pretty dirty, and it looks substantially better after, but not almost new, as some reviewers have said. I have read that the key is to go SLOW. So slow, I went, but to my disappointment, I needed to refill the water quite often, which was annoying. The next time I use it, I plan to go over the carpet, let it dry completely, then go over it again the next day. I suspect that will produce better results. Three stars is because of the inconvenient frequent water changes for a room approx. 500 square feet."
5,"Better than the V2, I own both","Easy to assemble, easy to use. I like the clean surge button that adds more solution on demand when you hit the real dirty spots. What I like about this model better than the more expensive one (V2)is you can use REALLY HOT water. The V2 used a hard plastic container for water and it stresses under real hot water. I also had numerous issues with valves on my V2.Back to the F5914-900, from what I can see it pushes and pulls the water as good as the more expensive model and even though you do not have a true rinse with it (V2 does)it seems not needed as the carpet dries and feels like you got all the soap out. Very impressive unit and I highly recommend it to pet owners."
3,Dont expect profesional results on a single pass.,"Pros: easy to use, easy to put together. Good suction. Cons: leaves thicker piles very wet. Many trips to fill up and empty. Well soiled rugs take more than one pass to get a full cleaning. In short: good steam cleaner if you use on a regular basis. If you haven't cleaned your rugs in awhile expect to spend entire day doing an averages size carpet."
5,I love my steamvac,"I am so glad I bought this steamvac! I was a little nervous to try and clean the carpets myself instead of having them done professionally, but it really was very easy and I think this machine did a better job than the last time I had my carpets professionally done! Really a good product"
5,great cleaner,THIS UNIT DOES EXACTLY WAS IT IS ADVERTISED TO DO. THIS IS MY THIRD HOOVER PRODUCT. AND LOVE THEM ALL.... I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS STEAMVAC WITH CLEAN SURG
4,Great product for allergy sufferers!,"Unfortunately I am allergic to cat dander, and have experienced using carpet cleaning companies and renting steam cleaning machines with horrible allergic results due to the cleaners being used at cat infested houses! This cleaner is by far the best alternative to rentals and companies, as it cleans the carpet nearly as well as the companies, and much better than rentals. THe only downside is the small tank. If you have a large house, the dirty water tank will need to be emptied quite a bit. We used this unit alongside another similar unit costing 3 times as much, and this one far exceeded the other units cleaning ability. Worth the money."
5,"Easy, quick, effective","I'm very pleased with my new carpet shampooer. Initially, I was debating renting a shampooer or having my rugs professionally cleaned. At first I didn't consider buying a steam/vac because I assumed it would cost too much for one that would do a good job. I read reviews on several machines before I made my selection and I made the right choice. It was easy to assemble--only a couple parts to put together, easy to use, the carpets cleaned up nicely, and the suction was sufficient so that the rugs dried quickly. And, I saved money with the first use because a professional job would have cost more than what I paid for the machine. What more could I ask for?"
4,Hoover SteamVac works well,"I like this carpet shampooer. It works well and does a very good job of pulling the water back out of the carpet. So once you finish, the carpet dries in an hour or so...which is a real plus for me. I'd borrowed a friend's Bissell a few times before deciding to purchase my own shampooer, and I had to set up fans and wait a few hours before the carpet would dry.My only ""complaint"" is all the tubing for the upholstery attachments, it frequently comes loose from the clips on the back of the shampooer and gets in the way. So if you don't use the upholstery attachment, you may find it convenient to stash all of that in a closet somewhere!All in all, a very good product!"
5,Cleanest carpet I ever had !,"The Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surgeis the best carpet cleaner that I have ever used. As a custodian in the local grade school, I have used many different carpet cleaning systems and the Hoover is the very best.I have had big dogs on my carpet for years but the carpet that I thought could never be clean is better than ever.I was also impressed at the way it cleaned up my furniture of all the drooling from our Bloodhound.This carpet cleaner is very easy to use and works like no other.If I had to buy one a year, I would, just to get the wonderful results without having to hire someone to come to my house to do it once a year. The price is even cheaper than having it commercially cleaned and I can do it once a week. Great Job Hoover !!! Keep up the good work.Thank's to Amazon for making my purchase easy and my life much cleaner."
5,Does a tremondous job.,We were a little skeptical since we had previously used Bissell machines. We were lured into buying our Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge by a variety of reviews and the fact that our old Bissel was a leaker.We have cleaned over 3000 square feet of carpet without a problems --- and it did a fantastic job. So far the Hoover has lived up to it's reputation as the best carpet shampooer on the market for the price.
5,Works great!,Was shipped fast and works great! Also an steal of a price! We told our friends to buy it on here!
5,You'll be amazed!,"You will be so amazed if you purchase this product, begin using it on your carpet and watch the dirt, hair and you name it coming up! I had a small space so I vacuumed frequently, sometimes everyday, and this thing still brought up enough junk that it looked like I had never vacuumed! It's pretty easy to use once you get down how all the pieces go together. The only thing I'm not that fond of is the way the cleaning solution comes out of the upholstery attachment (when you press the handle to push out solution it comes out significantly below the brush - hard to explain), but once I got the hang of it, it seems fine. Overall I am amazed at the power of this product, especially for the price. My carpets and couch cushions are soooo clean!"
4,Hoover F5914-900: SteamVac with clean surge,This is a fine product with a great price. This was a replacement for a older model which also served us well.Delievery time was over night for us. Could not have asked for. Thank You.
2,Hoover Steam Vac,"I recently purchased a Hoover Steam Vac from you. The Vac works well, however on the second use, the clip that holds the upright part of the Vac broke off which makes it very difficult to do stairs or move to the second floor. The reason I replaced our old Hoover Steam Vac was the very same thing. I would suggest you contact the Hoover Company and tell them of the poor construction. I tried to tell Hoover about my problem but they recommend I go to one of their dealers. Hope you can help"
5,"So far, so good","I've just had the SteamVac for a couple of months, and I've only used it twice, but both times have been satisfactory. The first time was on a basement family room that had been flooded with some outside water, dirt, etc. No prob. Dry in a flash. Then, on the second job, I kept getting mud up from the 30 yr. old kitchen carpet. I knew it was going to be nasty, but no matter how many times I went over an area, the water was picked up so well that the floor was, again, dry in a flash. I do wish the front clear cover could be easily removed to get lint and gunk out that accumulates, but overall I'm very happy with it."
4,good product but not professional grade,"for what it's supposed to do, it does it well. maybe i read too much into the description but i expected it to do more as far as getting out older stains. it's called a steamvac but it calls for hot water, not steaming or boiling. it still works great on fresh stains. i had just hoped for more on old ones."
4,Worked great!,"I purchased this a few weeks ago and used it for the first time this last weekend. I think it works great! As long as you pre-treat the deep dirt stains, they come up just fine. But, even the professionals have to pre-treat. Carpet smells nice and looks great!"
5,great carpet cleaner,Great carpet cleaner I had a lot of old stains and it got them out without a lot of hard work. Onboard attachements work wonderful. You do have to change and add water often but you can get a good sized room done without having to stop. I have used other cleaners but none got out all my stains the price was not bad for this model.
2,Heavy and bad tools,I think this product is to heavy and hard to move around it also seems to have really cheap tools that fall off and don't have good suction. It also leaks soaking the floor when stoping to change the water which makes another mess to clean up. It is also quite loud. On a positive note it does have good suction when you are not using the attachments and I do like the spin brushes. I think I will stay with my bissel
3,Just OK,"Pros:Cleans wellYou can mix your own shampooDon't have to use Hoover shampooAlso scrubs floorsCons:Small tank, need to empty and refill oftenA bit loudHose storage doesn't work, best not to store hose on unit"
1,Worked great for half an hour,"Worked greet for half an hour.....when I lifted Romerom one level to another, the whole back broke off - like it split in two and there is no way to fix it. Junk after half an hour."
4,"Cheap, effective, and ideal for small dwellings","This steam vacuum is a very good investment. It is cheap and effective, but it isn't quite upto par with the deluxe steam vacuums you can rent at your grocery stores.Because of its relatively small size, the vaccuum is ideal for small dwellings. With each fill of hot water and carpet detergent, one can clean around 150-220 sq ft of carpet effectively. Changing the container can be tiresome, and one may need to change the container ten times or more for a 2000 sq ft house.The overall cleaning prowess is very acceptable. It is nothing special and one may need to steam vacuum the same carpet multiple times in order to get the most of the dirt out. But then again, I found this to be true even with the deluxe steam vacuums.From the cost effective perspective, it is hard to beat this steam vacuum. I highly recommend it for those who live in small dwellings"
5,perfect,Does everything the manufacturer said it would do. Not that I enjoy cleaning carpets but I love having clean carpets.
1,1/2 hour's worth,"Read reviews and decided to order. Easy to put together. Worked well for two rooms of carpet. refilled and changed container twice. Then I decided to use clean water in container to remove any soap residue and suction stopped working. Removed, cleaned and replaced everything. Still nothing. Called customer service and waited twice about 20 minutes on hold. Went through all the steps again with them, nothing happened. Finally, the rep perhaps it needed to 'rest' even though it had not been on for over an hour now. Two days later there is still no suction and I tried customer service again. We went through the same troubleshooting process and still did not work. So I am returning cleaner to Amazon."
2,Missing bolts in box,I haven't used it yet because we received the carpet cleaner and it was missing the bolts. I was hoping to get some carpets cleaned before thanksgiving. Now I have to wait to call hoover when they are opened.
5,glad I read the reviews!,"So far so good! I am very pleased with the performance. The instructions are clear and the cleaner really sucks up the dirt. I haven't tried the accessories yet or the attachment for the stairs but from what I read, there shouldn't be a problem. It was very easy to clean after steaming, too. Definately would recommend!"
3,Good but not as great as others describer,"We liked it but didn't work as well as others described. Leaves carpet streaky in the dirtiest areas. We just bought our carpet 9 months ago and its a very expensive carpet. About $47 per sq/yd without padding or installation. Its a beige color and with kids and a dog it got dirty fast. We used the steamvac twice in 2 weeks. Both times it pulled up alot of dirt. Also, the second time we used oxyclean as everyone on here said and that worked much better. But after each clean, it leaves the carpet somewhat streaky. Especially in the dirtiest parts. For the money, I would definitely buy it again but it didn't work as everyone else described. Not on my carpets anyway."
5,Hoover steam cleaner,"This steam cleaner worked great,rugs came out as clean or better than a rented steam cleaner. It was worth the price I paid and I can use it any time I want. This product I would tell any one that it a great unit,easy to use and easy clean up of unit. I rate this A+."
2,Great product,"Product was as expected, works great, love the upholstery cleaner which is the one thing our last shampooer was lacking, cleans our sectional of all the mess left behind by my children!Edit...I have had this product for a year and maybe used it 5 times...the hose attachment for the upholstery cleaner has broke and constantly comes out spraying water EVERYWHERE...the only reason I didn't give one star was because for regular carpet cleaning it works well enough..."
5,Good value,"Excellent carpet cleaner. Have used it to clean 2 rooms in the house. one carpet had an old mold spot which the cleaner was able to mostly remove, the other had a stinky pet odor smell which was also removed. For the price, this is a great cleaner."
5,Excellent Product!,"I am cleaning my carpets right now and just had to stop and write a review. I love this machine!!!! I have pets, a husband and grandkids, so I have dirt stains, drink stains, pee stains, you name it I've got it. This Hoover is a miracle. No more being on my hands and knees scrubbing with my SpotBot. I followed everybody's advice and put boiling hot water in the tank and the miracle begins!!!!"
3,Good if you only use it once!,"I bought this a year ago. It works great the first time, maybe twice. Then every time I went to use it, it would NOT suck up the dirty water. I fiddled with it enough to get it to work a couple of times, but it consistently stops. It's just way too temperamental. None of these upright cleaners work very well, but I was especially disappointed with this one. When it cleans, it cleans very well. But I don't have time to baby it."
5,Great Product,"I read the reviews for this carpet cleaner and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. This thing really does the job. Our carpet was in pretty bad shape so I cleaned it twice and now it looks great. I've had our carpet cleaned by ""professionals"" before but they just try to get in and out as quickly as possible. I was able to do a better job with this machine by taking my time and going over areas that needed extra attention."
4,Works fine for small areas,"This is a much better shampooer than the last one I had, different brand all together. Works well in small spaces, or small areas of carpeting. Once I figured out how to change the settings it worked even better!!! I would recommend this to someone that may from time to time need to clean the carpets in a small room."
1,Consistently inconsistent,"Second piece of garbage steam vac I bought from Hoover. As with the first one (an earlier model) this piece of garbage sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It always drops water (and it ONLY has the word 'steam' if you put your own hot water in); however, as with the previous model the suction sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. I check the tank, the suction, everything...it just does not have suction consistently. I'm just DONE with this company. I just finished soaking up the water with a towel. I was hoping Hoover fixed the problem with the newer model...guess not. Or I'm just unlucky buying Hoovers through Amazon."
2,Had to have 2 replacements sent,"I was quite disappointed in the quality of this machine. The first machine one of the rotator brushes broke off the first time I was using it. The second one the control mechanism was improperly installed at the factory and made the machine useless. I am waiting for my 3rd machine from Amazon. If the next one does not work right, I will just get a refund and get and different machine."
3,"Poor Manual, wrong size bolts","Bought cleaner a month ago because we need to clean carpets before next company comes. Still can't use! Delivered with 3"" bolts whereas 4 1/2"" bolts are needed. Got nasty email after trying to get help on-line. Was told to call.Called Hoover and talked to a very courteous person. She promised to send some replacement parts right away. She also had no parts list or descriptions and said maybe some other department might have, or a ""local"" dealer might have the correct part or part desctiption. Lost her and got back to the recordings and hung up.It's rotten living in a country where we can not compete and cut costs to the bone selling imported stuff. God help us."
4,all in all good,I works really well. I boil the water before pouring it in the tank so that extra step really seems to help.
3,Cleaning Tile Floors,"This product is advertised to clean hard floors as well as carpets which was important to me. What it doesn't mention in any of the information I read when researching this cleaner is that not all parts come with the cleaner, another piece is needed to clean tile and hard floors. It was hard to figure this out since the online demo does not show cleaning tile floors, there was just a short blurb in the paper instructions included with the cleaner. When I tried to contact customer support over the weekend to find out if I was missing a piece I found the help line is only M-F, 8-5. They were not much help for a weekend project. When customer support did respond to my request they confirmed that the piece for cleaning tile did need to be purchased separately. It did do a good job but it would have been nice to know about the missing piece before I started the project."
1,Leaked like a waterfall,I got a defective unit and had to return it for a new one. Water was leaking everywhere on or off.Hopefully the next one won't leak.
3,NO PRICE ADJUSTMENT,"RECEIVED A HOOVER STEAM VAC ON 1/28/11 AND PAID 136.95. CHECKED AMAZON ON 1/29/11 AND ITEM IS NOW 8.00 CHEAPER. UNLIKE OTHER BUSINESS'S, AMAZON WILL NOT MAKE A PRICE MATCH. THIS IS THE LAST ITEM I'LL PURCHASE FROM AMAZON."
2,Piece of crap,"Has several engineering flaws. I don't feel like listing them, but this machine is really annoying to use. It does a fair job if you have loads of patience."
1,A piece of crap that works once or twice,"Hoover steam vacuums are junk. I bought one and it worked once. I took it for service. The service center said the company failed to attach a part that permits me to vacuum my wood floors. I took the steam vacuum home and it still does not work.This is sad because when I put too much water on my hardwood floors I ruin my floors--which I did by useing Hoover's steam vacuum. Avoid this product and the Hoover company products. Theirfloor polisher also is no good---worked 5-6 times and plastic gears inside already no good. PLASTIC GEARS! That is called planned destructions. Any company that makes the key parts out of plastic is working-over the buyer. I strongly advise people to avoid Hoover products. Price may be cheap but their products are worthless. Buy at your own risk.RM Borland, M.D., Ph.D."
1,lost in transit,Order this because of all the wonderful comments.Item was lost in transit and it had to be cancelled. Boo hoo
3,Excellent clearner but short life span,"This machine does an excellent job cleaning. However I gave it 3 stars because the life span is less than 2 years. I've already gone through a couple of these machines including the one that broke yesterday when spin brush quits spinning. The same thing happened to my previous one. If they make this a lot more durable, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Great steam cleaner,"Great purchase. Very simple to use and easy store away. For the price, you can't get much better quality. Suction is great. Picks up alot of the water dispensed. I used to rent the industrial looking steam vacs at the local Lowes or Home Depot for $30 a pop. This one works just as good, if not better. Very satisfied customer."
5,I'll never pay for carpet cleaning again.....,"This is our SECOND Hoover Steam-Vac. The other one lasted 11 years, two houses, two kids, four cats and two German Shepherds. We gave the old one (still working) to my wife's little sister that just got a place of her own. We're kinda picky when it comes to our furniture/carpet and the Hoover Steam Vac keeps the upholstery and carpets in top shape w/o calling Stanley Steemer! The ""Hand-Attachment Scrubber"" is EXCELLENT for hitting a small spot like when your four-year-old drops a container of BLUE yogurt on the den carpet. It makes short work of small jobs and is easy to operate and utilize all of the features when a bigger task is at hand such as WHOLE HOUSE carpet cleaning. Summary....it is an AWESOME cleaner! We highly reccomend."
5,Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner,"Great machine! My carpets haven't looked this good in a long while. My carpets are 15+ years old and this machine has made them look almost new again. It picks up the water so well that it takes no time for my carpet to dry. Great investment, should of purchased one sooner."
4,Cleaning a bit hard,"Works great,easy to use.The only problem is cleaning the pieces afterword.The front piece does not come off and even though they give you a tool its hard to get that part clean.Also I thought I got a great price but two weeks later a large appliance store had it for half the price I paid."
4,Solid Value (and some decade old irritants),"This is my second basic Hoover Steamvac. The first broke after nine years. I once owned a home in which all the rooms were carpeted, I now have about 40% of the living space carpeted, and I clean my home carpets (and car carpets) two or three times a year. So I am probably a medium duty household user. I bought the second unit because I was satisfied with the first and the new model is about 25% less expensive than when I originally bought.The Good - Easy to assemble, intuitive to use, cleans well, drys well, tool to remove hair from vacuum portion is very handy.The Bad - A little heavy (but I can live with that) AND after a DECADE Hoover still has not figured out to handle the attachment hose - it is still a PITA as it can be counted on to fall off of the handle every 10 or 15 minutes when the hose is not in use.The Ugly - Same basic look after a DECADE has not aged well (but who really cares)All in all a good basic unit with some minor irritants."
4,Great with one flaw,"I bought this with the intentions of using it to clean my tile floors. Unfortunately, even though it is equipped to handle cleaning hard floors, you need to buy an attachment. Fortunately, I found one at a nearby dealer for about $10. My tile floor is not level and the tile edges can catch the attachment and pull it off. It just pops on there but still frustrating to have to stop and put it on.It cleaned our furniture, making them feel super soft. Does great on carpeting.It was not able to get up some fresh stains off the carpeting. That may be due to the potentially weak cleaning solution that comes with the unit.Other than that, I love it."
2,Alright when it works.,"I bought mine last week, use it once and will return it this week. The problem with the machine is that it leaks so much; with or without the motor running. I called Hoover service dept and they said that I have a broken unit, told me to send it back for repair. The leaked solution thoroughly soaked my carpet and it's still damp after 2 days. I noticed that I'm not the only person with this problem.Update:Amazon promptly sent me another machine that doesn't leak. When the machine does not leak, it does a decent job of cleaning the carpet and the sofa. If I could change the star rating, I would give it a 3.5 stars."
3,Clean the Indicator Screen Often!,"OK cleaner, but does not hold up as well as the predecessor Hoover model I owned for a couple of years. I've had this machine for a year and cleaned up all the crud left by kids, pets, and messy guests. I'd say my usage amount has been average to light. Use the recommended amounts of soap and HOT water and it does a decent job. The problem for me has been the the scrubbing brushes. I learned (the hard way) that if you do not keep the indicator screen very clean, the brushes will stop and the machine will break. Getting warranty service at my local repair shop was not a problem. The tech said he has been getting a run on repairs for these machines. Same problem, dirty screen equals seized brushes. I'm thinking my next carpet cleaner might not be a Hoover SteamVac."
4,Good Value,This cleaner was better than I expected. I bought it for high traffic area cleanup and it exceeded my expectations. It is easy to use and has a quick drying time. The only negative I have is that the soap container should be larger than one gallon.
4,Durable,"After having two steamers break down in a matter of a year, I'm very pleased with this one. I use this around once a week, lug and up and down my basement stairs and it still works as good as the first time. The attachments come in handy, though they can be kind of a pain to attach and detach.My only gripe: sometimes you have to open and slightly re-adjust the fill tank because even if it's empty it just will not suck up any water."
4,Good for carpet bad for bare floor,"I was really really hoping this product would be the solution to cleaning the textured tile we have in the kitchen- the tile I have to scrub on my hands and knees. Sadly I was disappointed. On bare floor a mop works better than this product. However, on carpet- it rocks. It's much easier to use when compared to the units you rent to clean carpet- its like using a vacuum. It pulled so much dirt and dog hair out of my carpet. A great product for carpet, but skip it if you're looking for it to work on bare floor."
2,Hoover SteamVac F5914-900,"The motor seemed to get louder the second day I used it, but I wasn't sure. The fifth time I used it, the motor went bad. Replacement from Amazon was very easy. I had a new one delivered in two days. I hope I have better luck with this one. The steamvac did a great job when I was able to use it. The replacement one is not as loud."
1,Defective for sure,"I cannot in good conscience give this anymore than. 1 star rating. I ignored the reviews that stated it leaks, but it does. As opposed to the first review who says there is some sort of pre use procedure to do, there is NONE. At first it was great, then after a while it started to leak through the little holes on the bottom and nothing would stop it...no advice at all from these reviews, nothing.Luckily Amazon was awesome and did a return with no hassles as usual. I love amazon but only ""wanted"" to like this machine. Thumbs down."
2,ok but -,We have had this unit for 2 years - it died today a fast but smelly death. Even though ours is the pet version - doesn't matter. 1 German Shepherd will kill it in a year or two. I have yet to see a cleaner do any better. Also wish it didn't leak - we have to pull the tanks to store it.And even with that said I'm buying another one.
1,Received a used item,"I ordered this cleaner from Amazon, I ordered a new item, nowhere it said I would received a refurbished used item. The body was marked all over, manufacturing stickers had been manually half removed and marks on the body of the cleaner. I am more mad about receiving a used product than about the product itself even though the fabrication looks very cheap."
1,Horrible service,"I ordered a new Hoover carpet cleaner through Amazon. I got it in the mail and began putting it together and noticed it had been used. The brissols were stretched out and there was cleaning solution in the tank. I called to tell them and I simply got ""sorry we'll send you a new one"". I told them I didn't want to deal with the type of business that is going to scam by selling something full price and then sending a used product. He assured me it wouldn't happen again. So I got a different one in the mail 2 days later. Got it out and put it together only to find out it was used as well. When I called them back again there were no appologies, I just got an ""okay just return it"". I got a refund and will never deal with Amazon again. They didn't even go out of their way to try and fix the problem. They have horrible customer service and horrible work ethic!"
1,SHAME ON YOU HOOVER! DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!,"STOPPED VACUUMING FIRST TIME OUT OF BOX!!! Finally got it to suction again. Second use out of the box, NO SUCTION AT ALL!!!! HOOVER CUSTOMER SERVICE - WHAT A LAUGH. Called the so called ""authorized service center"" in my city and he was too busy to take my call. Now I'm on my hands and knees using my 15 year old Bissell Little Green Machine vacuuming up the water the Hoover left in my carpet."
1,Hoover Steamvac--You Broke My Heart,"As a bit of a vacuum connoisseur and a lifelong Hoover brand loyalist, I was disappointed with this product. I have a 17-year old basset hound who is having some 'bladder issues' and I really thought that once again Hoover would come through for me. Unfortunately, I was surprised at the quality of this Hoover product. The vacuum is very heavy. So heavy that my wife cannot carry it up the stairs. I was also very disappointed that it takes at least 2 tanks of water and formula, and at least 2 emptying of the waste tanks per room! Way too much time.I guess I got what I paid for, as the product does indeed clean the carpets. But I would strongly recommend something else if you plan on cleaning entire rooms at a regular rate. Too heavy, too much water, too many empties to get the job done. Again, as a brand loyalist, I was very surprised to find that this had the Hoover logo on it. I will choose my more carefully next time. Skip it!"
4,"Great Carpet Cleaner, very good product!","Found that this product, Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner a very real good Carpet Cleaner. I bought it on sale, feel that I got a very good product that work, does what I want, basic Carpet Cleaner, I feel that I got great deal. Thank You!"
1,Sold me a used one when I paid for a new one,"Just wanted to vent my frustration with online ordering through amazon especially on this particular steam vac. I purchase a new one and what was delivered was a used/refurbished product. The box was open previously and vac didn't look anything like new. This just gives me pause and makes me want to go buy at a brick and mortar store like sears, best buy or lowes."
1,Badly designed,"Over 2500 reviews for this product and it's junk. I realized after reading the reviews that it would take time to assemble and was prepared for it. Assembly took an hour - instructions are ridiculous. Took more than an hour to figure out how to use it. In the end I just could not figure it out and packed it to return. Never again! I'm a technical writer and have written numerous instruction manuals for really complicated things but this instruction manual is the worst I've ever come across.I don't know why Hoover would design something so complicated. Really disappointed. And yes, the quality is pretty bad - cheap plastic. I'd bought a Bissell few months ago - it was great. The only reason I returned it was it didn't come with a staircase tool. I'm going back to Bissell. It was well made, I could use it right away and it cleaned very well. The only reason I picked this Hoover was the over 2500 good reviews it got.Don't waste your time and money on this."
1,Not very well made carpet cleaner and avoid buying from Sears,"Stay away from this carpet shampooer. Shampooer broke down after a couple of uses. I took it to Sears, where I purchased it. After 3 weeks in their possession, I got a call from their repair center and was told that Hoover was repaired, and if I can come to be picked up. After about 30 minutes of waiting, they brought me the broken shampooer and informed me that Sears is not repairing Hoovers anymore, even if I purchased this unit in Sears and it was still under warranty. I took it to local vacuum cleaner store and told them my dilemma. The store owner told me about quite a few people with same problems who came to him and also showed me about 10 Hoover shampooers waiting for repairs. Two lessons are to be learned. 1st. Do not by Hoover and 2nd avoid buying from Sears."
1,Never again,"Bought this item in May 2009. July 19, 2009 it quit. From day one I found it bulky and difficult to assemble. When it worked, it would do a good job but the bottom tank would rarely sit correctly on the first try. I have always respected Hoover but now I wonder..."
1,Plastic Crap From China,"Well I am sorely disappointed after reading all the reviews about this machine. It took over 45 minutes to put together and worked for all of 10 minutes before the handle release mechanism cracked off in the mody of the machine. There are almost no metal parts to this except the bolts that hold the handle on. It was poorly packaged by the manufacturer and then shipped in the original box by Amazon allowing for damage. I suspect the housing of the machine was cracked before I ever started using it. The handle wouldn't stay up very tightly and if the handle doesn't stay in place the machine doesn't work right. Once again, another very unappealing purchase."
1,"Had a defective product, no support from Hoover","I bought this unit 2 years ago, used it once and only did a hallway.I went to use it the SECOND time and it imploded. The motor chewed up part of the plastic base, spit plastic all over my floor and that was the end. It clearly had some sort of manufacturing defect from the start.I just called Hoover Customer Service. They were not willing to do anything for me. I explained I will nto buy their product again and instead buy Bissel and the supervisor was OK with that.This is not a company I will do business with in the future. I was extremely polite and professional in dealing with them and they clearly do not care about retaining a Customer. I will spend my money elsewhere. The good news is that I still have a practically FULL bottle of cleaner.It did a good job the first time I used it so if you feel lucky, go for it. :)"
4,Hoover steam cleaner,This steam cleaner is an excellent value for the price. It has easily paid for itself 3 or 4 times over. A very good product for carpet cleaning with out using a professional company.
5,So easy to clean carpets,"After reading recomendation, I bought the Hoove SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge. It worked great! I didn't have the spot remover for pretreatment, but the old spots came out anyway. I followed the excellent direactions in the manuel, but used the dry setting for 4 times instead of the two, and the carpet dried very fast. The machine is also very easy to clean, easy to get ready to use, and easy to put away. When my cat throws up hairballs, it's quick and easy to get the carpet clean again. I think it is well worth the money and highly recomend it."
3,Nice cleaner but upholstery/Hand tools dissapoint,I purchased this model mostly because i have carpeted stairs in my home so i needed the hand tools. I love this machine for regular carpet cleaning but am very dissapointed in the upholstery/hand tools. The water sprays out from behing your hand tools in a wide path from way behind your hand tool and it sucks. You also get a handtool with a spinning brush that looks like a great item but as soon as you lay the brush on a surface to clean it stops spinning because the power running the brush is just to weak. On a bare cloor MAYBE? On carpet no way. I give this model a 5 for regular cleaning but a 1 for the handtool cleaning. If you dont need the handtools purchase the machine without them. Dont pay extra for this machine because of the handtools.
4,"Leaked, but warranty was easily honored","Pros:1. Did a fabulous job and removed lots of dirt!2. When I had problems, the warranty was easily honored.Cons:1. Assembly slightly tricky. I still have trouble snapping the attachment hose on the back of the shampooer for strorage. I wouldn't have my mom try to assemble it on her own, but I did okay.2. After a few days of use, it started leaking out the bottom (clean water leak.) Other reviewers had me worried that it was something I did wrong in assembly. I called the 1-800 number and they referred me to a repair shop just a mile away. I printed out my Amazon receipt. They fixed it (it did take them a week) and said that the pump assembly hadn't been put together properly in the factory (nothing I did.) There was no charge to me.I do worry from other comments about leaking that this is a common problem in this product. However, the fix was easily done, and I'm happy with this shampooer."
3,okay,"I've used the steamvac twice now: once with only hot water and the second time with the attached cleaner. The first time, the water was dark brown. There was definitely lots of dirt in the carpet. Our carpet is 1.5 yrs old. As far as the appearance, the carpet looked about the same. The traffic area remained. I was disappointed. After using the cleaner, the carpet looked better but I had used the entire bottle on one very small room. It eats up the cleaner quickly. It only picked up 50% of the traffic stain. I am not sure if it's because my carpet is short or the kind of carpet I have just doesn't look new. Anyway, I had high expectations due to the reviews but I am glad I have something. Even though I don't see a big difference, I trust (from the dirty water) that it is cleaning my carpet. Sorry, I wish I had a better review."
4,A great product,Once assembled correctly it works great. It went together easily but then wouldn't spray soap when the main trigger was pulled. I disassembled it completely and found the 2 plastic rods controling the 2 spray buttons were reversed at the factory. Works fine now.
3,"Great Value, Don't Expect Miracles","I'm tired of paying hundreds of dollars to send out my rugs for cleaning, so I decided to try out a home carpet cleaner. I settled on the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900, because it had the best reviews and cost less than a single carpet cleaning, so I didn't have much to lose. It definitely lifts dirt, which you can see when you use it and when you empty the water. But on a variety of rugs, it didn't work any miracles, leaving behind stains (even with pretreatment). Nonetheless, I'm happy with the purchase and will continue to use it for regular carpet maintenance. As a bonus, it's a nice mop replacement for kitchen and bathroom floors, leaving them fairly dry afterwards (although I wish I could lower the brushes more to get into the grout). They also need to change the name, as this model doesn't use steam at all."
4,Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge,"After reading most of the reviews, I ordered this steam cleaner and had it within a week of placing my order. I was impressed by the quickness of delivery. When putting it together, I followed the instructions/suggestions of a reviewer and had no problems at all. It's not a professional machine so I didn't expect professional cleaning results but I was amazed at how well it did. The best thing about owning a steam cleaner is I don't have to block out a day to rent one so I can clean all my rooms on the same day. I just pull it out, clean one room each week. When all the rooms have been cleaned, I start over. That is so great."
4,Cranky sometimes but a work horse,"After 3 years of working fine (has its moods), it stopped sucking the dirty water yesterday. We tried everything, starting with cleaning the suction part, making sure that the water tanks are sealed properly etc. Spent an hour trying to figure out. Then I read a blog online which showed a similar problem. If you are at your wit's end trying to figure out the bad suction, remove the dirty water tank and under it (on left side if you are behind the cleaner) is a 2 inch round and 3 inch deep hole. This should have a black rubber seal in place. In our case the seal had fallen off. After reinserting it, the cleaner worked just fine!"
3,Solution tank leaks-not covered by warranty,"This machine cleans great, but the solution tank leaked after the third use. I called Hoover customer service to get the tank replaced and was told it was not covered under the warranty. The CSR gave me 20% off and free shipping, but I do not think you should have to pay for a flawed part on a new machine. Very disappointed in warranty and when I replace this machine I will likely pony up and buy the more expensive (and sturdily built) Rug Doctor from [...]."
4,fun to use,"setup is not well documented, just ok. good price. easy to use. works well.the only problem is: toooo heavy when it's fully loaded."
3,Disappointing,"I've had a Hoover carpet cleaner before but it stopped sucking up water (and no one wanted to fix it). So I bought this one based on reviews. But it is not as good as my old one.One, it seems cheaper (and some plastic on my old one broke quickly so I fear for this one as well).Two, very hard to put together. The screws wouldn't line up properly and there was a lot of fidgeting with them.Three, smaller water bucket than my old one. What a disappointment.Four, you can't pop off the front cover over the brush and rinse it out (like my old one). You have use the plastic rod they give you (which doesn't do the job thoroughly) OR (no kidding) pour water on the floor and suck it up with the cleaner. No thanks.Five, fewer brushes than my old one. Seems like less friction to get up stains and dirt.Once I did get it all assembled, it worked well but again, it is heavier on my arm than my old one (and the old one was heavy).I got this for a good price but I am still thinking of returning it."
1,It lasted only 5 months.,"When this worked it was great...however, it broke after only a few months of use and I am greatly disappointed."
4,A lot of BANG for the buck,I found the producy easy to use. It cleans well. Only down side is it could pick up more water. How ever our carpets were dry in 12 hours.
4,Worth getting,"I bought this to deal with a pet issue. I have used both rental units and home units and at first I thought I had made a mistake. The carpet was soaked and nothing was picking up. Took the recovery tank off and reseated it and then it took off. What a great machine. Re-cleaned a new carpet and oh my gosh, a bit scary the amount of dirt if picked up. The only thing I wish it had was a separate tank for the solution so I could switch between cleaning and rinsing."
3,"Works great, STOPPED suctioning after 3rd use",This product cleans the carpets better than all 5 of the past carpet cleaners I have had in the past. Unfortunately it stopped suctioning water after the 3rd time I used it. I was so so so disappointed because I really wanted this to work. I have an appointment to take it to the nearest hoover dealer to get it fixed. Very disappointed.
4,"Great for Stains, not for deep smells or pet urine","this cleaner performs exactly as promised, but is really only able to clean the top 1/2"" to 3/4"" of carpet - which is the visible part - so it's great for stains and general cleaning. If you need to get down to the pad for spills that ""smell"", you'll need an additional odor neutralizer and/or a stronger suction (like a wet/dry vac) for getting the moisture up from deep down. Also, the middle brush broke the first day I used it. Otherwise, great product!"
4,good for the money,"Before we bought this cleaner we were going to have our carpets professionally done. After weighing the amount of money, the convienience of having our own cleaner, and reading the reviews, we decided to go with a Hoover and this one was hands down the best deal. We have used it clean to large rooms and a set of stairs and have been pleased so far. Some old stains came up very easily, while others did not, but we weren't expecting a miracle. Overall we have been happy with our purchase, I gave it 4 stars because it still is just not quite as good as professional, but it is still definitely worth buying."
4,"great product, could be wider","I am really happy with the product, but almost wish I would have bought the wider version. I had borrowed a friend's wider Hoover SteamVacWide V and it worked great, but all the reviews said this model was the best as far as no leaking and suction go. I have to empty and refill the containers much more often with this model because they are smaller than the Wide V, but if your carpet area is small, that isn't as much of a concern.Definately love the separate containers for clean and dirty water-that's a must in my book. Very easy to use and does a great job cleaning. The suction is excellent-even better than the rentals I've used- and my carpet dried in no time. It also comes with a bottle of carpet shampoo, which is not indicated on the box. Would definitely recommend this product, and the Hoover brand in general."
1,The brushes on my initial order wouldn't rotate,"I'm addressing the first SteamVac I received, since that's the order date you provided. However, the subsequent SteamVac you replaced it with works fine. And I appreciate the prompt customer service."
4,Clean Carpet,"Just used my new Hoover SteamVac Carpet cleaner for the first time. It was great. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean. My 10 year old carpet had lots of pet stains and heavy foot traffic. It now looks as good as a professional carpet cleaning service could make it. The last time I paid to have my carpet cleaned it was over $300.00. I paid somewhere around $135.00 for this SteamVac so it has already paid for itself. It took me two hours to clean two large rooms and a long hallway starting with vacuuming it all and it was drier than when the pros finished. Oh, and the color of the dirty water really grossed me out, so I knew it was picking up the dirt! The cleaner is heavy, but manageable (I am only 5 ft tall, under 100lbs). It got closer to the walls than the pros. I am pretty happy with this cleaner."
4,Good purchase,"After reading many reviews on this product, I can report that it performed as expected, and much better than the previous steam-vac that I owned. Although I don't seem to see the point of the Clean Surge feature, the brushes do a great job of getting the carpet clean and the powerful motor does leave the carpet nearly dry, if you go over it 2 or 3 times. It removed several stains that the old steam-vac could not remove. I did read the directions for assembly and did consult the trouble shooting guide to solve a function problem. The downside of this item is that the reservoir is a bit small and has to be emptied more frequently than my old machine. Further, if you don't get this tank seated just right, with all pieces in place, it will not operate. Overall, a good purchase for me."
2,"Too much effort, not enough reward","I never had a problem with leaking with this machine, however, I did find that it didn't clean my carpet very well. It's a bit of a hassle to use, clean and store, and I landed up giving it away after only having used it a few times (although I've actually had it since 2005). If you're going to use it a lot, then it may be a good buy for you, but for someone who had the best intentions when buying this cleaner, it landed up being a bit of a waste of money for me."
5,Hoover Steam,Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean SurgeThis machine works wonderful ! I would recommend its purchase and it was delivered swiftly by Amazon. My carpets dried quickly as well from 30 minutes to 45 minutes at the most .. if your carpets are driving you mad and your ashamed to have company buy this cleaner !
5,hoover steam vac,The hoover steam vac is exactly what I needed to clean my carpets. Itdid an excellent job on my stairs and it is simple to use and the directions were very explicit and easy to follow. My carpets look like new again. Thanks Hoover.
5,Would not want to be without this.,"We recently moved into a house with carpet and it has been many years since we have had carpet. We have two dogs, a lots of dirt in the yard, wow who knew how much of that comes in and stays on the carpet. I could not live with the dirty spots so I did some research and bought the Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge and was amazed at how well it works. It is even very easy to use on spills, I no longer scrub by hand, just whip my trusty steamvac out and take care of the problem. For me it is a must have and would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,"Ok, but missing parts","We bought this for a gift and when our children opened to use it, it was missing trigger parts. It's been a headache trying to get parts as the they keep telling us to return the item when all we need is a small part. I am not going to spend the cost of reshipping the item when it would cost less than a dollar to sent the part. Seems like a nice machine, but so far poor service. If we ever get it running we can let you know how it works."
1,worked great until it didn't,"Was really happy with this product in the first 4 months after I bought it. But, it only lasted 4 months. Scrubbers quit turning and it spit out a belt of some sort. Will never buy a Hoover again. Very Disappointed."
4,Great for price,"This carpet cleaner is easy to put together and easy to use. It also dries quickly. For the money, this is well worth it. We have a puppy and our carpets looked so much better after the first use."
5,Excellent !!!,it does deep clean the carpet well. My carpet look like new after the cleaning.I love it.
1,Piece of junk,Prepared to clean rugs and when I finished steam cleaning the rug there was no dirty water in tank...the vacuum did not pick up any waterCalled Hoover and they said take it to a dealer for repair.The dealer tried to sell me another machineSo I took the Hoover home and shipped it back to amazonEasier. To call Stanley Steamer in to clean
3,This is the way to go,"I sincerely haven't taken the product out of the box yet, but I am a single senior citizen, and have a small car. Amazon shipped this product to my door, free. Thank You Amazon!! I am sure from past experience it will work just fine when I do open it."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I have bought two Hoover Steam Cleaners, and BOTH stopped working within a short time after very little use. The first one I chalked up to just a dud machine, but when the second went bad after about five uses I contacted Hoover and offered them the chance to make it right. They sent me a generic email explaining how I could fix the problem (no suction) but I took the machine to a professional and he told me it would cost more to fix than to buy a new one. I am out about $328 (not including shipping) and the cost of the attempted repair. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. ."
1,Bad SteamVac Good Shampooer,"This is not a STEAM Vacuum. It uses warm to hot Tap water and has no heating element to boil the water to get steam. If you are looking for a Sanitizing STEAM cleaner do not buy this product. If you are looking for a decent Carpet shampooer, then this is a good buy. The name is very misleading."
2,Sucks ... not really well,This product is average at best. So many of the Hoover products seem cheaply made. We've been through MANY of them. Finally broke down and bought an Oreck. That was worth the investment.We are in our 3rd year with the Oreck and have had little trouble. It weighs less than a Hoover. Easier to move around! It does not break/jam like a Hoover.
2,"Not rigid, durable, good for couple of month.","I own this VAC for a bout 1.5 years, so the history is simple,- good for 4 month, then start falling a part, motor that spinning brushes went out, then locking switch got broken.I noticed couple of design flaws, the plastic suction cover has splitter which collects all the moisture, which is getting stuck on those splitters,In general I feel that I wasted money on this device, so I guess this device should run about 80$, for that quality,I ended up baying German brand which will last me for long, but the price tag as twice as much +."
3,reality,"the carpet cleaner works well except if you do not have the recovery tank on properly it will not pick up the waste water.i tried numerous times to put the top of the recovery tank, on to no avail,after numerous attempts i got it on,but its very hard to have it on properly so the machine will work. cordially russ"
4,cleaner carpets,"So easy to use, Came out better then my carpet did from professional cleaner. Carpets are almost dry when finished , would recommend this machine. I checked out the comments before buying and so glad I went with the favorite."
5,Great Carpet shampooer,"After reading about so many carpet cleaners I chose this one because of the ratings.I have never owned a carpet cleaner before with 5 cats and a puppy the compact carpet cleaners just weren't cutting it anymore.So easy to assemble, I did it myself. I love the machine, I like the portability and the ease of removal and replacing both tanks. I could not believe the dirt that came out of my carpet. I was so pleased that I went nuts and shampooed all the carpets in my house in no time. It has thus far cleaned every stain I put it up against. Its lightweight and made of plastic which is fine for me, not a hassle to take out. The clean surge feature is great. Overall I love this machine and how well it has cleaned my carpets. Price was right too!!"
2,Unit leaks,"The SteamVac carpet cleaner has great suction but after a few months the unit leaks. Not just a few drops....the complete tank empties onto the floor/carpet! After receiving three replacements from Amazon, I gave up and bought a different brand. Very disappointed."
3,"Leaves streaks, But quick dry.","For the price it does a good job. Small tank means you need to refill often. Great suction makes for quick dry. It did leave streaks on carpet though when cleaning, had to go over a week later to remove, and it was still just O.K. looking. I have 2 dogs who are in and out of the house all day, so Lot's of dirt is tracked in, so the carpets were extra dirty. I knew going into cleaning that they were not going to be perfect. For the price and ease of use it's a good little machine. It is not a big cleaner, nor does it preform like one. It does seam like it will last a few years."
5,Excellent carpet cleaner very happy so far,"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900A little piece broke up that keeps the handle part upright otherwise it's been a dream. Had a very similar on before and it lasted Forever so went with same type again and am happy!!"
4,Like This,"While it's not like getting the carpet professionally cleaned, I do like the results. And, it is easier to use than I expected. I can shampoo smaller areas one at a time rather than having the inconvenience of moving everything and having to stay out of my house for a day."
5,Excellent carpet cleaner!,"I don't like giving 5 star review's, but this one outshines any carpet cleaner I've used. If it were to break, I would more than likely buy the exact same one. My carpet looks brand new and took all but 45 minutes to completely dry and I've had other vac's clean very good but left my carpet soaked took day(s) to dry. I seriously can't think of one thing I would change the brushes are great, suction great, heats the water, well the tank requires frequent dumping and refilling. That's it! The tank"
3,Power wash but not durable,"I bought Hoover SteamVac last July based on the good reviews from Amazon. I only used 4 times since then and the machine sucking function is already broken. I have to send it to local Hoover dealer to fix it. I may have warranty for it but I am too busy to deal with it now. Though it does not cost me a lot to repair it the broken sucking function, it is still quite annoying the machine breaks so easily with only a few times of usage.The reason that I still give 3 *** is because the wash and clean function is still quite powerful on the carpet as a non-professional vac steamer. Another thing that I don't like this machine is the weight. I have back issue that using this machine is quite a burden to my back. I am searching for another lighweight vac steamer for my daily use to clean my dog pee."
4,"Good machine, not easy install","This machine is hard to install. Took me about an hour, made me feel like a fool as not many customers complained about it. Other than that, it worked great on carpets. Unfortunately, I got one that is leaking which needs to be repaired or replaced. But, overall a good product."
4,Hoover SteamVac,"We have dogs so this comes in real handy. Easy to get up and running,and just as easy to clean up and put away."
4,Great for home use,"This is a great product but does seem to only clean a smaller spot at a time. It covers maybe 6'x9' area while using the surge. Then you drain, refill and repeat as needed. It would take a long time to clean a large room thoroughly. We have two large dogs and a baby and really only needed to clean smaller areas, so this works great for us.It comes with a bottle of cleaner which would last for a good amount of time if you dont plan to clean large amounts."
4,Hoover Steam Vac,"Over all it is a great unit. The base unit works great on floors and really picks up the dirt quickly. The hand attachment does not work that great, and when you attach it to the base some of the cleaning solution leaks out as you use it. Hand Unit Does not have as much power as you would think it should. The Base unit has plently of power and does a awesome job. From heavy traffic areas to spring clean up, it really does a great job. I have owned 5 other units before, and by far this is the best one to have overall."
4,Hoover SteamVac - great product,"The Hoover SteamVac is easy to assemble and use. Drying time varies depending upon carpet type, I have plush white carpet (heavily stained!) that dried in 6 hours - impressive considering that some SteamVac's dry in 24 hours or more.The power hand tool works wonderfully however I did have to take mine to a Hoover repair shop since the handle was not properly assembled with the manufacture, the fix took about 15 min. and now there are no more leaks. Would highly recommend this machine to anyone, just make sure to not saturate the carpet and only use 4 strokes on each area."
5,Fantastic carpet saver!,"After a great deal of research, I chose this model and it has been absolutely fantastic!Using hot water directly from the tap and the Hoover Pet version of carpet cleaner (about 1/3 to 1/2 of recommended amount of cleaner), brought new life to my carpets.Having bought this unit to treat high trafic areas in my office, I was so impressed with the amount of dirt and grime it removed, that I decided to try it on some horrendous carpets at home.Having a cat prone to hairballs and two small children, there were numerous identifiable and unidentifiable stains that had defied previous cleaning attempts with Resolve and similar cleansers and had resisted the cleaning attempts of a Rug Doctor stream cleaning vacuum.The cleaner is loud, but no louder than any other I have tried and the carpets were completely dry within a few hours of use. I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this machine and it broke down the first day I used it. The cleaning solution tank was leaking. The seal was broken so there was no more suction. I had 5 square feet of soaked carpet. We had to go out and purchase another machine to suck up the wet carpet. I took it to a Hoover maintenance repair place because it was still under warranty. It took the maintenance shop 3 MONTHS to get a new tank from Hoover. I used it right after I got it back from the repair shop. Once again, it stopped working! It stopped sucking up the water in the carpet. So here I was once again with soaked carpet. I went to my local hardware store and rented a Rug Doctor. It did a fine job. It's built to last. I WISH I COULD GET HOOVER TO TAKE BACK THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK."
1,hoover shampooer,"The latching part on the body stopped working after the first usage. Took it in for warranty and they say it is not covered, they do cover the latch , but not the part the latch hooks onto. I could hear it rattling around inside and the latch no loner works..They would not cover the steamer part and the shop told me they had declined it. What a waste of money..they do not stand behind their products..."
3,"Great for carpet, but","Easy to assemble, all plastic construction, works very well on medium height pile. Spin scrub feature not as claimed ...very weak, if any agitation of carpet. So, don't expect it to actually scrub the carpet clean. Cleaning quality depends upon how good you pre-treat and how good the shampoo is. When used as directed it cleans very well on moderately dirty carpet.The attachments are absolutely useless. Same silly ""spin scrub"" design. The sprayer on the furniture attachment leaks like a sieve and broadcasts the solution horizontally most of the time, so everything gets soaking wet over a huge area. Bottom line if you need a shampooer handy, have the room to store it, and spot clean/shampoo your carpets regularly, this machine will work for you."
2,Are we using the same machine??,"This machine cleans very well. Absolutely no complaints there. But I have to keep several parts duct taped because they fall off constantly when in use. The latch on the clean water tank pops out and disengages the cleaning mechanism every couple minutes, so it's taped on. It also falls on the floor and leaks if you don't relatch it soon enough. And, the latches the hose snap into let loose all the time, causing the hose to fall on the floor. The hose is duct taped in several areas to keep it in tact. Finally, the handle on the dirty water tank comes undone and is very tricky to reattach. I eventually just threw it away. I need to replace this machine because so many parts have broken off and the tank fell out & cracked falling down my stairs, and I'm certainly not buying the same model again. I just hope other cleaners are built better than this one. Again, it cleans very well, but its construction is just not acceptable. I'm a bit baffled by the rave reviews."
5,John Richards,I used this Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner to cleam our whole house. It did a very good job with little effort. Will highly recommend.
5,Hoover Carpet Cleaner,"This is probably the most used thing in our house, not just for cleaning carpet. We use it to clean up water from aroun our indoor hot tub, works great."
1,I am steamed,"After reading the reviews, I was excited to get this Hoover SteamVac. After assembling it from a less than thorough product manual, I turned it on and it did not work. The scrubbers did not spin. While this may have been an occasional product defect, I am not so sure I will repurchase it. The parts of made of cheap plastic and I have the feeling this is not a long lasting product anyway. Let's see if Hoover and Amazon make it right."
2,Worked once =(,"Worked great the first time, tried it today 9 months later and suction does not work. Too late to return it!"
4,Good cleaner for the money,"This is a good cleaner for the money. It does not have some of the convenience features of our last Hoover, but I believe the simpler mechanisms will hold up better. I looked at the higher end (double the price) Hoover, which had a high rating in Consumer Reports, but ultimately went with this much less expensive model based on customer reviews from this and other sites.I actually found that this cleaner had good reviews at this site: ""[...]"" which summarizes reviews from multiple sites such as Amazon. Very helpful!I have cleaned two rooms of carpet and it did a good job."
4,Better than I thought it would be!,"We have one at our place of business. We use it to clean the carpeting in our showroom.Product comes partially disassembled, but, with VERY BASIC knowledge, it is fairly easy to put together. (You don't need a degree)This product does a very good job of cleaning carpet. But, as instructed, use hot water with the detergent/soap, for a deeper clean. (Hence the ""steam clean"" ability) If you have certain ""hard to clean"" stains, it would be wise to go over these stains a couple times, for the best result.I just bought one for myself....#1 because my cat just puked all over my new white carpet, and #2, I am very pleased with it's performance, and it's cleaning abilities...."
4,Works great....,"Easy too use, and does a great job.... Have used it on pretty dirty carpets and it has made them look real nice...."
4,Does the job,"I have used rented cleaners before and decided to buy the Hoover F5914-900. This machine did as good a job cleaning the carpet as the rental. It does only have a one gallon capacity, however I was not in rush to get a rental back to the store. This model is the standard one, WalMart has a similar model with a shorter power cord and no power nozzle."
4,Works great!,"Since I read reviews, I felt compelled to add my 2 cents. Worked reasonably well (for the money). There were still some areas I had to scrub with a brush, but overall it did a decent job."
4,clean carpets,"we have cream carpets, and after using steamvac they became clean even where they were stained or heavy traffic.love the removal of soapy water. have used the vac to rinse and quick drying."
4,Hoover F5914-900 Steamvac,"Nice! Always purchased Brissel....but this Hoover Steamvac was just as efficent. Did excellent job cleaning, and the attachments for cleaning carpets work!"
1,Don't buy from Hoover.com,This review is not for the Item but for the service by Hoover.com on purchase of this item.I bought the Hoover Steamvac F5914-900 recently from Hoover.com and they shipped me a broken piece. To return it they require me to pay the shipping. This is a terrible service on part of hoover.com shipping broken items to customers thinking someone would just use a broken piece instead of returning it back because of shipping charge.I would suggest everyone to keep away from Hoover.com and instead buy from Amazon which offers free returns.
1,don't buy this,"I used this 3 times, the third time it stopped vacuuming the water?! what a mess, had to run and buy a shop vac. I am stuck with it because the box was tossed, I tried it out and worked fine, so I threw the packing away. Lesson learned I should have gotten this item local, would have been able to return it."
4,Easy to use; cleans well,"The SteamVac easy to use and cleans wells, even on heavily soiled areas with the Clean Surge feature. I also found the companion Hoover Pet Plus and Hoover Professional Strength Detergents to be must-haves and very effective. The removal/reattachment of the water container is a bit fiddly, but not a show stopper."
4,good job cleaning...,did not like the way the all the hoses are stored. I understand why there are there but i find them awkward. Does a great job of sucking the water up too.. very good product...
2,It leaks,I've only used it three times and it leaks. I'm going to take it in to fix but I'm upset because it's brand new and it leaks everywhere!
3,Steanvac F5914-900,"Does the job, however. Item, purchased as new, arrived with the front scrub brushes broken (middle brush would fall out of holder, retainer missing). Then, after one use, the waste water collection reservior intake fins broke and one of two reservior retaining clips broke.To Amazon's credit they promptly paid the costs for replacement parts (parts and shipping). Their customer service is great."
4,does the job,"In order to clean carpets at my own pace, I decided to purchase a carpet cleaner after years of renting a commercial cleaner. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this cleaner easy to use, lightweight enough to move around, and that it did a good cleaning the carpets. Despite a few problems with the tools falling out of the holders while moving the machine, I would recommend this product."
2,Hoover Steam Vac,First time I used the machine I decided to clean my sofa. The upholstery attatchment stopped working after 10 minutes. Now I am going to have to take it in and have it repaired. For the price you would expect it to work longer than 10 minutes. I would not purchase this again!!!
3,carpet cleaner,"bought this cleaner and began using it the same day.....cleans very well, but the handle broke on the second day....very frustrating...was loose to begin with; feel this is a defect in the manufacturing....had to take to dealer to fix under warranty....cleans well but the handle mechanism needs improvement."
5,Performed great,"I did a lot of research and decided the Hoover F5914-900 was the best option for the price. It replaced a Bissellthat was just OK. It lasted for over 5 years, but never got the carpet quite clean enough. The Hoover does a muchbetter job, especially with the spinning brushes. The only negative is that the attachment for cleaning upholsteryis cumbersome to keep on the machine and I simply store this in the closet. Overall, great machine!"
5,Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac,"Fast delivery. Works very good. Few years ago I bought Bissell steam cleaner, it worked good, clean very well. But I like Hoover more for 2 reasons: cleaning liquid adds directly to water tank and 2d-clean water and dirty water are 2 separate tanks, more convenient. My Bissell had water heater... may be its not bad idea but after 2 cleanings create problem with heating element(I fixed it myself). Bissell was completely broken after 6 cleaning. I read some costumer review about the same problem with Hoover too and decided to buy not expensive cleaner-$150-included delivery and taxes. Even if it will work 6 times only-it's worth it-less expensive than call cleaning company or rent steam cleaner from any company.After 1st cleaning my 2 bedrooms apartment- I like it and recommend to everybody. I don't know what will happen in few cleaning :) but so far ...PS For 6 month I cleaned my carpet already 3 times (I have puppy dog :).Works perfect, I like it."
4,Easy to use. Upholstry tools work great too,"We bought this steam cleaner after a lot of researching on the web.The ad didn't say whether the upholstry tools came with it, although the main Hoover website said that it did.I was very glad the tools were part of the package.The machine worked great at getting the deep dirt and pet stains out of the carpets and refreshed our upholstry too. It was very easy to use the first time.I would recommend this machine to others."
5,Machine gets results!,"Recently bought a Hoover F5914-900 to replace my similar F5855. I got the used F5855 about ten years ago - and it has cleaned countless carpets in my rental properties with near professional results. When the older unit's extractor finally quit (after much use and abuse), I was delighted to see the same basic design was available in the F5914.The new unit appears as well made as my original. And the legendary cleaning power remains intact. I get decent results using cold tap water, but for best results I use hot, or even boiling, water. And as other reviewers have noted, pre-treatment also improves results.I hope Hoover continues to make this great line of carpet cleaners. I may need another one in ten or twelve years."
4,Great cleaner,Had a Bissell before and wasn't impressed even before it broke. This one is much easier to use and cleans much better. It isn't as good as steam cleaning but it will keep your carpet clean.
4,My 2 cents on Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac,"I just purchased this and we've been going crazy cleaning everything. It's a great product.We had some puppy stains and smells that needed to get cleaned up out of my 4 year old carpet and it worked wonderfully using the Hoover Premium Pet Detergent. On a couple of high traffic areas, I had to use it twice.I found all the parts to be functional and user-friendly. It's heavy, and I like the handy place on top of the tank for carrying. Some reviews I read complained of the plastic parts. What do you expect for $150? Even the pricey Dyson Vacuum Cleaners are plastic.I must add that I think Hoover should remove the ""Steam"" aspect of this product as there is no steam. This is misleading. However, that is my only complaint.This beats anything I've used and it certainly beats rentals!"
2,Another Hoover Toy,"Short cord, very small soap and collector tanks. Constant emptying and filling. You can clean only one portion of a standard room. Good for miniature apartments. Flimsy plastic. Will it last another year? But it wasn't defective. And it didn't break upon the first use. That's good but quite a statement about today's products. More toy-like than commercial-like."
1,No Steam!,"Don't be fooled by the name. This cleaner does NOT produce any steam. In addition, if you want to clean bare floors you must buy a blare floor attachment that you can only find out about by reading the manual. Difficult to put together, noisy and heavy. I hate it!"
4,Hoover steamvac with steam surge has neither steam or surge,"Hoover steamvac with steam surge has neither steam or surge, however the unit worked just fine. I researched this by reviewing the other reviews and comments left on this unit before buying. No surprises. I knew before hand that there was no ""steam"" feature, but I used hot water from the microwave to load the clean tank and the unit did a very good job of getting up all the stains from our pet that had been cleaned by hand over the years. I was pleased with the out come and would buy the unit again. The price was right and we'll use it more in the coming years."
5,Works great,"I bought the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900 based on other customer high ratings and the good price. The instructions and assembly were easy. I have used the Carpet Cleaner to clean the carpet in my whole house. The cleaner is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. I am very pleased with the product."
4,Can you carry a gallon of milk ???,"I can't believe how many people say that to fill or empty the reservoir it is too heavy. Come on, can you carry a gallon of milk ? If not maybe you aught to think of working out a little. NOT HEAVY AT ALL. Only reason not rated as 5 is I think the bristles are not stiff enough to give a good scrubbing."
4,Almost a homerun,"Did a great job on the carpets, as indicated by other reviews. However, mine had a defect in the accessory hose; the valve which activates the spray drips continuosly. I called the Hoover hotline and they directed me to an authorized Hoover repair shop which is a 40 mile round trip. Not convenient. I'll have to find time to solve the problem. Otherwise, I'd recommend the machine."
4,Nice for the price!,"I read all the reviews, then took the plunge. Steam Vac arrived within a couple of days, and today I used it for the first time. Although I ordered extra shampoo, it didn't come with the cleaner shipment--I only had the small bottle that came with the machine. However, I managed to clean a decent sized area, including our main hallway with it....and while I'll need to go back over a couple of high traffic areas (our carpet is cream-colored, with the last professional cleaning somewhere around last Christmas, give or take a month), it is noticeably cleaner, and some bad 'puppy spots' are gone! It takes a little getting used to watching both tanks, and once I noticed there wasn't any suction, but that was due to my not having the take up tank lid on securely--an easy fix. Overall it's easy to use and yes, lots of dirt comes up! I would have liked larger tanks--so only 4 stars--but again, it does a good job for the money. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Hoover Steamvac is a very good product.,"I've used this product one time and it is easy to use and does a good job.So far,I would recommend it,especially to pet owners."
4,Honest review...,"This cleaner is pretty much as advertised. Easy to set up and use, does a descent job of cleaning. Good value for the money."
4,Good cleaning results,After renting several times decided to purchase a carpet cleaner. This one is easy to use and cleans carpets as well as any rental I've used in the past. My favorite feature is the hand held stair and spot cleaner. The brushes cleaned very dirty carpet on the steps that I was going to replace. No need to now. Definitely a good product for an excellent price.
4,Better than Stanley Steamer!,"After much searching on the internet, I saw that this shampooer rated wonderfully.I found it at Best Buy (11/27/2011) for $99, with a $10 gift certificate to use in the store.I was uncertain when I opened the box, as it seemed a bit 'flimsy'.However, after using it all evening on all kinds of carpets and area rugs, I can honestly say that this is the BEST shampooer I have ever used!The suction is wonderful and my carpets have NEVER looked better.Best of all, is it leaves your rugs and carpets SO dry!I love the display on the top of the machine that shows how much water it is sucking up. Therefore, I can go over it again.My only problem (which is my own fault) is that if you don't attach the tanks securely, it will not work.I highly recommend this product and would not hesitate to buy another."
5,Just what we wanted,"Great steam cleaner, a great thing to have with a toddler and a dog in the same house! Works great, gets the dirt out! Easy to use. Just wish it were a little less awkward to clean out when you're through..."
3,Defective Product,"After reading multiple reviews about this product leaking, I bought it anyways. There were simple facts about assembly that people shared that would make sure the product wouldn't leak. So I figured I would just make sure that I followed the directions to a tee. Which I did. The product does not leak, yeah for me, but it still doesn't work properly. The trigger on the handle gets stuck in and has to be pulled out manually. What a pain and a waste of water and solution. The attachments work great, however. I called Hoover and they told me to take it to one of their licensed repairmen. I do not have time to cart the thing around, and the closest one to me isn't exactly close. I just decided I will keep it and deal with it, but I will never buy it again. Once it's done, I'm switching brands."
4,Works well,"The machine works well, and was easy to set up. I think they could use some more support inside the box, as the product arrived damaged. The blue top housing was cracked at the side. It looks to be just a cover. I think i can make a simple repair on my own. I still used the cleaner and it seemed to work fine. Tanks are a little small, but what can you expect from a home carpet cleaner that only cost us 70.00 dollars !!"
1,"Brushes don't spin, right out of box.","Right out of the box the brushes didn't spin, possibly due to a broken turbine, which according to customer service could be due to something happening during shipping. Apparently the turbines are 'very fragile'. Because we messed around trying new things rather than immediatly returning it, we missed the 30 day replacement window and so can not return it to amazon. Now the only thing to do is send it to a service center which will take ~4-6 weeks just for 'evaluation' before they even go about fixing it. I should have trusted the unfavorable reviews from folks with similar issues. I read them but hoped i wouldn't be one of the unlucky ones. booo. I'm disappointed."
5,Love this steam cleaner,"I had an old model of the Hoover steam cleaner. It worked well for me over the past 15 years so I decided to try the updated version of it when the old Hoover developed a problem. The pickup tank, which was made of plastic and looked a lot like the updated tank, fatigued and broke so it would not lock down. The new Hoover works like a dream.I read the reviews and particularly the * reviews. I took note of the complaints that the new Hoover leaked water and someone said it was because you had to follow the assembly instructions so that you heard a LOUD snap. I never heard the loud snap and was concerned it would leak. I called the Hoover tech line and learned that they had corrected that problem. My steam cleaner does NOT leak and it works like a dream!"
3,Broke after first use,"The SteamVac cleaned the carpet very nicely and was pleased with the results upon first use. I attempted to use the it a second time a week later, and discovered the brushes would not spin. I followed the manual and cleaned the filter, and checked to make sure the brushes were properly inserted, but they still would not spin. I took it up to our local Hoover authorized repair shop and was told that the turbine that spins the brushes was broke and needed to be repaired. I now have to wait 2-3 weeks for warranty verification, parts, and install time."
5,great cleaner,"i bought tht cleaner to clean my upholstery b/c it was very dirty ,i have two kids under two and they love to make all kinds of mess ,we were not very optimistic tht this will clean our couch but the result turned out great not a single stain or speck after cleaning better than professional cleaning ,i highly recommend this product specially in a kids household."
4,Great value,"I bought this steamer because I needed to clean my house and my parent's house (where the carpets have not been cleaned for many years). I love the convenience of being able to do one room at a time without having to repeatedly go to the store to rent a unit and it is much more cost-effective.The cleaner requires some simple assembly when it arrives and there is a little bit of reconfiguration of hoses that you have to do to use the hand tool, but the instructions are very easy to follow.This cleaner is very easy to use. I do agree with the other comments that you need to go slowly to do a really thorough job - especially if the carpet has not been cleaned for some time. However, it works very well when used properly. Every time I have emptied the recovery bucket the water is just black. I had no idea a carpet that looks okay could hide so much dirt. I would absolutely recommend this item to anyone."
3,Average Product,"I had a Bissell Proheat 2x (from Costco) for about 4 years. It was heavier and pricier but it did the job well until it just stopped working one fine day. This time, I chose to purchase the Hoover instead. Hoover is comparatively cheaper and lighter. In terms of cleaning the carpet, I think Bissell does a 10-20% better job. Also, after just 3 cleanings, a small light plastic component which helps to keep the cleaner upright has just broken off the machine. That definitely makes me wonder about the durability of the Hoover product. I am now considering returning / exchanging this product. Overall, Hoover is a light and affordable tool. If you want more muscle and performance, Bissell seems to be a better option."
4,Great except for the brushes wouldnt spin out of the box,"So, I ordered this vac, and it showed up the next day. I was amazed since I used super saver shipping. Then I put it together, plugged it in, and started cleaning. I must say, with the cleaning solution and the vac, it did work well. However, I started to notice streaks, and I looked further. It turns out that the brushes were not spinning. I called Hoover, and it is is getting fixed for free. Not a big deal, just very inconvenient. Ive hired professional cleaners before to clean my carpet and they could not get the stains out that this vac could without working brushes even. It works great, and leaves the carpet almost dry. If it wasnt for the DOA part, id be blown away. By the way, the repair company said this issue with the brushes is a high fail item, and it is very common. If your vac is not under warranty, it will cost more to fix it than buy another vac."
4,Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner F5914-900,"I found this product to be fairly easy to use and it did a top notch job of cleaning my soiled carpets. The only drawback was that it was not able to cover a very large area of the carpet because the tank capacities were on the small side. Of course this made the unit smaller, lighter and easier to manuver so it also was a plus."
4,Great machine for pet owners,I used my new Hoover Carpet Cleaner on my living room rug to get rid of several pet stains. Works great and the surge button was great for extra stained areas to give that boost of cleaner. I also found that if you go over the rug thoroughly when done cleaning just using the suction the rug was only slightly damp when I was done. In addition I found it very easy to clean up when I was finished. The only thing that I would like to see improved is the size of the tank. I did have to refill the cleaner and empty the dirty tank half way through doing the living room.
5,Hoover steamvac is awesome!,"I love my new Hoover Steamvac. It made the carpet look fantastic, was easy to put together, and easy to use!"
4,Great Cleaner for the price,"I bought this cleaner because of its low price and its reviews. I am pretty happy with the results it gets, thought I wish it had some bigger tanks. It takes about 3 or 4 tanks of water to fully clean a medium sized room. The attachments are great and work quite well. The unit doesn't heat the water for you, and the water tends to cool down pretty quickly, so you have to be quick about cleaning before the water cools down. Overall, I give this cleaner a 4/5 because its price more than makes up for some of its downsides."
2,The thing cleans well but stopped the suction before job done!,"Simply. Advertized as new here,but it came with dryed dirt within the tank and other areas. Should have returned it then!Gave it a chance.It performed well (and I was fortunate) because the last three feet of the final clean water section process it quit on me. Hands & knees with a couple of towels to dry the area somewhat but at least the carpet came clean.From previous reviews online I surmised a good 'bang for the $' cleaner. And it is IF you get one w/o defects.Returned item to Amazon...we'll see how that goes :)."
1,Steam?????,"The name of this product is very misleading. The only way that I get water even close to warm is to microwave my water before putting it in the canister. Unfortunately I looked only at the graph showing the review stars and did not read the reviews. Also, the machine is touted as doing hard floor services as well as carpets. I bought the ""steam"" vac in order to steam clean my tiled floors and find that I have to purchase a hard floor attachment in order to do this. I'm searching Amazon right now for that attachment, but have given up and am writing this review since I cannot find the attachment."
1,Dissatisfied,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! All the reviews I have read seem to agree with my experiences. When it works, it really cleans the carpets. Unfortunately this design is horribly flawed and poorly constructed that it will not last. The hand-tool is an absolute disaster unless you enjoy spraying a yard-sale of soapy water and then watching your scrub brushes (driven by an air motor) chug at 5 rpm over the area. The vac itself was difficult to clean and maintain, and the air motor driving the scrub brushes conked out on mine at the 2 year mark. The nearest service center is about 5 light-years away and I can only imagine what it will cost to insert another shoddy part into the machine to give me another 2 years out of it. Use a rental next time."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have owned numerous predecesors of the Hoover SteamVac and have always been pleased. The last one lived a ripe old age but finally gave up the ghost. I immediately purchased the new model from Amazon. While putting it together I noticed the plastic ridges on the handle were very, very sharp. Well, what the heck, I'll take a file and file it down so I can hold onto it. I did file it but still it has sharp edges. Finally, two days ago, I decided to actually use it and clean my carpet. I have never said so many nasty words in one day in my life. The dirty water receiver is EXACTLY like in my former machine BUT on the new machine it is soooo difficult to get it to latch correctly so you can pick up the dirty water. I thought I had it latched correctly, would put it back on, try to pick up water and have to start all over again. Usually cleaning my carpet takes an hour. This machine doubled my time by the time I spent fighting with the dirty water receiver. I am very disappointed."
4,This is a good product!!,"For the price, the Hoover certainly does its job. It is an easy to use equipment and has great suction. Does a fine job cleaning the carpet and leaves it pretty dry."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Pieces are made cheaply!! I used this product one time and center spinning brush on the 5 brush block broke. All of these brushes must work properly for any of them to work, and this is the main scrubbing piece of the upright machine.BRUSHES ARE NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY!!!It's about $30 to replace that piece alone.More cons.. I don't like how the hose attachment connects. There's a lot of leaking, it's a mess to switch over, and it's just not a good system for switching between upright and hose.The pros in my case.. I do like how the carpet felt pretty dry after cleaning, the stair cleaning brush attachment/hose works pretty well.And Hoover does have really great customer service.All in all, I would have chosen a different product for the price. And I would have purchased at a local store where returns would have been easier with such a quick break on a main piece."
4,Works great!,"We used to rent the big ones from the grocery store and finally decided that with three kids and a dog we would buy our own. It was easy to assemble and fill. It does have a smaller water unit that has to be refilled often but that's fine by me b/c I can lift it up and down my stairs easily. I have cleaned every room in my house and it did a great job- lots of black water which is so gross. There were tough statins that I sprayed with a water/vinegar solution and that helped. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Consumer Best Buy,"Even though Consumer Best Buy magazine has never reviewed carpet steam cleaners (not sure why), this one is sure to get a best buy approval. I just cleaned our first room (12X14) and it did an excellent job taking the dirt out. The machine is simple to use and I hope it provides many years of continued service. Even though everything is plastic I would say it does what it says it will do as long as you follow the simple directions."
2,Hoover does not stand by their 1 year warranty.,In fairness to Hoover their SteamVac Carpet Cleaner works well if you follow their directions. What I did not expect was to find out the weight of the machine relies on a very small piece of plastic to disengage the foot locking peddle. The second time that I used mySteamVac the weight of the machine snapped off the plastic stop that is part of the body of the unit. Hoover asked for a photograph which was provided and they said they would not honor that broken part as part of the warranty. They gave me a phone number to contact an outside repair facility to purchase a new main body for the cleaner. The part is not available on the Hoover web site. The weight of the machine when it is loaded with the liquid cleaner is considerably more than the part that locks the handle in the upright position. Bottom line be VERY carful when you use the cleaner so as not to put pressure on that small part.
1,surprise,"brush does not spin after 2 washes, had to take to repair shop. I just hope it will be coverd by the warranty. Ok warranty covered repair but it took them 2 months to fix it."
3,Fairly decent machine,"Not a bad machine but you use a lot of expensive detergent. Many trips to the sink to empty the recovery tank. If you have an especially dirty rug, you will have to clean it at least twice, hence more detergent. Soap does not dispense evenly. Runs out of detergent fairly quickly. No steam as mentioned on other reviews.Tip: Move the machine slowly across the rug - cleans better. Push forward and pull backwards. Wheels have a tendency to leave soap streaks."
2,Not worth it,"Couldn't get the hand tools to work. Power switch is broken after using this 6-7 times. Ok at cleaning, but tough spots I usually have to do more than once. Compared to my last Hoover steam vac, not as good."
1,Made in China,"Bought one, broke, it would not dispense the solution after a few uses. Bought another one and the brush fell out after a few uses. I would not buy another one. Better to spend some extra money for a quality machine. Don't have any recomendations, but don't buy this machine."
1,Major problem with new unit,"I wish I could give Hoover zero stars on this.I bought this new, and immediately had the major leaking problem a lot of people have mentioned. But mine was not related to priming the surge button, installation or anything simple like that.Mine had a crack in the reservoir regulator and that had to be replaced.Beyond that being an unreasonable hassle on a brand new machine, the closest Hoover Service Center is 45 miles away so instead of making two trips there I had to choose to pay my local repair shop to diagnose the problem and repair it. So that cost me an extra $28 AND I did not have my steam cleaner for 2-3 weeks right after I bought it.Hoover needs better quality control and more service centers.A new machine should not have a crack in it, and a new machine should not leak profusely the first time you use it."
2,misnamed,it does not use steam so i sent it back. should be illegal to give something a name that it doesn't do. probably a good carpet cleaner but we already have one. i would also like to commend amazon for the ease of sending the item back and subsequent credit on my credit card. thanks!
4,Love this steam cleaner,I have had this steam cleaner for over a year and I still love it. It does a great job of cleaning up the carpets and it is easy to use.
4,Hoover Steam Cleaner,Item worked great. Be sure to snap in place the part mentioned on page 4 so it doesn't leak out the bottom. Left the carpet clean and like new.
5,A GREAT CLEANING MACHINE,The Hoover Carpet Cleaner came highly recommended by Consumers Reports. And it lived up to my expectations. I have a back problem. I needed a lightweight and easy to use machine. It also had to be very effective. This machine was everything I needed. And Amazon offered the best price with free shipping!
4,950 Sq Ft apartment; 2 people; Light Carpet; 1 dog,"Cleaner works very well. I was skeptical because of the cost, but it has proven to be one of the better household purchases I've made in the last year. The size is just about right, not enormous but not dainty, and I've had no trouble with the weight or maneuvering it around. I did experience the same suction problem other people have mentioned in reviews, but like those were as a result of not securing the used water tank properly and is always a simple fix. Not a big fan of the hose extension (there is too far of a gap between the water dispenser and suction to effortlessly do stairs), but the actual machine and results are pretty amazing."
4,Pays for itself,"Unfortunately, I got a lot of light rugs where I live so the rugs really show a lot of dirt.I used to pay someone to come in and do it and some cleaning companies get themselves in the door at a competiitve price and then try to upcharge you saying that it is too dirty for the advertised price.I got sick of dealing with that and bought this cleaner.It works almost as well as the pro's but takes a bit longer but that is okay, I still am happy to save the money and it will pay for itself over time."
1,Not worth the money.,I owned this product for 6 months when it stopped working. The suction completely stopped and the brushes would no longer spin as the tiny little plastic piece that turns all four brushes broke in half. Very disappointed!
4,Good steam vac for the price.,"Everything is great except for when I use it on my high pile carpet. It is really difficult to push forward. I end up just having to do two pull back strokes. If I had to do it different, I would have gotten an automatic drive."
4,Hoover Steam Vac,"I previously had a Hoover Steam/Vac for quite a number of years and liked it. It slowly fell apart, but now my son is using it. This new one is slightly improved, but a little harder to undo to clean. But it works great and I love it. Glad I now only have 3 rooms of carpet to clean. I hated doing stairs! But I recently used it and it brought my new carpet just about back to brand new again...and that's after almost a year! I really like the clean surge and it does take back quite a bit of the water in the carpet."
1,leaking tank,"I loved our first Hoover Sucker-upper (Steamvac). We had a couple of puppies and it saved our rugs. We used it for about 5 years before it died. After a couple of years we replaced it with the newer version. I was delighted with the clear water/soap dispenser system and it did a wonderful job of cleaning our carpets. I haven't used it for a year (most of our floors are now hardwood), but now the tank drains without even squeezing the trigger. I'm so disappointed. Now what!?"
1,Absolute Cheap Crap,"I have no idea why this has so many positive reviews. The suction completely crapped out on me and my living room is a sopping mess. I am going to return. Also, you have to changed the water every 5 feet! This is an absoute no go and the 2000 positive reviews I swear are Hoover employees or folks who do not know quality products like a Miele or a Dyson."
5,LOVE this shampoo vac!,I wore out a $300 bissel that I really liked. I bought this one for $100 refurbished. OMGOODNESS!! I can't say enough. The product design is MUCH easier than the bissel. I have two BIG dogs and a slew of cats on a ranch. It does a great job with the hair. Outstanding product.
4,Love this carpet cleaner,Amazing carpet cleaner. Super easy to set up and use. My carpets were quite dirty and they looked SPOTLESS after using this product. I wish I had bought one sooner instead of paying someone to clean my carpets. Love it.
1,It does leak and I couldn't fix it.,"I saw someone on here who said it leaks and it's an easy fix. First of all, bull. It's brand new and I shouldn't HAVE to fix it. Right after I put the tank on, water was everywhere. Tried fixing it but couldn't. My Mom fell and hurt herself really bad on Thanksgiving b/c of this thing soaking the floor. Amazon took it back and I bought a Bissell. Much better!"
3,Great for carpets! Not good for stairs/upholstery,"This cleaner worked great for the carpets. I saw it pick up sand, dirt and hair! My carpets looked great and the suction is very good. The carpets dried quickly. However, I broke off a clip that holds the dirty water tank in place without even realizing it. Then the other clip just started popping off!!!! Also, I tried to use the hose with a carpet tool to clean the stairs and the small plastic tube popped off the hose/upholstery connector like a wine cork each time I tried to use it. Water shot all over the place until I was able to turn off the machine or get the hose back on the connector piece. After three times of that I just gave up! I intend on calling the company to find out if I am doing something wrong! I would purchase this item from Amazon. Walmart has this cleaner, but I found it cheaper here and it did look a bit different than the one Amazon sent me."
4,Does a great job!,Amazon replaced the first one that arrived damaged and I was very pleased with the service especially right around Christmas.Haven't tried any of the add on features but basic function is getting lots of plain dirt out of carpet that has not been cleaned in ten years. My sister saw it when she visited at Christmas and went home and bought one for herself.Even basic instructions could be much better and assembly had me guessing what they meant..........
5,great product,"This is great for what you pay. Disadvantages: heavy, hard to put all the hoses where they go, hard to hook up the extra attachment/hose for cleaning steps, etc... Plus: I went on a cleaning spree once this arrived; I even shampooed the carpet in my suv...pretty good product. Have fun lugging it up steps (yes, empty and without water), but for what you pay, it is great. I love that you can see your nasty water getting sucked up as you clean; this really motivates you to clean until it runs ""clear""....Carpet is NOT left sopping wet. Overall, I would recommend this!!"
5,Hoover SteamVac number 1 for me,I have had the Hoover SteamVac for a few weeks. And yesterday I finally put it together. It was a simple task to put the pieces together. Then I tried it on my carpet for the first time. I am actually quite surprised at how clean my carpet was after only one use. I also liked that the Vac felt sturdy. I have had products in the past that felt cheaply made and would fall apart. The Hoover SteamVac feels sturdy and I am sure I will be using for many years to come. And as I have shared my experience with the Hoover SteamVac...well of course I am getting requests to borrow it. I will be taking it to my Moms' and doing her carpet soon.So overall I am very pleased with this Product. Ordering was easy and I am a happy camper to have my Carpet.....Spic n Span...LOL
3,A good clean but poor quality on the build,"Ok so i researched this unit high and low before I finally purchased I really did my homework. This little unit absolutely will extract a ton of water, so well in fact the carpet dries very quickly. The rotating brushes do a fairly good job but the bristles are entirely to soft for a good scrubbing. The fresh water tank is very easy to fill and the dirty water is very easy to clean. The tanks could be much bigger they run out very fast. The hand tool is very nice and has a good scrubber. Now the bad part after the first day the locking clip that holds the unit upright when not in use broke and the unit would constantly fall over with water in the tanks and it will leak when that happens. I looked and the locking clip that broke and it's a very weak piece of plastic. I was forced to return the unit for this but I will most likely repurchase another."
3,Pro's & Con's,"This is a value carpet extractor but be aware of a few issues.Pro’s:The solution and dirty water reservoir are separate and bigger then a Bissell bladder.After extracting the water from the carpet, the carpet seems much dryer then my previous Bissell pro-heat.It’s heavy but seems easy to push and pull when cleaning.Cons:The handheld solution hose needs to be manually connectedThe bottom tank can be a little bit of a pain to remove and empty.Some of the movable parts seem flimsy, although I haven’t had an issue yetIts loud and heavy if you have many of stairsSometimes it leaks after useIt doesn’t heat the water like the Bissell pro-heat."
4,Very handy,"This machine is very handy for quick cleanup of dog messes and spills. It is not as good as the rug doctor that you rent at the grocery store, but I am happy so far. It was handy for sucking up water out of my rug and off the floor when a pipe burst under the kitchen sink. It did ok on the foyer rug, which gets very dirty from traffic, but again I'm comparing it to the rug doctor which removed almost all the dirt with one cleaning."
4,Good for Area Rugs,"I bought this SteamVac only to clean area rugs. One is very shaggy and the other is not. It worked very well on both rugs. I did have trouble with it at one point because if it's not put back together correctly after filling the water it won't suck the water. Other than that, it certainly met my expecations and did a good job cleaning the rugs. I haven't used the upholstery feature yet."
4,Cleans well,I have used this Hoover SteamVac twice now with very good results. It is easy to assemble and easy to use. I used it to clean my tile floor also. I am pleased with the results. Too bad it doesn't heat the water as it cleans.
5,Love My clean Carpets,"I purchased this because I have always had success with Hoover products.I have back and joint pain and needed something light enough for me to handle yet powerful enough to get the job done.I love it,my carpet has never looked better,I have a Black Lab that lets me live in his house so I was impressed with the ease of getting rid of the dog hair problem. (My lab does let me vacumn him daily also). I would recommend this product to anyone. Easy to setup Easy to use. Does a great job for the price."
1,Major Dissapointment,"The product is cheap cheap cheap. It's also bulky. I used it once after my purchase sometime in May/June of 2012. I used it again in November, or tried to use it, and it won't suck up the water. It completely soaked my carpet. I watched all the troubleshooting YouTube videos, and did a lot of research on line, but I can't fix it. Unfortunately the warranty expired a month from date of purchase.I'm going back to my reliable spot bot, but it's not a great tool for a large space."
4,Great on carpets!! Be careful on wood floors,"I purchased this product to replace the Hoover Floormate that I had for several years. I figured a carpet and hardwood floor cleaner together would be an awesome bonus.I loved it for the carpet. It is well designed and easy to use.I purchased the attachment for hardwood floors which is useless unless you want to use it to protect the floors during transport. The attachment lifts it up off the floor a bit too much decreasing its ability to suck up the water.It will scratch wood floors without the attachment, but if you are careful and make sure the floors are free of dirt and sand and don't mind small scratches ( I have dogs so my floor is covered with scratches) it actually cleans better than the Floormate."
5,Freddie at his best!,We loved this DVD. Freddie was always a revelation and this was not exception. Send for it today and you won't be sorry.
5,The Great Pretender Video,"Freddie Mercury The Great Pretender. Great all the way through,a fantastic performer, he made Queen, there will never be another like him"
2,Not great,"Much more could have been done with this. Disappointing. It was more like a really long advertisement for the rerelease of Barcelona. Focused mostly on Freddie acting arogant, which true fans know he wasn't. Made my husband that knew nothing about Freddie get the picture that Freddie was extremely talented but a jerk that didn't respect his bandmates. I expected much more from this after seeing the great ""Days of our Lives"" Blue-ray. Seems liked they tried to an extreme to seperate Queen from this documentary without sharing much about Freddie."
3,mixed bag,"A number of the articles (particularly those by Dr. Friedman) and much of the information in this book provide a useful introduction to how various navies changed and adapted during the Cold War. However, the information provided on Soviet Naval plans is dated and often inaccurate. In other words, it can be inadequate or unreliable and was superseded by later sources. That being said the book is otherwise enlightening."
2,Not very happy,"Most of my warship books devote a page or so to each class and, in that page, have a photo plus line drawing of the vessel. The page also includes a table of dimensions, armament, machinery etc. This is very handy for reference purposes.This book, however, is a very general one and while there is an index at the back of each chapter, I found it very annoying. For example, when I wanted details of AEGIS / Arleigh Burke ships there was no set place to go to.While the contents were interesting I found the book to be disappointing as a whole.Jim Harmon"
4,Old school horror movie soundtrack!!,This soundtrack is one of the highlights of my memories as a teenager in the 80's. I truly enjoyed all of the songs from the film. A great great record. Get it.
5,Best soundtrack,"Just a short review reinforce what others have already said - this is the best soundtrack I've ever bought, and one of my favorite albums period. Cry Little Sister is the most unique, I love Lost in the Shadows and I Still Believe... but I like pretty much every song on the album (yeah the last 1 minute of carnival music is it's own thing but hey)."
4,Artists names wrong!,"As of 12/10/2008, almost every artist name is incorrect in the track listing. Fortunately, the reviewers are more ""on it"" than whoever put the original listing together."
3,"A few great songs, a few duds","This soundtrack has a few great songs, but also a few duds. So, keep that in mind when purchasing."
4,One of the best soundtracks....,Great music and I liked almost every track. I saw the film and loved the music and I went out and bought it. Excellent rock/pop music...
4,Great!,"I bought this for my niece who loves the movie ""The Lost Boys"" she also loves the music. Now she can listen to the music without having to put on the movie."
5,Experiencing the Heart of God,"M.R. Dehaan, in this M.R. DeHaan Classic Library Series, touches the human heart with the the pure, straight-forward and undiluted truth of God's Word as few writers can. In this study from the Book of Ruth, the wonderfully rich application of this Old Testament classic story to the Christian's new life in Christ, the ""Kinsman Redeemer"", is wonderfully depicted. This book is strongly recommended for those blievers in search of a deeper, truer, more intimate walk with Jesus."
5,Fascinating reading,"As a little girl I rode the Strasburg railroad in Pennsylvania. When I saw this book at the store, it brought back happy memories, so I decided to buy the book. I found the information to be very interesting. I was amazed that there were so many other railroads in my state. The information was very well written. This book offers a great insight into a fascinating subject."
5,A truly blissful journey!,"This book took me through a blissful journey over the life of H.H. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Capturing the life of an enlightened Master is, I think, is one of the most difficult tasks and I must say that the author has done justice to it. There are a very fortunate few who got to see the Master's life intimately, specially the days of His childhood and youth. For the others, the book is truly a blessing! I could not keep it aside till finishing it. A MUST READ!!!!!"
2,lame attempt at a biography,"Let me start off with stating that I did not finish this book. I read the first several chapters and I just couldn't finish it. It was all fluff. Don't get me wrong. I am well disposed to like this book, for I find Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to be an amazingly interesting person. I have known him personally and have been intrigued and greatly inspired by him. But this book misses the mark. It reads like one long PR piece. It offers no real insight into who Sri Sri is. It just gushes like an infatuated teenager. I was greatly disappointed."
2,Guru of Joy,I am heavily into spiritual living. I did not enjoy this book and would not recommend others to read it. This is just my opinion though. Others may disagree.
2,Sugarcoating to the end,"A book that started of by making me nauseous, its very sugary and seems a bit brainwashed. The more I read the less negativity I felt, I remembered how it is in India, how people trust their guru without any criticism, and I even wanted to go to Bangalore to try out The Art of Living course. But after sending two emails asking for the price and other questions about accomodation and getting back very vague answers I gave up, for now at least. Maybe I will give it a try some day again, but this book is unfortunately not anything I recommend to anyone, only good thing about it was the price."
3,What's Wrong with the TNIV,"While I agree with the objective of this book, it really should have had another title. ""What's wrong with the TNIV"" (Today's New International Version) would have been far more accurate. The opening pages only deal with translation issues in general -- the rest of the book gives an abundance of reasons why the TNIV is not faithful to the ancient manuscripts and should be avoided. The focal point of the authors' concern over the TNIV is the ""gender inclusive"" language present. While the TNIV is not the only translation to use such language, it is perhaps the most prominent one due to its ties with the extremely popular NIV (New International Version). If you want a book on what's wrong with the TNIV, buy this title. If you want a book on Bible translations in general, look elsewhere."
4,very funny,"Dirty Deeds definitely falls into the catagory of movies that are just flat out amusement. it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a good laugh. It obviously falls into the teen comedy genre, with like American Pie and Road Trip style movies.It's got Milo Ventimiglia from Gilmore Girls in it, and for most girls that's enough reason to watch it, at least once. He's definitely not his Gilmore Girls character. He plays a geeky type, but totally lovable as he tries to complete the 10 Dirty Deeds in twelve hours! It's completely nuts and turns into a wild night.If you like hilarious teen comedy's, you'll love this movie."
2,Every Actor's Got To Start Somewhere,"Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, ""this is idiotic"", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right?"
3,Dirty Deeds,Typical teen movie. Kindof cheesy in parts and there's alot of outrageousness that you would not normally see in real-life. However it was entertaining and you pretty much get what you expect.
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","In my copy of the rated version, there's about a ten or fifteen second period in which there is no audio (dead silence) in the surround sound track. The sound was fine on the two-channel track. I thought for a moment my Blu-Ray player might have a firmware bug, but I pulled the disc and tried it in my laptop with identical results.Given that the playback did not stutter in any way (and my computer's DVD drive didn't show any bad block errors), I suspect that this is not just a single bad disc, but rather an bad pressing run. I'd be curious if anyone has a copy of the rated version in which the surround sound actually works.The moral of the story is that if you want surround sound, buy the *unrated* version."
2,dirty deeds indeed,watching this film i felt i had seen it before . it follows the same teen movie cleshays that we know so well offering nothing new for this type of movie . saying that i've seen worse and fans of teen comedys will probable find it entertaining for the most part . the main reason i got this was that the talented Lacey Chabert is in it . acting in the type of film that she made fun of in not another teen movie . lacey does her best with the material and what little screen time she has but she is not aloud to show her true comic potenshal as she was in films like mean girls .in my opinion this film is not bad it's just very avarge .thank you for reading my review .
4,kept me laughing throughout,"I must agree with the other reviewers. Dirty Deeds is a fun filled comedy that reminded me of movies such as Can't Hardly Wait and National Lampoon's Van Wilder. Some of the ""deeds"" they came up with were hilarious. This movie has a great cast of upcoming actors. Lacy Chabert and Milo Ventimiglia do a great job carrying the movie and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them in the future.Great looking cast! Lacy Chabert is especially nice to watch. It is definately one of those films in your collection that you can watch again and again."
2,"Wow, what a disappointment.","Let me start by saying I own at least a dozen (if not more) Michelin Green Guides. This was a real let down. The organization was terrible. For example, the book is supposed to be in alphabetical order but some places are listed under their own name i.e. Louvre and others are listed under their location - NOT ARONDISSMENT- i.e. St. Germain. This makes it extremely confusing to figure out where to find the monument, museum, etc. that you're trying to visit.Also, the index at the back is completely useless. Some places are entered in French alphabetical order and some in English. A lot of places don't even appear in the index at all. This is especially annoying since the main section of the book is so disorganized.I guess this is really a 3 star book when you compare it to others but it really doesn't live up to Michelin standards. I will still buy other versions for other locations but I suggest you skip this one."
5,Great Bag!,"Excellant bag. Extremely tough and durable. Well made. Fits my freediving fins, snorkel, mask, freediving suit and accessories easily. Absolutely no issues with this purchase."
2,Disappointing. This is NOT written by Ernest Matthew Mickler,"Same cover and look as previous White Trash Cooking books, but not written by Ernest Matthew Mickler. With Ernest's untimely passing, cousin Trisha attempts to pick up the pen and cookin' legacy of Mr. Mickler. She, unfortunately for us, fails. Filled with short, uninviting recipes, this cookbook does not have the same zing or endearing writing flair that her cousin so easily wrought. Skip this one altogether and stick with the original two by Ernest: White Trash Cooking and White Trash Cooking II, Recipes for Gathern's."
5,German1 - THIS IS TWO CD'S - YOU GOTTA GET IT!,"TWO CD SET! MAGNIFICENT! THIS IS THE ""TANGLEWOOD-STYLE"" FESTIVALCHOIR & ORCHESTRA-TYPE SOUND YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FROM GERMANY! Professional, SUPER CRISP, CLEAR STEREO (NEW) recording of choral, solo and instrumental music from Germany!!!! This belongs alongside your Cincinnati and Boston Pops collection! Range is from fast, moving recognizable traditional German hymns to children's choir (akin to Vienna boy's choir and other pros) to a multiharmonic (!EXCELLENT!)large choir, to fast, fun (professional) sing alongs! I REALLY don't know why it's so inexpensive but it is a STEAL at the price... TWO FULL CD'S! You will NOT be disappointed in this FIRST CLASS, NEW and easy listening, professional recording!!! *Not* a ""Tanglewood"" recording but close... watch out Pops !!!"
4,Excellent Discussion of the Working Poor,"Newman crafts an exceptional portrait of the working poor in urban America. The main strength of the book is the way it ties the plight of the working poor to the current policy debate. Particularly, the role of wefare reform in American cities. Although she writes before many changes in the social welfare system, she is able to identify issues that are now key. Unfortunately, some of her policy recommendations are not well suited for the setting that she describes. For instance, the recommendation to create employment cooperatives between primary and secondary sector employers seems underdeveloped, and somewhat inpractical. But, this does not detract from the thrust of the work, which identified employment as a central concern in poor communities. This argument represents the end of a long ugly discussion of social pathology in the inner city, and the start of a more productive discussion of poverty as a problem in mainstream America."
4,very well put together,"i don't know how anyone can trip on people earning a living period. if you are working then you are working period, makes no difference. taking care of yourself, family,etc.. is to be applauded not looked down upon. this book deals with the social haves and have nots. all jobs in the work force require sacrifice and some more so than others and this book touches on that and of course racial. i really enjoyed reading this book and i feel more people outta check into it. everybody is trying to make it and in these days and times its all very real to the eyes."
2,"A bit dry, but informative&#65533;","I was actually assigned to read this book for my Introduction to Sociology class. While I might not have picked it up on my own, I found that it wasn't that bad. Newman tells us stories of the working poor in Harlem, many who work at the local ""Burger Barn"". Their struggles do really grip you and give you a different picture of these people. While a couple of chapters were a little bogged down in numbers, and Newman assumes her readers are familiar with some aspects of welfare and such, overall, the book was an interesting look into how people try to ""make it"", that is easily accessible to most."
2,A Huge Dissapointment,"I picked up this book happy to read that someone had the courage to tackle the issues of the working poor. Sadly, this book misses and misses dreadfully. Ms. Newman spent years of research and it comes across that she sat in her academic office and never had the guts to go into the neighberhoods she represents in her book. She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior. If her so called Burger Barn cut some of it's profits and gave it to the workers, just think you'd have happy encouraged workers and billionaires who maybe can't buy a new plane that year."
1,sloppy abbreviated excerpts from other vault guides with no MBA specific focus,THis guide is comprised of disjointed industry snapshots taken from other vault industry guides with no specific advice for MBA job seekers whatsoever. It's a complete waste of money and the Vault people should be ashamed of themselves for attaching their name to such a shoddy product.Not to mention it's full of typos and grammatical errors
2,Shallow,This book doesn't give much detail and doesn't cover nuances associated with many careers. It fails to provide any income stats and does not talk about a lot of upcoming careers and industries. Whatever it covers is also very generic and shallow. I certainly didn't find it very helpful to provide answers to the career questions I had. I found the MBA forums at businessweek.com more helpful. It may also help to read blogs etc. on the internet or pose the questions on linkedin discussion forums.
2,"If you buy this book, buy a used copy at a reasonable price!","I bought this book because I am currently pursuing an MBA. I wanted some fresh ideas about other ways I could use my degree. This book wasn't helpful at all. There was nothing ground-breaking in this ""bible"". Most of the information was info that I already knew or information that could easily be obtained by a simple google search on MBA's. I was looking for a lot more details, such as using your undergrad degree with the MBA to explore other avenues. This book was pretty generic. Maybe the newer version of the book is more helpful, but I wouldn't buy another one to find out. I gave it two stars because I did get a good deal on the book, I bought it used in excellent condition and it came in a timely manner. And also, I gave it two stars because I did buy the 2008 edition, so the info could just be outdated!"
4,Great spy read!,"I've not read a lot of spy novels, and I've only read a handful of Ken Follett's novels so i only gave this 4 stars. I thought this was well written and a great story about WWII. I loved the ending!"
3,inaccurate description,Description stated no highlighting inside but many pages contained highlightings as well as underlines.Overall look is okay but I wished that I was informed beforehand that the book was marked by highlighting since I wanted to order a book with no highlighting inside
3,"Multicultural Requirement for Teacher Credential Program, CA","Book is a collection of narratives from perspectives of each diverse group. Not a joy to read, but not bad for a college text either. Personally I would much rather read short narratives than long and boring texts.However, the multicultural agenda is really what this is book is all about. Some readings are offensive; generalities are made and stir some controversy in and out of the classroom.I rated it 3 stars because it is not as bad as most multicultural texts from other classes."
1,This book is a joke...,"...Especially the section about homosexuality. I've never seen someone waste so much time twisting and/or ignoring the clear teaching of the Bible to support his own warped, carnal worldview.This guy has absolutely no respect for the authority of the Scriptures, so I have little respect for his opinion on spiritual matters. If you also don't put stock in the Bible then you might like book."
4,Great for pets,"I had another Hoover that was 2 years old and caught of fire. I found this one for 69.99 and thought I would give it a try. It has a much better suction than my old Hoover. I did one small section of my bedroom (5 x 5) and filled the canister with dog hair and dust. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you have to make sure the onboard hose is securely attached to the output hose on the vacuum itself to make sure you are getting the maximum suction. It is a little messy to empty, but I just dump it outside in a trash bag and I am done."
1,filthy vac!,"I hate cleaning this vaccuum cleaner. After using, I take the cartridge outside and bang off the dirt and then I vaccuum the vaccuum. How lame is that?"
2,bad suction,"I bought this vaccum 6 mo. ago, it was really good for the first 3 weeks or so, then went down hill. It does not suck very well just throws dirt from one place to another. and I have cleaned it very well. I do not recomend this product. It is easier to store, but that's about it."
1,Excellent Door Prop; That's About It,"I use this thing to hold a door open. That's all it's good for. It sucks. And by ""sucks"", I mean it bites. I wish I had my money back to invest in the Dyson and Shark I now own and LOVE. Avoid at all costs."
1,Extremely poor product,"I've had this vacuum about a year and it is a very poor performer. The filter gets filled with dusts right away-- I mean, within one cleaning, the vacuum is already sucking for air and losing performance. The dirt canister is small-- my house is 2000 square feet and I can't vacuum the whole house without emptying the ""cup"" at least once. And the replacement filters are expensive and not washable (what a surprise).It's cheap, but you get what you pay for in this case. Not good for wood floors or tile, either because it kicks up dust and little things from the hardwood or tile floors."
2,"Poor quality, lots of hassel","I got this when I moved into my new house in 2003. I was happy with it for a little while, but then it lost most of it's suction. It worked properly for less than a year.I can still use it, but the posture necessary to make it work is very uncomfortable. It seems the suction is being lost through the area around the handle for the collection bucket. If I bend to hold my hand over this area while vacuuming, then it still works ok.At the time I bought this, it was a new item and had several great reviews. Now I see that the low rating reviews here are complaining of similar issues as the problems I've had.I eventually got a very old used dirt devil that works much better than this item. I suggest that you don't waste your money on this machine."
1,Doesn't suck after only a few uses,Purchased the vacuum in June and used it a total of 5 times. Then it stopped sucking anything up. Am currently in the process of trying to get it repaired but there are very few repair places around.If I had known what this vacuum was like I would not have purchased it. Buy a nicer vacuum; I am regretting not paying a little bit more for a much better quality vacuum. I used to be a big Hoover fan but I will never buy another Hoover vacuum again.
4,Very Good Vacuum if you apply a little TLC !!!,"I own this vacuum and I am buying another for a friend. WITH A LITTLE TLC, this is an awesome cleaner. Tips: Empty the collection container after 1 or 2 uses; Wipe off the lint from around the filter after a few uses - take it outside and shake it off. This is exactly how you would treat a shop vac. If you care for it, and take the time, it is a great cleaner. If suction is a problem - look below and check the roller. It may have thread wrapped around it. Remove it! It's very simple and sucks up well."
3,Bagless doesn't mean messless,"I had a Hoover with a bag that was pushing eight years, so I thought this model looked like a decent replacement, and I liked the idea of the fold-down handle. However, after having to dump out the container and clean the filter, I'm still wondering what's so great about a bagless vacuum. I'd rather replace a bag four times a year than wrestle with the mess of the bagless after every couple of vacuums. I do like the fold-down handle, although it makes getting the power cord wound correctly a bit difficult, and this model has larger wheels than my old one, which makes handling a bit better. It's decent, but if I had pets or kids probably wouldn't be sufficient."
2,Very Noisy!!!!,"We bought this unit to replace a twenty year old Eureka that had finally said enough. The fold down handle and 15"" wide sweep sold us.When we got it home it turned out to be the wrong one for us. The vacuum as a whole works great. Plenty of suction, sturdy construction, and a large enough canister for the small area we have. But does it scream? You bet. Very, very loud. I have a 16g shop vac that is half as loud.We returned the unit the next day and tested 5 other units in the store. We ended up settling on the EMPower unit. Essentially the same unit but with some motor controls that reduces the volume of the unit by about 1/2. I also noticed the housing was insulated and the previous unit was not."
1,Hoover is Horrible,"My recent letter to Hoover~I am trying to find out why my warranty repairs are taking so long. The motor on my Fold-Away Upright burned out after only 8 mos. I took it to the hoover service center 3 weeks ago. They say they ordered the parts the next day and have still not receied them. Has there been a rash of burned out motors and you just cant produce them as quickly as they go bad? The motor should have lasted signifacantly longer to begin with and now you are failing to honor your warranty in a timely manner. When this second motor burns out 8 mos. from now I dont believe I'll be purchasing another Hoover to replace it. However I still woul like to have my original vacuum back before the warranty expires, so hopefully somebody down there could wrap up a motor and put a stamp on it in the not too distant future.The motor burned up after 8 months of normal household cleaning, I hardly even used the hose and I only have 3 rooms that have carpet."
1,WORST VACUUM EVER - DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR!,"DON'T BUY IT.The only good feature about this ""thing"" is the fold down handle ... WOW BIG DEAL. I was suckered into that feature.This vacuum does not clean. It clogs, whatever it vacuums is spit out through the back of it, the hose nozzle constantly slips off and it just does not do a good job."
2,Poor quality,"I asked for this vacuum on our wedding registry almost 2 years ago and I really regret it. I loved the idea of a bagless vacuum with a fold down handle, but don't let appearances fool you! I have 2 cats and an average amount of dust and dirt. I have to go over the same area several times and often have to resort to picking up the hair and lint. I empty the canister and shake out the filter after each use (this process is very messy, by the way). However, even with this constant upkeep, it's still not a great vacuum. The most irritating thing is that the hose comes off constantly when you vacuum. I vacuum often because I just don't feel that it cleans well. I have a baby coming and I am considering investing in something better. My old cheaper vacuum was much better."
3,Wish I had Waited,"A good deal at $59.99, especially after I paid $84.14 to Amazon and now feel like a sucker."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This product is very weak, not very powerful and unsuitable for massage it is just a toy and I sent it back"
2,Poor power,"Poor power, the low and high option has the same power, you don't see a difference between them, it heats when used for a few minutes, if you're looking for something that gives powerful massage these is not the perfect item. It didn't meet my expectations."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed this massager did not have enought power to massage the nerves as I expected it would it was a waste of my money.
2,"a toy, not a massager","It is lightweight and quiet, both pluses. But it's power is entirely inadequate for massage. The first one I purchased I returned because I thought the speed button was defective. But the second one did the same thing - there's no noticeable difference between the low and high speeds."
2,Only 2 stars,Only 2 stars. Almost not worth plugging up. There is no massage power. There is no need for this unit to have 2 speeds. They are both about the same; slow and low. It will take you hours to relieve any tension using this product. The first usage it sounded like it was on it's last leg.
1,"No power, not worth the money!","I purchased this because I was looking for a more powerful massage than the battery powered hand held models and I can't believe it, the vibration is worthless! Please don't waste your money on this, there is not even enough vibration to soothe a sore finger! I have just ordered the Wahl and I hope that I will have better luck. ......I really hate to say this but I need to add that my husband and I were hoping that this massager would double for a 'personal toy' but there is not even enough power for that. So ladies, look elsewhere!"
2,cheap,Seems really cheap even the heads are a really hard plastic and not that comfortable. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
1,Poor quality,"hardly vibrates, and gets very hot. Would not purchase Conair again.Wahl's are a much better brand, better quality too."
2,Conair massager,vibration is not that strong to help with the massage. The attachments are practical. But is compact.I wish it was stronger
2,Not powerful enough,"Like some people said, the motor just isn't powerful on this massager. Can barely feel it. Not worth sending back, though."
3,facial,"I Like to use to massage my face after clean.this product have good action,durable I have for many years. no strong power, but work well to facial massage. No expensive ,so I recommended."
3,Fine for a Gentle Massage,"Not as powerful as a Wahl 4120, which I also have, but for a gentle massage I think it's fine; comparing the 2, I can see times where this might be preferable to a more powerful massager. It seems to hold up well; the one I have is about 4-5 years old now. I also like the shapes of the attachments and smaller size (as compared to the Wahl). I did notice that at this time it costs more than the Wahl, so the Conair is definitely overpriced in my opinion."
1,Too weak for therapy or pleasure!,"We ordered this massager strickly for recreational bedroom use, to replace one we had owned for many years. The massager that we had previously was very similar in appearance to this Conair, but as it turns out, significantly more powerful. Unfortunately the old one was thrown out without verifying the brand name or model number, so we were replacing it without that information. This Conair massager is very inadequate for my wife and doesn't get the job done, even on the higher setting. She is fairly sensitive and hasn't been able to tolerate stronger settings on some toys we have tried over the years. It's a good thing this was inexpensive, because it was a complete waste of money. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly get any benefit from it for sore muscles or other therapeutic uses when it can't even provide adequate sensations in the most sensitive of spots! Totally useless in our opinion."
2,poor performance,"such a disappointment. I've purchased and been a fan of other Conair products over the years. this item completely misses the mark.as other reviews have noted the motor is unbelievably underpowered and I would describe the performance as such; if you want to rub a tiny itch on your chin this would suffice. I""ve rated this product a 1 out of 5 due to its multiple defects. no muscle relief could result from use of this product. and any other use would also fall greatly short.this Conair has been manufactured by Wahl, which has historically produced great products but not this one. I would recommend the Wahl 4120-200 as a superior choice and is available from Amazon."
2,Not powerful enough,"If you expect this massager to help loosen up your muscle, don't buy it. But if you want it to massage your scalp, it would work."
3,Product Okay,NOT HAPPY about shipment paid for overnight Holiday hit and then the weekend so did not get it till 5 days later
1,Not good at all,"POS, has little power and sad but true has the conair name on it but not the qaulity they are known for. I think all in all this product sucks."
1,"Horrible, worthless, almost no power - shouldn't even be sold","I purchase another massager that looked like this one (had no brand name on it). It burned and had to rewire literally more than a dozen times I loved it so much. I guess that's what happens when you use it for hours at a time. I loved it and though this would be a good replacement. No so, it is terrible, VERY weak (maybe 1/4 power out) with no difference between settings. I am still looking for a replacement, my netherworld is aching for a better option."
3,just ok,"Just like one I got in 1981. Fine if you don't need to use it long, motor gets hot very quickly. Quiet. Arrived very quickly."
1,If only the best team won.,"""Reggie Reggie Reggie"" could easily have been a ""Dodger Dodger Dodger"" if they even made a token effort to get him."
1,False Advertising,"I am disappointed with this leather case. Nearly all of the listing is incorrect. It does not have a free slide swivel clip or a mini clip, it does not fit the HP iPAQ 2215 well at all, it is extremely tight (I don't know about other models). It is difficult to zip. When the case is on the device, you can't even remove the stylus. There is no plastic protection, and I can't find any SD card storage. Do not buy unless you wish to be ripped off!"
1,Not described right,This is made for a EZ Sport with small rear wheel. i have model with Large rear wheel (EZ Sport CX). this does not fit. THis should of been mentioned in the description or else they sent the wrong size. now i have to go thru the hassle of returning it. Even if it would fit there were nuts missing to attach it lugs on lower frame & directions were absolutely horrible.
1,Riptide Season 1,I watched 5 of the episodes which were very good.The 6th episode froze up and the last dvd didn't work at all when I put it in the player.Made an awful sound.
4,Riptide - a fun detective series,"Its great to see this tv series finally released. Some of the special effects may be a little dated or cheesy but the dialogue is crisp, fast & fun. Perry King & Joe Penny were at their physical peak & very easy on the eyes. They also had a real chemistry & easy banter that was believeable as long-time friends running a detective agency. They also managed to squeeze in a racing car, speeding boat or swooping helicopter chase in each episode. Worth the price & hope to see season 2 & 3 released soon."
5,I love this man!,"This man brought up one very true statement that I really had no time to think about. The fact that pain is an illusion. The things this man has wrote in this book have changed my life around. I think more possitive, and I always try to remember his ideas and put them to use."
3,Universal Principles,"This book presents some rather unusual concepts which when applied could dramatically change one's life. However the author makes a basic mistake in his presentation by focusing on changing your ""thoughts,"" wherease the real emphasis should be placed on allowing your feelings to flow through you to recreate this change.In his later books, he mentions this mistake, and offers suggestions for corrrecting this error.The difficulty in applying Universal Principles lies in one's resistance to actually allowing the Universe to guide you without your conscious mind's interference.The book will give you a unique perspective for creating a life of abuandance."
4,Joint effort with Oprah Winfrey?,"""One of the most important books I have ever read,"" is the quote on the cover (at the very top) by Oprah Winfrey.You Can Have It All is a powerful, thought-provoking book. Arnold M. Patent explains how we can have love, joy, inner peace, and unlimited abundance. The foreward is written by John Gray who has been on Oprah's tv show. Appears almost like a ""who has been on Oprah joint effort,"" but that's okay.The material is heavy, and certainly isn't light reading, but highly entertaining. The only flaw is there is too much information, too much explaining that by the end of the book I actually applauded myself for finishing the book.I do recommend the book for anyone who wish to renew awareness with the Universe. Take your time. Enjoy."
3,Not as informative as it might have been,"""Luke Kelly: A Memoir"" is a look at the life of the important Irish musician who sang and played with the Dubliners from the mid-1960s until his death in 1984. Author Des Geraghty was himself a significant figure of the time, serving as a union leader and later as a member of the European Parliament, representing Dublin.There's more of Des Geraghty and less of Luke Kelly than someone looking for details of the late musician's life might want. Still, his humor, his talents and his love of life come through. Kelly was a unique talent, and this biography makes that clear. Perhaps the best way to learn about him is to listen to his music."
3,Cheap Watch,I'm sorry to say that this watch is not very durable. I love the looks and the functions but my watch is not holding up to even light use.The Elven O'clock jewl has detached and is floating around underneath the crystal after dropping it.The bottom left button is stuck in the 'in' position.Rarely been in salt water and rarely in fresh water. Never been deeper than 25 feet.I'll send it back to get it fixed with the warranty.Seems you get what you pay for wich is not much in this case.
5,Make Momstown Your Next Stop!,"A sensational how-to expertly marketed that delves into the challenges facing stay-at-home moms trying to sew motherhood, personal enrichment, and professional success into their life quilt. Goulet and Reider dually succeed in identifying and providing solutions to the time challenges moms encounter by providing real-world organizational solutions to mothers in a step-by-step process culminating in just 10 weeks. The Momstown Guide to Getting it All in-and-of itself shows just how entrepreneurial mothers can lead an integrated life of financial and societal success. Bravo!"
1,Save Your Money!,"1 Star only because 0 stars isn't an optionObviously the author has never lived in a household where your spouse works odd hours. My husband works on the night shift in Okinawa, Japan where we are stationed with the US Military. I felt like throwing this book in the trash within the first 10 pages. My husband is going to sleep as our son and I are getting up...does it REALLY make sense for me to make up our bed every day? What am I supposed to do- make it up with him in it? I have to vaccum our house at 8pm at night! Seriously, people.Also, despite the author's adament claims about not trying to get you away from your children, it doesn't seem that way. I don't like the idea of dumping my child off on a babysitter constantly. He's MY child. I'm not going to pay someone to keep him all the time when I'm a STAY AT HOME MOM. That's the point of being a stay-at-home-mom, isn't it?To get to the point: if your household is anything other than ""normal""- don't waste your money."
1,Serious Disappointment,"I won't rehash the comments already made by others disappointed by this book, but let's just say I agree. My biggest complaint is how they talked over and over about their great website ""community"" and the wonderful resources available online. When I visited that site I found nothing but a shop for their products and a commercial for their Dr. Phil segments. No forum at all! The recipes are outsourced to an organic market whose ingredients lists sound great, but good luck finding half the stuff in a rural area. And this month's featured recipe has a prep time of 1 hour for a side dish! How many Moms have time for that?Would not recommend this book unless your life has gone so far off the rails you need someone to tell you how to take a shower and make your bed. Get real."
5,Great Guide!,"This book has helped me to simplify my life. Before 3.5 years ago, I was a successful executive who had everything organized. Staying at home with my angel was the best decision I have ever made. But motherhood had thrown me for a loop - and unraveled that life. This book breaks everyday tasks into the lowest common denominator. As with life, you should pick and choose what works for you and go with that. I know it sounds juvenile to have to 'make your bed' everyday - but for some of us - it has taken these basic steps to turn the bigger issues around. I am now purchasing 5 more books for other girl friends!"
2,Disappointing...,"I loved the ""idea"" of this book. As a happy/proud SAHM, I love books about homemaking and SAHM-hood. However, this one I have to say was very disappointing.Basically, nearly the whole time I was reading this, the thought that kept going through my head was ""PLEEEASE stop talking to me as if I were 4 years old!"".I felt that the ""tone"" of the book was very much like an annoying mom using ""pep talk"" with her preschooler.I will give it 2 stars, simply because I really applaud any efforts to help todays SAHM."
2,BAD REVIEW FOR BATMAN MICROMAN,THE ITEMS WERE MINISCULE IN SIZE; MY SON COULD NOT PLAY WITH FIGURINES WELL. OVERPRICED!!! A BIG WAIST OF MONEY!!!
1,Very displeased.,"The seller did a great job getting this to me promptly. However, any buyer should do NOTHING but leave this in the package and look at it. It is in no way durable. The heads, arms, hands, and legs of both characters fall of at the slightest touch. Poseability is worthless if the items break."
3,Not For Kids or Pets,"This is a Japanese import with several tiny parts. While taking them out of the package, they literally ""fell apart"".Batgirl has a black and yellow costume instead of her purple & yellow suit from the television series.Still a great toy for an adult to display or just as a great collectible!"
1,Bootleg,"I produced the concert and have the original tapes in my possession. I have never licensed anyone to produce a CD of the soundtrack. As far as I know, none of the band's members authorized this bootleg. It is made from the mono sound track of a very poor quality hand-held video camera and has a bad buzz throughout the recording. I recommend you pass on this latest in the rather sad bootleg history of Roky and this band."
3,Thirteenth Floor Elevators - 'Reunion Concert' (TKO/Magnum),"First question that might enter your mind when you hear about this CD,is rather if it's a 'real' live concert recording,with the Elevators being known for putting out 'faked live' releases.This eight track archive performance seems(to me)to be authentic.Noted as taken place on August 11,1984.Question I have,is that is this REALLY a 13th Floor Elevators reunion,or possibly a Roky Erickson solo gig?Either way,it's an okay disc.Better tunes are ""Splash 1"",the foot-stomping ten-minute ""Don't Slander Me"",""Bloody Hammer"" and ""Two Headed Dog"".Should have included at least one more early TFE song."
2,"Historical, but lousy quality","A cd consisting of a somewhat diffuse 1984 reunion performance of the legendary 13th Floor Elevators. Since Sutherland was dead and Hall not around, it's obviously a weakened lineup, and an odd gig because of their playing too much material from Roky's solo career and too little from the Elevators. It's still a good performance, probably better than anyone could have expected; too bad the sound is quite poor. Better than nothing, though.Considering all the above, this release is really only for the more devoted fans. Do NOT buy this if you're just looking into the band."
4,"5 stars for the music, minus one for poor quality control",The music on this reunion cd(yes I believe it is a legit reunion performance) is excellant. Roky is at top form playing these songs from his solo career with his former bandmates. It would have been better(and made more sense this is a reunion concert and not a solo performance) for the band to have played more songs from the Elevators repetoire. My only complaint is that the cd has Clear Night For Love play twice and fails to seperate the final two songs into two tracks but lists them as seperate tracks on the back. aside from this quality control error and the lack of Elevators material this cd is most excellant. It should probably be bought by someone who is just as familiar with Roky's solo material as with the 13th Floor Elevators if it is to be properly appreciated.
5,good quality,"i paid 3 bucks for it,and i love it,it stretches,holds up well to eeryday use,nice enough to wear on a date,and it's got several strings holding it together,seems sturdy.iwill buy more for friends."
5,100 Hits Of Pure Acid!,"I don't know if it's true but sometime during the last year I heard that ANb were being considered for the Guiness Book of World Records, something about ""the most songs on one album."" There are 100 songs on ""Altered States of America"" and they last anywhere from 2-10 seconds (the longest being Wonder Drug Wonderland which clocks in at 1:47) although they blend seamlessly into one another so more often than not you won't know where one song ends and another begins. All in all this is one hell of an album. Filthy drug ridden lyrics, outrageous song titles, great riffs, throat ripping vocals.....it's all here for your listening pleasure."
2,I will pass on this one,"Maybe I dont get it but this CD is unlistenable. Its not even good. there are no redeeming factors to this at all. Its Horrible. Its as if they took two crappy songs and cut them up in to 100 ""songs"" Dont get me wrong I like Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Frozen Corpses... and Agorapocolps are great so its not that I dont like heavy music.The thing is, is that its just not good. you cant actually listen to this album. Its truly a waste of 15 dollars thats all I am saying."
2,"Okay for a cheap iron, but very cheap!","There is not much to this iron; I had gotten used to my old iron and thought that this one would duplicate its function - but keep in mind that this little iron will only steam up on the highest settings; which limits your ironing options and makes t-shirt transfers impossible. It also managed to melt one of my shirts, but that's probably this reviewer's fault, rather than it's!"
3,Depends what you are looking for,"This book is great if you are looking for sample letters, but if you are looking for hints, suggestions, or guilines you will not find them in this book. The book has page after page of sample letters, both well written letters and poorly written letters."
4,Dead Kennedys - 'Mutiny On The Bay' (Manifesto) 4 1/2 stars,"Full title:'Mutiny On The Bay-Dead Kennedys Live!From The San Francisco Bay Area'.Apparently,former vocalist Jello Biafra had lost a lengthy court battle to block the release of 'Mutiny...',the one of just two legit live Dead Kennedy archive performanes.This fourteen track CD was pulled from four(4)different live shows that took place in 1982 and 1986,which is 'strung' together as one.I LIKE that in a live release.Overall,just great body slammin' all American punk.Tunes that did it for me were ""Holiday In Cambodia"",the in-your-face ""Moon Over Marin"",the radical ""MTV-Get Off The Air"",""Too Drunk To F**k"" and ""Hell Nation"".Line-up:Biafra-vocals,East Bay Ray-guitar,Klaus Flouride-bass and D.H.Peligro-drums.A must-have for any and all true fans of 'angry/misguided' punk.Should appeal to fans Minor Threat,Black Flag,T.S.O.L.,Circle Jerks and The Germs."
3,Mediocre,"A posthumous, well produced live recording spanning the majority of the band's career. It's like a greatest hits live album. It's got pretty little ditties like ""Moon Over Marin"" and ""This Could Be Anywhere,"" that's a plus. However, it doesn't have any of the better Bedtime For Democracy songs that were occasionally played live. The playing ranges from great to sloppy, like ""Police Kill the Poor."" Sadly, there's no hilarious stage banter Jello was known for.It's good, but not a necessary album. This is a grab for the wallets. They should have released rare songs. Oh well, Jello cheated the band and used their money for his own use, so the band reunited out of spite. This album was bound to be released sooner or later regardless of what label it was on. Why people support Jello like they do is beyond me. This isn't so much a review as it is to point out that Jello's a crook."
1,don't buy this cd,this is not even approved by Jello Biafra his ideas made the dead kennedys what they are and without him they are just becoming another stale cartoon
3,Hey its live Kennedys what else ya want?,"Yes I did purchase this disc knowing about the legal matters. And really you dont know who to believe in the case. Jello in my opinion was less than 100% honest. The other members who knows. As far as the album goes i thought it was good. Hell I'm only 28 years old I was too young to enjoy them in their prime. I would of liked to hear Biafra comments on the album but i guess the remaining members got fed up with hearing his bantor for so many years. If you like the kennedys buy it. Guess what?,you can make your own decision on this dont let hardcore alternative tentacle fans steer you from listening to one of the founding hardcore bands live and in their 80's heyday."
1,Mute on the Bay,"The Dead Kennedys were a great band, but much of their live material is sub-par, they never really had the money or ability at the time to record a whole live album, thus we are stuck with many badly taped bootlegs and this, a badly taped semi-authorized stinkfest. There isn't anything interesting on this cd first of all, the tracks are performed pretty badly and there are no interesting rare gems in here. The ex-members just wanted to make money that just isn't there, they can't cash in off those blink-182 kids because they'd hate the sound, as would anyone. Only a rare breed of music fans would even like the DK's to begin with as they aren't the Beatles, it was more about the state of mind they put you in, and all that is SHATTERED."
2,Information overload,"Bluntly, this 50-something is too old, tired and lazy for this book. I wanted a book on simple isometric upper-body exercises I could do at home that wouldn't injure me. When it arrived and I saw all the information, explanations and exercises the well-intentioned author included, I got overwhelmed. I'm happy with a nice walk and climbing the stairs a few times a week, if my knees let me. If you want detailed information, this book is for you, as the author did a good job with what she presented. I'll just think about it while I'm admiring my neighbors landscaping as I stroll by."
2,Caution,"I'm just now reading my book from cover to cover, nearly a year after I purchased it. I am missing pages 271-302. Pages 239-270 are repeated in their place. Of course now it is too late to return the book.The book is wonderful. Too bad I can't read it all."
3,Cute but not exceptional quality,"The design is cute as shown and it matches with the frog boots that my son already has but I am not thrilled with the quality of the inside lining. The ""mositure-absorbent liner for added comfort"" is made of an extremely thin layer of polyester. It doesn't look like it will add any ""comfort"" at all. So, don't expect this to keep you warm as well as dry when the weather is cold and wet."
5,S Club Have Dne It Again!!!,"Well no one wonder it went to #1 in England. Don't Stop Movin' is a hot disco song that will get you on the dancefloor movin to that funky funky beat. The song is hot, Brad and Jo do a great job!!! And the Remix is even hotter!!!! I am very impressed with Jewels & Stone. And right guy is a great song written and performed by bradley. Don't miss this single or you will regret it!!!"
5,Don't stop Movin' is awesome!,Don't Stop Movin' is awesome! It was their 3rd #1 hit in UK. It even made the the weeks non-consectutive!! It's my fav. song by them. The Jewels and stone mix is even funkier. I like that too. Right Guy is really good. Even though it's not a chart topper.... we all love it! I know 4 songs for [cheap] sounds a bit over weighted but it's worth it!
5,Love it!,I bought this for my husband (I know...no judgement). It's awesome! The print is perfect. The delivery was timely and we're quite satisfied.
4,My son likes it,"My son is an awesome BBQ (smoker) man. He loves Denver Broncos. So I couldn't lose. Not the same quaility as if I had made it, but then on the flip side, I didn't spend 10 hours cutting it out and sewing it together, just to see it covered in BBQ sauce! So we are both happy."
1,lame shocks,"I bought two of these shocks for the rear end of a Toyota LC KZJ70 and I had them installed just this morning. It turns out that my LC bounces like there were no shocks on it. My OEM shocks which were over 65K miles worked just like the first day I put them on. I also bought two other Ranchos for the front end and they are the worst, I get to hit the bump stops in the minor road bump. I'm seriously having my old OEM shocks reinstalled tomorrow because Rancho Shocks are a big fraud. To bad I live out of the USA to claim my money back on them."
1,Wanted a toy - not a collectible,"I wanted a toy for my grandson - not a collectible. It came in pieces with no instructions. When I was shopping, I made sure I avoided buying one that said it came without instructions. I was very disappointed and it was not at all worth the money,"
3,a big disappointment,"i had eagerly looked forward to this cd. i have two records(actually three since one is a double set recording) of frau leander's gretest recordings. however, this one did not even contain what i feel is her greatest hit from ""die grosse lieb'-1942-""davon geht die welt nicht unter"" and the recording of ""yes sir"" is in french. a big disappointment. not worthy of die grosse zarah.>"
5,Great Read!,"Found ""Forrorois"" very engaging, last third nearly impossible to put down. Characters well developed and description of settings true to characters and plot line. Liked the way story related to existing locations in NY state. Can't wait for the next installment."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this to replace my old Hoover (which I loved, and lasted me 10 yrs.), thinking I might like bagless. This vaccum was messy, loud and when I used a powder carpet cleaner it spewed dust all over my house. For the money, I would expect a lot better. I'm guessing to avoid the problem I had, you might have to change the filter constantly, which would become extremely expensive and wasteful. Considering I emptied the dirt cup every time I used it and it still was messy and dusty. Terrible, now I don't even want another Hoover vaccum."
1,Worthless,I bought this vacuum from Home Depot a few weeks ago. I vacuumed my carpet and wood floors and was entirely unimpressed. The carpet was still full of dirt and it did NOTHING for the wood floors. Returned it two days later. Don't buy this vacuum.
1,Ode to a vacuum,"I finally retired my old hand-me-down college vacuum about a year ago and decided to go with this nice, Hoover, mid-ranged bagless. The first one I bought started smoking and sparking within a week. I took the flame thrower back and asked for another. I had a rocky relationship with the second one, sometimes it worked for me, and sometimes it didn't. And then, within a year, it just died...no sputtering, no warning. Dead.I think I will run over it with my car, then go Dyson shopping."
1,Mediocre performance,"This was the top-of-the-line bagless vacuum cleaner available at a local retailer. It doesn't do a good job in general, particularly on pet hair. The main vacuum has little power, and the attachments have next to none. I would not purchase this product again."
5,Review of Online Version,"It's not often that a documentary will inspire a sequel, but Dominic DeJoseph's film JOHNNY BERLIN did, largely as a result of the enthusiasm of the Documentary Channel audience who demanded a follow-up. In Part 1 (titled simply, JOHNNY BERLIN), we last left Johnny, a train porter with dreams of writing the great American novel, as he was headed to Southeast Asia in search of deeper truths. Part 2 picks up after his trip into destitution standing on a bridge over the Mekong River, contemplating everything from jumping off the bridge to his relationship to his Mormon father who wouldn't send him the money for a plane ticket home. Although at times Johnny's head trip turns to the darker aspects of life, his off-beat sense of humor lands him on his feet every time, and the viewer along with him. This is a hilarious exploration of one man's inner life, and a worthy follow-up, often deeper and funnier than the first film."
3,Poor Audio !!!,This is an excellent album but I expected CD technology would improve its audio but it didn't. That's quite a shame. I used to have this album on tape and this CD doesn't sound any better. It needs to be remastered!
4,not my favorite but I love it.,I love listening to Savatage and this album is no different. I do prefer the albums Gutter Ballet and Dead Winter Dead over this but its a great track and the one that got me into Savatage in the first place.
2,Not a good album,"I loved ""Wake Of Magellan"" from savatage, so i tried this one.All what I can say is that this sounds like extremely dated and boring Metal of the 80's full of cliches... a couple of songs are good (specially the title track ,I like that one), but in general this album is a joke compared with ""The Wake Of Magellan"", the vocals suck, and the music is soooo generic and boring... This could be good for old fans of Savatage, sometimes music reminds the old times you know... but nowadays I don't recommend this album to anyone who don't know the band, try the albums of the 90's from savatage.P.S: It's not that i don't like music from the 80's, Iron Maiden is my favourite band!!"
1,THE WORST CLICHES AVAILABLE...,"HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING unites the worst heavy metal cliches ever invented, DUngeons and Dragons lyrics included... Also, Jon Oliva vocals are awful, just awful...Zak Stevens is a much, much better singer!Even with Oliva on vocals, the band improved dramatically in their latter efforts like GUTTER BALLET and STREETS. HALL OF... is just juvenile and brainless heavy metal. Skip it."
3,Is it good or bad?,"I can point out the pros and cons about this album. Here are the pros: Very catchy riffs, very good solos, and the best instrmental to include a classical song(Prelude to Madness). However, there are some problems:It's to short, being only 39 minutes, the singer can be silly, espceially on ""Beyond the Doors of the Dark."", and the songs are not long enough (the longest song being 5:34). So, I don't know if this is good or bad. And, it needs to be re-masteerd. POOR audio! However, ""Strange Wings"" ia the most catchy song ever known to mankind. Bye!"
5,DRUMS ARE COOL,"THE DRUMMING IN THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE...MY FAV TRACK ON THIS ALBUM IS LEGIONS, BECAUSE IT MAKES MY EYES GO WHACK AND THE DRUMMING IS SO GOOD...EVEN MAC DAWG WOULD BUY THIS ALBUM..CHECK IT OUT YO...PEACE!"
4,Savatage - Hall of the Mountain King,"Hall of the Mountain King, además de ser un clásico del Heavy Metal, fue uno de los primeros discos que consideré como ""Progressive Heavy Metal"" ya que ""tendía a salirse del esquema"" de lo que uno consideraba como ""Traditional Heavy Metal"".Es una excelente, equilibrada y concisa producción llena de fuerza temática, buen sonido y excelente ejecución a lo largo de sus menos de 40 minutos de duración. Es un disco que obliga a escucharse entero.Altamente recomendado."
4,Old Metal,Remember when they actually sang on metal recordings? Well here is Savatage at it's best in my opinion. Great guitar playing and good singing. Almost like an old Metal Church album. This is Savatage before they got a little too far from their roots of metal (like the Wake of Magelin).
4,Nicely Confused,"Bought this on spec for Hall of the Mountain King after Accept's guitarist Wolf Hoffman did a version of it (which I think is better because it's purer, but Savatage's extension is brilliant none-the-less). First listening was: ho-hum, second listening was: this ain't half bad, third listening: jammed in the CD player! This is a great metal CD - the vocals are wierd, but addictive and what a sensational range; the guitars (and vocals) remind me a bit of Accept (albeit a more learned version, more sophisticated maybe?) and a bit of a whole lot of other metal that I can't quite put my finger on, maybe even some thrash creeping in? This is seriously good metal, good riffs, power and grind. Turn it up LOUD!"
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS!,"METAL FANS - MUSIC FANS PERIOD, THIS ALBUM IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!! IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GROUP THAT LACKS NO SHORTAGE OF INTENSITY IN COMBINATION WITH AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER INTERESTING COMPOSITIONS, GET THIS ALBUM AS IT WON'T LEAVE YOU HANGING! FROM THE OUTSET, SAVATAGE NEVER LOOKS BACK, DISPLAYING SOME VERY INNOVATIVE MOMENTS AND DOES THIS ALBUM EVER HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE GUITAR LICKS/RHYTHMS, NOT TO MENTION SOME VERY ORIGINAL VOCALIZATION! BEST SONGS ARE ""LEGIONS"", ""BEYOND THE DOORS OF THE DARK"", ""PRELUDE TO MADNESS/HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING"", ""STRANGE WINGS"" AND THE INSTRUMENTAL ""LAST DAWN""."
1,Bait & Switch,"I had the EXACT same result at the first reviewer--I searched for & thought I purchased the steam curling iron that is shown on the picture, and instead got the cheapest model curling iron that Conair makes. I am very angry and have little hope that customer service will satisfy this problem."
1,Wanted one,I'm glad that I read these reviews. I have been looking for a Steam Curling Iron for a long time because they are supposed to be better for your hair than a regular iron. I used to have one and it lasted for many years. This is the only kind of Iron I will use. Thank you for letting others know.
2,why cant we hear the songs????,"Just curious....I have always been a White Lion fan and I love all their music...but why have they now decided to not allow you to hear their music before you buy it?????????? And no digital download????? I think they need to get with the times and wake up!!!!!!! I bought another 80's band CD because they allowed me to listen to parts of tracks before I bought it, and they allowed Digital Downlaod...WAKE UP LION!!!!!! YOUR LOSING BUSINESS!!!!!!!"
4,White Lion (PRIDE),"Awesome album. Im 33 Years old and a first time listener to White Lion. I heard of them for a number of years but for some reason or another, I never bought their album. But man i'm sure glad I did. Get the album. It's good time Heavy Metal, party rock songs about love and rockin' the night. A1 grade for guitar players as this album has awesome guitar work with vocals that match perfectlly."
3,"Not a Smash, But Not Bad Either","Granted. This is not the most essential record out there. But it's not bad either. I myself lean more towards Bon Jovi, Megadeth, and King Diamond. But this record shows that lighter music can have charm too. If you are a strict heavy metal fan, then this record is probably not for you. But there is beauty to be found in this effort. 'Hungry,' 'Lady of the Valley,' and 'Join Our Hands' all carry a nice sound. Also, I do commend this group for not hiding behind excess noise, obscenities, or trite issues. This record is probably not worth a long trip to an expensive 'you name it, we got it' place. But if you are able to find it, pick it up and give it a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised."
3,"Another reminiscent of the hair metal plague, but...","This is another reminiscent of the hair metal plague, but at least is a good album: it has Michael Wagener as producer and a very good guitar player called Vito Bratta.The songs are boring and outrageous or pedestrian like most of the hair metal bands of that time, and this is this band's best album."
2,Too Light,"I'm the biggest Hair Metal fan but I just can't get into this album. A few songs like ""When the Children Cry"" and ""Lady of the Valley"" sound alright but overall the album just doesn't cut it. All of the songs on here are pretty much just ballads and there are no real moments of heavy guitars or heavy vocals. It isn't bad, but when you want something heavy this is not the cure for it."
1,White Lion and Warrant were the last nail in the coffin.,"Nothing ruined a night more for a bunch of stoned headbangers, when HeadBanger's Ball played White Lion. 'When the Children Cry' is by far one of the worst songs ever recorded. (...)Seriously, bands like White Lion, Warrant, and Winger killed 80's rock. They were just ridiculous."
1,"No motter how you see it, this band is another piece of junk","No motter how you see it, this band is another piece of junk of the hair metal era. That's it. (at least Vito whatever played good guitar)."
3,Sound quality sucks,I love the tunes on this CD but I've wondered for years why the sound is awful. They seriously ought to think about a re-master!
1,totally typical. Marks the beginning of the end.,"This is typical hairband stuff that started being mass produced in the late 80's and nineties. Slick production but nothing original or truly noteworthy here. If you like this check out Winger, Slaughter, Poison, Skid Row. Once any form of music becomes mainstream it is inevitable that the clones will come in droves."
5,Excellent book,"This book is by far the best book about italian wine i know.I covers indept allmost every aspect, with describing and rating the producers as the most important.They have visitet many of the small produceres, who normally don't find there way to these kind of books.The problems with the book is that it is old. Many things happens in italian wine theese days.An other problem, or limitation, is the word 'Noble'.It means that only wine that were considered good at that time is included in the book.Jesper Sleth"
1,Defective,"I really wanted this dvd for my collection, but after sending for it 4 times, each time I was sent a dvd with skips in exactly the same spot as all eariler dvd's. The dvd skipped over several pieces, and out of frustration I've have given up on this dvd. I do not know why they continue to sell this item when it must be known it is defective! Buyer Beware!!!"
5,Fantastic Portable Speaker,The overall quality of this little speaker is superb. The sound is great and the construction is solid. We have researched many portable speakers and this unit is the best value we found. We use it with our RCA Pearl and it works great.
5,Love it!,"I bought two, one for my daughter and one for me. It is pretty small but the sound quality is wonderful!!! It sounds like real digital music. Love it!!!"
4,good buy,"This is a really nice product for the price...yes, its not quite a Bose, but costs about 15% of the Bose price tag....it charges my Nano (3rd gen) with no problem. The Nano fit is a bit wobbly, and would be nicer if it were a bit more snug.The sound is very decent. It only has a volume control, and tone controls would be good....but, for $33, even thats OK.You can easily afford to buy several and give them as presents to younger and older folks who enjoy ipods....Overall, this is a great buy...!!"
4,Cyber Acoustics PortableDigital Speakers,Good little speakers. I only use these in the kitchen for when i'm cooking so I dont need a lot of sound or crazy good quality. The speakers are definitely sufficient and look nice and streamlined.
4,Portable iPod docking speaker,"I have been very pleased with this little docking speaker. It's quite simple-no bells and whistles- but sounds great and is compact and easy to move from one place to another. My 9 year old son says he sometimes has a problem seating the iPod properly on the connection but I have never run into an issue, myself, so I can't speak to that. Great product for the price."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I love this speacker, I use it for my iPhone and I love it. The sound quality is awesome for how small the speakers actually are. I thought that this speaker was bigger, and when I received it, I thought that there was no way for it to produce good sound, but I was totally wrong. I have told my friends about this speaker and they got one and are amazed at the squality of the speakers themselves. The value for the money that you spend on this product is worth it. I love that you can charge it or have batteries for the speakers. The product itself is great!"
5,"Great value, good little docking station","I kind of wish I had one with radio features but for my needs, this is perfect. I have other radios. This is very light and portable and I think I got a great bargain!"
2,no pause/play button - off/on button does not control iPod,"It never occurred to me that anyone would make and iPod player without a pause/play button, or one where the off/on switch controls the amplifier but not the iPod. This player is unsatisfactory for listening to audiobooks because you can't stop to answer the phone without losing your place in the book. In my opinion, it's unsatisfactory for music because the bass is pumped up too much and can't be adjusted."
1,short life,"It was an excellent docking speaker. After a month, it started to add some static and then quit. Cheap but unreliable."
2,Somewhat cheap and meager...,"Bought them because they were cheap, and had a lot of positive feedback, but haven't been overly impressed. Within two weeks of buying them, they stopped charging my IPod, and I have to continually fiddle with the Ipod to get it to play out of both speakers. The sound quality is alright -- about what you'd expect for a fifty dollar speaker system. The whole thing is made out of fairly cheap plastic, and it has an overall cheap feel to it. Can't comment on the customer service, because I haven't had time to call them and complain/get a replacement. I definitely wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for use in my office cubicle, so the volume would have to be low. I first tried it out at home at louder levels and it seems to work fine. But when I brought it to work I noticed a ton of speaker feedback. ""Bubba-dub, bubba-dub"" even when the ipod was turned off. I moved it everywhere and it didn't help. I guess it doesn't like to be used at lower volumes. I ended up returning this dock. If you want something inexpensive to play at medium to loud levels, this is a good choice."
2,Disappointed,"I was initially impressed with the sound quality, but after a couple of days, it started making static noises. It would do it almost constantly when my ipod was in it, but it would also occasionally make the noises even without the ipod. Sometimes it would be a constant static noise, and others it would be occasional, but that occasional static noise was very loud. I had the correct adapter in it, so I know that wasn't the issue. A few weeks later, it would every now and then not play my music. I could hear it through my ipod, but not through the speakers. Now, a couple of months after my purchase, all it will do is charge my ipod. I cannot get any sound (except for the static) to come out of it at all."
1,Not Proven yet!,"This item is compact and portable and for the first 3 times that I used it, it worked great. It charged my iPod Touch and the sound was nice for speakers this small. Has adjustments for various iPods. About the fourth time that I put my iPod on the dock to use it, the speakers didn't work. Even with troubleshooting, I could not come up with a reson why the speakers just would not work. Hopefully this one particular item was just defective so I returned it in excahnge for another one. Once I receive the new one I will post another review."
5,works great and sounds great,i ordered this in February 2011 and have used it every day at work since. when i was using it again this morning i was thinking about what a great purchase this was and that i should write a review. i use it with my ipod touch and it sits on my desk at work. it works great and the sound is great. i am very pleased with this docking speaker.
1,Returning it,"I find that I get better sound quality from the speaker on my iPod touch than I do through these speakers! The speakers have the sound quality of a cheap clock radio, including the static and tinny sound. It's not worth keeping this item just to charge my iPod and it has no value as a speaker, as I get better quality just setting the iPod down and listening through the built in speaker. I don't often return items, but will be returning this."
3,"1st one returned, 2nd one ok except for one small glitch",After reading the reviews I thought this would be a good way to listen to ambient sounds produced by the iPod ap Sleep Stream to help me block out my tinnitus and get to sleep more easily. The speakers on the first one I received did not work and the unit shut off sometime during the night so my iPod ended up partially drained in the morning. I returned that unit and ordered another one. This one has good sound. The speakers sometimes do not kick in at the beginning of a musical piece. Tapping the back button on the iPod brings the music back to the beginning so I can hear the whole piece. I'll put up with it because I have no idea what problems a third one might have if I returned this one.
1,Stopped working 1st day!,At first it worked great then just stopped charging or transmitting to speakers from docking station. The only way for the speakers to work is to hook up by Aux. Certainly not worth $36.00 for just that! I am returning and hoping for refund or replacement.
3,Does the job,Bought this product to play in my backyard. It really is not loud enough for the outdoors and if you turn it up to much the sound gets distorted. It does work well inside the house where the sound is more contained and gives off good sound quality in my living room.
1,Electrical Connector Issues,"We received the product and put in the correct adapter for our Ipod. On the very first undocking the electrical connector pulled away from the unit and after that we could not reattach. The product is useless without it. For the price the product is attractive, but it needs some redesign to make it a unit that will last more than a few weeks."
1,Disappointed,"I played music once using these speakers, and they produced a static sound that pretty much overpowered the music at every volume. After the one time, they never turned on again. Very disappointed."
4,Pretty good!,I ordered this to replace a set of iHome speakers at my office that had started acting funny. I was looking for something inexpensive that wouldn't sound like garbage. I wouldn't use this for music for a party or anything but for my office it's perfect and doesn't sound half bad! And despite what their specs say it actually does charge the Nano 3G iPod.
1,Product failed,"This docking station just quit working after a couple of days; the sound stopped functioning. It was almost like something shorted out; I was disappointed, as was my 8-yr old daughter."
1,waste of time and money...,We hoped this would be a decent speaker and good charging dock...it was... for about 3 weeks!! Then the iPod no longer would connect or register so it can't be charged or played...totally useless now...and when I went on tonight to see how to return it it says the return window expired on April 28...so we are out of $36. Don't waste your time or money on this cheap product.
5,Just what we needed,My husband needed some compact speakers so he could listen to his iPod in his cubby at work without wearing headphones. I suggested these and he LOVES them. He says the sound is great even at low volume and he is delighted that it can be played using batteries so we're packing it on our next camping trip.
3,RonfromOregon,"I was satisfied with this product except for the fact that I couldn't get it to work on batteries, it would play for awhile and then stop."
5,IPod Speakers,"Excellent product for the money. Good sound, easy to move and set up. Perfect for a bedroom or office."
5,Love it,This is such a wonderful device.It works so much better than I expected. I have owned it for a year already and I am totally satisfied with it.
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I was looking for speakers for my ipod that I could listen to in any room in the house (by plugging them in), or outside on the deck or on the beach (with batteries). These are exactly what I was looking for, and the sound quality is really great. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy these speakers."
2,sound suddenly stopped,"It was wonderful when I first received it. Nice little size and pretty decent sound and quality. Unfortunately, a few months later, when I tried to use the speakers again, it made a small popping sound and it no longer works. :("
2,You can do better for the price,"This dock is the perfect size, looks good, and is simple in its design. But that's the problem. The buttons are not well designed. It's either blaring or nothing. I can't comment on the sound quality because I can hardly hear it. Not good for an office, bedside, kitchen. Shop around."
1,Not worth a penny!,"I was gifted this for use of iPod at our local pool. After having it plugged into the wall, so it could charge the iPod, I went to unplug it and take it with me. When I unplugged it the machine went into this very loud, feedback sound and completely blew the speakers. It is a total waste of money. Unfortunately the item was a gift and purchased/gifted after 30 days, beyond the return policy. Spend your money more wisely."
2,Sound Quality is lacking,Bought because of the numerous reviews raving about sound quality. Plugged everything in and realized that a much cheaper set of speakers I bought for my office at a big box retailer had better sound quality. I was baffled.Returning this item the sound quality is so bad.
1,Loved it at first,"I loved these speakers at first - they were perfect for listening to music in my apartment without bugging the others. But after a while, it started to make odd noises, ""freezing"" up and making a buzzing noise until I shut the whole thing off, and eventually it would just stop playing my music on my ipod touch (second generation). Now, it crackles and I can't turn up the music more than ""low"" or else it sounds horrible and one of the speakers stops working. Honestly, if this would've kept working I would've given it an excellent review. I wish it would've had a warranty, considering I just purchased it at the end of January. Now I'm left without speakers for my ipod."
1,Broke in just over a month,"I got this docking station for my birthday and loved it at first, but it broke!! It has been about 5 weeks and now the connection between my ipod and the machine is all wonky. If I push down really hard it will connect for a second and then pause my ipod. So annoying. Not worth it."
2,Pretty disappointed...,"I was looking for a decent, cheap set of speakers to listen to my iPod Touch at work. After seeing the stellar reviews here, I thought this was a ""can't-miss.""Well, it may have to do with the low volume levels at which I use the speakers, or with the iPod Touch itself (which I hear does not have great sound), but I get significant bass distortion with these, to the point where some songs become unlistenable. I've tried adjusting the iPod's Equalizer with some improvement, but the distortion is still pronounced. Again, I'm not saying it's necessarily the fault of the speakers, but my listening experience has not been what I anticipated when I purchased them."
3,"Good sound for small machine, distortion when streaming online radio","Overall I am pleased with this purchase for a reasonable priced docking station with speakers. Works great with our various ipod models. The only challenge we have had with this product is distortion and static clicking noise when we are trying to steam music from sources like Pandora. It works great if we turn off the wifi on our iTouch. Also cannot place cell phone too close to machine or also get the static clicking. Other than that, this machine is a good value for the money with better than average sound."
2,Broke after a year,"I used this system at work for a little less than a year. The distortion sound kept occuring more and more frequently the last 6 months. I was initially impressed with the sound quality for its size, but more and more the music would ""break up"". Originally I blamed a cell phone reception as being the culprit, but then it started happening when there was not a cell phone in my office. Then this summer it broke! Where the ipod connects into (the little prongs) - it broke. I know I could have kept it and used the other ports, but with the sounds breaking up and now no way to charge my i-touch at work, I just threw it out. Very sad - only 1 year I got to use it."
2,Does not work with iPod nano 5G,Received the product and was surprised that it does not have the adaptor for iPod nano 5G. Called the manufacture and they told me to purchase an adaptor from Apple. I ended up spending another $14 for the adaptor. (I am not sure if the adaptor will eventually work.)
4,This docking system is AWESOME,"I bought this item to use at work and Im really glad I did. The sound quality is awesome. If I would have known how great it was I would have bought one for home as well. I've been using it for about a month now and the only thing I find is that if someone is using their cell phone near it, it tends to make an annoying buzz. However, the one I have at home (that is more expensive) does the same thing. If your looking for a great, compact docking system for your Ipod I totally reccomend this item."
4,Nice speakers at a great price...for two years,"I use this dock at home with two iPhone 3G's and an iPod Classic 80GB. They all work very well and the sound is better and much louder than I expected at this price point. You'll want to use Airplane mode on the iPhone so the speakers don't blast you with interference. Everything plugs in fine so far, charges, and I haven't had any issues at all. The iPod Classic was just collecting dust until I got this. Now I have a great little stereo with 60GB of music and it's super portable. Couldn't ask for much more.**Update- Currently using these with my iPhone 4 with no issues. Still loving these little speakers.**Update- At about two years, the only device that would play was my old school iPod classic though it wouldn't charge. My daughter destroyed that iPod so these are now in the trash. Still, for the price, not a bad run."
1,"Worked great, then it didn't","I've had this speaker dock mostly in my office for the last 3 months and used it mostly every work day. When it worked, it worked great but then it just stopped working. I am thinking it might work if I could get the insert replaced but I'm not sure I want to spend any more money on it. Disappointing."
3,wonderful until it stops working,i received this as a present last year for Christmas. It has been a wonderful speaker for my ipod touch my 5 yr old loves it too. It stopped working about a week ago and i am quite disappointed because it was basically the only way to listen to my ipod in the house. It is a good deal but too good since it breaks and you're left without anyway to fix it. I would recommend spending more on a better device that wont break
2,Glitches after 2 uses!,This speaker dock is basically a piece of crap. The 2nd time I used with batteries a loud buzzing sound comes from the speaker. The only time this does not happen is when the unit is plugged in. I bought this particular dock because it has the option to be wireless and now I can only use it if its plugged in. Look for another unit!
4,Good sound,"Gave as a gift, she really loves it! Sound is very good. It's a bit smaller than I realized. The ipod touch 4 gen fits in it, but we had to take the cover off the ipod to get it to stay in the dock. Love that it charges even when in use."
2,Disappionting,My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift from her Grandmother. I suggested it after reading the reviews and thought it was a good purchase for the price. Well we just plugged it in and the sound is very 'tinny' like a transistor radio. I just called Amazon for a return shipping lable and store credit. Boo. The search continues.
2,"Portable speaker, not charger","I bought this for my wife, who wanted a portable speaker system to go with her iPod. Great, as far as portable speakers go. The connector on the dock broke loose within a week (not dropped, just broken). The speakers still work, but she has to jiggle the connector, which cuts out easily, and it will not recharge her iPod."
2,poor sound,"Good: it works easily, and the refund process worked wellBad: the sound is tinny, like a 1970s transistor radio. I would have expected a product of this quality to sell for $15, but maybe I'm out of touch."
4,Enjoy it!,"Our ipod dock is used mainly in the bedroom/bath area of our home. It is usually cranked up while we get ready for work in the morning. Can't complain about too much on this docking station...the volume is loud, all of our ipods sit properly without adapters and it is small enough to move around to other rooms, if necessary. I like that the ipod charges while in the docking station....can't tell you how many times I've gone to use my ipod and it's dead! Not anymore!! =) The cord is a bit short, but we manage.Overall, a great addition for us."
4,Not perfect but good enough.,"I use it for listening to podcasts and spotify on my phone. I like that its portable, with good volume, and can be used with batteries when a plug isn't convenient. I don't like that the dock includes a port that doesn't fit my phone, a bag full of other port thingies came with it but none of those fit my phone either (they are for ipods mostly). It's not a deal breaker, my phone just kind of sits awkwardly on the dock, leaning onto the machine with a wire plugged into the headphone jack connecting it to the speakers, but for five stars it would ideally fit perfectly."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"My poor 11 year old daughter was disappointed not once, but twice, with this product. I bought her one for her birthday; it worked for one day. She liked it for the few hours it was working, though, so I exchanged it for her. Amazon was wonderful and shipped a replacement the next day. This one we were even more gentle with; it worked for 2 hours! She is very disappointed. This item has to have the worst quality control ever. i have been purchasing electronics from Amazon for over 10 years and have never had such lemons! BUYER BEWARE!"
2,poor quality,"I bought this for my 13 year old son and it lasted for a little over a month, he went to remove it off the dock and the piece that fits in to the Ipod broke off. He is not a 2 year old that does not take ease when using his electronics and for it to break off so easily I feel was not properly made for the price that is being asked. I thought if I spent more money, better quality, this is not the case with this product. I would not suggest it for a teenager or anyone else for that matter."
4,For the price I have no complaints,"I purchased this for one of my wife's birthday presents after looking around at other products, reading some reviews here and there, finally settling on this one. While she hasn't used it yet, I was kinda curious so I got it out of the box and popped my ipod on the dock and for something so small, it sounded fine.If you're looking for something to put on a bedstand, desk at work, etc. this should suit your purposes fine. The iPods used on it are the 5th Gen 120gb HD versions, should you wonder which ipod(s)was used."
3,"decent sound and value, but weak docking interface","I like the look, sound quality, and portability of the speakers. However, the dock interface became loose to my iPod nano within a few months, despite using the correct insert. It now plays the music, but does not charge the iPod. Pretty soon, I'll have to use a cord to connect..."
4,2nd one was fine.,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas. I was a little surprised by the small size, but the sound quality was great for such a small item. She only uses it in her bedroom, so it worked out great, but it could be used in a much larger room. She hooked up her iPod touch, and the only problem was when she tried to skip a song. Playing normally, everything was fine. When she skipped a song, the speakers stopped playing and the only sound was coming out of her iPod. She was willing to put up with that, but then a few days later a thumping sound came from the speakers. We decided to return it (which was INCREDIBLY easy) and her new one works great. I think I'm going to get one for myself. Great value for the money spent."
3,Could have been better...,"The speakers are not maqnetically shielded. It produces static sounds when its near mobile phones. The cradle is not deep enough for the Itouch, you will need to remove any casing or covers you had with your Itouch to get it to work and connected. For the price, they perform better than any of the Ipod/Itouch speakers available in the market. *** Good!"
5,Excellent for the Money,"I bought this item after researching many other ones. Believe me I researched a lot of them. After reviewing many of the comments on this product and many others, I decided to take my chances. I am very glad I decided on this one. It works great. Very functional. Sound is excellent. I used it outside at a birthday party and the sound was great and plenty loud. I like that it has many adapters for different types of Ipods. This is great incase you ever get a new Ipod. This one does not have the clock or the remote as some of the other do. I really do not find that you need a clock though. Remote would have been nice but for the price I am pretty happy. The only thing that I did not like was it does look really plastic (kinda cheap) but again for the price you really can't beat it. Also another plus is you can use this with double A batteries."
4,great purchase,"Very good purchase. Happy with it! I think it has excellent sound quality for the price and even can compete with more expensive alternatives. I am sure there are some products with much better sound quality, but if not willing or able to spend more than $200+ I would recommend this!!"
3,Couldn't dock iPod Touch 4G,"No matter how I tried, I just couldn't get the dock connector to go into my iPod Touch 4G. The connector just didn't fit the Touch. However, my iPod Nano 5G and my wife's iPod Classic did both went into the dock with no problems.So why did I give it 3 stars instead of 1? The sound is surprisingly good for such a small and inexpensive device, especially the bass (for its size). I will just use it with my iPod Nano 5G and my wife's iPod Classic and use the aux input on the rare occasions when I want to use it with my iPod Touch 4G."
4,Excellent product!,"This is an excellent product! It charges your iPod & allows you to hear your songs at a much louder volume. The sound quality is excellent! I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because it would be nice if it came with a remote control, as most players of this type do. Regardless, the quality of this product far exceeds the price you pay.UPDATE: I bought a second unit for another room in my house, & it did not work the same. The connection to the IPod was not as good. I have to struggle with the second unit to get the music to play, even though the first one still works well. Also, if you set your alarm & place your IPod on this charger, it doesn't always work."
4,sweet little portable speakers!,"No incredi-bass, but pleasant sounding speakers for outdoors or use in a space where big speakers are awkward. Have this currently perched on my kitchen windowsill, ready to be transported outside at a moment's notice. Really enjoy the sound quality, especially at this price point! I'm very happy with the purchase.Follow up: after enjoying this speaker system for over a year, I decided to purchase another for a trip to northern Michigan. I wanted to easily travel in a rental car, and listen to my ipod. The speakers handily sat on the dashboard, and provided excellent sound, including nice base. We then used the system inside at home as well.The fact that it works on batteries, charged ipods, and comes with the ac adapter really complements the awesome sound. This is a great purchase for the average listening situation, and did I mention the price point is sweet?"
4,love it but wish is was a little more portable.,I love everything about this product except that it doesn't pack up nice and tight to be thrown into a back pack and take off. I am looking for a more compact model to be able to zip up (with ipod in it) and go. Need it for excursions and work. Don't want to leave that hanging around! But I love it around the house and can easily transfer it from room to room or outside when we have guests. Oh and it gets pretty loud if you like it that way and sounds great!
4,Great for the price.,"This doesn't sound near as good as my Klipsch, but it is for my daughter and it is really not bad. It is fairly compact and feels pretty solid. I would buy it again."
5,big sound little space,bought this for my husband he likes it very much but now we listen to music while wacthing tv with no sound
2,Not happy with this speaker set,"I'm afraid I got a bad unit or something but I was unhappy with this small speaker dock. I have an iPod Touch and I could not get the unit to charge the iPod. It comes with several cradles to fit all types of iPods but although I tried several I could not get my iPod to seat properly for charging. Also, the sound was very crackly at times so I think there may be short there. I need a small speaker and charging dock for my iPod just for a few hours in the morning and I typically listen to audiobooks not music, but the sound, when not crackly, was muddy and low. I had purchased this unit to replace a Logitech that was much larger. I had really hoped this would be perfect, but alas it has to go back. Although I think I may have just received a lemon I'm not going to get another one and back to the search.AMAZON.com. I will say, however, that Amazon.com has superb customer service, with no problems whatsoever in returning for refund. This is why I love Amazon so much!"
4,Great value,"This docking station is great, just what I wanted! The operation is easy, it plays my ipod touch no problem and the sound is pretty darn good, much better than I expected for the price. If you are looking for a station to charge your mp3 player and produce great sound at a very good price then your search has ended."
2,Guess I got a lemon...,Worked okay for a very short period of time...Unit quit working after about 60 days.Not real happy with this purchase.
1,I Give Up!,"I was looking for a small iPod player with a fuller sound for my iTouch in the kitchen counter area and on trips. Previous purchases included a iLive IBCD2817 (thin sound) and a Klipsch iGroove SXT (too bulky, especially with the power brick).The Cyber Acoustics appeared at first to be the answer. Very compact and with an amazingly rich sound, which was initially great for both music, podcasts and wifi radio.But then the buzzing, crackling and static started and it didn't matter which outlet it was plugged into (I tried it both at work and home).I thought it may have been a defect in the one unit, but after returning it and receiving a replacement the same problem occurred again. So frustrating!Amazon has been great about the returns and sadly the second unit will be shipped back tomorrow for credit."
1,Disappointment,"I was extremely hopeful when I ordered this proudct, due to the many 5 star ratings it has received. I was a bit taken back at how tiny and low-end this device was when it arrived (I currently own 2 iHome docking stations). The problem that ultimately ended in me returning the device for a refund was the static noise coming from the speakers -whether the iPod was on it or not. It sounded as though there was an electrical short in the wiring and it made me a bit nervous. I thought about getting it replaced, but after reading some of the other 1 star reviews I elected to ask for a refund. I'll be purchasing something from another company all together. Do yourself a favor, and keep looking!"
4,Will not charge ipod Nano 3rd generation!,"Great dock for a good price with great sound. Nice-sized unit for the kitchen counter, bathroom or office desk. But be aware that this unit will play but CANNOT charge your 3rd generation ipod (4GB & 8GB)or the ipod Shuffle- apparently they use a higher voltage. Will charge all the others. So if you want your ipod charged when you take it off this unit & head out the door, you'll have to go with a more expensive unit like Cyber Acoustics model 491."
1,This is JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I went through three of these, and ALL of them spewed static - the third one before I'd even attached an iPod. I ended up purchasing an iHome, but I have yet to test it out.I have NO idea how this has garnered so many positive reviews, when it's so badly made. It will randomly spew out high-pitched static, and I can't describe how annoying this is. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this piece of junk."
1,"Good idea, but didn't work for long",I was in love with this product for the first month. After a couple of minutes the speakers just started producing static. It hasn't worked the same since. Next time I guess I'll have to spend a little more money:(
4,Does the Job but will not dock newer models,"This product works just fine. The sounds quality is nice and it is easy to use. I purchaged it because it has the highest review on Amazon.com for the price range. My issue is that I have an Ipod touch 4th generation but the Ipod will not dock on the unit. However, the unit does come with a wire that I can hook into the back and then hook into the Ipod. This works fine and it also works well with my other MP3 payers. I only got this unit to incrase the volume of my Ipod so it suits my needs. However, it will not charge the unit. I do have an Ipod Classic and that unit will dock. If I had read more I probably would have noticed this. But is it is no big deal. I just wanted to throw that in."
1,Doesn't fit,"This unit does not fit the iPod Touch 4g. The correct ""cradle"" is included, but the actual connection pin does not insert properly into the iPod Touch 4g. No connection, no playback, no charge. The auxiliary cable included with the unit does work, and the speakers sound very nice. But, the unit does not charge the iPod that way. I've returned it."
4,Bargain Ipod player,"This device is much lower cost than other choices. It works fine - sound quality about what you'd expect from a small radio. Not elegant looking but wholly satisfactory for audio book listening, and very easy to use.Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker for iPod (Black)"
5,luv it!,great sound and very portable. I use it to play music in my sons nursdery. Charges ipod while using it
2,Not worth the money,This ipod player is really junk. It is very small and cheaply built. It arrived defective and would only play on battery power. When plugged in it made loud popping noises and locked up the ipod. Even without it being defective I would give it a low rating due to sound quality and no features.
3,Not Bad but Not Perfect,"I received this item recently and was drawn to the compactness of the unit. Although several inserts are included for any type of iPod, my iPod Video (classic style and size), did not fit well in the adaptor. Without the adaptor, it works fine. The highs and middle tones sound great. The bottom tones are distorted and lack a well rounded sound. Okay for the money but I think a good set of comparably priced computer speakers would work better."
1,Could Potentially Damage iPod,"The metal docking plug of this Cyber Acoustics docking speaker did not fit smoothly into my iPod Touch (1st gen). I had to forcibly jam them together to make them fit. Removing the iPod also took quite a bit of force.I was concerned that repeatedly forcing my iPod into the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker would damage the iPod. So I returned the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker to Amazon.If a docking speaker is designed correctly, an iPod should fit into it quite smoothly. I have previously fit my iPod into other types of docking speakers, and the fit was always smooth.The problem here was not with the plastic adaptor (for the iPod Touch) supplied with the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker. My iPod Touch fit easily into that adaptor. Rather, the problem was with the metal docking plug, which failed to fit smoothly, with or without the adaptor."
2,Works at first.....,"I got this iPod speaker dock in and plugged it right up and worked great! I probably used this 4-5x a week. Last time I used it it worked fine and now when I try and play something through it, it just skips horribly and makes a buzzing sound and will not come on. I have had this total for about a 1.5 months. Of course its 10 days past returning date!I would NOT recommend this at all!! It initially worked great then broke instantly! If after reading the other reviews you still want to get it, don't leave a review until after using this for along time!"
5,Great Sound,"Love these little speakers. This is actually my second set. My boss gave me this same speaker dock for my birthday to put on my desk. It had such a great sound, I went home and ordered one for my kitchen. Set up in about 2 minutes."
2,Broke after 6 weeks,"This speaker worked just fine when we first opened it. 6 weeks later it only sporadically plays music, and no longer charges the iPod. Of course, it also broke right after the window closed for returns. I recommend spending a little more and getting a speaker that is reliable."
5,Love it!,"I love that 2 years later I still have it and it works wonderfully! Fit's all kinds of different IPOD's and IPhone's. volume is great, gets high enough to hear in other rooms.Really great product for a great price!"
4,Works nicely,It charges up and plays an iPod Touch just fine. Sound quality is pretty decent for such a small package. I would recommend it.
2,Buzzing sound,Item buzzes after just a few months of use...I never turned it up loud due to the fact that I use it at work...after all the good reviews I thought I had made a good purchase..I guess not...
4,Compatible with iPod Nano 6th generation but inadequate sound quality,"The description said that it would contain a specific docking port for each type of iPod, whether it be classic, touch, or nano. My kit contained two docks for the iPod classic and one port for a iPod Nano 4th generation. However, my iPod Nano 6th generation (it's the smallest one that's a square with a touch screen) fits and plays while simultaneously charging it. It was a little confusing that it contained an auxiliary cable, which you don't need. It has a nice compact size so it fits nicely anywhere (I use mine in the bathroom) and is easy to travel with.As far as sound quality is concerned, yes it has adequate bass. But the sound is not balanced properly and often the melody and sometimes the singers voice gets lost or hard to heard."
3,"It's Ok, not great!","I did not do any research on this; didn't even find out if it had a remote control. It doesn't. It is the basic speaker dock for iPods and MP3's. Simple to operate, sound is OK, volume is limited but adequate for what I need for listening to books. It has changeable ""docker plates"" for the different iPod--this is abit cumbesome if you have more than one style iPod you listen to. The original iPod Classic does not fit in any of the ""plates"". I was able to listen to mine by removing the plates and setting the iPod right on the pins (sorry, don't know whjat it is called)."
4,"No dance party, but good sound","We got this for my son's room, and it's great! We have a Bose system -- which is great for a loud party, but this product couldn't handle a lot of other room noise.Still, for the price, it's great to have in a bedroom or kitchen.We've owned it since 2009 and have not had a problem with it."
3,Construction probs,"IT sounds fine; great for it's size. But I had a hard time opening the back to insert batteries and now the back won't click in place and stay closed. So I taped It together and it works fine; I just can't fold it up like before. I also bought and second one, white, for about 2 dollars. And it has no problems. However, it is constructed to hold an iPhone vertically without the iPhone cover that most people have. But again, easy to compensate for if you don't mind it slightly cockeyed."
4,Great Sound! Compact and light.,"This is my first docking station and well worth the money. I think it has superb sound and is very light. It can be used with batteries or cord and when the AC cord is used it will charge your classic ipod. I find a wide range of volume and very full sound. It comes with a rather useless bag for carrying it, the bag will offer almost no protection except for the lightest scratches and certainly no protection from any bumps.The sound is so good, though, that I'm purchasing a second one so I have one for the office and one for home so I don't have to worry about transporting it!"
5,Really GREAT for the price and the size,"Honestly, I never write reviews, but this little thing deserves one.. I was really just looking for something that I could take on trips.. Something that would pack easily with my luggage, and this thing satisfies! It's very small, but don't let that fool you. For being so small, I really can't believe the good sound it produces.. The battery feature is great, so you can bring it down by the pool at a hotel! It was supposed to be just for trips, but I find myself jammin' this thing in my living room at home! Great product for the price! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a cheap alternative to the super expensive Bose system."
1,Terrible device,"Here are the issues:sound quality is awful.if you're device has wireless, there will be interference. If you enter the room with any device that has wireless, the dock will emit a horrible static and beeping sound. If your mobile device is in the hall, same will happen.The operation lights are blue and red. Which is on and which is off? I have to keep checking the manual.Most of the time, you have to jiggle your ipod in the dock to make the connection so that the device plays.We've had this dock for 8 months before it broke.Bad technology! I'm sure there's better out there."
1,Worked for one year,"Bought this because of the price. You get what you pay for. Worked OK for about one full year - now it will not play or charge the ipod at all. Checked the adapter and appears to be something wrong with the computer chip that the ipod sits on. Next time, I will pay a little more and get something better."
2,Nearly $40 for this?,"The product itself is ""ok"". If you are looking for something that plays close to you, like while you cook, sit at your desk, lying in bed, etc. But if uwanted something to sit on a ledge while your swimming or gardening, the sound just doesn't do it. So, since I wanted this item for the latter, for my desires and purposes, it just wasn't worth it for $40. I'd rather have spent $30 morre to get what I want and needed. It's a decent player and it does charge your iPod while hooked up and it comes w/ several hookup deals for different kinds of iPods... It just wasn't worth $40 to me."
1,cyber acoustics portable speakers,"Bought this for my bedroom, to charge at night and occasionally play music..... well, I'm very disappointed, you cant keep it turned on at night because of the bright blue light(actually lights up the room) and it interferes with other devices, so it makes a buzzing sound. As far as sound, it's great for low music, but when you turn up the volume it becomes distorted. I bought this because of all the great reviews, but I am extremely disappointed and currently looking for another set of speakers."
1,Didn't work for me,"This device didn't work for me, it had 2 fatal flaws. First, it generated continuous screeching background noise from one of the speakers. Second, in the vicinity of a blackberry it produced an amplified version of the infamous ""blackberry buzz"". I had to return it and ordered another similar device from Amazon, GoGroove AudioFlip+, which works fine."
1,Do not wast your money.,"I got this to go with an iPod Touch I got my wife for her birthday. We chose this one because of its size and portability.When it arrived we where sorely disappointed. The sound was just OK when I could get it to work. That is the big issue, it is very difficult to get the iPod to connect and play music. (It will not connect with any protective case on the iPod.) When I could get it to connect, it was very touchy. Try to change songs and you dislodge it enough to stop the music from playing over the speakers."
2,Noisey,"I wanted this for my office. It didn't need to be high powered.It seems like it has plenty of power. Sound is good for what it is. The problem is with an iPhone in it, whether it is on of off, it periodically takes off making a bunch of noise, sounds like morse-code, for about 5 seconds. Truely an annoying noise. It does it at a rather high volume also. Volume setting doesn't effect it. It happens randomly, sometimes never, sometimes many times in an hour. usually always daily.I think it has something to do with the cell interaction. Might work fine for just an iPod."
5,Very Good Sound Quality,As others have said - very good sound quality for such a small set of speakers. A great price too!
2,WARNING: Dock connector pin breaks very easily,"The dock connector pin broke after 2 weeks. This must be a common occurrence, because the user's guide states that the warranty does not cover damage to the docking pin.The problem: to connect an Ipod (Touch 4) to the dock, you must place the ipod above the connector and press down hard to get the docking pin to connect. Because the ipod is so narrow, it easily slips and gets wedged in between the docking pin and the device. After this happened 2 or 3 times the docking pin no longer works.It's a shame, because many other aspects are useful: it's very small, inexpensive, easy to use and gives OK sound for its size. As it is, this should be regarded as an external speaker for an ipod or other MP3. After the docking pin breaks, it can still be used by plugging in the ipod to the audio jack. (This plays music but does not charge the ipod.)Customers should be warned that the docking pin will likely break."
5,"Great compact size and sound, keeps iPod charged","I bought this to listen to music while I exercise on my Gazelle that I also recently bought. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned it would also charge my 3rd generation nano iPod, as the manual that came with it said it wouldn't charge it. I can now leave my iPod plugged into the dock and play it whenever I want. The sound quality is better than my computer which has good speakers and 100x better than the crummy little cheap porable speaker system I bought. It is easy to turn off/on and adjust volume. The size is compact and fits easily on my desk. It comes with a bag and can operate on batteries for portability, but I wanted a small but good speaker system to keep plugged into an electrical outlet to use whenever I work out."
3,"Cheap, OK dock","It is what you would expect for a ~$30 dock. The sound is far from good and there's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity. Volume level is OK. material is on the cheap side. I was expecting more based on the rest of the comments but I guess for ~$30 is ""OK"""
3,A Good Value Option,"Bought these speakers to replace a set from Altec Lansing (iM3) which I've since worn out. The sound quality is decent, but is noticeably inferior to the higher-priced Altec Lansing (iM3) or JBL alternatives.I also can't help but compare these speakers' design with that of the iM3, which neatly folds into a compact book shape - which is easy to tuck into a bag. These speakers have a carrying pouch as well, but the shape of the product isn't as compact as my previous set.Finally, I have to note that the plastic used for the product's body looks and seems cheap. At around $30, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Docking staion disappointment,"Purchased this docking station for my granddaughter, based upon other reviews. I realize that the product itself did NOT say that it was Phase IV compatible,(but it also did not say that it WASN'T compatible) but a lot of the reviews stated that it worked for them...well, not for me. Although the speaker quality is fine, it will not fit any of the adapters for the iPod IV and therefore it cannot charge the device. That is a major disappointment, but it was only $32.00, so I can't gripe too loudly, I guess."
3,"Good buy, for the price.","Just wanted something simple and easy for the baby's room to play lullaby music on the iPod. Sound is not fantastic, but I've heard much worse out of higher priced items. If you want something basic, but don't want to spend a lot of cash, this fits the bill just fine. No complaints here!"
1,Whining/Buzzing first time out of the box,"As soon as I plugged this speaker in, it started buzzing. I didn't even attach an iPod to it yet. The buzzing is loud and annoying and gets more high pitched when you do plug the iPod in. Sending this back to Amazon for a refund. I can only imagine that if some units do this right away out of the box then the construction of these things is flimsy and I wouldn't trust a replacement to last long even if it worked at first! Frustrating, as I really like the size and look of these speakers and the sound minus the whining/buzzing sound seemed pretty decent for my purposes."
1,ac adapter is missing,I love the product but the ac adapter is missing. Don't know how to contact the sender about this so leaving message here.
1,Broke in a month,"The very first time I docked my ipad, I winced. Within a month I could feel the connector coming apart from the unit. I just hope this thing didn't screw up the connections on my ipod. I'm freshly reminded why I don't normally buy the cheapest thing I can find."
5,More for the Money!,This is a very good sound base for your Ipod. It has really unexpected sound quality for it's size. I would definitely recommend this product!
1,Dont quite understand the positive reviews here,"This product cant be played above a whisper without the speakers distorting. Unless I got a faulty product, these positive reviews are from family members of the cyber accoustics people."
1,One word- distortion,"I thought I had done lots of research before I purchased this speaker set, but obviously not enough. The set was, as others had mentioned, smaller than I had imagined, but did not put out the sound as some were raving about. I purchased these to use on a patio boat for 4th of July so I needed some volume and since I am quite picky about the tone and the sound, I wanted something with a little bass. Every time I turned it up to get any sort of volume the speakers went into cardiac arrest and made this horrible growling sound. I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I check all the connections and tried it again twice with the same results. Don't waste your money on this."
1,purchase completed way before the submit button appeared,"unit returned without opening.There was no way to stop this purchase which was never submitted.It does not seem to be a computer error, but rather done on purpose by the seller.I am surprise Amazon would deal with this seller."
1,Awful sound,This product sounds extremely tinny and crackling. Truly a poor product even at lower volumes. I do not recommend this for any use. This was supposed to be for my daughter's dorm room.
1,Piece of junk,It broke in only two weeks. It didn't work well from the start and half the time didn't recognize my iPod. Waste of 40 dollars..
1,Broke in 90 days,"I purchased this speaker dock for my office. I have never moved it off my desk and have used it sparingly. It stopped working a week ago. It sounded good while it worked, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,DOES NOT LAST,This worked fabulously for a little less than two months... then it just stopped. The speakers no longer work. VERY disappointed.
5,Great sound for the price!,"Was greatly impressed with this little speaker system. Has good quality sound and bass doesn't get distorted, even on lower quality mp3 files. Would highly recommend this purchase if your shopping on a budget."
5,Outstanding sound.....Impressed,Using this for an IPOD Nano 16 gig and classic 80 gig. Was impressed by the sound. The aux port is an additional bonus. I work remotely so I use this in the office and I love the dual functionality.Recommend it highly.
4,Decent speakers,"I bought this a while back going on all the positive reviews and wanted something relatively cheap. It has definitely served it purpose. It charges my iTouch 4th generation almost perfectly with the exception of a couple times where it didn't recognize it, all I had to do was take it off and put it back on though. The sound quality is good, better than I expected. The only thing I have against this is that the power button on the top quit working after a month or two. The volume buttons still work fine though. Overall, good price for a good little speaker system and convenient to carry around."
1,Works OK while it lasts,"Bought June 2011, by Mar 2012 it has already stopped working. It's small and convenient just hope they make it more reliable."
2,Worked well til it broke!,"Well, it worked very well and I was pleased with the speakers until about a month later, when first it stopped playing music on the nano, and then it stopped charging my old school ipod. Now I have to put a small bottle behind the ipod in order to get the wires/electronics to work so that it'll play. So, for 40 bucks, Im pretty disappointed, but *shrug* c'est la vie. Buy at your own risk!"
4,Satisfied with Docking Speaker for iPod,"Very satisified with the quality, for the price. It isn't a BOSE, but it is good for listening to lectures on my iPod. Easy to move from place to place. I haven't tried it using batteries yet."
2,sounds good but stopped working,"This set is used by adults. The speakers work fine, but the dock no longer works. Only worked for about 7 months. Not a good product."
4,"Could be worse, Could be better","For the price, don't expect more! You get a small black portable speaker system that plays your devices, won't play iPhones but thats ok because it has the extra cable to do that with just like you would in your car. Music distorts if you turn it too loud but its not horrible! Im happy i have it, happy i didn't spend more money on it than i did, i would recommend it for a person who's looking to set it up in one room and not for friends and family kind of entertainment."
2,not impressed,"I wanted to like this little docking speaker for its size and price and ordered it because of all the great reviews. But honestly, I really can't say anything good about the sound quality and wonder how anyone could be satisfied with the sound of this unit. (Yes, I have tried adjusting the equalizer) Tinny, shallow, raspy sound - it doesn't even sound as good as my Phillips kitchen radio! I am a classical musician, but hardly an audiophile. I definitely would not recommend this product. I gave it two stars to be fair - it was low priced and maybe you just get what you pay for."
1,Keep looking.,"This just didn't have the minimal volume power I was hoping for, and I wasn't hoping for much. I wanted something I could have outside with me, right next to me, on the deck. The sound just gets lost in the air with the sound of the outdoors. I was going to give it to one of my kids, and then last week when we plugged it in, it made a funny ""pop!"" and then we smelled a little electrical smoke smell and then it didn't work anymore. So, I would recommend you keep looking - perhaps spend a little more money. I may have got what I paid for but still, it should have lasted longer."
1,Look for something else,"I was thoroughly disappointed after receiving this product. Sound quality was very poor. The speakers rumbled and whined at very low volumes. It is easy to use and portable, but that doesn't make up for the poor sound. Was this a lemon? I don't know, but I had to return it and I am looking at some other options. The volume reduction switch was also sticky and difficult to work with."
3,Cradle is not very good,I've had this for about a month now. It sounds fine for the size. The battery life is excellent. My only complaint about this is the dock is poor. I have to wiggle my ipod touch to get it to connect and then sometimes it will just disconnect without even touching it. You have to wiggle it again and it will start playing again. It works fine if you use the 3.5mm cord that comes with it. Do not buy just for the dock feature.
5,A Nice Little Surprise,"I bought these speakers because I wanted a set of speakers that my iPods docked directly into, and I didn't want to spend $100, which is the price at which many iPod docking speaker systems start. I didn't expect much in sound quality, and while these speakers would never be confused with a set of $500 Bose speakers, they more than fill up a decent size room. I was honestly surrpised at the sound quality. These speakers are a great deal."
3,"It's okay, a little disappointed I think","I am usually never let down by my fellow Amazon reviewers so I went with the majority and ordered this. I wasn't expecting Bose sound or anything but I did want something a bit louder than what I got. This is a small unit and it does not play so loud. It's not bad at all, cute but I did want something louder. I guess I set my sights too high.I will keep it and use it for the kitchen."
1,Disposable electronics,"We've had this product for less than ten months. Although it worked well and met our needs (iPhone/iPod docking in the kitchen) for six or seven months, it now doesn't work at all. For a while we had to wedge a piece of folded paper between device and docking station, close to the pins, to get a connection but that only worked briefly. Now it won't connect at all. The sound quality wasn't great but was fine for a small room. Its a shame that the pins just wore out. I suppose this is the age of disposable electronics but I expect a fifty dollar item to last longer than ten months...."
1,"Nice, but cheap...","Bought this speaker for my daughter's iPod because it was a nice blend of size and price. The connector lasted ONE week, and of course, it's the one component not covered in the ""limited"" warranty. It's a bad design-- docking puts too much torque on the weakly supported base even with the proper adapter in place. We can still use the cable for the speakers and the sound is fine for its size. However, if you can't charge the device, it's not worth much."
1,Pass on this item ...,This item worked great for 2 months ... then right after the time to return it stops working.The place to plug your iPod in has a flimsy connector piece. It stops recognizing and charging your unit.
3,"Worked great, then it broke","We were really pleased with this, the sound quality was great. We used it primarily in our kids room to play music while they slept. Then we started noticing that it wasn't charging well. It was extremely sensitive as to how the iPod was placed on the stand. Now it isn't playing at all. It appears that the dock has broken off inside somehow. I've had the unit just over two months - gonna have to find something different now."
4,Fantastic!,"These speakers were everything they were described as and perfect for what I need them for, which is listening to my iPod at work on my desk. Wonderful product!"
5,Nice sound. Simple.,"Nice sound for such a small unit. Works great with my iPhone 4. It notifies me that my phone is not compatible, but it still works and still charges."
2,Save your money!,The sound on this is terrible! You could get better sound from a transistor radio! Save your money.
2,compact and good sound but not ideal for an ipod touch,"I bought this set of speakers on the strength of the reviews here and elsewhere. Unfortunately it has a major flaw in that using an ipod touch (2nd gen, in my case) with the Wifi enabled causes audible interference. CA tech support hasn't been helpful saying they're not the only manufacturer with the problem. Gee, that makes me feel better! A Belkin dock attached to a home stereo has no such issues. I was also underwhelmed by the inclusion of a docking insert for the 1st gen ipod touch rather than for the 2nd or 3rd gen - the 2nd gen has been on the market for over a year. CA's response was to tell me to buy the correct insert from Apple!So it's a good product with a flaw that limits its use with the ipod touch and has less than impressive customer service. Your mileage may vary..."
4,works great,"for the price paid this item is great. perfect to take room to room in your house or wherever you want. sound i'm sure could be better but you'd also have to pay more, to me it sounds just fine, no static or anything like that. I'm perfectly satisfied. fits our itouch and nano great."
3,"Good for small room, but lasts only few months","We needed some speakers in our kitchen, so I wanted something that didn't take up too much counter space. These speakers are compact, portable, and easy to use. Sound is pretty decent. However, the connection to the iPod stopped working after a few months. We now have to use the wired connection to the back of the speakers and lay the iPod on the counter next to them. Definitely a hassle, but you get what you pay for...meaning they are inexpensive."
4,great value for the price!,"This little ipod dock is very inexpensive, easy to use lightweight and very portable. No frills, no adjustments or remote but the sound is surprisingly good. I take it to work, outside, to the kitchen with no problem. Well worth the price!"
5,Pleasantly surprised,"Bought this for a two week driving vacation to ""the wilderness"". It worked great and sounded great!ALSO, customer service was wonderful, getting me the right size holder for my ""early generation"" ipod."
4,Great price,Sound quality is decent. Definitely a good deal. Small enough to be put just about anywhere.
3,Annoying buzzing sound!!,"This product looks good and sound good for its price. It served the purpose, BUT! there's this annoying buzzing sound which i think is comming from wi-fi or cell signal. I notice it as soon as i tried with my itouch. The buzzing sound went away after turning off my wi-fi on my itouch. Weird...i would rate this a five if it wasent from the annoying sound.Thanks"
3,Sound good but no radio interference shielding for WI-FI or Cell Phone,"The sound on this unit is very good for the price. I had no trouble using it with my iPod Touch 1st generation. The main problem I have is that I use the WI-FI on the iPod to listen to internet radio like Pandora. The speakers pick up the RF interference caused by the WI-FI and it is very loud, making it almost useless for that purpose. Also if my cell phone is near the unit, it too will interfere with the speakers. It would not take much to add the shielding. It's too bad the designers had not accounted for it."
2,Maybe I was listening to a different device than everyone else,"After reading all the glowing reviews about the great sound, I ordered this as opposed to the JBL, figuring the only thing that's missing is remote control. The sound quality is nothing to write home about. It turns out that there are no miracles, and you get what you pay for. If you're looking for an inexpensive dock that sounds better than a clock radio, but not by much, then get this. But don't think you'll be able to use this to provide music at a party, unless it's in a nursing home."
4,Nice little iPod Dock,"I bought this iPod dock about 1 year ago for my daughter's room, and it works great. I would have given it 5 stars but it does not have a remote - however it was a great price. The audio sounds good, given the size of the speakers, and it is compatible with all of my Apple iPods and iPhones (iPhone 4S or older). It does not work with the new iPhone 5 because Apple changed the connection.I may buy a second one so I can play baby music in my infant son's room on an old iPod Nano 2nd gen. I still have. The Cyber Acoustics does not take up much space on top of a night stand or dresser."
1,Horrible Quality,"The engineering on the product is abysmal. After purchasing this for my daughter for the holidays, It stopped working less than two months later. The iPod connector was loose, so I popped the thing open thinking maybe it's a loose cable connection. No! The connector (which has many very, very, small pins) was soldered directly to the board. This means every time you plug on unplug your iPod you are pulling directly on the super tiny soldered joints. Whoever engineered this needs to rethink their career choice. DO NOT purchase."
2,Don't bother,I loved this when I got it and have only used it about 20 times and the charging function has stopped working. Not very happy. It is a little flimsy compared to my old JBL2 round speaker which lasted for 3 years before breaking with daily usage.
1,Embarrassment it broke on the 2nd day!,"I couldn't believe it, I gave as a gift to my boyfriend and it sounded great the first day but the 2nd day the speakers stopped working on him, don't buy it.."
2,Good while it lasts......,"I had one of these that I used pretty regularly maybe 2-3 hrs a week for 15 months. Then, the sound faded in & out one day & never came back on. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. The bass is a little too high, so you get a lot of distortion at higher volumes. If you are looking for a cheap dock, you found it. But don't expect it to last forever. I took good care of mine and then it quit for no reason. But I guess I got my money's worth for only $35. But I will not be getting another cheap replacement."
5,Wonderful price and sound.,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she just loves it. She mainly uses while teaching yoga. I would recommend this for price and sound.
1,PRODUCT INFORMATION INCORRECT,"The informatin for this dock says it fits ALL iPOD MODELS. This is untrue. The new Nano does NOT fit in this dock. That should be noted and changed or many other people will be in the same situation I am - new Nano, no dock."
3,turn down the volume?,"I purchased this unit a few months ago and was very happy with it until it began to randomly turn the volume up to high as it was playing and would not go down. Try as I may, the volume just would not remain on low, no matter how many times I turned off the power and tried to reset it.If anyone else has encountered this problem and solved it, please let me know!"
4,CAPDDSFI,"This is a good product for indoor use. What I love about it is that has an AC connector so I don't have to use batteries, and I can plug in any type of audio device with no problem due to the 1/8 inch AUX connection. I tried plugging in the iPod Touch 4th Generation to the iPod connector, but it didn't sound louder than a whisper, but through the AUX it sounded great. The audio itself has a bit too much bass, but it is excellent for the price and makes some of my music sound impressive. Used in the kitchen- Gets loud enough-Takes up little space- easy to use- charges iPods- and a Decent price for the simple features that are hard to find in this price range."
1,not working after 4 months,"I bought this Docking speaker for my daughter. After 3 to 4 month, Her iPod could not be charged with the product any more. Very poor quality."
1,Very expensive for the short time it actually worked,"Speaker system worked fine for a month, used infrequently at most dozen times or so, and then it just quit. No music regardless the volume setting. Lights all lit but no sound. Tried using only batteries, only car plug, and tried using house converter. Nothing. iPod works great in other systems so it is not the iPod."
2,Defective,"Sending back. Worked one day only. Possibly defective AC cord...but unlikely to reorder. Nice size, good sound the one day it worked."
3,Cheap & OK Sound,For the price this is a good system. But don't expect great sound. I would say sound quality is fair. I bought for my 2.5 year old to listen to songs before bed time. It does good enough for that.
2,"Good Speakers, Wi-Fi Issues","These speakers largely work, although if I try to listen with wi-fi enabled on my iPod Touch, the speakers send a ton of static. Even if I'm not listening to music and the speakers are ""off"" there is static. Even having my phone with wi-fi enabled in close proximity (within a foot or so) will create some static. If you are using this with a nano or classic, this should be great. If you are planning on streaming Pandora through an iPod Touch or iPhone, I'd recommend getting a different set of speakers."
5,Happy with purchase,Bought for my daughter for a charger. Like the fact it wont play to loud. Price was the factor for this purchase. Satisified with this purchase. She likes it too.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"This is a great ipod speaker system for the price. I looked in stores and couldn't find a system nearly this good for cheaper or even the same price. Sounds great and is super portable. I only have one problem with it and that is this....I like to put my ipod on shuffle and just let it go. However, when you want to turn this device off completely, you have to slide the on/off button on the BACK BOTTOM of the device. If you simply push the middle button on the top (which is more accessible), all it does is MUTE the music...the ipod continues to play, you just don't hear it. When I turn the device completely off with the back bottom button and then I want to turn it back on again...I have to go back into the ipod and choose shuffle again...so no continuous play. Quite annoying. But since the cost of this was so cheap, I will deal with it."
3,Why static NOW?,"I, too, WAS impressed with the portable digital docking speakers from Cyber Acoustics, until after several months, the static began.....WHY NOW? and WHAT CAUSES? So aggravating...."
3,CYBER ACOUSTIC PORTABLE DIGITAL IPOD DOCK,I HAVE HAD THIS DOCK FOR A FEW MONTHS. VERY SIMPLE TO SET UP FOR USE. SOUND IS GOOD. EASY TO USE. IT CHARGES THE IPOD AS YOU USE IT. FOR THE MONEY A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. I WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS.
1,Should have listened to the bad reviews,"I read numerous reviews that spoke of static sound and the speakers just stop working one day. Should have listened better. I thought maybe it was just a few that were bad ... mine was one of them. I heard the static in the speakers the first day, but tried to pretend it wasn't there. After about 3 months it would not charge the ipod when it was docked, and then a few weeks later it just stopped working. The power light was on, with and without the battery/charging cord and still no sound. Should have listened!!! Junk! And I thought, ""It's only $30 dollars, if it doesn't work, at least I'm not losing that much money."" Well, there goes $30 dollars!"
1,Didn't work for ipod touch 3rd generation,"When I plugged my ipod touch 3rd generation into the Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker, no sound came out of the speakers, so I returned it (which Amazon makes relatively easy to do)."
3,Eh ..,"We bought this iPod dock/speakers mainly because it was cheap. And I guess you do get what you pay for. The sound quality is not great, when the speakers are turned on, and no music playing, there is a slight buzz/hum that it makes. It's just an average, iPod dock/speaker, probably should have spent a little more money and bought a name brand product."
3,Meh,"I bought one used (to what extent I'm not sure), and I was expecting a little more based on the reviews I had read. When the volume is up loud enough to fill a tiny room, the left speaker doesn't work. If a song has any bass in it, the system can't really handle it unless it's on very very soft. However, depending on what music you listen to, the clarity is quite nice. Just make sure it isn't too loud, and make sure you're not listening to metal or hip-hop and you should be OK. While this is an upgrade from lap top speakers, I wouldn't recommend this product if you're an audio snob."
4,Not Bad for the Price,"This is an inexpensive set of speakers to play your favorite tunes while you putter around the house. It's also an excellent way to charge your device. It works best in an average size room since when you turn it up loud, the sound distorts.I also noticed that my speakers were popping, or buzzing, whenever my ipod touch was plugged in. It was driving me crazy!! Odd that it never happened when the 3rd Generation ipod classic was plugged in. It dawned on me: the difference between the two is wifi. So, I turned off my Touch wifi and plugged it back into the speakers. No buzzing!!Im glad it wasn't a speaker defect.Al in all, this was a great purchase. I only wish I'd splurged a bit and got speakers with a remote."
4,Good little ipod speaker dock,"Not a bad little speaker dock for the iPod. We got the newest iPod nano and it fit in there perfectly and played easily. The sound is great for how tiny it is (I was surprised at how small it actually is, but that's actually a good thing for our purposes). Not the speakers I would choose for the whole house, but great for what we intended--playing the iPod in an office."
4,"Big Sound, Little Price Tag","I was looking for a small travel system for my iPod. I have the Bose system at home so yes, I have high expectations on sound quality. I have used the ihome travel speakers, but didn't like how you had to charge them. I wanted something that could run off an electrical outlet or battery, which this one does both.The sound is very good and of course it charges my iPod at the same time, so no need to pack an additional iPod charger.I was very pleased with everything about the Cyber Acoustics system except I wish it were just a little smaller and lighter. I guess you can't have everything though!I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an iPod travel system with big sound."
5,Excellent Product and Customer Service!,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased the CA 461 in April '09 for my iTouch. I was surprised how compact it was but even more pleasantly surprised by the great sound! It really was an excellent purchase. But then 4 months later, my son pulled it off the shelf and when I tried to play my iTouch again, it didn't work. I tried troubleshooting it and nothing would get the speakers to work again. I was going to order another one but I debated if I should get the iLive which was cheaper and came with a remote. But the iLive reviews were mixed and I just wasn't sure about the quality.Then I realized Cyber Acoustics offers a one-year warranty on the CA 461. So I called them up and was able to get a free replacement shipped to me! I was so thrilled!"
3,The Price Is Right !,"As John Arbuckle has said,""you only get what you pay for"".The Cyber Acoustics Docking Speaker is not a BOSE, but itis exactly what I expected for the price. It keeps my iPODcharged and allows me to listen to music while working onthe computer."
5,very good purchase,The company was very helpful when I had questions and were very professional. I would use this seller again
5,"Great Sound, Great Product, Great Price!","I bought the Cyber Acoustics Portable iPod Docking Speakers for my acupuncture practice, and I am very happy with this purchase. The unit is very small and easily fits onto the book shelf, and the sound is really quite amazing for a product that size. I read the previous reviews, and even though some weren't happy with the speaker dock, this unit seemed to have the overall best reviews for docks that were under $30.The delivery was, as usual with Amazon, right on time and very fast. It only takes a minute to set the unit up for use, and it comes with all necessary adapters to make it work for every type of iPod. I have tried it with an iPod touch 8 GB, and the old 160 GB iPod Classic, and both work flawlessly. The sound is good enough that I can hear it clearly even in the next room on only medium volume. For the price, this is an excellent product, and I can highly recommend it."
4,Didnt know wat 2 expect,"First time ordering a portable speaker, so din know wat to expect.In absolute terms, its bad. But then i have listened to JBL, Soundmagic, Bose, Apple, Klipsch, Creative, etc. So compared to them , its not gr8. But then, those are big and none are below 100$. This little thing here is just 27$, width thrice dat of my ipod touch, height 1.3-1.4 times th ipod, and about 2 inches thick, plus runs on AA batteries, which makes it extremely portable. So yes, its a pretty good deal.It comes with a lot of dock connectors, but finally, i used my apple dock connector only, it fits best. its pretty light, mostly wood i think, has decent sound quality, compared to all the tinny n metallic portable speakers i have heard. Sound is a bit too deep, soundstage is not dat gud, but the highs n mids are ok. dont expect a punchy bass n u will b ok."
4,"Good for the price, but can't go very loud","I like it because it was cheaper than a lot of other products, but one thing I wish it had was a remote, and if I put the volume all the way up, there is some vibration. And it really can't go super loud, even though it's loud enough for me when I'm in the house, it's just not going to be shaking the house! I was considering sending it back when I realized this, but for the money, it seems good enough so I decided to keep it. I hope to find one that can be louder and have a remote though."
2,"Great, while it lasted.","I received this as a Christmas present. It was exactly what I needed for my iPod Nano (6th Gen) for my desk at work. I even took it on vacation with me to use in the hotel room. Its the perfect size to fill a ""standard"" sized room at a decent volume level...I don't think its made for parties or outdoor use. Bad news is it stopped working after 6 months. No warnings, static, crackles or anything like that...just no more sound. It still functions as a charger, but you can get one of those cheaper than than this product."
5,Excellent,Received today. Packaging excellent. Sound much better than expected. Made a great buy!!Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker for iPod (Black)
1,Broken Within A Week,"Bought this as a Christmas gift and it broke within a week. There is no visible problem, it just won't play. Too late to return to Amazon so I contacted the company and they told me to ship it to them, they won't pay for a shipped label or anything. The thing was only $20 or so to begin with and I have to spend another $10 to ship it to the company, RIDICULOUS!If you don't get a defective one like mine it was a decent player. Not the best sound ever, but good for a kids room or in the garage, though not as a primary music player. Very easy to use."
1,Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker for iPod,"This product was okay at first, and after about 2 months, it sucked. It doesn't have amazing sound quality and it isn't very durable. The bass is terrible, it just vibrates and after about 2 and a half months the charger in the front broke. Then I had to use the wire which is very annoying. It is not worth the $37.00!"
4,shopperanon,"Great little bedside speaker for my iPod. Sound quality isn't amazing but it's good enough for my small bedroom. Easy to travel with as well, comes with a cloth carrying sack and all the adapters for the different versions of the iPod."
3,Did I get this wrong?,"I'm using this with a 4th generation ipod. When I read the reviews before I bought it, I thought I would be able to get FM om it. I can get it to read the station on the ipod, but no sound. Of cource it'sQUITE possible I don't know what I'm doing, but after all this fiddlin"" around I should be able to figure it out. ps the directions/instructions aren't too great. I'm not disappointed with anything else, the music sounds fine in my small bedroom and it looks nice, but my idea for taking it camping is a no-go."
1,Doesn't work,"I got this speaker as a gift a couple of years ago and it was very rarely used, but worked fine when I did use it. Recently I started using it often and it's been making this horrible static sound - very jarring and unpleasant. So I bought a new one to replace it and the new one just doesn't work at all. It worked for one day, then the next day it just wouldn't recognize the ipod. It's going back and I'm replacing it with something else. Also, it has tiny but very bright blue light that glows when it's on, which is really annoying in a dark room. The light is in a spot that makes it hard to cover too. I really don't recommend this speaker."
2,Okay for a while,"This worked okay for a while and then would turn on but no longer worked as a ""speaker"". It would also get a lot of interference when there was anything else electronic around it."
5,"works great, good volume","So far I have been using this for a week now and it is working great. I use it nightly to play ""white noise"" all night long, the volume is perfect for what I wanted, which helps me to sleep better."
1,piece of junk,"Worked okay at first, although the sound wasn't great, it was a nice little dock and speaker. Whenever a cell phone was placed within 3 feet of it it would produce a lot of static. Then, it would play through the speaker, but not charge the ipod. Now it does neither. Disappointing, I'll stay away from this brand in the future."
1,Disappointed in the End,"I bought two of these for Christmas last year at a good price. One just stopped working and the other, the a/c adapter stopped working. So.....for double what I paid and more expensive than regular price, I purchased one working unit. Oddly the working unit is the one that was dropped and cracked."
2,Doesn't fit every ipod like it claims,"Like other reviewers have observed, it does not have a dock for some ipod nanos. I'm still using it and I'm trying to be very careful with it so that it doesn't break my ipod. I should've just returned it but it's too late now.As for the playing part, it has pretty good clarity and good volume.They should fix their information on here so that they don't claim it can dock all ipods."
5,Great for the price!,This little dock is wonderful! I use it at work and the sound quality is excellent. Granted I don't turn it up loud. So I can't guarantee it sounds good at high volumes. But it's perfect for the office. I turn it up to a decent level on a quiet day in the office and it still sounds good.
5,"Looks good, sounds great, does all that is required",I was looking for something cheap to listen to podcasts while I was working in the garage. This thing plays loudly with no apparent distortion. Very well designed with digital volume control. Recharged my iTouch in less than an hour. At the present it has adapters for all iPods regardless of what the descriptions may say. Had I paid twice as much I would have still regarded it as a bargain.
2,Not Very Robust,This product would be fine if one played it at low volume all the time without moving the unit.I used this in a work environment that had a some ambient noise which required higher volume and I moved the unit around a lot. The dock often failed to charge the ipod and even seemed to drain it. The sound quality deteriorated over time. Distortion is much higher after about 6 months use. There is an intermittent hissing noise that affects the speakers. All in all I am disappointed.
2,One Month and it's already defective,"Ordered this Apr/08. It's now 1st week of Jun/08 and it's already defective. The screen of my ipod just shows a white screen when I insert the unit in this dock station. It's a pity, the sound is satisfactory but with a blank screen how can I see what to play or what is playing."
2,"It works great, until it shorts out.","I really loved this product for a few months. Then it started shorting out, or something. It makes a buzzing noise. Now I will need to throw it away."
3,Needs a remote,"Everything about the docking station is great--sound quality, appearance, price. Only one complaint: I would not purchase another one because I really miss the remote!"
5,So pleased!,"I about drove myself crazy trying to find the best-for-the-money speakers. I was willing to spend more. I couldn't make up my mind, though, so I finally chose one of the least expensive that still had good reviews. I have been VERY happy. The sound is great, and it is a terrific value."
3,Doesn't do all it says,Sounds good and easy to transport BUT it does not charge my ipod (maybe mine is defective) and it is often hard to get the ipod on as it takes alot of wiggling and jiggling to get it on properly.
2,Good for a few months,"I bought this at the end of August and was really pleased with how it worked. I wasn't looking for something super fancy; just a decent dock with speakers. But now, after three months of putting my iPhone on and taking it off the charger, that piece is starting to wiggle. I have to take my phone on and off the dock multiple times before it stays on charge. I can never be sure if I'll wake up to a fully charged phone. What a disappointment :("
2,If only.,This would have been a great value if only it had not been staticy. Hard to enjoy music with pulses of static interferring.
4,good for basic use,Looks good and basically sounds good - used it for a party and at high volume on both ipod and machine had a slight buz - just had to back it off a bit and it was fine.
2,Junk,"If these speakers played like they are suppose to every time, I would give them 5 stars. They are inexpensive, charge your iPod, and sound pretty good. Unfortunately, they almost always produce a crackling static sound when the iPod is plugged in, whether it is playing music or not. I returned these and got the Altec Lansings for $20 more and could not be happier."
5,Good!,"Everything is perfect the sound quality to style and everything is just great, only thing I didnt like was it was a little bit too pricey since im still a student!"
2,Don't expect much,"I'm going to keep this short and simple. I bought this item based on price and review, and I thought ""wow"" such a great system for only $37.00. These speakers are week and I'm struggling to hear the music in the shower which is why I bought it. It looks like I'm going to have to spend some real money to get something decent."
1,Fried my ipod,"I was thrilled at first, as the size was right and the sound was good. I left my Nano 3 generation (yes in the correct insert) on it for about an hour. When I removed my ipod it was frozen. I went to itunes and restored the original settings-----still frozen. I think this thing has killed my 5 month old ipod. I am just disgusted. Read all the reviews before I made my purchase, and thought this would be perfect for travel. Now I have to purchase a new ipod.BE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBILITY!!!!!"
2,"Not designed for iPhone 3G, has issues","I bought this to use with my iPhone 3G, but when you plug it in, the 3G displays a message that the product is not designed to work with the iPhone, and asks if you want to enable airplane mode to avoid interference.After you dismiss the dialog, the unit will charge and the speakers will work - the problem is, whenever your phone sends or receives from a cell tower, the interference is mind-boggling loud and overpowers whatever is on the speakers - it is truly unusable when the cell service is on.If you put it in airplane mode the unit works as advertised."
1,Had to return this one!,"I hae two major complaints about this item. First, my Ipod Touch 2nd Generation did not fit in the adaptor very well. I had to push down very hard for it to work, but then it wouldn't stay seated if I let go. Second, the speaker sound was terrible. The volume wasn't very loud and the speakers sounded like they were blown.The only positive thing I have to say is that it was very easy to process the return through Amazon."
3,Help Please,"I ordered two Cyber Acoustics 30 pin iPod Speaker Docks CA-461 for Christmas presents. We can not get sound to come out of the speakers with either one. We are using the right connector for Ipod touch. It charges the Ipod just fine.Help me someone, if you can because I doubt if I received two defective products. Is there something that has to be changed on the Ipod itself to make it work. We tried several songs.Thanks"
3,Cyber Digital Dock,"I thought that it would be a much bigger unit, however, the sound quality is OK for the size. There is one problem where the unit is putting out some odd noises when I had my iTouch connected. When I had another ipod connected, I didn't have that problem. So I don't know if it's my docking station or the unit connected that's causing a problem. Also, all the assorted plastic docking bases are a pain to put in and out if your switching different units."
5,Great sounding little bugger,"This is my first iPod deck ever and I believe it was money well spent. I read a lot of reviews on iPod docks, and liked what others had to say about this particular one. It's got a lot of sound for such a small, simple design. While taking it out of the box for the first time, I was a bit suprised at how small it actually was.It comes with pretty much every iPod adapter known, and has the option to install batteries if you feel like taking it where there is nowhere to plug it in. I also like that it charges my iPod while docked. If there was one area of improvement for this guy, it would need to have a remote with it. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Great job Cyber Acoustics!"
4,satisfied,THis is a nice basic docking station..volume doesn't go very loud...would be great if it came w/ a remote....
2,Didn't last long,"I was very pleased with the Cyber Acoustics portable digital docking speaker when I first got it - it worked exactly as I expected. I use my iPod to listen to audio books and the speaker sound was perfectly fine. After about 6 months, my husband and I were out of the country for almost 7 months and the speaker system not used at all. We are now back and the speaker system now only stays at the beginning very low volume; the increase button does not increase the sound at all. So unfortunately we only got about 6 months use from the product. My rating of the product has gone down immensely."
4,low priced gem,"This is a small unit with a small price, and easily portable. I will take it with me on vacation. Set it up at the resort and listen to MY music."
3,"Not Bad, But You Won't Be Blasting Your Music Either","From the picture and description, I was picturing this product to be a little larger and higher quality. When I received it, I was surprised at how inexpensive it felt, construction wise. I was concerned that it wouldn't charge my iPhone 4 (Verizon) and happy to find out it did so (even though I got an error message saying it wasn't a supported device). Anyways, for a medium-low price you get a medium-low quality. It's perfect for sitting on my desk at work, charging my phone, and playing some tunes softly."
3,Just OK,Sender gets 5 stars for being quick. Product works OK but when bumped the ipod will stop playing. Don't plan on using in a car on rough roads. I am using this in a fire truck here in Iraq. Even though the roads are paved the trucks ride a bit rough and the music will stop playing if it's toobumpy. Also when you put the ipod in the unit it does not always recognize the speakers and continues to play over the built in ipod speaker. For the $$ it works well when not bumped around or carried.
4,"Good, does what its supposed to do :)","Does what its supposed to do.I didn't buy this for major sound quality, just wanted something cheap for one of our daughter's rooms to play good-night music, or some audio tapes on. And that's what it does perfectly.The sound isn't like Bose obviously, but I got it for a great sale price, and for that price it was absolutely worth it, and I would recommend it to anyone. Unless you want awesome sound, then you might want to look around some more."
5,"Small, Powerful, Affordable","I bought these for my mom to put in her office and she loves it. I wanted to keep it for myself, but ended up gifting it as initial intended. They are small, but sound very good and can get relatively loud. They are great for the office because they are relatively compact and charge your phone/ ipod. When current speakers burn out i will likely buy this item for myself. Great Purchase."
4,AGift,"I ordered this for a gift for my grandson, He was very pleased with it. The product preformed as it was intended."
1,Broke after a couple months of useage,At first this was a great product and fabulous sound plus charging. But after a couple of months of usage it just quit working. I think the connector needs to be beefed up a bit.
5,Great sound quality!,I bought this for my office. The sound quality is great! The volume was more than enough for a small office. I thought this was a great value.
2,Expected more for the price!,I chose to buy these speakers based on reviews and am disappointed in the sound quality at high volume. I expected to be wowed by them but they failed to deliver the performance I was looking for! I did a lot of searching and checking out reviews before actually purchasing these speakers but I guess I wasnt thorough enough:(
1,Piece of junk,"I'm a little bitter about all the positive reviews for this. I don't get it and will think twice about giving the Amazon reviews credibility in the future. I completely regret purchasing this. It's super light, feels plainly cheap and the sound is sub par. Perhaps worst of all, the buttons are sticky and it's hard to tell if its even turned on or not. It is total garbage."
1,Hard to read,"the author misrepresented the meaning of scripture throughout the book. He seemed totally ignorant of what the actual facts are. He was never objective and missed the real reason altogether. I read it through because I believe we should be armed with all information. He should have spent more time on his research. Using both Old and New Testament references, he weaved a tale far from any accepted interpretation. If I haven't made it clear enough, the book was biased.As with everything I read I check facts where they can be checked,but I am also willing to look at another's viewpoint even when I disagree. Unfortunately, this author does not.C. White"
4,Illuminating,"I am not a Christian nor a Jew, I am a deist. The book clarifies why so many people will never accept Jesus as being divine and shows him as a failed profet, which he was."
1,Anti-Semetic Tripe,"I borrowed this book from a friend and was disgusted at every turn of the page. Mr. Klinghoffer must be one of the most self-hating, ultra right-wing jews i've encountered in modern day literature. His crowning achievement must be the book's complete lack of scholarship. Don't waste your money."
5,"Educational and Readable, Very Eye-Opening","I thought this book was excellent, and very respectful of both Judaism and Christianity. Very well-researched and presented a lot of new ideas and interpretations that I had never thought of. I don't usually read history for enjoyment, but I can truly say that I enjoyed this book and learned a lot. In spite of the controversial-sounding title, this is a book that can only help relations between Christians and Jews."
3,turning their back on jesus,The author presents the reasons why the Jews of the day rejected Jesus. Points explained are that many didnt know who he was as there were many claining to be the messiah back then. Also many wealthy jews did not want a peasant Jew to be regarded as their spirtual leader. Interesting discussion about the ever present infighting amongst jews.
5,"The Jews DID NOT reject Jesus, Jesus rejected the Jews","In Jn 1:11 we are told in English that Jesus came unto His own and they received Him not. The Greek tells us that the Ideeah (GR), the concept of Him came unto His own and they didn't Parlayvon (GR)understand the concept. Yeshua came unto His own for the lost sheep. Not the Righteous. The Jews didn't reject Him, He rejected the Jews. If He wanted them to understand they would have. They already had a Covenant with God. Jesus tells us in Jn10:16 there are other sheep not of this fold that He must bring in. He came to the Jews to set the Law upright so that those He chose could minister to the ""Other Sheep"". He did not come for the Jews, not at that time.ShalomHarvey Cohen, RabbiBosko Ministries"
5,"Must reading for every Jew, and eye-opening for Christians","An outstanding book, likely to be very controversial, and very beautifully and thoghtfully written. The book makes a compelling case for the Jewish rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. Christians often wonder why Jews don't accept Jesus as their savior, and Jews, who are usually less text-conscious than Christians, don't have a good answer. Any Jew who reads this will understand why Judaism doesn't believe in Jesus. Any Christian who reads the book may end up having to reconsider his or her beliefs."
3,Why have Christians persecuted Jews...read book to find out,"The book certainly delivers on the title. But it is as biased against Christianity as some Christian thinking is and was biased against Jewish ideas. The author is certainly well read in scripture and the Jewish Talmud, but he can ""spin"" a verse just like Christianity does to prove his point of view, which he has already decided is the absolute truth. And the author does again and again, sometimes repeating his point numerous times in different ways. This book is okay but somehow I expected much more."
4,"Interesting points, but the style of writting leaves something to be desired","I found this book filled with many good points that many others have already discussed, my biggest issue with this book is the style of writting is not clean, subjects wander in and wander out of focus without much direction. I feel this is a large distraction to what should have been for consise reasoning.What is good about this book is a feel for the time period in which Jesus exsisted, and the author gives very compelling reasoning that most jews could not have even heard of Jesus or his message, but less reject his message. I feel this book along with many of Pagel's books gives a good sense of what the split of christainity and judism were like. The book is worth reading, but we warned all arguments are not linear, and the reading may take longer than expected."
5,A FORGOTTEN HISTORY IS REVEALED,"This is a wonderful collection of short stories that manages to be both comforting and challenging at times. The traditions and cultural experiences of South Africa's large Indian population are explored through a series of engaging short stories that reveal the hidden history of a people often neglected by the traditional black versus white study of South Africa. Sam draws upon the family research she undertook in her South African homeland together with her own experiences living in exile in the United Kingdom, to suggest characters and situations that enjoy depth and resonance. Her natural empathy with the subject matter is finely balanced with an understated subtlety that helps avoid sentimentality in favour of compassion. The result is an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. A remarkable achievement.Agnes Sam's other works include ""Dora"" and ""The Tyranny of Karma"" both for BBC Radio 4 (London, UK). She is currently working on her first novel."
5,American Classical Music at its highest level!,This is a beautiful CD with an abundance of well known and not so well known American piano music from last and this century. There are 22 pieces on this CD and the styles range from highly romantic and elegant to highly rhythmical and elecrifying which keep you at the edge of your seat.The performance is sparkling and superb and one hears Rebecca Bogart's joy and deep soul behind each piece.This will definitely be one of this year's Christmas gifts for all my music loving relatives and friends!
5,Subaru's Sacrifice,"The shock of Kotori's death and the fight with Fuma have left Kamui unconscious. As a last resort, Subaru has used his power to invade Kamui's mind and give him a reason to keep on living. Upon awakening, Kamui decides that he will fight to bring Fuma back to his senses. Even though Kamui has regained consciousness, Subaru is injured from his technique and will not be able to fight for a while.This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan."
4,Fun for the family,We bought this to take to our summer camp in Maine and everyone loved it. Also teaches the young people something about New England geography and history.
5,amazing.,"In 1984 when INXS released 'The Swing' it was hard to believe there was still a huge depth of talent to come. ""KICK"" is truly a remarkable album. The songwriting talents of Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence once again stand out but with this album the band has an everlasting legacy in rock music. Need You Tonight, New Sensation, Devil Inside and Never Tears us Apart. A collection of four singles that are indeed classics. The range from Rock anthem, guitar riff Devil Inside through to the ballad of Never Tear Us Apart which was fittingly played at Michael's funeral. These tracks are supported by the rejuvenated Australian classic ""The Loved One"", first heard on INXS'S INXSIVE back in 1981. If the album needs any further qualities try and get a video of its film clips especially New Sensation and Never Tear Us Apart shot in beautiful Prague. Everyone who enjoys INXS to any degree must have this CD in their collection"
4,Good album from INXS,INXS / Kick: This one has a few big radio hits and the rest of the songs are good. This is a very enjoyable album. The bonus cuts are ok. Four Stars
3,INXS hits Mainstream,"Before Kick , this band was a kind of cool group gen-x'ers coveted on their backpacks with bands like the Cure, Love & Rockets, & the Smiths. But once this album launched them onto the Pop Commerical Radio Stations of the World it was like Prince's Purple Rain all over for the fans. Great album and probably the last really good original sounding album they did. My must have INXS cd's stop at Listen Like Thieves but if I find this in a bargain bin for under five bucks I'll probably pick it up."
4,Kick in the pants,"Kick came out when i was in my late teens. I loved all the songs played on the radio so much, i decided to purchase the CD. I have to say honestly that, except for the hit songs, i really didn't care much for the rest of them.If it didn't have so many hits, i would have given it 3 stars. Still, wonderful to go back to and listen to those great songs."
3,Pleasant enough,"I think the real reason I bought it ( or anyone for that matter ) was to own Need You Tonight. The song was perfect from the get-go. Funky drumbeat, guitars that oozed class and all in all great lyrics to fit a great song. Apart from Guns In The Sky nothing really outclasses it ( nothing can ). Some of the other songs are alright but the last three songs on the album itself just seem to be a case of the band running out of energy with the ideas and it just seemed to go one bit too far. If it had cut those songs out we would have seen a perfect pop-rock album but as it stands it has stood the test of time rather well. Now let's hear it for Need You Tonight one more time"
4,An excess of great songs.,"Personally I think every INXS album from ""Shabooh Shoobah"" to ""Welcome To Wherever You Are"" is great, but I admit this is probably their overall best one, and easily their most popular. Besides the four huge singles, other quality songs are ""Guns In The Sky"", ""Wild Life"", ""Mystify"", and the title track. In fact only the last two original songs I would call filler. I, like many have always somewhat compared them to U2, as their careers were similar up to the mid 90's, and ""Kick"" is obviously their ""Joshua Tree"", though more pop/rock. The bonus tracks here are just that, but it's the original 12 that make this album so sweet. Give it another spin and remember how good it is."
3,its ok,"This book is very basic. If you have never taken a praxis and need to know question stems or question types, this might be ok for you. I havent taken the praxis yet, but this book is so basic and broad that I dont think this will help."
5,Funniest show on the planet!,I love the opening song written by John Lurie himself. Hooked me from the start. A must see for fish lover and haters alike.
4,excellent,"Charlie Mariano was a saprano sax player who worked with Mingus on his avant-big band assault,The Black Saint & The Sinner Ladyin 1963.By the 70s, the wall between rock and jazz came down, and when Mariano was not working with German fusion bugs Embryo, he made albums like Mirror.This is rocked up jazz played with electric pianos, which Mariano sails over in Coltranian loops. Don't come expecting the avant funk fusion Miles was working at this time, but this is no mellow CTI trip either.Mirror is not merely jazz with electric keyboards. The improvisation impulse of the music is surely outi of jazz, but the interplay and variations in textures--listen to how the drummer uses his cymbals--is straight from art rock.None of which matters much, other than to describe. These musicians surely were not thinking of genre names when they were cooking along this great music, and the best move you can make is to hear it"
2,"Not near as good as ""Zoom""","If you have never seen any books by this author before then I would recommend purchasing ""Zoom"". It's amazing which made me slightly disappointed with this one. I was hoping it would be just as good as the first but it was harder to follow and wasn't as fun to look at. I wish I had not bought it.<...>"
3,"OK, but not as good as ZOOM","The first book, Zoom, is fun and fascinating when ""read' for the first time. Re-zoom may be equally clever, but is basically just more of the same. If someone has seen the first book and gets the gist of the ""zooming,"" then the predictablilty of the next page of Re-zoom takes away from the ""wow"" experience of the first book. If one were to read only one of these books, I would definitely recommend the first, Zoom."
4,It IS great for kids!,Our 5 year old got this as a birthday gift...he and his 7 year old brother LOVE this book and love explaining it to adult who don't get it quick enough! A great gift! We have to get Zoom now!
2,better off with zoom #1,"Buy the zoom book and you do not need re-zoom. I am not really sure why I bought this, except I thought it would be a little different, well I was wrong. Same concept, just different pictures...eh! stick with zoom # 1 a classic which teaches a lesson in how we view the world around us."
2,Not as good as the orgininal,Follows the same theme as zoom his first book but not as creative and the zoom doesnt quite line up. If I could do it again I wouldn't bother.
4,Second generation of Zoom,"I bought this book at the same time as I bought Zoom. Both are great books for getting people to think outside the box, but for some reason, I still like the original Zoom best. Still a good book though."
5,Re-ZOOM is GREAT!,"The product came promptly and was in great condition.I ordered this book with the intention of cutting the binding off and laminating each page, so the whole family could play.It was a relief to find that each page was black on the back, with an image on the front. I was hoping this was the case, but there was no way to tell from the advertisements on-line. So, that's the ONE thing I would have liked to know before I purchased it. Even though Istvan Banyai's book was designed this way, I've come to find that it doesn't insure that every copy made will be exactly like the first printings. In my experience, I've had a few sad surprises.But not today! Today we play!"
4,"Great book, but not quite for 4-8 year olds in my opinion","I was a bit surprised when we received Hanuman. The information provided is a bit contradictory - the publisher's info say age range 4-8 (pre-K to 3rd grade), but the review is for Grades 3-6. I think the latter is more accurate - it is lengthy and written for the older audience.That being said, it is still a wonderful book with beautiful pictures my 3 1/2 year old loves. I am sure she will enjoy reading it someday, but today we give her the Cliff Notes version of the story. :)I have since stumbled onto multiple books by this publisher and find them to be wonderful, and will save them for my kids as they get older. They are sometimes not easy to find."
5,Life signs,"I am a biologist. And a hiparbaric physician, also a huge fan of star trek , I love to read about science specially usednfor science fiction"
5,Science + Star Trek = Fun,"A wonderful book, very readable, offering the insight of two scientists who explain the hows and whys of the biology of Star Trek. They do live up to ""The Physics of Star Trek"" and express how all this is possible, and gently point out where it isn't (i.e. if your space suit ruptured in open space, you'd probably be crushed by the vacuum, so Worf wouldn't have time to repair his suit with some handy Borg tubing).Regards to the Publisher's Weekly tease (""Why do all planets look like California?""), the authors actually say that the show was filmed in Souther California, hence, it was only able to offer some traditional Earth plant-life, whereas the real galaxy will have plants we cannot even fathom right now. Bush-Cheney '04."
4,Fascinating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was not the ultra-heavy science book I'd been lead to believe by the title, but it was very a informative and fascinating look at the different humanoids of Star Trek and what really constitutes a life. Definitely for the science fan, the Sci-fi fan, and the Star Trek fan. I don't know that non-Trekkers would like it because they may or may not get it. But definitely a good read."
5,It does its job,"I would recommend this product again, it is relatively effective, and it serves its purpose. Also, it does not require alot of lube, so even the ""tightest"" places are easily available with this product."
5,Pure Poetry,"Love From The Inside Out is a rare find...each page is filled with romance, spirituality and eloquent descriptions of life experiences. Dr. Evan's writings described feelings and emotions that I didn't think were possible to capture on paper. The book is divided into three sections appropriately entitled Mind, Body and Spirit...each chapter moving in it's own way. Be sure and have the one you love near by for the section entitled ""Body""!"
3,My dog gets it but doesn't love it,"I was a little disappointed in the construction of this toy. My dog seemed to get that the purpose was for her to remove the smaller toys once I stuff them in the house, and she does this sometimes, but most of the time she just chews on the house. This is how I discovered that the bottom panel of the house is just plastic covered in fabric. Given the purpose of a dog toy is to eventually be destroyed I guess this is okay but I worry that she will injest small pieces of the plastic and therefore only encourage her to do it when I'm supervising her. She does chew on the three smaller pieces from time to time as well and they've actually help up pretty good for the past 3 months. The ball from the top of the gingerbread man's hat hasn't even torn off yet so I guess that's good."
3,Quare Women,"Got the book sooner than expected. Its an old book but in pretty decent condition. I love the story since its written about an area near where I grew up. The words and language are typical of that generation of people. My grandparents spoke very much like these people did even though we lived nearer the ""flat lands"" than in the mountains."
5,Excellent era!!,"the brian howe era is the best from bad company...very melodic music and this cd is not the exception...very very good, like Holy Water or Here Comes Trouble...excellent"
4,Good without Paul Rodgers,"I really liked this CD, it keeps moving and never lets you forget that just because Paul had left they weren't stopping. I owned it when it first released, then reordered it on CD from the cassette I originally owned and wore out, but I guess I had only gotten older, since it was maybe 18 years since the cassette and CD, It was still good, but not AS good as I remembered. Still though, I have it ripped on my computers and select tune on my Blackberry, Bad Company lives!"
3,the perfect companion for 'Holy Water',"When 'Holy Water' went huge with radio airplay they decided to stick to a winning formula and it worked big timethe same dark bluesy performance of catchy hit songs continues here'One Night' 'No Smoke Without A Fire' 'The Way It Goes' and my favorite 'Shake It Up' makes this a winning albumthe upside - from start to finish this is one hit song after another,the songwriting is fantastic,my favorite tracks are 'Shake It Up' and 'The Way It Goes' and 'No Smoke Without A Fire'the downside - the only small complaint is that it sounds almost identical to 'Holy Water' but it's not really a bad thing,it just shows they found their style and wanted to stick with itthe bottom line - if you love great rock and roll with catchy hooks and great lyrics,this is the album for you...donutman says so!!!"
2,Flimsy plastic tabs are a nuisance,"I eventually gave up requesting replacement head housings--that's the removable portion that holds the screens. The thin tabs that are essential to holding the screens in place break under normal use--not when I'm changing the screens or blades, but they simply fall off, and replacements are not sold in stores. They sent me free replacements, then when I said that I had had another breakage, they didn't respond. I told them I was willing to pay for these things, but they acted like I was still complaining that the first one broke, when it was that they were so flimsy. The screens fly off without these tiny tabs 3mm wide, which makes the whole thing useless.I liked the shave I got from it, but without an easy way to continually replace this fragile part, I recommend that people not buy it."
1,Don't bother,"I have purchased at least three of the Remington corded and cordless shavers in this style and variety and have eventually returned them under warranty or thrown them away. Within a few months or year, they quit working. It may be an electric motor failure. Remington has always been prompt to honor their warranty and send me new replacements. I even had to return one of the replacements. I have some limited experience with the newer models of corded and cordless Remingtons and they seem to be holding up much better than this model. Their products give a great, close shave and are easy to maintain and use. Just be prepared to send it back under warranty if the motor starts to slow or it gets to the point that it won't work at all."
3,Don't get fooled,"I had thought this was a great price for an electric shaver and if you look at the picture, you might even think it is a cordless shaver - but I was in for a shock when I opened the package to see it was a 'corded' electric shaver... that to me is false advertising - it is not mentioned anywhere in the product description.So I returned the item and am waiting for a refund."
3,Beautiful - Christina Aguilera,"Canadian CD Single Track Listing for -""BEAUTIFUL"" - CHRISTINA AGUILERA1) Beautiful - 3:582) Dame Lo Que Yo Te Doy (Get Mine, Get Yours - Spanish Version) - 3:$62002"
2,OK- but not great...wouldn't recommend for new ipod classics,"It was inexpensive and other people seemed to do ok with it. I have a 80g ipod classic and wanted a lightweight case. The color was good (smoky transparent)but the size is terrible. The photo shows it fitting the ipod classic but doesn't. It's loose on the ipod! the screen protector was ok (as it's built in and isn't an option) but the window was tiny! Cuts off almost a 1/4"" on each side of the viewing screen. It was cheap enough that I won't return it, but I'll be needing to buy another."
4,Basic but helpful,This skin is useful because it has a clip for a pocket or waistband. The product is simple but effective.
1,sending it back,"i was excited because this bra got such great reviews, but i found the fit to be terrible. full coverage is an understatement... the cups cover like a turtle neck and there is room left, though it should be my size, and is my size in all other brands. i woudl try this on in a store before ordering..."
1,WARNING,"I am a 38D in all bras, Victoria Secret, Playtex, Beyond Bare, but this one is way tooooooo tight. The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too. I would not recommend. I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one."
4,"Good bra, just not for me","Bought this bra after reading the reviews on it. I liked the colour and the style. However, i was disappointed when i tried it on. I wear 38DDD and I normally love Playtex bras, I find that they are well made, comfortable and durable, this one was no exception, however, I felt like the bra was wearing me, rather than I wearing the bra, the cups just felt so big and I don't like the shape they gave my breasts. I ended up giving it to my sister, who loves it, it's her favourite bra now. Good bra, just not for me."
2,corded shaver review,My husband's huge complaint is it needs a stronger motor. It sounds and feels draggy.
5,Exceptional lyrics. Good for me and my teenage children.,At first I wasn't sure...by the second go around I was hooked. These guys will be out there for a long time. I have purchased both of their albums and look forward to the next. How about a video clip guys!
2,"Lightweight, but tend to float in a Masectomy Bra","These are just ""ok."" They tend to float around in a masectomy bra, and if you are wearing a tight shirt, you can see the edges.They are washable."

4,You wont be disappointed,"If you have ever faced disappointments in life this book is a must read. This book includes a 13 week study guide; so it is ideal for a group study,although it can be used individually as well. Filled with scripture, personal experiences and Godly advice this book helps those who may now be experiencing disappointments in life or are still dealing with previous ones.Although I was deeply encouraged by this book, I was also convicted. Like many I have experienced some devastating disappointments in my lifetime. This book helped me to look at the source of those problems and how I can deal with them in the way God wants me to as a child of God. Subject matter includes past regrets, facing the pain, a call to courage, and more.Please take the time to read this wonderful book, you won't be disappointed."
4,As Silver Refined: A Deeply Challenging Work,"Stacks of books on my dresser topple and fall. ""Silver Refined"" catches my eye, and upon cracking it open, I cringe as my eyes drink in the opening lines. I whisper, ""Lord, why does REFINING have to be so painful. I don't know if I want to be refined . . .""Kay Arthur knows from a painful past the agony of being refined. Melted and poured out, Kay's horrific personal experiences (which came as an utter surprise to me) have molded her into one of the most godly women teachers of the Bible. Stories of God's work in her life, as well in the lives of her friends serve to demonstrate that God is a God to be trusted. And the pain the accompanies trials lifts our faces to a God who HEALS.I definitely ate this book up -- 4 stars for this excellent resource for people going through difficult times in their lives.I received a copy of this book from Blogging for Books for reviewing-- which in no way influenced my review."
3,Staunchly Calvinistic,"One of the most difficult realities for Christians is answering the Why's. Why do bad things happen? Why does evil exist? These questions often eat away at us until it paralyzes our faith.Kay Arthur does a good job of encouraging the reader, but the book is definitely written from a staunchly Calvinistic mindset. As a Wesleyan, I disagree with many of her conclusions, but she presents her arguments well.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,Love Kay Arthur,I always enjoy the godly wisdom found in Kay Arthurs books and studies. I would recommend for anyone wanting to gain even clearer understanding of how God works in our lives.
3,As Silver Refined,"I recently reviewed the book As Silver Refined by Kay Arthur. I'll be honest... I somewhat dread reviewing it because I feel like I am not going to do it justice.This book is all about life's disappointments. Kay Arthurt discusses everything from feeling like a failure to learning how to endure through suffering. She makes wonderful points and it is an interesting read, but a lot of these things just don't apply to my life right now.I believe if you are going through trials in your life and you feel separated from God this will be a good book for you to read. There is a study guide included in this book that you can do alone or in a group setting. That would be a great tool to use also.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,Good topic,"""As Silver Refined"" is a Christian Living book about how God uses even the bad things in your life to further His purpose of making you more like Christ (if you'll let Him). I've read several books on this subject, like ""Hearing Jesus Speak into Your Sorrow"" by Nancy Guthrie, which I felt explained many of the same truths in fewer, more powerful words. However, different writing styles can sometimes speak to different people, so I'm always happy to see a book that points people to the Scriptures for truth and healing.She made some good points and told some touching stories to underline her points. Overall, I'd recommend this book, though maybe not as much as some of the other books on this same topic that I've reviewed."
3,Devotional read,"This book by Kay Arthur takes as its theme the refining of silver and relates that refining to the refining that God does in and through us when we have trials, tribulations, and troubles. It is well done with a wealth of stories to back up her theme. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,God Really Loves Me!!!!,"I just Praise God for the words and wisdom that God gave Kay to write this book. I know that the trial that I recently have gone through was my disappointment and His appointment. Jesus really cares about me, His grace is so beautiful. I am so thankful that I read this book because it has really blessed and has made a difference in the way I think and pray in my life and especially on whom I am...Kay I wish I could tell you all that I have gone through and what a blessing it is to have read your book. I thank Jesus for your words and wisdom.....God is so good!!!!"
1,NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOKS SINCE OCT 23'2009,"I am still waiting for this book bought from Jersey XRAY since Oct 23, tried to talk with Amazon.com, their computer system ENABLE the item NOT RECEIVED THE ITEM. I had to dispute the transaction with my bank.thanks"
1,This book is DANGEROUS!,"As an experienced gel candlemaker I'm appalled at the dangerous projects this book showcases! Never, I repeat NEVER seat an untabbed wick in gel. HELLO - it's a fire hazard! Speaking of fire hazards, please don't embed many of the items recommended - just because it's ""not near"" the wick doesn't mean it can't catch fire.The book also gives instructions on cooking your own gel with mineral oil and resin which is a direction violation of Federal Trademark law.This book is a disgrace to candlemaking. I'm embarrassed. This inexperienced candlemaker/author did NO significant research before publishing this rubbish. Inexperienced gellers are being ripped off simply trying to learn gelling. Don't waste your hard earned cash here."
1,Doesn't fit properly on 7mm wires,"I dont really like how this product fits my NGK 7mm wires, it's just loose. I just took it off as soon as I put it on. It was a cheap product from a good-known quality manufacturer, so I think that it applies to ""you get what you pay for"".Quality-wise it just looks and feels cheap, no common from the previous protucts I've gotten from Moroso."
2,Moroso Wire Separators,"I recieved these wire separators and they are as they appear. Something I don't like about them is that they're not very flexible. I also don't like that they aren't a round fitting where the wire slides in, they have bumps/dimples I guess to keep the wire in once there? I didn't like it. They also seem to be somewhat bulky compared to my factory wire separators... I didn't even bother to keep them on, I just replaced my worn out factory separators with some from a donor car."
4,LGP3LNC,"I would rate this 5 stars because I love these dolls so much.But um,I seriusly would weae tennis shoes or hiking boots.Not heels.But, still, this is a nice doll."
2,Yet another great way to teach your child to be impractical.,"Once again, the Bratz prove to be just as outdoorsy as any other doll. Just as long as they have their designer canteens on hand, not to mention their oh so useful-in-the-wilderness stilleto boots. At least when Barbie goes camping she does it practically. Do you see Barbie prancing around the campfire in a mini skirt and bare midriff? And then acting surprised when she finds out that the mosquitoes have bitten her all to hell? I think not.That's all I have to say. Once they release the Bratz Camp Fire Woodsy Vanity and the Plush Bratz Camp Fire Tent complete with manicure station, shoe rack and deluxe bathroom, then you can expect more reviews from me. I think what the Bratz really need is the Bratz Camp Fire Burn Ward and Intensive Care for Insect Bites Center. Now that's something that would come in useful AND teach your kid to not be the skanky extra in one of those bad forest horror movies.The Raven (strikes again!)"
2,Um...Okay,"I like Bratz. My favorite are Fiana, Jade, and Phoebe. I liked Phoebe because I thought she dressed like me and that her personality was like mine. I was stunned by Bratz Treasures and Bratz Wild Wild West. Bratz camp Fire made me think otherwise. If they are wearing such large jackets and the name is camp fire, then I'm guessing it's really cold. Yet just like in wintertime wonderland, they are wearing skirts. I think this collection doesn't have good colors. They either have dark and ugly colors on or many different bright colors on. I don't like Phoebe's new hair color at all. I think this collection of dolls and the dolls cartoon pictures are bad. Buy a different kind of Bratz, but not this one. There are way better ones out there."
3,"Cute doll - but dressed for camping, i don't know","This doll, is a gorgeous breathe of fresh air. The overall design of this doll is well, but whoever came up with the idea that this is a Camping doll, must have been blind - folded while designing them. The clothes this doll is wearing, isn't exactly camping material. I mean, would you wear boots and a mini skirt camping? This is a cute doll and i really enjoy it, but it was just falsly named. I especially love her soft hair, her bright blue eyes and her make up."
3,I agree with the Raven,"She is awesome and she didn't just totally wipe out bratz so you don't be hatin'! Even if you like these dolls, they aren't perfect. The best I an say about this doll is wellher dress is ugly and knittedher make up looks like ashher hair is all messed upher coat is nice, thoher boots match her coatI suggest you get another doll!"
5,EVERYONE,Okay guys I know theres been wars between Barbie/My Scene & Bratz well I used to HATE Bratz but I love them ALL so don't say they are ugly or stuff like that bye.
1,She is wearing too short.How stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This doll is uncool.She is ugly and she is wearing tooooooooooooooo short.How stupid.YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Awsome Phoebe,Thgis Phoebe is awsome. She is pretty and fashionable. I love this Phoebe. I want her.
3,Pretty funny,Lots of cute pictures with witty captions; the 'future plans' segment falls a little flat. A good read for when you're in a really cranky mood and you need something to brighten your outlook.
2,Second strike isn't deadly...,"Relative late-comers to the Thrash Metal elite, Testament dropped a vicious, thundering classic of a debut before gradually spiralling into a vortex of mediocrity over their next few records. Objectively, 'The New Order' is a pretty decent follow-up. The production is clearer and crunchier and the song-writing and performances are almost as strong. Nevertheless, this record has none of the intensity and youthful enthusiasm that makes 'The Legacy' special.'Disciples of the Watch' is the only truly classic moment here - a Thrash masterpiece and one of the band's finest ever moments. Most of the rest of the album sounds self-conscious and contrived, the only time the band sound like they're having any fun is on the decent Aerosmith cover. If you judge this type of music on riffs and solos then it is probably worth purchasing, look elsewhere if you crave urgency and spark. Either way, get 'The Legacy' first."
2,Can't remember a thing from it,"Better than Metallica? Please.There's nothing essentially bad about Testament, it's just that nothing they do sticks out in any way. They're the musical equivalent of Matt Damon.The title track is pretty decent, and Skolnick has some good solos, but otherwise this is just cheap 80s thrash."
5,the fasha of all testament albums,"testament may not be one of my fav bands but this is a brutal, awesome,kick in the teeth,set building on fire album.people say disciples of the watch is the best testament song ever.......naaaaaaaaaaa i totally disagree,the new order is waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy better than that song,disciples is still good though.alex skolnick is an excellent lead guitarist and i heard he's only 18 or 19,i was impressed.there are some instrumentals which are okay in here like hypnosis and the areosmith cover is okay.but somehow i get the feeling that their another metallica,if you learn about them a lot you'll know what i mean take a look at the similarities.if you dont have this just get your @$$ of the chair and get it,and you wont regret it"
4,Man it never gets old!,"Well I have to give it 4 stars. Would have been 5, but, side one is no where near as good as side two of this CD is. I am a huge Testament fan, and always will be. I love the amazing voice of Chuck Billy! And I strongly feel that this is a must have for any music fan!"
5,Love it,"This book is incredible. I love that it has me reading scripture, something I never seem to get around to in my busy day. I also found it has enhanced my prayer life because it actually teaches you how to and what to pray. There are sample prayers at the end of each chapter that are based on Bible verses and there are blanks to add in the name of your children. I find myself putting all sorts of people's names in the prayers... my sister, mother, husband, friends. On top of all this, the chapters are short and easy to squeeze into your schedule. I am so glad I bought this book, and plan on buying it for all my Christian mom friends."
5,Must Have,If a parent could have only one handbook for their children this is the one. Are you interested in raising children into their destiny? This book has the answers. Would recommend this book to all parents.
3,Damaged goods.,"The book is great, but came damaged...toward the back there were about 10 pages that had been folded back either in printing or packing. I didn't have time to send for a new one, so unfolded them, steamed them and then clamped them for overnight..It worked pretty well. It has value in its content, and I knew the recipient wouldn't mind."
2,Not sure of a use for these quilts,"Out of all Tomoko Fuse's books that I have, this is probably the most disappointing. I guess most of the problem is that I just can't see a use for Origami Quilts. TheKusudama Origamican be hung up, the boxes (Origami BoxesandFabulous Origami Boxes) can be given as gifts and used to hold things, but the quilts?As usual, I find the instructions easy to follow and you can create some great looking quilts. Just not sure what to do with them!"
5,"Magic tree house, night of the new magicians","I have been reading this series of books to my son, who is 6, for about a year. He loves all of the books in the series."
5,7 year old loved it.,It's so nice to find a book for young boys that are not dark or scarey. A light-hearted book that my son really enjoyed.
5,Preston's (Five Year Old) Review -,"Preston starts kindergarten this fall. He asked his dad if he could write (or rather dictate) a review.Why is the story called ""Night of the New Magicians""? I liked the book because it was exciting cause instead of a car the magic tree house just spins. The tree house spinning is kind of magic. My favorite part was when Jack and Annie went to the tree house."
5,What a amazing book!,"Night of the New Magicians was one of my favorite Magic Treehouse books. The story was about Jack and his little sister Annie going to the time of Paris World's Fair,1889.Their mission was to find and protect the Magicians of Sound,Light,Invisible,and Iron from a evil sorcerror. There wasn'tthe evil sorcerror at the World's Fair. But it made Jack andAnnie to do their mission more quickly and to use their magicrhymes from their friends from mythical lands, Teddy and Kathleen, more wisely.I am really exited about the next book 'Blizzard of the Blue Moon'too!"
3,Not the best one...,"I read this book with my 7 year old son the same day it came out. He was wildly excited about it, as he has been about all the Magic Tree House books. From a grown-up perspective, however, this was not one of the best books of the series. Yes, it was educational, and my son and I had a good time talking about some of the characters Jack and Annie meet in the book. But the plot seemed a little weaker than usual. The part about the evil sorcerer was strange. I had expected a great revelation at the end: The evil sorcerer is actually ignorance, or superstition, or something along those lines. Instead, the book just fizzled at the end.Nevertheless, my son has started counting down to the date when the next book is coming out!"
2,cable access is not what its cracked up to be.,"This movie is just a bunch of cable access shows from midnight blue. The title didn't lie. It was just boring. Don't get me wrong, it is informative. There are facts about the stars of deepthoat.The comercials for the movie should of been cut. 1 set possibly could of been left in to give you a feel of the times. But, there are just too many of them in between the interviews.If you are a fan of the original shows, then you might enjoy going back in time. The rest, beware."
1,disappointing,"This is a copy of an old cable TV, talk show.There's no Porn in it.You could show it to your young daughter and it would put her to sleep.Boring.Don't buy it."
1,Don't bother - not worth it,"Oh boy, this was a real stinker - bought it thinking it must be even slightly interesting. Very boring...."
2,not like the photo,"this item is good looking, and go perfectly with the crib, however the color on the photo is absolutely diferentthe color of the honey oak look alamost like natural color."
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap and flimsy changing table. After only about 6 months, the bottom shelf (which was used the least) fell thru and white finish started chipping. We regret not spending a little more and having something that would last at least another year. Also bear in mind that this changer is quite small, our 15 month old (petite) daughter doesn't fit comfortably anymore. Would not reccomend or buy again"
2,We had to return this table due to water damage,When we opened the box that this table came in I immediately was struck by the peculiar smell of mildew/varnish mixture. Upon examination we found that the shelves had water marks indicating some type of water damage. The smell of the varnish was also too strong to consider keeping this item in a baby's room.
4,Great table; flimsy pad,"I bought this changing table and matching cribs for my new twins in October. Like the cribs, the table looks great and is of high quality. My only complaint is the changing pad, which is covered with incredibly thin gauge plastic. Within two months, the plastic had ripped, leaving a large hole, even though there had been no stress on it, other than the weight of a baby lying on it. My rating is an average of 5 stars for the table and 1 star for the pad (weighted heavily, so that the table quality outweighs the poor pad quality)."
5,Great Product and Customer Service,The changing table arrived early and had easy to follow instructions. While putting it together we noticed a small cosmetic crack on one of the pieces. We contacted customer service (which is online only) and they respond promptly with an apology and a notice that a replacement part had been shipped. I would definitely recommend this product not only because of its quality but because of the wonderful customer service.
3,Leg and Arm Trap for Baby,"This is a sturdy enough changing table and only took about an hour to assemble alone, the last part being the hardest. This is also a nice looking table. However, I am only giving it a 3 star rating because of the danger the open slots pose for the baby's limbs. At three and a half months, my son wiggles quite a bit even while strapped down on the table. As such his legs and arms are constantly getting stuck within the gaps! If you are not super careful and aware of this issue you risk banging your child's feet and hands against the wood when you go to raise them to wipe their hiney or remove them from the surface. I find it very aggravating to have to remove his arms and legs from within these gaps each and every time I change his diaper. Also, the included changing mat is quite thin and I've had to supplement it by laying some foam underneath it. In retrospect I wish I'd paid a little more $ for a table with an enclosed changing area."
4,Good Value,"This is a nice basic changing table, and looks good in our nursery. We also have the matching crib. This was easy to assemble and we didn't have any problems with missing parts. I agree with other reviews that said that the changing pad that comes with it is flimsy. We bought an extra contoured one to put on top of it instead and have been happier with that. It is true, also, that this is not particularly sturdy, but I wasn't looking for a family heirloom. Generally speaking, I expect any furniture that you have to put together yourself with an allen wrench is just not going to be super high quality. It's sturdy enough to hold a baby and all kinds of stuff, though, and we're happy with it. Good value for the money."
5,love,simple and i love it. i decorated it with colored baskets. i do recommend getting a contoured changing pad to put on top.
5,Amazing songs- loud and catchy,"I picked this CD up on the advice of a friend and I was so completely blown away that I had to write a review on here to let people know! In the world of boring corporate rock like Seether, Godsmack and Disturbed things are getting stale! I like some bands like Finch and Deftones but the Shortie record is heavy and catchy all the way through- Listen and try not to sing along to ""5 Seconds""!Anyway, I just want to let people know that they should check this record out 'cuase I know they'll love it if you like bands like the Deftones and finch."
5,Why can't they all be this good??,"I loved this outstanding series! Definitely amongst my favorites...up there with Berserk, Hellsing, and Bebop."
5,A far better finale than I expected,"In all honesty, most of this series is either too ridiculous or too hilarious to be viewed as a serious artwork example. Literally every episode prior to this seemed to be a pointless side adventure that bore little meaning.But brace yourself! With this final installment, Samurai Champloo slashes, kicks, and break-dances into the ranks of the most entertaining anime titles ever. If you are looking for something really really deep, this is the LAST show you should look at( I would direct you to Evangelion). But Samurai Champloo is the most unique example of a butt-kicking anime that I personally have ever seen."
5,Samurai Champloo & Kung Faux are good to go!,Homo-sez-wut? - ( Not this )...I will buy every dvd that ever comes out from Samurai Champloo or Kung Faux because these TV shows kick u-no-wut? -Butt! - That's right. - I said it. - homoz!
5,Awesome!,"What can I really say? Seven incredibly sexy Latina beauties get the opportunity to strip and to strut their stuff--albeit in a more softcore manner. There are no hardcore sexual situations, but who cares? I knew precisely what I was purchasing.Much like the content, the music score is awesome, providing us with a variety of different genres rather than the nonchalant elevator fare that is practically common of any softcore film.Excessive drooling may also occur on the viewer's part, so take the necessary precautions and grab that Kleenex box (and popcorn, beer, et cetera.) before you watch. If you are a die-hard fan of Latina beauties, then this is the most reasonably priced DVD for YOU."
2,Two Stars-Spoilers follow,"After being disappointed in reading Gabriella & Alexander, I still tried Bennett & Camilla and was still disappointed. Once again there was a lot of things happen but it felt like they were trying to destract you from the charactors. I didn't like Bennett at all. Starting with his name and it went down from there. His treatment of Hannah after learning her true idenity comented my hate. I wished Hannah would have stabbed him with a knife. I did however enjoy Hannah thoroughly all of her working with the terrorities in order to bring them down was very exciting. It would have been fun to see series on Hannah's work. Now on to Camilla. Camilla was not a very exciting charactor she was very dull. Her beau Delaney was all right until he got all hung up on her lying about being a princess when he was lying about his own title. Its calling the kettle black and makes me lose all respect and like for the charactor."
5,Remarkable price & razor,I have purchased three of these razors for my two grandsons & a friend & they all like them very much. Good buy for a good razor! I found the same model at a web site for $ 90.00!
5,Great performance and durability! 5 years +,I have had this razor for over five years and it still works great! The only negative is that it operates only from DC power not AC.
2,Lackluster,"This product has two huge issues in my opinion...1) The shave: It doesn't nearly get close enough and you never have an actual clean shaven look. Also you have to go over the same place again and again to get it to shave off the hair properly.2) The battery: Sure it can last a week, but really the only good shave you'll get is if it's literally be 10 seconds off the charger. To make matters worse you can't leave it plugged in and shave.This product main redeeming aspect is that it has an excellent trimmer for thick beards and and sideburns.Overall I am pretty disappointed with it."
1,Terrible Service so far!,"I bought the shaver about 3 1/2 weeks ago...When I first received the shaver, it didnt work...It wouldnt cut on...So I charged it for 19 hrs and it still didnt come on...I sent it back the next day...Its been about 3 weeks and I still havent heard any word from discount jungle...Im still waiting on my replacement product to arrive....I figured it didnt take them long to receive my money so it shouldnt take them long to send me my product..."
1,Shaver!!!????,"It's a horrible device, sounds like a lawn mooverHowever I found few use for this device:* If you want to wake someone early in the morning, just turn on this device* rotate it, trun it on and use it as a vibrater, your girl friend may love it* use in case of emergency,make loud noice to threaten someone* the trimmer could be used as butter slizer"
4,Fun Reading !!,"Stuck on You, by Patti Berg, was a story that I had a lot of fun with. I think most readers will like it too. Nice Job!"
5,Flows effortlessly,"This album is a sleeper. It reminds me a bit of my experience with the movie 'Round Midnight. At first it seems unremarkable; but after 20 minutes or so, I feel I need to be pinched to be reminded that I am not dreaming. The music spirits me away to a special place where I've never been but where I wish to return often. All major jazz soloists have their ""signature"" sound. What is remarkable to me is that neither Spike nor Elaine Delmar evoke a ""signature"" on this album. The music flows naturally and evokes its own signature. If you enjoyed Charlie Haden's ""Haunted Heart"", I think you will be thrilled with this as well."
4,Hi-NRG GEM!,"Extended Well-Done Dance Versions of:Don't Speak, You're So Vain, Because You Loved Me, Sweet Love, Killing Me Softly, Ready or Not, Sweet Dreams, Someday, Children/Voyage, Ooh La La La, You Oughta Know, The Rain and bonus track - What's Up!"
3,Nice introduction,"A nice introduction to the early armies of Islam that conquered an area greater then Rome. In fact, they managed to conquer Persia something that Rome could not. What is also surprising is that they did it so quickly and cheaply.I particularly liked the illustrations and the maps."
3,Good start,"This book offers a good start to understand what happened in the early conquests of Islam. However, in my opinion, the book merits 3 starts because at first, it lacks order. Information is, as I saw, very dispersed in the book. It would have been better to have subtitles allowing the reader to follow the ideas. Second, the book has very few maps showing the movements of the armies. Positive points in the book are its very interesting and highly detailed drawings. The author tries also to keep a neutral and objective tone towards Islamic civilization. In addition, he makes clear that women in Islam are seen as equal to men in dignity, and that they have the right to fight if they want. This shows that David Nicolle is not following the current hatred towards Islam shown by many other authors. In general, Armies of the Muslim Conquest is a good reference and worth its price."
2,brook benton 20 hits,very poor quality for the price. save your money not worth the price. will not buy here again will look somewhere else to make purchases
5,The ucla hammer.,"I Love this hammer very much, obviously I'm a big Bruins fan so you have to support the cause, but as a hammer itself The grip is fantastic, And the detail of the designs as well as the hammer construction are great. I used it to full on destroy a couch and it withstood being used like a sledgehammer as well, thus proving the durability. I would recommend this hammer as well as the other hammers similar to this style to support your schools through all your hammering/dismantling needs."
5,A Triumph!,"Brave Tamara extends to us the priviledge of sharing in her journey through catastrophic grief to the ultimate triumph of recovery as she discovers a life that is not only well worth living, but a life filled with surprises and profound purpose. The Fair Trade is not only a film for those interested in fair trade products, but it is a film for anyone who has suffered loss or longed for a life of meaning. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is beautifully crafted in every way and you will never be the same for having watched it."
3,"A textbook, I think","The author has given a very detailed history of the boss/patron system in South Texas. The subject is interesting, but the book is boring. The book must have been written as a history text book. How unfortunate because the topic could be very exciting."
1,Garbage,"This thing is a piece of cheap garbage. It doesnt close correctly and you need a key to open it. Who needs to keep track of a another key now?? Furthermore, with the case on, you cant put it in the charger cradle. I've thrown mine away after ten minutes."
3,"Tough, but the kick stand sticks","I'm not one to drop my phone often, but I haven't worried about it when I have. Getting the sticky kick stand out often requires a paper clip/ nail file/key, so I've ended up scratching the back of the phone. The clear self-adhesive screen cover complete the protection of the phone.Fair price.I don't know that there's any perfect case out there. Sometimes I wish this had a belt slip or wrist strap, but I do like the kick stand feature.YOU CANNOT DOCK THE PHONE WITHOUT REMOVING THE CASE; have to rely on a plug only."
3,Great product but very hard to open,"This cover protect the phone really well and the stand is great to watch videos. The only problem with it is that there is a lot of dirt going inside and when it's time to clean it, it's really, really hard to open."
3,Good but,"The will give you the ultimate protection for your iPhone but I had two problems with it.1- Once I put my iPhone inside it, I could not open it again, the case open method was a nightmare.2- the dust and dirt will start build under it and you need to open it once a while and clean your phone"
2,Poorly Written Book,"Although I very much like the subject matter of the book and was interested in learning more, I thought the book was poorly written. When the author states that she didn't know anything about writing a book, she wasn't kidding. When you read some of the stories, you kept thinking they couldn't possibly be finished and that you must have missed something. I was expecting something with a little more substance than the story of a fan who sees a helicopter after a concert and decided that it must be Barry Manilow in the helicopter. (You never know whether it is or it isn't.) I am very much a fan of Barry Manilow's music and enjoyed reading his autobiography, ""Sweet Life,"" but I did not like this book at all."
3,Entertaining,Remington is spared from becoming a gay dude forever when his dad agrees to take the curse from him. Everyone lives happily ever after. Gay zombies are relegated to weaving summer hats in a cemetery.Not the worst film in the world. Pretty funny movie.
4,Learn from a Pro!,"Top Barrel Racing rider, Sharon Camarillo, shares her secrets in this book including how to pick a horse, equipment, training, and rider wear. Diagrams for acceptable arena set up are excerpted from the Woman's Professional Rodeo Association rule book. And, this book is LOADED with pictures!"
1,This CD sucks,"If you are a fan of the Bronski Beat music of the 80's - then DO NOT buy this CD. Stick to ""Age of Consent"", ""Hundreds and Thousands"" and ""Truthdare Doubledare"". One of my all time favore BB sonfs was the 1986 extended dance version of ""Hit That Perfect Beat"". THe version on this CD is awful - the vocals sounds like a bad drag queen, the beat is slower than the original and even some of the lyrics have been changed (and not for the better). Save your money - don't buy this CD."
1,it sucks,"let me be honest: this CD is embarrassing. Jonathan Hellyner on vocals sounds like a drag-queen CHER. Ian Donaldson handles the sequencing and Steve Bronksi, the only member of BB to have remained over the years, is on keys. The recycled Age of Concent tracks are a joke, and the cover of ""I Love the Night Life"" is EXTREMELY weak compared to other disco covers the band did in the past. I was working at a record shop when the singles from EU came to us, and we QUICKLY put them into the bargain bins after hearing them (all the while, Age of Concent was still a decent CD and still in the regular racks). this CD is,for all intents and purposes, horrid."
4,Good for occasional use.,"The nylon is soft, so it will do what it says, which is save (the bark of) a tree. Don't install where it will move repeatedly. I hung a multi-person swing from it for one day, and after ten hours of use, the nylon was fraying where it rubbed the metal support."
4,Awesome mask. looks good and doesn't fog!,"#1 thing to love about this mask is that it doesn't fog. The thermal lens worked great! The camo print is also really nice for woodsball.The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is its not the most comfortable (its the foam inside. its a bit hard, but it doesn't feel like good quality), but certainly not terrible. The other reason is that after I played with it I tried to clean the lens by taking them out. I couldn't for the life of me get the lens out. I was able to pry off the tabs that hold the lens in at the top, but couldn't get the bottom. Not to big of a deal though.Overall a very good mask. A must for those that can't stand their mask fogging up!"
2,"Small field of view, tiny mask","Received this out of the box today, and it's going right back. It's tiny - not for an adult head. On top of that, the field of view is small also, like wearing blinders, you see nothing to the left or right, no peripheral vision on this mask, which is important in paintball. It looks like it could probably handle fog well, the lens was dual paned and thermal, but I'll never know, it's going back because of the overall small size and small field of view."
2,Kids Don't Use..,"This item makes the kids heads too hot, so they don't use it, which makes it worthless. It fits against their faces a bit less comfortably than I would have liked them to experience. They switched to a different face mask and love it (also camo). For some reason, this one just heated up too much and fogged at times."
2,Not impressed.,I have owned many paintball masks but this one seems to be made for a child. I wear a large sized hat and this mask was way too tight. It left marks on my face from the hard foam around the goggle and the band was too tight. It is very uncomfortable and gives me a headache. I switched out the band with an old goggle and it is a little more comfortable but the foam that JT uses around the goggle is not comfortable and will irritate your face. I suggest getting something other than a JT. This mask does fog some in the summer but not as bad as one without thermals.
4,Nice mask,"This is a pretty good mask. I like the camo, it seems to be plenty tough enough, my only complaint is that it cuts off your peripheral vision."
3,Not big enough for adults.,I love the look and function of this mask but it is made for a child's head. I wear a large hat and my head measures 59 centimeters and the elastic band on this helmet is too small to fit my head. This is my third JT mask and I didn't have that problem with the other two but this one is too small. I am going to cut it and add a piece of fabric to make it larger.
1,Cheap insides,"I really liked this reel until a fish hooked up that didn't have the strength to pull line against the drag, but the innards of the reel couldn't handle it. The metal gearing couldn't handle the strain of the drag! The teeth sheared off inside. Bad design, cheap metal.(and from day one, the bail wouldn't always flip)."
1,stopped working,"It seemed fine at first, not great since it has to be plugged in and has no remote control. But after a few weeks of using it, it just stopped working and won't turn on now"
2,Ipod speakers,These speakers worked good while they worked. They didn't even last a year though. The sounds keeps cutting out on them or doesn't work at all. Probably would not recommend.
4,Orb Ipod,My daughter loves this product. She says it has great sound. She highly recommends it for anyone with an Ipod.
4,Starting Point for Assessment,I was assigned this text for a class about differentiated instruction and assessment and I've found it very informative. The author looks at many types of assessment used in schools and provides reasoning behind their use with students. Examples of good assessments are provided. I can see this book being pulled out in the future to help me construct assessments for my students.
3,I'll Come at You Like A Spider Monkey!!,"3 and 1/2 stars really; I can't give a movie 4 stars if I know I'll never buy it. I'm not a NASCAR fan at all, and yet this still made me laugh. Sorry, there is no way this is 5 stars, but it defitly worth a rental or even maybe purchase (when it's down to 9.99 or less though). Even if you're not a racing fan or into redneck humor, give it a try when you're not sure what to watch one night."
3,Talladega Nights,"I cant complain at all about the price I paid for an unopened BluRay of Talladega Nights, its one of my favorite movies... My only issue is that it wasnt the Unrated Uncut version in the picture the copy that I recvd was the promotional copy that I am guessing was sold with someones PS3... It had no deleted scenes or any bells and whistles it was bare and I was almost shocked when I actually saw that it did have credits..."
3,"It had some funny parts, but over all really stupid","I dont get it when people say this movie is so hilarious. I watched it and would like to think I have a good sense of humor, but it was just so stupid. I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but this movie didnt come close to the humor in some of his other movies, like Old School."
4,It Would Be Five-Star Were It Not for the Blu-ray Transfer,"I thought this movie was incredibly funny. Lot's of great laughs. Awesome cast! What an outstanding film!This movie would have turned out much nicer if it were on HD DVD...the Blu-ray picture on this tile is a bit flat and unexciting, and the sound is just so...well, it's flat too.The shots in this film were such that you could have been drawn in, and the audio could have felt far more compelling than it did.I so highly recommend ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"". Five-star film, but sadly only a two-star or three-star Blu-ray transfer."
4,For NASCAR fans and Non-NASCAR fans alike!,"I wasn't sure how I was going to react to this film after seeing Ferrell's last release, ""Anchorman"". In that film, the film went way over the top and I was disappointed with the final result. This time around, they get it right! This film is a rip-roaring laugh riot! The real star of this film is Sacha Baron Cohen's hillarious rendition of F-1 driver turned NASCAR speed demon. He makes this film worth the price of admission! This is for NASCAR fans and Non-NASCAR fans alike!"
2,Leaves Me Cold,"Barak steals it. As the crazed Frenchy speed demon, his effeminate stereotype crushes France and Ricky Bobby, the Will Ferrell - All-American NASCAR Driver alter ego with a sloppy kiss. The rest of the film is dumb Southerners uttering stupid cliché's in standard hate-redneck speech. You think I'm kidding. No, this film is one more blast at your average red state, Bush loving, and dumb gum chewing, big boob, blonde Southern folks. That is the way those Liberals in Hollywood at their cocktail parties lambaste the suckers that buy the tickets.One more note, the arcade game look of the races and crashes has gone beyond clay models. Still, these special effects that look something like Madden Football, leaves me cold."
4,Family Loves This,"I got this for my family and they hooted and hollered all through it. I am not a big Will Ferrell fan, but this was one of his funnier movies."
1,Don't waste your time or money...,"Rarely is a movie so bad that I cannot finish it. This one was. It has bad acting, bad humor, children cussing, and even though done for parody, very bad stereotypes. I have occasionally enjoyed a movie that would be classified as stupid humor but this isn't one of them. This is definitely one to not waste your money on."
1,Idiot's Delight,I think everyone involved in this film deserves a round of applause - finally a movie made for retarded people.
1,Unrated,"It is a questionable practice for a producer to make all his protagonists completely unsympathetic. Characters ranged from driven by lust and gluttony to selfishly using others to gain quick wealth (greed and vanity). Even though the plot allows the possibility of a character arc and redemption, the main protagonist barely takes advantage of it. I initially preferred to give this zero stars, but on further consideration I think one star is justified: this movie proves to me that Sacha Baron Cohen cannot act, so I saved myself from seeing Borat. On the other hand, I give this three stars for Boring and five stars for Stupid, giving it an overall rating of four stars on my BS scale."
1,Talladega Nights,I did not care for this movie at all. I usually like Will Ferrell movies but this was way too stupid.
2,Too silly,This started out as promising but got worse as the movie progressed. I expect the under 13 viewers will have loved it but the humour was definitely targeted for those in that age group (I hope).
1,Mediocre,"If you saw the TV commercials for this movie you've seen all the funny parts. I laughed a few times, but it fell very far short of my expectations.I've lived amongst rednecks all my life, and they do some dumb things sometimes, but no one is as dumb as the characters in this movie, not even in the South.Mabye it would have been better starring Jeff Foxworthy and his Blue Collar crew instead."
2,Meh,"I'm not a Will Ferrell fan. In all fairness, the first 30-40minutes of this film were solid stretches of funny, though once a need to focus on a plot emerged, the humor became watered down in the development. The general satire of the racing (and general sports) world and celebrity life were amusing, but for the most part, about halfway through the jokes started to become rehashed and any wit was lost."
1,"Not Uncut, Horrid Pacing","The unrated version really kills the movie's pacing and actually cuts out at least two very funny scenes. Not only is the pacing thrown off by the inclusion of the ""unrated"" material, but a lot of it simply doesn't make sense with the rest of the plot line. I'm going to buy the theatrical release."
1,If only I could rate it 0 stars!!!,"Awful, just plain stupid and awful. I'm so glad I rented this as a rent one get one for free deal because this was one of the worst movies out there. And to think that these actors get paid big money to do this crap. Its a real shame. After only 30 minutes of this drivel my husband and I had had more than enough and turned the dvd off. Multiple 0 stars!!!"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0 STARS,"This was one of worst and stupid movies I have ever seen. My husband who is a die hard Nascar fan even thought this movie was beyond stupid. When the movie was over he said I can't believe you watched the whole movie. That was really bad.It should be rated R for filthy language and really bad behavior. My 6 year old watched it with us. She even said that the movie had too many bad words in it.I was going to just give my review in few word three exactlyDumb, Stupid, Crap.The movie industry has not produced a good movie in years but this was scraping the bottom of the barrel."
1,A Trainwreck,"Talladega Nights was likely one of the worst movies I've seen. I spent the entire length shaking my head in disgust. You know, it's pretty easy to make fun of Nascar. Somehow they even managed to screw that up. Just because you say something stupid VERY LOUD, does not make it funny. Little kids with foul mouths aren't original.Granted, I'm not a Will Ferrel Fan. Granted, I have good reason. I did like Stranger than Fiction, however."
1,I can not believe how BAD this movie is,"I could only watch about 20 minutes of this movie before stopping the player. When they started talking about little baby Jesus vs other Jesuses, I'd had enough. Not funny."
2,Not A Very Funny - Don't Waste Your Time,"I like Will Ferrell and have seen most of his movies. He can be very funny. Unfortunately, this movie is not especially funny. Much of the movie tries to make fun of NASCAR fans, such as showing that fine gourmet dining for NASCAR fans consists of dining at Applebees.Don't waster your time. Watch something better."
4,Hilarious spoof of NASCAR,"Like most of the other movies Will Ferrell is in that makes fun of various things (like the ones he did on ice-skating or being an anchorman), this is a funny twist and spoof on the chosen subject - in this instance NASCAR, the favorite sport of rednecks and white trash. His family dynamics are also entertaining to watch, like his kids cussing out Grandpa at the table, or his relationship with his best (and ex-best) friend. If you don't like Will Ferrell, you won't like this, but if you do like him and hate NASCAR, you will definitely enjoy this film."
2,I was expecting more....,"From Will's past movies (Elf, Old School, etc.) I thought for sure I would like this one, but it was lacking, started out funny, then just got lame. Come on Will, you can do better."
2,Not Good Enough To Purchase,"Bought this movie because we are big Will Farrell fans, but what a disappointment! We like Nascar, but we still didn't like this movie. We watched it once and that's plenty. We watched all the extras just to feel that we were getting our money's worth. It'll never get played again. Don't make the same mistake, save your $$ - rent it!"
1,Who doesn't love a good comedy?,"Apparently the makers of this movie. Generally I don't apply my 2 to movies, but I couldn't hold back on this one. One word to sum up my review: awful. I had gotten this movie for $8; thankfully I didn't pay $20, or I'd be even more upset. Even the additional ""Gag Scenes"" was painful to watch."
2,"A steaming pile of crap, and not the good kind of crap.","If a movie as pathetic as this can make millions of dollars, I'm in the wrong business. I want my 5 buck rental back. This movie was about 40 minutes too long, and even then I'm being generous.There were some funny scenes; I thought them saying grace was great, but that's about 4 minutes out of 120 (for the uncut, unrated). But other than that, the stupid scenes in this movie are boundless.It had great potential too. Explore the innards of Nascar. But why go over the top? Guys like Christopher Guest can do satires without moving into the ""stupid"" category and his movies are brilliant."
1,Worse Will Ferrell Movie Every,"The Trailer for this movie was very promising and funny. Will Ferrell has proven he can make a good movie. Two examples are ""Elf"" and ""Stranger Than Fiction"". However, this is a prime example of how a bad 2 hour movie can seem like a bad 3 hour Movie. Some scenes just went on and on. And of course we have to see two men kissing in the mouth because for some reason that's suppose to be very funny. Thank God for ""Fast Forward"" buttons and ""Rentals"". I am sadden to think of all the small children which have been exposed to this movie, especially due to the NASCAR tie-in. I think Will Ferrell gets some kind of sick perverse high from making these kind of movies. Save yourself a lot of money and let this movie pass you by. ""SHAKE N BAKE"""
1,Lame...,We were VERY disappointed with this movie. My neighbor is a huge Nascar fan and we were looking forward to seeing this. That is two hours of my life that I will never get back.
1,"Please, Baby Jesus, Don't Make Me Watch This Movie Again!","Holy pit stops was this movie bad! I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan, but I did like him in ""Old School"", and ""Anchorman"" was at least mildly amusing. After watching this, I think Will needs to go back to comedy college and take some courses over, because he is NOT nearly as funny as he is trying to be!. He took the film's premise, which wasn't bad, and wrecked it with his forced, badly timed, and overdone ""comedy"". Save yourself some pain and divert your money and time elsewhere."
3,Talladega Nights,"This movie had some funny parts, but wasn't as good as what we thought. The Nascar part of the movie just wasn't used well."
3,Watchable movie,I found this movie to be way too long clocking in at 2 hours. Maybe it was because we don't get that super crazy Will Ferrel we are used to. In fact when he does go crazy it is not all that fun like when he thinks he is on fire. BUT the director seems to take a different approach and puts in a little less comedy to put more into the story. It really doesn't work but it makes for a good endign with the family getting back together and all. Not being a fan of 'Anchor Man' I still have to say that 'Ricky Bobby' is not as good. I am stuck between a 2 and a 3 because I come to a Will Ferrel to see some the insane thigns that he does but I am a sucker for a good ending to a movie.
4,Watch out for foul language!,"I specifically got the PG-13 version thinking that it would be appropriate for my 13 yr. old nephew. Boy was I wrong!! While I, as an adult, love Will Farrell and his movies, the language on this one is horrible. The 2 sons in the movies are terrible and their language is even worse!! I would hate to think what the unrated version is like. Be warned, for an adult it's funny, for anyone under 18, I would steer clear!"
2,A must see - One Time,"This movie is funny and entertaining. However as I find with much of Will Farrell it is a one time one watch. I would definitely recommend seeing it once, but would only own it to loan out."
2,Uncut yet still rated PG-13,"I like the movie, don't get me wrong- rented the uncut. Actually scenes were cut out of the version i remember seeing in the theater. Example.. When rickey is a small child and drives his mothers car. Not in the uncut.I noticed 2 scenes which were possibly additional. Rickey bobby delivering pizzas on a bus and talking to another passanger. Secondly before his nascar says ""ME"" on it, its advertising for male thongs. Thats it- Just buy the regular version. The deleted/extended scenes are 60% of the outtakes during the credits (various spinoffs of when Rickey was in the hospital) and an extended scene of when Rickey comes home and Cal married his wife.Just don't expect anything great on the uncut version... i do not think the uncut-ness would even make the movie approach an R rating."
4,Nothing but memorable quotes.,Keeps my family laughing for days everytime we watch it. Will Ferrell's best performance. You can't stop quoting this movie.
1,Too much bad language!!,I ordered this movie for myself because I thought it would be funny. It had it's funny points but I couldn't even finish it because of the language. Very disappointed. :(
3,What you expect from Will Farrell.,"Very predictable, but funny and corny--just what you expect from a Will Farrell film. This movie is now popular among young teens in our area, with kids quoting lines from the movie, much like we did with Belushi, Chase, Murray, etc."
3,Skipped Near End,"It was a gift and the receiver said that it stopped playing near the end before the climax and she tried everything to get it to continue to run , but it just started at the beginning again, so she doesn't know how the last quarter ends. This is weird since the DVD was brand new and had never been opened. It got to where it was supposed to in great time and in great condition, so I guess the gift receiver must have done something wrong to it, because she said she had trouble getting it out of the package. I just don't know....."
1,lamer,this movie is lame at times annoying poor plot. the acting is usually poor. you may laugh yet more likely you will forget to as you're wondering why you wasted your time.
3,Whats the difference?,"I saw the movie in theaters and then I bought the unrated version. There is not much of a differnce; The only scene I saw as new was a sterotypical black man dropping a few f bombs to Ricky. Thats it? Im so sick of these unrated movies coming out. Mostly every comedy and horror film that is released today will get the ""unrated"" version with stuff that they couldnt show in theaters or so they claim. I really cant remember every buying an unrated version of a film and thinking it was better then the orignal version. As with the 40 Year Old Virgin, a comedy should not exceed more then an hour and forty five minutes. This movie is two hours and two minutes. A few funny scenes here and there but no comedy gold."
2,Thoroughly Dissapointing,"I really don't know what to say. Will Ferrell is one of my favorite comedians. Judd Apatow continues to amaze me with the movies hes involved with (Anchorman, Superbad, Knocked Up). There were other talented people involved with this movie, but it just seemed to be missing something. I couldn't laugh nearly the entire movie. The only part of the movie I remember laughing was during the part where they do adds for a bunch of weird products. Maybe I was in an off mood, but I couldn't get into this movie. I highly recommend the other Judd Apatow movies and Will Ferrell movies though."
1,Dittos: uncut version IS OVERLY CUT,"As another reveiwer stated, the extremely fitting scene of young Ricky Bobby is cut along with at least one other that I remember (the out-of-work pit crew working at a car wash).While there was some interesting, but often cumbursome extra footage, my opinion is to avoid this version and search out the ""original theatre version"""
1,ENG-FRE SUBTITLES ONLY!!!!,THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION SAYS THAT IT HAS DIFFERENT SUBTITLES BUT THE ONLY ONE IS FRENCH I ORDERED IT FOR THE SPANISH SUBTITLES BUT WHEN I GOT IT SAYS ONLY ENG-FRE SONY ALWAYS DO THAT LIKE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE HISPANIC MARKET IN THE US.
2,Making a left turn?,"This was a Xmas gift for my younger, college-aged son. He seems to really like this movie. I have not seen it, nor intend too. I am not a Will Farrel fan but he seems to have reached a niche audience. If you like him or NASCAR, it might be the right movie for you."
4,Talladega Nights-The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,This is a laugh out loud funny movie. The unrated version is a little crude for younger viewers and should definitely be previewed before showing a younger crowd. This one will make you laugh each time you watch it.
2,Not the movie that was in theaters......,"I loved this when I saw it in the theater. These two versions were recut, for some unknown reason, and are pale in conparison. Yes, it's still funny, but the editing was better on the big screen.The director's commentary is stupid and worthless. I usually like them because they give the viewer insights to how they filmed it and their take on it[for an A+example, see MIAMI VICE,just incredible, the commentary is better than the movie!!]. This comentary is a weak attempt at comedy."
3,Fun movie,"We found this movie to be generally funny, light hearted satire. The only thing that we did not enjoy, and in fact found objectionable, was the unecessary foul language they had the kids use. Would not recommend it as a family film!"
2,When will Ferrell make a funny movie?,"Dear Lord baby Jesus, sitting there in your crib watching your Baby Einstein developmental videos, learning about shapes and colors, will you please grant us a funny movie starring Will Ferrell?Will Ferrell is one funny guy, and it shows during parts of Talladega Nights...unfortunately, all that is funny also appeared in the movie's trailer. Beyond the trailer, there was very little to laugh about. This seems to be a trend for Ferrell, with Anchorman and Kicking & Screaming turning out similarly. Talladega Nights seemed like a SNL skit that dragged on a little too long, with no logical conclusion. The concept is great, who doesn't want to laugh at NASCAR. The sport practically makes fun of itself, and Ferrell's Ricky Bobby is just the type of character we can laugh at. All is needed is a few more jokes and a solid story to tie it all together...that's where Talladega falls flat."
4,Raw humor.,"Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is pure slapstick. Will Ferrell continues with his zany antics as usual but the performance that surprised me the most is Leslie Bibb who plays Ricky's over-zealous wife. Bibb is hilarious and shows range I didn't know she had since mostly she does t.v. work. John C. Reilly also flexes his comic timing and while the film has some embarrassing moments, Talladega Nighs did make me laugh. You will either love it or hate it, good luck!"
3,Kentucky Borderline,This is one of the best Will Ferral movie since Old School. It will make a nascar fan out of you. Duncan's acting is bearable also.
5,Great movie Great transfer,"This movie was very funny still laughing at certain parts. The transfer was very clean not the sharpest movie I have, however it was done very well. More so shown on the race scenes. The picture was very clean on fast moving action. Highly recommended you'll be laughing out loud in 1080p."
4,Talladega Nights,Funny funny film. Be warned however the blu ray version from Amazon Home site is region A.. it wouldnt play on region B machine ( pioneer).
2,There's a reason why they make cuts...,"It turns out that the ""13 minutes never seen in theaters"" is some of the raunchiest material in the script. The uncut version turns a hilarious, family-friendly movie into something you'll have to apologize to friends and family afterwards. Unless you're really into bedroom/bathroom humor, do yourself a favor and get the theatrical release instead of the uncut version."
4,Great flick!,"While it isn't the original movie this is a great version. Mile a minute laughs, great racing scenes and some of the best of Will Ferrell. Very uncomfortable humor mixed with slapshtick and just the right mix of numbskull hijynks for good fun. All together a great cast!"
4,Southern Comfort,"Talladega Nights is a comedy with southern flavor. I loved it. Will Ferrell and John C. Riley as usual are a great team. Talladega also reveals something NASCAR fans know, especially the ladies, and that is not only is stock car racing a sport of skill it's very sexy.Those groupies are real!Very funny, Ferrell and Riley fans will like it as well as NASCAR buffs."
2,Not bad,"Some parts are ok, but the rest is a little sleepy. I bought this movie because Will Ferrell stars in it. I like him in his movies. But this one could have been better."
2,Overstock from video rental?,"The DVD had a 'family video' label attached to it. Are they selling used videos from rental stores? The movie played well until around the 1:30 mark, when it began to hang up. Not going to buy anything else from this vendor..."
1,The worst of the worst,As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back.
1,Hated it.:(,"There is nothing funny about this movie..It is NOT a movie for children. This movie is crude, rude, and just plain awful. If studios can not come up with better films then this one, Then it's time for them to hang up their hats and find another carreer."
3,Mildly Amusing,"I can't escape the feeling that this movie should've been funnier. I got 5 really big laughs out of it, and they all involved the scenes I saw in the commercials. Cohen is pretty much wasted here, and the whole middle of the movie seemed like they ran out of ideas. Will is a funny guy, and has his moments here. But after seeing him be funnier in many other movies(not to mention the re-runs of SNL), I can't help wonder what would have happened had they spent a little more time on the script...and come up with more ideas worthy of all this talent."
1,"Please buy the theatrical version, pleeeeeeease!","I don't know what cut this is, I don't know who cut it, but there's a reason that it wasn't shown in the theatres. It's not funnier, in fact it takes every good joke remaining in this version (and many were cut in the um.. UNCUT version) and drags them out, beyond the point where all you want is the movie to end. Did I mention they cut out stuff from the theatrical version? Yup. This version doesn't make up for it by being more risque, it's not more violent, it's just stupid. The original theatrical release is much better. Even the extras are worse!"
4,depends,"Depends on your sense of humor. Some find it laugh-out-loud funny, others think it drivel. I had to watch it several times before it began to grow on me."
2,just ok,"this film wants to be a Sattire of Southern culture in terms of the Nascar circuit. it's a goofy film with enough predictable lines&scenes that either will make you laugh a bit or just feel how dumb this film is. Will Ferrell is pretty much stuck in the same role from film to film now. Sacha Baron cohen who these days is happening in film, showcases his humor. this film has alot of cliches&alot of Product placement which after a while makes you forget about the film. there are some moments,but on a whole this film is just ok at best."
2,Poor Blu-Ray Transfer,A quick opinion on the blu-ray video quality. I got this movie bundled with my PS3. It's supposed to be a good demo to show off the blu-ray technology. I found it quite the opposite. The quality cannot compare with most of the WB blu-ray movies (such as Corpse Bride).
4,Not as good as Anchorman,"There are a few funny moments in this movie, but nothing that I can remember right now even though I just watched this last night."
1,Just......eww.,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my 13 years of life. Waste of money. Seriously. I don't think I smiled once during this movie. I think I'm going to hate Will Ferrell for the rest of my life because of this movie. It has no feeling in it!! I'd give this no stars if I could. It was unrealistic and really not funny at all.I guess if you're the kind of person who likes lame slapstick comedies, you'll like this. But if you're the kind of person who likes REAL comedies, don't waste your time."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This is a bad movie. Being a NASCAR fan I thought I'd enjoy the movie but, alas, this was not to be. I freely admit to not being much of a Ferrell fan. Movies like this are the reason why! It isn't good parody. It isn't good satire. It isn't good comedy. It isn't good anything! Forget it."
1,"AWFUL, MISERABLE WASTE OF TIME","Talladega Nights had one or two laughs, but for the most part it was without any humor. It was boring and boorish. I kept expecting it to get better-it never did. My husband was so disgusted with it, he walked out and he usually loves tacky movies.I expected it to be on the same or even better caliber as ""My name is Earl"". Not even close. I give Earl and A and Talladega as low a score as possible. Way less than an FI should have followed my husband's lead and turned off the DVD and spent my time better by watching paint dryIf you are a NASCAR fan, you might enjoy the racing scenes. I am not and even I saw some bloopers in the movie. It seems the producers didn't even care enough to take them out.-but if they had it wouldn't have improved the movie-so I can see why they didn't bother"
2,I like Will Farrel but...,"This movie was just stupid and not very funny. Id say this was nearly as bad as bewitched as far as jokes go. Maybe it was just that it was over-hyped, but I thought it really sucked."
4,NASCAR pokes fun at itself,Mandatory viewing for anyone moving to North Carolina.Good laffs all the way!
3,Stupidly funny,Rating is more like 2.5. Like alot of others I felt it should have been funnier with Will Ferral as the lead. The previews showed the funniest moments in the movie. IMO his kids Walker and Texas Ranger were the funnier characters in the movie. Its worth renting but not purchasing
2,Why is Will Ferrell so Popular?!,"That's what you'll be asking yourself after watching another one of his possibly well-intentioned yet unfunny comedies. Yes, he was funny on SNL given the very limited playing time of sketch comedy. But this is feature film land here and he just isn't very funny over a 2-hour feature length film. My favorite part of the film was Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's daddy. I don't think this man gets enough credit. He has given surprisingly daring, unpredictable performances in film as well as television for like the last 20 years. And I LOVE Sacha Baron Cohen, but disagree that he was so good in this film. He was okay, but next to the lame antics of Ferrell & Reilly anybody would have come across like a comic genius. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Uncut is a big lie,In the first two minutes of the film you can see that their uncut statement is false since they cut out the scene with young Ricky taking his mothers car for a drive. If you want what you saw at the theaters don't buy this version and hunt down the rated one.
2,Talladega Disappointment,"Parts of this movie are pure genius...but only parts. It gets a little too ridiculous elsewhere, and your suspension of disbelief must be employed for all the characters. Who's the straight-man in this comedy anyway?!"
3,Talladega nighs,Talladega Nights was funny for a comedy and race movie. But I do not recommend it for children under 13 years of age. Because of the the sexual scenes and language.
4,A great ride for the entire family,"It has the flair of ""Dodgeball"" with a little ""Starsky and Hutch"" style humor. The characters are so serious about their triumpts that they are ridiculously funny and disfunctional. We like the fact that Ricky prays and gives thanks at the table. Even if he chooses to pray to the tiny baby 6-month-old Jesus (cause that's his favorite Jesus). The words that come out of his mouth just keep us laughing and grinning real big like. Ricky IS number 1."
2,Obnoxious,"While it does have a couple funny scenes, most of it is just plain obnoxious. Definitely not for children or people who don't appreciate the more vulgar side of life (myself included). I gave it two stars because it will appeal to those who don't mind such brashness."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I watched this movie on a plane from California to Hawaii and it was embarassingly awful. The only amusing portions of the movie are shown in the trailor - so watch the trailor, but avoid giving more money to Hollywood for junk like this. I hate to stereotype, but I have to believe that if you found this movie hillarious, you probably are a few mcnuggets from a happy meal."
3,"Pretty funny, but only once. Blu-ray version did not look that great.","Pretty funny movie, had me cracking up when I first saw it in the theaters. Got a good deal here on Amazon so I thought what the heck. I laughed a few times still watching at home, but wasn't nearly as funny the second time around. Some parts are ad-libbing genius while others are just plane stupid (like Will Ferrel running around in his underwear thinking he's on fire). The blu-ray disc showed off some of the crappy camera work. The sun was just too bright on the track and made things look kinda hazy. You know that almost 3-D look you get in HD? Well this movie had none of that going on. So, it's not the greatest, but hey, I got it for 10 bucks so I can't complain."
5,"""Best Movie Ever Made"" - Ricky Bobby","this movie is so funny, and what makes it better is the unrated extra content on the dvd! Love this movie"
3,"Starts great, but soon becomes a sleeping pill.","Most SNL style comedies follow this basic formula:First 30 minutes: If the concept is funny, the first 30 minutes are funny.Second 30 minutes: Movie realizes, ""oh crap, we need to have some sort of story here ... hmm ... uh ... ok, let's have the main character overcome some obstacles in pursuit of a goal.""Final 30 minutes: Awful, awful, awful.This movie was no different. The first 30 minutes were very, very funny. Farrell is a genuinely gifted comedic actor, and John C. Reilly was so good, he nearly stole the show.But then the movie just crapped out. This movie was at its best when it made fun of NASCAR and at its worst when it tried to tell a story. As with most SNL comedies, this movie was a sketch comedy about an hour too long.Ugh, I wish I could give this more than 3 stars, but the last half of the movie was so boring that my wife and I both fell asleep. It's a shame."
1,Save YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE ORIGINAL,"What happened? They cut out all of the funny scenes. They made this version more crude, and lewd. Other unrated movies have been more successful but this one its like watching a whole different movie. Please save your money and buy the original because that is classic Will Ferrell."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to purchase this item. It was a Christmas Present for my boss. He opened it this morning, still sealed from the factory. It does not talk! The batteries were all corroded!!! We are ordering batteries but I'm not sure that will even help because there was corrosion on the connector also. I am so disappointed!!!!"
1,Ick!,What a complete disappointment. One star was too generous. This is a schlocky piece of supposed Judaica. The maker should hang his head in shame. Inferior materials and construction. I returned it.
3,oh crudz,"hey, the girl that wrote the review wait 4 felicia, AGAIN..JUST GO TO THE PEOPLES SITE THAT MAKES BRATZ (MGA ENTERTAINMENT) AND CLICK ON PRODUCTS THAN BRATZ!"
3,hey,i am the girl who wrote the wait 4 felicia review if u want to see her go to [...] and go to products then bratz then campfire!
1,huh?,"This toy is supposed to be for camping? I live in Montana, so I would know how to camp. You DEFINENTLY dont wear this kind off clothes camping! I mean, high heeled shoes>? This is stupid!"
2,LOSER!,"On the bratz TV show they act all slutty and they talk like this:Like OMIGOSH we like, like boys and like,like shopping. And one show one of the bratz was shopping and started dancing really weirdly next to a random boy on the STREET. HUH?! why, is what i wonder they're lives don't revolve around friendship they revolve around shopping, clothes, boys, and perfect hair. They have stupid looking lips and they always wear slutty clothes. i was really sad when her head fell off a week after i got my doll. so i just ditched bratz. I do not recommened these dolls and to the person who said they revolve around friendship.....you need a physcologist! Because you're nuts they're plastic and on the TV show they are animated."
1,Boycott Bratz,"Bratz dolls are sooooo stupid. I have nothing against pretend play, but the dolls are dumb. They have tiny skirts up to their bottoms and the Rock Angel dolls have tattoos. Maybe girls will eventually move away from them, but for now, what are little girls learning??????? That they should wear tiny skirts and that fashion is more important then anything else. I don't see ""Love to Share"" Bratz or see Bratz movies about being nice."
4,Um...pretty cute but....,"Adorable doll, i would buy it but the fact that they wear HEELS while camiping is weird! And AGAIN GROW UP!!!!!! It's DOLL!!!!! i prefer my scene......because they are better quality..in my opinion, and the other fact is that they're heads fall off easily (bratz) well okaybyeCP"
1,The process of ripping someone off,"If you are a true I Mother Earth fan, this album won't appeal to you, here's why.Many of you have probably heard about the ""rarities and b-sides"" package that EMI is planning to release later this month. It's important to us that you know that we have nothing to do with it and do not endorse it's release. It's all stuff that most of you probably already have or is available for download so it's obvious that it's just a cash grab from our former record company.Thank you for your support.I Mother EarthThat just about says it all. Enjoy the stuff they released when they approved of it!!"
3,I Mother Earth - 'Earth Sky & Everything Between' (EMI) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent compilation of the I Mother Earth's early repertoire - of material that most fans likely already have. For example, ""Levitate"" and ""So Gently We Go"" are off of 'Dig' and ""Pisser"" and ""Used To Be Alright"" are off 'Scenery And Fish"". True, these are unreleased and acoustic versions of these songs (and even though) this CD has Edwin back on vocals - I'd still recommend it pretty much for the die-hard fans."
1,Another thrown together piece of trash,This video producer thought they could squeeze musicians by slapping together parts of other videos. Steer clear this series is pure trash.
5,Extremelly practical,"Very useful little gadget. I can now have all my USB devices connected to my computer, and I don't even need the AC power adaptor. If you have few USB ports in your motherboard or simply have too many USB devices, this is perfect!"
1,Dynex DX-4P2H waste of money!,This thing worked for a couple of weeks then the top two ports quit working and now I am having trouble with the back ports as well. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Very poor performance.
1,Didn't work for my computer,I don't know if my older (2000) compaq presario with windows me was just to old for this thing but it never worked. The top ports never worked and the back ports worked for my keyboard and printer until I tried to plug my camera into a port on the top and then my whole computer crashed. The only way I could get it to reboot was by unplugging the hub. I was never able to get it to work with my computer again without crashing.
1,It's more like a 2 Port USB Hub...,"It worked for a couple of moths then the top two ports quit working!. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap. I just ordered aPlugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter)by Plugable Technologies, It's Rated 4.7 out of 5 stars with a 1,053 reviews!"
1,...more like a 2-port hub,"Within a few weeks of purchasing this product, the top two ports stopped working. This is a malfunctioning piece of equipment; nobody should purchase it."
2,stopped working suddenly after 1 year,"Yes, it was inexpensive, but the time I spent trying to read my flash drive and 3 other things plugged into this was expensive. I advise buying something different or buying 2 of these to have a backup. Very frustrating to wait for another to arrive."
1,Works great until it breaks,"This product is a standard 4 port hub, and it worked very well for me... and then it just stopped. Didn't touch it, didn't mess with it, and one day the top 2 ports stopped working. I was interested to see that others had experienced the same thing so I had to ad my own experience. I had this thing for about a year. But a device with no moving parts and no frequent plugging & unplugging of the ports not be failing. Be warned. If I thought my case was unique, I would not have submitted this review. I add my story to those already posted."
1,Thumbs Down,"This is a documentary with two men tell there story about aliens,area 51 and the autopsy. Almost the whole film is about these guys opinions. The video footage sucks. I could do better with my $100 camera and I'm talking about the interview with these guys. You can find something much better on discovery channel or free online."
1,High Quality but Tight Fit,"The overall quality of the carrying case is very high and it protects the notebook very well. Plenty of room for accessories and the usual ""road warrior"" items. What ruins it for me is that my 15.4"" widescreen notebook is a very tight fit. The notebook slides into the case fairly easily, but once it's in, the case grips the notebook so tightly that it is very difficult to remove it. The case is designed so that the zipper opening is a ""clamshell"" arrangement and the notebook is held in a thin elastic pocket in one of the case halves rather than more in the middle. You need to maneuver the notebook past the stiff material in the top of the case half and the zipper itself to remove it from the case. It's really easy to drop the notebook or scratch it on the zipper while strugling to get it out of the case. Overall, it's a very big design flaw for an otherwise nicely made case."
4,Empowerment through Reiki,"As a student of Reiki, and having taken Reiki I and Reiki II, I am preparing for Reiki III. Empowerment through Reiki is required reading. Now after reading it, I am surprised that someone hadn't recommended it to me before. Reiki is powerful stuff and so is this book."
4,good for motivated and self-directed learning style,"Like his other books, this is a great resource for analysis/study. It is not, however, for those who want to read what someone has to say about chess rather than study the positions on their own.It is available at Amazon france site, www.amazon.fr, where I purchased it for 29 euros."
3,Even cheaper,"Hi,I also got this is TelAviv, it was on sale for 59 sheks, I though why not. When I got to the casheir I saw that I got 30% off meaning I payed 41 sheks (about $9).Besides that point I totally agree with the previous reviewer."
1,Amateur video,"I saw this video and found it quite amateurish. There is a rare big game hunting scene. Instead this looks more like a ornithology study of the birds visiting the etosha national park. If one sits with a handicam at a pond near one's home, he can catch many of the birds against insect interactions himself.Not worth the price. Pure amateurish product this one."
2,"OK, I guess...","This DVD is sort of a disappointment, primarily due to its very short running time - 1/2 hour. The material presented by each guitarist is very brief, with the James Burton and Brian Setzer segments being the longest. It is not really coherent. I think Hot Licks could have pulled a lot more material together and made a better product.What is presented is just too short and lacks any type of context."
1,Item discontinued or unavailable,"This seemed like a perfect addition to my order at a very reasonable price, and I even received an estimated delivery date. After about three weeks, I received a message indicating this product was no longer available, and my order had been cancelled. Too bad. Looked like a good deal."
3,Nikon Accessory Pack,"I wish I had read the dimensions of the bag, before placing the order. I travel a lot, and this bag is just too bulky for airline travel. It's HUGE!The bag will be used now for car travel, and for storing the camera."
5,it delivers what it promises,"This case is exactly what you'd expect, which is a good thing. the case is of good quality, about the size of a camcorder case with room for lenses. it comes with a uv haze filter AND a spare battery? i never looked back on this purchase."
4,Good but small,"I was thrilled with the bag for the first 5 months, it is exactly what I wanted, but I grew out of it a bit quicker than expected. The camera and all cables fit, but the second lens....not so much."
3,Good Referene,"Handy guide that you can take along. Not sure if needed to be so small. You really don't find ornamental grasses in the 'wild'. Ultimately, good for readers that have an interest."
5,small book - big info!,This little book is everything I heard it would be - a perfect compliment to the larger color encyclopedia. Rick Darke has done a wonderful job for those of us who don't have access to so much first hand info.
5,Only game in town,"Got lots of tidbits and names of the Merrick etc. clan. Lots of good stuff. Could be a little better organized, but I REALLY appreciate the effort that went into this."
3,What fans do...,"Ok, so I've read a ton of this guy's books, and thus have become a huge fan. He's great! But this one is a little boring, I'm sorry. It wasn't bad at all, but it just didn't have the usual spark that his novels hold."
4,Good and evil,"Charles did a better job with this one for going to the ""dark side."" He weaves and interesting tale involving the gypsy lore."
3,Overall not bad,"this product was alright, especially given the price. the only issue i had with it was the handle. the ""two handed"" handle was awkward, and could not be used with both hands wielding the blade with any comfort. it has a handle that matches the contours of one's grip creating a fixed grip that doesn't yield to the way one holds a two handed blade"
2,Not worth it,"This unit was a dissapointment, it workedfair or good at best but broke early. More junk for the heap..."
3,Good Product,"For the price, this product was worth it. The dual tank -one side for water, the other for mouthwash is nice. It can be a bit messy because it can be difficult to control the water. Overall, it serves its purpose."
1,Lasted less than warrentee period.,"Intially this product worked excellently. Gradually, pieces started to fail. Button control failed. Returned unit and received a replacement. New unit power stream control failed after warrentee period out. Buy it as a throwaway if you can afford it.!"
1,"Help, I Can't Make It Stop","This Water Jet has a button on the handle just like the WaterPic. You push it to temporarily stop the flow of water. Here's a warning: it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow. If you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine. I don't have a finger strength problem yet several times I've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow I hadn't pushed hard enough on the stop button.I had purchased a WaterPik, but had trouble with it leaking, and so purchased this Conair. The WaterPik is a much better quality product. The Conair seems to be very cheaply made, and I am not very happy with it. I am going back to using my WaterPik even though it occasionally springs a leak."
3,Dual tank is hard to switch,"The switch for the dual tank is too small, and since the base is very light it's impossible to switch with one hand while you're holding the pik with the other hand.The water pressure was disappointing with the ""standard"" head and the water tank runs out far too quickly with any but the fine point head."
2,Adequate,"This device works ""OK"". Jet stream is moderate. Noise is considerable. Has a lot of attachments that really don't do much. I'm not sure what the brushes even do. The dual tank function is pretty good. But lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part."
2,conair water pik,"I originally purchased this item after getting my wisdom teeth removed (after healing, but before the spaces filled in). It did the job getting the food out of the spaces, and then I started using it regularly because I liked the other benefts of using a water pik. I have been blessed with great teeth, but I have never been one to get myself to floss, this does a great job of replacing flossing, but it also does a great job leaking all over my bathroom counter. I did get a good year out of it, so for the price that's ok. I am going with a Waterpik model that is rated better, but a little more costly, now that I know I will keep using it."
1,Horrible design,"Low pressure water and bad design make this a junker.Low pressure: you will not be able to clean much of anything from your teeth.Bad design: Lifting up the water container and putting back in place will most likely cause the useless accessory nozzles to go flying about your bathroom, so instead of cleaning your teeth, you are on your knees looking for the little white cheaply made pieces of plastic.Whoever designed this should be fired."
