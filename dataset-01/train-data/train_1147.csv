1,"Fragile piece of junk, horrible customer service at waterpik","Very cheap and fragile piece of junk. Noisy, messy and obnoxious. We broke one of the tips right away. Went to the water pik website to order replacement parts. That was a real maddening experience. They charged me $12 for a cheap, tiny plastic part and ended up sending the wrong part. Then they want me to pay to send it back, even though they agree it was their mistake. No phone number listed on their website so good luck getting to speak with anyone and the email takes about 2 days to get a response. The only thing worse than this product was the customer service."
2,Disappointingly cheap plastic holder.,"In many ways this is an acceptable unit. It holds enough water to give a good cleaning, easy to dial up water stream strength. My big complaint is that the bracket that holds the wand is made from incredibly cheap and brittle plastic. My daughter tipped it forward onto the counter when she was using it and the tip of the right side bracket snapped off. Without the full bracket, the wand will not stay in place. Now it takes up quite a bit of room on the counter since the cord will not stay nicely coiled and the unit is much less attractive. Annoying that something so little can diminish the value and usability of an entire product."
3,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,"This Waterpik dental water jet really does cleans your teeth due to the adjustable high pressure water that shoots through your gum. Be careful not to let it hit your tongue or throat unless if you use the tongue scraper head. It also claims a quiet operation. However, the noise is so loud that my family can hear it operates out in the living room. This makes me wonder how loud the cheaper Waterpik models can get..a V8 engine???"
4,works as advertised,"Good: it actually works. Does a good job at cleaning, especially if you have braces.Bad: it is loud! The little pump really pumps but you can control the pressure which controls the noise level."
4,waterpik,"A very good product, except that the housing is very thin plastic. It needs to be handled with care. It does everything as advertised."
3,Good design but wimpy,"The overall appearance is a big improvement over previous waterpiks. The water tank is more secure. The handle is well designed. The controls are easy to use. Unfortunately, the most important feature of all is the water pressure, which is terrible. You can get a stronger water jet from the waterpik hand held unit. Why bother to have a pressure control if the top pressure isn't very strong to start with? Why under-power the most expensive model you sell?"
4,"good product, attractive and worthwhile","One gripe is that the water tank is a little smaller than I would have preferred and runs out before I am totally done. However, this is the price to pay for the applicance being on the smaller side and attractive looking in the bathroom. Basically, it's enough to get the job done and you can refill if you need another round. I generally put a touch a Listerine into the tank to give the water that refreshing tingle. My second gripe is that the water pick head comes loose because of the huge release button where you hold it. This is weired when you you in the middle of a session. The pressure adjustments are great because you will need to start on the light settings and build up so you gums don't bleed to much. This thing is powerful and works as described. I'm thinking of getting another one for the weekend house because I'm addicted."
2,Damage control,"I didn't have problems with the noise, amount of water or anything like that. My issue was that it destroyed my gums. The only times this cleaned my teeth where my toothbrush couldn't, was after eating popcorn. Other than that, it did not help and it destroyed my gums. I kept it on the lowest settings and have very healthy gums otherwise, but they became torn up after using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. I have family members that have used them in the past when they had braces, but other than maybe in that instance, I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,good waterpik,Works great really makes your mouth & teeth feels so clean the only reason for not giving 5 stars is it only comes with 1 regular pik the other 5 are specialized and for a family you have to purhase addt'l pik heads.
5,great product,The waterpik works great. I have never owned one before but glad I made the purchase. I would highly recommend it.
2,not durable,My Mom brought wp-100 few monthes ago for me. It worked great for braces and then the handle leaked. Now I got the new replaced one and hope it can last!
3,Water Pik,Looks very nice with extra tools for alternative uses. Doesn't seem powerful enough like the old model which I used for many years. It appeared to be the best on the market at the moment.
5,Excellent,"I love this waterpik - I highly recommend to anyone. It's quite, the speed ranges are perfect for any user."
3,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,I purchased this to replace a 20 year old model that I am having a hard time finding replacement water pick when they ware out. The new one works ok but I like the design and features of my old one. Had not choice but to get the new onw.
4,Good Product for a great Price,"One of my friends introduced me to this one. I never liked flossing as it takes so much of time, but with this water flosser, flossing is fun and I would be done in like 2 min. Best part was when I went to the dentist for my regular check up, he said my teeth are clean and asked me what I am doing and to continue doing it."
4,Pretty Good,"The first ""flosser"" had to be replaced within a couple of weeks because it leaked, (Waterpik replaced at no charge) but the subsequent one has worked fine. I wish it had more tips like the old ones -- the set up is a little awkward and hard to turn on/off/adjust with one hand."
5,Waterpic,"Wow, so much easier than the old string floss. Sometimes, regular floss still does a better job loosening debris, then the Waterpic flushes it out very efficiently. This is well worth the money."
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"Works fine given the following limitations; resivour is too small, i have to fill 1 & 1/2 times to clean at 2 seconds between teeth. The high power is too weak, should be increased."
4,Good product,"I received my water-pik a couple of weeks ago, and I love it. I had a water-pik before this one, for about 40 years. It still worked , but the tips leaked and I could not find replacements.My only complaint is more of the standard tips should be included for more than 1 user."
4,Great Product,"This is a great product. The only thing negative I have to say about it is that it is a little difficult to use at first. The water pressure is so strong that you have to learn to control the device, or else you'll have water everywhere. After a couple attempts it is easy to use."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this waterpick for my mom and she loved it!!!!! It works great, super cleans your teeth and also it is great for the gums. It is very light weighted and fits everwhere in the bathroom. I totally recommend it. We also love that it comes with 6 diferent ""sticks"" and other features so, noone has to share... Also, it looks really nice because of the compartment on the top so you don't have all those sticks flying around :)"
2,Good News! The OLD STYLE WaterPik is back!!!,"I just bought a brand new 'old style' WaterPik (model WP-60) at Target for $39. They also sell the new models with the smaller reservoir (the model folks are complaining about), but now they also have the old fashioned model available. It looks exactly like WaterPiks used to look like except the water reservoir is blue plastic instead of clear plastic. Same size, same shape, everything is exactly the same. I was so thrilled to find this because I didn't want the rinky-dink new model, so I'm passing the information along. If Target has it, it's probably widely available...........but the good news is that it IS available!Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser"
3,Not an improvement over earlier models,The reservoir is too small and the horizontal on/off switch is not as convenient as the vertical switch on earlier waterpiks. This product comes with a whole array of tips that waterpik would like to sell replacements for but only one standard tip (contrary to the Amazon product descriptions which indicated 2 or 3 standard jet tips). What this means is that if a family purchases this item the first thing they have to do is order extra standard picks for each family member at $5 each.
1,Richard,"Worthless! I've used waterpiks for 30 years and have owned a number of them. The pressure of this unit is so low that I doubt it removes anything. Also, the water tank is so small that it must be refilled 2-3 times to do a complete cleaning. Frankly, I've had many Waterpik models and have been very satisfied with them all- until now. Buy anything else other than this unit!"
5,best customer service experience ever,"I used my unit for a while then I put aside, thinking my teeth is good enough. (Actually I never had a problem with my teeth before.)Now I developed this swollen gum so I decided to give it a try. However, I found the unit refused to start...Then I wrote them a email. Guess what, they told me a new unit is on its way. Consider it has be more than 2 years, it is the best service I have ever seen!Cannot wait to use it again."
4,Easy to use,Bought this product for my husband who has new dental implants. It's much easier than flossing & I use it too. Gets the job done quickly & efficiently.
4,Happy with product,"Our family is very happy with our WaterPik purchase. it has really helped us to keep our teeth cleaner, especially where I have some gaps in between my molars from having my teeth straightened with braces. I wish I would have known about this while I had my braces on. It would have made it so much nicer to clean in between the brackets everyday."
5,Gums feel better,"I purchased this Waterpik because I have periodontal disease and was told by my dentist that I needed to clean better using this device. He was right! It works great. Having 6 tips included in the package is a plus, I use three of them daily. Never thought I would actually clean my tongue but with the correct attachment it is easy and works well. My gums had developed pockets of 6+ and were sore but after using this for a week with the pocket tip they felt almost normal. Works best after flossing. Not much water runs down your hand/arm; I was surprised that it wasn't very messy. Brushing is a snap afterwards. Would definitely recommend this water flosser."
4,evaluate the water pik,I am very pleased with this unit. A great improvement over previous available units.
5,Dentist recommended it,My dentist recommended I get a Waterpik so I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price (and I trust their purchase dept). Great product and price.
4,Good,"Well at least I thought this will be great for my 7-year-old to clean her braces and it was recommended to us by her orthodontist, however, my husband thought I was crazy to seriously put this into the hands of our 7-year-old and reachable for our 5-year-old who likes to figure out how everything works. So I returned it to prevent water 'gun' fights in our kids bathroom. When they are older and my daughter will need her second stage of braces though, I am pretty sure I will give this a try again."
4,Proper mouth care,This is the second one we purchase and every day we keep thanking for this invention. It helps proper mouth cleaning by forcing water to reach everywhere in the gums
3,So so,Bought this for my 11 yo son who just had his braces...it helps but does not completely clean in between teeth. Too messy to use. Regular flossing is still recommended.
4,working out fine,Product has surpassed my expectations. I will continue using it. I would recommend to people that they try it. Bye
4,Better than flossing for me,I bought this to replace the previous version of the waterpik. At first I noticed that I was running out of water before I finished. I found that having the setting a little lower uses less water and actually provides enough water pressure to do a good job. I like that this updated model makes less noise and that all the tips store in the lid. I do wish that the lid fit better on the water reservoir.
4,Works well,I purchased this waterpic based on other reviews that were very favorable towards it. I Like it. It seems to work well and easily.
2,Just fair...,"I thought my original water pik was more powerful. This one, although more compact, does not clean as well. I was disappointed."
4,Errors before reviews,"Just could not master the use of techniques, given before the review is incorrect.This product can be between the teeth in the meat dishes at the end with water rushed out.5 minutes, if the maximum power to calculate, with two boxes of half water, enough for two teeth."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"Compared to previous models, this item is a joke. The motor is so weak, even cranking it up all the way won't generate much pressure. Worse, it only holds maybe 90 seconds worth of water. This means it constantly has to be refilled while in use. Waterpik really failed with this model."
1,Waterpik Flosser,I have one of these already and I bought this one for my wife. The shipping was quick and it was free! However the product did not work right-it had very little pumping power even at the full setting. I returned the product to Amazon. The return process was easy to do and it was a hassle free experience.
2,water pik,I am not satisfied with this but am keeping it because I do like cleaning my teeth with a water pik.. The problem is that the water adjustment even tho it goes to 10 it is just not strong like the other one that I bought yrs ago that looks just like this .. I think one other review said the same thing ..They did something in that the adjustment is just not very strong on these anymore...
4,Very Good Waterpik ULTRA Water Flosser Purchased from Amazon.com,"My Waterpik ULTRA Waterflosser is excellent, except for 2 minor annoyances: (1) The lid for the Tip storage too easily opens when removing to put the water into the container; (2) The Tip holder rotates too readily while using to floss my teeth."
1,Out with the new,"I bought this to replace an older model that finally gave out after 10 years or so, well this one has nowhere near the power of the old one. Plus I do like like the design at all, I would not buy this again."
4,My Water Pick,"Love my water pick. I have had it for over a month and now I use it at least twice a day. If I skip one day, I feel very uncomfortable. My gum is no longer bleeding and mouth feels fresh all the time. I'm very happy with this item."
4,Not as powerful as old Waterpik,Product arrived promptly and in good condition. It works fine but I agree with the other reviewer comments on this being less powerful then the Waterpik we had for the last eight years. We like our Waterpiks and will get used to this one but would have appreciated the extra power.
3,Not sure whether this works...?,"I bought this product after my last dentist appointment. My dentist said that I needed to floss regularly and I was doing so, but apparently that wasn't enough. I saw the reviews on Amazon for this product and decided to give it a try.I have had it for about a month now and am still uncertain about how well it works. I floss after using this machine and I see that the machine doesn't take out everything. I am going to keep using this machine until my next dentist appointment to see whether it has made any difference..."
2,Lasted 9 Months,"Works well enough, but not nearly long enough. It has a very strong spray if you want it and it gets the job done, but for $50 it should last longer than this. There is some kind of gasket leak on the piece you hold in your hand and it has left the unit with very little pressure."
5,Wonderful,"I just received my waterpik in the mail, and I must say that I was pleased with the results. I love the settings, and found 10 to be powerful. I am pleased with this merchandise."
2,JUNK!!,"BAD DESIGN AND IT IS VERY LOUD,MESSY,AND THE HOSE IS ALWAYS TANGLING UP. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!"
3,Watchout for Appliance Voltage,"This Water Flosser is operated under electrical voltage of 110V ONLY.This piece of important information can hardly be found at the bottow of the flosser, and can only be visible by using a magnifying glass. This appliance is not suitable to be used outside USA. Hazardous results like causing electric shock, short-circuit or even fire may happen."
3,Couldn't work,My fault actually. I tried the wrong AC voltage amplitude on the machine and it immediately short circuited so I don't know if it works.
1,it never freakin worked at all!,im so pissed i was excited to use this and i followed directions and nothing the turner didnt even feel like it was hooked to anything no water flow no nothing the water even came out of the bottom not out of the pike i want my money back or ill sue
5,the best water flosser on the market,"the waterpik ultra is far superior to any water flosser we have ever used. i use this waterpik at least once daily and sometimes twice. my dental hygienist has noticed a difference in staining and gum health since i started using it. the water stream is a STRONG pulsating stream. on high setting it's so powerful it hurts when aimed wrong into your cheek or back of your throat. but that's fine because the power is what you want to wash out all the plaque building particles between your teeth and gums. for me, the water pressure is like the water pressure in a shower--it can never be too strong.i also pour a little listerine in with the water and after using it, my mouth feels like it just got a cleaning at the dentist's office. excellent product--will definitely purchase again when the old one wears out."
4,excellent product.,basic model recommended by periodontist. Read a lot of negative reviews about that model as well as all of the models. This model available on amazon for a few bucks more so went with it and love it. Forget the negative reviews. Seems a bit delicate in construction so just hope it lasts a while. Will order another for my other location.
5,Works Like a Miracle,"If you are having problems with your gums, this is the product to try. Stop using tooth paste and mouth wash with saccharine and start using the Waterpik. It worked so well for me that I purchased a second one for a friend. Use it twice a day and after a few weeks you will be surprized at how healthy your gums will become."
3,Loud Waterpik,"This waterpik serves it's purpose for someone who doesn't floss. However, it is very loud and will wake up others in the house so you really have to plan out a time making it hard to form a routine. There are lots of different tips to figure out as well. Not as simple as expected."
4,waterpik ultra water flosser,"In the begining it's hard to get total efficiency of it, but as you get used to, it becomes very easy to handle. I liked it very much. The waterpick is very useful."
4,mostly good,"A neat looking device. Much quieter than the earlier model. Larger water capacitywould be useful. Two each of the narrower nibs so that husband and wife could make useof them independently. Overall,I like using it."
1,No Power,"I have owned Waterpik's before, and was satisfied. This model has NO power! At max strength of 10, it is still very weak. I would have returned it, but I missed the return deadline by one day. Bummer.I loved my previous model as it had the power to blast junk from between my teeth. This one is basically a gentle massage in comparison - does nothing for the gums in my opinion.Waterpik has gone down hill. Check out other options, or be prepared to return it if it is of lower power/quality, like mine."
3,disappointed,"I bought this to replace the previous waterpik because the hose on the old one gave out and, apparently, there is no way to repair it. Because of the design of the new one, the height of the pik obstructs the door of the medicine cabinet and it is a hassle. Also the water well holds a much smaller quantity meaning it has to be refilled during each use. Not happy with this one although it is more expensive than the previous model."
1,Viva old waterpic's; Waterpic reliabilty on these new machines is poor.,"I replaced a twenty five year old waterpic with a new generation machine only to discover that they leak, customer service is poor, and two replacements lasted about six months each before leaking. Tired of the cost and hassle of returning bad units to water pic I found a setup that hooks up to your shower head. It's cheaper ($30) and extremely reliable and has a wide range of pressure settings. The only downside is it doesn't pulse. I got it at Amazon and highly recommend it over any waterpic product."
1,"Lousy Build, even lousier customer Service","After 6 weeks, the handle broke. Contacted manufacturer by Email - they responded 10 days later. Promised replacement handle in 10-15 days. A month later, no handle. No response to new Email.I remember when these were better made and lasted years."
5,Water Pic great purchase for clean Teeth and Gums,My dentist suggested that I get a dental flosser/maintenance device. I purchased this Water Pic thingy and so far I have not been dissapointed. My teeth and gums feel clean and free of the annoying food particles that get stuck in between and around my teeth. The device is easy and quick to use and it is not messy. The most important thing is to set the pressure to a comfortable level.and to get all of the teeth. I am giving one to my Brother as a gift.
3,good for 13 yo with braces,"Purchased for my 13 yo old son with new braces who thinks that brushing his teeth is optional.Easy to use. A bit messy (water everywhere and leaks if he isnt careful with the nozzle) but overall, we have been happy.Price is reasonable.Would have liked a longer cord. I am trying to figure out a way to get him to use it in the shower."
1,BEWARE OF MOLD,"After using the Waterpik for a month I decided to take it apart and clean it. I was letting it dry out well but thought about the hose and wondered how it completely emptied. Well I got my answer-it doesn't. After rinsing it out with vinegar, large black speckS of dried up mold spewed out. It was very upsetting. After 3 filled container attempts I could not get the hose to run with clear water. I threw it out. BEWARE!"
3,Waterpik,"Don't love the water splashing everywhere but perhaps I'll get used to it eventually. Does the job it's supposed to do, however."
3,IT IS NOT THE MOTOR/ENGINE. PLASTIC TUBES,I HAVE BOUGHT 5-6 IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. YOU CAN RELY ON ON THE MOTOR.NOT ON THE PLASTIC TUBES. USE A LITTLE BRICOLAGE AND EXCANGE THE TUBESUSE SALINE SERUM ( LIKE IN HOSPITALS) AND EXCHANGE THE TUBES.IT WORKS. WHEN MADE IN THE USA EVEN THE PLASTIC TUBES LASTED...!!
5,A SPA FOR YOUR TEETH & GUMS,"THE WATERPIK IS EASY TO USE, COMPACT IN SIZE, AND POWERFUL IN REMOVING DEBRIS FROM YOUR TEETH AND GUMS. FLOSSING BECOMES A TRUE SPA EXPERIENCE! IF YOU ABSOLUTELY DETEST THE TEDIOUS TASK OF THREAD FLOSSING, YOU WILL LOVE THE WATERPIK. WATERPIK MAKES FLOSSING FAST AND FUN! THIS COMPACT MODEL OFFERS A VARIETY OF WATER PRESSURE. A GREAT ORAL MASSAGER- WATERPIK MODEL WW100"
3,Nice product with plenty of jet power,"This product is only average because of 2 considerations. First of the unit starts to run the moment you turn it on from the base. The button on the jet handle is actually to shut the jet. (Versus having the button turn on the jet) This design is stupid in my opion because to turn it on or off you need to have one hand holding the handle button down and the other to switch the base. Otherwise you better make sure the jet wasn't pointing at some electrical outlet when you switch the base on.Second of all, the water reservoir is relatively small if you run the output at more than 50% power. You may need a refill before you finish the entire mouth. Coupled with the first problem of running all the time instead of on demand, one has to work through all areas very quickly."
4,Not Any Bettr Than The Less Expensive Versions,"This water pik does what it is supposed to do, but it isn't any stronger or better than the cheaper versions I have owned in the past. Perhaps someone with a very sensative mouth would appreciate the feature where you can turn down the force of the water jet, but if you are just looking for a full-strength pik you are wasting your money buying this deluxe version."
3,Good while it lasted. Hose snaps apart after couple of years.,"Good machine, but don't expect it to last for many years. The hose connecting the machine to the pick becomes brittle after a couple of years and snaps in half. I guess you get your money's worth though. You probably could replace the hose, but it's old anyway."
5,Reliable and Easy to Use,"I spent twice as much money when I bought a HydroFloss oral irrigator. That thing has a pump that would start leaking after a few months and required shipment back to the service center every year for a pump replacement. It was a waste of money. I finally wised up and bought a Waterpik.I've used my Waterpik Ultra three times a day for over three years now, and it's still trouble free.The hose is a bit short, but that's my only criticism."
1,Not happy.,"It works well but the button on the hand controller occasionally sticks and the only way to free it is to rap it sharply on a hard surface, sometimes multiple times. I understand this is a design weakness with the unit and I expect it to fail at some time. It is only a couple of weeks old and the problem started within a few days. Very disappointing!"
4,Good,It works as described on the brochure and totally serves the purpose. Only had to use one of the tool heads
4,Great product,"I would strongly consider this product. My dentist recommended it and it works great, just takes some getting use to it.."
5,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,This is the greatest appliance for dental maintenance. It's amazing how it manages to remove minuscule particles that lodge between the teeth. Flossing just isn't enough. I'm sorry I didn't purchase this long before.
4,Flosser does its job,I previously had a Waterpik rechargeable flosser which would no longer recharge after less than two years. This flosser works much better as it always has the same amount of pressure.
5,Something good,I purchase a ultra water flosser and and I am so happy I recommend to everybody that want to keep a healthy teeth floss never be so easy
2,Very good but did not last 3 years,"Worked very well but did not last. First thing that went was the little on/off button on the handle. That was after about 12-15 months. Next was the water hose from the unit to the handle. It cracked in half. Great idea, needs better plastics."
4,One star off for short cord,"I must have one of the smallest bathrooms in NYC...it does not have a sink. The only sink is in the kitchen. Now, if I was in a normal house I don't think it would be an issue, but there is only one plug that is somewhat near a water source. In the bathroom, near the tub. Event though the room is small, it doesn't reach far enough for me to be comfortable using it...so I do not use it as often as I'd like because it gets water all over the bathroom.When I use it though, it's great. It gets things out of my gums that brushing didn't do, nor do I think flossing would find. Maybe someday when I move to a new place, I will use it more diligently. I guess I'd better shop for a good extension cord in the meantime. Until then, I reserve it for when I eat something that I know will get stuck in my teeth.Since most people have normal bathrooms, I'd highly recommend."
4,Works Great TIPS are NOT color coded and not as shown.,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas so it would be easier, more effective, and more fun for them to floss. So far, they LOVE it. It has good water pressure and is easy for them to refill and swap out heads independently. Unfortunately, it did NOT come with the color coded tips as indicated and only has ONE regular tip. The other accessories are varied and surely there is something for everyone but it would have been nice if it had included what was in Amazon's picture. I am having to order additional tips."
1,very bad!!!doesn t work and didn't answer my mails!!!! I Don t recommand American RX,I receive the item dammage and no answer to my mails!I really doesn't recommand American RX.VERY BAD SELLERS!!!!!!!
4,Total Mouth Care,"I ordered this Waterpik several months ago. I liked it so much I order one for both of my sons. It's a total mouth care system with a brush attachment, a tongue cleaner, a rubber tip for tight in-be-tween teeth cleaning and a basic jet. All attachments spray a steam of water. I hate flossing and you really should still floss, but the spraying of warm water on my gums feel much better. The intensity of the water can be adjusted. It takes a little while to get use to it so you don't spray the mirror or your face, but it's well worth it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is I haven't had it long enough to see how long the unit will last."
1,Poor tube design,"Loved this waterpik during it's brief life. After less than a year, the tube that connects the base to the handle developed a hole. If I could open the handle, i could cut the hose and reattach with the hose slightly shortened. This appears impossible to do. In other words, a great waterpik becomes junk in under a year because waterpik couldn't have a used a sturdier hose. what a shame."
3,Faulty,"The product is still functional after two months of use, but the glass pick is becoming loose. Only time will tell if the Waterpik continues to operate. The design is compact and takes up little counter space. I like the way it cleans my teeth."
2,Worked great while it lasted,"I really liked this water flosser and it worked well at removing plaque and nasty stuff around teeth. However, I only used it a few times a week, took good care of it, and it broke after just a couple of months. It no longer has any sort of pressure when the water comes out. It basically dribbles out."
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,It flushes debris but does not replace dental floss. The older model I had had a larger water container. This container is a bit too small for my liking. I would not recommend it to someone looking to stop flossing with string.
3,No Power,I was expecting this Waterpik to have a more powerful water flow. It is not adequate to take care of plaque. I would not recommend this to someone
3,Great but died after a year.,This was a terrific model and the power settings and capacity were great. However the hand held control died shortly after purchase and the rest died within a year.
3,Every 15 months or so,this Waterpik quits working and I buy a new one. I use it after using an electric toothbrush. I see Walgreen's now has a model by a manufacturer that is NOT Waterpik. These flossers are good for the gums and one can get away without using flossing threads.
3,Water Flosser,"While the dentist swears by this, I am not so sure that it was worth the money. It was a good price."
4,Pretty Good.,"I bought it for my family and they loved it. However, some of the tips were useless to me."
4,Very good -- but at least one little design flaw,"I had never used a Waterpik but after a freind as well as my dentist recommended it, I tried it. I am delighted with the way it dislodges tiny food articles that I never thought could be there, even after I had brushed thoroughly. BUT, there is one thing that I consider a design flaw. There is a button on the handle that you push in order to turn off the stream of water. The problem is that there is a natural tendency to push the button to turn it on, not off. So, even though you think about what you are doing, if you accidentally let up on the button while the pik is out of your mouth, it squirts all over the place. The designers should have reversed it, so that you push the button when you want a jet of water and release it when you want it to stop. However, once you get used to this, the Waterpick works great. I have no complaints."
2,can be dangerous,"I used a waterpik on the high pressure setting, and because of the tip design, it's difficult to properly shoot the stream perpendicular to the inner sides of teeth, especially the front teeth. Within days many of my teeth became perceptibly loose, and my periodontal disease is minimal, with healthy gums. I've come to realize that my improper use of repeatedly shooting significant pressure down the gum pocket must have separated the gingival connective tissue and even irritated the periodontal ligament that holds the teeth to bone. I just hope it will reverse over time. The significant dangers of this device definitely need to be better known."
1,Marie,"The Waterpik WP-100 that I received was defective. The watertank only went down to one-half and the remaining water was not able to be used. Also, the lightest setting, for caps, braces, etc., was still too strong. I really would like to find an oral irrigator that has a very mild setting."
2,Voltage Problem,"Since I live in the country that is using 220V instead of 110V,I still cannot use this product yet.I'm quite disappointed to find out that this product is using 110V, no information of this fact in the product review.To Amazon, please specify this information for all electricity-related products in the future.thank you"
2,fatal flaw,i finally bought a new waterpic after many years of using an old model. the old one always suffered from not enough water capacity. always had to mix a separate container with water/and hydrogen peroxide and mouthwash. before i could finish a good job of cleaning i would always run out of liquid and have to refill container. well the new ultra flosser i bought is much worse about running out of liquid before i finish flossing. it also has less pressure than old one. i would have kept the old one if i had known.
5,Great product at a good price.,"My son got braces, so I got him this Waterpik. It works great, he loves it and is using it on a regular basis."
5,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water JetUnit is very-well designed and easy to use in spite of it's many attachments and settings. It exceeded my expectations based on theproduct description.
5,VERY SATISFIED,FIRST TIME OWNER OF WATERPIC AND VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT. VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY EFFECTIVE CLEANING TOOL WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
4,Great so far,"It's exactly what I expected. Great water pressure, small foot print. The chord is a little constricting sometimes, and forces me to bend down (which you have to do anyway to not make a mess), and the plastic handle feels like it could break fairly easily. The stop button at the handle just pinches the line, and anything above the first setting will still force its way out of the nozzle. Overall I'm satisfied, and amazon has the cheapest price I've seen for it."
5,waterpik ultra dental water jet,The product is everything that I expected and much more. I have been having serious gum problems and this has served be a major factor in rectifying the condition. I am very pleased with the product.
4,"Great, but messy!","I really like the 'just from the dentist' clean feeling you get when using this product, my only complaint is it is really messy!! Keep your mouth closed or water splashes everywhere! But I suppose that is the nature of the beast with this one!"
4,"Works like a charm, sounds like heavy equipment...","This Water Pik is great, I have always hated flossing and this really does the job. It works just as well as traditional flossing, but doesn't cause me any pain. It is, however, incredibly loud. I will also note that ""pausing"" the flow of water is kind of a pain. They should have reversed the function so that you push the button to release water flow, instead of holding the button to pause water flow. My finger has, on occasion, slipped from the button, spraying myself and my bathroom with water. I highly suggest you use the warmer water, as I attempted to skip this step and use water that was not warm (I was rushed for time and didn't want to wait for the tap to heat up) and it was highly unpleasant."
5,Waterpik Ultra,"WOW!!! great product. This waterpik keeps all the plaque off. I use it twice a day or more.I am very pickey about clean teeth,,,,It sure does the job. Now I don't need to have my teeth clean THREE time a year. Quite a cost savings."
2,a 'squirtgun',too many bells $ whistles . . . and less pressure than earlier models. Not worth the price ov over $50
5,Works great!,"I had a perfect dental exam after using the Waterpik daily for a month. I never had such a good checkup in my life and my dentist was impressed by the improvement in my dental hygeine. One warning - do NOT get the cordless model. Although convenient without the cord, they don't last long. I had two of them break down before I switched to this model."
4,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works well,"I've had this product for a number of months and it continues to work well. When set on ""10"" the water stream is very effective. It's surprising how much remains between the teeth after a thorough brushing: flossing makes a big difference and except for really hard-to-dislodge particles that may be stubbornly wedged between the teeth, this Waterpik does a very good job. The real test, of course, will be how well this product is still working 2-3 years from now."
3,It's okay...,"but then I don't really have anything to compare it to! Seems to be a little weak with the water stream, and a little tempermental. However, my gums have improved!"
4,Great Product!,"My dentist recommended a water flosser and I am glad that I chose this one. It comes with lots of tips and is easy to use. It doesn't take up too much counter space. And it works great! It cleans my teeth better than floss! I love it! It feels so good, too."
4,Works well,I like this one. I had another one that was much bigger and bulker and stopped pumping after only 6 months so I hope this one last longer. It is a good size for my very small bathroom and it works very well so far. Well designed.
4,"So far, so good","I think I really like this. I'm making a mess using this thing, but it think it's working as it should. I wish the cord didn't get wet with each use and was longer or straighter bc what comes out of my mouth tends to go back down the cord!"
2,turn up the water pressure,"compared to the old Waterpik I replaced, this model barely has enough water pressure to get the job done."
4,Does the task,Waterpik was recommended by hygenist. I have a problem with plaque and she felt that flossing and brushing were not enough.Additional food particles are washed away after the normal floss and brush routine so I know it is doing a good job.I found the water tank to be a bit too small and it seems to vibrate on the higher settings.
5,Pretty cool device,"When I started using it about two months ago with middle power (5 of 10), my gums were bleeding a lot (my dental had said that it's OK). One week later they stopped bleeding at all and I increased power to the max (10 of 10). Now I feel that my gums are more stronger and healthy. The jet power is good enough to clean everything between teeth.Cons: water tank is too small. I use one for upper teeth then refill it for lower teeth."
2,Could be better,Bought this product even though some of the reviews were not that great and I can see why. When using this product if the water well is not securely on (sometimes you need to hold it down) it will not work. For the price I thought this product should work properly. I would not recommend this product it is not worth the money.
4,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,"I purchased this as a replacement for a Waterpik that finally died after some years. Over all I have no complaints It works well, and does what is supposed to ( you don't see that to often anymore).There is of course almost always a but....and this is mine.The Waterpik attachment clicks into a rotating head. This allows you to reposition the angle as needed while in use. I feel that the detents (click stops)are to loose and should be more firm.All together I think it is an excellent product."
3,Flossing still required!,"Don't believe the hype. Flossing is still required. It does help with getting out food under the gum line, but you still need to floss between your teeth. When you use the Waterpik for the first time your gums will bleed, but after a few days you get accustomed to the pressure. The only other thing I dislike is the horrible noise of the pump. I would have gladly paid twice the cost for something that doesn't sound like a beat up dodge. All in all, this is a nice additional tool in your arsenal of oral hygiene."
4,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,I have been using this for a month once a day and this device works great. The tongue cleaner came with is useless and it does not work. I am rating this product 4 star only for useless tongue cleaner and I do not know the durability of it at this time.
4,I expected more water pressure,"The water pressure is lower than I expected. However, it is adequate if you use the narrow, pointed nozzle. Other than that, it's well constructed, and mine hasn't leaked as others have reported."
5,Excellent!,This is my first purchase of a Waterpik. My Hygeinest suggested that I get one for my gum problems. It took a while to get used to. I had water all over the place. I have no prblems with this product at all. It does a excellent job on my gums. I am surprised to see how much is left to clean after you brush your teeth.
5,Great waterpik,Thank you I have been looking for a waterpik for months now. I bought one from walmart but returned it bacause it was a lot of money and cordless it didn't work the well. I was very happy to get the old fashion waterpik with some power.
2,Missing Part,"In the description it states this product comes with a tongue cleaner, but the tongue cleaner was missing. Shipping was prompt and everything else is fine."
5,Own two,"We have one that I have used for years. My husband finally asked me for one of his own, so I got him another one for Christmas. We both use them every day and they really do the job of getting out the bacteria and other stuff you don't want in your mouth attacking your teeth."
3,Waterpik,"I've owned several of these throughout the years and always loved them. This particular one, however, seemed a bit more difficult to use and I finally realized the cord leading to the toothbrush is not lined up correctly. Had I noticed this right away, I would have returned it requesting another one."
4,"Works well, but....","The Flossser works as well as expected. It has all the accessories required. Since the tips are rather delicate , packaging is important. Some small flaws: it could have shipped with color coded tips so that more than one person could easily use it. Or may be , a complete second set of tips as an option. Also, in international shipping, a 220 V model would have been more useful. This was not evident from its description.Overall, a good product."
1,Avoid at All Costs,"If you want a better return on your investment, try flushing your money down the toilet or setting it on fire. I would award this zero stars if I could. The device jams up nearly every night. Essentially, no water comes out, and no amount of toying, coaxing, or wiggling will get it to work. Many nights, after 10 minutes of trying, I just give up on seeking healthy gums. I could get better results with an ice pick."
4,better than dental floss,"Our dental hygienist's recommendation narrowed the search to this brand. It was difficult selecting a model, though, because there were so many to choose from on amazon and on Waterpik's site.The flosser works well, but even if the intensity is only on the #4 setting, the water reservoir empties out too fast. Using a higher intensity setting requires adding more water once or twice. A larger tank would be helpful. When we're finished flossing we turn the reservoir upside down to dry out but there's nothing to cover the base unit. The tank cover would be a reasonable thing to put over the unit, but it's not shaped to fit. The base, the upside-down tank, and the cover take up a lot of counter space.We found nothing in the instructions about how to clean anything before first use."
4,Good Product,I bought this item to replace my broken flosser. It works just fine...better than the other company's product. Would purchase again.
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosseer,It's marvelous and great to use teeth. Most dental recommend to have that for your teeth care. I'm very happy to be useful.
2,waterpick,"Be sure the reservoir is TIGHTLY placed on the base - any wiggle room just causes the pic to not put our the stream of water necessary to use. Other than that, it seems to be working as described."
5,Ultra Powerful!!,"I have been having issues with food getting into the crevices of each tooth. A friend suggested a water pik, as the floss wasn't doing the job...this water pik is the best ever!!!! I have used others, water runs all over. This gadget gets the job done. I highly recommend to anyone. It relieved my tooth pain!!"
4,More For The Money Than I Thought,"Product was received in excellent condition and on time. Product is more than I expected, with all the different attachments. Very pleased."
4,Works as described,"It works, does what it's supposed to do. Works better than flossing to get out crap from inbetween your teeth. I deducted 1 star because the cord is too short for me to use it in the shower."
5,Dental health,"Rapid delivery and a great price for a super product. the flosser is easy to use, easy to maintain, and does a great job."
2,Not a good purchase,We purchased two of these about 1.5 years ago. One unit failed within 6 months. The other is still working but not very well. You have to turn it on and off several times to get the water to flow. It works for my husband but I have to then bang it on the counter to get it to work. We empty it every use but it still grows mildew under the top cover and under the well. We just received the new Phillips Airflosser - hopefully it will be better. I wouldn't recommend the Waterpik unit.
1,poor customer service+warranty,"I bought the unit(Waterpik ultra flosser) in June of 2009 from Amazon.com. In Jan. 2011, less than 2 years later, the unit developed leaking problem and intermittent motor operation problem.When I contacted Waterpik, the calls either kept on getting dropped or I keep on getting passed to Waterpik sales place.I thought the warranty was 2 years, but apparently, they want to save money by not honoring the warranty.Don't waste your money on this company's product."
2,Does not last long...,"I purchased this Waterpik in June '07 and a couple of months later the handle malfunctioned inside so it would leak all the water and therefore it had no cleaning pressure. I contacted the manufacturer and after a couple of weeks they sent me a replacement handle. That worked well up until now (a year later). The handle broke again on the inside where it fits the attachment and can no longer hold it - a small spring came off along with a small plastic part that broke. Anyway, this model is a good concept but must be made of cheap materials so don't expect yours to last too long, look for better options."
1,This is a terrible product.,We made the mistake of buying 2. Both leaked at about 3 months. I ordered a replacment hose a month ago. It never came. Called again and was on hold for 2 hours. Wrote letter. No response. You will be wasting your money if you buy this one.
3,Waterpik Ultra 100 Waterjet,"Expected more from the product as my current Waterpik is at least 20 years old. Thought I'd be getting quite an upgrade after 20 years and $50. Not so. If you still have a working model, stick with it & save your money. My only complaint with my old model was a slight leak between the tip and the hose. The water compartment of the new unit does not have the same capacity (smaller!) and while it seemed neat at first to have the tips stored under the lid, I now worry about it being a breeding ground for germs and mold. At least with the old unit the tips stood outside and the water drained away."
5,Model 100 Waterpik,"This replaced an older model. The 100 has a better design and useful features.It is lighter, more compact, easier to handle, and quieter.It has more comfortable wand with a pause button. The tips are easier to change by pressing an eject button rather than pushing and twisting. The hose retains it's shape and does not kink. The Pik Pocket tip delivers RX under gum flaps. Do I sound pleased? I am."
1,"First died in a week, second is going strong.","Worked like a champ for a week. Then (after I had tossed away the packaging and other paperwork) it just up and died on me mid-floss. It's 46$ - so it's not worth calling customer support or amazon. I'll just have to chalk this one up to poor quality control and bad luck on my part I suppose.Update - I did not want to give up on this, so I bought another. This time I kept the packaging safely. And of course - it has been working like a champ for the last 3 months. While having one die within the first week is rather irksome - I'm going to upgrade the rating to a 4 star because it's just so handy and effective at getting those annoying little bits out."
1,"Not durable, dead within 2 months light use","I just use it no more than two minutes every day and usually at scale 5-8. I thought I could use it at least half year when I first got it but just go failure days ago.Not good quality. The body is made of cheap plastic.The design is not bad and it is convenient to use. I will give it five stars if it could last one year.By the way, I am still contact waterpik Inc. about the warranty issue."
5,waterpik,Product cleans teeth very good. It is easy to use and does not create a mess. Can be used with mouthwash. Highly recommend for dental care.
5,BETTER THAN FLOSSING,Yes floss is inexpensive but man is it a pain in the butt. I've had this waterpik for over 2 months now and use it more frequently than I did floss. It was such an mundane task but not anymore. Hopefully my dentist notices the difference!
5,Very pleased with Ultra Water Flosser,"I have been using this product for about a month and it has performed well. I like the compact size and the fact that it is easy to use and clean up. The splashing is annoying, but as I get more practice and experience using it, I am learning to limit the splashing. Over all, I am well pleased"
4,"Good system for braces, but be careful of pause button!","I purchased this for my son since he had braces and it is wonderful! It gets all the food stuck between his brackets and eliminates the threader floss, which is hard to use. It comes with various tips and is a must for those with orthodontic appliances. I would have given it 5 stars, except the first one I got had problems. The pause button would get stuck and water would not come out. However, it was replaced at no charge and the second one is working fine. Additionally, be sure the canister holding the water is on tight, as well as the tips snap into place. It takes a little getting used to in the beginning without water spraying everywhere, but one gets used to it pretty fast. Extra tips allow for more than one user. It was recommended by his orthodonist, in addition to flossing, but I think this can replace it. I, the mom even use it instead of regular floss daily! Would recommend it, but just be careful about the pause button."
4,Good product.,"This Waterpik is so much improved from my old, rectangular one (about 8 years old???). It is much sleeker and nicer looking to keep on the counter (if you are so inclined). It is a bit taller than my old one, which is fine. I think it is better designed with the storage of extra piks and brushes in the lid compartment. The only thing that I'd redesign on this item IS the lid. It tends to fall into the reservoir when you lift it to access the other piks. I think that a snap type hinge would work well to hold it in place, as well as making it easy to remove for cleaning. I also like the recessed area for the hose. Very nice product. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a dental water jet."
5,Waterpick,I purchased this waterpick after the one I had finally gave out. This one is much quiter and the design is more streamlined than the older version. I do like it & it gets the job done. I would recommend this product for the family to keep your dental bills down.
4,Very compact,"I bought this to replace my old one. The design on this model is quite an improvement. The reservoir is more ergonamic.. the coil on the pick retains it's shape and returns to it's place very easily...smaller footprint. I don't gerneally use the cover, because I turn it the reservoir upside-down to air dry, but it is a handy place for the accessories. I would have given this item 5-stars had it not been for the pause button sticking. After about a month of use, whenever it's pressed I cannot unpause it without turning the whole thing off"
3,Was great while it lasted...,"We got this WaterPik about 10 months ago and I started using it about 3 or 4 days a week. When I went for a dental cleaning 4 months after I started using it, ny hygienist and dentist both said there was a huge improvement in the condition of my gums and mouth in general. SO, I happily continued using it at about the same frequency until 3 weeks ago, when it just stopped working. who knows why, but I am extremely frustrated that it didn't even last a year - in fact, it barely made it to 10 months! I know it wasn't horribly expensive, but I am tired of this ""throwaway"" state we seem to be in where appliances are produced with a very short term of built-in obsolescence."
5,Water Pik,"My dentist recommended I use a waterpik. This model works very good, the various speeds allow you to start out using lower speeds and gradually increase as your gums start to heal. This model is easy to use and fill. The assortment of tips is very good and you can store them in the top of the unit. Also has a great 3 year warranty."
5,it all works,"very pleased with this product. It has the power and flexibility to do a good job, and it's footprint is compact and well designed. Hopefully it will hold up to everyday use. It was highly recommended by my dentist for people with bridges and furcations, and I can see why now that I'm using it."
3,Waterpik Ultra Review,"This product does everything the information mentions; however, it fails to mention how messy it gets when using it. The force of the water shooting out and hitting your teeth makes the water go everywhere."
4,New style waterpik big hit,"This new Waterpik is a lovely, modern design and comes with all kinds of piks, for gums, tongue, gum pockets, etc. I am delighted with the very fast delivery from the seller.The only criticism is that the tank holding the water is much smaller than the old type, so that it seems the water goes down very quickly and unless you refill the tank, you get a shorter period of high powered stream."
4,My Pick of waterpik,"Product is high quality for sure. although the top is a little flimsy considering you must remove and replace the top every time you use it. And I think the water pressure could be a little higher for deeper cleaning. Aside from those 2 points, I would recommend this product for good oral hygiene."
5,Great Flosser,"I got this home and was so happy because now I could do away with the string floss. This cuts time and does a great job. I actually enjoy just shooting water on and between my teeth over maneuvering a piece of string in my mouth. Things might be a little messy while getting used to it, but it's well worth it. You will get used to it very quickly. It can go from very gentle to blasting. I stay between the two. As far as how loud it is, well, it's not that loud. I mean there are definitely other things more annoying. I just think its a great product and will replace mine if it ever needs it. I recommend getting it."
1,Save your money and the landfill...,My husband and I really enjoyed the ultra water pik for about one month before it started leaking and became unusable. We've had the same problem with other counter top irrigators and got tired of buying and disposing of them so we switched to a redipik which simply attaches/detatches to and from bathroom faucet easily and takes up no counter space. Problem solved quickly and inexpensively and it's more convenient since you have more control over the flow and can use it as long as you want to - no tank to refill.
2,Do not buy,"I bought this water flosser hoping it would help clean my teeth better. Well, first it is no comparison to a professional water flosser the dentists use in their offices. Second it broke down on me the second time I used it. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy. I was able to return it for a full refund. Definitely will not buy this again."
5,Very Pleased =),I'm very happy I bought this item. I love the water pressure settings & it holds more water than my last Waterpik. This makes flossing so much easier and is more effective. I agree that the water hose could be longer yet it coils right back into the holder and looks tidy. It came with so many attachment heads I haven't tried yet. Well worth the price.
4,Orthodontist Approved Clean,"I just got back from a late afternoon orthodontic appointment. The Dr. said, ""Wow! Your teeth are really clean! Cleanest I've seen all day."" She THANKED me for doing such a thorough job of cleaning my teeth and braces. I thank Waterpik. Flossing around braces got old in a hurry. Using a proxabrush isn't much better. The Waterpik is much faster, easier, more comfortable - and apparently very effective.My only complaint about this product is that the PikPocket tips don't last very long. The rubber tip splits, rendering it useless. Order several replacements when you order your machine, because they are not available in any stores, as far as I can tell."
2,Waterpik Handle Not Durable,"The handle is awkward and the coiled plastic hose does not safely extend far from the unit forcing one to place the unit at the lip of the sink. The on/off button on the handle frequently sticks in the off position. It is easy to inadvertently push the tip release button. The tip locking mechanism breaks easily. I have owned the unit for only 3 months and the tip locking mechanism is already broken. If one purchases this unit I highly recommend you save the receipt for warranty claim as early handle replacement seems to be quite common. In summary the handle is just not durable enough.On the plus side when the unit is working, it does a very nice job of flushing out food particles missed during brushing and flossing."
5,Good Product,"Its been 9 months since I brought it and it still works great.Kids love using it / cleans out the braces very well.If more then two people will be using it ,I recommend purchasing additional water pik jets at the time of purchase, because you cant find a store that has these things in inventory"
2,"Its ok, but doesn't replace flossing.","It doesn't replace flossing as I had hoped it would. I've had it for a few months now and have flossed right after use, and food residue is still present."
3,OK product,"Waterpik is good at clearing random bits of food from your gums. Use warm water, not cold water or it is unpleasant. There is an attachment that shoots a very narrow stream which works well for this purpose."
2,OK except it blows the GFCI Circuit Breaker,Waterpik seems to do its job except it trips my GFCI circuit breaker every time the unit is turned off. No other devices that use this GFCI cause the breaker to trip so it must be a defective Waterpik. Not impressed.
2,"brand new, but does not work at all","I got this as Christmas gift. Just spent an hour trying to figure out how to use the thing. I hear the motor buzzing, but there is absolutely no water flow. Guess it's just a defective unit. I have heard people recommending waterpik, but I think they are too cheap and unreliable.Update - it turns out the valve on the bottom of the tank was upside down. It came like that. Unacceptable Q/C."
2,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,It is a fine cleaner and massager at the gum line but I still feel I need to floss between my teeth.
2,Gargle instead....and save your money...,"I used to love my Waterpick but after a couple of years it died. As a satisfied customer, I ordered 3 more for my sons and one for me. What a disappointment.The machine goes from #2 to #9 or 10, I don't remember but it doesnt matter because the only speed that makes sense and that barely would clean your teeth is the highest one, the 9 or 10. My question to the manufacturer. Why bother with numbering the speeds when you know very well that the highest is the only speed that would barely clean the debris between your teeth.Sometime next week I must return two. I asked my son not to bother to open it and I am returning mine. What a disappointment....I used to love my old Waterpik, unfortunately the manufacturer is cutting corners and they have lost this faithful customer.Azulic"
3,ok,it came with every thing but they tell me that know i will have to replace the heads ever 3-6 months and it does get water every were but oh well but it is loud but it is good for what is is for
4,H2O floss,"The product does just what it was supposed to do and has worked without a hitch. My only criticism concerns the accessories -- tongue cleaner, etc. They just get in the way, and I disposed of them within two weeks of starting to use the unit. I would have gladly traded them for an extra pick."
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"I expected this product to eliminate the need to floss with string, but according to my dental hygienist,that is not the case. So based on this, the product is not meeting my intended need. Otherwise, it is fine."
2,Deficient Capacity,"The WP-100 water reservoir is too absurdly small! Switching the Waterpik off when you're just partially done, removing the tank to refill it, then reassembling the unit -- all this before you can get back to the job -- is tiresome and ANNOYING. That said, this latest model is (1 star) more functional and (2nd star) more attractive than any of Waterpik's earlier fine products."
1,Waterpik Blues,This is my very first waterpik and either I got a lemon or the product is really BAD!! Water drips out of every nook and cranny once it passes into the handle and so the water container empties out immediately. This Ultra Dental Water Jet is an Ultra Mega Disappointment. Got it today and it's a gonner tomorrow.
2,Disappointed,"I had previously owned a Water Pik, but I was extremely disappointed with this model which is one of their better if not their top-of-the-line model. The motor which drives the water pressure to remove the plaque is significantly less powerful than my previous model. Setting the water pressure on 10 (maximum pressure) on this model is comparable to setting it on 5 or 6 on my previous one. I have serious reservations about the new model's ability to effectively remove plaque since the water stream is so weak. My previous model more closely emulated the water stream pressure one would experience at the dentist's office. Also, if you have a pedestal sink such as I, keep in mind that this model is big & bulky and will take up quite a bit of room on top of the sink. In fact, depending on the size of your pedestal sink, you may not even be able to place it on the sink unless there's sufficient flat surface to support it."
5,Excellent!!,"Great product! Amazing the junk that your toothbrush leaves behind and this thing cleans out. We bought this as a replacement for thier rechargeable version. Much better, much more powerful. Highly recommended!"
3,Not built like it used to.,"This is my second Waterpik Ultra, and ""planned obsolescence"" is doing its job. This thing is not like the first one I bought about 5 years ago. First thing that disappointed me is the water pressure. When I set it to the highest level, 10, it only feels like 5 in my old one when it was brand new. I guess it has a weaker motor. The over all build quality has gotten worse. The switch feels weak, it doesn't snap on and off like the older one. The water picks up a bad plastic taste. Perhaps this product is being made with cheaper quality plastics. I hope I don't get sick from a product that is supposed to keep my mouth healthy. I will say one good thing about it. It still does its job."
1,They just don't make things like they used to,"The seal in the water reservoir leaked a lot, right from the start. We called the 800 number and they sent us a new seal, this one leaked too. So we are returning it."
3,Great product for folks with crowns,Update 1/17/2013:I am removing 2 stars (from 5 star to 3 Star) as though product is good with cleaning - the bottom part (handle) broke within a year and I had to order Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit to get this working again.=========================================================================================================Old Feedback:This is an excellent product and best way to clean your teeth. I have quite a few Crowns as I did not take care of my teeth when I was younger but now I used this every day and it takes out small items stuck between the crown. make sure you set the speed accordingly as if you set too high (like. aboe 5 or 6) then your Crown may come out because of the high water force. I also used normal flossing together with this waterpik and it removes all of the small items. Really great product and I would highly recommend.
5,Waterpik for healthy gums and teeth,"I recently had a 4 tooth bridge put in my lower left moler forward and was given these fishing line loops with a tail(Best way to describe them)that you put floss through the loop and push it under the bridge to protect from food under there. this is a real task for an old guy! I did it about twice in 5 days, because I could not get this thing through the back of my mouth. I went to the store to purchase a waterpik and found the price to be about $100.00. I cam home and went to Amazon on my computer and found the same item for half the price and it works great for many more things then just getting food out from under the bridge. i couldn't be more pleased. I love the device and can highly suggest you get one no matter how your teeth are."
4,Good Product,Purchased this as a recommendation from my dentist. Works really well to clean between teeth and gums. This product will still remove things from your teeth even after you have brushed. This in combination with a sonicare brush get your teeth and gums very clean.
4,Doing its job,I bought this unit needing to clear any food matter remaining between my teeth after brushing and the unit is doing just that. The only thing that I believe is negative is the plastic cable that the pique is attached to as it can acquire a slit and cannot be replaced causing one to have to purchase a new unit which would be much more expnsive than replacing the cable.
5,Waterpik WP-100 review,"Have been using it for a couple weeks already.No complains. Easy to use.Feels much better than flossing, and it takes less time."
5,waterpik excellent,"I have used waterpiks, ever since I had braces many years ago and have always thought their products were excellent. They have only gotten better over the years. I would recommend this product very high."
4,Clean Teeth,This product was recommended by my dentist. I am more than pleased with the results. It is easy to use and makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed. Its compact design fits easily on my small bathroom vanity.
1,Poor replacement for original WaterPik,Completely unhappy. Description did not tell me which tips I would get. Only one is the type I use. My wife has no tip to use. We have used a WaterPik for over 30 years. Will warn my friends about buying one.
3,Not Very Good,I though that this item would be an alternative to floss but based on my few of using it I could say that I am disappointed.
1,Don't Believe It,"I bought this unit and it may indeed work sometimes, BUT:a) from day one it leaked water and destroyed our wood counter top.b) in fairly short order it failed in so much as it didn't pass the water through. Sometimes it finally worked and sometimes it didn't. But increasingly it didn't.Lousy product design and/or execution.Tonight I threw the damned thing in the garbage.Hopefully someone makes something that works!PS: I have a Panasonic unit for travel. Infinitely better made, but its pressure is nominal at best."
2,Okay but messy,"Bought one of these a couple of weeks ago, it works fine and seems like it's reasonably well made but when you use it the water goes everywhere, also you have to stop and refill it.I imagine I'll just throw mine away because I can't see using it very often, hard to keep the bathroom sink neat if you are spraying water all over the place on a regular basis.Also the power seemed weak to me, I turned it up to 10 the first time I used it and to me it doesn't seem strong enough to be of much use."
4,Works well for my husband and I,"I purchased this with my husband in mind, as he has a lot of cavities that are in the process of being filled. He really loves it for flushing them out gently until all his dental procedures are complete.I myself have been using this twice a day. I feel that only the highest level really does much. I think the lower settings are more suited for irrigating large pieces of food out. Just be careful when starting out on setting ten! My gums bled the first use."
1,doesn't work,"After using the cordless travel waterpik for years, I thought I would try the plug in kind. That was a mistake. After the first few uses, it stopped working. I turn it on and hear the unit whirring, but no water comes out. I was going to return it but had such faith in the product, I didn't keep the box. I ordered 3 more cordless waterpiks and although charging them is a pain, at least they work and the spray is powerful. Now, if they could just make a purse-size cordless so I can carry it everywhere."
2,Flossing should not be this big of a struggle,"Bought this flosser upon recommendation by my dentist. On receiving the package noticed that a tip was broken. I used it for a week found it to be more of a hassle (and mess) than anything else. The conventional dental floss works the best, floss pick comes next, everything else comes next and then I would rank waterpik."
2,Stopped working after 6 months of moderate use...,"I'm not sure what happened here, but while it was great for the 6 months it worked... I just can't give this more than 2 stars given how long it lasted. I might try getting another one, gambling that I just had bad luck (since it seems the manufacturer support in these instances is a complete waste of time), but not sure yet. I'm glad I didn't buy a long term supply of replacement pick heads, that's for sure. I read the instructions and it claims there is ""no maintenance required"" (which I found a bit odd and too good to be true), so I don't know what could be going on. Now when I turn it on it just sits- no sounds, nothing."
5,waterpic flosser,I am very pleased with this purchase. It cleans better than any floss or brush-pic ever could. I was surprised at the value you get for your money.
4,pretty good,"good,lots of options on pipette and speed (strength), can't think of anything more.bad side,the cap is not well designed. often have hard time to put it back to position (it should be instantaneously and straight forward). also you can put all the pipettes in the top cap but fits loosely and easy to move off position."
3,Water pik,"I am disappointed in the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, the wire that holds the cleaning device split, no way it can be fixed. It lasted me a month shy of two years. I certainly thought I would get more use out of it then that.John Joyce"
4,waterpik review,"This is an excellent product in form and function. I consider it to be the best on the market at this time. This is my fourth or fifth Waterpik. All the prior models lasted only a couple of years before the hoses would break at the base of the handles. The pluses for this newer model are a water tank lid that stores the extra nozzle tips, the unit is a little quieter, and the controls are more convenient than its predecessor. However it lacks the water pressure of its predecessor (disappointing) and it's designed for one person only - lacking additional nozzle tips for your mate. It's a little pricy at your retail store but you can save 22% plus tax if purchased on the internet (Amazon) which makes it an excellent buy."
5,Very Pleased,The product works great. It is used to clean around braces and the gum line. It is used once a day.
4,good cleaner worth the money,"we bought this because I am too lazy to floss. I feel this is fairly good replacement for flossing.very convenient, easy to use.. less cumbersome than flossing.would recommend it."
3,WaterPik Ultra Water Flosser,"This is my first WaterPik and I'm disappointed in that the water coming through the piks is not forceful enough to give the gums a really good massage while cleaning. The water piks seem too fragile. The water cord is too short and does not allow for one to stand up while cleaning. One must bend over the sink and this becomes an uncomfortable position before one finishes. That said, I will continue nightly use of the WaterPik as part of my dental hygiene as well as my Sonicare electric toothbrush."
2,"Water, water everywhere . . . you're gonna get wet.","Sturdy, well designed, great concept, but very messy. Water squirts out from connections or runs down your arm when using. Left unit filled with water on counter with jet spray unit not engaged in the holder but laying on countertop. By the time I returned to it sometime later, the water had leaked completely out of the unit."
1,Could be Much Better,"I gave it one star because there wasn't anything lower. Directions indicate that beginners should keep it at the lowest point in pressure at first. I did and the water dripped out. Cranking it up a notch did nothing but empty out the water container quickly (maybe 20-25 seconds) although I'd filled it to capacity. There is a steady stream from the pik, the handle and the around the area where the pik attaches. It was a mess. Could be that I got a lemon, nevertheless, it's definitely going back. Oh,one good thing about this item is that it seemed quiet enough during the few seconds it was on."
2,Vibrates and it is VERY LOUD,"Is this supposed to be this loud? I have a portable panasonic water jet that requires batteries, but that is so quiet. I thought there was something wrong with it at first, but Waterpik support says it is ""normal"". Not happy."
2,Lacks the power the product used to have.,this new water pik is not has powerful as my last one. Water Pik admits changing the product. It is not as effective as it once was.
2,I am surprised,I am really surprised how awkward this product was. Why the high reviews beats me. When I first tried it there was water all over the place. It was pretty awkward all around. I hope it works better for you than it did for me.
4,Waterpik ultra,"I bought the ultra because I couldn't find water jets for my old model. I have been using waterpik's for 30 years and have owned several models. Although, this model is compact and has lots of jet options it does not have the force of my other models. It seems to do the job and I like the small profile even thought it does not hold as much water as my other models. All in all I give it 4 stars."
4,Item arrived on time in good condition.,It works very well. I wish it has a spare regular tip for an extra user rather than all the other special tips
5,Love my Waterpik,"I have been using my Waterpik for 1 month now. Very good price at Amazon. I'm a first time user and have been wanting to try it for a few years and has been recommended by my Dentist. . I went with the Ultra. I read where some people have trouble with water spraying all over the place, well they just don't know how to use it. With a little practice there is not a problem. I use the Gum fitting, and it works great as far as I'm concerned. The particles of food come flowing out with ease. My only problem is my Bathroom sink, I have no place to set the Waterpik down on a flat area, so I have to hold it on one spot of sink with one hand as I use the other to use the pik. Works for me and have no other choice at this time. Next month is my Dentist appointment and I'm curious to see if they notice a differents. So, you can say I'm VERY happy with my Waterpik Ultra."
5,Small yet powerful,"I use the waterpik daily it work's great and fits in a small area on my bathroom sink,I usually keep it set on 3 and that seems more than powerful enough for me.It comes with plenty of attachments and the pik pock tip isgreat to use for deep cleaning"
4,The WaterPik WP-100...,"Pros: I found the WP-100 to be a good value for the price. It's easy to use with plenty of power, [I haven't used the high setting yet]. This kit provides an easy way for cleaning between teeth and the tooth & gum. A plus is the kit comes with a variety of jets.Con: As others have noted; the plastic hose could be longer. The user has to stay fairly close to the unit so as not to strain the line.Also the jets are stored in the tank top which is isn't attached to the tank. I would've preferred a hinged top and a jet holder on the side of the unit. I consider both of these issues to be minor.Usage: I use the water jet 4-5x a week and my gums rarely bleed if ever as they did before. I add a little hydrogen-peroxide to warm water and rinse out any bacteria below the gum line, [caution note: this solution is never to be swallowed].HTH"
4,A better product,"This Ultra Dental water jet has better features than the original Water Pik. I was happy with the original until I broke the end pulling it out of the holder. There's no replacement for it. This model comes with 3 ends, has an eject button so you don't have to struggle it out, is quieter, has replacements if needed. And the power dial is on the body and not on the part where your fingers rest so you don't inadvertently change the water strength. There seems to be 1 of 3 reviews of the original where the motor stops working. I hope that isn't the case with this model. I've had it a month, so far, so good. A good water pik."
3,WATERPIK WaterPik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet,"It seems a little messy as water runs from the hose down your arms. My biggest complaint tho, is that the on /off switch need to be on the handle, not on the side of the appliance. The tank isn't very large, sometimes have to fill it twice but it does do an excellent job of cleaning my bridge,which is why I got it in the first place. It cleans out stuff that even the needle like appliance with floss the dentist gave me doesn't touch."
5,If only.....,"I've always had trouble flossing and, as a result, I have steadily lost teeth over the years. I was surfing the internet about dental implants and found two dentists that said not to even bother flossing but use a Waterpik water flosser instead. I bought one and love it. There is a small learning curve for the flosser since the first time I used it was like taking a shower. Now I bend over, rest my wrist on the sink edge and use the flosser with my lips only part way open and there is virtually no mess. Flossing is more important than brushing so if you have trouble flossing, either get one of these or lose your teeth. (Voice of experience.)"
3,Pretty Good Irrigator,"We used the older Oral-B version of oral irrigator for many years -- the one that combined with an electric toothbrush. That is no longer available, as we found when we finally needed to replace it.This one is good and much prettier, but it requires a separate toothbrush appliance. It's pulses don't seem as strong. Also you have to be careful to press the tank down to prevent leaking.With those picky negatives, it still does its main job quite well. After checking the market, this one seems to best current available. I use it daily and am satisfied."
3,My first Waterpik ... meh,"PRO:* Flushes out the gum line pretty well.* ""Pause"" button is nice.CON:* Noisy.* Messy (splatter and misty overspray is inevitable)* Controls are bit awkward (recessed power dial, and a toggle switch design that requires you grip the entire unit, instead of a toggle where you could grip just the switch itself).* Top is a smooth plastic accessories-container that doesn't say clipped shut, and it's pretty easy to drop into the reservoir. Haven't found a need for more than one of the tips, and the top won't hold all of them ... so, I'd prefer to store the tips elsewhere, and have a simpler top.* Using add-in (mouthwash) means using a *lot* since it gets diluted in the water reservoir."
4,Waterpik,Came in a timely manner and works perfectly. It was much cheaper than other places that l checked
5,Perfect for my teeth and gums,"Pick holds plenty of water to cover all of your gums inside teeth and outside.You can add your favorite mouthwas to the water. I am using Listerine and I rinse it out when I am done.the level of pick water pressure can be adjusted from 1-10. When you use it for the first time it does not seem like the pressure is much but like using dental floss you will notice it if you use to much pressure the first time.Cons, the cord just does not seem long enough and I am kind of tall so I have to bend way over to be over the sink and have enough cord.I have accidently hit the button that releases the pick because it is located at the same place you use to turn the pick to the angle you need it."
3,"Pretty cool, could have a longer hose","This is a pretty good product, though it could use a longer hose. Definitely has lots of power to clean.I'd love if there was an optional suction, but you just let the water run into the sink.I think that it's frowned upon, but I may try mixing a little mouthwash in with the water... there goes my warranty."
4,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,"I found this model of Waterpik, while attractive in style, lacked the power of my previous one, despite having a multitude of power adjustments. However it does do the job.Therefore I rate it 4 out of a possible 5."
4,Way better than Interplak any 'ol day!,So far so good on this unit. Got this to replace an Interplak that died after six months. I find the power far superior to the Interplak and the very generous solution tank is a refreshing change. I recommend you consider this unit if you want to replace what you are using now!
5,waterpik ultra is great!,"This waterpik is great--you can get your teeth/gums really clean with this, I still brush and floss too, but if I could only do one it would be the waterpik. I add a little mouthwash to the water and it really makes your mouth feel fresh. good for the gums too! the only thing i would change is where the extra attachments are stored, its a little awkward having them in the compartment on the lid."
4,"Great product, too bad it's not portable","I bought this waterpik after my last one bit the dust after less than a year of service. The rechargeable battery just got weaker and weaker, which seems to be a problem with waterpik portables. I read all the reviews and this one got the highest marks. It's not portable, but I need a waterpik that I can use daily and this one has the power for daily use. The portable model didn't hold as much water as this model. I used to have to refill the portable, I only need to fill this one once for each cleaning. Since I've been using a waterpik on my dental hygienist's recommendation, I've had less plague buildup, less time having her chip away at my teeth. I used to have to have my teeth cleaned by the hygienist every 3 months, now it's every 6 months. I'm saving money and my teeth are in better shape."
4,Wateer Pik Ultra Flosser,Like every thing about it except the hose is a bit too short unless the device is moved right to the edge of the sink.
4,Christmas gift,"This was a gift for a close friend, but I haven't heard yet how it was received. I'll report again after I hear something."
5,waterpik ultra water flosser,"Wish I had bought this years ago,After brushing the required 2 minutes, with sonicare easy clean, which I love. The waterpik gets more food between teeth.nd, so easy to use. Love it."
4,"Nice, but the Compare Chart is wrong","Seems good so far but I had to take off 1 star because the compare chart given is incorrect - it says it comes with 2 jet tips for the Ultra, but it actually only comes with one. So if you need more than one, be sure to order extra tips when you get it!"
3,Ease of handling not tested enough,"I was about to contact someone at the company:For many years I had one of their Waterpiks, very simple design and easy to use.It finally quit and I bought another brand, which was available on island. It was also satisfactory, but recently its motor slowed down from old age...Because nobody fixes anything anymore, I thought I'd get back to Waterpik, by now available via Amazon.What disturbs me is the on-off switch.Firstly it should be installed UP & DOWN , NOT side-wise, and much more easily switched without so much pressure.Has anyone at their firm tried to hold the extended pic in one hand, with the off-button held in, either over the basin or in the mouth, and then tried pushing that rocker-switch without moving the whole light-weight instrument from where it sits on the counter??? Fancy looks are not the most important:BAUHAUS: Form follows Function."
4,Waterpik Ultra,"Amazon price was excellent compared with in-store prices. Assembly was easy, but on-off switch didn't operate. Apparently it was not seated properly, once we fixed that, the unit worked fine and has continued to do so."
5,Water Pik,I purchased this as a replacement and love the improvements. I have peridontal problems that use of the Waterpik has greatly assited in improving my condition. This one is efficient and very easy to use. I would greatly recommend it.
2,Weak,"Not worth the $[...]. It is now gathering dust. Since I couldn't get parts for my Interplak, I took the hose off the Waterpik and put on my old (but powerful) Interplak. It's a shame that the 5 star rating of the Waterpik doesn't hold up. My 9 year old Interplak does the job!"
4,More Than I Expected,This little device comes with a lot for the price. I was very pleased with what all came with it. Works very well and does a great job of cleaning in between your teeth. If you hate flossing (like I do) this is a great and way easier alternative.
5,messy but effective,I've had it for 2 weeksThis unit works well. It is messy.My gums feel better already!
4,Nice Pikker,Works great and is simple and convenient. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I found that some of the extra piks are really not worth the extra cost. I think a good brushing works a lot better than the tongue cleaner.
5,Waterpic,This was a replacement item -- our first Waterpic was given to our daughter when she had braces -- this newer version is well received as it has a smaller footprint on an already crowded bathroom counter and seems to be a very good purchase. One negative point would be there should be at least two sets of tips rather than having to purchase them as extras.
4,Waterpik for the family,"Good device and really gets stuff out from between your teeth, better than a tooth brush and dental floss (though not a substitute for either). It's got 4 cleaning picks and other gadgets. The cord retracts and has variable pressure."
4,great for braces!,"I have not used this, but both of my children have and they love it. It is much easier to clean their teeth and braces with this product."
5,waterpik,"This was a gift.. It arrived as described. So far she has great reviews. She is still playing with the different parts but has stated when she uses it, it feels as though she had her teeth cleaned at the dentist.."
5,water 'pic',"sturdy and very easy to use. great water pressure - haven't had a chance to try all the attachments yet. so far, the water pick works great ! would definitely recommend."
5,Amazing,"Bought the Waterpik WP-100 7 days before my dental cleaning which was today, all I can say is wow. Have shrinking gums with some pocketsin other words periodontal disease. Hardly any pain with the cleaning,spitonly one spot of blood. Gums have tightened up, pockets have shrunk,there was not much to scrape. My normal procedure for cleaning is electric toothbrush with toothpaste, then use salt, and floss. That never producedthis type of easy session at the dentist.So I don't care if this does break in six months, I will buy anotherwith these amazing results after only 7 days.Edit:About 14 months later, stopped pumping, pump runs but won't pump much. Cleaned twice with vinegar for 24 hours, still no go. Called Waterpic and only asked for the pump unit, they sent me a whole new unit, got it in two days. My gums are still good, highly recommended company and product.Old Mike"
5,Save Money at the Dentist,The water pik will definitely save you money the next time you visit your dentist. After being told I had gum disease I bought this and I love it. There is plenty of water in the tank for a good cleaning and it works great. I would definitely recommend this item.
3,"Very good, but with an annoyance","This Waterpik does an excellent job on the teeth. I am particularly impressed with the range of control for water pressure. My one complaint is the lid for the water reservoir. It must be removed in order to fill the reservoir. I have used devices like this for years that had flip up lids that made it easy to fill with water. This WaterPik comes with several optional attachments which are store in a compartment in the lid. Personally, I would have preferred a separate storage unit for the attachments and a single flip-up lid on the reservoir. I've been using this for over a month now and I still find this to be annoying. However, the bottom line is that this device is very versatile and does an excellent job at cleaning teeth and gums."
3,be prepared for the flood.,"I like this product and it does a very good job. This product cleaneout food particals better than floss. My only complaint is the water spray that will spray across the bathroom while cleaning your teeth. There is a control switch on the handle that is very useful. However, water still sprays out while in use."
4,First time owner,The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet is as described. It provides a great way to keep your teeth and gums in great shape. I can truly see a difference in the month or so that I have owned it. The water storage area is small and you will probably have to refill it a couple times while using it but that is the only drawback I currently have. It does what it is meant to do.
4,Good product,It's my first time to use this type of product and I love it!! There is no water leaking problem as long as you empty the water container after use. The water jet is strong and adjustable. The only drawback is that the machine is kinda noisy but I don't know if you can find similar products without noises.
5,Warrenty/replacement parts,"I love my waterpik ultra. I highly recommend it for anyone who has dental problems. After 6 months, the handset on my waterpik is leaking to the point that it is almost unusable. I called their toll-free number at 1-866-205-7802, and they took the serial number from the bottom and are sending me a new handset without charge. I hope it comes soon, because I can't live without this product! The two-year warrenty is a necessity. Don't be afraid to use it!"
3,"Works, but some minor design issues for me...","Works well and I haven't had a problem draining the reservoir in one use. I usually get two full uses before that happens. Gets the ick out and makes your mouth feel clean.My issues with it are that the button on the handle is for turning it off instead of on. My instinct is to press it to turn it on and releasing it should turn it off. So, that is something I will need to get use to. Also, if someone turns the unit on while the handle is on the base, water is going to shoot out everywhere. If you have kids in the house, this will be a fun activity for all but the housekeeper (aka me.) It would have been nice to have the button be the ""on"" switch and have a dial on the handle to turn the pressure up and down. Oh well, can't have everything."
1,water pik leaks,"I love the water pik, but it leaks all over my counter intermitently. I need to find a similar product of put it outside in the garden where it can water the flowers."
4,Waterpik review,"This is a really great product. I definitely notice the difference with how my teeth ""feel"" when I don't use the waterpik. It takes some getting used to initially, but it is well worth it."
4,Love it!,My dentist told me that my teeth gum is slashing up by brush around 10 years ago but never told what do with it. Finally dentist refilled with something between teeth and gum for 4 sections. I have suppose fix more sections. It was even covered with insurance but not cheap. I started research on website then found water pick. I took my best shot. I am very happy to have water pick in these days. It takes me three weeks to see my teeth gum is not sagging look anymore. I have to have an extra time to use water pick but I learned if I don't take care of my teeth well then I will suffer later more.
5,Impressed,"I love this ultra waterpik. My Gums are feeling better everyday, which is completely different from how they would feel after flossing. I would recommend you read the directions and start on the lowest setting when first starting because this thing will blow your gums off. I am able to turn the setting ups an I feel good about that because it shows my gums are getting stronger with every use."
4,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,The product came on time and I like it. I only wish I could have bought it a lower price
5,waterpik ultra,"Recomended by my dental hygienist. Works great! Bought two additional units for each of my children who are away from home in college. I'm certain that as as they age, they'll both need far less dental work than I did."
3,NEEDED BUT NOT GREAT,A MUST HAVE PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE GUM PROBLEMS. MESSY TO USE AND NOT AS STRONG A WATER STREAM AS I WOULD HAVE HOPED. MUCH BETTER THAN THE PORTABLE MODLES WHICH ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.
4,quieter Waterpik,I found this Waterpik to be much quieter than my last Waterpik. It has equal water pressure but is much quieter and less vibration of the tub unit. My only complaint is the Waterpik tip dislodging from the handle during operation. I am not sure if the detach button located near the top of the handle is accidently hit by myself (because of its location) or if I am putting some sort of pressure on the handle which is causing the tip to disengage from the handle. This action causes the water to spray either on me or on the wall until I re-engage the tip. Other than this problem I find that the unit does everything that I expected. I would probably buy this unit again.
4,Waterpik Ultra,Product setup is very easy. You need to remember to push the water holding tank firmly onto the base otherwise there will be no water flow. Unit is very easy to use and keep clean. Adjustments very simple but meet all requirements.
5,An excellent tool if you have braces!,"This Waterpik was recommended to my 13 year old to help clean between his braces. After being too cheap to buy one, I finally gave in when floss wasn't doing the job. What a great thing-it's fun to use, not messy at all, and does a great job on teeth. It replaces flossing, and parents can hear it running (not too loud, though) so you know they did it."
3,Short cord is a real problem,"We got this waterpik for my son who just got braces, and it's a life saver. Trying to floss under the braces was torture. My husband is also now hooked and is thinking about getting one for his office.I do have a complaint about this particular model, and that's the ridiculously short cord from the unit to the piece you put in your mouth. I noticed other reviewers remarked on this, but thought, how bad can it be? The answer is, pretty bad. We have an older pedestal sink with no counter surrounding it. My husband had to build a little shelf for the waterpik to sit on to be able to use it. He ingeniously used screws to stabilize the unit so you don't pull it off the shelf when you're using it. But you shouldn't have to be a carpenter to use a waterpik"
5,My previously dental-lazy hubby can't stop Water-Pikking now!,"We got this Waterpik based on the reviews here on Amazon. I'm a fairly disciplined night time brusher and flosser but my husband - who would previously sneak off to bed without brushing or flossing now scoots to the bathroom after dinner every night to Water floss AND brush!!He says he can actually feel how clean his gums and teeth are now. I love it too, especially when you see how all the gunk gets washed away so effectively. It is even kinda fun.On a more serious note, it's a well known fact that poor dental hygiene can lead to many more serious problems including possible heart disease and diabetes. So why risk all of that, just Water floss away!"
3,Not pressure I wanted,"Not sure if this is defective or just newer model. I have had this same exact machine for about 4 years till hose broke. The pressure was super, never needed to go above 6. On this new model, 1 is non existent pressure and I go to 10 just to get what was close to 6 on the older model. I don't know if they modified model or this is a dud. May exchange to determine cause used to be great machine."
3,Ultra Review,"I would not recommend spending the money for this one, the basic works just as well if not better. True the lower cost one is bigger and makes a little more noise but it is easier to use with the controls in the handle, has a larger reservoir and it actually is more powerful."
4,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet its a winner!,"I purchased this product for my husband on August, and it since to work pretty well. He's happy with the results of having healthier gums and cleaner mouth. It also has improved his breath tremendously. I would definitely recomend this product without hesitation."
3,Not as good as my older model,"I have an older model that works well, but had lost or misplaced the tips. It is also bulkier than the new model, so I thought, ""what the heck"" just get a new one. Well, the new one is more compact and works OK but it's not as powerful as the older model and all the fancy tips are just window dressing in my opinion. I thought about buying the travel model but noted that it is even less powerful. So, in summary, it's an OK product but nothing to rave about."
4,Feel great after water flossing,"I like to use Waterpik Water Flosser after my flossing. It feel fresh and clean. My dentist suggested water floss to me as a gum massage tool to prevent gum disease.We will see if it help after 3 months when I go to see my dentist for check up. I have bought this device for one month. So far it work wonderful, no problem."
5,Effective product!,"I've read some reviews that say this is messy, but I don't find it any more messy than brushing your teeth. It's really effective at cleaning and toning your gums--I already notice a difference after only three weeks. Also, your teeth feel incredibly clean! You should still floss between the teeth, but I can't imagine not using this product twice a day from now on. I haven't used all the fancy heads--I just use the basic plastic water pic head. Throw away the gum scraper (or better, recycle it)--it's useless, Toothbrush works better for that."
4,I am not all wet!,"OK, so I feel a little picky when I use it. But if this is a bad product, I'm all wet!!!"
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This is our second one in 4 years. My husband likes this one. Just in the past year the old one started to leak from the bottom. (He never emptied the water at night when finished, which I still do not think had anything to do with the leak, but thought I would mention this part). He loved this model because it was basic and wanted the same one anyway."
1,Product was defective.,"The product was defective. I was replacing another of the same model that worked great for years, but this one did not work correctly. Even if you had the strength of the stream all the way up, water came out at low preasure.I returned it."
5,Water picking,Bought this on the advice of my dentist because of a gum problem. It does indeed do wonders for gum health. It cleans under my bridges and in general has greatly improved my mouth conditions. Very easy to use - after a few wet accidents and inadvertent mirror splashings. Fun toy to chase one's wife around the bathroom. But I am very pleased with the machine and the results. I do like the ability to regulate the strength of the water stream.
4,For that dentist-office-clean feel,"It took me several days to get the hang of this water flosser. I've never used one before, and there was a lot of splashing at first. But it works great, especially with a about 1/3 Listerine in the tank. Just make sure you rinse and run a cycle with just water afterwards to clean out the plumbing.After using this flosser daily for about a month, my dentist noticed a major difference. They also advised me to use string floss at least once a week, but they said it's really just a formality."
5,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water JetThe product is really greatbut it needs a devise to attatch it to the wall
3,Waterpik Ultra,"The waterpik ultra purpose to clean gum and between your teeth is great,but the unit makes a lot of noise and vibrates across the vanity."
4,Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet,"Pro: Performs very well.Con: only two jet tips come with the unit. It will cost about $10, including shipping, to get an extra set of tips."
1,Disappointed - had to return,"It leaks at the place where the reservoir is attached to the unit and it pumps too much water so if you are planning to use Listerine, you will need about 1.5 - 2 cups per cleaning."
4,I'd buy it again,"I've had WaterPiks for over 40 years, and I have all of my own teeth, no gum disease, and good oral heath. I had to replace my old WP-60, as the reservoir had cracked, so i considered this one. I always read the reviews, to gain insight, and help decide. Most are very accurate, a few, a bit too highly critical.First, I find the style of this unit to be much nicer than previous models, and I've owned quite a few over the last 45 years.The hose is a bit short, but it does coil up nicely, and that is a plus.Mine does not leak, and previous ones left a puddle that i was always mopping up. I used to keep my old one on a folded up washcloth to catch all the drips.It is very quiet compared to previous models, I give this a real thumbs up.I really like the cover, it helps keep it clean, and just looks neater on my vanity.I would say it blends well style wise, yes, it is mostly blue, but, it's like a nice ocean blue that nost of us associate with the ocean."
1,Save the box for the return,"After five uses within five days, the On-Off switch went ""Pop"" and the unit was dead. Anyway the maximum setting gives only the minimum power to dislodge food from between teeth."
5,New Waterpik better than the old one!,"This item replaced our worn-out Waterpik that we had bought, and used daily, for more than 10 years. It is easier to use than the old one was."
4,Feels nice and tingly,"If you are like me, you are probably not the best flosser. I have never been super great about it but having the water flosser is great. It works really well and it is pretty easy to use Pressure is good and the provided heads are great to stay on top of your hygiene. Only con is it would be better if it was a bit smaller or thinner; that way it can fit better behind a mirror or wherever you want to store it."
3,Waterpik Ultra,"My dentist recomended this product to me so I bought it. It comes with different attachments which are very useful for different applications. For the most part this product is allright, but for me it has two major drawbacks. First tehe whose, it should be atleast 12"" longer, as it is you have to have the unit right by the zink and so gets messy. The second is that I feel is really underpowered, I feel that it does not have enough pressure to really clean gum pockets, which is what I got it for."
2,Bad hose,"I used this water pik for only 2 years. The hose was uncomfortable and tight and over the time the hose just simply broke. And it's impossible to replace it. It wood be more helpful if the hose was made from softer, more flexible material. :("
1,still waiting for the new era of ethical companies,waterpic decided that we only get 1 standard jet with each unit now but we can have five other useless attachments because they look good on the web page - they have reduced the power of the unit to further the uselessness of the attachments - the product is still useful but i will rate them with 1 star for negative effort and managing to make a fancier looking product that doesn't work as good as the older models and because i have to check off at least 1 star to submit the review
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect.","This was purchased for a 90 year old who was used to the Conair Interplak. Because it did not work well, we decided to give this new model a try. The pluses include the compact size, see-through reservoir, quiet motor, and easy to turn adjustment control. The water irrigation works well. Two problems, though. Every time the water is used up and the unit is turned off, the reset switch at the outlet is tripped. This did not happen with the other brand and it has caused frustration, since someone (an aide) must then reset the bathroom switch. Also, the on/off switch seems to be difficult for an older person to use. The up/down switch on the older model Waterpiks is easier for shaky fingers."
3,Didn't Last,"Got this almost a year ago. Didn't use it that much, yet it broke. Guess they just don't make Waterpik products like they use to."
5,Good Teeth And Gums,this is my second water pik and just like the first. its a great machine and helps keep my teeth strong and gums healthy.
4,I like it,I bought this brand new on Amazon.com. It was defective. The thing leaked water out of the bottom of the unit all over the place. I decided to contact Waterpik directly via email with an angry letter. A day later I received a response that they had shipped a new unit out to me (Amazon was also prepared to send me a new unit). Waterpik's response was fast with no questions asked.The new unit works great. The pressure is more than enough. I tried to use my new unit on 10 and my gums bled. I now use it on 6 or so and my mouth feels a lot cleaner. I'd recommend this to a friend.
5,Ultra Waterpik,Great product that works better than expected.My wife saw me using mine and now she wants one too.The water tank is the perfect size and emptys with plenty of time to finish my whole mouth.I highly recommend this product.
5,Great!!! it doesn't make me disappointed!,"At first,I did hesitated and wonder if this Waterpik will work.But I made dicision to buy it because almost reviews said it's great.And when I got it and try,your can feel at the moment that your mouth is cleaner as it ever.You should try too^_^I recommend this product."
4,Love it! Wish the cord was longer...,"After using this product my mouth has never felt cleaner! Beware of the short cord though. I feel I need to look in a mirror while using to see where I'm aiming. My bathroom sink has no counter top around it. The first night I was trying to balance it on the edge of the sink and the cord that attaches to the unit is not long enough - I ended up dumping the reservoir of water all over the bathroom. I will need to buy a stand that is the right height. Anyway, the product is great if you have a good surface to set it on."
4,Nice replacement for my old Waterpik,"I bought this unit to replace my old Waterpik which was at least 10 years old. The old one had a cover that you turned upside down to become the water reservoir. After all those years, it started leaking somewhere inside.I like this unit much better. They put a lot of thought into the design. The implements fit nicely under the fold-up lid and the water reservoir is dedicated to that purpose. No more waiting for the reservoir to dry before putting the thing back together and stowing it away.The only downside is that this unit is not as powerful as my old one; however, you have more precise control over the intensity of the water stream.UPDATE (7/6/09) - Well, the power switch no longer works. Didn't even last 2 years this time. I would change it to 2 stars if I could."
1,Pause button does not work,I had this only 6 months and the pause button does not work. It is frustrating and I don't think I will be able to get a new one without paying for it.
5,Works better than I thought,"I thought the boast that this water-flosser was better than dental tape was a bit too much, but when I tried this instrument, I was amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it cleaned my teeth and mouth. I would have bought it a long time ago if I had known how well it worked. Dental health is quite important to me, as I am middle aged, have all my teeth, and want to keep it that way. I am betting my next dental visit will be better than my last!"
2,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","I've been using a Waterpik for years and the one I had finally needed to be replaced. I filled the small reservoir with water and turned the setting to 10...the highest. It was a weak stream, something I wasn't happy with after having used my old one. Then the reservoir emptied. I tried it the following day with the same results so, I called the company (as requested) and the woman who answered was not one bit helpful. Her advice: ""it's the best we've got and if you don't like it, return it"". So I did and ordered a different model"
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This waterpk is just a supplement to regular dental floss. At first I thought I can use it as a regular floss to replace dental floss, but after using it, I still have to use dental floss to clean my teach. Good to have one."
4,It's just OK,"After a month of using this product, I'd say it works very well. I like its package of tips. However, it makes too much noise like helicopter sound. Amazon shipped very fast and packed very carefully."
1,"after 45 years of water pik, disappointed in the ultra","Have used the simple waterpik for over 40 years. Last one lasted 14 years. The new ultra has a cord that pinches and cuts off the water supply, replaced with new one. Power has gone down considerably after 2 years. Not the same quality."
5,Very usefull and cheap,"This ""machine"" is recommended by doctors here in Brazil, but the price is a joke(we pay almost 300,00 dollars for this product)."
4,Great for kids with Braces,"This waterpik arrived as described, works great! Good value compared to local stores, came with extra cleaning tips. I would recommend this product and this seller."
5,Very cool way to floss,"As an Amazon prime addict, I was looking to purchase regular floss and came across this. After reading all the numerous good reviews, I decided to buy one. It's a great machine, easy to use, effective, and well built. The rubber on the bottom keeps it sturdy as it stands on my toilet top since I do not have counter space in my bathroom. I can imagine this product is an absolute must if you are wearing braces. So far I've only used the regular water pick, but there different kinds for different uses. It's rewarding to see pieces of food come out between your teeth without the hassle of using floss which can be painful. I'm currently on power level ""4"", anything higher stings my front gums. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their mouth, teeth, gums healthy! It's also really fun to use!"
2,A step down from previous Water Pic,"The power of the water just has been reduced so that it is barely useful. The reservour is about half the size. If there is a better one out there, please let me know."
2,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,Shakes hard when I use it and it leaks water. Not near the quality I had been used to. If I had opened it up right away and saved the box when I did open it I would send it back.
2,worked for a while.......,"My waterpik worked great for the first few months of use. Shortly after about 3 months, the button that pauses water flow started sticking. Now, after almost one year, it is leaking from the button that ejects the attachment. The leak is so severe that there is no water pressure coming from the attachment itself. There is no way to fix the problem which makes it completely useless now. I am very disappointed that this happened. I thought waterpik was a good brand. I will be buying from a different company next time."
1,Stopped working after a week,"As others have correctly mentioned, this device is very low quality and does not last long. The Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet stopped working a week after I received it from Amazon. I'm extremely disappointed at Amazon for selling such cheap products. Save your money and purchase something else."
5,Best Waterpik Ever,"I have owned several Waterpiks. My only complaint has been how soon the waterhose cracks and leaks. This one appears to be very well designed, with several improvements, including directions about replacing the hose. The head can be swiveled which lessens twisting the line also. It is less bulky than previous models. I am impressed with this new model."
3,Service from Waterpic Sux,"The product works great, wish i could use mine. The button which stops the water malfunctioned (stuck off) contacted support suggesting that they could just send the replacement part. They agreed, lost an email with my address and finally said they sent it but would take 20 business days. I am still waiting. really, how hard would it be to send this item priority mail. It has been over a month without use of this product."
4,Waterpik,Had for two weeks and my dentist said it has helped my gums. Best buy for dental health. Would buy it again for the best dental health.
4,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"I grew up with the waterpik. I decided it was time to revisit the best way to keep my mouth fresh & clean. For me, the highest setting of 10 was needed. I find only the basic flossing head worked the best for me, the tank held sufficient water & overall the machine did a great job.The instructions mentioned that there should be no space between the handle & the flossing head where it inserts.....if there was I should call the 800 #. There was, so I called...I was told the instructions were wrong. That there should be a space. Ok....There is some clean up afterwards....no biggie for me; I would like a wee bit more power behind the wash (I have very healthy gums) & it could be quieter.This model is easy to use. I would absolutely recommend this product."
1,Water Pik Ultra,I returned this product. I used it for at least 14 days and noticed no difference. I didn't feel like the pressure was strong enough to really do anything. I also sometimes didn't start even when it was turned on and I had to start and stop it several times to start.
4,great investment,This product was the best thing that I have purchased in a long time. It is simple and small in space. It cleans great and it's also easy to clean.
5,Great product!!!,"This is a really great product it literally can save your life. Great, clean teeth are a joy. Don't wait get started today."
5,WaterPik Flosser,We haven't used the WaterPik in years. Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!
5,Waterpick Ultra Dental Water Jet,We are most pleased with our Waterpick Water Jet. An excellent product at a very good price.
4,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This product works very well. It is easy to use and has a wide range of selections for pressure of the water. Also, it comes with 5 or 6 attachments for various uses from crowns or bridges to braces."
3,Excellent product but just for a month,"Excellent product - This was my first oral irrigator and I absolutely liked it.The only con: After a month of use, it no longer develops instantaneous pressure. I need to wait for ten to fifteen seconds before it pumps up and sprays water. Not sure what's causing that and haven't bothered to call them up and ask."
3,one more time: defective jet handle,"I bought my Waterpik in November, 2006, and the jet handle has failed twice so far. Both times, the pause button became stuck. The second time, water also began leaking out of the end of the handle where you insert the different tips. Waterpik has been good about replacing the defective handles, but the failure rate on the jet handle is very high. You'd think Waterpik would redesign it to prevent these problems. OTHERWISE, I really like my Waterpik. It does a great job. And, as I said, Waterpik's customer service has been very accommodating. I just wish I didn't need to go through the hassle of replacing the handle every 8 or 9 months."
5,super,"My dental hygenist suggested that I buy one and use it in an area that collects food and even flossing does not remove. Well, I can tell you that this does the trick. I only wish I would have purchased one sooner. It does a great job and my wife loves using it also."
4,"Waterpick - Overall, a good buy","I rate this as a good buy and am pleased with it in all but one respect. I believe that the line (hose) transporting the water to the hand-held nozzle is a bit on the short side. That having been said, I would not let this lone short-coming prevent me from buying this product again unless Waterpik or a competitor came up with a better product."
4,Waterpik Dental water jet,I find this to be a very useful addition to my dental routine. While I brush and floss thoroughly at the end of the day I am amazed some times at the number of food particles that this also washes from between my teeth and below my gums. While I so not believe that this is a replacement for flossing I do see it as a great addition to it. Members of my family also find it to be extremely beneficial for the additional cleaning around their braces.
4,Excelente!,"Aparelho muito bom para uso diário, fácil e prático. Produto chegou antes do prazo e em perfeitas condies de entrega."
4,Better than older generations,"I've owned several of these over the years, and I like this one the best. For starters, they improved the switch so it actually STAYS ON while you're using it. What a concept. The white cover over the tank is a storage pod that holds all your accessories. That thing seems a little sloppy to me, and they could improve that design a bit, but not a show-stopper. I don't like to floss, so this machine really helps me keep up with dental hygiene. I thought it was a good value for the price."
5,Totally pleased,I couldn't be more pleased with the Water Jet. This my second Water Jet. The first one is many years old and still working. Bought a second one for seasonal residence.
5,Best ever,Very pleased. This is my third unit over a period of 10 years This has a brush surroundin g the pick that works great. Suprised that everyone doesn't use a waterpik.
4,not bad,"not bad but you still need to floss,also you need to empty the water every time you use it otherwise it will leak"
5,Works Great,I have been using this product lately and it works great. The Water Jet has various speed settings which increase pressure gradually and helps in cleaning the gum tissue. I am very happy with this overall.
5,water pick,"I purchased my waterpick and am very pleased with it. It has more than enough power and has the attachments. When I purchased the item it stated that I would receive 8 attachments, however, I only received six."
4,Waterpik,"This unit replaces a very old Waterpik I had. It's smaller so it's easier to store when not in use, but can also be left out. I would appreciate a longer cord for the actual pik device, but still is a nice little unit that gets in those places your brush can't."
5,Why didn't someone tell me about this before?,"I am an adult wearing braces. Now, think about trying to floss your teeth while wearing braces -- not an easy thing to do. My oral hygenist suggested that I try a Waterpik instead of trying to thread floss between my braces. She also suggested the cordless Waterpik for travel and taking to work. I bought them both at the same time, and my life is so much easier now. What a time saver this is! I highly recommend this and the cordless Waterpik. My teeth have never felt so clean. Why didn't someone tell me about this years ago? Don't wait to get braces to try it!"
3,Have bought three in as many years.,"It does its job well, but is not built to last. On two of them, the plastic hose became brittle and broke in about a year, and isn't replaceable. So I had to buy a new unit. The third unit just arrived, and the on/off switch is not attached to anything inside the machine, and just flops. So I had to return it. I am looking for a product that does the same job and is well-constructed."
3,meh,"i've used this about 2 or 3 times--as a gum stimulator it is excellent, but it's quality as a flosser is questionable. i flossed after using this product and still found pieces of food stuck to the floss. i bought this because it was getting quite difficult to floss my teeth after getting braces installed. using this is better than not flossing, but this product is NOT a replacement for regular old flossing with good technique."
5,Excellent refreshing post-meal rinse,"My 14 y.o. got braces, so knew this was a necessity (having owned an old version of the WaterPik as a youth when I had my braces.)After his use there at my ex-wife's house, and my trying it out and loving it, bought a matching one for our house too!I use it after every meal when I'm at home."
3,Like the old model better,I love my pik its ok not as powerful as the old model and I dont like that it blasts on right away...takes two hand to operate. But I do like the design of it now the way it curls up and goes back into place nicely
5,Water Pik review,"I had one of the original Waterpiks from over 30 yrs ago. My husband and 4 children were still at home, we each had our own color of pik. We thoroughly enjoyed it. During a move 10 years ago, I misplaced it, but found it a few months ago. I dusted if off and started using it again. It always had a loud, noisy motor, but still did a good job cleaning. The poor old thing died a couple of months ago and I didn't want to be without one so found it online and ordered another. It's much quieter than the old one and cleans just as well. I am so pleased with it that I bought 3 more for Christmas presents for my older grandchildren to enjoy. It always amazes me how much ""stuff"" is left in your mouth, even after brushing. I'm hoping that it will cut out most the teeth cleaning at the dentist's office that I dislike so much"
4,"good, but button sticks","this products works very well. at first i had it at the lowest settings. as time passed and i used it more often, i was able to turn it up just a bit, maybe to level 3. anything more than that isn't comfortable for me. the blue button on the wand sticks and you have to pull it out or tap it against the sink to make it pop out."
4,Much better than old WaterPik,"I'm a dentist so I know a little bit about oral irrigation. I've had WaterPiks since they were introduced(mid 70's). My last one I have had for about 15 years,still works but it's getting old. This new model is far and away better. Time will tell how well it holds up. Dr. R"
5,L.L.Fitch,"I had a Waterpik years ago and got rid of it for the fancy battery toothbrushes, and floss but this make you teeth and gums feel so much cleaner. So now I use a combination of all three. Love! It Love It!"
5,None Better,"Had Water Pick's at my house since they first came out in the 70's. They have all been good but this one is the best. And the price... go figure how they can keep it so low. Sturdy, Quiet, Easy to use. What more can I say? I own 2."
1,Don't buy this product if you live in Europe,This item is a US product that does not work in Europe and has been a total waste of money. I have spent 20 on a transformer and it still doesn't work and it should not be on the Amazon website for sale in the 220/24V AC areas.
4,Messy but worth it,"So this product takes a little while to get used to. The first time I tried when I was done it looked like a shaggy wet dog had shook himself all over my bathroom! But now I've gotten much better after a few weeks of use and can contain the spray. My dentist was very happy I bought this and suggested to string floss, then brush, then waterpik and there should be almost nothing left on or in your teeth! Works for me."
5,Good purchase,"My gums have been with problems ever since I had a surgery in 2007, flossing did not help so my dentist recommended a water floss and wish I had done it before. I do the water treatment after flossing and I see some food particles that will be flushed out only with the machine, so I am very glad I bought it as there is a big difference."
4,Tank too small,"This is my third Water Pik. It is primarily used for nasal irrigation with a Grossman tip. My tip did not fit this unit but I heard about cutting off the tooth tip and pressing on the Grossman tip, and it works great. Anyone with sinus infections need this unit. However, my old unit had a large water tank and this one is half the size. So, I mix my saline solution in a 1000 ml container and have to pour half during the irrigation. No big deal, but this unit really uses the water even on the lowest setting.. It is much better than my old 650. I haven't used it for teeth yet but I am sure it will excel. And the Amazon price cannot be beat."
1,stuck on button,after 5 uses the on button will not work. Have to unplug to get it to turn off. Of course all the original packaging was thrown away because it worked fine for a short period
4,"A little messy, but your teeth feel so clean","I am only giving this product a 4 out of 5 due to the mess it makes. It could be my lack of coordination skills, but we purchased this for my son who recently got braces...well needless to say it makes a mess out of my bathroom and whoever is using it. lol I think it is a product that takes some getting used to."
3,"nice and compact, but...","We replaced our older model with this one. While it's more compact and nicer to look at on the counter everyday, it lacks the power of our older less, attractive model, plus there are a myriad of attachments we will almost never use, which are stored in the water tank cover, but it doens't snap shut, so that's a little odd too.All in all, it's got great contemporary looks, but could use more force and functionality."
3,Weak Water Jetstream,"I bought this waterpic to replace a 10-year-old waterpic that I had dropped and broken. This model, though while new, has a noticably weaker water jet than the old model it replaced. I would have thought that with all the time and wear and tear on the old pump that the new machine would have a much stronger jet. Also, the water holder holds only about 2/3 or less of the old model, so the wash only lasts about 40 seconds or so. Disappointing."
4,A helpful product for your dental care needs,"I'm having dental issues and thought this might help with a more thorough cleaning. It does just that. It's more thorough then flossing alone and works great in combination with brushing and flossing. Takes a bit getting use to (and you might end up with a few squirts to the face) but well worth the time, effort and price."
2,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"Big dissapointment. Bought it to replace older Waterpik model. Looks nice but does not have enough force to be effective, even when using the tip with the smallest orifice. Not only does it lack the power, but water reservoir is too small. Maybe that's why it is quieter than previous models. Looks better, and is smaller than previous Waterpik flossers, but does not do as good of a job, and the previous models were only average products with a lot of reliability issues. Waterpik never seems to be able to get it all together even though they have had years of experience with flossers. If there was ever an opportunity for a good competitor, water flossers is one."
5,Taking the Tedium Out of Flossing,"Bought this the week the Orthodontist installed braces on my eight year old daughter. Braces make flossing very tricky, especially for a child. Turns out she didn't like it from first try: too much water; too difficult to avoid messing the bathroom. Her twin brother on the other hand, who we often suspected was not doing the best job flossing or brushing (without braces), absolutely loves it and this product we are sure is enabling far greater maintenance. I am using it as well; alternating daily (with dental hygienist approval) between this and traditional floss. I am certain it is doing a great job.Only minor nit is our bathroom has two sinks, each near their own electrical outlet. We move the base unit between the two sinks. A minor tweak to the design would ease the portability of the base. In current design, a child (or an adult with wet hands) can not safely move the base to where it's desired."
3,Water Pik Ultra Water Flosser As Advertised,"This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser was just as advertised. A little smaller than I thought, but it works for me. If you want to use it amongst different people, you should order extra attachments, as there is only 1 of everything, and not everything fastens in the storage compartment. The cord between the hand unit and the base could be longer."
4,Waterpik got it right this time,"Hey, it was my diligent (very diligent) dentist who recommended this Waterpic when I complained about the hand-held version I was using. With this model they got it right: no battery to re-charge, an array of ""picks"", including one to clean your tongue, and my dentist's favorite, the Pic-Pocket for getting under hard to reach gum lines. The price is right too, at Amazon."
3,waterpik,I like the way the pik functions. It flosses well!I just find that it has a design flaw.All parts to the pik are stored in the top white cap.This cap does not have a clasp so every timeit is removed the contents fall out.
2,Not As Good As My Old One,"I am quite disappointed. I had a WaterPik for years which finally gave out. I bought this new one -made in China of course, and it just seems cheaper. Thinner gauge plastic I believe, ill-fitting lid, leaky wand and water delivery is uneven.To top it off- they do not include two of the most used tools for more than one person but give six one of a kind tools like orthodontic tool and two with brushes. You have to order another set if 2 people want to use the same type tool.I bought WaterPik because of it's reputation and my previous good experience with it but I fear that reputation may be going down the drain if you will pardon the expression."
5,Good waterpik - great price,This is a very nice Waterpik and so easy to use. My husband even uses it - and that is a first.The price was better than we could find it in town.
3,"Replaces Flossing, but Not a Quality Product!","The Waterpik was recommended to me by my hygenist, and although Amazon's price is highly competitive, and the product works adequately, it is flimsy, and in my opinion, not well-made. Not many pik/flossers on the market, so it is probably the best in its category."
3,Not Suitable for Use by More than One Person,"If you look on the bottom of the unit, it has a little sticker which says ""do not use more than five minutes in any two hour period."" I came across this after trying the unit several times in a row only to find the motor was beginning to grind to a halt.Fortunately, the unit recovered after I gave it some time to rest. Note there is nothing in the written instructions regarding this product limitation.Hence this is strictly a one person use unit, providing it is only used perhaps a maximum of three times a day.Also noted the same issue as others with not having enough storage in the container provided to actually hold all of the utensils which come with the unit.As for the pulsation intensity, it seems to be limited. Probably both to protect the undersized motor and to minimize gum damage from too agressive use.I really wonder if this unit is going to last the three year warranty provided."
1,Terrible quality,"I've been a WaterPik user for years, and been very disappointed with the quality of recent products. As others have said, the tank on this model leaks badly. Even worse, the handle assembly simply falls apart and starts leaking around the release button, or fails to release the tips. I'm about to order my THIRD replacement handle assembly, though I hate ""rewarding"" WaterPik for a shoddy product.Next time I buy a dental irrigator product, I'm going to try one of WaterPik's competitors."
2,Water Pic Just OK,Had an old water Pic which was much more powerful. This unit lacks power and has to be filled up twice to do all your teeth...I am not totally happy with this purchase
4,My bridges luv it,"My upper and lowers are now 90% bridged and this ""flosser"" cleans as no floss and toothbrushcan do... add rinse of your choosing and WOW !Ample power and settings but I feel water cache too small.Nice ompact unit. Too many attachments in unnecessary storage lid.Thanks,70+ year old guy in Hawaii"
4,Waterpik flosser,"For most of my life, I have been a dedicated user of Waterpik's. Unfortunately, they seem to wear out faster with each model I purchase, and am hoping this won't be the case with this latest one. I did notice that the pressure is slightly lower than with my previous models, but it still does the job. The reservoir is also smaller than I would like. Everything else is pretty standard and simple to use. I don't purchase the deluxe model since it has too many additional features/implements that I don't need. Reliability and simplicity work the best for me."
1,The Worst - Don't Waste Your Money,"Because it was Waterpik, I thought it would be good. I needed to replace my prior water flosser so I purchased this one by Waterpik. Not only did it fail to deliver the necessary force, it was messy and difficult to use. I threw it out."
3,"Ok, but weak water pressure","This is our 4th WaterPik in probably 6 years. The others lasted about 2 years each (WP-65 or WP-70). Hopefully this one lasts longer.This WaterPik has a cleaner design, but is not necessarily easier to use. One has to remove the cover to fill the water reservoir, and one has to open the cover to get a tip. On the plus side, the handle is a better design: it has an eject button to eject the tip and the water line is straight and stronger near the handle, so it is not as easy to get cracked as before.My biggest complain is the water pressure - it is bearly enough! I almost returned it. We finally decided to keep it. We use the max setting to get enough water pressure."
5,Clean Teeth,The Product is an awsome one I've had it for two month now and no complaining it's powerful enogh for a deep clean with alot of attachment I love having it around and poring some mouthwash in it for that extra kick I would reccomd this product to my friends.
4,Teeth that go *BLING*,"This product is great. It seems to be powerful enough to blast the gunk out from between your teeth and I can notice a difference in my gums appearance in just a month of using it. It kinda massages the gum-line while it blasts the food out. The only thing I can say is a down side to this unit is, the fluid reservoir is fairly small and at 90psi I only get about 2 minutes or so of squirt time. I like to thoroughly clean my teeth before bed, and I use one full reservoir for the upper teeth, than another full reservoir for the lower. Another downside is the noise. Its a bit loud (relative) for such a small device, it shakes and thumps about like the dickens but so far, I have not heard a complaint from my roommates. For a small, affordable water flossing solution, I would recommend this unit easily."
4,Not as powerful as the Waterpik Ultra bought five years ago,"It is quieter than my five-year-old Waterpik Ultra, but the trade-off is the powerfulness...For the old one, The level 7 is my up limit of tolerance, while I have to move up to level 10 in the new Ultra to get the same feeling of clean flossing. But whether the teeth need superbly powerful daily flossing is still a open question.PS. My old Ultra still functions as well as before."
5,in re Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"I was very pleased with my use of this item that I purchased at Amazon. It has exceeded all of the claims statedbed in the Amazon description of its virtues. It quickly removes food particles impacted between my teeth; it cleans this intertooth space more rapidly and more efficiently than the use of dental floss. It efficiently removes the remaining tooth cleanser after brushing, It is a significant improvement over my previous Waterpik appliance which ca be described as a toothWaterpik Ultra Water Flossercleanser/remover. I strongly recomment it for all adults."
5,LOVE IT!!!,We had one of these when I was a little kid and we used it all the time. It works very good and has enough tips for everyone in my family. My daughters are both getting to the age where they need braces and I thought this would be great for keeping their teeth clean.
2,could be great,"For the first couple of months it was great. Then the button on the handle stopped working (it would stick ON or OFF), and I eventually got used to having to start and stop the flow with the power switch. Then just recently, the handle started to leak and I can't use it without dribbling water all over. I think it's too late to get a replacement so I am pretty much stuck with a messy, inconvenient machine that will sit on my sink until I figure out what to do with it :S"
2,Waterpik WP-100,"I have had this waterpik for 2 weeks and the button on the handle is already sticking. This is creating a problem, especially if you are irrigating your nose. It is also hard using the grossan nose adapter. The water surges out until in a certain position. I have had 3 waterpiks prior to trying this new ULTRA. I prefer the older model for my usage."
1,Unhappy with Waterpik model WP-100w/c,"I am a first time buyer of the Waterpik Ultra 100 w/c. The tank is too small and the motor seemed troubled and stopped after our first use. The manual said the Waterpik could only be used for 5 minutes before needing a rest to cool down before next use. We tried every thing in the manual to make it work. After an hour of doing whatever we could, I am sending it back. Motor sounds bad with a beeping sound that would start every time it was turned on. Looking forward to trying again (as all good Americans will) every time I need a good cleaning. Long live our one sided trade with China. Is it too late to relocate the American firm?"
1,"Cheap, not inexpensive","I would hope that my experience was not typical ~ the motor failed to turn on which severely impeded my ability to really evaluate the item. My sense is that for a product such as this, inexpensive is probably not the best way to go."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a Waterpik Ultra in November of 2007. In as little as two months of use the handle is leaking and does not allow for continued use. I have been unable to contact their Customer Service department through their website or by phone. Apparently there is no Customer service. Another American company that has failed to provide a product that will last more than 2 weeks. I have reviewed many customer complaints on this product and I find that my leaking problem seems to be the main complaint from everyone. Oh, did I mention that they sell extra handles for $5.50? And the stock seems to be out at this moment. I would not recommend this product or any product from this company this."
5,Delighted with the new model,"My first Water Pik was over 14 years old and it was difficult to find replacement piks. I upgraded to the new model and am delighted with the product. The new features such as the special piks designed for those of us who have had gum problems and the very handy control on the device that lets you easily interrupt the water supply while inserting or removing the pik from your mouth are significant improvements. At times, I wish the reservoir held more water but it is not a big deal to refill it, if needed. Those who wrote negative reviews will find that, over time, it gets easier to use."
5,wonderful,This machine works wonderful and my mouth has never felt cleaner. I only wish that I had purchased it sooner. It comes with several accessory pieces and even has its own storage container.
1,Its Trash after only 5 months !,"Purchased in December and now on May 5th, only five months later it's in my bathroom trashcan.Motor has always been weak compared to previous Waterpiks I have owned, but the real problem with this model is the water cord to the nozzle wraps up and kinks and once that happens there is no way to clear it.Save yourself some time and money and look elsewhere than this model."
1,Not what it used to be,"I have used Waterpik brand for over 30 years. I have owned 4 in that time. Boy, has this product gone downhill. This first one lasted over 20 years. The third one broke after a year. Of the 2 my husband and I just ordered, 1 has very little water pressure, even on the highest setting, and the reservoir empties 4 times faster than the last one we'd purchased a year ago. It does not last long enough for me to clean all my teeth. The second one is only a little better. I will never buy this product again. I can understand an occasional ""lemon"", but we ordered 2 and neither one works well. So disappointing after being a lifelong fan."
1,It was broken whent it arrived,I was very excited to get this product. I had one before and I loved the way it worked. I just got this one and it doesn't work. I am returning it.
2,unsuitable for Australia,Product was not labeled that it could not be used in Australia. Even with plug adapter. Item blew up on first attempt. No information from the seller to advise that it was not suitable to international power. So overseas purchasers beware.The item itself arrived as described in good time.
1,Doesn't suit Australian voltage,Believe this product to be good but had to return it as voltage is not suitable for Australia (240 Volts).
2,"Shoddy engineering, poor quality results.","This unit feels cheap the moment you remove it from the box. The water pulse is strong but the unit is unwieldy and very difficult to use effectively, and even when used properly leaves plenty of plaque and bits of food between teeth. The water flosser it replaced (an Oral Breeze) didn't work very well either, but at least it was cheap and easy to use, convenient, and didn't require daily cleaning or severe caution in using a pump motor with a full tank of water near an electrical outlet. Forget letting your kids use this thing -- it'd be dangerous. And whose bonehead decision was it to make the unit pump water freely as the default action, with a button needing to be pressed to stop the flow? I've made so many messes because of that lunacy and I've only had this thing a week. Pity there's no money back guarantee, because even though I almost never take companies up on those, this is one instance where I would. This Waterpik sucks."
2,Waterpik Ultra Flosser Fail,I hate the design and fit of the reservoir lid. It has a compartment to hold the extra picks and is awkward to remove to add water. I tried to leave it off but the pump vibration spays water all over. The shape of the lid and the little lip that has to align with the reservoir makes alignment to put it back on very precise. Makes you feel like your assembling a puzzle or a clock instead of a lid just to keep the water from splashing out. Remove the lid to add water the wrong way and the storage compartment opens up and one or more of the extra picks and attachments fall out. The fitment of those is another mystery puzzle. Very user unfriendly. The product engineers must all have dentures.I miss my cheap old water pick and its elegant reservoir design with a hindged lid.
4,Waterpik W-100,"Overall this Waterpik is well-designed, quiet and easy to use. The water chamber could be a little bigger and it retains some water after the use. The On and Off switch could be more convenient if it were vertical instead of horizontal. My husband, a dentist, and I are pretty satisfied with it. Miller, Fairfax, Virginia"
5,LOVE MY WATERPIK!,I FOUND MY TEETH FEELING MUCH CLEANER WHEN USING THE WATERPICK AND MY GUMS TOO. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
3,Water Pik Ultra Water Flosser Review,"This unit is not as powerful as the last unit we had. I use it on max pressure of #10 all the time. Not too happy, but it's good enough."
2,No zip with pik,"This is the 3rd waterpik I've had and there is something wrong with it. The water jet dosen't have the force of the previous 2 that I've owned. The dial to adjust the force of the water goes from 1-10. In the first two I would set the dial around 5-6 and that gave plenty of water pressure. On this one I set it at the highest level, i.e., 10 and it feels as if I have it on 3. I called the 800 number of waterpik and told them of the above. The gal that I talked to was rude, nonresponsive to my concerns as if I were an idiot. She instructed me to perform a certain task, which I had already done per the instructions that came with the waterpik, and when I repeated the instructions the waterpik still didn't perform up to the standards of the first two."
4,Minty Smell,"The first time I used it it was like coming out of the dentist. Liked the product a lot and in combination with toothbrush and Listerine, the experience is delightful. Only have it for two months or so."
3,Leaked after 13 months,"This was a great product while it lasted. My last one lasted 2 years. Buying from Amazon allows me to keep track of how long I've had a product. The motor still works, but the tubing sprung a leak. This is quite disappointing, and yet what other product can fully replace it? So I would give this product a rating of 5 stars for the time it lasted, but the quality must be slipping based on my experience."
4,Good little unit,Nice unit for the cost and size. Operates quietly enough with enough power to get fresh teeth. Should help with the future dentist visits.
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works as advertised and is improving the condition of my wife's gums. The price makes it an excellent value.
4,Works as advertised,The unit was for my wife and she says it does a good job and she is VERY satisfied with the product.
5,WOW! I just had my teeth cleaned!,"At my last dentist visit the dental hygienist informed me that my gums were bleeding and that I wasn't flossing. Well,of course she was right but I didn't let her know that. You know, I don't hate flossing but I don't enjoy it either. So, I picked up a Waterpik. I increased my vitamin C intake so as not to suffer the ""Yo Ho Ho...."" scurvy disease, and religiously started using the Waterpik, and now my gums don't bleed--yes, it feels like I just had my teeth cleaned, yea!"
5,Great Product,I love this waterpick flosser. I love that it's electric and not a rechargable battery (hate those). I love that it has different power selections and I love that it has a lot of power behind it. I love the coil hose and how easy it fits into it's holder. I love the different pics that come with it. I love that the reservoir holds so much water. It's a great product and I would highly recommend it.
5,Good stuff,"My boyfriend introduced this product to me - I have bad teeth but too lazy to floss everyday. Waterpik cleans my month without a lot of trouble, I love it!"
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"I bought this product because it was advertised as having the stongest water pressure. You can always turn the pressure down if needed. I think the Waterpik was advertised up to 90 psi. It's ok but the old Interplak it was replacing was stronger. I thought about getting another Interplak, but they didn't advertise as having sufficient water pressure. The Interplak was advertised as having about 70 psi."
4,Great product,"Arrived very fast, and in great condition. My dentist recomended this item as I have bridges that are hard to get floss into.It works wonderful, and so much easier than floss for bridges, and tight areas."
2,Poorly designed considering the cost,"I have had one for four years. From the git go, I had problems with the lid. It is not hinged and it easily falls into the water tank. The clamp that holds the water pik is plastic and it eventually broke but I always had problems with it holding the pik. Whenever the pik is laid flat which happens sometimes when it falls out of the clamp, it leaks water. Apparently, there is a gravity flow. If properly designed, water should eject only when it is pumped. This could also be alleviated if the switch on the pik had to be pressed in order to get the water to flow. As the pik functions, the button can be pressed on the pik to stop the flow but when it is released the flow commences. Personally I would prefer it if the water did not flow until I pressed the switch on the pik. However, what finished the pik off was that the hose began to leak where it comes out at the bottom. Poor design having the hose underneath the pik."
1,First impression - Ignore this product,"If first impressions make lasting impressions, then this model of waterpik has failed miserably. I bought the WP-100 which even after my best efforts refused to work! Well an hour later I returned it. So much for the hype on the waterpik website!!Does the manufacturer even test these before shipping them? How many products go DOA?Well, I got it exchanged for a Interplak WJ6RB. The product atleast worked the first time and worked again today morning."
3,A NEW product to try....,"On a quest to improve the health of my teeth and gums, I went on amazon and began my search.Two things seemed to make sense to me. One I have and love, was a product called showerbreeze... which is basically a fantastic invention, somewhat new and super easy to use. It hooks up to your showerhead and is basically similar to this item, but you do it in the shower.. and use the water from your pipes. Easy, no mess, no refilling, and whenever I shower, I use it. It gets rave reviews.The next thing is oral-b power flosser, which I have not tried, but people say it is easier and better than regular flossing, especially if you have no space between teeth and the floss gets stuck. Supposedly, the vibration helps the floss get between teeth easier. I am ordering one today.Hope this helps you decide what you want to buy.On a side note, I am not affiliated with any product, nor do I make a penny on any of this. I just wanted to spread the word on what I found.thanks"
3,Good but...,if you have not a power outlet in your bathroom first you have to install one and after take care about safety against voltage. In rest it's good and very useful
1,CHINA MADE!!,Exploded inside from the first useAnd I wasted my time reading how to use itDidn't last one day afterall
2,Watrepik,Our dentist has been recommending this product to us for awhile. Have tried it a few times but not to impressed so far.
3,Not for me,"First of all, it didn't work but that wasn't the sender's fault. I sent it back and tried a new one from a local store. I really didn't like it at all. The water ran out right away, and really, the extra gadgets that came with it were useless..."
5,"great, Great, GREAT!",Finally.A product with all the features you want - at a nice price - that works perfectly every time you use it. I wish everything I bought worked this well.Powerful jets. Quiet operation. Big reservoir. Many tools to choose from. Low price.Worth every penny.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Bought the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet on September 27, 2008 and it no longer works as of today December 27, 2008. To only work for 3 months is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! Just like that there is no water pressure anymore. When the Waterpik works, there is nothing that beats it for oral hygiene but this product or any other should not be allowed to be sold if it can not work MINIMUM one year... Amazon's return policy is only good for 30 days so now I have to deal with Waterpik directly. There is a 2-year warranty through Waterpik..."
1,yet another leakage in the handle after only a few months of use,"We are very disappointed with this device. We bought it only a few months ago and have been using it regularly, two adults, once a day, but recently the top bit of the handle started to leak big time and the waterpik has since become unusable. This is very disappointing. We are going to have to trash it and find an alternative product. Personally I find it simply scandalous to market such rubbish products. Yet another consequence of nonsensical outsourcing and frenetic globalization. I'd much rather spend twice the price for a reliable product, rather than one that lasts four months and will end up polluting the planet a bit more."
1,Engine failed,"The waterject failed to operate after a few times (less than 10). The engine is dead, no water came out."
3,Mr Clean,The waterpik needs a much longer hose. It would be nice to have a hose long enough to reach from the vanity to the shower. I would also like a larger water reservoir. This is my first waterpik and I have only had it since Dec 2007. It seems to do a nice job so far. Mr Clean
5,Waterpik ultra dental water jet,"This product works exactly as advertised, easy to use, powerful, effective in the aid of good gum/teeth health care. Was recommended by my dentist and he was right."
5,no more bleeding gums,i get food stuck between my teeth everywhere and bleed with all the flossing i have to do. my gums were inflamed and bleeding often because i could never get rid of all the particles with brushing (use electric) and flossing. my gums bled for the first few times i used the water pic and now i just get clean teath and gums. my mouth doesn't taste as bad in the morning. i love this product and won't do without anymore. wish someone had forced me to use this years ago. hope this helps someone make up their mind positively.
5,Great new model for me,"I have had a Water Pic like this before but was over 10 years old. New one is more powerful, attractive and less noisy. Really like the outcome after using it."
4,Good product and price.,"This is a very good product and good buy, but I wish Waterpik would include more than one standard pik with the product."
1,MALFUNCTIONED QUICKLY,This Waterpik was terrific UNTIL it stopped working and seemed to clog up after a short period of time. MY husband tried strightening the cords going into device but nothing worked.
4,clean Gums are a good thing,It works fine...price was right and it cleans my freaking teeth and gums...does everything I expected4 more words were necessary before you let me submit.....How utterly simple and silly.....
3,Broke Holder,This water pick has good water pressure. It's cleaning ability is very satisfactory. My problems are two fold: the holder is brocken on one side. the pick unit retains a black mold on the inside of the handheld unit. All my methods to clean it did not work. I need high pressure low maintence unit.
4,Needs larger reservoir,Would have given this item better marks if the reservoir were larger. I like the function that can turn it off on the handle. Would buy again.
1,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed in this product. It makes too much noise and can not be used when my children are sleeping because the noise wakes them up. It seems poorly make and I broke the first attachment I used when I removed it from the attachment handle.I was expecting so much more quality from this brand name.
3,Works good short term,"Bought this in October, 2012 for my husband. He uses it once a night.It has been 4 months and last night it quit pumping water. Up until now it was a nice machine- worked well, good pressure and cleaned well. Four months is too short of a time for usage. Would not recommend purchase."
4,Flossing is Fun again,"Get ready, what I'm about to say is gound breaking:Flossing is Fun!But seriously, this thing is really cool. I'm actually okay with flossing now. My gums don't bleed yet I feel like my teeth and gums are twice as clean and fresh when compared with normal flossing. This thing has 10 speeds so you can start out low and work your way up. My only gripe lies within the upper speeds. Once your on speed 8+, you don't have much time. The machine runs out of water quite fast at this stage so you've got to be on your toes.Ultimately, it's a minor inconvenience on an otherwise great product."
4,Great product!,"This product is very good and has settings 0 to 10 for power. I wish the power was just a bit stronger to get under my bridge work. Othewise, this product is a great buy."
4,Waterpik,"I purchased the Waterpik ultra water flosser at the recommendation of another user. I just began with peridontal work and decided to upgrade my oral care by adding waterflossing too. Although only having used for one month, I am very happy with this product. I read reviews before I bought it -- and didn't care much about noise (there is some noise) and other criticisms. The Waterpik works and does what it is supposed to do -- I feel that my oral care is greatly enhanced by this product."
5,Nice and quiet,"Very happy with my purchase. I'll use it till one of us dies. Purchased to replace the older one I had, which I out lived."
5,Better than flossing,Much more effective than flossing in my non-dental opinion. Helps around crowns where gaps may be. Works great and it is very effective.
4,Met My Expectations,The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is great and a better product than the old or original Waterpik. I like the fact that the water reservoir is covered and thereby protected. I also like that the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is more compact than the older model allowing it to fit into any space.
5,Great Product...,"The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is a great product. I got this product at the end of 2012, and I use it everyday to clean out any debris lodged in between my teeth before flossing. It works great for doing this exact job, and in my opinion this is the only job it needs to do.The only con that I see with this unit is it would be nice if it included more than one classic jet tip. The other tips in my opinion are pointless. The water flosser should be used to 'floss' your teeth, not 'brush' them. Many people may disagree with this opinion, but I believe that if instead of all of the pointless tips, there should be four classic jet tips that are color coordinated so multiple members of one's family could use it without feeling 'grossed out'. Personally, it doesn't bother me to share, but I know my wife would appreciate her own tipSo far, there is no leaking, but I will continue to update this review with any quality issues."
3,A Mystery for Meg,"My book was about a girl who was named Meg and she lost her parents when she was little.When she lost them she went to live with her Uncle,Aunt,and her cousin on a Maine Farm.She has two pets a cat and a crow.My croe and could get out of holes no one new was there.One day when I was casing my pet crow and I heard a voice so I turned around and it was my brother.Then we asked my Uncle Duncan if I could go to and stay at an Island that he was working at and he said yes.I think people who like Mystery's who liuke this book.I think they would like this book because it has a lot of mystery's in it."
3,"No NEW answers, just better answers","The text that this solutions manual is for already has short answers to some of the exercises in the back of the text. This solutions manual contains more complete answers to those same exercises, period. These detailed answers ARE quite helpful in understanding those procedures. One of the weaknesses of the original text is that it has some exercises that request the student to perform procedures not specifically explained in the chapter (or previous chapters). Unfortunately, none of those exercises are covered in this manual. If step by step explanations to just some of the exercises are what you are looking for, this manual delivers, and delivers well. If you think all the answers to your course homework lie within, you'll probably be disappointed."
1,Long Time No - SEE,"Spend the extra $100 at homedepot or lowes and get the extra tool. Amazon ships by ""Eagle"" who received the item over a week ago and never updates! ""Estimated date has come and gone with no product."
1,Most pointless book I have been forced to (almost) read,"I also had to read this book for AMU. I can't believe that this book actually has 4 stars from user reviews. As noted by some here, this book offers nothing new. It basically tells you how you learn in about 100 different ways. I read the first chapter in its entirety, but after that I only read enough to get by in the course. The author goes into unecessary detail about how posture, scent, surroundings, etc help one learn. There are tons of surveys throughout the book so you can learn things such as if you learn better alone or with others. I think we all already know what we prefer and don't need pointless quizzes to tell us."
1,Pointless,This book told me nothing I couldn't find on the simplest FaceBook Application quiz. Completely pointless and a little painful.
2,whimsical at best,"I just have to say that I am suffering, trying to get through this book. It is required reading for a college class, and I actually came online to see if I could find it as a book on tape so that I could just play it in the background while doing something else. There are little bits of useful information here and there, but honestly, the woman sounds like she is writing for a small child. Perhaps this would have been more useful for students in the 6th-7th grade."
1,see Gaetan Lion,"To spare repetition, please see review by Gaetan Lion. I couldn't agree more with this review. Don't waste your time or money with such superficial fluff. Its books like this that make me think, ""what connections did this author have to get her book published""??"
1,Wasted time in my life I can't get back,"I read this book for AMU, I am assuming that no one read the book prior to placing it on our reading list. Had they read it they would have known it was a snooze fest. I had more fun watching paint dry. Most of what she said was simple common sense. I already knew I was a visual learner, and I am not a huge a reader. To be honest after chapter 3 I gave up. After week 3 no lessons refer to this book. I am glad they sent it to me free."
3,the star spangled banner,"i'm not a huge fan of crosby or nash (""so far"" is a nice release) but you gotta admit they're harmonies are pretty top notch. also i think the title of this album is fun, that their mothers were in the audience, etc., but it's kind of like the pizza tapes in that the fun induced by the banter decreases exponentially with each subsequent listen."
3,Too Stoney,No wonder I don't remember anything about seeing these guys perform except hitchhiking there and back. Stoney indeed. In retrospect it makes for a very ho-hum disk. I'm selling my copy and going back to the studio recordings when I want a fix.
1,not fair + mistake from amazon,"Not fair to those who bought the original CD to add bonus tracks that cannot be purchased separately. Why make me buy the whole CD again for three songs?Plus the sound sample for the second bonus track ""Cathedral"" is actually the song ""Orleans"".And... the other two bonus tracks have electric instruments on them so the CANNOT be from the same show, as the ""Stoney Evening"" show, which was all acoustic.Terrible release all-around, shame on everyone involved."
4,annoying previews,I would have given it 5 stars if it wouldn't have had those annoying previews and advertisements that you couldn't skip in the beginning of each disk. Very irritating. I hope the rest of the seasons aren't like that.
2,No Booklet,"Although the DVD's are really good, the box didn't came with the booklet, which contains the summaries of the episodes."
2,"This item is good, but I have better...","I don't mean to down the remastering team for putting this new collecters item out, but I found better. You will save hundreds of dollars if you really must have the dragon ball collection like I did. [...]Again this is not a put down, just trying to save you from spending too much money and waiting around for the next season.It's not digitaly remasterd, but it gets the job done. The wait time will be about three weeks or so, but once you have the whole series at your finger tips, there will be no need to wait for the next digitaly remaster season.[...]Make the better choice for yourself, and save money and time."
5,Dragon Ball,"Love it,Its great to see how the series started out. Glad you can still buy this stuff. and its so HD!"
5,gift,"Great buy, needed for x-mas gift. Told it would be here before new year qame before x-mas,nephew has the others and was ecstatic when he opened it up."
3,"good show, bad discs","I really like this anime.It is cute, funny, and has good action.This product came to me in great condition...new,pre-packaged and without damage.However, when opened, found that a couple of the discs were already scratched.I was hoping it would still work fine,because they were not that bad.After a few episodes in, my XBOX 360 couldn't read the disc, and it kept messing up.My wish to you is that you don't have the same bad luck that I did."
4,Dragon Ball The Beginning,"I have been into DBZ ever since I was young and just a couple years ago started watching it again, and decided to actually watch Dragon Ball since I never watched it when it was on Toonami. I like how in Dragon Ball it's more of an adventure and about how they grow and focuses more on their training. So I decided to purchase the first season, but I was afraid to since I heard that since 2011 Funimation decided to go green and stop having the season booklets in the Dragon Ball season sets. Thankfully when mine arrived it did come with the booklet along with my Season 2 set which came last week. So just to let some buyers know the booklet may not be included. I know it's uncut but I wish that some of the perverted scenes were left out, to me the show is better with less of it. Overall though I would recommend this product to any fan of the Dragon Ball franchise."
5,The Biggest anime franchise's adventure begins,"This DVD contains 31 episodes of the first season of Dragon Ball. PROS: Came here really quickly,Came in great shape all five DVDS came with it, BRAND NEW. CONS: RUDE HUMOR.You'll meet lots of lovable characters from The small but strong Goku who has a monkey tail to Bossy Blue haired Bulma who likes boys. This DVD is great can't get any better than this. Can't wait to get Dragon Ball: Season 2. Brings hours of fun. There are somethings that little kids should not see. Besides that it's awesome! . Okay for 12 years old and up. THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN BY MY SON WHO IS TWELVE."
5,Great,"Came in quick and my brother absolutely loved it for Christmas. Exactly what I ordered, came in great condition. I would recommend buying this item from this seller."
4,Dragonball Season 1,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.
5,Let the eagle fly,WOW! We love this frame it is very nice and looks super on our car. It would look magnificent on any car.
5,Great Birthday Gift,My husband is an avid eagle collector. He was VERY surprised and well pleased when I gave him this for his truck for a birthday gift. Nice weight of metal and chrome. Looks more expensive than what I paid for it. Would buy agin.
2,Huh?,"I am an advanced Adobe Premiere user and I wanted to try my hand at After Effects. I didn't want to blow $50 on a training book so I bought this one. The packaging and content look great. However upon attempting to read the book, I had no idea of what it was talking about. It doesn't do a good job of talking you through what you're doing...so I guess I'll be blowing the $50 on another book after all."
1,Useless,"Unfortunately, this book consists of a series of how-tos that are all disconnected, and that cover features that are overly simple and not helpful. I'm glad I checked this out at my library before buying!"
1,Wow!!,"I was really surprised when I heard this CD. I expected it to be similar to other Gregorian music I had heard, but was very surprised when I heard the Monks belting out popular music.I had to double-check that this wasn't some secret Wierd Al Yankovic project, but it appears to be on the level.It's really sad when a resource like the Gregorians are forced to try their hands at singing classic Rock Songs. The Pink Floyd tune ""Wish You Were Here"" was really quite amusing. When ""Stairway to Heaven"" came on I nearly crashed my car. I wiped tears from my eyes for about 10 minutes after that song.I would not recommend this CD to anyone unless you have a wierd sense of humor and enjoy hearing talented groups flop badly."
4,nail head trim,These work really great. If you have really thick fabric or foam use the longest nails available. They do tend to bend if you don't use a punch.
2,Very cheap,This trim did the trick but it was as thin as paper! You couldVery easily break it in two. I have seen other nail head trim that was much thicker- I guess you get what you pay for. It did work for the piece i was using it for (headboard) I don't know that I couldRecommend it for chairs or curved furniture items.
4,Telephone Sholder Rest,The product fit our phones perfectly and was delivered very fast. Very satisfied with this order. Price was great also.
3,Telephone Shoulder Rest,"is adequate. It is a smaller version of the very comfortable shoulder rest that one could buy in the 1980s. This is, right now, the closest I could come to the older model. It sticks to the back of the phone well and makes it much more comfortable to hold the receiver between chin and shoulder."
2,poor quality,"Shoulder Rest comes with double-sided adhesive strip already applied to produict. However, the double-sided adhesive strip was incorrectly applied by the manufacturer which would cause your hair to get stuck in the adhestive. Better quality control is needed!"
2,Too Slippery,"I needed something to free up my right hand for writing while on the phone. Other hand can't hold a phone & I remembered the big old things they used to use with old time hand sets. I just couldn't find one that saddled over the shoulder. This one wasn't really what I was looking for but it had decent reviews, so I got one.The two sided tape works fine. It's almost like welded to the handset. Be sure it's positioned right before sticking on. You don't get a 2nd chance.But it just doesn't work very well for me, because it's too smooth. It slips too easy on fabric so it slides right off my shoulder all the time. I was going to try to stick the toothed part of some stick-on Velcro on it to see if that would work but I wound up getting a head set system instead."
1,Threw It Away!,"This shoulder rest fell off the phone the first time I used it. I did everything correctly and carefully - cleaned off the phone first, let it dry, applied it carefully. It didn't stick in the least.I bought a cheaper one at an office supply store and it works fine. This is worthless."
5,Just right,"I had a previous shoulder rest that finally fell apart after many years of use. I'd heard these were very comfortable so I purchased this one and it's wonderful, very comfortable and simple to install."
4,saved my kneck,This saved my kneck should have bought a long time ago.. what was i waiting for? it stays put on the phone...
1,More of the Same,"This book could not be more predictible, or less informed. It is the same old ahistorical modernist rant: market capitalism destroyed real community, real meaning and, for that matter, reality iself. Whatever you make of its politics, or its lack of originality, the most damning criticism is that it exhibits a visible lack of contact with the anthropological or material culture record. It makes no meaningful contact with social history. But, being careful really doesn't matter much when you are on the side of the angels: beating up on McDonald's and modernity usually requires little more than the will to do so."
5,Very Interesting Book!,"I was suprised that George Ritzer's ""McDonalization of Society"" is actually on here! I thought it was just considered a text book because it has been used in colleges throughout the country, including mine. I had to read it for my Sociology class and it kind of sounded boring at first. Later however I began to enjoy it. I wrote an evaluation of the book for the class and it's too bad that it's too long put on here...'cause this really is a great book. ""McDonalization.."" is not really about McDonald's company itself, but how other companies have been influenced by McDonald's and have a similar system of running their business. Examples they include range from Starbucks to Wall-Mart. If you're one of those people who get annoyed sometimes as the coorporation monopoly's on society then this book is for you. I really reccomend this book to anyone even if you're not a college Sociology student."
3,"Quality, but not comfortable","I have many styles and colors of Easy Spirit shoes. I have always equated Easy Spirit with comfort. While these shoes are high quality and look very nice, they are not comfortable. I believe it is the shape and size of this particular type of heel that evades the comfort level that I am accustomed to with Easy Spirit. If you are looking for quality these are for you. For comfort? Buy something else."
5,For any fan of Dmitri and Anna,It was a performance to celebrate 300 years of St. Petersburg.the detail of the interiors and the costumes is very interesting.
5,VERY HELPFUL,"I bought this game and game guide for my husband last year for his birthday, he LOVES it. In the game it gives you the chance to pick if the bard will be snarky or nice, and depending on what you pick will vary the outcome of the game, and the plot. He has replayed the game serval times. Who doesn't love a game where you can be nasty to a person that deserves it? The game guide was a help for finding routes, the map was a blessing and it has all of the locations of the secrets. worth the money I spent for the guide and shipping. It was delievered nicely, not damaged, and on time. I was thrilled!! This game is not for children, it is a bit too violent, for teens it would be okay. A great game and a must have guide."
4,Non-Fiction,"An interesting guide to the use and history of these particular cards and practice.For someone that doesn't know a lot about it, probably even better, as it is certainly not too esoteric or mystical for your general person.Also some bits and pieces of numerology and Kabalah later on the book, to look at some related subjects and uses.Certainly worth a read if you want to find out something about this subject."
1,None,"I did not purchase this product due to the cheap printing which makes it hard to read and to use with the tarto deck, especially when using during a reading. I did purchase a poorly printed Original Rider- Waite which is so grey and murky that I doubt it is worth buying a product dealing with the aesthetics of the Tarot when itself is lacking in aesthetics."
2,disappointing,"We ordered with great expectations. Print was hard to read; pictures were poorly printed. The text is OK, but we have seen better Tarot guides."
2,"Too ""mystical""","Eden Gray was great as spending a lot of time saying nothing. This book is a testament to that legacy. Her insight to the tarot is nothing more than warmer over Pictorial Key by Waite only ""vaguer"" and her ability to write is questionable; no wonder she spent countless hours in her Mt Kisco home answer angry letters and since she died at 98 in 1999, so you can't be one of them."
4,Tarot card reading,This book made it alot easier to read my cards. The directions that come with the cards is way too hard to read.
4,Interesting subject,"This is a well written book. It is an unusualsubject, but interesting to learn about. Afterreading this, I gave it to a neighbors sonand he tells me that it is a good learningtool."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This is basically a trumped up (pardon the pun!) version of the little book that comes with the Rider Waite deck. Not very helpful beyond that.The 78 Degrees of Wisdom by Rachel Pollack (spell?) is a much better reference, more detailed and in depth details on each card, as well as the history of the Tarot."
2,Not the greatest,"I found the printing hard to read, and the illustrations in the paperback were very poor. The description for each card is fair for the Major Arcana, but for the Minor Arcana it simply repeats what anyone can see on the card. (Or could see, if the illustrations were better.) The divinatory meanings seem mostly derivative of Waite. There are many better books out there, IMO."
2,"Fine on Background, Light on Details","Nice broad brushstroke overview of Six Sigma, but never really got into the heart of the matter. Certainly not a book to check out just prior to an implementation kick off- more in line with mulling over the ""does Six Sigma matter to me"" question."
1,Lean Six Sigma or a selling technique,"Well I can say the book is ok. However, I do feel like this book is more about them trying to sell their services to me than to teach or explain Lean Six Sigma... If I wanted to buy consulting or training services I would rather not have it shoved down my throat in a book. ."
5,This Book is for those who Want To Get It Done,"Micheal George is by far one of the world's authorities on Lean Six Sigma, and this book goes beyond the point of proving this.Lean and Six Sigma are naturally drawn together, and Micheal George is able to articulate this in a way that we can all understand.If you want an academic exercise on Lean or Six Sigma, then call the author directly and I'm sure he can provide a solid few hours of conversation and mentoring. However, if you are an industry practitioner, with a busy schedule, and want a playbook...then buy Lean Six Sigma and follow along chapter by chapter.This is a great book. It is a book about how to get it done. It is a book about action !"
1,Great anticipation brings great disappoitment,"Yes, you cannot judge a book by it's cover, but this book did not deliver on my expectations. If you are a senior manager, this book is for you as the vast majority of the book covers how you need to structure your organization, but not much real discussion of Lean or Six Sigma. This book provides a brief discussion of six sigma tools and almost no discussion of substance on Lean tools. It is a bad sell to tell a reader that a Black Belt should save $1,000,000 per year. After several lengthy discussions on how to set up structures, the author goes on to state that this may not apply for you.Good high level book. Not great for much else."
2,Intellectual Piracy,"This book was a rip-off of Philip Crosby's works such as ""Quality Is Free"" and ""Quality Without Tears."" Just subtitute ""Lean Six Sigma"" everywhere for ""Quality Improvement Process (QIP)"" and it's the same methodology for implementation. Book, chapter and verse...I should know: I worked for Mr. Crosby for four years."
5,excellent book,"This book guides me through the whole six sigma philosophy and tools involved, setting a right path for my future work and studies. I enjoy the way the author organizes the information, which allows me to quickly beef up the knowledge base."
3,Not for young families,"We were looking for a video to help our kids learn better table manners (and a few pointers for us as well). I think this video is too focused on elegant dining and does not have enough content for average parents and kids (things like passing food, excusing oneself, ordering in a restaurant, eating with fingers). It is very slow paced, with only Michele talking to the camera and little change of camera angles.The best part of the video is a classy backdrop and her coverage of some basics like spaghetti, soup, etc. It is helpful and I didn't see other videos that looked much better, but I think parents should try a more family-oriented video first."
4,Tim the Bassist' review,"Brian is phenomenal on the upright bass. For connoiseurs of jazz standards and upright bassplaying with an all-star cast, i highly recommend this project."
1,Cheesy elevator jazz,"In the dentist's office, waiting to get a root canal. Looking forward to it, actually. The dull pain of the needle injecting novocaine deeper and deeper into my jaw is far better than the bland monotony of this music. Music shouldn't be about playing by the numbers and executing a smooth sound without inspiration or enthusiasm. This album is the opposite of music. It's where tired jazz came to die in a sad imitation of itself. I don't even know what that means: warning, this album is so vapid it kills brain cells."
1,No Good,"My city got rid of the Wave elavator jazz station a year ago. When I put this on I felt like it was all back again.Very watered down, same old processed sounding thin dentist office jazz. Very disapointed, I would expect this from weak musicians.nothing fresh, or creative, and the covers?? I would rather hear the artist's original versions much better feel."
2,fair,I have seen a lot better DVD's of Elvis. This was not a favorite of mine. It was some of the same things that have done over & over & over. Not something I would recommend to an Elvis fan. I would not suggest that Impact! Songs That Changed The World / Elvis Presley - Heartbreak Hotel to be something that I would watch over again.
2,Nice music . . . weak interpretation,"Alex Mitchell made a wonderful selection of American music for saxophone, however I was less than moved by his interpretations. He exhibits weak and choppy phrasing (he takes such long and ill-timed breaths, and so often!). The technical execution is equally poor, with unclean attacks, weak articulation, and way too many flubbed notes (I'm surprised they kept these takes for the CD). All in all, his interpretations lack connection with the music. I hear the notes, but no passion whatsoever. He even lets the piano outshine him at times -- I don't know any saxophonists that would allow that!"
2,Great Music Poorly Performed,"When I saw this cd, I immediately bought it; my goal being to understand the Creston Sonata better, as well as listen to an actual classical baritone sax solo. However, when I started listening, I found myself doing double takes...could a professionally recorded player really be missing notes?? Turns out this was the case...what a shame...This occurs on several tracks of the cd. Though the blips aren't by any means obtrusive, they're by no means hard to find...His stylings are a little unorthodox for some of the pieces, but all-in-all not terrible. I will say that the way he and the pianist handle the last several bars of the 2nd movement of the Creston is one of the best I've heard...it's perhaps the only recording I've heard to make sense of it.All in all, if you're looking for recordings of these pieces, I'd personally look elsewhere...but that's just me..."
4,The isometric workout,The workouts are excelent for what they do. I wish the dvd was setup so you could customize your own workout by linking segments together for times when you have more time to workout. Other than that I am completely pleased with the workouts. Jb is a little on the cheesy side. but a good motivator while your body is screaming at you.
2,boring,"As far as isometric exercises go this DVD is very boring. The two girls standing behind the trainer are just tall skinny models who are being paid to smile. No one looks like they are working very hard. If you want a really good isometric DVD, t-tapp is far superior. I'm only glad that I wasted $20 and not more."
2,disappointing,For what I spent I thought there would be some kind of booklet or something included. Instead all I got was a DVD in a case. LIke when you buy the cheap movies at Walmart.
1,Not a tribute CD,"I bought this album figuring that it was a collection of well-known friends and musicians paying tribute to a great band. It is in fact a cover album by an unheard of group calling themselves ""Sad Reason."" This wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that you have to open the cd and break a security seal to find that out, making it impossible to even refund what you've just purchased. Bottom line, if you're an AIC fan don't buy this CD...the original is so much better."
1,It's Not Mad Season,"Here I sit, a Brit who loves AiC and I hoped that ""Sad Reason"" were going to be LS's real friends and compatriots from Seattle even the guys from Mad Season. However, what we get was a very good musical copy....... but, who the hell is the pretentious singer?I was very disappointed and I recommend that ant AiC fan avoid this and wait for Cantrell and Inez to put together a real Tribute to Staley's legacy.I have total faith that one day they will find vocalists worthy of the lyrics.Thank you for reading, and thanks to AiC... ""if you change, well I'll love you anyway""CheersMark"
2,"Awesome Karaoke, Poor Tribute","This album is basically the ""Alice In Chains"" Karaoke Album but with the studio singer's vocals turned back ""on"" (compare with the karaoke songs on this site, they are identical).I bought the Karaoke Album version (not this one) because as far as the music and back-up vocals go, it was top notch. The main vocals on this album were never really meant to be a quality rendition, simply an example for singers to hear how the main vocals are sung."
1,Goofballs,"Maybe they were thinkin', ""Hey dudes, I got that Staley dude on tha mic,you bro's can jam tha music"" and then some idiot thought they would actually put this CD out. The musicians can play; the singer is offensive.I hope you s$#&heads; read this review! How disrespectful can you be?! Ohyeah, we've heard.J Funk"
1,Bunch of crap.,"Wow. This sucks major ass. I'm a Huge Aic fan and I thought this was atribute. This is more like a poser band. Layne Staley from the real Aic has a great voice. But the singer on this album sounds gay. That's like an insult to Layne! This album tries to sound like Aic, but there are things that are missing. 1. The guitars are not distorted and not fizzled out enough2. The singer sounds nothing like layne staley. He sounds gay.3. I heard the solos don't come close to cantrells.4. The drums do not match Sean Kinney's drumming.You see, this another tribute that sucks major ass. It's just as bad as that pantera tribute. Go spend your money on the real Aic albums, Like Dirt or Facelift. Whoever thinks this album is good must be retarded."
5,Great on everything!,"This steak sauce is great with any kind of beef. I use it with hamburgers, meatloaf, steaks, everything!"
2,"It's weak, and outdated.","Not very useful for somebody thrown into the job of managing telecomm equipment. Some good tips, and deciphering of lingo.I learned more by just doing the job, and learning from the support services company (Black Box,) than I did from reading this book.The author goes to places that the average telecomm manager does not need to go. A more useful book would discuss interfaces to the various kinds of switches that the manager might find in the US.Not a complete waste of money, but very close to it..."
5,Solid Gold Soul Inspiration,"Great CD full of artists that have made a significant impact on popular culture. The music of my parents generation, this CD provides contemporary listners a true idea of how significant these artists were to a generation of African Americans coming out of segregation and discovering self-pride."
3,decent introduction,"Ultimately, Baggini seems more interested in defending atheists as people than in explaining why they don't believe. Baggini defends atheism against charges that it is immoral, amoral and meaningless. But he doesn't really get into arguments for atheism, other than a few comments about reason vs. superstition. For example, I would have liked to see a bit more on ""god of the gaps"" and the slow, steady debunking of most of the ""truths"" of the Bible."
3,Atheism...,"I purchased this book for my Philosophy of Religion class, on my kindle. The only downside to this book was that the pages were not listed, only the location within the book. I could not flip though chapters. When it became time to site my work for papers, it was extremely hard not knowing the page number."
3,Letting go of prejudice,This is a good introduction though it requires an individual to release certain deeply embedded beliefs and deny cultures that may be tattooed on your soul. Limited thought-provoking. Requires alot of insight and imagination by the user.
1,Pompous,"Although I am essentially an atheist, I found this book and the author's style to be distasteful. The author presents his arguments without a complete defense and then repeatedly asserts that he has proven his points. Likewise, when he mentions the opposition, he doesn't waste time citing and refuting their evidence; he merely pronounces it illogical and repeatedly asserts that he has discredited the opposition.I haven't read anything else about atheism, but this book was not what I was looking for. Surely there are better presentations of atheism available. This book only served to reinforce the stereotype I have of other atheists."
3,Some Ideas - Maybe,"Of the several books and other materials that I have read on this subject there are points expressed well and in a different way, but then there are many things that are the opposite, not at all well expressed. There are places that seem to have not been edited. There are sentences that just do not make sense. He speaks at times like his words are for a generally well educated audience and uses excellent terms to communicate. Then he changes radically and uses terms that are more arcane, more for the philosophers and the highly erudite that are steeped in their use. He wanders back and forth with this kind of writing. He seems to not believe that one can be an agnostic, but then makes an intellectual stew that sounds like maybe he does believe there can be such a thing as agnosticism, but does not want to call it that. It winds up muddled. He is sincere in his purpose, of that I feel sure, but he does not achieve it."
5,Great Introduction,This is the best introduction to Atheism out. It is calm yet forceful and reasoned. Makes a much more convincing (and philosophical) case for atheism than Harris or Dawkins.
1,Don't buy this one,I don't recommend this minnow bucket. Water leaks thru the styrofoam into the bucket. It then pushes the styrofoam up and pops the lid off. I returned it and the replacement did the same thing. Ended up throwing it away after chasing the lid down several times.
1,"The Bee Gees ""songs that changed the world""",Do not buy this DVD!!!! There are no songs being played. Just people making comments about the Bee Gees. This should not have been offered as a music DVD!!
3,Nice to add to your collection,This I was a little disappointed but not to much. It was interesting and well I loved the music in this. But it was not what I expected. It was also interesting as well.
4,Perfect,Excellent book if you care to maintain a good relationship. The chapter on Communication is especially good and suggestion to improve how to talk with your mate helped me a lot.
4,A star is born in 125 pages.,"For a Porsche Boxter lover, this is fascinating collection of facts. You will find the entire history of the making of this superb car, with great pictures. A must !"
3,BOXSTER S INSIGHT,"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS BOOK,I DID NOT REALIZE THE INFORMATION WAS DATED.THE BOOK WAS PRINTED BEFORE THE HIGHER POWERED S MODEL WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLIC IN 2000.IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR AN S BOXSTER,THE INFORMATION IN THE BOOK IS OK FOR BASIC INFO,BUT FALLS SHORT IN HELPING TO MAKE A PURCHASE FOR A MORE CURRENT CAR."
3,Wishing for more,"This is a coffee table book, a quick read with lots of pictures. In that sense it is a good book, but for those who are seriously considering a boxter, this book leaves more questions than answers."
3,Resin strap is BLUE not black,"Bought this one for leisure/casual wear but suprised to see the strap BLUE, I think it looks better in black..."
5,Perfect for a 1 gallon bowl.,If you are looking for an UGF for a one gallon fish bowl look no further. What can I say plug in your air line and it works great. If you are using a layer of soil for substrait I would refrain however. The filering action will help leach the tannin in to the water giving it the look of tea.
4,Good for 1-2 Gallon Tanks,"I use this for a 1 gallon shrimp tank and a 1.5 gallon fry tank and it seems to do the job. Needs to be replaced every two weeks though, as it gets dirty quick, which maybe me over feeding but overall it aerates and cleans these small tanks. Would have given it a 5-star rating, but the prickly plant won't stay in the base properly so I just jam the plant in a coral instead."
2,ehhh,Should come with the tube that you have to attach to it to even work. Very vague instructions. cheaply made
3,1 Gallon Filter,"This is pretty good for it's price I suppose. Note that you have to buy an air pump and hose to get it to work. Also, Betta owners beware, the plastic plant will shred your betta's fins to pieces."
1,when i first got it,WHEN I FIRST GOT IT I WAS EXCITITED THEN I RELIZED IT NEEDED/ DIDINT COME WITH A FLEXIBLE AIRLINE TUBE AND WAS WONDERING IF IT NEEDED THE AIRLINE TUBE
1,It doesn't work...,"This filter doesn't work. It doesn't do anything. I don't know how it is supposed to clean the bowl because there is no way of forcing the water through the filter. I wish I had realized before buying it that you had to buy additional product. I have a small fish bowl, so I wanted something small and simple. I don't even know what I have to buy to go along with this thing."
4,white yarn,"I was happy to find this yarn. I was the benefactor of tons of yarn when my mother passed away. Unfortunately, I started a project with this yarn and needed one more skein. This yarn has been discontinued. I was surprised at the price since it was 3 times the regular price. There were only 3 skeins left from this vendor but only purchased one because of the price. Even at $5 a skein I would have purchased all 3 skeins but $10 a skein was way too high."
4,Most engaging book in years,"I'm the type to read 2 or 3 novels in a year. They usually take a lot of time and effort to get through.Getting throught the almost 400 pages of Banana Boys though, took almost a week and a half; and I couldn't read fast enough. Each of the 5 main characters is a foil of modern Asian Canadian angst. At the same time each character's story animates the larger narrative. This story is not just for Bananas - yellow on the outside, white in the middle. This book is for everyone searching to find out how they and their peers are melting into the modern Canadian mosaic.Highly recommended reading."
5,Excellent Comprehensive Guide!,"I found this book to be very clear and easy to understand. It has a lot of technical information conveyed in plain english. I also liked this book because it answered all of my questions, it has everything you could ever want to know about colloidal silver, and is up to date with the most current studies. Mark seems to truly know what he is talking about. I reccommend this book to anyone interested in making or using colloidal silver!"
3,Colloidal Silver: Making the Safest and Most Powerful Medici,"This book is an excellent primer on the subject of colloidal silver. It's full of reasons and stories of why you'd want to use silver in the first place. If the reader happens to be beyond that point, the less than informative directions for the old 9-volt battery-operated colloidal silver generator may not suffice. There are cheaper, easier and more eco-friendly methods of colloidal silver manufacture available. Nobody beats Mark for his ""time in the trenches"" though. The information in the book is crutial to the new medical ""researcher""."
1,What's the diameter????,"This cake stand looks so graceful and sleek, but there is no mention of the diameter measurement! How stupid! I'd never buy it without that. Please amend."
1,Cushions are terrible quality - do not buy!!!!,"The ottomans are beutiful when you get them out of the box but in less than 30 days they look like they are 2 years old! I covered/protected them since the day they arrived and given they are outdoor pieces, this should not happen! I would like my money back!"
1,too big and cushion too white,This ottoman is huge and the cushion color is not as shown. I wound up using it as a coffee table between the chaise lounges and threw away the pillow.
3,"JUST A FEW ""to much"" FILLERS","Really good album. With one big missing song. THAT BEING "" most precarious"". What isn't so great on this hits album is the FILLER songs. Songs that are not needed. SUCH AS : regarding steven, mulling it over, mountains win again (TV commerical), love and greed and crash and burn. REALLY all the rest are great, thats like 11 songs, plus the missing hit (most precarious). THUS 12 greatest hits. And thats enough. Sometimes to much, ""FILLER SONGS"", can hurt a greatest hits type album. And here it does. It has been almost 8 years since this was released, should be another ""HITS"" from this band soon. Maybe they'll get it right this time? But what is here....is really good that's not filler......so don't drop those songs next time BLUES TRAVELERS."
4,Awesome CD,Travelogue is a compilation of many of the popular Blues Traveler songs and is a must have for anyone who likes this band or wants to get an idea of what the band has to offer musically.
5,Hurst replacement springs,This kit fit perfectly with no problems installing it. I have a brand new shifter again without spenging a small fortune. Thanks :-)
3,Not good for books,"I bought this backpack because I liked the idea of unzipping the smaller pack to use as a purse, and zipping them together to head to work/school. But the larger bag is not suitable for books. It has straps that will hold clothing in place, like a suitcase does. I gave it just three stars because the description and images on amazon did not give enough information about the internal organization of the bag."
4,Travel to Europe,"I bought this as a bag for carry-on and a few-day trip from my host's house in Germany. I ended up using the small detachable bag as a purse and bag for walking around Paris. It is also a small enough pack to not have to be checked at the Louvre and other museums. The larger part was great as a carry -on when unzipped from the smaller pack but together the two were too large on buses, subways and planes. It did help that I had packed spare clothes in it since my checked baggage for my 2-week trip was lost. As a combo for 5 days in Paris it did the job and the trip to and from the train station was easier because of its ability to zip together.It held up well and I can see using it again as baggage and/or a small backpack."
2,Cool idea - bad design,"i took this to europe for a few weeks, i really liked the idea of two bags zipping into one unit. over all a good bag, and i really like that the larger of the two pieces has a shoulder strap (like a suitcase) and compartment to hide the shoulder straps. the biggest problem, and reason i would not use it for backpacking again, is it is not balanced.when full and zipped into one bag, it is top-heavy, and sticks out way too far behind you. basically, it pulls you backwards, so you must lean forward a bit to feel balanced with your center of gravity. i read a review that mentioned this issue, disregarded it, and now feel it was seriously under-emphasized."
3,great bag!,"I used this for a 2 week trip around europe in the summer. It was very useful, the bags detach and hence allow you to carry on on the plane. wished there were more side pockets, especially on the smaller bag.It served its purpose well for me though, but might be harder if traveling around europe in the winter as you might have to pack more."
2,"Plastic sheet ""internal frame"" crumbled","This backpack claims to have an ""internal frame"" which is actually a flimsy plastic sheet. I barely used the backpack, but after about six months the plastic frame started crumbling. All the plastic shards ended up in a pile at the bottom of the pack. I was forced to cut open a hole in the pack in order to remove all the pieces. The plastic was so soft that it continued to crumble as I handled it. I'd say this is pretty inexcusable.The overall design is decent and it looks good. However, I needed the frame for support, so I don't recommend it for hiking or heavy loads."
5,Great campy sci-fi fun from the 1940s,"I first read this book as a kid in the 70's - it was old and musty then, and seemed thick as a brick (paired with the sequel, After Worlds Collide). But it's a great story - a planet out of space is hurtling towards Earth, and there is no way to thwart it like we would have today. It is discovered that the 'new' planet will bump Earth out into the cold of space, and it will then take over the old Earth orbit. So a plan is hatched to launch a 'Jules Verne' style rocket ship to the new planet, and most of the story deals with the building and staffing of the ship before the 'big day' when Earth gets right-English into the side pocket. Great story - fun to read it all its dated glory. The sequel, After Worlds Collide, deals with the 'Adam and Eve' story on the new planet (convenient that the lead lady is called Eve in the story). Not as good as the first book, but still very fun to read. 5 out of 5 - highly recommended."
3,A wonderful but dated story,This has all the faults of early sci fi. Stereotype characters and uncomplicated relationships. It is a classic because of its ground breaking ideas. Science has finally established there are indeed wandering planets that could dangerously intersect solar systems. Kudos for getting this right. I enjoyed reading it for the plot and not the characters.
2,File cabinet,"The finished product looks lovely in my office. However, I had to assemble the entire piece from SCRATCH! For the price that I paid, I would expect the item to have been assembled, at least partly. Had I known it would take me 5 hours to put it together, I would not have purchased this item."
1,Do not buy this cabinet,"For what you pay for this file cabinet, you'd expect a good quality factory-assembled product. What you get is 4-5 hours of work putting the thing together, trying to interpret unlcear directions, and correcting for holes drilled in the wrong spots. This one ruined my day. I'd never purchase any Bush furniture again."
1,So out of date!,"I bought this map last month. I returned from Shanghai yesterday 4/23/07. This map was copyrighted 4/1/05 and I guess the April Fool's joke was on me. Virtually every site for shopping on this map has been torn down or moved or both. Nanjing Road is still there but the fabric market, the Sunday antique market, Xiangxin market have moved and some are too far west to show up on the map. Asking taxi drivers to take you to a walled off construction site confuses them. Some of the old sites have signs directing you to the new location, such as the fabric and clothing market, but for others, you need to consult the concierge at your hotel. This map should not be sold until it is updated. This is a complete ripoff."
5,great measures,this is a great product here. Dont fish a tourney without the Gator Golden Rule. Others are not as accurate.
4,ademademademademadema,"great band, with some awesome songs on this CD. however, their self-titled debut was a better CD overall. Best tracks: Unstable, co-dependant, blame me, stressing, blame me, and the best on the album: PROMISES. oh, and Kansas-dude; Dry Cell signed to Beyond Control Records back in like 2001 and recorded their debut ""Disconnected"". Then they got a deal from Warner Brothers in 2002 and ditched Beyond Control for them. After re-recording their album on the WB label, they released a few copies for radio stations, and actually i saw a new one of these selling for 4:50 on www.ebay.com the other day. DC recently decided they didn't like how much WB was changing their sound, and went back to Beyond Control. They are currently re-recording ""Disconnected"" for the 3rd time.By the way - they released a promo EP back in 2002 which can also be found on ebay.com, and also go to www.sirenrock.com for three non album DC tracks in MP3. later - slop"
4,Rock solid,"When I first heard these guys a few years ago, I was impressed with some of the songs. And with the lead singer being related to Jonathan Davis of KoRn, I thought it couldnt be bad.This is one solid rock album. Great energy; makes ya just want to crank up the volume and headbang. With the lead song ""Unstable"", and the rest of the line up of hard rock mixed with a few slower tunes, this album is definately a must have."
4,"Sounds like Adema, but is kinda soft","This album is great, but it is softer than the other album. I kinda like the soft sound. Don't always want to hear a bunch of screaming lyrics that you can barely understand. Excellent work Adema!"
5,Alot better than the ones before,they have improved alot..and have a harder and stronger rock. get this instead of limp bizkit. cool dvd. cool cd. good cd
5,Good band,"Great band with great songs in each of their albums. Wish they would release something new. Recommended cd, recommended band."
3,Lyrics need help,"I'll keep this short and sweet. There are quite a few catchy songs on this CD, but the lyrics will make you cringe. It's like listening to a 13 year-old complain about not having a girlfriend.But, while the music isn't groundbreaking, it's definitely not horrible either. A decent effort. Listen for yourself."
2,Not The Best Rock Album,"I'd have to agree with the one veiwer below. For an adult, he doesnt right that many mature songs. They are pretty childish. I have albums from Staind, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Korn, Trapt, Flaw, ect. and the albums I have are written from an adult perspective and you can hear that in there music but most of these songs are pretty basic. No suprise, no suspense. But I have to admit, some songs like ""Co-Dependent"" and ""So Fortunate"" are pretty catchy. Their best song on the album is probably ""Unstable"". But I think all-in-all the whole album is 40% good. I think they can do better. I'm out. Peace."
2,dissappointing,"this band has totally changed from their first album... there totally different and a lot softer... the only songs worth listening to are co-dependent, promises, so fortunate, and stressin' out... everything else is very repeatitive, very boring, and the lyrics SUCK... those songs that i mentioned are good though"
5,Honestly I didn't know what to expect...,Can anybody say spectacular? Musically I think this is one of the best cd's i've heard in awhile.. I'm actually surprised.
3,A new side of adema,"As a huge adema fan, I couldn't wait for unstable to be released. Now that I have listened to it, I am a little disappointed. After a hard hitting first cd, I was kind of hoping for more of the same, especially after hearing Immortal and shattered on the Insomniac's dream cd. I was optimistic that this cd would be more of that. And aside from Co-Dependent, Unstable, and Stressing Out, that was not the case. Don't get me wrong, all these songs are beautifully done and sound great. They are just a little too soft for my liking. I read somewhere that people were accusing adema of selling out, but they said they just want to show people their range of talent. And they did, they definately can cover all sides of the emotional spectrum. As a die hard fan, I recommend this cd to anyone. I just hope that for their third cd they revert back to their old ways."
4,Adema's Sophmore Album,"Personally, I loved Adema's first work (self-titled), and even the Insomniac's dream EP was good. This cd kind of turned away from the raw metal sounds that songs like Giving in, and Immortal (Insomniac's Dream) had. Don't get me wrong, this CD, is still metal, it's just kind of the more up beat metal sound that 'The way you Like it' had. Adema also seems to have found their slower, melodic side. They even have one song on this CD that sounds like they're experimenting with screamo. Overall, I'd say this CD is a good listen, but if you were hoping for the heavy, dark sounds of songs like Giving In, this isn't the CD you're looking for."
4,The Way You Like It,"If you ever wondered how Korn would sound if they tried something new and lyric's got even better then they already are. then wonder no more his brother in Adema has topped Davis Vocally and lyrically. This album isnt Korn or any other nu metal band. It's Adema and It's the way you like it. This album kicks off strong and holds you til Track 12. Sound wise Let Go is probably the most different. it truely shows that it's Adema maturity music wise and lryically. Songs of choice are Unstable, Stand Up, Let Go, & So Fornate. If you like Adema then support this band and buy this album."
1,sons of the new breed of nu-metal,"Back in 97 or 98 metal was in a great scene, all the bands that were comin out always brought something new. Nowadays it feels like no one wants to make real metal, its really sad to listen to these kinds of bands, nothing new, pure junk!. I have to admit that most of the bands that brought a new sound in that infamous second wave of numetal(system of a down, incubus, spineshank) now sound more like linkin park and limp bizkit. All you of should consider listening to real metal bands. Hail to Pantera, Sepultura, Snot, old Machine Head, DEvilDriver, Fear FActory RIP, Brujeria and Asesino, Superjoint Ritual, and the rest of the bands that really believe in what they do, they owe it to METAL."
2,The way you hate it,"It may vary, depending on how much you might have expected from the new release, or how much you dislike the modern pop-metal in general.The sad fact is Adema didn't move much forward since the debut album. Following the trends of the poppy heavier music, bringing nothing new and original, and finally having nothing as much memorable as The Way You Like It and Giving In from their first cd, Unstable is simply destinied to be more or less useless piece of plastic with a nice cover that would be appreciated by the die-hard fans of the band and the rest of the undemanding pop music lovers.The two stars are fairly deserved by Co-Dependent and Needles. The dvd is helpful as well, although the videos are rather as weak and average as the current songwriting talent of the boys."
2,An Honest Review,"I don't see how anyone could give this CD 5 stars. It had good melodies and hooks, but the lyrics were juvenile and just awful. I listened to it and thought ""This song sounds great, it's too bad the lyrics are almost laughable."" I dare anyone to tell me that ""Let Go"" isn't one of the worst professional songs you've ever heard."
4,Unfair Guys,I'm sorry to all of the hardcore Adema fans that slag off this album but come on this is ace! so much better than their self-titled album that they released a few years ago. musically adema have moved on lightyears and now they actually play music that is in time with each other an in the same key. i highly recommend this albumbest songs:Rip The Heart Out Of Me 10/10Co-Dependant 10/10Stand Up 9/10
2,A Cheap tent - you get what you pay for...,"I bought this tent for a one week trip. My good tents were all in storage in another city. By the end of the week, one of the door zippers was completely broken (can't be fixed without replacement), and that same zipper had ripped the tent fabric in more than one place.Rather than keep the tent as a spare, I threw it out after use. That ought to say it all."
2,low quality zippers and pegs,"I bought this one knowing that I shouldn't expect top quality from a tent this price, however after try it I'm rather disappointed. First, the six pegs included with the tent are too weak to stand against the slightest wind and I should forage for some wood sticks to fix the tent, so you better buy a separate set of heavier pegs before leaving for your first trip. Besides, the second time I set it up the main zipper for one of the doors broke down and I had to spend the rest of the day with this door open, mend it back at home and use just one door from then on (until it fails too I guess). Consider spending twice as much if you can and prefer to stay free from this headaches."
1,8 by 8 Foot Dome Tent,"because of too many missing pieces, we end up improvising....the rod is also broken..there's a hole in a mesh. bought the item a month before its going to be use and that's when i realized all these problems is during set up time. thought about returning but since its been used and putting it back together is a little tough.would never buy stuff from these company..."
3,Don't let it rain.,Got some good summer nights out of this one. Spent a couple rainy nights out on the Olympic rain forests glad I brought the big blue tarp.
3,"Great for a warm and dry weekend, but not for a cold and wet one","The tent itself was very spacious for two people. However I should have heeded the fine print on the box that said this tent was water ""resistant"". The water seemed to just come right through the material, rain-fly and all. There was very little ""resistance"" with this tent. If you are planning to buy this tent, I would suggest investing in a decent size tarp as well!"
5,cool,"set up tent in my backyard and so far it seems to be a good product... setup would not be easy for a beginner, but i know the tricks to get it up i like the dual exit/entrance doors in my mind so far, 100%"
4,camping,"The tent worked out perfectly for my wife and daughter on there girl scout camp out. She said that it was very easy to put up, and take down, and was alot bigger than we had thought."
5,Great tent on a budget,"I am not a tent maven. I got this to put in the backyard for extra guests, or for low intensity camping. Materials were strong & sufficient, and zippers & zipper stitching are well made. Assembley was similar to prior experience with dome tents; exception: the ends of the fiberglass rods do not fit in a fabric pouch. Rather, the ends have a hole, and each tent corner has a rotatable metal 2"" shaft that slides into the end of the fiberglass rod. More tension than previously needed with the fabric pouch must be kept on this metal shaft or it falls out of the fiberglass rod end. Having assembled by myself, the first rod took 5 minutes to get up (I was NOT going to ask the wife for help). The second one took 15 seconds. One person can easily get this up by themselves; two people would be easier (but show weakness)."
1,You Get What You Pay For I guess,"This tent set up easily and seemed like a good deal at first but our camping night was ruined when it was windy and cold and the zippers broke after only 4 or 5 uses - so we froze! Plus the poles broke and the stakes were cheap and bent easily...making our tent practically blow away in the wind. Overall the materials for this tent were really cheap and I ended up throwing it away after one use. I'd recommend spending more money for a higher quality tent, you get what you pay for I guess."
3,Not Recommended for Unusual Weather,"I took this tent with me to Burning Man 2007. There was a sandstorm.The seams of the tent ripped and the zippers jammed. If it wasn't for some baby pins, this tent would have been useless.The price is great, but think about a worst-case weather scenario when buying a tent."
3,A Magical Mystery Tour,"I went to a bit of effort to buy this novel after having read Meek's entertaining short story, ""Brown Pint of Courage"" in the Children of Albion Rovers collection. It sounded like a neat road trip book as this ex-student dude goes bopping around Europe with a madman and a cute woman in search of an antique egg some guy is paying him to retrieve. It's not all that funny though, and wanders off into phantasmagorical areas that left me scratching my head. Oh well."
2,Not as good as older units,"I have two older WaterPik shower heads which I love. I really like the misting function of the ones I have. They do fail after about 2 years - although I imagine folks with hard water would do worse. I have just gotten into routinely replacing. This time there were new models. The ""old"" misting mode is really a fine mist, almost fog. Individual droplets too small to see. The ""new"" one just sprays water small droplets over a 90 degree cone getting water up and over the shower curtain. For those who would know what I mean, the droplets are about a microliter. Gets the floor outside the shower wet. Not good.For me, this was a fatal flaw."
1,Weak,"Bought this to replace my 1988 Shower Massage head. What a mess. Good on full spray only. Massage settings are a joke, even with the restrictor removed. I am returning this thing immediately."
1,not high pressure,Got this after searching for high pressure shower head. That's probably the worst possible description one could offer. Most shower heads in 3rd world countries have more pressure.
4,does the job...,for the price if you have a small job you can not beat it. Used this for 7 old steam radiators and it worked great...you need to really watch your moisture though so make sure you have an inline filter to elimate any from your tank and keep you sand or shot in a very very dry and warm place...also keep in mind you need some real volume not just cfm...I have a job boss (porter cable) and it was a little lacking....used my brothers 30 gallon with less cfm but more volume and it was so much more efficiet to spray with. I think if you have realistic expectations you will like this unit. But if you have a big job or don't have a very good compressor then upgrade your compressor or hire out the work.
2,Not what was expected,"This is a gravity fed blaster and it does not work very well. I used medium slag abrasive and it did not feed into the hose very well. If you're looking for a blast pot, this is not what you are looking for.On the upside, I like the blaster handle. I use it for a bunch of stuff, but i threw the rest away."
5,Buffet and Jackson perfect duo!,"The editorial review is so off-base!""It's Five o'Clock Somewhere"" is a workingman's anthem. It's musical roots are certainly in Margaritaville. I'm not a parrothead, but Jimmy Buffet deserves better than that review. Alan Jackson is almost always wonderful to hear. Pair him with Buffet and you just can't help but crank up the volume, sing out loud and grin ear to ear. Do a whole album together guys!"
4,All around great cd,"What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't been said before? Just the fact that he is able to release a follow up to a greatest hits cd is a testament to his ability as a writer and singer. I don't necessarily like every track (Where Were You was pretty insipid, but then I'm not American) which is why I didn't give it 5 stars but it is certainly worth it's price. He goes from serious to laid-back showing that he isn't a stereotypical artist capable of singing only one type of song."
5,Alan Jackson's fruity album,If you love the fruity sounds of a yodelling country singer singing about his girlfriend and his broken heart then this is the album for you. Don't pass up the opportunity to sit back on the couch with your feet propped up on the coffee table and a beer in your hand while listening to Alan Jackson. I can't get enough of his fruity sounds.....
3,"Product great, company not so much","I ordered a 2-pack, but only received one. Upon contact with the company, nothing was done to get me the second one. So, I was charged for 2, but only given one without an explanation."
3,Tangerine Dream - 'Tournado' (Blueprint) 3 1/2 stars,"'Tournado' is a good,live later-day release by Tangerine Dream.Was recorded on April 23,1997 in Zabrze,Poland during the band's second set.You need to keep in mind that there is NO old/vintage material here whatsoever.All ten tracks appear to be from their '90's repertoire,which isn't so bad really.Well played electronic/new age.Line-up:Edgar Froese-mellotron&bass,his son;Jerome Froese-keyboards,Zlatke Perica-guitar and Emil Hachfeld-percussion.For serious Tangerine Dream fans only.Might appeal to some fans of Klaus Schulze,Vangelis,Agitation Free and Ash Ra Tempel."
2,Slow...,"Plot Summary: Tony wants to be a hitman for the Mafia, but first he has to learn from a master. Enter Stevie California-cool, eats veggie burgers and quotes Neitzche. Tony may not agree with Stevie's style, but he has to complete his training so he can go back and kill the Mafia's accountant, who's about to turn state's evidence. His final test: kill whoever is randomly picked out of the yellow pages. His target: Angel Chaste. Angel works the graveyard shift at a mortuary. She thinks a doll is her baby. Her mother left when she was little. Basically, Angel has PROBLEMS. When Tony, Angel and Stevie collide, it will change all of their lives.Reactions to the movie: The character and plot development was rather slow and the movie seemed to wander. The charactures, for example, Stevie California,seemed to be rather formulaic. (Let's piece these elements together and make a character out of them.)"
1,This is below Kyles acting levels,"This was so disappointing. When I see Chandler acting I usually enjoy him but in this movie, he is very disappointing and I find that this is a turkey movie or as they used to be called. I hope to see him in some good movies. The acting is so bad and for Jim Belushi, all the actors are very disappointing to watch. I expect great things from both of these actors and I did not get that with this movie."
5,A materpiece!,"This is film photography that is fully compatible with the digital age. It is not so much on what settings he used but on the planning and preparation that matters the most. What was in his mind when the shot was taken is fabulous. While he shoots landscapes mostly at the time when we are either calling it a day or still sleeping in the early morning, there are certain tips that opens our views on not only what, but also when and how to take a shot! This is a must have book for travellers wanting to have beautiful memories of his/her travel. We will never reproduce the same scene on a given place or event but it will surely open our eyes on what to look for and how to be a more creative photogpraher. I agree with Bob that when you know what to look for then you will realize how abundant there is to shoot wherever you are!! A must have book indeed! I give it 6 stars but unfortunately 5 is the best there is to choose from!"
5,Real Pro Reveals Valuable Techniques and Tips,"Bob Krist has opened his bag of tricks to reveal his time-tested techniques. Some pros are reluctant to discuss the nitty-gritty details of their methods. Krist gives straight forward, practical advise and tips that amateurs will find invaluable. While the publisher picked a vague, unclear title for the book, the advise inside is well worth the price."
4,THINKING METAPHORE,"This book shows clearly how reality cannot be readly separated from the way we represent it, notably from the links between different signs and metaphorical thinking we input about it."
2,Thought it was good...,"Well, i got this record a few months back and, at the time, i thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Cauterize, upon first listen, seem to be doing things differently than the average pop punk band gracing mtv. Their music is a bit edgier, less whiney and full of emotion. Well, make that feaux-motion. I mean, its probably very sincere but it really loses its ""umpf"" after about 4 or 5 thorough listens. Sure, i stil pop it in from time to time, but this one won't last too long."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"I have a bad habit. I buy CDs after only hearing one song from an artist. I bought ""So Far From Real"" after only hearing half of the song ""Something Beautiful"". It had a good sound and I was excited to hear more from them. Well I got exactly what I wanted, but be careful what you wish for. EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME! I'm sorry to say but it's the truth. And the swearing that's thrown in on ""Taste of Tears"" is just not needed. Don't get me wrong, Cauterize has a good sound, but it's the same few chords over and over again. But for 8 bucks, I don't regret buying it."
5,good cd,"i just got an email from tremor with a few bands in it. i sampled a few tracks, and thewy werent that good. then i heard cauterize. THEY ARE AWESOME! i highly recommend this cd!"
5,What i think is the best band of the 21st century!!!,i learned about Cauterize on 1080 Avalanche. their song Killing Me was the on the first level i played. then i heard Choke and tried to find all of their songs on the web. i found them and then i got a 25$ gift card to Amazon on Christmas 2005 and tried to get the CD. i entered my adress wrong...oops. o yea the guy who rated them 3-stars i think u were dropped on your head as a child
3,Buy what you want!,"I got this disc onlly cuz I heard a song I LOVED on it and thought that 10 bucks is an easy price to pay to get it. However, if your listening to all these other people complaining about this disc cuz they don't like the ""Customers also bought..."" listing, well shut them up. The list is only a list of what other PEOPLE choose to buy with this disc, not other artist/albums similar to it. READ WHAT YOUR LOOKING AT, if your buying this disc on a wim, STOP! It's a good disc, but listen to the samples and ask around before you put your money on the line, and if you don't like it THEN you have the right to complain. It's a good disc, and don't let these other people talk smack cuz they messed up... Make the choice on your own, it's music, buy what you like and know.Sorry if I'm being a little rude, but these guys are just annoying."
4,"please, spread the word","this is a very good punk band. if you're ever in the states, go to a music store, and buy it for a cheap price. i found in woodbridge for $27.99, and every other music place from markham and every where else didn't have it in stock. i went to the states, and bought it for $10. all of the tracks on it are just great, and the lyrics are original, with some things that i've never heard in songs before. really, spread the word about 'cauterize', because i learnt about this band from a friend, and i'll be telling all my friends about them. it really is an extraordinary album. please, spread the word!"
4,Way to go amazon.com. You're irresponsible.,"The list of ""customer's who enjoyed this CD also enjoy also enjoy blah blah blah"" is off dude. I'm talking WAY off. This is a punk band. Not at ALL an alternative band. More like The Get Up Kids + The Starting Line, or something along the lines of that. Not ""Smile Empty Trapt Soul Fly Cold Bizkit"". Shutup Amazon, you suck."
2,Yawn.,"This CD didn't do it for me. Granted they do have a few catchy songs recorded on this album, there is nothing original about it whatsoever. I found the lyrics boring and repetitive at times, which happens frequently with copy and paste style ""emo"" (pop) groups like Cauterize. The problem is that the singer (even though he definitely can sing) can't pull off the somewhat tame lyrics with any sort of real EMOtion or conviction. Worth a listen? For sure. Worth two listens? Definitely not."
2,Not Real Outlaw Choppers,"Yet another coffee table picture book on the current styling trends of Choppers. Mr. Seate's excellent previous book, 'Choppers' touched on the origin of these great machines and then went on to showcase the current trends. Instead of this new book delving deeper into actual hand built outlaw machines from the glory days of the late 60's and 70's and the home built bikes of today, it also focuses on modern, big dollar builders. Some of the bikes featured such as the BMC bikes may be nice machines but they are production bikes and shouldn't be included here. The Bobber section does have some nice rides and Chica's stuff is pretty cool but you can find bikes like these in any current Harley biased custom magazine. The title suggests that you're going to see real outlaw choppers but this is just another attempt at cashing in on the current TV driven fad. Real chopper fans may be dissapointed."
3,"Have to agree with the third review,","BUT, there's always that isn't it. A pretty good book all in all. Well worth buying USED. While I'm not a big fan of late model styles, a few interesting ideas on a couple of the scoots. Just two real nice old-style bobbers, a pan and the big flathead on the back cover. Nice color pictures. Kinda interesting reading too, if you're into that sort of thing."
3,Almost there,"I admire what Glover was trying to do with this book, but it just didn't quite work for me. His tale of a high-spirited, young French woman marooned off the coast of Québec sounded very promising, yet did not live up to my expectations.Glover's characters are strongly developed, but he throws them into a meandering plot that is difficult to follow, and not all that interesting. While the conflicts encounterd by the female lead are difficult, and should be inspiring, her solutions and reactions provide little entertainment. The 'racy' sexual encounters of the title character add little to the actual story."
3,Worked OK but eventually failed...,"I bought this for a plumbing project involving a something shy of 2-dozen 4-band no-hub couplings. Initially, it seemed to work OK, but towards the end of the project I striped a number of the pipe clamps on the couplings and figured out that it was no longer calibrated to 60 in-lbs. I ended up ruining 5 couplings, and finished off the project with a dial indicator torque wrench. A bit disappointed this tool didn't maintain calibration but in its defense it was laying around a pretty dusty construction environment; I could have done a better job of storing it in a clean tool box when I wasn't using it."
5,Affordable & Comfortable,"As a track beginner, I did not intend to spend a lot for my first serious ""track-shoe"". I was looking for something I could afford. I ran into the ASICS Men's Hyperdistance shoe on Amazon.com. The cool looks were indeed enticing, and it seemed perfectly within my price range. I went on and bought it.Its the best I could have asked for the money I spent. Comfortable and really well cushoned, you feel like you are stepping on cotton--seriously. It is really light which allows me to use it for both long and short races.A wonderful buy overall. Highly recommended for both the beginner and pro alike."
3,"Nice, but not great","It seems to keep the meanings well, but I was a bit disappointed when I found out it was based on the King James Version. I was hoping for something a bit more modern poetic rather than ye Olde English."
5,Crane Spreads Wings is one hilarious misadventure!,"From the very beginning of the book, you have to wonder if the main character, Jane Croy, a.k.a. Effie Crackalbee, is ""all there."" For starters, she leaves her newlywed husband because he's not exactly all he's claimed to be. Well, who is, right? But once she leaves him, she launches into a (mis)adventure that gets more preposterous with every turn. As I continued reading, I fell in love with all the zany characters and with Susan Trott. The story reads like a daytime drama & sitcom all-in-one. I highly recommend anyone who needs a good belly laugh to sit down for a few hours with Crane Spreads Wings."
1,Awful Printing!,"I will perhaps update this review later to reflect the content of the book, but I first want to state that the typesetting and the physical printing in this text is HORRIBLE. It looks like someone literally made this book by taking blank paper and photocopying an existing edition of the book into this one. There are black lines, shadows, 'ghosts' from page corners and all sorts of horrible markings on nearly all the pages. It looks like a bootleg or something, honestly.I love the content so far and the book is no disappointment there, especially for the seasoned programmer looking to stump themselves on some difficult trivia. This issue with the printing though, it detracts from the whole thing. Such a shame, because I really wanted to like this book."
3,"The Kentucky Derby, Rose for the Roses","Nice book, beautiful color pictures. everything you'd want to know about the Kentucky Derby."
1,To Haute for me,"I have lived in and have travelled to Maine for over 40 years and have a pretty good idea of both the local restaurant scene and the new commers. However, in a travel format I think the book should have focused more on the wonderful Seafood, Lobster Pounds and Clam shacks dotting the Maine coast. Yes they have some but give too much space to new wave cooking. If you are going to visit Maine I think you want the flavors of Maine, not spaqgheti alla carbonara.This book missed the mark and excluded several of Main's best well known Lobster Pounds and Clam Shacks."
3,Coverage limited to the coast only; usually no comment on how the food tastes,"The subtitle does say ""on the Coast,"" so it's not misleading per se, but you won't see Augusta, Bangor, Auburn. The information contains quite a bit of what is on the menu and the cost, and notes decor and staff, but has very little about how the food tastes. It's almost as if many times the writer sent someone in to look at the place, get a menu, and talk to some people without ever having eaten there. The book is very good for narrowing your choices in places to eat, but usually doesn't give subjective information that I would expect from a professional food reviewer."
4,Plano Large Tackle Box (6 tray),"This tackle box will meet most all tackle storage needs. It is larger than most but meets the old adage ""when you need it, you will have it."""
3,Fabulous quick read helps explain the roots of the Holocaust,Must read for anyone who wants to understand the factors that produced the Holocaust. Also gives a chilling verdict against the American medical community because of its support for euthanasia.
3,Good overview but..........,"I must admit I enjoyed reading this book when I first obtained it, but upon revisiting it my opinion has somewhat waned. The reason being is that I have since read Peter Hofschroer's work which was an excellent example of painstaking research and detail. Chandler's work now seems lightweight.Chandler's book is good if you are looking for an overview of the events leading up Waterloo, Napoleonic tactics and strategy and the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo. The book makes lavish use of maps and prints which are very clear and a delight to the eye , but unfortunately it falls short in providing a very accurate and detailed account of the battles.This is certainly a good buy if all you are seeking is an overview, but if you are familiar with the Battle of Waterloo you maybe looking for something more substantial. ( This review refers to a hard cover 1981 edition )"
4,An introduction to Waterloo for beginners,"I rate this book highly because it does its job, which is an introduction and background to the Battle of Waterloo for people who are new to this part of history and might want a good general background and understanding without going too deeply into the area. Very easy to read with lots of pictures. Don't expect a big heavy tome though, it really is a beginner's guide and a good one too. A very good starting point and easily digested. The only criticism I had was that the illustrations don't include the date, so a picture in the book is often not contemporary at all but painted decades after the Battle. There are many contemporary illustrations but many aren't and it is impossible to tell as dates aren't given. Since often contemporary pictures and illustrations tell us much, I found it bad historical practice that dates weren't given. However, a good starting point for the novice researcher."
1,Significant errors abound,"How can anyone supposedly study a subject for so long and make so many errors? Chandler's WATERLOO contains so many factual campaign/battle and army organizational errors that a 1,000 word review cannot begin to get into the description of all the mistakes. As a result, the book is of extremely questionable value."
5,awsome vest,this vest is the nicest airsoft vest i have ever seen. it holds everything you need and there is a really good sholder protecter on the right shoulder for carring your riffle . it is definatly worth the buy on other sites this vest costs about 70 bucks.i would recomend buying it on here
4,Decent vest,"This vest is good for hard core airsoft, it really serves not purpose for the back yard airsoft wars. also don't buy this vest if you do not have any spare clips for your guns, then your aisoft vest doens't hold anything and it only works for padding. but now some positives, this vest is comfortable and hold all the ammo you need. Over all its a good vest. 8/10"
2,Bland short term fix,"His information is interesting and I thought, ""I can do anything for 6 days"" but I was wrong. The food is just the pits. No oil or even spray allowed for cooking and lots of luck finding no-sodium dijon mustard. You eat very bland salad for almost every meal.I'm going to try his suggestions for exercise but switch over to another food plan."
4,It works!,"In depth knowledge about health and a way of life. Meal preparation was tedious, but well worth it. I lost 7 lbs. in 6 days and increased my energy 10 fold. It is best to really sit down and take it seriously and prepare, you won't regret it."
3,24/7 Food,"I did the diet for over 6 days to help kick start my metabolism. I felt like every minute of every day, evolved around eating or preparing food or cleaning up after. I know 6 small meals each day is the proper way to boost your metabolism but I could say for 6 days you can do anything. I lost 10 lbs but I have a feeling it was mostly water weight because, I didn't realize at the time, but my diet was high in salt. If anything the book helps you disect your usual diet and make the proper changes for your body. It is worth a few bucks but I wouldn't get the huge $100 infomercial kit. It is too hard to follow for life!"
2,Confused ?,"I originally purchased this book as my daughter wanted to buy the 6 week makeover package for $300.00. I thought that if the 6 day makeover worked, then we would continue with the 6 week package. On purchasing the book, we had to decided our body types - totally confusing !!!! Neither my daughter nor myself could decide what body types we were - the one I chose was to eat meat 4 times a day - I am almost a vegetarian !!!I am glad that I purchased the book, but found that the body typing was not consistent- too many choices, that lead to different diets."
4,loosing weight,"The book gave alot of usefull imformation, so far I've lost 25 lbs ,recommend to any one with extra weight to loose fast without being hungry. But you must like greens"
2,Ok book but nothing too new or ground breaking.,Book not very quick read. Didn't really like the tone of the author. It felt condescending to me. I didn't even finish reading it.
2,Nearly starved!,"This programs promises you will eat more and exercise less. NOT TRUE! For my body type, the diet is basically chicken, tuna and salad all the time every day 7 days a week. And not only do you have resistance exercises to do two days of every week, they also recommend that you do an hour of aerobic exercise 6 days a week. That doesn't sound like more or less of anything to me. The fact is, I couldn't stay on the diet. After 3 days I was sick to death of chicken and salad. And the fact is--if you exercise 6 days a week for an hour, it doesn't matter what you eat--you're going to lose some weight. Too expensive a program. You can get the same info. on the internet for free. It's also too hard for some people to figure their body type with this program. I answered all the questions and could have come under two body types, but it gives you no information about which diet to follow if you fit two profiles."
3,Not for those who need to lose a lot of weight,"It's my understanding from others on the 6-week body makeover that the 6-day makeover is not recommended until you have gotten used to the program. I think the 6-day makeover is great for those who aren't severely overweight, but if you are like me and need to lose a significant amount of weight, skip the book and get the full program. By the way, the 6-day body makeover book does contain numerous references and promos for the more expensive 6-week makeover plan."
4,Pleased,"The book was easy to read and if you follow the instructions you can lose weight. But it is very hard to stick to it. Enjoyed the recipes even if they were a pain to prepare but it is the only way to make this diet work. Could not make it a life style tho, only a quick and temporary fix."
3,5 day Body Makeover,Your service was great!!!!I've ordered from Amazon before and will continue to do so. Thank you. I will order again as the need arises. The book was not what I had expected but interesing to read
2,6 Day Body Make Over,"This may indeed work, but it does take some planning and some work to organize the food. The book lays things out very clearly for you, though, so if you are sincere and have the time, great purchase. My friend lost 8 pounds in the first week and felt great."
1,Starvation diet,"I tried this program based on the fabulous reviews. I lasted four and a half days and was so happy to finally be able to eat a variety of food again. I was HUNGRY, tired, headachy, and couldn't sleep. I can't believe how many people say they ate 'so much food' and felt great. On the second day I figured the calories and it was only 850-970 per day (depending on if extra is eaten before exercising). And the meals are the same every single day. Boring and monotonous.I followed the program to the letter and after four and a half my clothes still fit the same.Check out Tosca Reno's ""The Eating Clean Diet."" Much more food and variety and I feel great after only the first day!"
5,works!,"It is hard to stick to,but def worth it! I lost 7 lbs in 6 days (I only need to lose 25). I feel great, my skin cleared up, more energy... My friend lost over 100 on his longer plan in one year. Cook ahead, and plan ahead or it can be very tempting to cheat!"
2,Starvation,"Basically, this book tells you to cut out all salts, sugars and fat, eat very small portions, and excercise moderately. The author goes so far as to tell the reader not to participate in strenuous exercise like weight-lifting, elliptical machines and martial arts. This is because the diets are so spartan you won't have much energy to workout.This is a horrible idea: starve yourself, and then gain all the weight back when you go off the diet. Avoid this one."
1,Just save your money,"I will say I have not tried this diet so I can not speak about the success or failure of it - it might work. Any diet would work that requires you to eat no salt, no suger, no fat and drink 100 oz of water a day. My plan was to basically eat meat and fruit or ""greens"" 5 times a day. Sorry to say - I couldn't imagine choking this down for a week. Each plan for your body type is different but do not vary too much from the one I described. It is an interesting concept, but I have had more success with South Beach - a diet that provides much more variety."
5,Works like a charm,"When I started the Michael Thurmond 6 day diet 6 months ago it was my last attempt at a diet program to lose weight before my wedding. I was 5""2 and at 165 lbs. After the first six days I had lost an amazing 10 lbs. It is important to note though that I prepared and followed the program suggestions 100% and read the entire book. After the six days I slowly started adding carb, protein, and fruit servings as Michael instructed for my body type and continued to lose weight slowly. Now after finishing the diet a second time (wait at least 2 months before re-attempting) I am down to 140 and feel fantastic. This program laid out a blueprint that has made it easy for me to transition into a lifestyle of healthy eating and I know now I will look and feel beautiful at my wedding. I have even passed this program onto my fiance and his father who have both lost an amazing 20 lbs each!"
3,Betta Fish tank,"Definitely run this for a day or so in the tank before you put your fish back in because it turns the water almost black with all the black carbon it puts out. The extra carbon didn't harm my fish at all but it didn't seem healthy. I think for the price they could include an air pump with the filter but nevertheless it plugs away and works pretty good at keeping my fish water less cloudy and not disturbing my male betta. My recommendation is to buy a fish tank that includes a filter, it will be much cheaper and fit your tank better since this filter pops out of the top of my tank."
4,Biography of China Missionary,"This book is a great read. It is a great encouragement to any one of any faith. Gladys' story is pure inspiration to the way we live. She faced many harsh circumstances, and through relying on her Lord and simply pushing on, she made it through some of, probably, China's hardest years.The way in which this book was written seemed to be so that any one would be able to read it easily. It would be great for any child from grade 4 and up. It is easy to understand, and it is truly and adventure story.Although there are some typos, it doesn't affect the overall story. It is most definitely a great find for any one, and I challenge you to pick this one up some time. It will be a challenge to put it down."
3,The perfect boot except for the sole,"I bought a pair of the 500 blunstones about 2-3 yrs ago. I've loved them - they are really comfortable, look well, nice leather uppers. Unfortunately this year on pulling them out of storage for winter the soles were cracking and falling off. The cobbler I brought them to said this is a common problem unless they are worn all the time - they dry out in storage and then crack. Also they cannot be fixed as they are completely rubber - there is nothing to stitch/glue a new sole onto.:(Sadly I probably won't be buying them again unless this problem is fixed."
5,Simply the best!,"I have the Blundstone Chunk boot in black. I have worn them in thunderstorms, puddles, rain, snow, mud and hail. These babies are warm and waterproof. And salt stains just wipe right off. I cannot imagine a Canadian winter without them! This winter I have worn them everyday they are sooo comfortable! No complaints!"
5,Great play.,"I saw this play the summer of 1998 in Chicago. I found it to be a moving experience. It can currently be found in print in the anthology ""Victory Gardens Theater Presents: Seven New Plays from the Playwrights Ensemble"" available through Amazon. A wonderful book filled with some of the best new plays in America. The Tony Award winning Victory Gardens Theater is dedicated to producing new works and bringing new voices to the stage."
1,Did they consult any fishermen when they designed this box?,"Spinnerbaits and large plugs do not fit in the flip-side compartment. In fact, spinnerbaits do not fit anywhere unless you want to throw them in a big jumble in the side zippered pockets.I do like the beefy strap which makes a fully loaded box a breeze to carry. That's the only reason I gave this box a star. In terms of versatility and ability to hold lures, it's a terrible design.Thank goodness for return policies."
1,Not Salt Water Friendly,I was excited when I found this tackle box even though I had yet to purchase any tackle. It sat in the original plastic packing on my flying bridge for several months before I aquired some tackle to store in it. To my dismay when I went to load it every zipper had corroded and broke off when I went to pull on them. Every piece of metal was rusted and corroded. The nylon was fine and the straps were OK but the pockets were unuseable because I can't open or close them. Plano should state on the packing or the tag that this item is not meant to be near a sea water environment. Now I am out the $65 I paid for it and still have to get a new tackle box.
4,Why you should read this.,It is a great book. Christopher tells the story of this one. He falls in love with the fairy princess. He gets harmed by one of Senna troops. Something bad happens to Senna finally. I'm addicted to this series.
1,magisen,this book is about some kids how get traped in a fantiy world. the main carter is christopher. this book is where some kids that think ther home but not and a magisen named mrlin is trying to cacht them. then chistopher falls in love whit a which and dos not want to leav her. and the climax is the where mrlin kills a gint.i like this book a lot.
4,B+,"This book is a great choice for young kids that want to become a firefighter, it teaches them that firefighters are great people to look up to and you can become whatever you set out to do. This book also teaches young readers that firefighters not only fight fires but also do many other good things for the community, such as get kitties out of trees and respond to medical calls. I am 10 and i liked this book, it was enjoyable i rate it 4 stars."
1,Same old tired arguments. Debunked long ago. Dishonest. Sad.,"I have never written a review where my title was probably all that was necessary to describe the book. Yes, there are many books written by Young Earth Creationists who have no understanding of the science and even less knowledge of the scriptures. But this book manages to cram so little factual information into some 1300+ pages of weak quote-mining and even poorer reading comprehension on the part of the author--and I can scarcely describe the sadness I feel that we as Christ-followers are being judged by such poor quality material.Of course, one should rarely expect top quality material when there is no peer-review and a work is self-published."
1,Same old creationist hogwash...,"I really wish creationists would at least have the intellectual vigor to come up with something new. Even if you exclude the usual misquotes and other dishonest arguments, Ferrell's book contains absolutely nothing that hasn't long ago been refuted by mainstream science. Frankly, I found the book to be a sad, pathetic diatribe that seems to have ignored the advances of 20th century science, let alone the discoveries of the 21st century. Even worse, books like this only make Christians look foolish in the eyes of rational people and are a big part of why a majority of young people today reject Christianity as a backwards, crackpot religion run by people who refuse to accept modern science. Ferrell's book isn't just bad, it only hurts the cause of the very people it is aimed at."
1,A good look into the insanity of creationist thinking.,"Let the reader be warned that Vance Ferrell is no scientist or doctor and yet he writes books on placebo medicine.He does not even attempt to handle evolution according to a scientific standard or method. He writes off evolution as a religion and creationism as science when in reality creationism is clearly religion.Ferrell does not once address evolution in a scientific matter but merely applies a tactic of flooding the reader with so many questions (which he does not answer by the way), lost quotes and garbage the whole matter is laughable. The only reason one should buy this book is to look into the insanity of a creationist that is grasping at straws."
5,Great mat,"The mat size is great. My baby has plenty of space to lay, roll over and when the time comes, crawl! It's also nice that the mat is washable."
4,A new twist.,"The story of the rat who was changed into a boy to go with Cinderella's coach. He got to playing with the other Palace page boys and never made it back to the coach, so he has remained a boy. But he still acts like a rat at times.The newpaper hype blows the whole issue of a rat/boy into a media frenzy before the story ends.Fun reading."
3,A Good Book,In this book an old couple stumbles across a little boy.He says he was a rat so they take him all over town and try to find his owners.When they can't they decide to keep him.He runs away and gets into alot of trouble.But once again he is saved from death and reunited with his family.With the help of a young princess and a pair of scarlet slippers.I would recomend this book.
3,Could have been better,"I chose the book ""I WAS A Rat"", because when i was looking through the book shelf it cought my eye. The colors and the pictures were the best part about it. The story was too childish for some one my age(13). I do think that a child between the ages of 5-7 would find it more interesting. More details would have olso helped. Like where and when this story took place."
3,Cute but not Worth The Moola,"A very cute story, but hardly worth $15.95 in hardcover. I think Mr. Pullman and his publisher are cashing in big time on his name. I am a huge fan of retellings of famous myths and stories (Wicked; Confesssions of an Ugly Stepsister; Mysts of Avalon), but this is very, very lightweight.Don't get me wrong. It's a lovely little story. But little it is. If they republish this as a $4.99 paperback, definitely pick it up."
4,"A light, fun read","A shabby looking boy knocks on the door of an old couple, and insists he was a rat. The boy certainly has some rat like tendencies, such as drinking out of his bowl and chewing on his pillow. They decide to keep the boy (who they have named Roger) but he escapes and joins a freakshow. Roger makes it back to his adoptive parents after many comical adventures. A quick, funny fantasy read that will intrigue many readers."
4,awesome,"""I Was A Rat"" is about a boy who finds a couple to live with and insists he is a rat. But soon he causes tons of comotion in his home town new york. Hes really not sure who he is and then finds out he really is not a rat and ends up getting a big surprise.""I Was A Rat"" was an awesome book because....It taught me to always believe in my heart. But some times it can cause catastrophies. I really loved everything about this book!It was funny,sad and surprising. I think anybody who reads this book is sure to love it.Well at least I did! If i could give this book a ten I would. Sarah"
4,I loved this book!,"This is a very good book for all ages. A touching, memorable and yet a funny book. It pokes gentle fun at royal families and cruel circus owners. This is one of the favorite books I read and I absolutely loved it. It's a memorable book from a sewer to an exhausting life to a heartwarming family. You'll LOVE it, trust me!"
4,great shag album,"For all of the thousands of southeastern beach music fans, let me say that Mr. Welsh at least knows how to cut and paste his review."
2,Not the part pictured,I was looking for the composite style OEM part that is pictured what I got is a steel part. Sure it works but I already replaced them with steel once before and they didnt last. I hate when they dont ship whats pictured.
4,"Ah, nostalgia...","Recipe for creating a successful adult with a healthy ability for recognizing the humor, absurdity, and delicious mystery of life:Ingredients:1 The Big Joke Game1 The Westing Game1 Lizard Musicn Issues of Classic Mad Magazine (pre corporate-influence)Directions:1) Read2) Repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...."
5,Great Book,"Excellent book. I expected an ""Idiots Guide"" to be too elementary but it is a great book for everyone interested in the breed!"
5,Great Read...,"The Tim Tebow of Catholic Apologetics... Good read, and coming from a Protestant background myself, I can relate with Tim on a lot of stuff... Tolle Legge Brethren..."
4,I am pleased with the book,My rating would have been Very Good not Like New as advertised - but I am pleased with the book.
4,"Best of the ""PPP"" series","This inspired and creative work is very listenable. It spans from acoustic instrumentals to intriguing electronic moods, to vocal pop. Mostly it's instrumental, and introspective, but never disappointing. If you liked Geese and the Ghost and Wise After the Event, you will probably want this and PPP II."
1,not received 27.11.12,I placed this order 11th September and paid same day.order was estimated to arrive 15.11.12 have not received 27.11.12
2,Buyer beware: video is NOT anamorphic widescreen.,"This show, like season 2, was shot in widescreen format.If you watch this on a standard 4:3 television, everything will be alright. The image will be letterboxed.But if you're watching this on a 16:9 widescreen, guess what? You get to watch it ""windowboxed"", meaning black bars will be on all four sides. The studio who released this screwed it up royally. How could this happen? After all this time, you'd think botching video presentation like this would be a thing of the past, but obviously it is not. It's a shame because this is such a good series.I'm giving it 2 stars because it is still watchable; if you play it back on a screen 50"" or larger you probably can overlook the non-anamorphic picture. You could zoom it out using your screen controls on your television to fill the screen, but it will look pretty bad. You've been warned."
5,MY DOGS LOVE HIM.,"I now have 1.2.3.both 4s. and 5, I think he is gr eat, and America and the dog world is lossing a great leader in dog management. PLEASE i WOULD LIKE THE NEXT SERIES, 6/7/8/ AND 9 WHEN ARE THEY AVAILABLE?"
1,Quality is a real issue with this seat cover.,"The picture of this seat cover for your Toyota Truck, or bench seat in your truck looks nice. However, the quality is the lowest grade China manufacturing. The mesh material that is on the head rests, base, and back of the cover is very, very thin. This will strech out within days, and probably rip. There are straps that are used to fasten this cover to try to keep it snug to your seat, again, barely sewn on to the seat covers with a few threads and will rip if you try to tighten them to any degree. They don't fit properly along the driver and passanger headrests. The price is right if they worked, but they really don't function as true seat covers due to the weak China craftmanship."
1,Not worth the money,2 straps broke during installation. The cover has been on for 3 weeks now and is already shredding where the extremely cheap stretch material meets the heavy duty material. I would never buy this item again. The straps are flimsy and barely attached. The whole thing is a waste.
2,Cheap but works,"This is very cheap but there isn't anything else out there besides ""custom"" covers that run a couple hundred bucks! $30 isn't the greatest price point but better than the custom cost."
3,Truck Seat Cover,"The straps on the seat cover are not very sturdy, they all broke when trying to install. I am still using the cover however because it would be a hassle to return it. The bottom stays in place because of the child seats we have installed, but I don't know that I would recommend the product."
3,ok but not great,They cover the seat but the part that covers the bench is stretched out of shape in the back and didn't cover the the whole seat. The back fits great. But you get what you pay for.
1,don't buy this,"This is a great book, but don't buy this edition. It is terrible. The organization is terrible, the print is microscopic, and there are usually one or more gross typos on every page. It is a complete sham of an edition--the worst I've seen in memory, an embarrassment. Buy this book, but get another edition; you'll be glad you did!"
4,"Great, but not great enough","This is the epitome of what a futuristic jazz sound would be. The rhythms are all great and as some of the reviews have stated, the tunes have a very hypnotic quality. The only thing missing is that quality of melody that moves the soul and keeps you coming back to the disk. However, the movements and loops are driving and it deserves about as close to 5 stars as you can get."
3,Early Bluetech,I came to this after encountering his later work which builds on this and adds new layers of complexity and texture. Definitely worth a listen.
2,Good but....,"Great CD's from this artist. But super lame live as a DJ. I don't know if fame and fortune has softened this artist, but the performance in Santa Cruz was lame, sad and tired. If you are going to assemble a village to party, at LEAST bring some spontaneity and creativity to a DJ set. It is no longer acceptable to pose as an artist, pierce your earlobes and just press play on yer little mac book. I want my money and time back. What a YAWNER. I'm older and have seen thousands of live music shows and many DJ's, at BM etc., but I'm beginning to see DJ's as con men, charging for shows where their only job is too look hip and act the part. You gotta bring something to the table, in my book, like spontaneity and creativity but the current generation seems to content to consume lameness."
4,Intriguing,"Duffy wakes up in the hospital late one night to the sounds of desperate cries for help. All her friends tell her she was delirious, but Duffy isn't convinced. They sounded so real. Was she the only witness to a cruel crime? Somebody is out to get her, with dangerous and deadly pranks, but Duffy is helpless, bedridden because of her illness. Can she save herself from the vicious attacks?"
2,Fever Kills,"This book has an excellent setting in a really eirry hospital, but it lacks mystry. Nothing makes you want to turn the page as you just feel like you don't really care who's out to get Duffy."
4,New Edition of An Old Favorite,"Although the page numbers don't match the old edition, you can use them together at a Seder. Some of the changes are interesting."
4,Easy to Use Haggadah,"An easy to use Haggadah which should please just about everybody: people who like Hebrew, those who don't and those who need explanation."
4,Good book,It has a lot of good information but I was looking for something even simpler. Perhaps I'll buy the #1 Book.
4,nice spray that also meets food handling standards,this is a great smellin' spray that meets food handling standards. we have an all natural restaurant with no bleech or nasty chemicals.
5,I Love My Honeysuckle Home!,"I love this scent and I'm afraid it's being discontinued as it's getting hard to find.And I JUST discovered it! It's sweet but not overpowering. Clean and crisp as areall Meyers products. It deals nicely with pup accidents on my tile floor.No leftover puppy piddle smell. No lingering too sweetness. Just very niceclean, fresh, light flower scent. I so hope they keep making it! :O)"
3,Strong Counter top spray,This spray has a good cleaning power but a very strong cloying lavender scent. So if you dont like lavender its not for you. Also it's a pretty small bottle so it goes pretty quickly.
4,Strong smell and streak free,"I use this spray on my black kitchen counter which can get oily from my Foreman grill. The smell is a bit strong for me but its pleasant. Occasionally I will have to use a second layer of spray for harder spills but overall the cleaning ability is okay. Best thing about this spray is that is really is streak free. I will buy again, just not in lavender."
3,Edited Versions,"If you are expecting the full length versions of El Coco songs we were used to hearing in the mid to late 70's, then this may not be for you. I was happy to hear that distinctive El Coco sound again, but was VERY disappointed in the lengths of these songs. Most of the songs on this disk are in the 3:00 to 4:00 minute range. The song I was really excited about (Just Be You), was only 3:13, which was a major let down. It would be awesome if someone would release a collection of El Coco extended 12"" singles from back in the day (Just Be You, Let's Get It Together, Cocomotion, etc.). The overall quality of the music on the disk is excellent in my opinion, but the premium price for this disk makes it not really worth it."
3,He was big... and strong... and all man...,"""He was a man now, with a grown man's passions, and the kind of trouble that only a woman could cause."" So says the cover of Jack Sheridan's Fire in the Flesh. The man in question is a fellow by the name of Troy Bannock, nineteen years old, and like most boys his age, with sex on the brain. Troy ends up sleeping with a woman who has a very possessive, jealous boyfriend. Big mistake. Problems. You know the deal.The plot of this book is fairly standard stuff, not much one can say about it really. Sheridan's writing does flow quite nicely, though, I'll give him that. Nice vocabulary, great descriptive powers, too. When you've read enough old, forgotten paperbacks, you'll know how subpar the writing can be-- justly forgotten stuff, much of it. So the verdict is... an average book that was nonetheless quite pleasant to read due to the author's language mastery."
2,Chicco Radio Control Jeep,"Got this because I saw it for sale on HSN. It looked easy to control and seemed to have good range on tv, so I ordered it. Well, they must have been using a different car than the car we received. This car is very cute, and the kids instantly wanted to play with it, it seems fairly durable, but you have to stand basically within 3-5 feet of it to make it go, so the kids have to follow it around to make it drive, lame. the batteries die very quickly. And the general controls aren't that great. I got this as a Christmas gift for my son and was pretty disappointed. Over all, they don't play with it much because it's hard to control and they have to follow it all around, which sort of defeats the purpose of a remote control car. Would not recommend."
1,Great Sound!,"I herd the band in LA and bought the CD. Either way, the band rocks. They might make it famous someday when they find someone who can sing better then that big headed ragmop that they have now."
2,Not a regular Mona Simpson novel.,Mona Simpson's spare writing style was often confusing. I couldn't keep the characters straight and had to reread passages. I struggled about a third of the way through and finally gave up when my mind began to wander. There's too many good novels on my reading stack to waste time on this one. Too bad. I liked Anywhere But Here.
1,An Irregular Girl,"Reading this book felt like some sort of punishment I inflicted upon myself. I kept on reading, waiting for it to turn into a real story, worthy of the beautiful but empty prose within. I get the Owens/Jobs connection - I worked for Jobs for some years, I get it. However, it read like knowledge uninformed by insight, compassion, objectivity - only opportunism. And perhaps betrayal - does Simpson feel somehow she was entitled to share his life, his oddities? Clearly she does, or did. I'd say that at least at the time it was written, Simpson had some of her own personal issues to work out about her birth, her relationships, her perceptions of women. How would she feel if someone inflicted such a roman a clef on her?I don't blame Lisa Jobs for being pissed."
1,Don't waste your money,"Cursor is hard to find, movement keys are liable to send the cursor anywhere but where you pressed and then it hides behind the markers showing permanent numbers. Has a marker function for possible numbers but you can't delete them the way the manual says. All in all, very frustrating to play. Boxed up & returned."
4,Detailed Map,"The map is highly detailed and for drivers it is the best available. I was somewhat disappointed that rail lines and stations are so faintly indicated, as I am planning to travel by train and hiking paths in Northern England, not by car. But considering that the publisher is a tire manufacturer, this goes with the territory. Just keep in mind that this is definitely a driver's map."
5,"As usual, a good map from Michelin","This is exactly what I ordered-a map of Northern England and the Midlands. As usual, Michelin and Amazon delivered."
3,It could be so good...,"Enjoyable operetta and strong cast fortunately are not completely ruined by clueless director (who also ""edited"" pretty good original script so it lost any logic in its development)."
3,Jarring modern costumes,"While the singing is excellent and this operetta is loaded with marvelous tunes, I found the lack of period costumes jarring. I had last seen this production in a little jewel of a theater in Salzburg, and what a difference!Nonetheless, I would recommend this DVD until something more authenic comes along. Sound and video are both excellent."
4,Graf von Luxemburg,"Enjoyably campy, an updated version of Lehar's operetta. Music is excellent, staging on circular stage is amusing, the last act getting its inspiration from Marx Bros. Excellent singing overall, especially by the minor characters. Bo Skovhus struggling a bit. Good for a smile and some laughs."
3,About product quality and the opereta performing,"The DVD disc and its case arrived in very good condition sooner than time expected. The video recording is very good, but the audio at the beginning sounds a bit far (low) for the Count Danilo when his first appearance.I very much liked the voice of the soprano Juliane Banse, with very easy and powerful acutes, besides of her beautiful sound of voice. Also the comic tenor and soprano have a nice voice. The baritone Bo Skovhus sings well enough for this opereta, he has a good voice indeed, but perhaps he could sing a bit more 'legato' instead of 'speaking' in the first duets with the soprano Banse. Comparing with other versions of this opereta I could say that this is a good version and its worththe price."
4,"See and listen to Hodgson live,being the sound of Supertramp","I have already talked to you about the ability of Roger Hodgson to recreate the fascinating old moods by Supertramp, live on stage (listen to his new tracks ""Time waits for no one"" and ""Every trick in the book""), but also during the reprisal of classics by his former famous band, when He recaptures so well such pretty musical atmosphere!! (see also my review of his CD SINGLE""Open the door"", where I have described my sensations during a live performance that I saw in Milan-Italy 1 year ago).Well Roger is the sound of Supertramp and the true Supertramp don't exist without him!!Recommended for the lovers of tasteful, dynamic and aggressive pop!!"
2,Nothing new here,"After waiting so long for Roger to put something out, this has to be classified as a disappointment. With the exception of ""Don't you wanna get High"", there is nothing here to get the old supertramp juices flowing again (or his 1st solo, ITEOTS). Roger seems to work best in the studio, lets hope he gets back there soon!"
4,Good to hear Roger back.......,"I came across this CD in the Supertramp bins at a local music store and being a big fan of Rogers music and his former band's music I gave it a listen and I must say for a live recording they do manage to convey much of the musical emotion I have always loved. Sure there is some of the old ""Supertramp"" magic missing,(mostly in timing and percision and studio vocal overdubs etc) but there is growth from an artist loved from all around the world and a son, Andrew Hodgson, that looks tobe following in his dads footsteps and enjoyed his ""Melancholic"" piece. Not bad, I'm sure a new studio album of songs would be the usual top notch. Its also good to hear that sax of John Helliwell! I highly recommend this one."
2,Disappointing compared with Hai Hai and his Supertramp days.,"Great to see a release after so long - ""Hai Hai"" was a great album that should have been followed-up much earlier. But, IMHO, this latest album is musically very disappointing when compared to Hai Hai, but even more so when compared to original Supertramp masterpieces such as ""It's raining again"", ""Dreamer"", ""Take the long way home"". And as another reviewer said, it all sounded a bit ""rushed"". Some suggestions to RH: 1. Reform with Rick Davies and the boys - would be sensational. 2. Rumours (in the early 90's) of a project between RH & Trevor Rabin (guitarist/vocalist from Yes on the ""90125"" and ""Big Generator"" albums back in the) never happened - it's a must."
4,Serious look at prophecy concerning Israel,"If you believe in Israel's prominent role in coming world events, this book will deepen your knowledge and reveal how many churches today are unwitting pawns in a future attack on the Jewish nation."
2,new car decal,This was not exactly what I thought it would be. I was not thinking it would be a sticker. does not stay on car at all.
2,Some Less Than Great Reward,"Seemingly hacked together from magazine bits from fan magazines, NME and the like with various bits thrown in from technical publications--somewhere the real Depeche Mode gets lost. Of course, understanding it is an unauthorized book, you do hope for something more than excerpts from interviews. Alan Wilder is quoted a lot in the book which seems neither here nor there. Overall, a tedious read that makes DM seem almost boring. A Behind The Music segment would have more life than this!"
2,Ugh...,"First, I am not one of those old timers who keeps dreaming of the days when John Wetton will return, he's out of the picture and I accept that. I've learned to adapt to what the current singer John Payne has to offer just like learning to live with Steve Hogarth after Fish jetted from Marillion. I was excited when I purchased this album, Steve Howe playing with the band and an interesting track listing, plus I was curious to hear Payne sing the older songs. The actual song performances are nicely done and it sounds like the band infuses a lot of energy when performing live... however, stay away, this is for die hard collectors only. It is an audience recording, and a bad one at that. Why they couldn't take the effort and release sound board recording is beyond me..."
3,Grade C,"This cd of Asia live, is like most live Asia cds, poor. Although it is better than any Wetton Asia live cd, that's not sayng much. The recording is poor, sounds like someone out in the crowd is holding up a tape recorder. The vocals are distant, the drums hollow, and the rest all is mixed into a muddled mess. Does contain a fair look at Asia's cd up to the release of the cd, which was recorded on the AQUA tour. Sadly it's missing, their two biggest hits, THE SMILE HAS LEFT YOUR EYES & HEAT OF THE MOMENT. This cd does not fairly represent Asia in concert."
4,Excellent performance,"Despite the rough sound quality (this is, after all part of the ""Official Bootleg"" series), ""Live In Osaka"" is a good set for Asia fans to own. It's a particularly great performance from John Payne's first Asia tour, and their commitment is evident."
2,Just for fans and completists,"Asia-Live in Osaka is part of the John Payne era Asia official bootleg series. Of the three official bootlegs in this series, this is the least I'd recommend because the sound is not that good. It's an audience recording from the 'Aqua' tour recorded during the first leg of that tour and one of the first shows with John Payne as lead singer. The performances are good, especially on ""Who Will Stop the Rain"" and ""A Far Cry"". But the sound of the recording is not that good, making this album just for completists and hardcore fans of this band (like myself). Of the three official bootlegs in this series, the better sounding (and your best purchase) is the 'Live in Philadelphia', also from the 'Aqua' tour. And if you need a concert recording from the 'Aria' tour then 'Live in Koln' is the only known concert and the recording is passable. But if you need to have just one then go for ""Live in Philadelphia'"
3,Barbara's opinion,"I always get much entertainment for Jerry's videos. I enjoyedthis one, but unfortunately, not as much as the other ones."
4,Great Set,This set has helped me improve my Spanish greatly and that is a bonus as I live in Mexico.
3,"Good content, poor production","The content of this course is good, as is the method and progression.However, the production value of this course is poor. Just some examples from memory:* Disc 2: In several areas the English speaker's last syllables are cut off.* Disc 2: Several Spanish sentences at the end of the ""Bus-stop story"" are cut off.* Disc 3: English speakers announces 55, but the Spanish speaker never says it.* Disc 6: Wouldn't play, had to be exchanged.Also, as a course designed to be used in a car, the tracks are not well thought out. There are only 6 per disc, typically starting and ending in odd spots which do not make it useful to hit the rewind button. Disc 1 could have easily been made into ~42 tracks and this course would be A+.Still, the content alone is worth it, despite the flaws in production."
4,Very happy with purchase,"I know quite a bit of spanish, but this is a great way to get up to speed in a ""brainless"" way. I put it on every morning on the way to work and get my spanish lesson for the day in a no-stress way. It also gives you something to focus on other than traffic!"
3,Complete? Not really,"This is yet another re-packaged product from Language Dynamics. I own the ""Behind the wheel Spanish I"" tapes and liked them; if for nothing else, the native speaker's beautiful voice made them immensely enjoyable to listen to. And guess what, the first three CDs from this ""complete course"" are exactly the same as the first 3 tapes (out of 8) of ""Behind the wheel Spanish I"", verbatim. I suspect the next 6 CDs are also SAMPLERS from the Behind the wheel Spanish II and III (which I don't own). I wouldn't call a 3/8 course a ""complete course""."
3,Not as great as it could be,"After using the Penton ""Learn In your Car"" and reading reviews of BTW I really was expecting more. Very disappointed with the time they allow you to repeat. Almost none sometimes. There also does not seem to be a learning plan--such as basics on to a little more advance and so on. By disc 6 they get all kinds of involved with the present subjunctive and I do not really think they have covered the simple parts of the language yet. Let's face it those of us starting out need the basics first and then move on. I would not recommend this but now that I own it I will use it and gain something from it. If you really are interested in learning go to Central America and do a week or two of immersion study. [...]"
5,My kiddos love this book!,"This book is a must have! My 5 & 3 year olds absolutely love it! This book makes addition interesting, is in verse and the illustrations are adorable. My kiddos loved it so much that I've ordered Math Fables Too and Math for All Seasons."
5,fabulous characters,Ms. Colin has crafted a gem of a story. I was riveted by the characters and wanted to more and more about them as the story went on. Ms. Colin's ability to create and define her characters is fabulous. She is a natural and I look forward to reading more from her in the future
4,Good mid- price Parrish book,"This is a good entry point into the world of Maxfield Parrish for the budget conscious. It provides the usual essay on the artist's life. What I found really useful was a description of his techniques in the fourth section.It includes infrared and microscopic cross section analysis of his canvasses. If you are looking for an even more economical book on Parrish, try Maxfield Parrish by Laurence and Judy Cutler by Gramercy books also published in 1999. It always intrigues me that published reproductions of his works always 'color' differently from book to book."
5,Very good value,"I have 5 books covering the art of Maxfield Parrish, 3 hardbacks, this softback and a softback poster book. I believe that overall this softback edition is probably the best value for the money. It is a good introduction to the artist and his work. There are many beautiful reproductions of his work included and an extensive index."
3,"27 Watt White Light replacement Bulb, for Bell & Howell #1227","I am perfectly satisfied with Amazon's service, however, I never got a chance to try the new replacement bulb. When the original bulb on the Bell & Howell Sunlight Desk Lamp blew, it shot fire from the base of the bulb onto the reflector discoloring the white finish. My wife was scared of keeping it in the house, so even with the new bulb, she would not allow it to stay. Thanks for the good service, Gene."
5,27 Watt light bulb,I am pleased with the item I purchased the replacement 27 watt white light bulb.And very pleased at how fast I receivec it.
3,Flicker Flicker Flicker,"These are good for white light, aids in working on small items but after a few days the lights begin to FLICKER then working with them becomes very annoying.Better than any of the other after markets I've found but a poor substitute for the original"
1,Piece of Garbage,"I purchased this bulb in March and less then 6 months later it is burnt out. This is a worthless piece of junk, but since it is specific to a particular lamp fixture, we are once again, held hostage."
1,Who Needs More Advertisement?,"I quite agree with the other reviewer here; the ""Pro Tools Bible"" starts out with a short section dedicated to an incomplete understanding of a few superficial basics of the program, then degenerates entirely into a collection of what amounts to advertisement for a pile of commercially available (and, yes, overpriced) plug-ins. I waited a long time for this book- for some reason I had high hopes for it- because of several publishing delays. By the time I got ""Pro Tools Bible"", although Digidesign's manual (included with the program) is miserably confusing (as included handbooks are prone to be), I had already learned everything in it on my own."
2,Ok but far too technical,"If you're a complete beginner you may want to find a better book, this one is far too technical & complicated. This book is better suited for the intermediate to advanced user."
5,Buy It!,"I have most of his recordings, and this one is one of the best. (If not THE best...) This recording is essential in every collection. Almost all the songs are great. 'Family Business', 'The Company' and 'Clichè' are worth the price tag alone. Buy it!"
4,Excellent CD-Grows with each listen,"I have found myself listening to this CD over and over. Not only do the lyrics sneak up and surprise you with their complexity, but the music grows on you as well. A definite achievement for Westerberg."
3,"Great instrumentals, not-so-great singing.","Lili Haydn is a powerhouse violinist, and this album holds some beautifully melodic instrumentals, including a ten-minute jam with George Clinton and Pharaoh Sanders. However, the album falters with her singing. The new-age timbre of her voice combined with her cheesy/obvious lyrics distract from the music that would stand so beautifully on its own. Haydn emotes so much with her violin that she doesn't NEED to sing, and I hope she'll just stick to her awesome instrumentals in the future."
1,Should Stick to Instrumentals,"Sorry, but this person can't sing and definitely cannot write a song. And the earth-babe pose on the cover somehow makes it worse. The violin playing is nice, but swamped by an overproduced techno beat and cheesy instrumentation.Save your money.....it tires after one listen."
4,This albums speaks volumes of growth....,"When I first listened to this album, I thought ""wow, something new and poppy. Not as good as her debut album"" Which was soo incredible and over looked. This is completely more poppy than her last one, maybe in an effort to appeal more to audiences. But the lyrics are true and more personal than ever! For sure BUY the ALBUM! its sooo deep and honest. Reaching new height that shes never touched before seriously."
5,Great Addition,"I bought Gout Hater's Cookbook I for my father, who suffers from Gout. He liked the recipes and the information so much I also bought Gout Hater's II and III. He has thanked me many times for this very helpful resource."
2,Under My Expectations,"I was disappointed in the book because I was expecting a listing of foods and their purine content. What I got was a vegetarian cookbook. The writ-up about it didn't promise me a listing, but I thought it would be a natural inclusion. It wasn't."
3,Take your allopurinal,"Not a bad book, the diet written in any form is no fun. I would use it if I didn't have a medical intervention. It is well written, but bland food is bland food. No one can be unhappy with pizza in their mouth."
1,Gout Hater's Cookbook II,"After reviewing a couple recipes, I found that those are NOT for the people who suffer the gout problem but quite an opposite. Some food ingredients contain extremely high dosage of uric acid. I could not understand how publisher of this title did not review the food and recipes with medical professionals. I am extremely dissatisfy with the book and would like to return."
3,"Good product, bad picture","Anchovy paste is, pretty much, anchovy paste. In this case, the product pictured is a 16 ounce jar. The actual item is a 2 ounce tube. Most misleading. Beware."
4,Open Court Sounds and Letters,"This workbook corresponds with the Open Court kindergarten or beginning reader text. It is not to be used as stand alone workbook.The Open Court Reading curriculum provides a solid, base classroom reading program. Teachers will need to supplement instruction for struggling students or for students who need frequent review and repetition."
2,Not enough info...,...for starting your own service. Found another book that was MUUUUCH more useful for this purpose. www.concierge101.comInvaluable resource for launching my business!
5,"""NIKKA!!!""","If you dont have this album you crazy.. thats dead up.. the boi is back, and he is really killing it exspecially on ""WHo put it togeter"" ""amped up"" and ""Putcharaggsup"" and the one on his mama banging too! All the beats are bumping way better than mannie fresh happy A$$ beats.. pick this up, if you know the definition on hip HOp.. SQalla NIKKA!!!"
1,Dat boo boo,"Turk done fell off on some real $@#!. He sound like he tryin too hard to sound like himself. Its really annoying. He aint wrote no new verses in a minute sound like. Everything is recycled or jus plain stupid. Don't buy this cd, flatout."
3,it makes your nails seem harder,doesn't really strengthen your nails just reinforces them like cement would. My problem with it though is that it doesn't stay shiny like someof the other stuff like this. It just dries all dull looking.
4,nutra nail,"The product that I received, is a little difficult to use. It is applied in two steps. And the second coats wants to stay sticky . A friend of mine told me the best way to remedy the problem, is to take some regular nail polish on a paper towel or cloth and wipe it lightly over the product already applied to your nails and the stickiness goes away immediately"
2,Disappointed with this pouch,"I paid $15 for this pouch at a dog store. Within the year, the hinge broke and it now opens lopsided and doesn't easily stay open.Still looking for a quality pouch."
5,Wonderful Book,"I've been looking for unusual storybook characters for stitching. Finally found them in this book! Paddington, Beatrix Potter, Madeline, Babar, Spot and others. It also has several ideas as to how to use the patterns. Most are smallish (bibs, edgings, etc) but there are some larger ones as well (samplers, puppets). I wish they would come out with a second volume!"
1,Nothing new to offer here,"I got this book to round out my studies of the 2000 election, but got a series of essays that spouted the same old ""Good decision/ Bad decision"" rhetoric. You will learn NOTHING from this book.Bruce Ackerman is much better than this. Please look at his earlier works, especially We the People (I and II), and is innovative (though idealistic) in The Stakeholder's Society."
1,Read the book?,"Did the above reviewer actually read the book? The example chapter by Charles Fried (and the first paper the book presents) is a vigorous and strong defense of Bush v. Gore. And, I doubt that Fried would consider himself a leftist legal mind."
3,"great, inexpensive introduction to the world of crosby nash","For the price, this is an excellent introduction to this group. needless to say, there are great harmonies throughout the whole compilation, which is culled from the duo's studio albums released in the early to mid seventies. this is before crosby's ""basehead"" phase in the late seventies and is recommended if you like crosby,stills and nash or their collaborations w neil young (c,s,n, &y). For the price, you can't beat it..."
2,There are better recordings...,"While I own all seven volumes of the Live in New York City series, I have to say that it seems like volumes 6 and 7 were scraping the bottom of the barrel of Neil Weiss's recordings. You would be better served buying Vols. 2, 4 and 5 for a really nice cross-section of Jaco's small club recordings."
2,"Sound quality is poor, but the vibe survives","It's a nice glimpse into the earliest days of Marc & Steve. It seems to be recorded on primitive equipment (perhaps by an audience member), so it's not the kind of record you'd play at a party. But if you're a diehard fan (like me) of this era, you'll get a kick out of hearing the energy and musicianship that was evident. It also includes a few ""demo"" style tracks, the best of which is ""Dwarfish Trumpet Blues"".Will you listen to it more than once or twice? Probably not."
4,Silly yet fun!,"Well, darn; bought this book hoping for ideas! Kidding; however they did come up with some goodies with naughty results.This mystery cozy is set in England and has the funny sign-song style I love.When four ""ticked-off"" daughters-in-law, get together, they find they have much in common and chat about ways to get rid of their acquired Mothers-in-law. The end result is funny, but has a scary moment or two. Plus I was guessing up to the end, which is pretty unusual, as I'm really Sherlock Nose in disguise!"
4,Excellent Version of Xerxes,"I have to agree with the other reviews, this was an interesting, well-crafted version of a fine Handel opera. One negative in this production is the feel of the set and costumes--very dark and cold. Perhaps this is a deliberate contrast to the warmth and passion of the music? For me it didn't work. However, the singing and acting overcame the stale, morbidity of the set. Another small negative is that Romilda, played by Isabel Bayrakdarian was, at times, a bit shaky in her voice and not completely convincing with her character. This is a small complaint considering Bayrakdarian did well enough and the rest of the cast is extraordinary, as other reviewers have noted. I found the overall production impressive. Would highly recommend it."
4,Sexy and Comfortable!,I am a big fan of Carlos Santana shoes and have several pairs. These shoes are sexy and comfortable. They will surely make you stand out in a crowd and get noticed!!
1,if i could i would give it zero stars,"This book offers nothing in the way of practical information. It may be inspirational to some, but it should not be advertised as a yoga book if it hardly deals with the subject. A more appropriate title you ask? A Book of Boring Pictures And Useless Sayings or How to Waste $25."
1,No instruction here,"I bought this book thinking it instructional in nature; it's actually a new-age sort of inspirational book.I expected an in-depth review of postures that might strengthen my computer-messed-up back; what I got was a bunch of photos of flowers and people doing several postures. What I expected was something like Iyengar's 'Light on Yoga', with maybe a couple more in-depth reviews of programs that would do something for my back. The synopsis is misleading, to put it mildly."
3,Not much substance but beautiful illustrations,I was hoping for more yoga philosophy or atleast technique but this is mostly a coffee table book. Still inspiring and pretty!
1,CUIDADO!!!!!NO ES EL MISMO WHITE TIGER,"ATENCION!!!!!, este no es el mismo White tiger de los 80 del ex guitarrista de kiss Mark St. John. Aqui hay un mal entendido terrible y le doy una estrella solo por que habia que dar una puntuacion pero en realidad no se trata de White tiger como han dicho aqui. White tiger solo realizo un unico LP en 1986 bajo el sello E.M.C RECORDS, titulado white tiger, y luego en 1999 el mismo sello lo reedito en CD. Yo tengo este disco tanto en LP como en CD y es excelente pero no esta disponible aqui en Amazon lamentablemente. Recientemente hable por e-mail con el que era manager del grupo el señor Stephen Campell y el me comfirmo la informacion que les estoy dando. Este Raw se trata de otro grupo al parecer tambien llamado white tiger pero que no tiene que ver nada con Mark st. John, asi que cuidado!!!!!"
4,Good Product,"I am very happy with the performance of this product. It has greatly improved the efficiency of my business. The scanner does a very good job of reading bar codes. It will even pick up just a sliver and slightly faded codes. I use this item with an HP PDA and it was easy to install and set up for 1-click scanning.My only complaint is that the scanner does not come with a case/cover. A $300 piece of technology needs to come with a case or at least have third party options. My PDA came with a nice case, but I have to carry my combined PDA and scanner in a zip-lock bag to protect the scanner attachment...not much protection and not very attractive."
3,Meeting of the Waters,"I bought this for one piece - Checkered Demon. The rest of the album was fine, but not to my taste. I heard Checkered Demon on KSDS radio and it really rang my bell - If you liked the Henry Mancini music in Pink Panther, this may well be for you. Plenty of brass with a musical theme that gets my gut."
4,A program you hope you never have to enter...,"WITSEC is a fine and rather quick read. Despite the fact that some may argue that the book skewed because one of the co-authors is the founder of the program, the book is balanced. It discusses the mistakes and the successes. There is some fascinating stuff here: the early fight against the mob, the Witness X tragic story (a woman who tells her own story), and a funny sequence exposing the ... ""reporting"" of Geraldo Rivera. Schur is a hero...anyone with MS who can do what he does is. The book seems to a bit rambling at times, but the stories keep you coming back for more. There was a lot history on the US Marshals and that was a bit dry at times. The book, overall, crackles with some fine stories. In the end, the the light shed on this program makes it a great read for fans of law enforcement and the true crime genre."
4,Riveting book that was a nice read and thought-provoking,"From the first pages, I found myself drawn into this fascinating history of the federal witness protection program. Some of the tales that WITSEC founder Gerald Shur can tell are amazing - as good as some of the better crime thrillers (proof yet again that fact is stranger than fiction). Some of the stories are terrible, too, but I really enjoyed the fact that the narration comes across in that ""just the facts, ma'am"" approach that doesn't attempt to skip or gloss over or put a spin on the mistakes and problems that came up. Overall, the book makes a powerful statement on why we have and why we need such a program."
4,good nonfiction,"Length:: 7:17 MinsNot that I read much nowadays, but I'm almost finished with ""Witsec Inside the federal witness protection program""I am on chapter eighteen, so far the book has kept me coming back to finish it. After reading it you understand why there are people out there IN THE witness protection program that vocally say it's not a good thing. But WITSECs role in the history of the mafia, drug wars, and other major changes in our past is worth reading. I found the information about Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Adler ""Barry"" Seal fascinating. Barry was the youngest to captain a 747, an ex green beret. His demise is chronicled as he endend up working for the drug cartel, then an informant for the US government. He liked living dangerously, funny how that keeps some people going, all the excitement and risk.I mostly ordered the book because of a murder I was researching, I wanted to see the possibility if this girls dad was put into the WITSEC program."
5,The Good Life: Helen and Scott Nearing's Sixty Years of Self..,This book is an old favorite for the back to the land movement..I bought it for my nephew as I read it many years ago and it inspired me to live and garden rurally.
5,Perspective Changing,"I read this book in 1990 as a freshman in college. At the time I had never read anything like it. Leaving the big city, the Nearings set out to live a self-subsistant life. Part how-to manual and part philosophical treatise, the two books in this volume paint a picture of good old American independence. Over a lifetime, the Nearings try to live a life unencumbered by the burdens piled on the average laborer in the twentieth century--and by all accounts they succeed.The quotes that introduce each chapter are tedious, but those who skip those pages will not miss them. From their experiments with farming to their commentary on living a simple life, it's a hard book to put down once you've picked it up."
5,A truly inspirational book!,"Since I was a little girl I've dreamt of living on a farm. Growing my own food. Gaining my daily exercise while I do my chores. Today I'm in my early 30's and still have a strong desire to live a life similar to Helen & Scott Nearing. This book was such an inspiration to me! ""The Good Life"" has made me yearn even more for a healthier, and fruitful lifestyle. I'm thankful that Helen & Scott were such generous people and willing to share their experiences and knoweldge. I only wish that I had the opportunity to meet these beautiful souls and share a few days labor, meal and conversation with them."
2,Not a how-to book,"I was very interested in reading about a couple who took the plunge and homesteaded. I found the references to why they moved to the homestead interesting, but unfortunately, the rest of the book is interweaved with this philosophy as well as social issues. The practical is overshadowed or not explained in detail. The detail that is there focuses on what they did not how they did it. If you are looking for a how-to book, you should look elsewhere. I did find the section on health interesting and helpful. Also, the second section, ""Continuing the Good Life"" had some practical ideas on gardening. Overall the book was a disappointment, since I expected a how-to book not a philosophy book."
3,Where Is The 2nd Edition Version,"This magazine article size book just barely skims an incredible history that can only be described as a saga of the old South,un beatable in drama and triumph.The 2nd edition,which is not mentioned on this entry,is several times longer,thanks to my late father contributing a mother lode of data for the author to source from.The Greenes and Hills fought Seminoles,damnyankees,religious persecution,murder,poverty,illness,nazis and Utards.The thousands of offspring today of giants like Elisha Greene,James Hamilton Hill,Thaddeus A.Hill and George Paul Canova show the product of their sacrifices justified."
4,Broadcasting Mic,I am a Dj and the SM7B is a pretty good mic it is clear and has an occasional pop. I think that for on air use it is a good affordable buy. I would recommend it very highly.
5,Works well with Samsung 46 inch,Decided to go with this model given that I needed to hang my 46 inch Samsung TV from the side of a wall. That area is 5 inches wide and divides master bedroom from sitting area. This unit only uses four screws to affix itself to just one wood stud. This had me worried since my other mounts affix themselves to two studs. This mount gave me the flexibility of swinging it to view in either room. The swivel is smooth and manageable.Mount was easy to install and for now I see no danger in it not holding the 61 pounds my TV weighs (rated for 80 pounds). Recommend it you have the constraint of having only one stud available for your mounting area.Fairly easy installation
1,Potentially dangerous stretches,Kit Laughlin's egocentric viewpoint leaves little room for alternative views and methods of treatment. These stretches are not appropriate for every body. Not every body part needs to be stretched and this is not made clear. This book in the hands of untrained people could be dangerous.
5,Stretching & Flexibility,"If you are an athlete recovering from injuries and if you like movements in yoga, you will find this book helpful. I got it from the library, renewed it three times and decided I needed to own this one. It offers good photos and written detail on how to perform each stretch. It also provides a ""program"" for various types of sports, i.e. tennis, basketball,etc. You will want this book in your own collection if you are active."
1,"Fine, if you have a partner.","I received this book very excited about possibly finding a great stretch book that would help in flexibility. I suppose I was looking for a more simple book of stretches, which this is not.There are 96 stretches through 269 pages of book. And if you don't have a partner to help in stretching(which I do not), you may as well cut out half of those stretches. There is a few good stretches in here, but most I already knew. I suppose I would conclude this by saying that if you are looking for an easy to understand stretch guide without all the jargon and more one-person stretches, then this book is definitely not for you."
2,copy protected,Love Anthony Hamilton but I won't buy his cd again because I can't put it on my ipod. His music is great but I have to actually put his CD in the machine to listen to him...too much work for 2008.
1,Quite possibly the worst album ever made...,"I don't know why they bothered with the extra copy protection, who on earth would want a copy? It's typical big corporate produced music, not creative or original in the least."
3,A few good songs,"I like this style of music. But as far as this album goes... It's just ""OK"". It's one of those albums that is nice to have if you want to listen to that genre, but not necessarily something that you'd listen to every day. The stuff gets quite stale after a little bit. :("
2,Huh?,"I really wanted to like this album. Hearing Hamilton on the nappy roots album made me excited about making this purchase. Hamilton's voice reminds me of Charlie Wilson (though nowhere near as seasoned). The problem with this disc is not vocal ability, it's good song writing that this cd is lacking. Maybe if he gets a chance for a sophmore effort, JD will spend the money on some good writers and producers."
2,Darrius Rucker Meets Tracy Chapman,Anthony Hamilton has that Woodsy Vibe going for Him.I like the Presentation but I can only vibe with it for so long.Lyrically He is Challenging in places&Vocally He can make His point.but the songs on a whole while having Moments don't quite add up to what He is Bringing thus far.the next album will be the make or break for Him.
5,WOW,"I am a music fanatic, I've been telling people about music for years, reviewing CD's before they are released, my friends always come to me to find out my opinion on CD's. Well let me tell everyone about this one right here. You want something soulful? You want a CD that you won't stop listening to for months, well then this is the CD you need. If you remember Alexander Oneal from the 80's, then you'll feel Anthony's voice, if you liked the soul that Otis brought to the table, then you'll feel Anthony's vibe. If you don't like this CD, then you really should see a DR."
5,The is great!!!!!!!! A++ for A Hamilton,"Anthony Hamilton is one of the most talented brothas picking up a microphone today. His vocals are intact, and his production and writing is of high quality as well. One of the best Cds I own, get it. This, for me atleast, is an instant classic. I lover every song on this Cd."
5,Timless Music...in time when most music is garbage,"I liked Anhtony Hamilton from his appearances with 2Pac and Nappy Roots and even heard a small buzz about him from his past. I wasn't expecting much from the album, but it is a classic. It's real music. Alot of artists sample and remake songs but Anthony Hamilton was strategic in his choices because the songs he remade and/or sampled actually make sense and have a meaning. The is a timeless and classic album. Right now music is garbage, and people are rushing cd's out or putting out a cd with singles and fillers...this cd will always be this good even 20 years from now. Music is back!! Much love to Musiq Soulchild too!"
1,CD doesn't work in all players,"I was excited to get this new CD yesterday, but I struck a problem the moment I got to my car. My car CD player spat out the CD immediately and refused to play it. When I got home I found I couldn't load the songs onto my MP3 player either. The only thing in my whole house that would play this CD was an old boombox. If you look at the fine print on the back of the CD, they have done something to this CD and it only works with certain types of CD players!!I don't know what an up and coming R&B artist like Anthony was thinking when he allowed this to be done to his new CD. I will be sending it back tomorrow because in my opinion it's faulty!"
5,"Can you say ""Charlene""?","I love this CD from beginning to end, I only wish that I had been up on it sooner. This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to from beginning to end (and back again) without skipping once. Charlene is obviously my favorite track, but the entire CD is satisfying."
3,it has its moments...but more importantly,"I've been reading some of the reviews, and I tend to agree for the most part, with those who find that this has been done before. But my quandry is...do I support a potentially great artist whose material didn't quite do him justice, OR be continually barraged by the less talented vocals and songwriting of what sells 2 million copies every time out (ie. Usher, and Ashanti)? Well my money is better spent on Mr Hamilton, than his styleless contemporaries. While I'd never call him a neo-soul or nu soul artist, he is definitely old school rhythm n blues. I'm not the biggest Jermaine Dupri fan but he is definitely to be commended for taking a chance on a style of singer that we don't get to hear much anymore, and getting him exposure & airplay. As for the CD? Sure it's could've been better, but what's better than the CD is the passion in his voice. Whats that? Passion? R & B? In the same paragraph? It must be the heat!!!"
4,Amazing Disc,"I recently bought Anthony Hamiltons ""Comin from where im from"" and I havent put it down yet. His melodic voice crouns over southern soulful tracks and takes you back to the good ol' days. His style would be most defined now adays as neo-soul, but his cd is truely one of a kind. His cd covers all genres, especially hip-hop, with using the famed Jay-Z beat ""Mama loves me"" as his opening track, ""Mama knew love"". This truely is a must buy"
5,Music to free your soul . . .,"He begins my day he, ends my day . . . His music transends color and culture . . . it allows me to be free and it allows me to experience life as it is. Its real . . . its the truth . . . it can make me cry it can make me whole. Thank you for bring this work together to aide me in seeing life's realities. His voice combined w/ imagery of this work is intoxicating. Just as I have to have my morning coffee or my tea in the evenings I need this CD daily!!! If your tired of the bumblegum artist then give A. Hamilton a spin, you wont regret it!!!!! Its freedom for your soul for only $9.99. Why look elsewhere and get less??"
5,Extremely talented artist,"Anthony Hamilton is a great artist and performer, I recently atteneded his concert in Atlanta, and I must say that he is wonderful in person. The radio and cd does not do his voice any justice, he's better live. Thank you Anthony for such a wonderful perfomance. And to all the negative fed back you do not know your r&b music."
3,Not Bad,"I came across Anthony Hamilton after getting a sampler Cd from HMV which featured' Better days'. I must have rewinded that one song more times than I care to remember. Based on that excellent song, I was chomping at the bits for the CD to be released. Well my Little Sister beat me to the punch, so I was able to borrow her copy. To be honest, my view upon hearing it then, is the same as now. Whilst I'd admit the Mr. Hamilton can sing, and there are some nice moments on board, to my mind it's not a must have 5 star release. I don't know if this says more about the R&B scene nowadays that an OK release that hankers back to the Southern Soul sound of yester year is treated as the next best thing. Oh, I still love 'better days'."
1,Misogynistic and Abusive Lyrics!,"Are you people nuts? How much did Mr. Hamilton pay you to write a good review of this crap? I bought the CD based on the first 50 reviews I read and I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!! When I heard, ""I'm a Pimp, I'm a Pimp"" in the middle of the cornbread song I couldn't believe my ears. Then later, in ""Lucille"" he sings ""I didn't mean to hit you"" or something to that effect. It's very low and subtle, but it's there. Such beautiful music, instrumentally, and then he throws that in there! He's a wannabe and not a very good one. Save your money for Kem or Ledisi."
4,I'm a little late in the purchasing...,"This cd was released in 2003, so I am a little late in the purchasing but I am glad I did, even a late purchase is better than no purchase at all. I really enjoy this CD."
5,BEST ALBUM I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR,"Truly a shame if consumers are being gipped by encoded copyright protection because this is an outstanding album.Delivers equal parts of raw-funky-rough with refined-mellow-smooth. Way to put it down Ant, way to put it down.Word-of-mouth has this a hot CD in DC--that same buzz will kill momentum if folks have to wonder whether the disc will play when they get it home. Let's get smart on the second shipment. You've got a hit on your hands."
5,Anthony is a classic!,"A classic! Must check this out if u like Anthony's soulful, down to earth voice. He sings effortlessly as he pours out his heart. If u like his sound in general then you will enjoy this album. Don't sleep on Anthony. He just keep them coming and keeps coming up with albums worth buying. What a natural talent. A mix of slow and more upbeat songs."
5,Music for the soul!,"I first heard the title track on my way home from work and it worked me from my head to my toes! I loved it! At first I thought it might have been Bill Withers, but I immediately knew it wasn't -- it was a younger voice with a different twist. I contacted one of our local radio stations for help with who the song was by. Then I went right out to purchase it. This young man has something that has been missing from our musical experience for a long time. Everybody needs to go out to purchase his CD for support and encouragement for his future endeavors. Don't go for bootleg or burning although he allows for us to do that. Buy, buy, buy!"
5,NOBODY TOUCH MY CD!!,"Oh yes....this CD is the best investment I've made in a while! I play it over and over...tracks 5 and 9 are really deep, soulful but track 11 really gets under my skin!!GO BUY IT NOW!!"
3,It's alright,"The songs he has on here are decent. I wouldn't actually play the CD every single day, like I do a lot of my CD's. But his CD is the type I'll play once in a while. I would recommend it, but borrow it first and see if u like it enough to buy it. It's a whole lot better than Alicia Keys. That much I can say."
4,Ipod Transfer,I had read a review that indicated that you cannot transfer tracks from your PC to an ipod. I recieved the Anthony Hamilton CD for christmas and transfered it to my ipod from my PC. I am listening to it now as I write this. Thanks.
3,Watch out--spyware and heavily copy-protected,"This is CD is certainly Anthony Hamilton's best, but that still isn't saying as much as it should. Especially for all the hype. He has been compared to Bill Withers, but he is way less interesting and much more easy-listening/smooth-jazz than Withers. He never really goes all out. That being said, unless you really like Hamilton, I would avoid this disc. It is heavily copy-protected--it cannot be played on the computer at all without agreeing to some suspicious spyware-looking licensing agreement. And forget about puting it on your iPod or other device."
5,A Soulful Experience !!!,"Great CD...Anthony is a Talent in his own right and has a big future in the Music world ...I was pleasantly surprised when I went to see the Movie ""Coach Carter "" and Comin from where I 'm from "" was played ...the Duets on the CD are exceptional ..I wonder if Anthony is related to a certain Dave Hamilton from Detroit who made some Musical Soulful Masterpieces during the Sixties....its a Stretch ..but you never know in the Musical business ,the Genetic predisposition to creative Magic."
5,yes,dont even waste time just get this you will love love love it i play this so much im going to have to order another one
5,10 stars!!!,I had the pleasure of seeing Anthony Hamilton live just 24 hours prior to writing this review. In a word AMAZING. I came home and ordered all his CD's. You should do the same. Every song is a hit...he is soulful and truly a joy to listen to.
4,He's a soul man!,"Deeply soulful brother, favorite tracks are ""coming from.."", ""Lucille"" and ""Float"". He really does sound like Bill Withers, what a voice. There were some moments of overproduction but overall I recommend this CD."
4,SOUL BROTHA NUMBER #1 !!!!!!! THE VOICE,"If you are a fan of true soul music or not!!! Buy this album so that you can appreciate this ultra talented brother. It's been a long time coming for Anthony Hamilton and he has been well worth the wait. I keep this in heavy heavy rotation!!! It's a reel to reel listen...I love every song but my favorites are Cornbread,Fish and Collard Greens, Charlene, I'm A Mess, Better Days and I Tried. I was going to write this review prior to seeing him perform at the Bottom Line in NYC on Dec 4th. I am so glad I waited because his live performance is even better than the album!! SO...cop that disc and get those tickets he's currently on the east coast and his website at www.anthonyhamilton.com will give you a schedule of his upcoming appearances. We have to share the GREAT music so radio will play it and in this case the artist gets the recognition and support he so richly and finally deserves. Keep Blowin' Ant and I'll keep listening God Bless!!!"
5,Beatiful Music,This is one of the greatest CD's I've heard in a long time with actual instruments playing. Anthony Hamiltons voice is mesmerizing jump on the band wagon click the add to cart button.
3,An Easy Read - But Not Inspiring,"I found the book to be an easy story line to follow, and while Newton's life was remarkable, the book was easy to predict. The book was less than I assumed it would be, with an inadequate climax feeling like a side issue. However, when I finished, I couldn't help but sit back and say, ""Wow! What an extraodinary life""."
4,"Great comprehensive anthology, but in small print","I bought this anthology when I was studying for my comprehensive exams. It is an excellent ""greatest hits + a little more"" anthology -- there are some nice unexpected additions, such as the poems from the Findern MS. I think you get a good sense of the edited, published literature available from the time period. However, the one drawback to the anthology (same is true of the Blackwell Medieval drama) is the extraordinarily small print! The pages are much thicker than the Norton, which is nice, but the text is extremely small. Aside from that, I think this is a good collection for teachers or students of the period."
2,Horrible word usage!,i was very disappointed with this book! yes it gave you some history about Detroit and other artist but honestly...i needed to use a dictionary for a word in bascially every other sentence! the word usage is too complicated for the book to have a decent flow to it. i'm trying hard to finish because i really want to know Eminem's story but it's very frustrating!
4,interesting,the most curious part were these mysterious people who helped to mold and cultivate him before he ever met Dr. Dre. i wonder if they were the illuminati
5,Rockabilly punk,"Robbie has it nailed down. Like Tom Waits you have to see Fulks live and in the flesh to appreciate his boney delivery of his right on music. He's a funny dude to watch, and a gentleman to talk to."
1,I'd give a negative 5 stars if I could,"This is THE WORST, most high maintenance, poor quality, constantly clogged and messy excuse for a vacuum that I have had the misfortune to own. I've been more happy with the $50 vacuums from Walmart than with this piece of garbage. The duster attachment stopped working after being used one time, the hose always manages to get stopped up right where it should enter the dirt bin and proceeds to fill up through the hose before we even know what's going on. What a nasty mess to clean up! Micro-fine dust and junk I've just sucked up are NOT what I want to be getting all over my hands and in my breathing space. Then the filter gets clogged so quickly that it needs to be cleaned out after each use. Give me a vacuum with a bag any day! I'd much rather throw out all the crud in a bag than to have to deal with the plume of who-knows-what that flies around when trying to clean it out. We bought ours new, not refurbished, so there is no excuse."
3,"""Refurbished"" is ""Used"" in my case","My unit is not ""refurbished"" as I understand the term. It is a used vacuum cleaner. The dust bin and filters have been replaced, but the wheels are actually worn down from use. It's also scractched and scuffed from a fair amount of use.No attachments, no directions, no screws to hold the handle in place (luckily I had 2 that fit).This may be a fair value for the cost, but it is not as represented."
2,On off switch broke!,Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :-(
5,Great Electronic Compnent Storage,"After looking around for some sizable circuit component storage devices, a friend told me about this. He gave it great reviews and actually let me use it for a while. Since the spring and summer is approaching for Michiganders, he needed it back, being an avid fisherman. During my time with this tackle box, I fell in love with it. I had to myself one.The 3 bins included are perfect for storing my resistors, diodes and caps. Perfect for mini-ATC fuses. The construction is solid, and looks good.You will not be disappointed.Just a side note: This tackle box is rather large, not heavy, just takes up space. Check the dimensions to see it it will suit your needs."
1,Much ado about Photos,"I guess I must have read a description of the contents and completely misunderstood what this book can offer the reader. I'm not sure why anyone would want to ""write"" (That's a generous verb) a book about the junk they have purchased and take pictures for all to see. There is very little written content, lots of pictures and, generally, of no conceivable use to anyone. I had thought the book would track ""junk"" purchased and then fixed up, painted, decorated with plants, etc and then used cleverly in the garden. Wrong, wrong, wrong! It is nothing more a collection of pictures of the ""junk"" purchased and a few comments about each picture of the ""junk"" . Extremely disappointing and, for my money, will become JUNK!"
2,Pretty pictures but no substance,"I must agree with ""npowers"" of Vermont: I, too, was expecting at least a little more prose and some helpful advice on acquiring desirable garden junk, but alas, I was disappointed. The photos are great and perhaps this would make a good coffee table book but buyer beware if you want substance."
2,Good Tape but not what I ordered,"Overall, this is really good handlebar tape, but it's getting 2 stars because it's not exactly as advertised...The main problem I had with this is it was not what I ordered, specifically the color. On the order page, I chose ""black"" as the color, expecting it to look like in the picture. What they sent me was ""soft black with white logo."" The tape is black with the ""Fizik"" logo printed in white all long the edges of the sides, which I think looks really tacky. I didn't bother returning it because it functions well enough and I really needed the tape due to me having already taken off the old foam I had on my handlebars. But if I order black on the product page and get sent soft touch with fizik logo then I'm not going to be happy. It looks stupid."
4,"Great tape, imperfect quality control","I've wrapped several bars with this tape. It has a great feel, a bit of cushion (less than cork but more than cloth) and looks nice. I've always had way more than enough length, even on fairly wide bars. Those who complain about length must wrap with a pretty serious overlap, or perhaps the length varies from roll to roll. I did have one package (sid blue) that tore along the edge repeatedly when I wrapped with it, no matter how little I pulled the tape. I returned it and received a new one which was fine."
3,I was somewhat disappointed,"I've installed several brands of cork tape (""gel"" and non-gel) as well as some faux leather tape (Torelli Moda Chunky) and this Microtex is by far the most difficult to install. The material is not very stretchy, and I had to re-wrap a couple of times because I would get wrinkles in the tape.I have not been on any lengthy rides so I can't comment on comfort and grip although in the short term it feels comfy and grippy enough.In terms of looks, I have mixed feelings. The white backing shows through perforations and sides and I almost feel like it's a cheap look. I will update after I go on longer rides, but I kind of wish I went with a regular cork tape.I'll update this after a couple of months and hopefully a number of miles (If I can remember to)."
1,Don't do it....,"This is the one of the poorest excuses for bar tape I may have ever used.When you do get it to lay flat it looks nice. But dealing with backing tape that won't pull off cleanly, tape that is REAL work to wrap so it lays flat. Bare minimum length; just enough to get the bar covered. No stretch whatsoever. Installing it over their own gel? Adds considerable frustration and difficulty.Surface is a little smooth and in the rain....be careful.So inferior to so many other tapes. Cannot believe it's a product from this company. If they're trying to make a tape that's cheaper than real leather, they missed.I'll rate an excellent product and provide positive feedback when it's called for. Middle of the road - maybe, maybe not. But when something is so poor and so inferior I can't hold in."
1,Rips easily on installation,"I bought this tape for my wife's bike yesterday because she liked the yellow color. I very nearly bought some for myself because of the more durable 'vinyl' feel to it. The bar tape ripped along the edges in countless spots. I was discouraged that I had just wasted 18 dollars on a product that was crap, but finished the job so my wife could still use her bike in the meantime. I am a discerning cyclist, and admittedly picky about how my bike looks and feels. I think the Fizik Microtex tape is downright acceptable. It might work for a straight bar, but not for drop bars with curves."
4,Midwest duo deliver the first seeds of genius,"It has been said in many music circles that The Frogs are merely a spoof sendup satire act that does anything it can to stir up a bit of controversy. Those accusations can be laid to rest now with the re-release of this 80's XTCish masterpiece. The band is a one of a kind, one that transcends the current drab state of pop. Long Live The Frogs! What did I tell ya, It's gotta come out!!"
2,Ouch!,Very uncomfortable because the wires were longer than the cup. Left marks each time I wore it so it has been replaced. Waste of money.
1,Poor design,"These are a nice shape and size, and the handles catch drips. But they have a major design flaw--the part of the stick that is frozen into the pop is too small, narrow, and smooth, so when you try to pull your pops out, the handle comes out and the pop stays in. I had to semi-melt the pops under hot water and use a flat spatula to pry the pops out of the base. Not recommended."
1,$3.00 at Target and ice pops just won't come out,"I almost ordered several of these last night, just forgot to checkout. And today I ran into these exact molds at the Target store, their price is $3.49. They are nice basic molds, but definitely not worth $7Update:And it is nearly impossible to remove the ice pops from these molds. I would change rating to 1 star."
5,Great Music,What a voice this man has. I enjoy it every time it come on to play on my disc player. I recommend anyone to purchase this CD.
5,When One Door Opens,"I was very well satisfied with the cd. It did take 9 days to come 3 hours away, but that is the fault of the post office. I would order again as I am always satisfied with Amazon."
3,Look inside the book,"I was looking forward to reading this book but I find it hard to read. I read a few pages, and find it interesting, but can't really say what I learned. Maybe its just me. Go to ""Look inside the Book"" and read a few pages before you buy it."
1,Is it what it claims to be?,"Considerable (and maybe correct) research on history of physics which collects huge amount of (somehow) arbitrary selected citations.Ball unfortunately does not go further than cite, repeat himself and draw mostly tautological conclusions. Not to mention his chaotic presentation of basic physics with no clear link to the murky ideas presented.This book had no value for me. Too bad I have spent time getting through it."
4,"Slow-Paced, Psychological Ghost Story","It's not at all a fast-paced story, but the atmosphere is rich and foreboding throughout, and there are a lot of genuinely chilling moments. It's a ghost story with ties to religion, family, possession, and a whole host of other issues. It's definitely a psychological ghost story, as opposed to the more in-your-face, blood-and-guts variety that has become so commonplace. Even even when the most obvious instances of horror in this book transpire, there isn't any gore, which was refreshing. All in all, it's frightening and creepy, and the suspense - though it builds slowly - continues until the very last page. It's a great book for people who enjoy ghost stories without an overabundance of violence."
4,Good for younger toddlers,"I agree with the other reviewer that the range is more limited, but I've seen 2 at work, and they both had a range of about 12-20 feet. More than enough for a toddler of 18 months or more. The remote is simple and easy to use, and yet moves the cars in 4 directions (my son is 17 months and figured out the remote right away) We have fun stacking cardboard blocks on it and running it back & forth!"
4,"Limited Range, emailed Chicco","Got this for my kids for Christmas. I read the reviews but got it anyway because I thought it looked really cute and fun. Was very frustrated when ATV and remote had to be within a couple of feet of each other to work. I emailed Chicco; they sent me a new jeep! It's everything I hoped it would be. The range is well over 10 feet. I don't know if they had a problem batch or if they have improved the product, either way, if you are having problems email them (Info@chiccousa.com). They will make it right!!"
4,Great first r-c toy,"Not the greatest remote controlled toy car out there but it does make a great first of such a toy to own. The left and right buttons turn the car as they each move it forward, therefore you can't reverse and turn at the same time you need to reverse straight out and then turn as you go forward. After playing for a week the forward button seems to steer the car a little to the right for some strange reason, it used to go straight when we first started. Replaced batteries and the same problem happens. Other than that it's pretty durable it can withstand hard knocks and rough play did not chip nor break. I do agree with a previous reviewer that there's a fixed (short) signal range."
5,really cool car,OH! We have gotten such a kick out of this little car with our 2 year old grandson. It's really a tough little toy too!
1,just trash,i have no time for reviews. you are in no position to require anything pls do not bother me again
1,Horrible,"watch Breaking Bad instead ... a joke painful to watch. Actors going thru the motions with a terrible script ,used up plot,every involved looking for a paycheck instead of a great movie"
1,Worst Flick Of 2012,"By far the worst release in 2012. Cartoonish characters, bad acting, horrible writing, over-the-top violence, a story line that is absurd, need I continue. There is nothing redeeming about this waste of 131 minutes. When I see names like Oliver Stone and Salma Hayek I should know better than to waste hard earned money."
1,savages,"movie was very boring,action was good, but not enough, will trade it in soon not worth keeping,endings were dumb. too many sex acts."
4,Worth watching,There is a lot of great action scenes that actually look believable. Especially because of one of the characters. All actors played great roles.
4,Good action and story,"Good story, loved the ending. Violent with some gore. Definitely deserved the R rating. Just the right amount of action."
4,Sort of like Blow.,"I went into watching this movie thinking that it was gonna be really bad. But instead I found it to be a likeable story. The unorthodox relationship between the 3 main characters turned out to be semi-plausible. Benicio Del Toro played a great scumbag bad guy! The story, although it may not be quite as good, it's vaguely similar to a movie like blow."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"A weak lead-up to a stupid ending, I was expecting something similar to Way of the Gun and was let down."
4,One Stop Shop!,"You get your romance and mushy stuff all wrapped up in an action packed, drug lord, Mexican stand off package. A must see!"
2,disappointed,I expected better from Oliver Stone.. Lots of nudity and violence. I would not watch again and would have been disappointed if seen at a theater.
2,Not up to Stone' s standards and missed the vibe of the book.,The Hollywood ending ruined it. No one believed in their role besides Selma. Blake particularly wasn' t into the story.
3,Nothing to right home about,Predictable at best. Action scenes were campy. B rated movie material. Word word word word word word word word word
3,movie,"I watched the movie, was not too bad. I am not sure if I would ever watch it again though because it was just kinda to weird for me"
1,Catmicklaw,"Being a massive Oliver Stone fan, I preordered this DVD, and this might possibly be the worst movie ever. It had potential, I thought it would be an incendiantary tale, with mile a minute visuals as Stone crafts in his films. The actors were the cream of the acting crop, but their roles and the whole thing was just so lame. When this movie ended, I felt like ""is that all there is?"" A true stinkeroo. I wish I could get my money back."
4,Good Action Flick,Good Action flick but Very gory! But good storyline to follow. Didn't expect the ending. Could have cut out the flying brain matter.
1,Dumb blonde goes shopping and gets shop-lifted,An inane plot about unlikable characters with a few moments worth watching: birds flying and waves dancing. A royal waste.
4,Exciting,Exciting action & adventure flick. I like the plot minus the 2 guys 1 girl scenario. That is my only knock on the flick.
3,Good story,"Good story, nothing earth-shattering. Shocking performance from Lively. Great characters. The title refers to a Mexican Cartel, and then ultimately to the main characters."
4,High expectations begone.,"It seems most of the reviewers came into this movie with high expectations based on reading the book, or as director fans. I found it a gritty, thought provoking movie with some hot scenes added to the mix. Perhaps not the ""best movie of the year"", but certainly worth your time if you find the trailer appealing. It's not an easy movie to watch, but far better in quality than most movies that float across Amazon Instant these days."
3,Disappointed,"I was majorly disappointed in this film, mostly because I read the novel and came into this with BIG expectations. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met and what I got was a huge flop of a film. Stone cut out a lot of key story sequences and good dialogue, and took away a lot of the action and a lot of characters. The only thing that translated from story to screen (which made the film a little more tolerable) was Chon and Ben. I loved Kitsch and Johnson in these roles and their bromance translate well to me...unfortunately the rest of it didn't"
2,Gory,Not much story just too much gore didn't need it to make a point.Its like they figured out the gore then wrote a story around it.
4,worth watching once,"its definitely worth watching once. I wouldnt buy it, but rent it and kick back a couple hours. Its cool."
5,tough-don't mess with people some can bite back,I think people that have that fighting spirit will enjoy this movie .maybe david and Goliath .like most good movies it needs a little more tweeking but still very good .they could do a good sequel but will probably screw it up.
4,Better than I expected,"I read the book about a year ago and wondered how the author's style would translate to film. Thankfully, I don't feel they really attempted to do so other than the exception of O's narration, and it really was not a part of the book...just a nice touch. Overall, very satisfied with the film and particularly certain surprises!"
1,Yuck!,This movie was so bad that I turned it off about 15 minutes into it. I'm sorry that I paid to rent this horrible movie.
4,Surprising,"Not at all what I expected, and a good cast usually makes a decent movie, definitely is the case here."
2,"Travolta ,....can't act.","The story is interesting enough, if you can get by with the bad acting of Travolta. There are a few loose ends, and a cop out ending."
2,It Needs More Action!,"I can get into alot of movies even if they start out slow but this movie just was not the movie I thought it was going to be.I really thought it was going to have more action in it,But it did not.Did not care for the movie."
2,way over rated,"If it wasn't so cheap I would have been totally upset at paying movie theater prices. Barely entertaining with a plot that just does not follow the characters as they go from hard nose to mushy crap. It's like they had a good idea and then the liberals changed it mid-script, it sucked."
3,Decent movie,My boyfriend really likes this movie. We saw it in the theaters and then rented it on Amazon because we missed the first part at the theaters. It's a good movie with good action and a pretty good cast. There are some cheesy parts... but overall it's pretty good.
3,Expected Better,"The story is weak and the movie plays out pretty dull. This should have been a much better movie given star power, but I can't exactly pin point what's missing. I can only say it did not deliver as expected."
3,Not Much of a Movie,Little bit hokey movie with a very hokey ending. Three stars because the blond is pretty. Rent it don't buy it.
4,excellent movie,"intense fast paced movie. this movie is very real. My father lived in Arizona for the last 20 years,he would tell me a lot about the Mexican mafia. I live in NY and thought he might be pulling my leg. This movie shows how they are crossing our borders."
4,Well done.,"Good storyline, but too violent. Good actors, and acting. Liked the double ending. Not recommend for anyone under 17. Overall a good movie."
3,Great premise but lacking something,"I expected it to be a little bit more action packed. The gun scenes were pretty awesome but I think the execution could have been revised more. Specifically, the ending was kind of anti climatic."
4,"Savages was a great, must see Movie","Not at all what I expected , but once your hooked, Its a great must see Movie. It makes us remember what Love is all about and how some will go to the ends of the earth for it...:)"
3,Mediocre,Entertaining but very little there to really make you care or want to find out what happens. I would give it a 2.5 / 5
4,Hmmm Interesting and almost too true.,"This was a well made movie that dealt with the trials and tribulations of modern drug dealing as well as the increasing dangers. Needless to say there is a lot of violence, as there is in fact with any drug dealing. Mexican Cartel against Yankee free lancers and the extremes both sides have to resort to keep things the way they want. A good watch and a little differant while being a little too true."
3,Love Salma!!,Salma and a good cast save this movie. But when you come down to it. Its been done before to many times!!
4,Great Action,Selma plays an excellent roleGreat twists and double endingConsHave seen better acting from Travolta seems like he doesn't apply himself anymore
3,Entertaining,"This is worth the watch, but not exactly what I expected. From the previews I thought the 2 guys stormed the cartels compound, but that is not the case. I guess I was just expecting something a little different. I was still entertained so it is worth renting."
1,Not to be taken seriously,I guess I dont understand how people could think this was an acceptable story line. Then the twist at the end was too much. Complete joke. I like good movies.
2,Really?,"Not sure if this was an attempt at making a modern day Pulp Fiction, if so the goal was not achieved. The acting was poor and the plot was lacking....enough said."
2,borrring,"boring and pointless, in this day and age viewers aren't all that impressed with violence porn. the characters were shallow deuche bags, and the plot fell flat."
3,Decent movie,"Decent movie, and could have been about 30 mins shorter and still been interesting. Not sure I would recommend to a friend though or ever watch again."
3,An over indulgent stoner fantasy,"I had great expectations for this flick, but now wish I would have waited for Netflix. Could have been a lot better."
4,Nice To See Oliver Stone Making Good Movies Again!,"Watched this solely because Oliver Stone directed it and it starred Bencio Del Toro. Nice to see Oliver making good, entertaing movies again; already recommended it to five other folks."
1,"Oliver Stone's worst film yet (yes, possibly even worse than the Wall Street sequel)","This movie was a huge disappointment. Bad writing, acting, directing. The 3 protagonists were not qualified to star in anything other than porn. I read the book and enjoyed it and thought Oliver Stone would do a good job adapting it to screen. Boy was I wrong. Total garbage. I would recommend this for either people who have no taste or for those who want to have a mystery science theater sort of joke fest. My gf and I did the latter, which was the only way to make this movie tolerable. Still, the $3.99 would have been much better spent on lottery tickets."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie was really good and worth watching. It was not a waste of time, I recommend it and I can even see it again. I Loved it!"
4,Action packed thriller Left vs Right,"I enjoyed this movie. The action was spot on and the drama wasn't too thick. What I enjoyed is the perspectives of the main characters. The first is a 3 tour Afghanistan Marine Veteran who is short tempered, violent, and extreme. The other is a peaceful, negotiating, calm, 'hippie' who thinks things through and talks things out. Make those two people inseparable brothers in love with the same woman and you have a hell of a film. Oh yeah Travolta is in it too"
1,False advertising,I live in Australia and I bought this version of the movie because it was advertised as an All Regions DVD. It's not. It won't work in any of our players or computers.
5,two thumbs up,"Great story, great actors, and Oliver Stone... What's not to like. It had me from the beginning right to the end... GLUED"
4,Very entertaining!,"Savages is an excellent film that shows the highlights and struggles of three friends connected to a world most fear. Two best friends, who's relationship is easily questionable, combine science with the best marijuana in the world. The women they share is kidnapped and they use wit and skill to save her. Blake Lively's acting is weak. If you ever watched Gossip Girl, she is pretty much playing Serena in this movie."
3,"Not an Oscar winner,but...","I'm a fan of almost all of the major stars in this one and know the locales well (Laguna Beach, Chula Vista). With that said, there's some less than stellar dialogue and a plot that never really takes hold."
1,Sex,2 men sharing a women I found weird but perhaps that might be what the present average viewer enjoys. The whole move stunk.
2,Just say no,Poorly implemented and disconnected movie from the characters. Recognizable actors but still cant deliver what is needed for recommending this movie. Save your time elsewhere; basic foundation for this movie is a three way relationship based on drugs.
3,"Violence is a bit over the top, but clever plot and twist ending","Overall, I like this flick. The acting was quite good and the story was well done. Clever story and very suspenseful. But the brutality of Benicio Del Toro, who I really like, was too intense in 3-4 spots."
4,Good movie,"Entertaining - a little less action than I expected but a solid story and a good time to watch. The quality on the blu-ray is great, and it includes both the ultraviolet digital version AND a downloadable digital copy."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this movie would be thrilling and exciting. But in the end, I was really just disappointed that I had wasted the 2 1/2 hours watching it. The 3some love triangle was weird and even some of the violence was unnecessary. There were some exciting parts and I was not bored but for the most part I was just ready for it to be over."
4,Good Story & Action,"The story was good and the action sequences were well paced. It didn't feel like the plot was thrown in between stuff blowing up. I didn't mind the ending, even though a lot of other reviewers did't like it. It's worth a rental on the plane for sure."
1,Simply not a good movie.,I would have turned it off if I hadn't paid for it. As it was there was a great sense of relief when it was over.
3,"Entertaining, but lofty story line","Overall, the movie is quite entertaining. Decent cinematography, good soundtrack. But the story itself gets a little over the top. I will note that I typically don't like violence in movies, so that probably has the most to do with my review. I thought the acting was good though, and it kept my attention the whole way through."
1,Dumb,Another dumb movie by Oliver Stone. I know he's a big name but I think the last few movies that's he done have been really lame.
3,OK movie,"Acting is so-so, story not very inspiring and overworked. Good time filler for one time. Like BDT, but he didn't do his best in this one..."
1,terrible.,Do not waste your time unless your worship director Oliver Stone. I was really disappointed. A waste of time and money.
4,Got it for my Dad,"Came Early, I haven't seen the film, but he liked it.I hope that is enough words??? Oh there are 3 more! Done!"
1,Disappointing,"After his hugely enjoyable ""Natural Born Killers"" I was looking forward to Oliver Stone's ""Savages"". It is dreadful. The script seems to have been written by one of the less intelligent Mills & Boone authors. John Travolta did his best, as did Salma Hayek, to make something of this pathetic script but you can't polish a t*rd! As for the lead parts, they were unbelievable and the actors were totally unconvincing. There is a reference to ""Butch Cassidy ..."" but that was then and does not justify this mess."
5,Love it,"Great movie, great actors great story Salma was great. Since beginning to end this movie was just good, good ending."
2,Waste of Money,This movie was very disappointing. I thought the acting was poor and the plot was not well developed. At times I had no idea what they were talking about.
4,savages,it was a good movie and it was worth wathcing with a very good twist .i would tell people to check it out
2,Savages,"Everyone(with the exception of Taylor Kitsch) performed as if they were in a parody of a crime movie.I can take that if everyone is in on the joke, but it appears that Oliver Stone wasn't.Ridiculous script filled with ripped off moments from other films. The voice-over narration especially was an almost exact copy in tone and content of the narration of the much better True Romance.I hope to never see another Blake Lively acting attempt."
2,a baggie full of ditch weed,"it looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing but kind burned your throat and didn't provide a good buzz.B Del Toro was outstanding and is always worth a watch. Story was beyond far fetched. Kind of like Scar Face for the 2000's and like that film, will appear to be hilarious, campy & pretty much stupid in a few years."
1,Complete trash,"Nothing redeeming about this movie. Incredibly self-important, bad cinematography, convoluted plot. The whole movie just seemed to exist to give Selma Hayek a job."
1,Terrible Movie,"senseless movie. Easily the worst movie that Oliver Stone has done. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, not sure what else to say (and I'm a fan of his previous works)"
2,Meh,"This movie really proves that Stone, needs to choose his projects a little better, this movie felt like it was dragged out and the ending was just confusing and stupid, it felt like the filmmakers just said hey let's throw some action in here that's very convoluted and ciched, and then let's confuse the shit out of the viewers.Oh and then there's certain actors in here who for better or worse ham it up big time eg. Del Toro and Travolta.A cheap rental movie at best."
4,Keeps your attention,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was sort of expecting something similar to traffic; violence and action. Story line is slightly different but still shows the same thing when it comes to drugs - Mexican cartels are everywhere and everyone seems to get paid off. Plenty of back stabbing and snitching and naturally, most get away with their crimes. Definitely not a slow movie. Worth watching that's for sure."
4,What's Not to Like?,"Taylor KItsch and that beautiful dreds dude in a 3-way relationship with a free 'n easy, sun-baked blonde...with heat and high action swirling around the darker side of marijuana commerce. Kept my blood moving!"
4,Great Cast - Unpredictable,Good movie with a great cast with out of the normal situations. Good fantasy type of movie with so-so characters becoming stronger as the movie progresses.
2,Oliver Stone has gone to seed,"It seems that not even Oliver Stone cares about Oliver Stone movies anymore, as he has done his best to make a Guy Ritchie film, here set in SoCal instead of Soho. But other than that, it all feels very familiar. Stories like this have been done before and done better. The film making isn't bad and there are memorable scenes, but everything about ""Savages"" is sort of ""eh,"" at times compelling (usually the violence) but often laughably dumb. And the attempt at a Postmodern ending is just lame."
1,Mortgage payment,"Every once in a while I believe that an actor takes on a poor script because they (like all of us) have debts. This seemed to be that kind of a movie. Make a crappy movie, collect your check, pay your mortgage."
1,Nauseating and ridiculous,"What a stupid, stupid movie. Pathetic. Has characters smoking weed like it's meth or something, just ludicrous, and utter nonsense. Most pathetic movie I've seen in a long time. Drug-war propaganda?"
3,Pointless....,as most movies of this type are but good performances by all. Well produced and edited. Solid for its type.
1,savages,I really didn't like this movie and it dragged to much and didn't have much of a story line to it
2,Terribly Thin Plot,Plot was awful. Took a long time to get to action. Action wasn't that great. Too much Granola Hippie like feel.
2,Meh.,I like the idea of this movie. Entrepreneurial young bucks in a twisted relationship with a stupid girl. One guys doing his civic duties with ill-gotten gains and the other just wants more. I actually like Benicio in this movie. Travolta is wasted. Blake Lively offers nothing but something for the boys to fight over. I can't even stand the sound of her voice narrating the film. Salma Hayek looks weak as a female kingpin. I don't like the way her character is written. It offers no real twist in her development.I'm glad I saw it but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.
4,Were they savages or brutal massacre assailants,"I thought the movie was going to drag, but it caught my attention. I love the whole concept that these business kids struck gold in what they do best and the mexican cartel wanted in on the action. That is all I have to say and you have to watch the rest to conclude this conversation."
2,I kept WAITING,I kept waiting for this movie to take off!!. IT NEVER did. It is slow and downright dragging. The cast was great. Oliver Stone is usually brilliant. I don't know what has happened. This is his worst movie ever.
2,Ok at best,"Forced acting that didnt seem natural except the ""hippie"" dude, didnt much enjoy it. A few good undertones about the DEA and entire drug scene but otherwise poorly executed. I also really disliked the woman playing the main role."
1,silly and badly acted,"just absolutely the pits beginning to end - nothing at all interesting or entertaining about this almost ""B"" movie -"
1,What an incredibly vapid and shallow waste of time.,"Throw together pointless violence, wannabe Tarantino-esq blood, the voice over of a girl with the acting prowess of a 13 year old, a pointless dream sequence, and you get this turd of a movie. Don't waste your time."
3,Ok,I didn't care for the ending at all and I thought the story would be more interesting. It didn't seem like there was a lot of story for how long it was.
1,Worthless,"Sex, drugs and violence, what a surprise! I can't believe John Travolta stupped so low to be in a movie. I am sorry I rented this video and wasted my time. It was terrible!"
3,Started out cool...,I liked it all the way until the end...the drug lord did not follow character all the way through. I also didn't like the way the threesome ended.
2,This is not the uncut version of the movie!,"I thought I was renting the uncut version of the movie, it was not. This is the same version that you can rent from the video store."
2,Not worth the time,Some good action scenes but that's about it. The plot starts off well but then drags and has a very disappointing ending!
2,Salma and Benicio outshine the rest,"I wasn't impressed with the acting done by the main characters, so I lost interest in this one. Benecio Del Toro and Salma Hayek are always fun to watch, along with John Travolta. Maybe I expected too much from this one--with it being an Oliver Stone film, on top of everything else!"
3,worth a watch,"entertaining - Salma Hayek and Benicio are the main reason to watch this. Overall, fun to watch and some cool shots."
3,predictable,not really what i was expecting.kinda got slow at times.A little bit unbelievable.i gotta type one more word.
4,An instant Oliver Stone classic in the making,Not exactly what I was expecting from the trailers but it was pretty damn good. A true Oliver Stone flick.
1,Not worth it,"Save your money. Terrible acting, terrible plot. Couldn't believe this is an Oliver Stone movie. Benicio Del Toro was great though."
1,Savage waste of time,"I can't believe people waste time making such movies, and worse we pay to watch them. I'm equally guilty for watching."
3,coulda been better,All i can say is soft core. I doesnt make sense and its random. I watched the whole thing anyways.
4,Savages,"Savages has great ensemble of talented actors as well as an engaging plot. Though we preferred the first ending, though the true ending is unexpected."
1,Disturbing and the acting was not great,I am one to enjoy a good film despite violence. However this film was too vulgar and disturbing for me. If you do not like harsh and disturbing images then I would pass as the acting and story were not great either.
3,Drug filled mess.,A drug filled mess- Extremely violent film about dopers- some seemingly good guys and some definitely bad guys. Plot somewhat difficult to follw- extremely violent flick!!
3,Weird movie with a stupid ending,"It's not too bad. Some fairly decent acting and a predictable story. The ending is just stupid. Actually, the real ending is OK but again predictable. The fake ending is stupid and adds nothing to the movie."
1,So bad,This was one of the worse movies I've seen. It wasn't funny or interesting. It was pointless from beginning to end.
5,savages,"First off, i loved this ,and i plan on buy it when it comes out. I don't know why there was bad review from other people, but i thought this movie is bad ass, and you buy it. I loved this movie from start to finish; i though that the ending could of been better. But all and all its a keeper."
1,What an awful movie,"Oliver Stone is one of my favorite directors. Many of his films rank among my favorite. That said- this is TERRIBLE. One of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible. Especially Blake Lively. The premise is great, yet the overall story ends up being horrific in the terms of how bad it is. It doesn't even look or feel like an Oliver Stone film. He must have really phoned this one in. I've seen better movies than this on episodes of MST3K. Avoid this like the plague."
3,Almost,"There was something aesthetic about the movie. Something that was interesting and kept you watching. Salma Hayek was great, enjoyed her scenes thoroughly. Blake Lively....shot a fashion shoot/ soft porno. They could have done better with another to cast as O. Travolta was great, brought a nice humor that wasn't too obvious, just right for this film. What do I know, I'm no film critic. I didn't mind watching, but I'd never watch it again, or recommend this film to anyone."
3,Eh,"Some good scenes, but ultimately cheesy. I saw the end coming. When you see the first half of the movie, it's not really that hard to predict, even the twist ending. This is definitely more a movie to rent than buy, I got this from the Redbox, and for the cheap price, was just about right. Sure, you have some big names/actors here, but the storyline itself is rather overdone and cliched."
3,It was alright,"It was a alright movie, kind of cheesy, but it was alright to watch. I think there could have been a little more quality put into it to make it better, but it wasnt bad."
2,Oliver Stone directed it??,"A silly movie. The plot is quite predictable right from the beginning. Overly bad acting. Turned it off 3/4 way through.I can't believe Oliver Stone put his name on this movie. What happened to him, where's the superb job he did in 'Platoon' and 'The Doors'."
2,bad acting and overly violent,I was very disappointed. I expected way more out of an Oliver Stone movie... The acting was pretty bad and the entire movie was violently explicit...
3,It's OK,"Having read the reviews I wasn't expecting much, but I was entertained. I don't usually have a problem with violence in movies, but I felt this was a bit excessive because it didn't add to the tension or plot. If like this kind of movie, and I usually do, you'll be entertained. If you are looking for a 'film' this isn't it."
4,great movie,This movie is awesome. I loved it. It was everything I expected it to be and definitely worth watching. if you are looking for a good movie get his one.
3,Its ok,"Sex, drugs. violence, Little guys against the big guys rescue. How to get out of sticky situation type gangster movie. If there's nothing else to watch, what the heck?"
5,Intense,I had heard good things about this movie and was interested in watching it. It was way more intense than I expected and I enjoyed the suspense. The ending provided a good twist.
3,a good watch,"Was a action packed movie, kept you watching all the time, showed a little about the drug world along the way"
3,interesting,"If you like AMC's breaking bad, you will probalby like this. Very dark, bloody film, felt like I needed a shower after watching it."
5,Savages,"It was a little slow to begin, but then turned into a great movie, Fast paced and fun to watch"
4,Savages,I liked the plot and the possible ending the movie could have taken. I really enjoyed the idea of making a living like that.
4,Gruesome,Lots of violence< i thought it was a good flick my wife thought it was a little to gory. If that doesn't bother you then its a decent watch.
4,Great unnoticed film,"This movie had all the drama and twists that you could hope for with just enough violence ( if such a thing exists), get some popcorn and settle in"
3,okay movie,movie was okay. Benecio del Toro was great in it. And I always love seeing Blake Lively. But overall plot was average
1,Not very good,This movie had the worst everything! and some how accomplished it with alot of good talent and a great director. Not a good movie in my eyes im a little shocked at oliver on this one!
3,True Romance?,"Fun to watch with great directing, but self-indulgent, not believable, full of cliched characters whom we don't really care that much about, and a half-baked plot. It's better than ""Natural Born Killers"" if only because it doesn't make you dizzy watching it. But at the end, what did you really get out of the amusement ride? Not a lot.About that ending: I would've preferred a ""True Romance"" ending, similar to the first one O tells, but with absolutely everyone dying, and no one winding up on a beach. I'd rather see someone survive the climactic shootout and wind up hiding out in an igloo, now THAT would be an interesting ending."
4,Savages,Great movie unexpectedly good best movie you will love it proof that a 3 way works lol I really like this movie highly recommended
2,Watch the trailer-see it all,This is 1 of those movies where the trailer shows all the good stuff. The ending is simply retarded. Sorry to use such a crude description but both my son and I looked at each other in dismay as the ending finished.
4,Wow,"This one took me by surprise. I wasn't familiar with the movie at all. So, we took a leap of faith and rented it.Wowzer! This was a nail biter until the very end.**SPOILER ALERT**Don't understand the alternate ending though. First ending was my preference!"
3,A worthy rental,"Not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but entertaining enough for an evening at home...Seeing it once is enough - not one I'd add to my library."
2,Unbelievable Stupid Characters,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the print was beautiful. The beach scenes show up so clear on my LED TV it was almost 3D.Salma Hayek's character seemed to be based off of the woman in the documentary ""Cocaine Cowboys"" and that woman was like a black widow spider and a shark rolled up in one deadly package.The characters in the movie were SAVAGES and they would have killed the threesome the moment Ben and Chon rejected their offer and attempted to run.Benicio Del Toro's performance was excellent. In fact without him, Salma Hayek, John Travolta the movie would have been a total waste of time.Regardless of what happened to ""O"" how did that airhead become a ruthless killer when Ben tossed his cookies when they robbed the cartel?The movie would have made better sense if O was a wife or the cartel kidnapped a child but even the O admitted she was a slut. Go figure.Glad that I didn't waste my money at the movies."
4,awesome show!,An awesome thriller with a dramatic twiSt u didnt see comin in the end....couldnt have been a better cast....definitely a lil diff
2,Quite pretentious.,"Wasn't what I was expecting at all. Underwhelmed by the acting, plot, dialogue (especially), and so on. Wouldn't watch it again."
1,Wait,"Wait until this is on TV, I thought it was going to better than it was. Probably should have read some reviews before watching it"
3,bored,"It was not the violence depicted in the trailers. Not much surprise or suspense here. I expected a less predictable, intriguing plot."
2,Not worth it,"The movie drags, there's a weird polygamous relationship, and the ending (both of them) is sort of a cop out."
2,Absolute garbage,"This was a complete waste of time, money, and acting ability. **** SPOILERS*****The story was only halfway thought through.half of a heist, half of a vendetta, some weird love story that won't be understood by most viewers then end it with not one but two idiotic endings one after the other (here is our crappy ending.... haha fooled you,here isthe real ending and its worse then the slop you just saw.)*****There were times when the director could have made something interesting and worth watching, but instead went the complete opposite direction."
2,Overhyped,"With Oliver Stone and the cast I was hoping for a diamond in the rough, shaky writing and a terrible ending really did me in. Not bad enough not to watch, but not recommending as a 'must see' either..."
2,Poor Story with awful actors,Poorly made movie based more on soft porn than a real story to tell. Too many characters confuse the viewer and the actors are strictly 3rd rate.
3,Savages,I enjoyed this movie. It was not very well done but still entertaining. Casting was good and the storyline was pretty good as well.
2,Not what I was expecting,"The trailer did a good job of hiding all the bad parts of this movie, namely the love triangle. The action element of this film was good and so was the pot/cartel element but the leading lady/love triangle element ruined the movie for me."
2,not great!,Not the worst movie ever but definetly not the best movie ive ever seen. It entertained for a bit. Would not buy.
1,Too violent,This film is very bloody and hard to follow at the end I think the script could have been better
4,Enjoyed the Movie,"The film was all I expected and more, However, it stopped twice for a few minutes to download during watching."
2,Too much sex and didn't deliver the message well,"Movie depended on the draw of gratuitous sex to make the story sizzle. For those looking for porn, they would have gotten a kick out of it. There was a typical storyline about drug deals gone bad. The savage acts weren't so surprising or menacing as they may have intended them to be. Salma Hayek over-acted in some parts. The end message was that small time drug dealers could get away with this kind of thing. Very disappointing movie with unnecessary sex scenes."
5,Superb introduction to Lisp and customizing Emacs.,I found this book very helpful in learning Lisp and learning how to customize emacs.It will help you write your own customizations for emacs and even a little acquaintance with this book will help you incorporate other people's emacs customization code into your version of emacs.There is a lot of Lisp code available on the net for emacs but you probably neeed to customize it for your purposes. This book will teach you how.The book is very clearly written and organized and requires little knowledge of programming.It is nice to have the hard copy but the book is also available in free electronic form on the Web.This is one of the best computer books I've read.
2,The Complete Idiot's Guide To Jack Russell Terriers,"I found this book to be inconsequential. The author could have condensed it to 20 pages and still would have gotten her point across. All the information on the sections were repeated in many different ways. The only beneficial portion in this book was ""the least you need to know."""
2,Okay,I received my item within the estimated shipping time. But the muffler i received was completely different. Not even close to resembling the picture. The one i got was a chambered straight 4inch outlet. I used it anyway. But wasn't exactly what i paid for.
4,Exciting Escape-From-POW-Camp film,"Personally, I thought that this gritty film was a lot better than the splashy, silly and more expensive ""The Great Escape"". It is definitely more suspenseful and a lot more realistic. Worth watching."
3,Not The Great Escape,"This movie tips its hat to The Great Escape but falls quite short of it in terms of watchability and being memorable.The idea of a prison camp with rebelling German POWs was intriguing but didn't really carry itself through the movie.The mutual respect of the two main adversaries could have been a strong dynamic to play upon but it sort of fell apart quickly 3/4 of the way through.The tunnel and costume prep by the Germans was clearly inspired by the Great Escape but didn't carry the same level of excitement.The ending, though ironic, was disappointing."
5,Great CD,"There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. I bought this because I am a fan of Alice Cooper, and his band is so awesome that I wanted to listen to what they did on their own. I love the music, the lyrics, and his voice. Not a new release by any means, but I feel certain if I'd bought it when it was new, I'd still be listening to it today. It's an incredible CD and I plan to get his others."
1,Terrible Choice,"This book has a 1998 copyright date -- that's my own stupidity! To quote the author, ""buy in haste, repent in leisure."" I bought it because of the reviews on the site.Always check the copyright date before you buy!It is verbose and without substance.If you've spent more than a week in any kind of enterprise environment, you should know most of what is in here.If anyone really wants it, I'll gladly give you a good deal on my copy!"
3,Good Hands On Desk Reference,Provides a soild review of the fundmentals required to run and maintain an effective IT help desk.I found the information for collecting and reporting help desk performance data to be of great value.I use the collective information as a daily referecnce to help ensure that my help desk delivers top notch customer support.
3,Ritual of the Savages,Good Album - Barrence yelps with the best. Wish I could get Dig Yourself on CD!
5,Inspirational Must Read!,"Style, substance, and life affirmations make this book a must have. It is a book that you will read over and over again.Use it to center yourself, inspire great things, and to takecontrol of your life as the Italians have done for generations.I have always admired this culture and Ms. Mautner has captured it in every aspect of daily living."
2,"Disappointing, Superficial, Minimal Examination of Italian Lifestyle","Superficial, almost no examination of Italian families----rather it is filled withgeneral advice about being a decent human being. II found this bookso lacking that I read less than three chapters.The title implies that Italian Lifestyle is the topic. The author uses thisonly as a take-off runway for her advice about managing relationshipswith others.Rarely does a book disappoint me so much. Almost also there are at leastnuggets on insightful information on a topic. I am sorry that I am leavingsuch a negative review, but feel compelled to do so given that the titleis so misleading. The advice of how to maintain relationships is so wellknown, written about, etc-----but that is not why I spent $ on this book."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book after travelling to Italy and falling in love with the place and its customs. However, I found it to be contrived and a thinly veiled rehash of a lot of other self help books out there. I guess I was hoping for something more."
1,Contrived and Elitist,"In the epilogue, the author expresses her resentment of how ""Hollywood"" stereotypes Italians. Perhaps she hasn't noticed that the preceding chapters do exactly that, but instead illuminating all the ""positive"" sterotypes of italians. The Italian people are diverse just as Americans, and it is unfair many of them do not live the ""dolce vita"" as described. I am sure there is a decent amount of dysfunction, divorce, obesity, and other social problems in Italy as well, while the author describes it as a sort of ""flawless"" culture. I agree that Italy has a rich cultural heritage, but this book can seem contrived and elitist."
4,Best Vitamin C Powder,"I really like Kal C Powder. Although, I think the price I paid is pretty high. I don't save much other than a trip to the the health food store. My order was shipped correctly and expeditiously."
4,A good screenplay,"Although i realized i've had purchased a screenplay when i recieved it i thought is was good and it is nice to see pictures and read the director's notes about making the movie, really interesting"
5,Lovely coffee table book,"If you are a fan of the movie (or of Orlando), this book is well worth the money it costs. It comes in a nice slip cover and has lots of excellent pictures both behind the scenes and actual shots from the movie itself. I was hesitant to buy this for the price, but now that I have it, I am so glad I did."
4,Word....,"This is a H-O-T album...If you like your music to have some variety, which Hip-Hop has been lacking lately, cop this album...I'd say its their second best effort...next to Aquemini of course...anyone who's been listening to OutKast pre-1999 (or Pre-Ms. Jackson) would agree...Still this album is one fire..."
4,Hell Yeah!,Once again Outkast has proven that they are well above most hip-hop artists with their experimental music style mixed with their usual Atlantacentric flow. Each album they release is different and describes what hip-hop truly is - a mix of all music styles mixed with some flow to get your head bobbing...Outkast is consistent Southernplayalistic music!
4,Good Marketing,"One group makes a double CD with their own material for each CD. This is a great idea and watch others will follow. This is a good deal too. Two CDs for the price of one. Just like any other CD, chances are you won't like every cut, but as a whole the CDs are pretty good."
4,what is going on here?,"first off, did they split? i mean come on, two diff. albums. its the start of the end. i loved their last cds but this is totally different. andre is making a fool of himself. his voice sucks! big boi is great and holds the original outkast formula"
5,A work approaching genius,"Hilarious, challenging and always listenable. Usually releases the critics love as much as this one are tedious or inaccessible to the average buyer. But every once in a while something comes along that makes you think and makes you want to dance equally. This one will also make you laugh out loud. Even the near misses are facinating and fun. Great, Great, Great."
1,Absolute CRAP in every sense of the word,"This double cd set was terrible in everyway starting with the absolute nonsense of the beats and the lyrics that make no sense at all.Especially with the stupid and pathetic God interlude which was more of an insult than a skit track,i mean gimme a break people-this is the reason people illegally burn music - for a double cd like this with only maybe 2 good hits (hey ya!,roses) and yes i want to spend 15 bucks on this crap--wish i didnt - anyways i did sell it back to FYE though and got $6 bucks credit for it - i was suprised i was thinking i might get 1 dollar for this crap - sorry for the long review but if you really wanna hear a good cds pick up -Jay-Z - The Black AlbumKanye West - College DropoutG-Unit - Beg For Mercyheck or even if you dont own it - the original Jigga Cd - Reasonable Doubt - a classic.thanks for reading thislater"
3,why do they do this?,first things first andre 3000 fell off and almost took big boi with him. it was not worth the $10.99 i spent to listen to this garbage i just dont understand why at the peak of their careerandre would decide i dont want to rap who did he really thinkin the streets would feel this? ill never forgive badu for thisandre put a serious dent in my outkast loyalty personally my boy took it back to the store and returned the trash belowand were die hard outkast fans. big boi keep doing your thingeven if it means droppin dre below.the four stars i gave was big boi only. pink and blue please spare me this trash next time.
1,NO REVELATION,"In an effort to overcome my indifference to rap/hip hop, I tried this album. Yes, I can see that a lot of work and craft went into making this CD. There is a lot of humor in the ""lyrics"" and I can see why people get a kick out of it. But I lament that this is what Black music has come to. I'm sure they couldn't give a rat's ass about my opinion. Still, it makes me sad all the same."
1,Creativity?,"Just like everyone else, I bought this for Hey Ya and The Way You Move blah blah blah... However, I did listen to the rest of this album and was suprised to hear the same song over and over!! Every song sounds the same!! Granted, I did buy the edited version, so I didn't hear half the album, but still. Do NOT buy this album. The lyrics are crap--all these guys sing--excuse me-- talk about is sex, violence, sex, violence and sex. I regret ever buying it. Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. Ugh. I'm gonna go puke now. Even talking about this CD makes me sick."
3,Wierd..,"This is nothing like any other Outkast CD I heard. Big Boi ""Speakerboxxx"" album is alright. Big Boi flow is tight as usual, but the beats are lacking.Andre 3000 ""The Love Below"" In my opinion steals the album. There's a lot of good songs on his solo effort.Most of the things I wouldv'e said have already been mentioned in the other 100+ reviews, so I'll keep it short and sweet.Download Track 9 on the ""The Love Below"" CDIf you feelin' it, then you'll probably like it.Try Track 5 on the ""Speakerboxxx"" album, if you feelin' it, then you'll probably be ""satisfied"" with that part of the album.It's different though... I'd suggest downloading some of the songs before buying, because it ""might"" disappoint you."
3,playaz fall,stick together. afromanmusic.com. sign up for the street team. get your money's worth and buy the new disc
1,Andre's album sucked but Big Boi's was good,"This album was really dissapointing especially that song, ""Carolyn""...whatever the song's name is. What da hell was Andre thinking?!! I know he was trying something different but hello...it didn't have to suck!! It's really sad how they went from ATliens to this crap!! I'm shocked!! If Andre can't sing or if he was trying to do something different on that song, ""Carolyn""...he didn't have to go overboard by just doing whatever. Oh, it's got to be whatever!! Big Boi's cd was good on the other hand...now, he meant business. Andre, get your head straight!!!!!"
2,Why ?,"I don't understand why this album has sold 4.5 millions... ""Hey Ya"", ""Dracula's Wedding"" are the only two good tracks"
1,PLEASE...NO!!!!!!!!!,"THANK YOU OUTKAST!!! You have proven to me what I have suspected all along! All critics are nincompoops, idiots, and *shudder* pop lovers. This...album is a pile of steaming dog droppings and has the wonderful effect of making my eyes melt every time I hear that idiotic (stolen no doubt) beat ""Hey Ya"". Makes me want to vomit that these guys are up for all sorts of awards while the real music gets bad reviews from critics (Audioslave!). This is very unintelligent too. Back in the day, rap was used to convey a message, about police brutality, or the problems in the ghetto. Now rap has become a stupid pop tool for 15 year girls to think that they are ghetto. For good rap get some NWA, Public Enemy, or Run-DMC. Now, press the negative button, I really and truly want you to!"
2,"uncreative, unmoving and overrated","true rap and outkast fans will categorize this as ""the crappy one."" very suprised to see this has garnered favorable ratings. i suggest u go to the library and check this one out before feeding the music company machine any of ur hard earned moola. on a side note, why ppl actually purchase cds or dvds in our steal em and deal em Information Age is beyond me. anyway, andre's cd will appeal mainly to the melanin-challenged demographic, u know, those who think prince has talent and elvis invented rock n roll."
5,Woooo!!!! Pump It Up!!!!!,This CD sounds AWESOME in the CD player of my new red Porsche that Daddy just got me! I love speeding down PCH listening to this CD while all the men turn and stare. It's obvious they all want me. All guys do. And the best thing is that no cop ever gives me a speeding ticket! Why would they? You don't want a hottie like me on your bad side. Any hot rich guys out there that wanna spoil me? I'm worth it. shelovesbeach@yahoo.com
4,kiriakodis,"what malarki, this fitted the whole thing, the outkast way. swingin swingin swingn, like hangin in mexico for the first time with yur boys! jus chillin ya know nothins stopin ya, you are what you are, it just make you shake it, these boys know how to rhyme smooth.RF"
1,allrightallrightalrightalrightallrightallrightalrightalright,"Whoever is in charge of radio play needs to be kicked in the throat as Outkast is the most overplayed jibberish in the history of jibberishness. Total crap, straight up, Outkast is horrible."
1,Having diarrhea is more enjoyable than these cds,These cds are garbage. Save your money - you're likely to find them for $1.00 at a used cd store in about 3 months.Grow up and find some REAL music.
1,Shallow wollahs,"If you've listened to Cody Chestnut's double CD the Headphone Masterpiece (which is better than this double), you're in for a similar sharade of shallow, gushy rollercoaster try to shock me lyrics mixed with interludes. Getting hooked from the only song played on the radio is no longer for me - I'm headed for these review pages to read comments from those who actually have some sense and who care about who they're spontaneously giving their money to; those people are very few indeed."
3,Packaging for Seller,The musical content was good. I ordered this item used from the seller. I requested the clean version. The version I received had profanity. The packaging was terrible. The CD did not come in the original packaging. The CD was placed in a plastic cover and surrounded by paper towel. I was really disappointed with the seller.
3,"Geez, double CD? More like one good CD and a terrible second","Alright, this is my first Outkast album and I was all excited since it's a double CD (Big Boi and Andre 3000 have their own CDS). I found myself listening to Big Boi's slick raps more than Andre's funky-synthesizer beats with vocals that seem like outtakes from a circus album. Big Boi's CD is great with appearances from Jay-Z, Lil Jon and Ludacris. If you though ""Way You Move"" was good get ready to get blown away by such head-bobbin' beats such as Tomb of Boom, and crunked-up lyrics in Last Call. The interludes are strange, but the music is great. As for Andre's CD, Hey Ya! is notable and his collaboration deserves a couple of listens."
4,"Great concept, great album","Outkast redefined the rules with this album. It's a whole new concept, and it works. It's a fusion of many styles and ideas. To say that it's just hip-hop falls short. At times its R&B, pop, funky, even jazzy. This album is to the new millennia like Mr Jackson's Thriller was to the 80's, it's very diverse, you can find something for everyone here. The grammy was well deserved. Highly recommended."
2,"Ehh, it's ok.","Andre 3000 has probably the most annoying voice in the world. Big Boi is a little better, but doesn't even compare to rappers like Xzibit, Pac, and others. THe Love Below has gotta be one of the worst CDs I've ever heard, and Speakerboxxx is ok. Nothing special here. Roses is a terrible song, I hate OutKast."
2,What tha hell,The new album from Andre 3000 and Big Boi is not all that like most of these reviewers are saying. I just got finished listening to the both cds and I didn't really like it. I don't know what kind of trend these rappers are trying to set but its not a good one. I'm glad I didn't buy the album because I would of been very disappointed. The lyrics are not all that and the beats are even worse. what a pain to my ears. For all those who went out and actually bought the album and liked it! are CRAZY. I hated it.
3,"ORIGINAL SONG FOR ""THE WAY YOU MOVE""","Can anyone please tell me who was the original artist for the song that Outkast sampled for "" THE WAY YOU MOVE""email address isqueen_19_39@yahoo.com"
3,big boi - HOT :D / andre - SIGH :(,"ok, 4 all hip hop fans, big boi is gonna make you smile. he brilliantly brings ol school flavour into his disc......BUT during the process, keeps that original blazin outkast flava we all have come to know and love. andre on the other hand has me lost. i knew they said his cd would be very different, but DAMNNN!!!!! he is singin through 80% of the album about his damn ""love below"". i mean, if i wanted to hear norah jones, i would put my tv on vh-1. i don't mind an artist trying new stuff, but not move totally away from their style. and although you get glimpses of the andre we love, {through his lyrics}, the style he uses to put it across is wayy too much and it needs to be shot at. it is not enough 4 a true hip hop fan to feel it. do yourself a favour, cop big boi's side and use andre's own as a glass coaster. :Done!"
3,Overrated!,There are 6 songs total on both CD's that are good and have great sound to it other then that the rest of the album is horrible and too overrated!
