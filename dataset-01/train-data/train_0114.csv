4,How this book help me....,I bought this book to assist me in understanding the WISC III and how it is interpreted so I could be knowledgeable at my daughter's PET meetings. Very technical and detailed.Wouldn't consider it to be easily read but once you sit down with a WISC exam and the book it becomes much easier to follow. Would suggest to professionals as well as parents.
4,Barbara Taylor Bradford's Remember,"It had arrived in a timely manner and it appears to be in good shape but with the holidays I haven't had time to watch it, so I don't know how it plays. I'm hoping as well as it looks."
1,Boring,"The first reviewer got it right -- this is an artless and boring book. It totally fails to capture the excitement of the time it's purported to cover -- and contains a great many inaccuracies. The first ""half"" (I think it's actually less than half) of the book consists of entries from the author's own journal, which he obviously stopped keeping after a very brief period. The second part of the book picks up, chronologically, where the author's meagerly journal left off -- by summarizing the news and events of the period -- in rapid succession and without background information, personal or otherwise. As the author had ceased to keep his journal, this part of the book is sourced from archival stories from the Prague Post. Whether it is from that newspaper or from the author's own misperceptions that the numerous factual errors arise, it makes for a boring and inaccurate read overall."
4,Essential reading for anyone going to former Czechoslovakia.,"Mr. Lytle's experiences roughly paralleled mine though I spent a year teaching in the less trendy Slovak half of Czecho-Slovakia.His experience of a society in transition and attitudes toward the West are especially resonant. He was right about the beer; it's great and the women are beautiful (the best kept secret of the Cold War) I should know, I met my wife in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia."
3,A simple story of a boarder line alcholic in Prague,"Excellent story of an Expat growing up/maturing in a land of beautiful women and cheap alchol. Douglas experiences most of the travails of any foreigner who shows up in a strange and unknown country. His observations of a people who survive on $250 USD a month are interesting. His booze induced stories are well written, yet they get boaring after a while. The excitement of the story grows old quick and his return to the States is welcome. Nothing more than a man comming to terms with his existance in a beautiful place. Excellent first work, though. Just waiting for more."
2,Beware of packaging,Bought this candy because it was not in stores. Original box was damaged and looked like it had been in the warehouse for awhile. Candy was fine though.
5,Two words...AWESOME AND ADDICTIVE,"I first ran across these in a hospital gift shop. White chocolate is my weakness and these kit kats soon became my obsession. I even persuaded the school bookstore manager to purchase them and once she did, I pretty much bought half of the box, lol. Price quickly became an issue so once I saw these on Amazon, somewhat cheaper, I was sold. Price was only a few bucks cheaper than if I'd bought the whole box from the store and I do wish it was cheaper, but it'll do."
3,pretty good selection of waltzes,"My spouse and I started taking dance lessons, and needed a good CD to practice our waltz steps. This CD has music that is very easy to waltz to---each song has a dominant beat that can be easily felt while dancing. The first 6 pieces are well-suited for the traditional ""box step"" waltz, and tracks 7-15 are best used for the Viennese Waltz."
3,Not bad,"This is an acceptable CD to practice too, if not a great masterpiece of the art of the dance band. Item 1 is about 25 measures per minute; #2-6 about 30mpm; #8-15 nearly 60mpm. So, six songs for the standard waltz at a pretty slow pace (the first one really is dreadfully slow); and eight for the Viennese. Number 5, Fascination, changes pace in the middle and slows down.Still looking for a geat CD to dance to..."
1,very disappointing,"I ordered this CD when I was trying to find music for my wedding. My fiance and I were looking for a few numbers we could waltz to, which would fall in line with the rest of the stylish swing and jazz music that we had already selected. Unfortunately, this CD was full of the same dorky, schmaltzy stuff that our ballroom instructor played for us. We eventually found a few songs by Bobby Darin that were in waltz tempo, as well as a remake of Moon River by Milla Drumke that was the right mix of sentimental and cool. If you're looking for the kind of music we were looking for, this isn't it. Pure muzak. Boom-ching-ching, boom-ching-ching-- just tragic!"
4,Waltz - good for dance practice,"""Elevator music"" but fine for dance practice or if you want some decent background music. Pretty good band."
5,Excellent wrenches,"The Allen wrenches are well made and come in an excellent assortment of sizes. The balldriver tip and long shaft make these wrenches particularly suited for hard-to-reach areas.I have not used the Torx wrenches, as I already have a set. The handle that the torx wrenches fold into is plastic and feels a little flimsy, but this is a ""bonus set"" and didn't influence my purchase decision."
4,"No 'Rumour,' this is one of Olivia's better efforts.","""The Rumour"" is an overlooked album that came at the end of the singer's lucrative heydays. It has aged surprisingly well and contains Olivia's best work as a songwriter with ""Let's Talk About Tomorrow"" and ""It's Not Heaven."" But the real treat here is the stunning waltz-like ballad ""Walk Through Fire."" Ironically, the title track penned by Elton John (and closest to her typical '80's pop sound), is one of the weakest in a otherwise unique and diverse set of musical styles."
5,You Can't Fight The Livvie,"I love my Livvie and since Australia also has a fondness for the girl, they remastered all of her albums in 1998 and I have been listening to the gems since then. Now I have finally bought the ones I want and was more than excited to get this 1988 album.Known primarily for the title track co-written by Elton John, this was not a huge success for ONJ, but that is only in sales because this is probably her best album ever. Co-writing most of the album, Livvie tackles divorce in ""It's Not Heaven"", a sort of letter to her daughter, AIDS in ""Love and Let Live"", the rain forest and pollution in ""Let's Talk About Tomorrow"", sexual politics in ""Get Out"" and she ends it all with the terribly catchy ""Tutta La Vita"" - a little rhumba ish ditty about love and success where ""It's not a mansion in Malibu/ or a face lift at forty/ you can't get there by a car/ not even your BMW""... if you find a used copy of this sucker, you buy it - Livvie and I both would want it that way."
4,"As always, one of the best female singers around.","Olivia is ever changing but maintains a great sound. This CD never received the credit it deserved but, Olivia has never received the respect that she deserves and has more than earned."
3,"OK, but not her best","The Rumour was a pretty well done album. It wasn't Olivia's best work, but it wasn't her worst either. My favorite songs include the title track- The Rumour, It's not Heaven, Walk through Fire, and Tutta la Vitta."
5,Soft in an age of noise,"This is a great CD. It brings in shades of The Moody Blues blended with Blood, Sweat, and Tears...a wonderful combination. The sound is polished yet inventive."
3,"Not actually ""surround sound"" at all!","The description is grossly misleading - it advertises this product as producing ""surround sound,"" which IMPLIES that it has 5 or more speakers; rather, the chair has only TWO speakers (producing STEREO sound, not ""Surround"" sound) and it uses some of the same 3d-audio tricks used by other products to ""simulate"" surround sound. For $500+ this is NOT a great deal."
3,Cobra Ballet Slippers,"I was fairly pleased with this product. I had not tried ANY canvas Ballet Shoe. The shoe was as it represented itself to be, and I am glad I tried it."
4,Good Platinum Solitare Setting,"I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting, but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side, which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold, but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However, rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger."
1,The Biggest Disappointment,"With pictures all over the CD I was led to believe that at least minimal effort would have gone into including at least some of the illustrations from Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks. Not one illustration is included on the CD let alone the complete works. :( While having the footnotes is potentially useful for scholars, having the illustrations would have been far better.The product description needs to be re-written to include the fact that this is a text only presentation and thus not as complete as the title leads one to believe. In fact, the title should be properly revised as well because it is deceptive."
3,Volume 1 is ok. Volume is NO (if you are an artist)!,"I was hoping that after getting these books, I would learn some secret in art making from the great one, but I found them book very disappointing. Tons of texts and very few explanation.However, the first volume is worth buying because it's about his drawing and painting theory. Beware they are very advance and i found them very confusing.The second volume has nothing to do with art but rather pure science (Astronamy, sun, etc)."
3,"ok, worth it cuz its cheap","This book is worth the money 'cuz its so cheap. The reproducions arent really that good, and there are some problems of provenance: the cover drawing attributed to Leonardo, but it is by his master/teacher Verrocchio."
2,a 2 Mb pdf,"this cd simply has a 2Mb pdf on it with 800+ pages of text.It is a useful compendium of his works, but has NO images."
2,"Plain text, no Pics",I was hoping to see the drawings and sketches from Leonardo. Instead I found a cd with a bunch of translated text on it. There are better options out there.
1,WARNING: This book is entirely text.,"WARNING: This book is entirely text. Not a single image from the notebooks, or an illustration or picture of any kind."
1,The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci,I do not see anywhere that this a pdf file with no pictures. There are pictures all over the cd. This is a rip-off.
2,Not Great,"Inexpensive, but the image quality is terrible, in some cases completely illegible and dark, like poor xeroxes...thus, it's nearly impossible to read or make out details of technical drawibngs."
2,Buy it only for the photos - otherwise don't waste your time,"Matthew Brady's photos are fabulous, but the ""history"" by Benson Lossing is dreadful at best. It's evident that Lossing was a rabid Union sympathizer and not a soldier, and that he only interviewed high-ranking Unionists after the war for his ""research."" Among the phony jewels: Lincoln's assassination was a massive plot led by Jefferson Davis; Union prisoners of war were deliberately mistreated while Confederates were well-fed and housed by their captors; Jefferson Davis was gently treated after his arrested and housed in (quote) comfortable quarters during his captivity instead of the rancid, wet cell that Northern and Southern people alike criticized; no atrocities were ever committed by Union generals such as Sherman. Don't even think of using this for your book report!"
3,No Index,"The most annoying this about this collection is the lack of index, which turned out to be incredibly annoying."
4,Suspenseful,"I found this to be a very suspenseful novel, if you can take away all the clothing descriptions and inequality issues. I found the story line fun and I enjoy seeing Emily and Charlotte getting along. I think Emily could be a really good society sluth since she can think so well with them. As usual Thomas goes along and slowing but surely puts the pieces together. I knew though that Charlotte was going to be the one to solve it, either deducing it or being a potential victim. I did not like the way the book just drops you at the end. I needed just a little bit more. But on the whole it was a good read."
3,Victorian Mystery,"Charlotte and Thomas Pitt are back investigating murder. This time a young woman has been raped and murdered in Paragon Walk, a fashionable London street that happens to be home to Charlotte's sister Emily. Charlotte and Emily decide to investigate. As Charlotte has married down and become a policeman's wife, Emily will have to dress Charlotte back up as the fashionable lady she once was.This book seemed to be more social interaction and less crime-solving. Charlotte and Emily spend most of their time attending social functions and gossiping. It seems that Perry really wanted to spend more time commenting on social life and customs than to write a mystery. Undoubtedly the bitchy social interaction is amusing. It's a backstabbing, every woman for herself arena, where Victorian manners and their transgressions are on full display. Still, I really wanted more mystery. I hope Perry returns to more mystery in the next volume of the series."
3,not her best,"I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed. I too will continue to read the rest of the series, because I really enjoyed Cater Street Hangman, the first in this series. I found that this was just hot as interesting as the first two books in this series. Neither was it as good as the one Monk book that I have read, which introduced me to Anne Perry's writing and made me want to read more."
3,"Interesting history, but boring relationships","If you like historical details, and want to know about Victorian London, manners and mores, this is the book for you. If you like full drawn characters that you can relate to, I'd skip these. I love serials, and bought the first four. I wish I'd only bought the first two. When I got to the second book, Callander Square, there was nothing about the courtship or wedding, or the relationship. Anne Perry keeps telling me that Charlotte is independent, but I really only have her word for that, as marrying Thomas ""beneath her station"" seems to be the only independent thought she has. I'm disappointedin the characters, or lack of same, and disagree with other reviews that the writing is good. It is adequate. The mysteries are OK."
2,highly dissapointing,"The problem is, this is probably a very good book if you want to read about Victorian hypocrisy and society codes, but as mysteries go, it's bad.The Monk series,however are very good,the Pitt- Charlotte series have no plot to speak of, and it gets booooring to read for the nth time about Pitt's compassion and societies'trivia. I'm sorry I bought it,fortunately,I bought more Monk books"
2,Poor quality reproduction of a favorite,"Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much higher."
5,Silent Night CD,"This album is so beautiful, I play it every morning, what up lifting music for the holidays. Just beautiful."
5,the best Shania yet.,If you like Shania you will love this DVD. I have watched the VHS version 20+ times and it sounds great but the picture on the DVD makes it even better. You can listen without the picture or watch her without the sound. Either way you should get this DVD.
5,Shania Shines,"This dvd is phenomenal and the sound quality is good. The center channel works on my SONY system, maybe that's the difference. This dvd shows the versatility of Shania as being a truly amorous star. This concert packed the Reunion Arena in Dallas Texas (capacity 18,000). Two hours of sheer entertainment makes this a ""must buy"" dvd."
3,"Great video, but a lackluster dvd.","While I may be one of her biggest fans, I am also a very big fan of DVD. The footage of this movie is awesome and it's something every Shania fan should check out, but for a dvd it could have been so much more. They should have really taken thier time to add special features and 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio. That would make it worth the extra bucks over VHS."
2,Great Video Lousy Audio,She gives a great performance in this but the crowd noise over powers her voice.Also there is no sound from the center channel.I suggest you buy this in the VHS format it sounds much better.
5,Great DVD,Great sound like a real concert. 2 sound tracks to choose from - PCM or 2 + 2 Dolby Digital. 2 full hours of best Shania's songs - so much that this takes a dual layers DVD to hold everything. Good value.
2,"Shania - 'Come On', don't forget your fans","Saw Shania on her recent European Tour and was amazed - a great show, which is why i am disappointed by this DVD Live Concert - the picture quality and sound should be so much better and with no additional DVD extras feel that they have just rushed this release to cash in on her success. Although despite these problems it is great to hear live versions of ""You Win My Love"", ""If It Dont Take Two"", ""Don't Be Stupid"" and ""(If You're Not In It For Love)"". Perhaps they should take a look at the quality and additions of the James Taylor at Beacon Theatre DVD for tips!"
2,"No center channel, so NO Shania voice !","The quality of sound is VERY BAD, because the center channel is missing ! It's not Dolby Digital 5.1 but Dolby Digital 4.1 where the center channel ( containing the Shania voice) has been ""forgotten"". So her voice is too low and very hard to listen ! Send tomatoes for the audio production of this DVD ! Ask for exchange for a 5.1 version, WITH Shania voice ! The quality of the image is excellent, with nice contrasts."
2,MIXED REVIEW,IT IS A GOOD CONCERT OVERALL. THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GOOD. THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY WEAK. NEEDS TO BE MIXED WITH 5.1 CHANNELS OR DTS.
3,"Man, I feel like a - - -","I sure thought they would pull out all the stops on this one, best sound, image etc. So much for the sound part. Still a pretty good disk though."
1,josie and the pussy cats,remember saturday morning cartoons...this is what this video reminds me of...she was good at one time...but since she has become to commercialized and overrated...cant wait for the dixie chicks video to come out!!!!!!!
2,Don't waste your money ! .,"As mentioned by some earlier reviews, the sound mix is totally dissapointing. Shania's voice is entirely covered by the band.I wish I had paid attention to some of the other reviewers."
2,Shania Twain - Live,"I read the other reviews proir to renting this concert. I am sad to say that I was dissapointed. I do not doubt that Shania is a very talented performer. In my opinion, this was not one of Shania's best efforts. Furthermore, the sound was not mixed well for this concert. I have rented (and own) several concerts, and this one has below average sound quality. This show comes off as not being ""the big time"". We all are aware that by this time in Shania's career (1999) that she had already hit ""the big time"". Shania does not do much to make this show very entertaining. The weave she is donning with her hair completely takes away from her looks that everyone knows her for. I do not think that there was any costume changes throughout the entire show. This is NOT a terrible concert, although, if you are expecting something impressive from this concert just because Shania is a superstar and her music is very entertaining, you might feel that this concert is a bit of a letdown."
5,EXCELLENT BUT I CAN'T OWN IT!!!,It's a shame so few of the videos are offered in PAL VHS format so that we can buy them to play in Europe.
4,This is an awesome concert from Shania and her band,I was at the concert in Dallas where this was filmed. It is almost like being there again. I have had the video for a week and have seen it five times. Shania is awesome but her band is also very good and very talented
5,she's great love to see her sing and watch her videos,"I saw Shania in concert in B'ham Al she was great wish I could see her again I have all three cd's behind the music tape,live in concert, also her video tape of the woman in me she brings more fans to country music"
1,no center channel track,I have played this DVD all weekend. I found that the DVD has no center channel. So you get no direct vocals from Shania. All you hear is the by-products of her vocals on the side channels. That's what makes the sound dissapointing.I hope I can return it.
3,"Good insight into a ""live"" Shania show","If you've been to one of Shanias concerts over the last year and half, this is a great reminder of what a great night it was. This video shows her concert in Dallas, which was exactly the same format followed in the Shania concert I went to in Dublin. It's not quite the same as the real thing, and I thought the atmosphere was a little more subdued in Dallas than in Dublin, but nevertheless, its definitely one for the collection."
4,Great book to understand Statistics!,"Another fine book by Schaum's outline. For anyone who has lost touch with the world of statistics, this book is a must read. It has clear definitions, examples and complicated explanations if you wish to dig deeper. I recommend this book to all college students, undergraduate and even MBA students. For financial analysis, marketing, and social research, this book is wonderful."
5,The Birds of Canada,"I saw this book at a wildlife camp I went to and I thought it would make a great addition to my collection.Revised edition containing 660 pages, 74 full color and magnificent plates illustrated by John A. Crosby, and hundreds of line drawings.This book was and excellent purchase, arriving shortly after purchase, well wrapped and in beautiful condition. This book is a must have for any bird fancier or ornithologist."
4,classic science fiction,"This was the very first science fiction book I read in my life, at age 10 or 11 or so. I still have it and pull it out every few years to get some easy to read classic sci fi, and a feeling of nostalgia. Nice simple, straightforward story."
3,Not bad for what it is,"There's some good music on here, performed well. I like that there's a cross-section of liturgical and folk songs. It's got a very Russian, rich texture.The songs are mostly ""folk ensemble stanbys"" - The Volga Boatmen, Stenka Razin, Kalinka . . ., so the title baffles me a bit. Only one or two of the songs could be called ""Cossack"" by any stretch of the imagination. Neither are they from the Urals.For real Cossack music, which is unique and very powerful, look for Kazachii Krug, Bratina, or the Kuban Cossack Chorus. They're hard to find, but definitely worth it. Enjoy this one as an inexpensive sampler of popular russian folk and sacred music."
3,Too many dirges,"The voices are great, of course, but there's very little of the rousing boisterousness I like in Russian chorus music. I guess I'm more of an 'Army Chorus' fan."
4,A band that deserves more attention,"Babe Ruth, for some reason, had a following in Dayton, Ohio, in the early 70s. I saw them perform live on at least two occasions at Hara Arena, in Dayton, when I lived there. Those remain two of the most memorable concerts of my youth. Jenny Haan was not only an exciting performer to watch (acrobatic almost--a female Mick Jagger), but also a fine vocalist. At times she is every bit as powerful as Janis Joplin. The band was tight and offered an interesting variety of sounds. I recently picked up an old LP copy of this at a garage sale, replacing the one I bought new years ago. The music holds up well after all these years. This is a band that deserves more recognition, in my view."
3,Somewhat overpriced,"The book is OK, though overpriced. I mean, it use good quality paper, but you can buy a book with one hundred puzzles, printed in a cheaper paper, with the same quality of puzzles, for about fifty cents, in the stand of your local super market (not all of them would be as challenging, but some will)."
4,addictive samurai sudoku puzzles,"My husband & I really enjoy these puzzles, so about the only way they could be better is if there were about 10 times more of them. This is a nice size puzzle book for travel, etc."
4,good book.,"I found this book to be really fun. I bought it for my boyfriend's birthday, and we ended up altenating on the puzzles. The puzzles seemed a little too easy for both of us, so I purchased another similar book, with better results. On the whole, if you enjoy regular sudoku, but feel ready for a new challenge, this book may be just the right fit. If you have already gotten into samurai sudoku, the book may be too easy."
2,Fun if you're not blind,"The way they have it set up, it's really hard to differentiate between the middle and the end sections. Also, the print is very small so if you have trouble seeing this is no the sudoku book for you. Also, I was expecting a challenge but finished the hardest puzzles in the book very quickly. Good for beginners, but not someone who's already gone through another Samurai Sudoku book."
3,It's the same challenge level,"I love Samurai Sudoku's! I have been spending money at the grocery store for a year now to buy a book that only has a handful in it. I was so pleased to run across this whole book of Samurai puzzles! It is good and all, but the puzzles do not increases in difficultly. They are all basically at the beginner level and not challenging for someone who has done loads of Samurai's in the past."
4,Excellent Laptop,"I've thoroughly used this bag for almost a year and a half and have had nothing but a great experience. Please don't pay attention to the person who said this bag is made out of cheap material. She hurt her own credibility by stating that she just got the bag, how can you make a decision on the quality and how long it will last if you haven't used it?I've commutted to law school everyday with this bag filled with large books and my laptop for a long time now and have been rewarded with a quality bag.Only cons are the weak padding and the fact that the CD player apocket is not protected to kep water from getting through the zipper.Highly recommended."
5,Don't miss it.,"Rarely one comes across a book that moves one's emotion and intellect with it's powerful yet beautiful and extremely poignant language. The story effortlessly moves back and forth in time, portraying the contrast of the times and places of the two stages of the protagonist's life, beautifully bringning the evolution of a character in particular and humanity in general. The characters of this story are too real to be fictitious, who are all very complex and yet simple enough to be idnetifiable with our own experiences. The climax is amazing, unpredictable, and very touching, living fully upto the expectations raised in the building up of it, and more. It leaves the reader with a twich of nostalgia that one feels after coming across a beautiful creation. DON'T MISS IT."
2,Taught Disappointment,"The star rating is insufficient here. I taught this text to college sophomores recently and realized too late just how difficult the text is. True, there are marvelous complexities and wonderfully wrought ironies and historical insights. But there are also pages of confusion with relatively little pay off. This text might well be taught in conjunction with a detailed Indian (or Pakistani or Bangladeshi) history. Without it (and without an immense amount of time), this book is better left for graduate study.That said, I will repeat what others have said ad nauseam: there is a large amount of difference between enjoyment and appreciation. Some of Mr. Ghosh's work is indeed remarkably worth appreciating; it is sometimes less than enjoyable. As a result, I'd leave it for more advanced courses than the one I taught."
3,Not upto par,"I wanted to read this book as it was being praised as a 'great partition novel' and I had previously read a couple of novels set during the independence of bangladesh. However, this book turned out to be more of a love story, with very little mention of the partition of Bangladesh almost till the very end. However for the most part, it's a well written novel."
3,It was dull!,"This a story about young man's family saga that takes place in Calcutta, India. The author Ghosh's narration goes back and forth. The young man has cousin by the name of Tridib that is a kind of a ""loner"" in my opinion. Tridib who teachs the young man to look beyond the comfort of what knows to imagine the world outside of India. The author Ghosh should have put a dictionary of the indian words that appeared at the end of the book, because I had some trouble understanding what some of those indian words meant. This was my first Ghosh book and it could possibly be my last."
2,Didnt finish it,I have read several of Ghosh's books but this one was a disappointment. I tried several times to pick it up and continue but finally just let it go. It is the story of a Bengali family during the partition but the book wanders. There is alot of character development and some very interesting characters that you can visualize. I am not sure there was a plot. I am waiting for the third of the Ibis trilogy to be released and can recommend several other Ghosh books.
4,This author is wonderful,"I've read other books by this author and I especially loved the Sea of Poppies Trilogy. I liked The Shadow Lines, but he has done something that I have never seen in another book. He goes back and forth in time - in the same paragraph, just the way a person thinks with one thought hinging on something that happened before. I'm sorry to say that I didn't figure it out for a long time and was just confused. So, this wasn't my favorite of his books, but I can't wait to read anything he writes."
5,One to seek out,"Nicely written, and I felt the story makes its point in a subtle and gentle way.Regardless of the path the story takes, there is a great level of authenticity at all times.Recommended to me by a good friend, and I now recommend it to you."
4,reindeer,I liked this reindeer alot. Just wish it was lit on both sides. It was easy to hang up and easy to connect.
5,Very highly recommended as an enduringly popular addition to community library DVD collections,"When Willie and his parents move into a new house the youngster is convinced that the place fairly lurks with evil aliens from outer space who are going to do him harm. Willie wants desperately for someone to save him. That's when Gooby shows up. A big, loveable, scruffy creature (who may just be as frightened of the world as Willie is of space aliens) to provide comfort and companionship to a beleaguered young boy. ""Gooby"" is a fully featured theatrical production starring Matthew Knight as Willie and Robbie Coltrane as the voice of Gooby. This flawless DVD edition of a thoroughly entertaining family movie has a total running time of 99 minutes and is very highly recommended as an enduringly popular addition to community library DVD collections."
4,like it,on time when said it would be. the price was good and disk worked like it said. everything was as said
1,completely dumb,"horrible movie. the only good thing about movie is the dad from american pie plays the elementary school teacher. i was tempted to actually buy this, than found it on netflix. so glad i didnt buy it."
2,Gooby not worth it.,"Ok, first off, he's not a monster, although he's billed as one. Everywhere I have seen Gooby described, the word ""monster"" is used, but he is just a very large teddy bear. My children were expecting a monster and got an oversized stuff animal. I disliked how lots of the situations were handled and also thought the ending was unsatisfactory. I just wasn't happy with this one."
5,Gooby,"I would recommend this movie for parents of young children, my daughter & I discovered this movie on demand & she loves it."
1,Gooby gone wild...,Gooby was ghetto...enough said. A Definite must skip film. I know what somebody's getting as their white elephant this year!
2,AbraKfox,"It contains a few good tricks and illusions; but, it also has a lot of ""fluff"" stories about Kerrell Fox himself. It is sort of an autobiography with some of his illusions thrown in."
5,sensual,"Darkly moody and evocative of the city of New Orleans,this CD is a strange and sensual journey into the passions of that place.As the themes of Schrader's film show:they are sex,death,sacrifice and passionate sensual love..."
4,cat people original soundtrack,"A work of Giorgio Moroder creating great weather-related film. Includes a song by David Bowie. For fans of Moroder or soundtracks, recommended."
1,Classic album--wretched mix--avoid like the plague!,"One of Gentle Giant's best, but do yourself a favor. Get the release which contains both Freehand and Interview instead of the One-Way label version (Interview is also very worthwhile.)"
3,"Gentle,gentle Giant","This is good, but seems a little too laid back,some of their other works seem more interesting to me."
5,Item evaporation results in no review,"I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM YET, ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN OVER A MONTH NOW SINCE I ORDERED IT ALONG WITH ANOTHER CD WHICH ARRIVED SAFELY. I would definitely like to review 'Free Hand' which has to be one of my top 3 favourite Gentle Giant albums, but, unfortunately, i do not think it's the right thing to do before I get it. Sorry when I don't have to be....... Still waiting......."
4,"Is ""fugue"" a rock term?","Listen to ""On Reflection""--you'd swear it was. The song's contapuntal a capella, just like a Bach choral anthem, only this is just 4 or 5 guys! It takes a tight vocal ensemble to be able to go more than halfway through a song without touching their instruments. ""Last Voyage"" has a piano break section that shows somebody was listening to Brubeck. ""Talybont"" conjures up knights and damsels with its woodwinds and harpsichord. Half the fun of the opener ""Just the Same"" is figuring out the rhythm. Listen to the first few seconds of ""Time To Kill"" and you can hear an old '70s-era electronic hockey game: pre-Atari, much less Sega. It's a good thing that they didn't take this album's title from that of the first song. Ain't no way it's ""just the same""!"
4,Good Recording,"This recording in my opinion signaled the direction the Giant would go. Although this album is still very good, it reveals the poppy more commercial direction the band would take. Not to say don't buy it. I just bought it again after owning the record and I am glad I did. It just lacks some of the more experimental aspects of the earlier works."
5,Takes me back to my childhood,"I have had this collection all my life and have now passed the experience down to my girls. It is an invaluable, enchanting collection of beautiful songs and lullabies. ""Golden Slumbers, A Selection of Lullabies from Near and Far"" is the spiral bound book with record, published in 1956. I have often wondered if I would be able to find it in a more current edition. Now I have! I would also love to see this published in CD format, but for now will enjoy this cassette tremendously!"
1,Useless,I bought this book as a requirement for my class and found this book is useless without the Code to download the software.
1,Meh...,This was the book I needed for a class but it came without the codes I needed and was boring! If you don't have to buy it DON'T! It came as described and on time but I had to buy another one with the codes and this one was tossed...
1,book without code,"the book took a very long time before it came and it came without the code to download the software, of what use is the book without the code?.....i think i am going to return the book...."
5,Absolutely wonderful until it explodes!,"This workbook is completely interactive. Students who have never before been exposed to statistics can get a real sense of what stats are and how they are used. If you are looking for a way to get students ""ready"" to deal with statistical math concepts, or to take the social sciences seriously, this could be it. Things to watch out for: some editing problems that make a few (only in one chapter) of the workbook questions unusable. Also, the CD I had was produced in such a manner that after repeated use it ""fragmented"" --that is, exploded inside my CD drive into about a zillion pieces. Dust. It was great before it exploded."
1,Strictly Ballroom! Help!,This is firmly in the Strictly Ballroom genre with the measured tempo and lack of passion/sensuality associated with that style.
1,Warning ! no tango music here!,"I have listened to the CD and Tango, beintg part of my heritage, I can honestly say that any one that buys this record to listen to tango music is wasting his or hers money."
2,"Good idea, bad execution...","This book has a wonderful premise, a circus train pulls into a small town, and proceeds to terrorize the town.I was going to write about what was wrong with the book, but in the end, all I'm going to say, is that when I finished reading the book, I was glad I did not have to read it anymore. It's a shame because if this book would have had decent editors it would have been a classic."
3,One More Time,"While the explosive title track is one of the catchiest Euro-pop hits in years, Real McCoy's second LP, One More Time, doesn't quite pack as strong of a punch on the rest of the tracks. ""I Wanna Come (With You)"" and ""Give A Little Love"" are both energetic but marred by clichéd lyricism, as are much of the other songs. Their double-platinum debut, Another Night, successfully mixed R&B vocal stylings with the Berman Brother's brand of upbeat dance-pop, but on One More Time this basic formula spreads itself too thin. There is such a thing as sophomore slump, but more times than not it's due to the artists' and their producers' impulses to re-manufacture the sounds of their first outing."
3,"The Real McCoy, Not Bad At All!","I wasn't sure what to expect buying this album, 'One More Time'. After seeing the band perform the debut single with the same title as the album on 'Regis And Kathie Lee' I figured I'd like it so I'd pick it up! I had heard 'Run Away' before and really enjoyed that. The album was in my stereo 24/7 for the first month but it stayed at the bottom of my collection for a while! Now, that I have rediscovered the energy of Real McCoy again, 2 years later, I can't put it down! It's one of those type albums, ones you can take only in moderations! Notable tracks are 'One More Time', 'Take A Look At Your Love', 'The Sky Is The Limit' and 'Give A Little Love'"
5,Awesome,It has everything that a techno-disco freak can ever want. And the music is just AWESOME. Need I say more?
1,Poo,"Alright, let's be honest, what in the heck is this ? It stinks. I bought the CD and One More Time has a catchy tune but the rest just plain suck. I don't recommend it, but the song One More Time is really catchy and has a good beat."
1,THIS IS A GOOD WANNABE ALBUM,"WITHOUT VOCALS FROM THE REAL VOCALIST 'KARIN KASAR""THIS ALBUM IS JUNKITS NOT WORTH BUYINGWHY DO YOU THINK THEY STOP SELLING ITRAN OUT OF RECORDSNO WAYMORE LIKE RAN OUT OF BUYERS"
4,"If You Love B-Rated Movies, This Is A Must Own!","Come on guys, since when did B-rated movies ever really become Oscar worthy. The gold hidden in these kinds of movies is the fun you get out of them, and this movie is full of it. I've been a fan of this movie almost as long as it has been released. Sbarge does a great job as the hero in the film. The villianess of the film does a great job as well, who in reality is the mother of Dern in Jurassic Park.The dinosaur effects are cheesy, but you gotta love it anyway. This movie is pretty gorey, so I wouldn't recommend show this film to a young one unless they are used to seeing people's heads being bitten off. Overall a fun film with a sad ending, which is always my favorite kind of ending in a horror movie. If you love dinosaurs, get it, not because it is worthy of film of the decade, but because it is pure fun and that's all that really matters."
2,Rubber dinosaurs on the loose.,"An embittered scientist starts breeding dinosaurs in an attempt to wipe out the human race and return the planet to the age of wonders.Pity there's no wonder or awe surrounding the dinosaurs in this film. True, there are a few comic moments involving some of the human characters, but the whole thing has a very 'stalk-and-slash movie' feel about it. Not that it's recommended to fans of Friday 13th-type films, as the gore isn't even convincing.But what really lets the whole thing down is the poor quality of the dinosaurs. Cheap, rubbery creations which are too ridiculous to be frightening. A rubber Raptor even laughs at one point - anything to stay sane whilst appearing in a film of this poor quality, I suppose.Apparently there are two sequels. Why?"
5,2 of the worlds most dangerous speicies,"i rented this a lot when i was a little kid cause i was a die hard dino fanatic!just now i am realizing how many fake effects it takes to screw in a light bulb.this review is short cause i can't remember the entire story,but to make a long story short,i'm just gonna say this,the dino effects are cheap,just the way i like'em."
3,one of those little low-budget movies that could,"This is a Roger Corman rip-off of Jurassic Park but they worked damn hard in the claymation and firework special effects department. Actually, it is one of those little low-budget movies that could, pulling off some tension before its workable dinosaur-gnawing-humans moments. The mother of Laura Dern is featured in this one, and she has some kind of maniacal plan to have dinosaurs over-run us humans. One spewing and gushing scene has the birth of Little Dino from Momma Human."
4,Pretty Good Movie if you think about it,this movie is good. it's good enough for me. i own the dvd of this movie. the plot is good. it's about a baby t-rex that goes on a rampage and eat's the ... out of people. the special effects aren't very good but i guess Roger Corman thinks their good. this movie needes to be in every store so people well buy it more. this movie is not for children. if you think it's okay for your kids think again. it has lots of blood pouring out of people necks and mouths. people get hands riped off and heads biten of and even more worse things. but it acually is a very good movie.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made!,"This stinker is the worst of the worst in bad B horror. The Dinosaurs do not stay in any kind of scale, jumping from large to medium sizes and back indescriminatley. The acting is very bad. A stage is obviously used for a scene in which a sheriff fights a small man sized Dino (maybe a Raptor - but in this movie it was just as likely T-Rex).The roads in this scene are black with no curbs.But the worst part of the movie occurs when a woman chained to a big construction machine is attacked by one of the Dinos, if you pause the movie and go through the action frame by frame you can see that the woman is being shaken by a human hand, not a Dino at all.I have liked several Roger Corman classics, B movies that are bad, but fun to watch anyway. I can not reccomend Carnosaur to anyone."
1,Is this supposed to be scary?,"Always be wary of films which claim to be better than some box-office hit or other.This cash-in on Jurassic Park bears no resemblance in the slightest to Harry Adam Knight's brilliant novel Carnosaur. So why bother getting copyright in the first place?The ideas behind this film are vaguely interesting and there is some good scenery, but what lets it all down are some of the most laughable, unconvincing dinosaurs I've ever had the misfortune to waste my time watching. The creatures in the silent 1925 Lost World are far better than these pathetic creations. So much for progress.Do yourself a huge favour and watch Jurassic Park instead. Or failing that, Barney. He's a far more convincing dinosaur than the rubber abominations in the complete turkey that is Carnosaur. If the sequels are as bad as this I don't think I'll bother with them."
3,"Another ""The End OF The World"" movie.","Low budget little film about a crazy scientist, Diana Ladd, who alters chicken eggs so that human females can give birth to ... dinasaurs. Watchable & funny."
1,Wasted Potential,"This film has good potiental and tries really hard to get you to like the movie. However, without a budget to supply for special effects or acting, your left with a shallow, uninteresting flick."
1,By far the worst movie ever made about dinosaurs!,"Everything about this movie is just plain wrong. The dinosaurs are unconvicing, the plot is ludicrous, the gore is outrageous, and there is no respect or panache given to it's subject. These dinosaurs aren't even treated with awe. Instead, they are simply unkillable monsters who's sole purpose is to destroy the human race. Jurassic Park is the Dinosaur movie of 1993 to see. Jurassic Park. Not Carnosaur."
1,This film was rediculus,The acting was fair but the speacial dinosaur effects were terrible! this was one of the worst movies i had ever seen
1,There must be a better makeup mirror,"This makeup mirror looks good but it does not last. In one year, mine rusted and the base fell off although I took care to keep it dry and clean. Replacing the bulb made me say many bad words. I would give it no stars if I could."
1,Died in less than 3 months,Nice looking mirror. Great glass. Magnification works great. I purchased this Nov 20th 2012 as of 2/8/2013 it will not come on. Can't return it. I don't want to buy a new bulb only to find out that it isn't the bulb it is the switch or a broken wire. Frankly I think a switch or wire in more likely the problem. Florescent bulbs last many years. I don't normally write reviews but this item is on the fence and it seems recent productions are of inferior quality.
4,Great Mirror,Nice mirror for the money. Almost double in the big box retailer stores. You definately see it all on the mag side!!
3,Very Nice,"This cook book was old, but in very good condition. The Pillsbury Company must have put out several versions of the same cook book. I have one with the same cover in a spiral bound, hard cover book, which is what I thought was getting. This was a hard bound book with most of the recipes in it, but many of the pages from the spiral bound cook book were missing. It is still nicer than the spiral bound book I have, which is falling apart. I would recommend it, if you need a cook book in better shape than the one you have."
2,This is not a book for unvieling mysteries,"This is not the book that unviels mysterees. The ritual moniter also available from this publisher details initiations and preperations. this book is not for that. most people will be more interest4ed in the accompanying catolog. however for those not looking for more secret words and genuinly interested in the search, this books stands by itself. this is geared towards those trying to smooth the proverbial stone. Atleast i thought the chapter on the square was well rounded! i would recomend this book to any one interested in the afore mentioned subjects. it is displayed in dissertation and poetry. the real strength of this book ist its symbolism and the gained perspective in the end."
5,The ultimate classic,"Until I saw Citizen Kane I didn't understand what all the fuss was about - a movie about a search for the meaning of a man's last words the greatest movie of all time? Luckily, I did see Citizen Kane in school, and boy was I surprised. It truly is a cinematic masterpiece. The story is a sad yet realistic and moving tale of a man unable to fill the void of his empty life, torn apart by the money he never wanted. Now I finally understand what the fuss was about, and hopefully you will too."
5,WOW!,"Never thought that much of Citizen Kane, being a teen, but recently HBO aired a drama of the making of Citizen Kane called ""RKO281"" it starred Liev Schreiber, John Malkovich, Melanie Griffith, James Cromwell and Rob Scheider. This movie made me want to see Kane, so I did. And I have to say, when it started out I thought it was stupid. But I kept at it. And it's a touching, moving story of a man. It's a wonderful film, and for 1942, that makes it even more brilliant, I can image what people thought when it came out. It was WAY ahead of their time. It's wonderful, just see it."
5,The classic example of extraordinary American cinema.,"This film is timeless and one that all students of cinema should study. The first time the film is viewed, it makes an impact. The second time, one realizes that one missed a variety of key elements in the film. On third viewing, the film hits you - you realize all that it says and doesn't say. Moreover, the knowledge of what Welles went through to produce and, eventually, screen the film, is astounding and hard to believe for today's film student. This is a movie that can be watched repeatedly and each time, something different is seen and, more importantly at times, felt. Don't miss an opportunity to see ""Citizen Kane"" on the ""big"" screen, if you ever have the chance. It's a knockout."
5,see it for yourself,"What is there to say after 500+ reviews? Just that you owe it to yourself to see this one. Like The Great Gatsby, it's an essential piece of American culture, with pointed insights about the American dream. It's also a spectacular example of imaginative filmmaking. But see for yourself. Some people, like me, have even watched it more than a dozen times, with growing admiration at every screening."
5,The best,"Anyone giving this film less than 5 stars is demonstrating their ignorance. This masterpiece should be watched carefully by anyone who thinks they ""know"" movies. The reality, much too often, is that people only see the latest postmodernism films that pale in comparison to this work. One may not enjoy this movie, but one cannot deny it is a masterpiece. Personal taste and criticism are very different things."
5,This is not a widescreen movie.,"This is for the person who is still waiting for Warner Brothers (the ""philistines"" according to you) to stop ""being colossally stupid and actually release the entire film."" This is it, buddy. This DVD is, in fact, presented in the correct aspect ratio. It is not pan & scan, nor did they, as you so eloquently put it, chop ""half or more of the film off before releasing it!"" Take a deep breath and enjoy."
5,Outstanding Print & Commentaries,"Without venturing into the debate as to whether this is the greatest film of all time (which is of course a matter of personal taste -- what is undeniable is that the film has enormous historical importance), I would like to advise prospective buyers that this 2-DVD package is an excellent buy. The print, as other reviewers have noted, is remarkably crisp and clear -- this release is comparable to some of the better Criterion releases. Also, I found the commentaries to be quite interesting. Robert Ebert's commentary was as good as any I have seen, to my considerable surprise. The included documentary is also quite good. The other special features were well-executed if somewhat superfluous.If you are going to purchase this film, to my knowledge this is the best available release and I highly recommend it."
2,Citizen Kane deserves all negative comments.,"I kind of agree with all negative reviews about Citizen Kane. However, it is not the worst film ever made like many people say. It may not be a good film but I give credits for the attempts they try to make this boring film look like a masterpiece. It fails in every aspect."
1,This movie was boring!,"We had to watch this movie for a writing on film class. I tried to watch it 3 times. However, I didn't see the entire movie. It was just too boring and dark. I fell asleep. I don't understand why it is called the greatest movie of all time."
2,One of the worst movies,"I'd heard so much about this movie that I finally bought it when it came out on this special DVD edition. Boy was I disappointed. The movie, supposedly based on the true-life news tycoon Hearst, is truly boring. While technically it has a lot of merits -- the editing, the cinematography, the make-ups -- the story itself is really difficult to follow. I paused the movie numerous times, because it was painful to go on watching it.After finally finishing the entire movie, I took out a few books on movies and read the relevant chapters on Citizen Kane. Of course they all sang high praises to the film. Then I watched it again, this time looking for the ""classic"" moments as described in the books, but once again I found the film disorienting and painful to watch.If you've never seen this movie, you may want to rent it first to see if you can stand it. If you like it, you may consider the DVD edition with an extra DVD on how the movie was made (an equally boring documentary)."
1,soilent green is people! it's people!,I don't understand this movie. WHy should we care if they're eating people? They're probably only the dregs of society anyway the bums and the welfare mothers. if they're not doing anything they might as well be eaten.
1,Laughable as the Greatest Film in American History!!,"This review will be short and sweet. Adding nothing new to the one star reviews, I simply say I laughed when this film was chosen as the greatest film in American History!"
1,Awful,This is probably the most over rated movie ever.It is boring and depressing.The only thing it is good at depicting is how much of an ego maniac idiot Orson Welles was.
1,This movie blows!,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't tell you enough how much it disgusts me when I hear these ""Hollywood Buffs"" saying that this is the greatest movie of all time. What a joke, get a clue! Camera angles and ""deep focus photograpy"" don't make a movie good. The plot is what makes a movie good, and the plot to Citizen Kane was absolutely terrible. If you want to know what the best movie of all time is, it's Top Gun."
1,What movie could be worse than this?,"I really can't imagine if there is any film that is more boring than Citizen Kane, what would it be like? It's a real torture to sit through this movie. I absolutely hate it."
1,How Good Can The Blu-Ray Be? There's No Camera Negative.,"i have read on numerous occasions that the camera negative forCITIZEN KANE no longer exists. my point being with ""older"" filmsunless the camera negative exists don't bother issuing a blu-raydisc. look what happened to KING KONG(1933). the blu-ray disc issuedlast Sept. 2010 by Warner Bros. Home Video was not mastered fromthe camera negative which no longer exists but from the best qualityprint they could find. while it was the best the film had looked andsounded on home video there were wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to manyscenes that may me go-""this is a blu-ray disc?"". so i don't have highhopes for the blu-ray disc of CITIZEN KANE."
1,AFI GOT IT WRONG AND SO DID THE REST OF THEM!!,Maybe on the list of the ten worst pictures...but the best????Only for brainies out there. I'm a little more down to earth than this.
1,SO OVERRATED,It is so overrated. If you can stay awake long enough to sit through it in one sitting I applaud you!
2,It's alright.,"I watch movies on the surface as they were and are intended. If I want to look deeply into something I read a book. This movie is moderately entertaining though. You do need some intelligence and patience to watch it, as it does drag on in parts of the movie. I think what this movie needed was some twist at the end. Don't we feel ultimately cheated at the conclusion, when we discover that rosebud was a sled? Who cares? Maybe I missed some deep rooted meaning to the big mystery that is rosebud. Sorry! Anyone who saw this film without preconceived notions as I did, wouldn't say, ""Oh my God its the sled, rosebud is the sled"". They would groan and say as I did; ""oh...It's the sled"". Once is enough, It's not a movie I could watch again and again as I can with a Hitchcock film."
2,"no film snob here, but neither do I care for Star Wars","Am I the only one? I don't care about Kane, his life, or his sled. Get it? The character did not interest me. Period.You want to call this ""the greatest film ever made?"" Go right ahead. Only it means zip to this viewer. I can think of a few other films that worked way better (for me.)"
2,Not No.1 !,"I don't understand why this movie was voted to be No. 1 of all times! It's not special in any way - plot, actors, photography. Just an old movie!"
3,Many other movies are much better,This movie just isn't all that interesting and isn't very fun to watch. If you want to see a gret old movie see High Noon or Night of the Hunter.
2,truly boring,i cannot agree more with the previous viewer from moscow. this is truly a boring movie.. i was shocked that this was voted afi number one movie. i have seen this movie twice in my life and could barely make it thru. i guess i just don't get it.. but i have never agreed with the hollywood elites that vote on this kind of thing... how this film ranks number 1 and gone with the wind ranks number four is beyond me... are you crazy?
3,"brilliant film, BUT...","This story shows how no amount of money, fame, and grandiosity can make up for the horror of parental betrayal and stolen childhood. It shows the roots and consequences of narcissism, writ large. Kudos to Orson Welles. These points alone make the film an important classic.But:1) The movie, 70 years old, is often slow by modern standards. It wasn't until about halfway through that I started catching on to why so many call it the best movie of all time. But this criticism is not that important, and if it were my only one I'd still give the film five stars.2) My big beef: The film is utterly NON-redemptive. Although it is brilliant in showing the problem, it does absolutely nothing to suggest, let alone show, a solution -- or even a suggestion that a solution is possible. I suspect this is because Orson Welles had no realistic idea of how to heal childhood traumas. For that reason I cannot give the film any more than three stars."
2,uh.... point please?,"Yes, this is a ""great"" movie. No, it does not deserve the tile of best movie ever. I guess Casablanca, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Godfather just don't crack up to all that. W H A T E V E R !!!!!!!!! Citizen Kane is monotonouse and boring. by the end of the movie, you don't even care what ""Rosebud"" means. I'll admit, there is great cinemetography, but it seems forced. like he knew he was breaking bounderies and was trying as hard as he could (self-conciously) to make them better. I am not an ignorant, I love films and appreciate them all. i'm totally open to new types, but, yes,I must agree, Citizen Kane is grossly overrated."
2,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SERIOUS!,"OH MY GOD!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THIS IS, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE GOOD, YOU KNOW?, I COULD PROBABLYMAKE THIS !!!TO ALL THE PEOPLE,WHO JUST LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE 200 YEARS OLD OR SOMETHING, GET A LIFE! AND CHECK OUT SOME GOOD STUFF LIKE GHOST DOG WAYOF THE SAMURAI. OR SOME ARTHOUSE FLICK. SERIOUSLY THOUGH THERE IS MUCH BETTER STUFF TODAY THAN THIS, I MEAN IT IS A GOOD FLICK FOR WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW? BUT LIKE WHAT IT IS A VERY SHALLOW MEANINGLESS FILM ABOUT A SLED, I MEAN IF I WANTED TO BE A SLEDDER OR WATCH SOMETHING ON SLEDS ID RENT OUT COOL RUNNINGS STARRING JOHN CANDY, AT LEAST THAT MADE ME CHUCKLE.SERIOUSLY THOUGH IT IS ALRIGHT, ITS NOT THAT ITS BAD ITS JUST THAT THERES MUCH BETTER STUFF TODAY.CHILL."
4,Where's War Of The Worlds??,"The movie is great, the Blu-ray is beautiful, and the packaging is nice. But Amazon lists two of the special features as being the 10/30/38 Mercury Theatre Broadcast of War of the Worlds (Audio Only)and the 10/28/40 KTSA, San Antonio Broadcast of H.G. Wells Meets Orson Welles (Audio Only). I haven't found them yet. If not for this, it would get 5 stars."
5,This is one of the most brillant movies that has ever been m,"This was really one of the most risk taking films ever made. Orsan Wells went against all odds to get this put into the theater, taking on one of the most powerful men in america. The film was made in 1941 but looks like it could have been made in the 90's. this film will truly stand the test of time."
2,A major disappointment on Blu-ray!,"This must be my first major disappointment for a vintage film transferred to Blu-ray. The presentation is superb of this WB ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" boxed set, BUT the quality of the picture is not nearly as good as my much earlier Region 1 Warner Bros.DVD set! As soon as the RKO logo came up I could see something was wrong. It was rather blurry and grainy as is much of the actual film itself. The DVD is sharp,contrasty and unblemished. In fact it looks like it was filmed yesterday. So what have WB done? Used the wrong print I should think! It does include however, a hardback book, repro of the original souvenir programme and more, but the most important thing, ""the movie"" does certainly not look as it should on Blu-ray. I'm mystified."
2,"A classic, but didn't make it for me","After going to the Hurst Castle, which was Hurst's home in California, we wanted to see his life.Hurst's castle is amazing, with the most eclectic collection of art, antiqity, he just boughteverything he could in Europe and had it built into his home. The museum treats Hurst as a veryspecial man.I know that he had a yellow journalistic and political side. While there is no movie called HurstCitizen Kane is about Hurst, thinly disguised. In spite of my motivation I just could not get intoit. It really did not tell his story. I don't know why it's such a classic.I viewed it downstreaming from Amazon, a great service."
3,Doesn't Make it for Me.,"The only reason I wanted to finish the movie is to get the answer to the mystery of Rosebud. While the film was a decent portrayal of a complex psychological character, I found High Noon more compelling in its complex psychology. While its cinematography was interesting, it didn't rise to the level of, say, Casablanca. In short, I found the movie to be mediocre at best, and I will probably avoid seeing it again."
3,Uncertain What to Make of This Film -,"The film reportedly has some semblance to the life of William Randolph Hearst, and that is the only aspect of it that creates interest - otherwise it would be totally boring. Unfortunately, viewers have no idea what parts might be modeled after Hearst - other than the fact that Kane is a newspaper magnate and lives in a fabulously opulent Xanadu (Hearst Castle)."
2,"The best film EVER?! Oh, please . . .","This was one of the most boring classic films I've ever seen. Is the American Film Institute really saying that ""Citizen Kane"" was a better film than ""Casablanca""? When I first saw ""Casablanca"", I was riveted to the screen at the end. By the end of ""Citizen Kane"", I didn't care who or what Rosebud was. I'm sure that fans of ""The Godfather"" and ""Gone With The Wind"" are just as bewildered by this choice as I am."
4,Not the greatest film ever--but still a good movie,"Following the death of media mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a reporter (Joseph Cotten) is tasked with investigating the significance of Kane's final word: ""Rosebud."" It is impossible to merely enjoy this film because of its reputation as the greatest ever made. I felt like I was forced to react to this exalted status. Well, I have to conclude that it is probably impossible to single out any movie as the best, but if I had to it wouldn't be ""Citizen Kane.""This is not to say that I thought it was a bad movie at all. However, Welles's innovative use of the camera, which causes so many to regard it so highly, was so relentless that I was frequently pulled out of the story to consider the artifice of it, making it feel rather cold and technical. I found the story involving, even though I couldn't really connect with the characters, and would still recommend it."
5,Charles Foster Kane,"the title of ""greatest film of all time"" is thrown around a lot. i don't know if Citizen Kane is it, but this certainly is the greatest DVD i've ever seen. The care that was put into remastering this film should be a standard by which all other DVDs are made.I won't bore you with a review of the movie.. plenty of others have. I'll just say that every film buff should own this dvd. It's breathtaking. You won't be able to take your eyes off of it."
3,A realistic review from a semi-serious film viewer.,"I'm no movie buff but I think I take movie viewing more seriously than the typical person. Avoiding the argument of how historically significant it is (as nearly every review seems to do) I would just say that it is a pretty good film. That's it. It's not life changing, not one of my favorites just a pretty good film. It essentially works like an allegory film where at the end it got me to think a little bit. I said ""Hmm..."" and then I moved on. That's all there was to it for me. If you like old films with a moral to ponder then you'll probably find the film interesting. If you don't then watching this film is not going to make you ""enlightened"" or ""hip"" so just watch what you like."
5,GREAT SATISFACTION!,"I sent a review last week. What happened to it? I'll try again.I was very pleased to receive ""Citizen Kane"" BEFORE THE PREDICTED SHIPPING DATE. I ordered from Amazon because I didn't think it would be available here. But I saw it last week in a store for almost twice what I paid for it. Will certainly order from the seller next time. Shirley"
2,Not very impressed with it,After all the hype surrounding this film I decided that I had better watch what was supposed to be the best film of the century. Maybe I expected to much from it but I was not impressed at all. It wasn't at all engaging and wasn't a very interesting story. Pity! I expected more
5,This is film artistry at the top of the form,"Many call it the best film ever, and I disagree with that only because I don't think there is any one best film. But in the realm of perfectly executed movies, this baby is in the short list, for sure. The story is believable, the characters interesting and played with great energy by the actors, the plot is up there with the best GReek and Shakespearean tragedies, and the filming - Wow! - what can one say about the filming other than that it is pure artistry? Every camera angle, every actor positioning, every light, all thought out seriously by Welles for dramatic and symbolic pointing.This is one of my favorite movies because it does everything well - plot, acting, filming, and creative and symbolic use of placement of people and objects. This is one to own."
5,Deservedly atop most lists,"Citizen Kane has been called the greatest film of all time by numerous scholars, critics and filmmakers throughout the last 20 years. Though Orson Welles has little else to be remembered by, this film has solidified his place in American film history. In fact, I would go so far as to say this film has solidified Orson Welles's name throughout the entire world, putting his name up there with Fellini, Kurosawa, Bergman, Kubrick and Lang. The film basically was the beginning of the real art film, and nothing before or since has come close.Though dull on occasion, the cinematography keeps the viewer generally interested, and the plot keeps a steady pace. Welles puts in a good performance, and the entire story is capable of being read into on multiple levels. A must have for any general DVD collection.10/10."
5,Grow old and tell me this film isn't relevant,"I was shocked to read the negative reviews. Then again, I probably shouldn't be. Ask an old person what their life was all about, and they will likely share in some of Kane's heartache - the struggle to find intimacy and purpose and happiness. The negative reviews likely reflect either a dislike of the cinematic medium or the banal shallowness of popular culture, an intemperance for thought and sobriety. I suspect that those who don't like the movie have shut down the ability to reflect meaningfully on life or are too young to appreciate it... Older people generally know better - everyone has a Rosebud..."
1,Don't Buy this Version,"Don't buy this version of Citizen Kane. 1.) Two of the DVDs come stacked on top of each other, something Warner Brothers (the makers of the regular and collector's version) highly do not recommend. 2.) Hairline cracks: my first copy came with hairline cracks in the feature disc and with severe cracks in one of the supplemental discs; my second copy came with hairline cracks in one of the supplemental discs; again Warner Brothers themselves warned me not to play a disc with hairline cracks. 3.) Within 5 minutes of buying this version the glue on the box failed and it started to fall apart.I thought the problem was with Warner Brothers, but they disowned any connection to the gold version. Save yourself the headache and just get the special edition version and not the Gold."
2,why is this movie praised?,"That is a good question for a psychologist to study. Also, why those modern paintings that are just some smears are praised. All the people I know (including me) who said they tried to watch this movie didn't watch much of it because it's so boring. I don't like Wells's acting either, not in this movie or in any other movie. He's pretentious and bombastic, and when he tries to convey tender emotion he's completely fake."
3,"It's okay, but I just don't love it","This movie was okay, and I think I understand why it was such a big deal. I just didn't fall in love with it. At least now I understand references to the movie."
2,"Worn out filmprint, no extras, no thanks","Recently bought Citizen Kane on DVD (see Amazon UK, it's the yellow sleeve with Kane looking up) but what a disappointment! Except for one theatrical trailer and a booklet, there are no extras on this disc, yet many a good documentary about this film has been made. To add injury to insult a worn out filmprint has been used: cables, dots, et cetera. Shame on the schmuck that made the decision to release what many people call the best film ever made this way!! Do not waste your money on this one."
2,Overrated,"Citizen Kane is most likely the most overrated movie in history. Now the directing and acting are great, but it takes a whole crew to make a good movie, and Citizen Kane suffered from one thing screenplay. The bad scripts and editing make this one of the most surprising movies to me."
1,This Movie is Dead!!!,I don't even know where to begin here. I just wonder if I watched the same movie as did the rest of those people that gave all these brilliant five star reviews. This film is one of the dreariest pieces of celluloid that Hollywood ever put on. It should be enbalmed because it never comes to life! Its dead! I will never understand how this came to be voted as the number one film of all time.
1,The Best? It's not even a good movie!,"Every time I see this boring film, I feel I really wanna get out of it. It's dark, long, and tedious. I think they try hard to make people think it's a masterpiece but it is not actually! If you wanna see this film because you are convinced by those critics voting it for the best film ever, you will find yourself deceived later I warn you."
2,Disappointing,"For all the talk about how painstakingly this was reproduced, I can't for the life of me understand why it isn't available in the original widescreen format. This is visually a very nice reproduction of the film in TV format, but we will not see Welles' vision until it is produced for DVD in its original format.The soundtrack on this is horrible. The sound is reproduced at a very low volume, forcing you to turn your TV volume way up. Then the few musical moments come blaring out at top volume. A little bit of compression and attention to detail would have taken care of this."
1,What a blunder!!,"It sounds so great. Just what I've been waiting for, Citizen Kane on DVD with lots of stuff as a bonus. THEN YOU READ ""Aspect ratio, full screen standard"". This is not the original theatrical frame, you know, with the black bands above and below. The left and right sides have been cut off so the TV screen is filled. What a stupid decision to present what is still considered the greatest american film ever made in this way. I'll wait till the real thing comes out on DVD to buy. RG"
1,"Sorry, couldnt feel or care for C.F. Kane at all.","If this movies underlying theme was Kanes loss of his youth and innocence symbolized by his sled, and that it affected his later behavior, then they did a terrible job conveying that on screen.Kane didnt seem all that distraught by having his wealth and power. He didnt seem regretfull that he had allowed his life to lean this way. The people he interated with gave more clues to the man then Orson Welles wooden performance. All I saw was a man who wanted to do good and burned out early and yet I didnt feel none of the passion of someone of his position and abilities should have radiated on the screen."
1,I expected a lot more than this from the greatest film ever.,"This film is nothing but pure hype. If the film is not good enough to claim the title of the greatest film ever made, it should not be claimed that title. It's ridiculous to choose this film over many other great films to hold the title of the best American film. Citizen Kane is not for those who truly love great movies. It's very disappointing."
1,Disappointed!,I was extremely disappointed. Amazon sent me a DVD that is supposed to be used in another country. It would not even work in my DVD player so I don't know if the movie was any good or not. They made a big mistake at my expense.
2,"Boring, Overrated","Criticically acclaimed it might be, but to me this film was boring, too long, and not very redeeming. Not something I'd watch more than once."
2,"Important For Its Time, But A Bore","OK, this was an important film for its time -- noone can dispute that. It revloutionised the use of the camera amd the use of space in the mise-en-scene. But the thing is that the story is just unbearably dull! The characters are too hammy and look like they are acting and fail to get the sympathy of the audience at any time. Kane is a jerk who has about as much self-understanding as a two year old kid. How can most people relate to him? if you are really into the history of film or cinematography, this movie is of immeasurable importance and it should be studied. But if you just want to see a good movie with characters that you can relate to and a plot that is interesting, go elsehwere . . . this fiulm is all art and no soul."
3,IT DIDN'T SURVIVE THE TEST OF TIME..,"Although good, this picture didn't survive the test of time. Most of Chaplin's movies, for example, are much, much better, with direct and relevant points of view being clearly exposed."
1,Pure Hype!,"I couldn't wait to get this movie, really thought I'd been missing something for years. Then I saw it, didn't get it, didn't like it, but forced my way through the entire movie. Maybe you intellectual, artsy types go for this, but give me Star Wars any day!"
1,Defective,After two returns I give up. Defective discs. Quick replacement to but none of them work. Check yours out right away and save your packaging you may need it
3,Just okay,I hardly think this is the best film ever made. It's too gimmicky by half. The script isn't all that wonderful and I feel the Rosebud thing was a disappointment. It looks and feels like a magician show. Money can't buy you love-but if it can get you 9 out of 10 things in life-that ain't bad. Buy a dog. They love unconditionally. If you curious to see what all the hype is about or if you're studying film-then it's worth seeing.
3,"Artistic masterpiece, but lacking in interest","As many reviewers have noted, this movie was ranked #1 in AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time; however, one should take into consideration that AFI's ranking of films was almost entirely based on the aesthetics of film making. Any film maker/director/producer will tell you that Citizen Kane is an artistic masterpiece, but Welles does this using many (at the time) new filming techniques such as camera angles, character placement/proxemics, form, framing, et cetera.The movie's plot is a different story. Charles Foster Kane is based on the real life man William Randolph Hearst, who was a newspaper tycoon during the late 19th century to the mid 20th century. The storyline will be boring to most casual movieviewers, so take discretion. I personally found the story a little interesting (due to my interest in history), but those looking for high suspense and action should go see another movie."
2,The best American Movie...Why?,"I would like to be brief in saying that I have a hard time seeing this movie as the ""Best American Movie."" Persoanlly, I did not find this movie very interesting at all."
2,It was a bad movie that had me confused!!,What does rosebud mean? Citizen Kane is a very confusing movie that starts with Charles Foster Kanes death. Then starts with newsreels that does not make any since.Mr. Kane is married twice and does not know how to love at all!!! Mr. Kane dies a lonly and unmissed man!!
3,Citizen Kane,I had to watch this movie for a film class. It is ranked #1 on the Top 100 Movies List of greatest movies ever made. This ranking is partly due to the innovative skill the director used in producing this movie.
4,Same documentary,This Doc is included in the enhanced DVD of the film. I bought both thinking that it wasn't.
5,It still belongs among the best films of all time,"Many alive today are too young to remember what Hollywood and the film industry were like immediately after the advent of sound films. This film wasn't a big-budget one, but it helped launch the careers of many find actors and actresses like Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, etc. This film caused quite a stir in Hollywood at the time of its theatrical release. However, its appeal probably won't withstand the passage of time with each generation; the mixed reviews presented here attest to that."
5,"A masterwork, perhaps the best film ever made.","Citizen Kane is a masterwork of movie craftsmanship and storytelling. Arguably, it is the best film ever made."
5,"Hail for ""CITIZEN CANE""!!!",IT IS A SUPERB FILM; IT IS A MAGICAL FILM; IT IS AN EXCELLENT FILM. THE GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN. IT DESERVES 10 STARS!!! MY BIGGEST THUMBS UP!
5,Masterpiece,"Citizen Kane... It's simple It's what movies can rarely acheive, (perfection}. There just is nothing like it. watching it is like seeing a work of art unfold before your eyes. Brillant on all levels.Orson welles set a new standard in film that wouldn't be realized for years to come.For all you young film lovers who watch film today and are so easily impressed sit in a dark room and watch this film, you will understand!!!!!!"
4,Great Movie in 1941 and Today.,Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)A Professor and movie buff at my place of work and I got into a conversation about Orson Welles. Asking me if I ever seen the movie Citizen Kane I replied although I knew of the movie I did'nt recall ever seeing it. So I purchased it. Considered by many as the greatest movie ever made it did not disappoint. The acting was terrific. The camera angles and shots were for the time in a league of their own. Making a movie based on the lastword of a dying man (rosebud) and keeping you the movie goer watching until the end just to find out what he meant was also amazing.To bad we do not see Hollywood put more of these types of movies out.To find the best that Hollywood has to offer I believe you must look to it's past.This movie is an shining example of that.Well worth the purchase price and a fine addition to any movie collection.
5,what can you say?,"It's one of the great films of all-time. Cinematagraphy, screenplay, acting, music--stunning in every respect. Orson was a genius, and despite problems with studios and funding he made many other brilliant films, most notably The Magnificent Ambersons and Chimes at Midnight."
5,"Best print, best film","This region-free blu-ray is easily the best print of this wonderful film I've ever seen. Of the two DVDs packaged with the Blu-ray, only one is region free (a lengthy doc about Welles vs Hearst) but it's a great, thorough, revealing look at the film's turbulent history. Hugely recommended."
1,A perfect candidate for MST3K??,"whew what a stinker. I don't really care if Welles was the first to use a certain camera angle, that doesn't create excellence in my book. Somebody should re-release this with some sort of on-screen drinking game, it might make it a little more tolerable - of course it may just depress you into a suicidal alcoholic stupor and you'll end up bitterly bemoaning the loss of your childhood crap you gave up for wealth and power. It isn't even that I dislike Welles, I enjoyed him in the Third Man and The Muppet Movie (<---joke). Good movies tell stories capable of engaging the audience, this didn't it presented an obituary with a lot of bitching. Look up something by Lang, Jodorowsky, anyone."
1,not as good as welcome to spring break,"this film is of decent quality, but falls far short of such classics as welcome to spring break. welcome to spring break has a fat man who screams ""gators"" for no apparent reason. citizen kane does not. also, it fails to feature wwf wrestler kane, an inexplicable omission given the title."
2,Grossly overrated,"In its day ( Note: IN ITS DAY ), this was ground breakingstuff. A young punk lashing into the newspaper industrywith such gusto and giving people a glipse of somethingthey may only have suspected. But that does not make it aclassic and I don't think it stands the test of time at allwell. Welles should be more correctly remembered for theimpact of ""The War Of The Worlds"" broadcasts - that trulyshowing his impact within the wider reference of the cultureof his day.Citizen Kane is at best a chapter in a life - and probably justa footnote if the truth be told.Could such a movie be made now with Mr Murdoch owning Fox?Of course not."
1,I'M NOT PRETENDING TO BE SMART!!,I love what one of the reviews below said about people not having to pretend to be smart to like Citizen Kane. I'm not pretending to be smart. I may be dumb but I know a good movie when I see one. This is not one of those.
1,It was a confusing movie that had me bored!!!!!!,"What does rosebaud mean? Citizen Kane starts out with Charles Foster Kanb dieing at the bigining. Then is goes on with newsreels all about his life, like what he did. This movie is very confusing and hard to follow and understand.Charles Foster Kane does not know how to love, infact he gets married twice and does not love his wife he just wants somebody to love him. All he cares about is his newspaper buisness and nothing else. Kane dies a lonly and unmissed man. If i were to rate this movie it would be a 2! It is a very weird and confusing film!!!"
1,AS A CLASSIC MOVIE LOVER....,"I just want to say that NOTHING, absolutely nothing in the world could make me sit through this travesty ever, ever again. It is mystifying to me, with all the great films out there that this piece of ponderous intellectualism would be voted as the number one film of all time. Obviously, there are many who agree with me. This is one of the worst films I have ever sat through and believe me ...it took a lot. I dozed several times during the viewing and when I woke up had to back up to the places where I dozed off just to see if I had missed anything.....(I hadn't). This is the most overrated picture I have ever seen and certainly not worthy to hold the title of ""Best film ever made"". That is a laugh!! Needless to say, I sold mine for 12 bucks at used CD store."
1,It's getting worse everytime you see.,It would be difficult to find a movie more boring than this. THIS MOVIE IS MADE TO BORE YOU. I really don't know anything good to say about Citizen Kane except the fact that it is so bad that all the commentaries in the dvd and good reviews from famous critics can't even save this terrible film.
1,Yuck!,"I saw this movie and just about puked in my lap because it was so terrible! Go see the Da Vinci Code instead. Tom Hanks is ten times the actor Orson ""Fatty McFat"" Welles ever was!Cheers."
1,it stunk,"I have had the displeasure of seeing this movie twice. It had no story, the acting was bad and it did not hold the viewer's attention in any way. The only people i recommend it to are insomniacs becuase this one's gonna put you to sleep quick. the ending is downright stupid, rosebud ooh a sled..oh no i ruined the ending..well i dont care, i did you all a favor by sparing you the agony of having to watch this piece of cinema filth."
1,a success,"Orson Welles wanted to make himself obnoxious and he succeeded. Very pretentious movie, not very intelligent, even more annoying than Last Year in Marienbad or the English Patient. The Emperor's New Clothes. For the undiscriminating viewer who badly wants to be high class."
2,Most Overrated,"I've heard all the explanations as to why this is supposed to be the greatest film of all-time, but the bottom line is: it was boring. Why should the audience care about a guy who has everything and insists on being miserable? The only thing Kane seemed to enjoy was his ""tortured loneliness"" shtick, and so he died alone. Oh flipping well.The most important element in any film is STORY - and this story was BORING."
1,Citizen Kane,"I see the 70th edition in Blue Ray has been issued. If this movies was in ""Gold Ray"" and ""3 D""it still stinks...how in the world this movie. has received all the critical acclaim that it has gotten over the years is a farce. It was given to me as a Xmas Present, I sold it back to the Trade In Stores for about 2.50... Save your money . This movie based loosely on Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies Love Affair is so outdated and boxed in by the Hayes Office which was in the by gone era the keeper of morality and Hearst power to control the government is laughable"
1,Citizen Kane,"I watched this film with someone who had to do this for a film class and it is a acquired taste like licorice,It is boring,Predictable and worst of all made by A Has been and Sympathizer at best and at worst an Actual ""Red"".The fact euroPeons would tell you it was the best of all the time should make anybody run and laugh at such an elitist smug assertion.All it is a hit piece on Hearst of course it was going to be controversial and in the end cater only to bleeding heart Fascistliberals,Like The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind it has been labeled a Masterpiece when in fact it is nothing but Long, Boring and Anemic."
2,Arguable,This movie is arguably the best American movie ever made but not self-evidently. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument.
1,Don't waste your time with this trash!,"I was browsing movies on the Internet for something best to watch, using reviews to decide if it might be worth my time or not. When the movie started, I already knew this one was a mistake. I sat through the whole thing patiently and in the end I felt very cheated out of a buck and a couple hours of my life I could of spent doing something else. The acting, characters, script, and plot were pathetic. The ending that people keep mentioning wasn't a big deal at all. This movie was not artistic as some claim. It wasn't entertaining. It was just a bad attempt at a boring story about newspaper tycoon. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,"If Citizen Kane is a great film, what would a bad film be like?","To enjoy Citizen Kane, you have to be able to answer the question above. I just hate almost everything about this film. I think it's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep. Many people will fall for it. But it's very hard to make a truly GREAT FILM!"
1,This movie reminds me of the Blair Witch Project.,"It's just like ""the Blair Witch Project."" A lot of people will watch Citizen Kane because of the hype and find themselves disappointed. It's sad but true."
2,Unique,"Ah, the sled. Not really sure why this movie is rated so high among the historical films, but what do i know? I just watch what the AFI tells me to."
2,Is this really the best? They must be kidding!,"It is so funny to think that this film is the greatest. What a joke! When movielovers can speak out their minds, the result is ""the truth about it."" I'm not surprised why this film got so many negative comments. I hate this film since the first time I saw it on Video tape 10 years ago. It is so pointless and boring. The character is not what we care for. You can't make a good film with a poor script. Citizen Kane is a good example of how a film fails to entertain people by its storytelling. No doubt it's not the best. It is not even a good film. I give 2 stars due to the effort that they tried hard to make it good. Sorry, ""it doesn't work."""
2,Not very good...,"It starts like a horror movie, exemplified by dying Kane's melodramatic uttering of ""Rosebud"". It tells the story of Hearst-like character in flashbacks. His early successes ( the fact is that he was already rich to start with), marriage to a boring woman, his failure to win an election because of his devotion to his mistress and then I stopped watching, reminded me of those boring Lenin documentaries' that I watched as a kid in Soviet Russia - given that I had no choice and one Channel to reckon on with. Again you are fooled by stupid people who for reasons best known to them call a tabby cat ( Citizen Kane) a Lion ( any Satyajit Ray movie). Hearst was right to oppose this garbage, I would too, since it is so boring. It aint worth my two stars, but today I feel kind!!!"
2,"Wow, I just don't get it...","I have heard for years how innovative, groung breaking, if you only see one movie in your life...Wow! Does anyone in reality care or sympathize at all with any of these characters? ""Rosebud"" please - get a life, I could not wait for this clown to buy it. This is the kind of dribble that anyone would write for a college class titled Pretense 101. Give me Captain Ron any day."
3,You can take it or leave it...,"It's 2006. 1941's Citizen Kane does not meet modern audience expectations. It shouldn't; it is a product of its time, and if you can meet it on that level you might stay awake. The superb documentary elevates the curiosity, and the movie itself is unfortunately less interesting than the story of making it.The film is definitely ahead of its time in terms of mood and camera work but if you are honest with yourself you will find your patience tested by the film. I hate to give a vaunted classic such an ambivalent review but caveat emptor, this is a difficult experience."
5,The Greatest Movie Ever,"Citizen Kane is a classic - a grand story line, fully realized characters, and masterful direction - combine to produce the greatest masterpiece in the history of American cinema. Every film buff should have a copy of this DVD, it truly is a wonderful package combining the movie with details of the intrigue that surrounded it's creation. The film itself is pure genius - a magical tale of the creation of a media empire and how the empire came crumbling down, evenly sprinkled with comedic wit and cinematic innovation. The additional documentary, The Battle over Citizen Kane, delves into the fight between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for Kane), and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1995. This film has always been at the top of my list of all-time great movies, and the DVD became a treasured addition to my collection on the first day it was released. A truly exceptional film !"
5,The Saddest Movie That I Have Ever Seen!,"I watched this movie with my mother to really find out where Charles Kane went wrong. We both had seen the movie many times. We would stop our VCR and discuss when and how Kane went wrong. And we both agreed. Kane was yanked away from his mother before he could be really loved. He then sought love from people through money. Not having really been loved, he could not give it. ""Rosebud"" represented the last thing that he held onto from his childhood. Both my mother and I were astonished to see how this pattern was repeated over and over again. Especially from Jed Leland and Susan Alexander's accounts. This is a ""must see"" film. But I believe that one must watch it attentively in order to understand the real meaning behind the film. One of the newspaper men at the end is Alan Ladd, star of the movie ""Shane"". He has a very short part and is hardly visible. Good luck and good watching."
5,Exploring Time in Citizen Kane,"For those fans or scholars of this classic, MIT has an article essay on their OpenCourseWare site 'Exploring Time in Citizen Kane':[The allure of Citizen Kane has persisted through the changing of cinematic technique and style. Although full of technical innovation and revolutionary for its time, its unshakable position as the `greatest movie of all time' cannot be attributed solely to the technical genius of Orson Welles. His use of special effects was inventive, and showed clear influence from Welles' experience as a magician. In addition to its use of special effects, Citizen Kane was also groundbreaking for its addition of meaning to existing cinematic and editing techniques.] author Alvin Lin[...]"
5,Unsinkable.,"In spite of the hoopla, lavish praise, superlatives designating this as the most critically acclaimed film of all time, ""Citizen Kane"" simply can't be dislodged from its preeminent place in the history of cinema. But don't let all that's been written about the film scare you. It's a compact, fast-paced mystery story (What's ""Rosebud"") at it's most accessible level. But it's also a microcosm of the American dream, suggesting the direful consequences of its realization. Why is it a great film? Because it works on every level--scripting, casting, acting, editing, photography, mis en scene, sound. Take any frame of the film and it's possible not only to reconstruct the rest of the film (it's that organically whole) but to compose a dissertation on the meanings suggested by that frame alone. In the end what we're left with is not only a great movie but the image of a young boy whose loss of innocense is ours to share."
1,Watch City Lights instead,"Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time. How it garnered that reputation is far beyond me. This film is often prided on its technical innovations. The lighting, the cinematography, the editing is all done exeptionally. Lovers of the film resort to saying things like that, because the actual content of the film is banal and uninspired. Charles Foster Kane is not an interesting character. Through Well's film we learn nothing of Kane, he is one dimensional. This film is completely shallow, as if no emotion went into making it. It is mechanical, fails to make me think or question what I thought to be true. It fails as a character study and as an examination of human behavior. For a true work of art, by a true artist (as opposed to merely a Hollywood personality like Wells), watch City Lights instead. Citizen Kane is just empty."
1,Pure Overrated Garbage,"What they forgot to put in the DVD set is the documentary ""The Hype Behind Citizen Kane"", which tells a story how this film unrighteously claims the title of the best American film. This movie is so boring and put audience throught a story of a man's empty life that would only interest few people."
1,This film doesn't deserve the best American film!,"The Godfather should be the one, not this one. I don't appreciate anything much in this film. I agree with many people here who say it's overrated. It is overrated indeed!!!!!"
1,why do people like this movie?,"I have never understood why this movie is consistently rated as the best American film ever made. The cinematography is too dark almost the whole time, making the viewer strain to see faces clearly enough to tell the characters apart. The plot is too psychological to follow without effort, and Kane himself is not a good enough character to justify such effort. I never felt strongly enough about him (either way) to care about anything he does or experiences. Basically I would rate this movie as a pretentious waste of two perfectly good hours."
1,"Citizen Kane is a very poor movie, but it's not definitely the worst film ever!","The worst film of all time would be Plan 9 from Outer Space. Even Citizen Kane is more boring than Plan 9, tt doesn't mean that it's worse. It's just one of those films people feel that they waste their time watching it."
2,"Citizen Kane: Spoon Feeding ""Brilliance"" to Americans.","Yes, how bourgeiosie to love this film! ""BAAAH,"" says a gullible American public. It is probably otiose to recommend, in reviews or in conversation, a film that is a classic, especially one so waywardly eccentric as this one. It is true that a taste for Citizen Kane must be acquired and that a comparative few will find it worth acquiring.The American Film Institute made this film the #1 film of all time. Why? An incestuous and sychophantic group of directors, screenwriters, actors, actresses, and producers, a largely insulated and undereducated lot, have perpetuated a myth of ""brilliance"" around this film. Given the high expectations around the film, it necessarily must attain a higher status than would otherwise be expected."
1,Not worth my time..........,"I recently had a review for this film deleted. So what, if I don't care for it, freedom of speech Amazon. Personally I think, Jaws, The Godfather, Amedeus, and Rocky are much better films. I just was bored by this. That is why there is a no button to click on, people don't like my review, I won't be hurt. And reviewer F.R., my ""thoughts"", Dumb and Dumber is better. I love America."
1,The best film ever????,Are you kidding me? I cannot believe that so many people are giving this more than 1 star.Why are there so many people that support such a lousy and boring film? Is it because they like to look deep and smart? It is truly sad that anyone would feel this way.
1,Szzzzzzzzzzz!!!!,Who needs Sominex?? Just pop this movie into your DVD or VCR player and you'll be asleep in five minutes!! Trust me!!
1,BORING!!!!,"This movie has the pacing of an elephant walking through quicksand. Orsen Welles is an okay actor, but he's no Frank Stallone."
1,Over-hyped film,"I completely agree with the comments about what is all the hype about? with the film ""Citizen Kane"". It is not even a good film much less the greatest film ever made. There seems to be a cult following for this film or around Orson Welles. It never ceases to amaze me when some film ""critic"" raves about Citizen Kane."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"Citizen Kane was a real disappointment. Totally unoriginal plot, bad lighting, cheesy sets. Boring too. And gosh, what is with that Rose Bud thing? That was freaky!!! Woah dude!!! Anyway this movie was whack & mad boring cause you don't even see the dude porkin' the girl, and she isn't even really hot anyway. It was a bummer too that it was in black and white and all the guys looked the same cause they all wore suits. The music was all weird and whack, yo. I didn't like it. It didn't have a good beat or dance rhythm section. But it was mad sweet, the dude's crib, but he just be pacing around like, whassup? He should have had a mad party and had mad homies and sum real ladies up in that piece. I thought to my self how could u be so rich & be so messed up, yo?"
1,"IF YOU LOVE FILM (and ""Citizen Kane""), DON’T BUY THIS DVD!","(...) With films of the caliber of Citizen Kane this is all the more important...and I can't believe that they would go to so much trouble to release this fine film, with all these ""bonus materials"" AND NOT PRESENT IT IN WIDESCREEN! It's not even an option! (And for a nice dash of salt in the wound, they use a widescreen still of one of the first scenes in the movie as a background for the menu…hit “Play,” and then watch that same scene in all 2/3rds of it’s glory!) (...)"
1,Save your money!,"It's beyond any word to describe how bad Citizen Kane is. Having been heard the hype ""the greatest film ever"", I decide to see and keep waiting for the good stuffs to come up but it never does. Don't be a victim of this fraud!"
2,An overrated and boring film.,"In spite of all the hype that has been generated for this movie, I frankly find it boring and extremely slow moving. Orson Welles is ponderous, and his character is almost cartoonish. He is so domineering that the other characters almost seem like an afterthought. While I like fine film making, I found the use of dubious camera angles distracting. The plot is so stiff that it is borish beyonf belief. I own the VHS version but will not buy it for my DVD collection, which is replacing my VHS collection."
2,Lots of good ideas that never all quite come together...,"I finally watched this movie the other night and I didn't understand the hype. Some of the sequences were impressive and certainly the age of welles is quite amazing... All in all, I found it kind of hard to follow. The plot jumped around too much and delved too deeply into a character you felt that you should know but you really didn't.I guess my main problem is the fact that this is supposed to be one of the greatest films ever made so when I watched I was expecting to be blown away and I didn't even catch a breeze. Watch it and appreciate the techniques but don't expect it to change you life."
2,The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time,"In college, my best friend talked me into watching the movie and doing a report on it for him. I could barely stand to watch it all. And several months ago when I saw that the AFI had selected it the number 1 American film of all time, I was stunned. Who are these people? I know Citizen Kane is partly based on a real person's life, but the plot totally sucked. The acting wasn't great either. Everyone talks about the cinematography, well I wasn't even impressed with that, though I suppose back when it was release it was something."
4,"Good movie, but why all the fuss?","Citizen Cane is a good movie, and I reccomend it to everone, but I don't see why there's so much fuss over it. It's called the best movie ever made. There are much better movies out there then Citizen Cane. There's nothing that it has that other movies don't have, except for the advanced (for it's time) cinematography. Anyway, it's a good movie to get into."
3,America's Kublai Khan,"The story of Charles Foster Kane.I liked the story, but I didn't buy into the hype!A nice story, but that's it.I mean, this movie might have been important fifty years ago, but times have changed!Everybody who had anything to do with this movie, the writer\director, the inspiration, dead.One of the AFI's most important movies of th 20th century, 20th century!We're diving headfirst into century number 21.Time to put away the toys of yesteryear!"
1,Not a movie,"I bought this expecting to see the movie ""Citizen Kane"" however, when it arrived in the mail it was not a movie. It came in a weird box that was not like a movie and when I opened it there were two CDs inside. Normally when you buy movies they have a large tape inside that you put into a VCR. I put the CDs into my VCR but they didn't do anything, the machine just made a weird sound. So then I tried putting them into it one at a time but the same thing happened. I even tried rewinding it but nothing happened. I thought maybe it was just the music from the movie, but I don't have a CD player so I can't find out. The box says that it is a movie but it does not include instructions for using the movie or how to make it work. I just wanted to see a movie, I didn't ask for all of this!"
2,"""I don't care about his stupid @55 sled""","I think I found the comment by one reviewer, ""I don't care about his stupid @55 sled"", more entertaining than the actual movie. But then again,. someone has said it gets better the more you watch it.meh,. yay for the stupid @55 sled."
1,Citizen Kane speaks for itself!,"This movie doesn't deserve any praises. Honestly, the people who saw this movie should sue AFI for the hype they made. Citizen Kane was ultimate garbage in terms of entertainment. You will find that it hard to stay awake."
2,overrated,"american schlock...i can think of at least 100 better foreign movies. As for the cinematography, John ford created it in the 30's in the movie, The Informer."""
2,A Major Let Down,"I have heard that this movie was THE best American made film ever, but when I watched it I had a very different impression. I love watching old black and white movies, but I found this one too long, boring, and pointless. It got a little better near the end, but it got off to a REALLY slow start. I certainly don't think this is the #1 film, but that's only my opinion...."
3,Movie Citizen Kane,Good movie of its time. It is somewhat dated now. Connction to the famed publisher has receded into 'ancient' history.
2,Overrated!,Some critics said it's the best film ever made. To me it's absolutely boring and doesn't deserve that much compliment. No offense! I can't pretend to rate it too highly than the level it should be.
3,z z z z z z....,"overrated. bigtime. go buy RAN if you want to see a movie that outdoes this one by a loooooooongshot. and for you lug nuts,RAN in not a cheesy action movie, its a very very mature japanese honor flick that people who thought the matrix was a masterpiece would never in their entire lives understand. ok, this movie is pretty boring. its really, well, boring. but that doesent mean its not good. but, you must have this movie in your movie collection, or you will die."
2,Remaster is NOT good,"I bought this DVD thinking the Re-master would be good.Unfortunately it's NOT.There are scenes where debris (string, hair, something?) shows up at the bottom of the picture (usually lower left).I bought this from Borders so I'm pretty sure it's legit. You would think that people in charge of re-mastering Citizen Kane would take better care in the transfer. If I could notice it, well anybody could.On top of that it seems cloudy throughout the picture.As I understand it Lowry (Now owned by Dolby Digital) did the transfer.For what many belive the greatest picture of the 20th century I'm greatly dissapointed.Citizen Kane is a GREAT film. Too bad they did'nt take the time to actually WATCH what they produced and make sure crap did'nt show up in the film"
3,The most over-praised movie ever!,Whether the AFI list or the Sight&Sound poll this is the film considered the finest by the so called experts.Have any of them really watched The Godfather?
3,Why is this one of the great films? Spoiler Alert!,"I watched Citizen Kane again last night after several years. It struck me as not being as great as the hype. If you pay attention at the beginning of the film, when Kane is a boy, it is obvious what is going to happen and what Rosebud means. Other than that, it is not a great film. If you are a man who identifies with the psychological aspects of the film, and this is your first time watching it, then ok, it is shocking in it's great insights. But once you have seen it, then, what is the appeal?"
5,Brilliant Portrayal of Humanity,"Citizen Kane will continue to reap praise for it's well-planned use of cinematography, lighting, and music. But even beyond the superb filmmaking lies the story of a boy growing into a man, and the personal challenges he faces.Charles Foster Kane rises from a meager childhood to become one of the most successful men in America. Yet, even with all of his fabulous wealth and success, he faces the harsh lesson that money cannot buy love, happiness, or health. He goes to extremes in wielding his power and influence in vain attempts to once again feel the happiness he knew as a child.Many people love this movie for the great filmmaking techniques alone, but the sad story laid out before you reminds you of the importance of focusing on what are truly the priorities in your life."
2,Review of Blu Ray version,"Citizen Kane is quite rightly praised as one of the best American movies of all time. That's not the problem; the problem is this Blu Ray print which I find to be overly contrast-y. So much so that there is little detail in the blacks. This is not the way I remember seeing it previously, and I don't believe that the brilliant cinematographer Gregg Toland would approve of this transfer. I also A-B compared it to a previous DVD special edition, and I don't find the resolution of the film much improved in the Blu Ray version. Indeed, I think I prefer the contrast ratio of the DVD version, which in itself I find also is problematic as far as contrast ratio and overall view-ability. Very disappointed."
2,"Not a bad movie, just not a lot of thought put into it","Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) comes to visit his sister and finds that the town is being overrun with members of the Arian brotherhood. These Arian brothers certainly weren't expecting a Taekwondo expert to show up. Tommy and his sister's husband played by Christopher Mcdonald team up to stop the racism.The action is decent and the story isn't too bad. I haven't seen part 2 yet, but this is not even close to being as good as part 1. The directing job is not bad and the cheesiness is at a bare minumum, but the movie just isn't that interesting. There is 1 very funny clown fight scene, but the rest of the fights are just average. The finale is pretty intense with some good vehicle stunts and a bunch of shootouts. The final fight is OK for an American movie, but you probably won't be blown away by it.2.5/5If you like this movie, then you might as well get the Dimension Video 2-pack that has Best of the Best part 4 on it."
3,It's okay,Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
5,Well written book,"I have already finished courses in strength of materials etc., and am using this book as a reference, instead of those voluminous handbooks. The book is very well written and William Nash has an excellent, straight forward way of putting forth the key points. The book has all the information you might need for a first course in strength of materials. I also use this book in conjunction with a finite element text to give me the theoretical values for comparison. In summary, if you need a solid backup for your textbook and a useful reference, you won't go wrong with this one."
4,An excellent book for first course.,"This book is very good. First year students will find it very user friendly. Even a graduate engineer may need it to brush up previouly learned skills. All topics - e.g. material properties, stress, beam deflection, bending moments, columns, etc. are covered in very lucid manner. A must book for EVERY engineer."
4,Schaum is Good as Always,I have always used Schaum's Outlines for classes and this one is working great. It is very helpful with useful examples and solved problems.
5,A very comprehensive Disco collection!!,"If you like Disco, but don't have a big collection, this is a great way to go! The groups included span the range of Disco (which is broader than I realized before I bought this for my Dad's birthday), and every major disco song is included. The packaging is detailed and gives good notes about the era and the music, and the transfer to the digital medium is fine; it sounds as good as one could ask for.There are no world-changing songs here, but there is plenty of ear candy and fluff, which is what Disco was about anyway, so you can't miss with this collection!"
3,A treat from the Estevez/Sheen family,"This is one of Charlie's best performances as an actor, and I've seen many. Charlie plays his role as Private Bean with such passion, especially in the beginning, that he seems to bring you into the scenes with him. Maybe the fact that he was doing his father's movie with 2 family members added a little spark to the fire. Martin Sheen is excellent, of course, in his role as the soon-to-be-crazy Commander. However, I think the last scene in which we see the Commander was a bit contrived. It probably would have read better in a book because books seem to give more poetic license. An added bonus to the fine acting of Charlie, Martin, and Laurence Fishburn, was another Estevez son, Ramon. This is the first time I've seen Ramon in a movie - I hope it's not the last."
1,Prices of DVD's,"I don't see how some of you distributors are making any money, there is no way in hell I'm paying $40. plus dollars for a movie that's 20-30years old. I guess I'll never own Cadence."
5,REDNECK MAN,"CADENCE IS A ELBOW FUNNY MOVIE,ACTION DRIVEN,MOTIVATED SOLDERIES THAT FIND A WAY TO OVER COME A DIFFERNECE OF OPINON!!A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!"
4,Cadence,"I didn't get the video for myself. It was a gift for a friend, But I can honestly tell you, that I have seen the movie and it is a very good movie! Sometimes I wish I would have kept the movie for myself, but I had promised a friend I would give them the video as a gift."
3,Bill finds a niche,"Bill's third solo effort sees another stylistic change - syth pop disco! Si Si Je Suis Un Rock Star is a fun song and was an huge hit in Europe, but went nowhere in the States. Bill's voice actually lends itself well to disco! If you are a fan of synth pop and disco, you might like this one."
2,Three track deal,"Probably the poorest of the Silent Stone's solo efforts, mostly due to his poor attempt at early eighties art rock. Wyman's strong suite has always been his lack of pretense, which here only surfaces on three classic tracks Rio, Suzanne, and the immortal Lolita anthem, Je Suis en Rock Star, which alone is worth the price ofthe album. The rest is disposable. Fans looking for quality music would be better directed to Bill's more recent Rhythm Kings collection."
4,Everything you need to know about homoeopathy in one book!,"If you want to know how to practice homoeopathy, this is all you should need to read from the Founder himself. Forget Kent, Sankaran, Scholten, Sherr, Murphy, Herscu - this is the guy to read and learn from, Christian Samuel Hahnemann.Every answer to every question you may have will be found in this book and if you intend to study homoeopathy, this should be the very first thing you read.Not many people like the Boericke translation. I find it easier to read every year - yes, you should read it once a year (from cover to cover). Most prefer Kunzli or O'Reilly's editions, but I like Boericke.This little edition published in India is great for keeping in your handbag and carrying with you to read and re-read at your leisure. If you want a reference edition, without so many editorial glitches, get an edition published in America or the UK."
1,Terrible Editing makes this unreadable,"One is so completely distracted, confused, and frustrated by the poor editing of this B Jain Pub Pvt Ltd (April 19, 2002) edition of Hahnemann's Organon that it renders the text unreadable. I am going to re-order the book from another publisher."
5,A welcome change,"This book brought me the warmth and kindred connection that I was looking for in these harsh times. It is fun, touching, and original. I love the characters, and am looking forward to more work from Timothy James Beck."
4,I Couldn't put it Down!,"This book is funny, with engaging characters and a hilarious story line, I highly recommend it!"
3,Former UK Member makes good,"The Zinc album is a concept album, and is typical of the genre of solo efforts from alternative rock group artists. All of the zinc songs blend together, with an overall theme in mind. The vocals are the only weak spot to an otherwise powerful effort from Jobson. It is unfortunate that he hasn't continued with similar solo efforts. His mastery of the instruments is impressive, and the sound is worthy of a good CD and sound system. Those of you that enjoy the group UK, Asia, Yes, Steve Howe's solo albums and Emerson, Lake and Palmer will enjoy this innovative album from Jobson."
3,Misleading Title,"I actually liked this book, for the most part, but I was led to believe that this would be a book about a female abortionist; what I read was a book mostly devoted to the *era* in which she practiced. I really wanted to get to know Ruth as a person, not just Ruth as abortionist. This book doesn't give you too many glimpses of her life - the majority of this ""biography"" is about abortion syndicates and trials. I would be tempted to read her daughter's memoir (autobiography?) but if it's written the way she's quoted in the book, I doubt I'd read the whole thing."
4,Easy to assemble and they look great.,"I recently picked up the Easy Track system at Fred Meyer's on clearance. Don't know how great the value is a full price, but for 70% off of retail this system was a still. The drawers were really easy to put together and they slide really well. I have put together desk drawers, etc before and these were by far the easiest to put together and install. I purchased the 8"" drawers and while they aren't huge, the work fine."
5,Great watch...,"TIMEX makes a Great watch, I've had 3 or 4 of these. Rugged and functional.The stock band after a few months will have to be replaced because the leather underside absorbs sweat and you know what happens. So I buy a simple nylon band that can be washed."
3,Great! But loud!,"This is a very comfortable watch. Light weight. Plastic and looks like it should only cost $30, but great for everyday work. Only complaint is it ticks very loud. I can hear it when driving, and even from across the room when quiet. It's pretty annoying."
5,Timex Expedition,"My husband likes being outdoors. He has two other quality watches, but enjoys wearing the Timex Expedition more. He finds it to be durable, comfortable, and dependable. This is his second Timex Expedition and he wore the first one for several years before it finally gave out."
5,Fantastic little watch,"Just a great watch. Keeps perfect time, very rugged and masculine. Paid less than $30.00 and have worn it snorkeling in Cozumel and working around the house."
4,First impression,"I have only owned the watch for one-day, so I can only give my first impression: Is inexpensive but looks cheaper than I expected from the photo, Date window is quite small and difficult to read with over-40 eyesight. The watch started up fine, Indiglo works well. Lightweight watch is comfortable on the wrist. Best feature is that time is very easy to read."
3,"Durable, Long lasting watch. Accurate. Ticking is loud.","I've had this watch for a few years now, and it's been indestructable. It's traveled around the world with me. It's good for low key use when a flashier watch will get you robbed in unfriendly areas. My watch of choice for travel in North Africa or Southeast Asia.It keeps time perfectly, but in those quiet moments in life, you'll actually hear the tick of this watch! Louder than any watch I've had. It's rather noticeable in a quiet room. I think it's because of the stamped steel back, Resin case, and polymer bezel. They don't seem to stop the noise. It's annoying enough that I have to take it off an put it away somewhere so I can sleep.So I generally like it. Looks good, works good, but the noisy ticking is an irritation."
3,Great basic watch but noisy,"I've had mine for over a year now and it's been a great, reliable basic watch -- and you gotta love Indiglo. But it is noisy. The tick-tick of the sweep second hand is easily heard in a quiet room and I do find it annoying at times when I'm reading or working."
2,Poor quality,"Disappointed. After about a week I can’t set the date. Pretty cheap construction. I like the style and the green wrist band looks good with a matching green shirt, but clashes with most everything else."
4,timex,bought this for my Army Reaserve son. he thinks it;s great and wears it all the time. just the thing for the outdoor lover in general
1,New and Not working,"I bought it for a gift to a family for Christmas, I sent it to Costa Rica, and the surprise is not working or repairable. It makes no sense to return it to Amazon, is more expensive all the formalities of international shipping, as well as the time spent. Very badly damaged items sold."
1,"Cheap plastic, Not waterproof!","I bought this watch expecting it to be the kind of watch that I could wear everyday and not worry about it breaking. Timex's marketing certainly made it seem this way, going as far as calling it an 'expedition' watch. The build quality, though, turned out to be very cheap. The entire thing was made of plastic, which I would be fine with if it turned out to be durable plastic, but it wasn't. The face became very scratched within the first few weeks, and, within 6 months the waterproofing failed. At this point it was scratched, filled with water, and completely unusable. I never took it below 5ft, which is well within its water resistance rating.Timex offers a limited warranty, but you have to pay shipping, so it's completely useless on such a cheap watch.That said, it's comfortable and easy to read, but that doesn't matter if it's this fragile."
1,Not Durable,"The band doesn't last. The backlight remains on because the stem doesn't always spring back causing the battery to wear out. Timex, to their credit, replaced it once but sent another just as poor. Spend a little more for a much better watch."
5,timex expedition watch,FANTASTIC. Cost great. Back light great. Time keeping great. Eight year battery great.
1,"Poor quality, went through two in two weeks","The first one had a stuck date indicator, and the crown (adjustment knob) fell off of the second one when I wasn't even touching it. I'm pretty surprised to read the other reviewers saying theirs have lasted for years. Maybe the newer ones are built more cheaply?"
5,love it!,"Bought this watch for my husband. He has several very expensive watches that I noticed he seldom wears. So I asked him why. He said he wasn't comfortable traveling in expensive jewelry. So we got to talking about watches and our favorites ones from our ""early years""(we're both in our 50's). We were both surprised to find out both of our favorite watches were Timex's.He is very happy with his new Timex. He wear it everywhere! We both laugh about the old Timex slogan: ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" Or as children, ""What time is it when an elephant sits on your Timex? It's time to get a new watch!""If you have never owned a Timex watch, you should try one. They are a excellent example of good ole american ingenuity. They are very reasonably priced, great looking, and very high quality. This is from a couple who have ran theirs through the washing machine a few times and they came out ticking!Buy one and ENJOY!"
1,The Vesuvius Club,"I had pretty high hopes for this book because the synopsis makes it sound like everything you could ever ask for in a novel...espionage, intrigue, secret societies bent on world domination, a roguish anti-hero. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It just got too ridiculous, and the plot was so simplistic it was like watching a cartoon. Another peeve of mine is that it was written in the first person with the main character Lucifer narrating, and he got on my nerves SO MUCH. He's thoroughly obnoxious, and was constantly making these little asides to the reader about how naughty and/or fabulous he feels himself to be. Plus, you can tell the author is trying SO hard to be witty and funny and he goes so over-the-top that it's like nails on a chalkboard."
2,I'm sorry I bought it,"I haven't made it past the fifth chapter in the book and I honestly dread picking it up again. Reading the the reviews and description before buying, I did not realize this book is a pastiche, not a genre I typically choose. Maybe I just don't ""get"" it. I think Austin Powers is funny, but film makes it easier to pick up the tone. I feel like The Vesuvius Club misses, it just seems like bad writing, not deliberate humor."
5,Excellent Manual,"Even if you ignore the subject matter, this is an excellent how-to book on crafts and construction. Leather-working, carpentry, upholstery, and even rope tying are explained in loving detail that even the most technically inept could easily grasp.After mastering the basics, the book has a large selection of projects, big and small, that are sure to be the envy of all of your friends.The most important attribute of this book is its readability. The author's writing style is down to earth and often quite humourous. You'll want to read it cover to cover. Definitely recommended."
3,Over priced,This would be a good book except fot its price. Text book prices have been coming down in BDSM. This one seems overpriced for the content. If you are good enough to build these projects your probably good enough to design them.
3,Braided Bondage,"I was hoping for something more in this book. Nice pictures, clear and easy instructions, but very little in the way of building bondage equipment...mostly it described a variety of braiding techniques and how to make various whips and lashes.For $39.95, I thought it would have more construction techniques. For $2.95 I can get a copy of The Family Handyman and it has more construction instructions in a single issue than this book does in all the pages."
3,Cool looking but functionality isn't the greatest...,"I had been contemplating snagging one of these for my f350 for some time, and when I found this on amazon for this price I finally got it. The claims of being so many times brighter than the stock light are simply not true. The LED lighting is very directional, meaning it is only bright if you are directly behind the vehicle, from any type of angle you can hardly even see it. The white lights do not light up the bed nearly as well as the stock light either. I rated it a 3 out of 5 because it looks ten times cooler than the stock setup, but the brightness just isn't what is claimed."
2,Brightness,"It's not a bright as I thought it should be, it does work so that is not the issue. I have a light bar under the tailgate that i like a lot but the 3rd brakelight just isn't impressive.It was very easy to install."
2,Not completely satisfied,"This third brake light/cargo light looks great on the back of my 2005 F-250 cab. The brake light is bright enough, but the cargo light is very dim and directional; it only ""illuminates"" the aft 1/3 of the bed and it doesnt light that portion very well at all."
2,Cool looking but not bright enough.,"Love the look and will keep it on my F450, but if you load your cargo bed at night you might pass on this unit. Not much light when illuminated. Cool yes, functional, not really!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"This is the first time that I have ever ordered anything and felt the need to review it. Let me start by saying that I have only been using this coffee pot for about two months and today the poorly-attached handle came off in my hands. There are many other complaints. It is a lot smaller than they advertise. Unscrewing the bottom takes an unbelievable amount of effort. Be careful while cleaning the pot. It is possible to cut yourself on the poorly finished metal. I really thought I was purchasing one of the higher-end stainless steel products, foolish me."
2,Snapdragon: More Drag..on than Snap,"Not a good film. Classic 1980-1990's scriptwriting bogs this film down big-time. Hard to believe, especially the guys girlfriend who is alright with him sleeping with Pam. Trust me, NO woman would just let this go so easily. Let's face it, the film's a bore EXCEPT for the nudity of Ms. Pam Anderson. Yes, she IS able to save the day her less (clothes) is more act. A very rare feat indeed, but Ms. Pam is able to pull it off (and her clothes!). You'll never see this film on T.V. in it's full form, so if like Ms. Pam (o.k. I admit I do) then buy the DVD. The beauty from Vancouver Island will NOT disappoint you."
3,"good movie, Pam Anderson at her prime.","Great Pam Anderson softcore scenes when she was at her prime.Story is regular, but you definitely won't be buying this movie for other reason rather than watching P.A in softcore scenes."
1,Worst Movie Ever?,"Yes, yes it is. The plot was horrible Pamela Anderson is the best thing about the movie but she is only in it like half the time and the other actors are boring as hell. What stinks even worse is she only shows her breasts throughout the whole movie for like 2 or 3 minutes at best. This movie could have been pretty good but with horrible co stars a bad script and an extreme lack of nudity somebody really dropped the ball. Do not buy this movie if you want stuff with Pamela Anderson buy the sex tape she made with MOTLEY CRUE drummer Tommy Lee or get the Playboy DVD she has or the movies BARB WIRE & BLONDE AND BLONDER. All 4 of those DVD's are killer!"
2,The 2 stars are for Pam's body,"This movie is very bad. If not for a very young, often nude Pam Anderson, it would be a total waste of time."
4,BE CAREFUL!,"This is a fascinating book - but it IS NOT the book on which the movie 'The Exorcist' was based. That book - by William Peter Blatty - is currently out of print for unexplicable reasons, despite being one of the best-selling horror books of all time. I recommend this book to any fan of the movie, but I recommend the original book to anyone who can find it."
2,"Terrific, if you want Parisien-style Charleston","I purchased this thinking it would have a lot of great, old-time 1920's Charleston-like jazz. It is jazzy, but in a French-style ""reprise"". There are songs that are sung, but they are sung in French. The orchestra is not exactly a great-American jazz band, but a small, caberet-like band. This isn't the worst album for Charleston music, but definitely not the best."
4,"Three generations in ""el-lay""","Mr. Rodriguez attempts (with mixed results) to relate the story of three generations of one Mexican American family's life in working class Los Angeles. The center of the story is the steel mill which has provided the family with an income until its closure.Having grown up in Los Angeles, I enjoyed the descriptions of places and events which I can recall. The final section of the novel weakens slightly, but only because it seems to cover as much ground with a shorter amount of words. ***Get Ry Cooder's CD ""Chavez Ravine"" and play it as a soundtrack! ***"
1,Reading this book was like eating a cardboard box,"I typically will give a book 50 to 100 pages to get really interesting. With Sterling I gave it the entire book and what a waste of good ink. I enjoy reading junk mail more than this dribble. I typically enjoy Sterling and think he has done well for the craft - but this is a stinker. The Kid is uni-dimensional, Moses-Moses never reaches his potential to impact the story and Twice-borne rounds out a crew that never really endears the reader to struggle to the next page. The plot wanders around from one disjointed event to another without interest or credibility. I secretly hoped for a flock of flying talking dogs to carry them away from the floating island - anything to add some reality and substance to the plot. Thank death this book is out of print; someone has a brain. Sorry Bru everyone has a bad hair day once in a while."
4,"Hilarious, Delightful Early Bruce Sterling Novel","With ""The Artifical Kid"", a young Bruce Sterling demonstrated his excellence in writing comedic novels, to which he would return much later, in full force, in novels like ""Holy Fire"" and ""The Zenith Angle"", among others. While his second novel isn't nearly as polished as his later classic ""Schisimatrix"", it does explore in embroyonic form, some of the same issues of identity and what it means to be human, that he did quite remarkably well in his mid 1980s work. I couldn't help but laugh as I worked my way through the pages of Sterling's early novel, observing that it's nearly as funny as some of Harlan Ellison's best satirical short fiction. For anyone who wishes to understand Sterling's development as a leading member of the cyberpunk literary movement, then this early novel of his is required reading."
3,An anime-like adventure with hyperkinetic action.,"Sterling's The Artificial Kid works best as an adventure story with intense action, whose closest relatives would be Japanese anime pictures. He also tries to make this a novel of ideas (longevity, personality worship, identity politics), but they remain largely undeveloped. Nevertheless, its an entertaining book."
3,Early Sterling -- not best.,"This was actually Sterling's second novel. Involution Ocean was the first. Most people forget Involution Ocean because it was not cyberpunk. The Artificial Kid is okay, but weak for Sterling. His later works were much more imaginative. The Sterling completist must get this one. For others it is a good read but don't expect a classic."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A wealthy man indulges in a sociological experiment, but creating hisown personal corporate society. The incredibly wealthy live above theplanet, those not so, on it.The media is king, and a reality violence show is the mainattraction. This is sport by way of Rollerball and The Running Man, andthe best protagonist of this mayhem is The Artificial Kid."
3,"Not bad, entertaining","The Artificial Kid was a fairly short but fun read. The Kid himself is a great character and his friends were all pretty original as well. For the first few chapters it looks like it might be a highly entertaining adventure. After that it gets sort of bogged down and takes a new direction, but on the whole I found it worth the effort. I liked the various warring clans, the individual combatants, the follicle mites and the whole concept of televised (or the equivalent) combat art.Things I didn't like about the book (don't worry, nothing really revealing here): the Flying Island, Crossbow and the Chairman's transformation, a climax you wouldn't exactly call exciting. Also, the Crossbow Body was a pretty shaky and only vaguely accounted-for concept."
3,a lot like the rest,"much of what's been said in the previous reviews is true enough to be believable. not all talent for musical score and lyrics can be readily seen and brought to the surface in each cut but the band's attempt to master the process is evident. I always liked Quicksilver, from the early 70s when the west coast bands were touring the states, it was easy to catch a performance. highs and lows here and there are the accepted norm in any endeavor. good effort here."
4,A Nice Collection Of Music From Other Diamond Albums,"After reading the other reviews for ""Rainbow"", I was a bit surprised that no one mentioned this is a collection of songs from 3 earlier Diamond albums: ""Touching Me, Touching You"", ""Tap Root Manuscript"", and ""Stones"". This is not really a greatest hits album since most of these songs were not released as singles. Just a nice collection of Neil Diamond covers that work quite well together. However, rather than just purchasing ""Rainbow"", don't miss out on the 3 original albums these songs are from. All three of them are classics and Diamond at his best."
2,DO NOT BUY!,"I write this as a warning for all those who like their anime in a quality. As tantalizing as this ""box set"" may seem it is in fact, a bootleg or a crappy import. The overall video transfer, especially on EoE, is grainy and the sound quiet. The features and scene selection are just plain awful and it is obvious that it was done with little or no thought and the ending of EoE cuts out well before the final scene is over. Don't make the mistake of buying this as I did (off of Ebay), you're best bet if you want a decent format for the Eva movies then you might as well go with Manga Entertainment's releases."
2,Magritte video - not suitable for school viewing,"I ordered this DVD to supplement my surrealism project I teach to my art students. Good thing I watched it first! Magritte has SO many cool works of art....and yet the focus in this movie seems to be on his nude paintings. Several times the camera even zooms in for a closeup of the breasts!! I'm not a prude by any means, but come on. A couple of times they even showed a live nude woman....and I have no idea why they needed to do that. Shock value?Anyway, it's a useless video for my classroom. THe only views of the majority of his works are in passing in several art museum shots from far away. Crazy.Would not advise this for a classroom viewing."
3,good try!,"Magritte is such a powerful character and this video tries too hard to create something artsy. I mean a simple recollection of his life with a lot of time spend showing his painting (and more of his painting) would have suffice to make it a great watch, but instead the video team try to pierce the Magritte symbolism, as if the viewer couldn't think for themselves.Still a interesting piece for Magritte fan."
3,Intro to using Berries,"Narrow in scope, this cookbook is just one is a series published by Collins publishers. The pictures are welcoming and colorful. When you look at the images, you are encouraged to try the recipes. Ms. Kramis touches base with desserts, main courses, salads and appetizers among other things.Her secret is the little things, using zest and incorporating citrus juices with the berries. The author is from the northwest, where she has access to many types of fresh fruit when it is in season. For those of us that don't have this option, in some cases, using frozen fruit will suffice.I enjoyed looking at the various pages. I have tried a few recipes and am going to write down my favorites. I have many cookbooks and a limited amount of shelf space. At 95 pages, with at least a third of them pictures, I am going to donate this to the local library used bookstore so someone else can look at it."
2,What's wrong with this dvd,When I went to view this video the sound and video were in sync. Never had this problem with a dvd before!
5,THE BEST!,"An amazing amalgam of actors in their prime and a tight, well-balanced script makes for one of the best action movies ever. Lorenzo Lamas stars as ""Soldier:"" a head-case, former Special Forces cop who lives by his own rules. When his world crumbles around him, Soldier retreats to the only law he knows: his own. The action scenes are amazing, and the plot keeps you guessing from minute to minute. Filmed in the spectacular Canadian Eastern Wilderness, ""SNAKEEATER"" or ""SNAKE-EATER"" is a wonderful romp through the underbelly of human emotion and desire. Is there any greater commitment than love? Also not to be missed for the sake of hearing the beautiful and haunting title theme: ""Soldier."" ""Soldier...where's your sister...."" Another highlight is one of the Big Screen's greatest villains: The Dentist. Truly gorgeous. A hell of a lot better than ""Kill Bill 2."""
2,"Larry Csonka can be forgiven for his part in this lame 'actioner', the American Gladiator hadn't begun yet!","Zonk is cast as Sgt. Bronsky (a jew?)Det. in here with dumbo partner thatare trying to keep up with ex-Marine'Snakeeater' Lamas as he goes afterbad guys. With roles like this, it'sno wonder Lamas is M.I.A. these days!Funny bit with Zonk relieving himselfin coffee cup, putting lid down on itgiving it to wino, who begs $$ for cupof joe. Zonk tells him; ""Here friend,have mine."" Near end of movie, Zonkgets him again, but this time thevagrant tells him, ""No, you can't foolme again. This time I want sugar to putin it!"" Those are about the biggest lafsin this lame movie. But it was Zonk's1st movie role. Zonk has much betterrole in OLN Series, 'Larry Csonka'sNorth To Alaska', with ex-JacksonvilleBull mate, Audrey Bradshaw. Pls. don'task who the Jax Bulls were.

1,Very Basic Book,"I was looking for a good reference book for learning more about the Blackfin DSP family that covers hardware and software aspects (Assembler and C programming using Visual DSP++).Analog Devices has recommended the book Embedded Media Processing. Unfortunately, this book is very basic, covering just few hardware aspects that you can easy find in Analog Devices site.I really do not recommend this book for anyone."
3,Cute but handle won't work if too heavy,"My son loves his lunchbox, but I wished it could fit a water bottle, and if you put too much in it the handle won't stay on.BTW- you'll find this at Babies-R-Us for $9.99."
2,Can't use the handle.,This lunchbag is cute but when you have food (a sandwich and juice box) and try to hold the handle the bag flys open. the velcro is not strong enough to keep the lid closed. This would of been better if it was held closed by more than a piece of velcro.
4,Good product for the Batman fan.,Nice product - love the design...however it's a bit small. I have a hard time putting lunch and snacks in there.
4,"Smaller than expected, but still holds a lot.","I love this lunchbox! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I have not had any trouble fitting my lunches into it even with my unusual sized Tupperware. I don't see much purpose to the zipper bottom ""secret"" utility belt compartment and think it would have been better if that extra two inches was just extended to the main compartment, especially because it can make the bag rather soft at the bottom and want to tip over a bit. Besides, it's a Batman lunchbox, how cool is that?"
4,A lot of fun.,"This is a great lunch box for the Batman fan, is durable, and easy to clean. The only slight problem is that it tends to be a little top-heavy, so doesn't always stay upright when packed. But my son loves it, and I love the dual compartment, so his drink doesn't squish the rest of his lunch."
5,Very pleased with this holiday gift!,This was such a great gift for a friend and it arrived right on time for christmas! She loves it and I couldn't be more happier with the purchase or the sender for their hard work on getting it to me before the holidays.
5,Very roomy lunch kit and durable,"I purchased this Batman lunch kit September 2009 for my son who is a Batman hero. This is a perfect lunch kit, it is very roomy and the separate compartment for your beverage is perfect. It is worth the price, when i saw this item i had to have it. My son had his for over a year and this lunch box kit is made with strong material with a nice handle. Your little one will love it."
4,Jade Empire was Amazing,I loved this game! Character diversity and the art were wonderful. I very highly recommend this game. It was so good my husband and I fought over our turns to play!
4,False Advertising is BAD,"ok so right off the bat: this is a great game, I loved it. I beat it once and I'm goin in for seconds. But I have one major gripe. I am a big fan of being able to fully customize your character(Fable is one of the best examples of this), and according to the product description above, this is what Jade Empire offers. THIS IS A LIE. False advertising, I say. You get to CHOOSE between 5 characters. Yes you have control over their stats and what fighting styles they use, but you can't change their appearance, armor, or their voice(WTF is that about?? why does it say that??). Plus, you end up with damn near all the fighting styles by the end of the game anyway, so that customizable aspect kind of loses it's ""umph"". Don't get me wrong, I didn't turn this game off for a week after a got it, but I was expecting a Kung-Fu Fable, which it is not."
1,Have Not Received Yet.,"I cannot appropriately rate this game, because i have not received it yet. But looks good. I hope it is NOT a 1st person character play."
3,Strong Console RPG,"Although I like action games, I'm definitely more of a fan of RPG's with lots of customization and a deep storyline. I also generally prefer PC games to console games. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Jade Empire.There's not as much customization as with many PC RPG's; you pick one of 7 characters (4 different types, 3 mostly the same but for gender) with some preset characteristics but then you pick fighting style and allot points to body (health, strength), spirit (magic, healing), and mind (focus, weapons).Throughout the game you follow a basic storyline though the way you choose to finish the quests and subquests affects the outcome of the game to a point. The plot was rather predictable, though.I thought that the mix of RPG and martial arts was fun, but you lose a lot of what you would have in a game that is purely one or the other.I liked this game, but I don't think it's going to wind up in my list of all-time favorites."
4,ok game,bought for my daughter. She plays it some not as interested in this game as some of her other ps3 and xbox games. She does play it on occassion.
3,Lineage of Royals in Britain,Helps me to understand the lineage and who is related to who and when. Personal stories are interesting and I wish many had been in more detail. I enjoyed this very much and will keep in my people in British History section.
2,Not what I thought it was,"I missunderstood what this was about. I thought that it was about monarchs that had ""brief"" reigns. Instead it gives a brief overview of every English monarch. Actually quite boring."
2,Too much fiction in history,"I was excited. A brief summary of each and every English monarch. A little information about their reign, the highs and lows, a general overview.Unfortunately Ms Erickson seems to feel that history can be judgmental. She's also extrapolated from the record to slip in her own views of what's going on. I bought a history book that turned out to be part history and part fiction. Sorry, but I prefer my history straight.For those who enjoy history lite, this may be the book for you. For the rest, keep searching. Royal Panoply doesn't hold a candle to the record prepared by Sir Winston Churchill, and while I would like a briefer version of his History, focussed specifically on the monarchy, this particular title just isn't up to that task.In future I'll look at what else the author has published, and stay away from those who've strayed into historical fiction."
3,Review,Enjoying reading this book. It is suitable to pick up and just read one chapter if required or even use as a reference book for historical facts.
5,Duffy,"Beautifully written! McMurray shares with us his passion for the Empress and all of her history. He shares with us her majestic beauty above the sea, as well as beneath the sea. I never knew of the Empress of Ireland until reading this book, and I will visit her site one day. McMurray not only writes about the Empress and the divers that love her, but he makes the reader want to be included in that world, too. Thank you Mr. McMurray for writing such a touching story."
4,Enjoyable fantasy/fairy tale,"Although the Forests of Serre is not my favorite McKillip book, her stories are always a pleasure to read, and this is no exception. Her lyrical prose creates vivid pictures (I love the image of the witch running off with her house of bones!) and the story is beautiful and wonderfully strange, bringing to mind a fairy tale by the Grimms. I was a little disappointed, however, by the lack of intensity in the story and felt that characterization was sacrificed for story development. The characters don't seem fully realized and Sidonie especially seems like a caricature, as the beautiful, golden princess. Still, definitely worth reading for McKillip and fairy tale fans!"
5,An absorbing jewel of a tale,"In The Forests of Serre, McKillip has released yet another beautifully crafted story. I love her work so well, that I simply buy whatever she puts out immediately. Again, I was not dissapointed. Drawing me in swiftly, I would argue that this is one of her best so far. ""Ombria in Shadow"" left me desiring something, though it too was a lovely tale, but Forests has more than made up for it. Deceptively simple, her work will leave you pondering afterward. In a class far above most fantasy, I could argue that it be sold in the Literature section, rather than fastasy, as it is fantastic in more than genre."
3,"Lyrical, imaginative but missing something..","This would more like be a 3 1/2 or a 4 even on most people's scales, but I judge a little harder...A very enjoyable book by McKillip but far from her best work. The prose is as lyrical as ever, like reading poetry that scuplt vivid images of foriegn, strange worlds. The story itself is born from the dustings of the typical fairy tale, with some unique twists thrown in for good measure, and a fascination for a firebird. The characters never become emotionally involving however, and a few seem a little stiff halfway through but as with every book of hers that I've read so far, this one is also worth checking out, if only for its lyrical beauty."
4,Pretty Good Read,"I'm not an avid reader, however, I enjoyed this book. McKillip's writing style weaves stories as wonderful as the cover art. Her ornate details wrap you into the story itself. Like being next to Ronan as he realizes his boot is gone and he's wandering around half-mad with a frog in his hand, and hearing the toad correct him. Wonderful story. I'm just not impressed with McKillip's endings. The adventure is over with a happily ever after."
5,Pure fantasy,"Patricia McKillip is perhaps the msot consistent writer of pure fantasy writing today. She uses the common genre tropes (magic, dragons, unicorns, witches) and turns them into brilliant neo-fairy stories. I cannot recomend her books strongly enough."
4,Reads like a fairy tale,"I liked this tale. It was a fairy tale with fairy tales from different worlds interwoven within the story. Not to mention the fantasy world the story takes place in. The cover art is beautiful and sort of alludes to the wonderful make-believe land inside. A lovelost prince, a determined princess, ogres, one-eyed kings, dragons, aged wizards, etc. all lead you on a merry odessey of the human heart."
1,everything I do gonna be fuzzy,"True, we've been warned : ""This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com."" But we've also been told that this CD-R is supposed to ""offer the same audio and image quality"". Well, on the one I received, the cover was so blurry you can hardly read the name of the artist (and anybody would agree it's a shame with a cover like this !). But worst of all, the CD is full of ""bleeps"" and ""hiss"" that makes it impossible to listen to. Just a cheap copy. Come on !!! Buy a good printer and a decent CD burner !!! From now on, I'll stay away from ""CD-R"" and from this ""LRC Ltd"". Sorry to drop the big word, but looks like a scam to me."
5,Every song is a gem!,"I bought this LP years ago and now have the CD. How John Stewart has been overlooked by the general public is beyond me! Only problem is that whoever cut the CD wasn't paying attention...a few of John's spoken intro's are tacked onto the ends of the wrong songs. Oh well, for my money it's still the best live album ever!"
5,This is one of the best JS albums,What a wonderful CD. I have had it for years and I still play it regularly. John Stewart will take you on a virtual journey all through America. He makes you think about the important issues we have and continue to face as a nation and mix it with the best folk-rock music ever.
5,"Buy,Borrow or Steal it..if only for Pirates Of Stone County","john stewart. i love the sound of this name in voice and heart. all his albums are recommended by this fan, but if you are new to him, or introducing him to some lucky sod, this is a good one to use. and John, live long and happy, boy."
3,works at least:),"These speakers sounds good, but can't withstand alot of base. Alot of other reviews for any pyramid speakers all say the same thing ""you get what you pay for"" and their all telling the truth. I wouldn't buy this brand of speaker if you are looking for long term good sounding speakers, because they aren't. But overall not that bad for the price. They'll work temporary."
5,very enjoyable,"I have always been a civil war buff and Nick Canfield's All Out of Heart, brought me back to a time and place I can only visit in books."
1,Cheap construction or bad luck?,"This necklace is very pretty, but the chain broke the first time I wore it. I don't know if the construction was cheap or if I just had a defective necklace."
5,Great music,All the songs John McDermott sings on this cd are great. He has a wonderful voice and without a doubt sings with his heart. Great cd and a wonderful singer.
5,Excellent,"Intriguing historical account of MacNamara- what he was thinking, what he did not say during two administrations involved in the Viet Name war. Use of film footage and Philip Glass' eerie and ominous soundtrack further developed the power of this film."
3,80s Formulaic Tear Jerker with 80s Mullets & MTV Soundtrack,"It's a period classic and a decent flick. Most of the movie has a cheesy 80s soundtrack and the plot line is similar to innumerable other athletic movies where different personalities bond and try to win. If you want to see a vastly superior (and true story) version of the genre, see ""Miracle,"" starring Kurt Russell."
4,Good classic martial art,"If you don't like to always see fake martial arts movies then 'the best of the best' is a good choice to see some real life like fighting techniques, as three of the Korean Martial arts contenders are actually real life champions. Not that violent so you can watc it with your family"
4,Great Movie- not te right image.,"For a martial arts movie, this is a great one. I can remember watching this for the first time and dreaming about it. It was so cool. Now, I am a 3rd degree black belt in Taekwondo and currently manage a martial arts school in TX. I know the values associated with martial arts; Honor, courtesy, self-control, and perserverance, to name a few, are important to a martial artist in their every day life. This movie does not portray that message(until the end). It is mainly about revenge. If you want to see a great martial arts movie, please, go watch Karate Kid... the message there is far greater. However, if you want to see some blood, violence, and great martial arts.. this movie is for you."
1,what are you all talking about?,"This is one of the FUNNIEST movies ever made. Packed from start to finish with unintentional comedy... James Earl Jones pushing 300 lbs as a karate coach, Sally Kirkland breaking cinder blocks with flowing bleach-blonde locks, chubby Chris Penn making the national karate team and always wearing a cowboy hat. One of the evil Korean karate masters has one eye! Does anybody know how hard it is to fight with one eye?!Not a single casting decision in this movie makes any sense, the acting is laughable in every scene, and the plot is completely formulaic. But that is what makes it so enjoyable. I don't know what anybody else that reviewed this movie was thinking, or smoking at the time they submitted reviews, but I find it surprising, given the content of their reviews, that they are capable of operating a modern personal computer."
3,Terribly good and a painful reminder of eighties fashion trends,"OK, first of all, this is a good movie. If you are old enough to remember the eighties in the USA, the fashion, casting, and memes are all too well articulated to make you squirm with recollections. The soundtrack also harkens to the days of feathered hair and ""Eye of the Tiger"" style torch rock ballades with hilarious guitar motifs. The story is straight forward enough, if not a bit expedited. The fighting was on par for the day I guess. We've been terribly spoiled as of late. The acting is predictable and the storyline relatively formulaic, but somehow the movie holds together and just keeps spooning out the wet and soppy sentimental themes, but they don't kill it. So for some pretty unusual reasons, especially if you remember the eighties, I recommend at least sampling this movie to see if you get pulled in. I have to wonder what younger people who don't remember those times would think of it. They might not get it."
4,Classic for a Guy,This movie is decent. I happen to see it on TV when I was a kid and liked it because of the action. The acting isn't the best but it is a decent story with plenty of fighting action.
3,"Good, not great","After reading other reviews about this movie I decided to give it a shot, here is what I thought about ""Best of the Best""The action is mediocre at best, there are some good fight scenes - particularly toward the end of the film, but overall the scenes are a bit dry and cheesy. I thought Eric Roberts does a great job acting in this film and its a shame he never truly made it big as a top notch actor in the industry. I cannot call this a great action movie or even a great martial arts movie, if you have never seen it and you got an hour and a half to waste I say give it a try...ive seen better and ive seen worse, I would not watch a movie of this caliber more then once. Overall there is no way this is better thne a 6.5 out of 10, just my opinion."
4,Well Done!!,"This is a truly great martial arts film!! Good fighting sequences, excellent story line and surprising emotion from the actors throughout! A great movie for all ages! A classic for those in the martial arts community!"
3,Good Story. Weak Script,"It would be fair to say of this film, being made almost twenty years ago, with a pretty low budget, it holds it's own, despite it's weak script. The acting, anchored by the always brilliant James Earl Jones along with Eric Roberts and cast, is fine. But the film might not be too entertaining for a martial arts film fanatic. Unlike Best of the Best II, which I definitely recommend, the fight scenes here don't come as frequent and aren't as graphic as what might be seen in your average martial arts flick. But it's worth every minute to see Phillip Rhee's mesmerizing skills at work. Check it out."
5,Worth the Money,"There was some info I would have liked to have known before purchasing this video, but I bought it anyway and it's totally worth it. Here's some info not listed:SET LIST1. The Clock and the Storm2. Forever Longing the Golden Sunsets3. Song 34. As the Little Things Go By5. Here We Are (Family in the Hallways)6. Innocent Vigilant Ordinary7. Secret8. Peregrine9. Fishing the Sky10. Fight Song11. An Army of FirefliesThis video was shot with multiple cameras, nice, the sound is awesome, very nice. A must own for any Appleseed Cast fan. The early versions of the Sagarmatha songs are different from the album versions, which is also cool."
3,better then most other releases in 78,"while not their best work, it was better then most of the music being played on the radio in 1978. they set a very high standard that few have equalled.as always great playing and a variety of musical styles. i enjoyed it then and still do."
2,Strawbs fans don't rush to meet Deadlines.,"The Strawbs never really could decide whether to be a progressive rock band or just your basic pop-rock band. This album symbolizes that split personality perfectly - with the first half containing lame pop songs, and the second half getting a little more progressive. By this time ('78), The Strawbs had been cranking out albums at an incredible pace and sounded musically and creatively exhausted. Time And Life, Deadly Nightshade and Words Of Wisdom are about the only cuts worth listening to on this, their final major-label outing (they would be dropped by Arista after this album.) What is amazing, though, is that their two masterpieces - Hero & Heroine and Ghosts - still aren't available on CD in the U.S."
1,"One great song, one good song, seven fillers","I had been looking for the Strawbs' song ""Deadly Nightshade"" for almost twenty years. You can't imagine how excited I was when I found this album on CD. Once I got it, I can't tell you how disappointing it was. Made in 1978, when disco and pompous prog rock were king, this album lives up to that standard. The song that I was searching for is still excellent, haunting keyboards (harpsichord and organ), great bass line, eerie vocals, everything that I loved about that song. The rest of the album is very much like the worst aspects of Genesis and E.L.P. albums of that time period: cheesy riffs, pompous structures, and bad song writing. If you have ever heard this song, you will still probably want this disc, it's almost worth the $10 for that song alone, however, the rest of the disc leaves much to be desired."
4,Elastic core pull-on,"I am using the pull-on and it really helps helps my ankle. I had one before and when I went to get another I couldn't find one any place in town, so I was very glad to find it on the internet!! The ads were a little confusing...some places it said Two and some places it said One. I thought I was getting two for 19.98 so it was more expensive than I expected...esp with shipping"
3,effective for a short time,"This brace was effective for a time. The problem I had was that the elastic broke down quickly. The brack began to lose it's form and bunch up. As this occurred, the overall strength of the brace diminished and provided less and less support. I like this type brace for providing passive support of the tendons along the arch and bottom of the foot. This particular item from this particular manufacturer did not satisfy my needs entirely."
2,Seams puckered after first wearing,"Really disappointed in the quality of the brace...it does help my ankle some, but the area around the seams started puckering almost immediately, making it difficult to keep it smooth under clothing/socks..."
5,great teacher,"Some people have guilty pleasures like sneaking candy or closet smoking. My secret pleasure is to go to my yoga studio and listen to Steven Hartman tell about the Bhagavad-Gita. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. He has a way of relating this ancient text to our everyday lives. I learned so much. If you like Wayne Dyer, Marrianne Williamson and Dr. Chopra you will love this. I am going to order his other book in hopes I get as much out if it as this one."
4,Great value!,"I love everything about this bag. I am a nursing student and have lots of books and binders to carry in addition to my laptop (Apple iBook.) On a day with a heavy work load I can usually carry three books, each about 1.5 inches thick, as well as three 1 inch binders, all at one time. There is also plenty of compartment storage for everything from pencils to calculators. I especially like the clip located inside one of the pockets so that you can attach your keys to avoid them getting lost in your bag. I do wish there was more padding in the back so heavy loads weren't felt as much. I don't have problems with the straps slipping off, although the material on the inside of the strap is a little smoother than that of my other backpacks. Overall, you can't beat the price of this pack for the amount of space you get. I would definately buy another if the need arose."
5,Awesome Backpack,"this is an awesome pack! i am a 6th grader and i am in love with it!!! even though i dont have a laptop, i use that pocket for my 2 notebooks! it has so much room! i keep my school suplies in the bigger compartment and my junk in the 2nd one. amazing space! this pack also holds up well in rain, i have walked home in the rain for 30 min. and nothing was moist! u should by this pack! it feels really light, and i wear it really low on my back! what more could u ask for? the only down side is theres no pocket for ur cellphone but i keep that in the little pocket near the top.i would by it again if i needed to, but i dont think i will!its just a must by!"
5,"Great workout, one I can actually follow","This is the best workout video I've ever had experience with. Usually, I either can't follow them because they're too complicated or not taught well enough, or else they're way too easy. This is perfect! It's calming yet invigorating at the same time. After the first few times, you don't even have to watch the TV anymore. You can do it just by listening to his instructions. This workout has increased my flexibility, my patience, and my confidence. I can't wait to progress on to the next level, but according to the book, the first level should be practiced for at least 6 months before even thinking about going to the next level. Highly recommended video, all you need is a yoga mat and a quiet, distraction-free place to do the workout. It's about 45 minutes, and the book recommends doing it 3-5 times per week."
2,"Eh, too average","I didn't feel like I got anything from the yoga aspect nor the pilates side. The best of either discipline did not shine through. Furthermore, I don't think this video is appropriate for beginners. I myself am relatively familiar with both practices, enough so to know that he doesn't give adequate instruction regarding how to hold each posture nor does he point out many common mistakes to avoid. On top of that, the video goes pretty quickly - so if you couple the fast pace with the good chance of being left in bad form, I wasn't impressed with this video."
4,challenging,Did this video with friends on Thanksgiving break. It was challenging and I felt like I had a good workout and a little sore in places next day. Decided to order it for myself for days when I don't want to go to gym.
5,Excellent book to use for studying to take the A+ test.,I used this book and also bought the CD-ROM Practice test from Total Seminars. I scored a 95 on the Core Exam after reading the book twice and using the practice test's. I would recommend this book to any one that want's an inexpensive resource to study for the A+ Exam. This book is also a good reference for your book shelf. It explains topics clearly and completely. I will take the Dos/Windows test soon. I am using the companion book to this one to study for it and I am confidient that I will do well. Get these books and the CD-ROM practice test's.The CD-Rom can be ordered from Total Seminars. It is worth the money.
3,"Informative, if condecending, reference","The Core Exam (Accelerated A+ Certification Study Guide)is a thorough familiarization of the A+ Examination Core topics. At times it speaks down to you and insults your intelligence. However, this style does spoon feed you where you are your weakest. Passing the exams was moderately easy as a result of several readings of this reference. A solid reference well worth the cost."
2,OK,"I felt that this book did not meet the ""hype"" that my professor created for this book. Both he and another professor at my school raved about how good it was, although both myself and more thank 12 other students (in a class of about 20) were disappointed.First, the book contained too many grammatical errors--I found this to be quite shocking, especially considering that the author's partner is an english prof. I also purchased the study guide from the publisher, and it too contained a few too many typographical errors. Further, I found some of the examples in the practice problems to be inappropriate, given the weak explanation in the preceding chapter section's lesson.One positive comment I do have is that the approach or theme that the author uses from the very start of the book (using the ""simple society"") definitely indicates that the author made a sincere effort to reach his less-experienced undergrad audience. Perhaps the subsequent edition will be an improvement?"
5,too good,"I have never in my Economics studies read a book so simple, helpful and practical like this one. It has economics newspaper and journal excerpts to supplement the topics. It starts by explaining to the reader the economy from scratch (ie when there is no production or no firms) up to the complex stages that many advanced economie have reached by now. Although the structure inside might intimidate you, and of course its size, believe me the book is most READABLE! It covers everything on microeconomics, especially undergraduate. It is excellent!"
5,Best Hapkido Sequences on Film,"What all the other reviewers miss is the fact that ALL of the Phillip Rhee movies feature some of the best Hapkido sequences ever filmed. The only exeption would be the big brawl in ""The Trial of Billy Jack"", the only other known movie series to feature exclusive use of the martial art of Hapkido. Phillip Rhee is definitly a master of the Hapkido wrist, and arm locking and breaking techniques. He implements them perfectly and precisely. These moves are not made up, they are actually a part of the original form of Hapkido, which Rhee has a black belt in."
4,Best of the Best 2,I love movies and I had these movies on VHS but with the economy and the changes in electronics I had to get them in DVD with the better sound and pitcure quality.
2,BotB2: A Totally Different Movie,"After experiencing the lingering afterglow of a romance-fueled orgasm (in BotB1), it's funny how porn suddenly becomes a total turn-off. That's how this second in the quadrology made me feel.Unless someone can enjoy a technique (Rhee) vs. unskilled muscle (Moeller), I suppose.Unlike some movie franchises which was from the beginning centered on a personal character (Rocky, Batman, Vampires...), BotB1 is about training camp, team-building, athlete's mix of emotions (fear-ego-vengeful), major inter-cultural sports event, highly-skilled 'DaeHan'-like antagonist (rather than about Alex Grady or Tommy Lee).Now BotB2 is like a Jurassic Park 'sequel' about the painful divorce of Dr. Allan Grant and his subsequent alcoholic behaviors in spite of Malcolm and other JP characters are there to support him emotionally, and his encounter with a new love in his rehabilitation program and they both blaah, blaah, bla...I mean, where is the dinosaur?"
3,"The album deserves an ""E"" for best effort!","Jan, as always works hard at doing what he loves the best....his music"
5,Good box set of children's bible songs,"I have to say that in general this is a very good box set. It has every children's bible song I can ever remember hearing, and the music is nice. My little boy loves to hear the songs. Another nice thing is that the songs are listed on the CD's alphabetically, so if you know what song you're looking for, you can find it even without having the list of songs to look at. Don't get me wrong - this is no music masterpiece, but if you're looking for a good selection of bible songs for your child, this is it. I'm very pleased."
2,"TO BE WORTHY OF THE KUMITE SWORD, YOU MUST DEFEND THE TRUTH","Bloodsport 3 picks up where #2 left us in the world of Alex Cardo (Bernhardt). When his mentor and ""father"" Sun (James Hong) is killed by the evil crime boss Duvalier (John Rhys-Davies), Alex proceeds on a quest to find the great Shaman, Makato to find guidance. Makato teaches him to fully channel the energy in his mind and body in order to defeat the most vicious warrior-Beast in the next Kumite sponsored by Duvalier."
1,Dumb and Boring!!!!,"I just want to say, if u wanna see a great Bloodsport, get the 1st, its the best one."
2,Bernhardt needs work up his upper thighs.,"I'm not gay but Yeah, the plot was okay. However, Daniel Bernhardt was far too lanky and his upper thighs were very weak especially for his long legs. He can't keep his legs up in the air very long.FURTHER, his chest muscles hardly rippled. They were big chest muscles, but he never flexed them (if he could).email me: nbs124@bigfoot.com"
4,Great guide for helping your child thru the educ. system,"I have a ""right-brained"" child, now 14, who has struggled in the classroom. Michael's book was extremely useful in helping me to understand the different learning styles and my child, as well as understanding the teaching culture and how it changes as a child goes through the primary, middle, and high school years. Michael has armed me with knowledge to communicate with teachers in a respectful way that has positively influenced their perception of my daughter and her learning differences. When I win a the lottery - :) - I will set up a foundation to fund teacher training by Michael. Since that probably won't happen, I hope to one day bring Michael's work to the southeast through our education foundation."
1,Interesting Title but No Contents,Another hard-to-read book by Michael Grinder. I have bought this book from an used bookstore in Berkeley. Bad choice. The only thing I find useful in the book is the author's sincerity in making a positive change in the education system. Good effort but no deliverable results.
1,I had a problem with this book,"The main character, James is supposed to be 11, and most of the other characters are under 17.All them are constantly engaging in illegal behavior... smoking, drinking, vandelism.There a tremendous amount of verbal bullying by adults and kids. There is also a lot of physical bullying between the kids.There is also many instances of crude, rude and inappropriate behavior.The main character, James also engages in what I consider an age inappropriate physical relationship with a girl, sneaking into her bedroom for long and apparently intense makeout sessions.All of the above the author seems to imply is ""cool""The adults in the book either ignore or even endorse both the illegal behavior as well as the age-inappropriate behavior.I guess most of the above would have a certain appeal to a immature age level (especially boys) but there are way better books with this kind of plot where teenage kids are spys.Try the Alex Rider series or the H.I.V.E books."
4,a great easy read,Very easy reading that keeps you interested the whole way through. would recommend for holiday reading or mindless pick it up and enjoy it.
5,The Next Big Thing,When i just finished the hunger games series i decide to go look for a new series something with action comedy and painting a mental picture in a book those kinds of books are very hard to find today and i was looking for a new book and i stumbbled across the book CHERUB with in all caps with a griffin on the front of the book so i looked at the book fliped throuh the pages and i COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN i literly finised the book then the next day i am now reading the 2nd book the dealer and this seris is AMAZING if you are trying to decide what book i should get lets say harry potter and its maybe say the middle of the series and you need that extra something in a book GET THIS BOOK NO QUESTIONS ASKED
5,A GREAT BOOK FULL OF REALISTIC ACTION AND ANVENTRE,wow this book was really good. it was a great action but realistic book. one of my friends started reading it and i asked it if it was good and thay said it was amazing. i was unsure but decide to read it ad was not dissapointed.
5,The Recuit,Mr. Muchamore has gone out and written an excellent book in the Recuit. I would rate this a major 5 stars. It's fun and will keep your nose in the book until you finish. This is for young adults as there is mild language so caution. Peter Bell Tevis Jr. High
5,the recruit,"Im a 13 year who read this in two days and when i was finished i ran out to buy the next 6 in the series. the recruit is the perfect read for any teen or even adult who is looking for an action/adventure with some comedy. when you finish reading this youll wish it was real!!!!I have now read all the books in the series and Im excitedly waiting for the last one, Shadow wave.A must read for teens everywhere boy or girl."
5,Exciting thriller!,"The Recruit is about a kid called James who is violent but he doesn't mean to be. His parents didn't like each other so he lived with his obese mother, Gwen, who is the head of a shoplifting empire, and his sister, Lauren. His mother died so James went to a orphanage/boarding school. There he got into a lot of trouble so he had to go to jail. He was drugged and when he woke up he was in a facility called CHERUB with no idea how he got there. It turns out that this is a kid spy training facility. From there on his life is never the same, from impossible training to exhilarating missions. I recommend this book to young adults."
5,To rise above,"Michael Giletto has found what many seek. His book offers simple logical methods to change the way you view life. By raising your level of awareness and bringing about a closer harmony with the real inner self, the methods help you find the answers to the questions you may have about life. This book helped me to find the SOLUTIONS to what I perceived to be disastrous situations in my life. I also read his booklet, ""Pain, Identity and Astral Projection""."
2,photo on book cover,"a Christmas gift a few years ago and yes I have used a fewwonderful 'old fashioned' reciepes but ...no recipe for coverphoto in book, credits yes, on back cover but ...That photo was the HOOK that got me to read and use itand it's not in the cookbook dinner or anywhere"
5,Amish Cookin',If you like amish dishes this is a great book for you. Full of wonderful recipes and tips. I love it and I'm sure you will too.
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","Not a bad movie,,,I thought the fight scenes were impressive. However, the story I though was too ordinary, the outcome too predictable!! Nontheless, really entertaining, and importantly,,the picture and sound quality satisfactory!!"
1,Cheap Product,Two of the items in this product broke the first time they were used. They are very cheaply made. Don't waste your money.
4,Satisfied,This product worked well for my child. The music teacher was even swayed to purchase from this method for her personal usage as well.
3,Not a bad book but what's the point?,"As always, Eric Partridge does a first class job putting this book together. But why do we need a dictionary of cliches? Partridge says so that we know what phrases to avoid using at all costs. Well, if you're not smart enough to know the phrase you're using is a cliche, you're definitely not the type of person who will read this book.This book does make for a good bathroom reader, though."
3,Above Average Album Doesn't Live Up to Hype,"I bought this album with enormous expectations, given that it had received countless accolades as album of the year, including from Uncut magazine, which compared its style to the lush, multilayered sound of Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds. Buying it turned out to be a disappointment. While it has several beautiful songs(the first track is gorgeous), as a whole it is uneven and not nearly as artistically creative or adventurous as it has been credited with. Also, I dont know if it's just me, but I see absolutely no resemblance between this album and Pet Sounds. It seems nowadays that any album using more instruments than guitar, base and drums, and being remotely pop, is likened to Pet Sounds. Nonetheless, it is overall a good album, but there are many other albums released in 1998 more worthy of your disposable income. Purchase with caution."
3,Radiohead meets Nightmare Before Christmas meets Tom Waits,"I'm dreaming of a Goth Christmas. I'm not sure why, but Deserter's Songs reminds me of a mix between (again comes up) Radiohead's Kid A, and Nightmare Before Christmas. Oh, also, kind of Tom Waits, too. Wow. You're really not picturing this, are you? I like it. It's kind of obscure (there's a song about moles digging holes), but it's not depressing, and it's kind of cute. Cute in a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of way. I doubt I would have ever bought it on my own, but I got a recommendation, and I'm happy I did end up buying it. It's very pleasant."
1,"Disturbing, low quality and not worthy of one star","I bought this album with great expectations but was more than dissapointed. The instrumental use which is considered by some to be 'talent', is poor quality and unenjoyable. The vocals are awful and the album poor value. Not to be bought by those with sense and taste."
4,SECOND LISTEN HAS GROWN ON ME...I'M READY FOR A THIRD!,"I purchased ""Deserter's Songs"" about 3 months ago along with about ten other CD's. (Flaming Lips, Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Negativland, Zappa, Pavement...and so on.) Well...as fate would have it, I listened to every other CD I bought about 200 times collectively as opposed to the ONE time I listened to ""Deserter's Songs."" Well, for some reason I snaked ""Deserter's Songs"" from the pile of 30 next to my computer, popped it into my CD drive, and found myself grateful for doing so. This CD seems to have a linear ""build up"", the crescendo being the last track, ""Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp""; a downright toe tapper!! The CD's denouement is a hidden track that has a decidedly ""Bugs Bunny meets 'Old Man and the Sea'"" motif. Quite a great CD! Recommend it to your Bjork loving friends! Hell, recommend it to everyone...It's not THAT far out! (hence the four star rating.)"
3,A soundscape encapsulating the decades,"Seems to have something spanning over a mixed musical genre - from the 60's drug induced psycodelia through 70's lavish production 80's romatic pop and 90's newage. Influences (rip off some might say) from the Beatles, beach boys, Electric Light Orchestra (particularly ELO's dreamlike Eldorado). None of this is bad however, a nicely put together ambient sound - Goddess on a hiway being the choice track."
3,Not their best album,"I bought their first album Yerself is Steam. It is an absolutely fantastic album and is highly recommended. This album has received lots of praise and there are a few great songs on this but the rest of it is mush. They sound like they are getting old and stoggy. The songs ""Tonite it Shows"" and ""Goddess on a Highway"" alone make it worth buying but this is album is another good example of the British music press going overboard."
2,Boring Mediocrity,Do not waste your money on this. This is a good example of style over substance. The one or two good melodies are not compensated for by the interesting and pretty style of the music.
3,Rev Have The Lips On Their Mind,"I'm not one to shun a creative band like Mercury Rev, that is why I gave them three stars. It just bothers me that they sound soooo much like the Flaming Lips. The vocals are straining to sound like Wayne's. The beautiful orchestra swells are kind of a preview of the entire 'Soft Bulletin' album which is (sorry) far more superior. I still love the album and I can understand that Dave Friddman's work with the Lips, and plus the fact that their ex-guitarist is in the band, can lead to such comparisons. It's just that everytime I hear the band I feel like turning on the Lips instead. I feel soo bad."
2,The recipe was right...,"Lush pop arrangements and a focus on melody were what I was promised. I was so, so eager to buy this album. I didn't like it at first. That's fine; I didn't like Beulah, Tom Waits, or Sleater-Kinney on first listen either.After a year, I still dislike the album. I've forced myself to listen to it, hoping I was missing something. I don't think I am. The melodies are just boring. The arrangements are nice enough, but the melodies are predictable.The disc makes me wonder if this would be similar to Pink Floyd collaborating with 10,000 Maniacs. Glih."
4,Hazy,this album is definitely dreamy. There are no huge moments but a a steady slight twinge of light guitars and flowing orchstral sounds fronted by a quiet band. It reminds me of what Mr. Mackey on Southpark would hears inside his head. Hmm-kay?
3,"curiously beautiful, often somewhat bland","i am a major fan of the Rev--but this was a bit of a letdown. one gets the feeling that the band is overly relying on all the orchestration on Deserters Songs on account of they have slacked on the songwriting end of it all. there are moments of curiously beautiful soundscapes, particularly in the hazier dreamier passages, but, me, i would recommend that you get the earlier CDs and see just how much of Mercury Rev you can love because they make a mighty fine racket. better records that came out around the same time (in the same genre) are THE BLACK WATCH ""the king of good intentions"" and THE FLAMING LIPS ""the soft bulletin"""
5,very strange....in a good way.,"i love this album. it sounds to me like it could've been recorded in the early 70s. it's not a ""party"" record, though--you'll have to be patient. but once it gets under your skin, you'll love every second of it. how many modern records can you say that about?"
4,What a surprize!,"I haven't heard much of Mercury Rev's older material, but I'm sure it's not too much like Deserter Songs. This is a very theatrical piece of music with beautifully crafted songs that are immediately addictive. Upon my first listen, I wasn't sure if I liked the CD, but I couldn't wait to listen to it again to find out. ""Holes"" even though it is the exact same chord progression as Cranberries ""Ode To My Family"" is quite beautiful and haunting (especially if you picture Billie Holiday singing it!) Every song thereafter seems to come from a completely different entity, but they flow extremely well as a piece. Comparable to ""The Wall"" only for its dramatic ensembles and seemingly concept-like presentation, this is a CD that will take everyone by surprize."
2,"The icing on the cake, without the cake","I too was lured into buying this grand bit of nothing by the lock-step critical acclaim. While I agree that there are nice sonic touches here and there, and some of the instrumental bits are just this side of interesting, the rest of it sounds like Al ""Year of the Cat"" Stewart's big comeback record. Ugh. I mean, honestly, has it come to this?"
3,over my head,"I tried. All the great reviews, and comparisons to other bands that I really liked ... and yet this album did nothing for me. Quite listenable, but ultimately nothing struck me or particularly impressed me. Music as an opiate? Not sure what these guys intended to do on this album, or what is supposed to be ""genius"" about this music, but it escapes me entirely. Maybe I should try it again. It's been nearly a full decade since I listened to this one. But I tried that ""listen again with an open mind"" tactic with Jeff Buckley too, and wasn't any more impressed with it the second time around, so I'm not sure if Mercury Rev CD will ultimately click with me or not. Meanwhile, I'll stick with my Neil Young albums."
3,Mercury Rev - 'Deserter's Songs' (V2),"This is the band's fourth effort.Mercury Rev,at least on this CD reportedly changed from noisy psychededlia over to dream pop with more(how do I put it?)showy arraingements.In this case,it isn't all that bad of a choice.Tracks I thought were better are ""Tonite It Shows"",""Holes"",""The Funny Bird"" and ""Endlessly"".Also sort of liked the straight-laced ""Goddess On A Highway"".If you're in the mood for some new/er music that you might've not gotten to hear yet,this CD is a decent find."
4,Run-away success,"The American Dream - battered, bruised and more than a little threadbare, but still living on in Jonathan Donahue's mind. An almost tangible sense of melancholy and optimism imbues tracks like ""Holes"" and ""Goddess On A Hiway"", while ""Endlessly"" segues seamlessly into the chorus of ""Silent Night"". Rarely do musicianship and vision meet so well, and the results are frequently beautiful. In the words of the man himself, ""it almost makes me laugh, and always makes me cry."""
4,"Weird, but beautiful","Deserter's Songs is a record that will take many spins to fully realise. I can't say that it's one of my favourites simply because it's too left of center for me to wholly appreciate. I can often listen to most of the songs but have never played it from start to finish. 'Opus 40' and 'Goddess On A Hi-Way' are great songs, but 'Endlessly' is cloying. Regarded as one of the best albums of 1998. I'd say it ranks up there, but listen to it without those lofty expectations, and prepare to be swept away."
4,A Gutsy Transglobal Trek,"Leila Hadley defies the 1950's female stereotype when she takes off for Asia with her young son in tow. Leaving a prosperous career behind, Hadley is in search of more enlightening and meaningful experiences than her lush New York life affords her. She does very little in the way of planning, throws caution to the wind and hopes for the best. While the first part of her Asian adventure is quite comfortable and even luxurious at times, she dives headfirst into the adventure she covets when she hitches a ride aboard a sailboat with a small, all-male American crew. Her stories of her experiences sailing to remote destinations throughout Southeast and Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean are exhilarating and fascinating. Hadley's writing style is a bit haughty, however her stories are so interesting that this small flaw is hardly noticeable. Not the best travel memoir I have ever read, but an interesting tale by a gutsy traveler who was before her time."
5,Romantic and sweet,I loved this movie. It's too bad that in real life Hugh Grant has turned out to be such a disappointment.( Having two children out of wedlock sure isn't romantic. ) But these two were great together in this movie. Great story and you'll watch it over and over again.
4,A nice little movie,"Kind of interesting, though Julia seems to be just picking up a check in this one. She doesn't seem convincing as the star who falls for an ordinary guy."
3,It's okay,I love Julia Roberts but the story was not really very believable to me. And the ending tied things up too quickly.
3,Notting Hill,"A typical romantic comedy, with a few memorable moments and laugh-out-loud experiences, but not anything to get excited over. Acting=good, Plot=could be better, Location=very cute, Supporting actors/actresses=The best part! Still, it is a worthy watch i guess."
1,Hated It,"I absolutely could not stand this movie!!! The only reason I watched it all the way through was due to the false hope that it might get better - it only got more and more lame as the movie dragged on. Mediocre acting, boringly predictable plot, and no believable chemistry between Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant. Absolute waste of time, complete rubbish. -_-"
2,disappointed,"I had heard so many good things about this movie, but I didn't like it. The filming and scenery were lovely, but overall I thought the story was just not a great story - mainly because the character Julia Roberts played was so self-centered and rude, according to her mood. I had real trouble believing in any real basis for the attraction of the two main characters, especially after Julia Roberts' character had an extremely unjust and childish tantrum that rendered her character almost revolting. At the end of the movie, I wished Hugh Grant's character had hooked up with the ""nice"" blind date, who seemed a far better person and fit."
4,Not Julia's finest,"A thoroughly enjoyable movie and I highly recommend it in spite of Julia Robert's less than stellar performance. I have been a long-time fan of Julia so maybe it was the writing, maybe it was the directing, maybe it was the casting - but it is almost as if she would have preferred to have been somewhere else. Other cast members are spot-on for their characters and make the movie worth while."
3,Didn't quite hook me.,"This film definitely had it's funny parts which made me laugh out loud, although those parts mostly occurred by the supporting actors. I think that a successful romantic comedy makes you fall in love with the romantic couple. In this film, I didn't feel the chemistry between Hugh and Julia. She kisses him in the beginning for no reason. They didn't talk much when they were together. He obsesses over her, but we only know that because the supporting actors tell us so. This film had potential, but didn't quite hook me."
1,"Boring,very very boring","If you want to waste your money, go rent this flick first. It will certainly be worth the rental fee if you have insomnia. Probably will put you to sleep in the first hour. That is if you do not turn it off before you fall asleep. Nothing interesting in this movie except watching Julia pretend there is some chemistry with a bookstore owner who said 5 words to her. It just gets worse after that. Grants family and roommate are completely dull."
1,Predictable......,"I am generally not into chick flicks and THIS movie is one of the big reasons why! The characters were so phony, the plot was tired and the ending was exactly what I expected. Famous girl meets regular boy, they fall in love, the end. I don't even have to write a spoiler because every little girl (and grown woman) knows how a fairy tale ends...If this is your thing you will love this movie. On the positive side it's a very ""pretty"" movie with a beautiful setting etc, etc. Once in a while a romantic comedy or chick flick will get me going, this was not once nor a while, unfortunately."
2,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Wow! I never wanted a film to end as much as this one. I know now why it didn't get rave reviews in theatres. It takes forever to go anywhere and once it ""arrives"" it's leaves you saying, SO WHAT. The ONLY bright bit of acting in this movie was Hugh Grant ~ great in his stammering and perfectly-timed line deliveries and wonderful in the role of the well meaning, cheerful and simple fellow who falls for the unattainable lass, Ms. Roberts. Julia could have done much more with this role, but her performance left me wondering why she chose to play it like an actress asleep in front of the camera lens.Supporting roles were good, i.e., Grant's kooky sister and his roommie, Spike. The soundtrack is nice, and fits the mood of the story, but if you're looking for a Julia Roberts love story to end all love stories, I'd pass this one up and rent Pretty Woman instead. Sorry folks, just my humble opinion! She's a good actress and wasted her talent in Notting Hill."
3,a typical story,"The story was really a typical one. The only good thing about the movie is Hugh Grant, he acts well and he's very handsome !The picture and sound quality was not good at all."
3,Typical Love Story,This was a good movie but sort of your run of the mill love stories nothing reaches out and grabs you to make it any different from other love stories all in all it was a good movie.
5,great fun and possibilities,well it is not Battle of Algiers but as good as it gets in its genre! I particularly liked the Henry James Sequence and wondered which of his books they were filming--I can see both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts in a number of his novels--Wings of a Dove--Julia Roberts could do a great job acting against character and playing Kate Croy and Hugh Grant REALLY acting against character could play Merton Densher--why not? remember David Nivens did it
3,A feel good flick!,"Hello all- I thought this was a good movie, not great, but good. I like to watch it when I'm feeling a little down. It is entertaining, but holds no value other than that. There are some funny as well as sweet moments in the movie. It is really your basic love story and there are no surprises. If you like this genre of film, then I suggest you buy it. If not, then go out and rent it."
3,Four runaway brides who went up a Notting Hill...,"""Okay, here's the pitch, J.D.-we get Julia Roberts, right? And she just kinda plays herself, right? And Hugh Grant is the male lead, and..."" That's probably all the producer needed to hear before he okayed this project, thinking to himself (""We'll worry about a script later...""). I usually shrink back in revulsion when I see trailers for Julia Roberts films, but I must admit that if you just turn off the ""logic"" circuits in your brain, you'll find ""Notting Hill"" a pleasant enough 2-hour diversion. The actors portraying Grant's screen family are amusing, particularly during the obligatory ""meet my colorful and wacky relatives"" dinner scene. Roberts and Grant give thier standard issue one-note performances, hitting thier marks and flashing movie star smiles big enough to cover the gaping plot holes. Okay for a ""popcorn movie"" mood."
4,Good but too similar to 4 Weddings,"If you are a fan of 4 Weddings & a funeral, then you will probably like this movie as well.Filmed in the Notting Hill area of London, it pairs a famous American actress (Roberts) with a travel book store owner (Grant). Grant remains his quirky self in this movie as he has in previous movies. Roberts shows a different side of her acting by playing someone vunerable.The ensemble cast add to this movie but it is clearly Grant & Roberts who make it shine. You also get the typical British slang thrown in throughout the movie.Be on the look out for one scene that I found particularly interesting.... it's when Grant's character has been left by Roberts' and it shows Grant walking through Notting Hill as the seasons...and time change.The big plus to this movie is the interesting ways the director makes use of ""down time"" to show the characters getting to know each other or over each other."
2,NOT a flick for THIS chick...,"I would like to strongly disagree with the review written by a customer who called this movie a ""Chick Flick."" I would consider ""Notting Hill"" a flick only for chicks (and, what would the male equivalent be: dudes? guys? jocks?) with a high threshold for nauseatingly treacly sweet trash. I also disagree with the reviewer's insistance that the acting ""wasn't bad,"" since it was, in fact, absolutely dreadful. But worst of all was the trite dialogue, which suffered an execution that was more painful to watch than having one's tongue impaled with a dozen rusty knitting needles. My friends and I actually shrieked in agony as we watched Julia and Hugh limply deliver some of their insipid lines. Please save yourself the trouble and do Not, I repeat DO NOT, buy this video."
3,Expected more...,Although Hugh Grant was lovely (and the guy who played his roommate was funny!) Julia Roberts seemed to be reading off of cue cards. I just thought it would be a lot better...
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"There are NO Spanish subtitles on this DVD, even though the technical information and the cover claim there are. A major disappointment! The only reason why I bought the DVD versus the VHS tape was so that I could watch it with my Spanish speaking boyfriend. So be warned-- there are NO SPANISH SUBTITLES! (although the movie itself was touching) ;)"
2,movie revue for Notting Hill,"I watched this movie, but was bored and didn't care for a few of the characters. I thought there were a couple of good parts, but this would not be described as really good entertainment. Definitely would not watch it twice."
4,A film you can watch over and over again,"Ever since watching Notting Hill when it first came out I knew it was one of those films that was going to be one of my all time favourites!Unlike the ordinary romantic comedies where I can find myself getting bored, this had me entertained throughout! Spike was a character who had me in stiches and I thought the relationship between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant came across very believable.I would recommend this film to people who enjoy a giggle and also who enjoy a good love story and you don't even have to be a huge Hugh Grant fan to enjoy this - as I am certainly not!"
5,Love this movie,"I love this movie and can watch it again and again without getting bored. I love the actors, the plot, and the writing. It was a great mix of sweet, sad, and humorous. Even though my fiance actually doesn't usually like romantic comedies, she loves this movie too!"
2,"A predictable ""chick"" movie.","I only watched this movie because I was a prisoner on a very long and boring transatlantic flight. Otherwise I would never have bothered. The acting wasn't bad, but it was very predictable and both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant played their typical typecast parts to the hilt. I'm getting a bit tired of Hugh Grant's fumbling, ain't-I-a-kinda-cute airs. But apparently his affected charm is working. Julia Roberts stars as Anna, the beautiful, rich actress looking for the audience's sympathy for her terribly ""difficult"" life. I have a feeling that most women will love this sappy movie and will be running for the kleenex box big time! I would not consider buying this soap opera, but fans of Grant/Roberts might appreciate it."
4,Surreal,"That's how Grant describes his relationship with the actress portrayed by Julia Roberts in Notting Hill.The film uses Grant's formulaic hemming and hawing acting style that fans have come to expect, and rather enjoy. It's an unrealistic film, but that is what makes it so enjoyable. We're caught up in the unreality of it all.There are a few surprises along the way. Grant's character acts in ways that we don't expect a character to act. It all ends happily, but not quite in the way that we might expect it to."
5,The best,"Too busy to have watched this copy but have seen it enough times before and it's one of my favorites. Cheesy but when you're in the mood for it, it's the best!"
3,Notting Hill,"It has been so long since I saw ""Notting Hill"" I should watch it again. I feel unquailfied now to rate it. I probably enjoyed since it stars Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. But I don't really remember. Sorry about that."
5,romantic comedy,"I just have to say this film was really well done. I am a die hard Julia Roberts fan and loved her part as Anna Scott. I don't know, but it looked like love at first sight on anna and william's part. It was so sad to see how stars have so much trouble with relationships. William almost let anna slip throuth his fingers. Thank God the script brought them back together and finnally like the salt and pepper shaker when glued together, they would not part (got that from the movie ""Fireproof"")I was so glad it was a happy ever after for the both of them, true love won out."
2,"Should be called ""Nothing Here""","It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.Not since ""Intersection"" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard."
1,ugh....I can't believe people like this movie!,"Julia [is unacceptable] (as always), Hugh Grant plays the same bumbling but charming idiot he plays in every movie... SO predictable! There is no need for a love story to be soooo sappy and predictable! See Untamed Heart or Inventing the Abbotts for good love stories with an acceptable dose of sappiness and a LOT more reality. See Natural Born Killers or True Romance for my kinda love stories...!"
1,"Yuck, Oh and Also Dumb",Boring. Why is this a chick flick? This chick don't like it. But the roommate was a gas. Apparently Julia Roberts is so popular Hollywood would put her in anything vaguely resembling a story in hopes of making a profit. Do yourself a favor and don't see this one.
2,No Chemistry and a Gag-Inducing Moment,"I can't think of a movie where two stars had such little chemistry. Why Hugh wastes his time with the Julia Roberts character will remain a mystery throughout the whole movie. She continually reminds us that she just wants to be like every one else, but acts as if she if slumming it by hanging out with him and his friends. The corker is the nauseating lines she utters when she tries to repair things. BE AFRAID....BE VERY AFRAID - These words will not only make you terribly queasy; unbelievably she repeats them for good measure. The whole theater groaned and then giggled in disbelief. This sums up the whole movie. I gave two charitable stars only because I am a sucker for London."
1,Not for the USA,"I purchased this movie on-line, because I can never find it. It is my favorite movie, I had it on VHS but I no longer have a VCR.The DVD I purchased is apparently from the UK it does not work in ANY of my DVD players.This rating does not even deserve 1 star."
1,Boring,"I love british romantic comedy because I find them funnier than american ones. I love most american movies, but when it comes to love comedy the brits just do a much better job! The heroes are always quirky and no one is ever perfect and that is what makes it fun. I guess I went into this movie expecting to see something similar to Bridget Jones or Love, Actually and was very dissappointed. This is a boring boring boring movie. The best part of the movie was Hugh Grant's roomate who is a bit of a nut job, but all in all I found this movie predictable much like american love comedies. Bleh!"
2,Yuck,"Personally I thought this was a boring film with phoned-in performances by both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and what little plot there was had no suspense or mystery or charm whatever and the entire project lacked the style usually found in Richard Curtis' work. Even a strong supporting cast that included Gina McKee was not much of a boost. I usually go for these sorts of movies but this is one Britcom (very little ""com"" to it, by the way) I didn't enjoy."
3,HD DVD Notting Hill,"I bought it before the DVD war was over and got stuck with the wrong side. The movie in itself, I love it."
4,Romantic but weird,"I think this movie is so romantic at the same time it does not make a good sense at all. She sometimes acted as if she loved him. However, she already had a boyfriend which did not make sense in a way because if she still loved her boyfriend, I thought it was so odd when she ( Julia Roberts) slept with him( Hugh Grant)while she still loved her boyfriend. So, I guess both of them have done really good acting, but the plot itself is odd. Anyway, if you would like to find romance in your life from a boring life, this movie is very good for that."
5,A great film you can watch over and over again,This film has to be considered as one of my top 10 ever and a film you can watch many times over. The story is a simple one but the cast is excellent with great characters who bring out the best of the story. Put this together with the music and you have a great feel good movie. Highly recommended.
4,My new favorite movie,I loved this movie for many reasons. I loved Hugh Grant's friends and how supportive and real they were. The dinner scene with the music is the best in the whole movie but when Spike (after being a fool the entire movie and unintentionally ruining Hugh and Julia's relationship) gets out of the car and stops traffic still makes me smile. I loved this movie because it is the woman (not the man) who messes up in the relationship and that is nice to see for a change. I loved the music and the soundtrack is even better. The scene where Hugh is walking down the street is brillant. I love this movie!
4,English humour,"If you are a ""fast food"" video watcher, don't take this one. But if you are someone who takes the time to watch a video and enjoys the subtleties of English humour, you will have a great time. I've seen it twice and wouldn't mind seeing it again!"
4,make a thirty year old cry,"kind of cliche, but kind of not, kind of sappy and sentimental, but just so much fun. The dinner scene was so well done, the walk through the gated park, the ending, so special.....I usually loathe films like this....I LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT....watch it!!!!"
4,The attraction of opposite ways of living!,"This is a charming story about a love story of the Nineties. It is filled of spontaneity and freshness. Julia Roberts has never been one of my female icons, but I must acknowledge she has never been best in any other film that I remember. The sexual chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was immediate.The script is filled of very funny and inventive situations in the best tradition of the British Comedy."
1,the horror...the horror....,"I saw this movie on a transcontinental flight and was ready to ask for a parachute about halfway through. How this ..., lifeless exercise in tedium made so much money and managed to garner so many stars here screams for a new episode of ""In Search Of."" In this case, it could be called ""In Search of Entertainment."" Julia Roberts plays a nice Julia Roberts (although I find the nasty Julia Roberts at the last People's Choice Awards more interesting). Hugh Grant continues his bumbling, stuttering English fop routine. There's a ""zany"" roommate. One of the ""big laughs"" is the sight of Hugh Grant sitting in a movie theatre wearing water goggles...the horror, the horror...I could've used a entire roll of film like toilet paper and run that through a projector and made a more interesting and entertaining movie. I give this movie five squating dogs."
2,Boz's Review of Notting Hill,Notting Hill is a very overrated and mediocre film. 1999 was a very strong year for films but this was not one of them. Roberts and Grant played themselves and that is about it. Its a wacky British drama that is totally unrealistic and not very believable. I was glad when it was over. No movie star is going to pick up a book seller in England and then marry them. I agreed with the film's portrayal of the media but that was done better in films like Network and SFW.
4,Pleasantly Suprised!,"Not being a Hugh Grant fan and not being a Julia Roberts fanatic I didn't even bother to see this movie when it was released in the theaters. But I was glad that I rented it. It was a pleasant romantic-(semi)-comedy movie. I found myself feeling so sorry for Hugh's character and Julia's had me up and down, in and out, liking her and disliking her. Both did a fine job but this poor man was a glutton for punishment. It's like that when you are in love, hopelessly. You keep going back for more and more rejection, followed by hope (can you tell it didn't work for me?). Anyway - after I saw the movie I was enchanted with it. A very good movie and a nice suprise."
4,"Good movie, great video quality","I wasn't too sure if I would like this movie before I saw it, but it was very good. I found this movie to be quite humourous, as well as very moving. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but the great acting coupled with the super audio and video quality make this a winner in my book."
2,4 weddings warmed over,"I just sat down and watched Notting Hill again to try and see what I missed the first time. Result: Nothing. It is a warmed over (well slightly overdone) Four Weddings and a Funeral. However the latter film had better writing and casting. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts anyway, but the sister in Notting Hill was a feable attemt as was the ""Bernard"" Character. The only asset Notting has over 4 weddings is the soundtrack. That was a greatly missed opportunity."
4,Hill Surprises with Depth,This is an incredibly enjoyable film. Unlike many other romantic comedies this one succeeds in bringing to life an entire cast of interesting characters beyond the wonderful romance story. The cast of friends has a wonderful warmth and humanity about them. I found the film witty and fresh. The DVD provides excellent bonus material including an original look at behind the scenes where Grant takes you on a tour where you meet his real parents. The deleted scenes were interesting.
3,Romantic and sincere,"I've wanted to see this film for ages (i secretly like the occasional romantic comedy) and I had no preconcieved ideas what the plot was going to be about. I thought it very well done, with just the right amount of humour and romance to make it an entertaining but not over slushy movie. Huw Grant as usual playing a well spoken English gentleman, who falls in love with the wonderful Julia Roberts, who plays a very famous filmstar who he accidently spills orange juice over on a London street. This sparks a chain of events that will give him the opportunity of either everlasting happiness or heartbreak. It's not an amazing film, but has a very endearing side and a perfect evenings entertainment if there are people in the room who can watch non-action movies, you should definitely see it."
1,Are You Sure It's Not NODDING Hill?,"This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G! Sure the movie was sweet(I guess) and it gets you thinking (kind of), but it was a million paces too slow and I would generalize it as weird in an ""oh, come on..."" kind of way. But hey, if your into semi-romantic, unrealistic movies and enjoy looking forward to the end...go for it!"
2,Disappointing,"The only reason this movie gets a two instead of a movie is because Julia Roberts is in it. Too bad she didn't have a good story line to work with. Waste of film. Save your money. This is one of movies that you watch on tv and say to yourself, ""boy am I glad I didn't pay to see this movie""."
2,Somewhat romantic but very unhumurous.,Julia Roberts character to me was so unsympathetic that I didn't feel that she deserved to be with such a nice guy as Hugh's character is in this film and I was personally hoping that Hugh would stick to his guns and not go crawling back to her because the way she treated him was not very nice.My girlfriend thought that Hugh's flatmate was funny. I found him to be ignorant and boorish in the extreme.If you want to see a romance check out 'Somewhere in Time' with Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeves. Or for romantic comedy I recommend 'Doc Hollywood' starring Michael J Fox and Julie Warner.
2,Ending rips off 'Roman Holiday'. Second hand stuff.,"None of this rings true, a sentiment apparently endorsed by Roberts who did not believe in a lot of her character's actions, especially over the old photographs. This may explain the lack of chemistry between the two stars and Robert's curiously stiff and un-attractive performance. I didn't believe in the press scrum outside Grant's front door, either. For a start, the police wouldn't accept an obstruction in a narrow street like that, but I won't carp on. There's the odd laugh."
5,Notting Hill,"This is such a wonderful movie...I have seen it 3 times, and love it even more each time I see it. It is funny and romantic, and just overall one of the best movies I have seen... It is a ""Pretty Woman"" type of movie...Just Fantastic!"
3,Pretty Funny!,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend and mom. I was hesitant at first, but ended up liking it. I did not like Julia's character though. She was very mean. I actually hated her in the movie. The best thing about the movie was Hugh Grant's roomate. He stole the show, he was hilarious."
5,Shocked,"I cringed when my girlfriend plucked this DVD from the shelves. While the thought of Julia Roberts was somewhat intriging, I did not want to find myself listening to Hugh Grant for two hours. By the end of the movie I wanted more.This is really a great movie, quite unlike anything else that has been released on a long time. Roberts and Grant are a wonderfully romantic duo on screen. Every detail of this movie was perfect. The neighborhood, the friends (especially the roommate), the bookshop, and of course, Julia. During the middle of the movie she smiles at Grant and it is a look that any and every man wants to receive from a woman.The music is also a surprise. It is rare that almost every song in the movie is one that you remember from some trivial point in your own life.I bought this shortly after viewing it for the first time. It is a film you can over and over and really never tire of."
2,"Waste of TIme,","I was thorougly dissapointed with this sad excuse for a film. Iam a huge fan of the very talented Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, whythey choose to do this sickeningly sweet and eerily UNFUNNY picture mystifies me. The plot is thorougly farmiliar. The main flaw is that the Julia Roberts character is THOROUGLY unlikeable! The film drags and drags. There is even a chase scene which rips off Nine Months. Go for classic Hugh instead."
5,marvelouslywonderfullyromantic,"I could not think of one word to describe this movie. If you are a romantic nut like i am you will love this lightly whitty, suttlely spicy lovingly romantic movie. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HUGH GRANT COULD BE FUNNY BUT HE IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER,"
5,Notting Hill,"The DVD arrived early and was in the condition promised. I had seen the movie before, but I really loved the story line of the movie."
5,One of my Favorites,I am a big fan of Julia Roberts and this is one of my favorities...Great shape and fast delivery at a perfect price.
5,Who is Rhys Ifans ?,"One thing I admired about this movie was the great British Supporting cast. Much of the cast is a ""yuppie"" british version of thirtysomething, who play William (Hugh Grant's) friends. However, one cast member, Rhys Ifans is Spike - William's flatmate. Simply put, SPIKE STEALS THE SHOW.Rhys Ifans is brilliant in his portrayal of the grungy Welch flatmate. He is worth the price of this movie alone. I think we will hear a lot from this man in future films.On the DVD, Spike plays a key role in the deleted scenes.Hugh Grant is brilliant in this movie. I'm a BIG fan of his!"
1,Nothing Here,"A film in which a highly-paid and quite famous female actor plays herself without irony. It's beyond tasteless. That she was undoubtedly paid very handsomely for her ""effort"" is equally unironic and injurious."
1,Julia Roberts,"Okay, this is a clear example of a movie with great actors and actresses but a weird plot. Actually, I can't tell you much about his movie because I fell asleep. Yep, I did! I watched it but it just got soo boring.; You people out there LOVE Julia Roberts but just because she's in a movie doesn't make it good. This was a lame excuse for a movie that would hopefully sell a lot of tickets by getting Julia ROberts in it. It was not very good at all. And there was no earthly way to understand it. Who cares if you don't understand my review, I don't understant Notting Hill!"
2,Notting Hill,"Unbelievably, Hugh Grant turns down Julia Roberts and the next moment he's announcing this to a roomfull of friends. They, without too much effort, convince Grant that he's made a terrible mistake. Then, they all immediately pile into a car (including his friend's wife in a wheelchair) and race to Roberts's hotel, breaking every traffic rule along the way. Couldn't Grant have quietly come to a realization without involving his odd circle of friends? And couldn't he have gone to try to see Roberts without dragging them all with him? I think that's what an American leading man would have done. This was an obvious effort to ""build up"" the ending, using all of the supporting characters. It was needless and you can see right through the scriptwriter's intentions. Also, my apology to Rhys Ifans, but I think he actually hurt the film and should have been left on the cutting room floor. He made the film hard to take seriously, which I really wanted to do."
1,I hated it!,"If you took all of the dirty jokes out of this stupid movie it would be ten minutes long. This is a disgusting, and lame movie. Who would run into a mega-movie star and spill orange juice all over her and then say ""it was surreal"". There was probably four funny parts that I remember and the rest was sick (underline the word ""sick"" please). Hugh Grant is a drip, and Julia Roberts has a lot of talent which was completely wasted. I would have minused it 10, but the computer wouldn't let me!"
1,not this time,"i really waa excited about seeing a romantic comedy and it was just a disapointment. the story was kinda dragged out until near the end and then eveything became so sudden and happened in the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. the ""budding"" romance between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant to me was not real...it just didn't seem touching."
2,Lame,"I'm opting to join the rank of the two star-ers (new word). I can't go down to one because technically (as in the use of technology) the movie is sound. Pity they didn't add some acting. Basic boy meets girl, loses girl, regains, loses, regains, loses - I lost track. I think so did Grant and Roberts. Underlying the relationship is... Nothing. There is no reason for this couple to do anything together, no case is made other than undying (but missing from evidence) passion. Get it from Netflix if you must watch it."
4,"Finally, a copy!","Pays to have a copy of your fave movies, and this one is part of my not so long list in the romantic comedy department. =] It was shipped within the time frame given and packaged to protect the DVD. This copy includes deleted & behind the scenes, production notes and a lot more. It is competitively priced. You may find other online offers that would be cheaper but who knows about the reliability of those sites and the quality of their items. Anyway, happy about this order!"
2,Julia Roberts is overhyped,Would have done better if they had used another actress besides Julia Roberts. She can't act. Has anyone else noticed that she's the same character in every movie she acts in.
1,Excruciating...,Hugh Grant is wasted and Julia Roberts plays an unappealing shrew in this waste of celluloid. I blame the script and the unconscionable 2+ hours running time. The dialogue is utterly dreadful. The comedic bits are few and far between and usually fall flat on arrival. Really hard to sit through this.
4,Witty snapshot of relationships among decadent academics,When I first saw this film I was a faculty member at a Canadian universty- the insights on society and relationships are hilarious and ring true.
1,"Talk, Talk, Talk, Talk, No Action, No Plot","I keep being surprised at the praises this film has been getting. This film is the epitome of talky. I kept listening to their conversations and asking, ""Okay, when is something actually going to happen?"" I got an hour into it before I couldn't stand it anymore. It's limp, stagnant, and boring, one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I didn't find their talking of their sexual escapades interesting. I didn't find the characters interesting. The film offers nothing but sheer boredom. The only value this film had at all for me was the fact that it's in French, which is a language I'm learning. However, that's not enough. I could only take so much tedious babble before I had to just shut it off. It's not worth it when there are so many high quality French language films out there."
4,"Fun, uneven, choppy","""Decline of the American Empire"" is a difficult movie to define, mainly because it straddles both European and New World cinematographic tendencies (i.e., ponderous and talky on the one hand, ponderous and talky about sex on the other). Briefly, it's the story of four or five friends who, with one exception, discover that their relationships are in decline -- disintegrating because they come to know more and more about themselves and their lovers. Is it supposed to be some complex metaphor that somehow ties back in to the movie's title? That's never really clarified. But the dialogue is fun (Quebecois French, English subtitles), and the characters aren't sympathetic enough to make you feel sorry for them, so you can, in a detached way, enjoy their suffering in this offbeat comedy drama farce."
1,this is not what I thought I was buying,"If you look at the title it says""hard cover"". However what I received was a set of cassett tapes that only work on half of the material. What is worse is this material comes from England and it is more costly to return than what it is worth."
5,Spectator Golf at it's Best,"I bought this book many years ago. It is a rare writer that can make an interesting story from a round of golf. The Hacker will love it because PG provides characters who are very human and make the same type scores. The love stories are priceless. I'm glad they decided to reprint this great book. Any romantic soul will cherish these stories. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy them. The stories are short enough for a short bedtime reading. This isn't a ""Tin Cup"" type book, the stories could happen. Buy this book before the reprint is sold out.Someday I want to be ""The Oldest Member"""
4,A concise comprehensive review of Bonhoeffer and his beliefs,I am beginnig a series of lesson s on Bonhoeffer and found this volume to be invaluable as a course material.
1,Not getting what I purchased,I paid $44 for a new book when it was delivered to my son he was not able to except it do to the fact it was used . I did not get a refund for the difference. I feels this is fraud.
5,VHS or Beta - An Obvious Choice,"VHS or Beta - What an amazing first full album effort. I love the Post-Punk inspired guitar styling (ala Gene Loves Jezebel) and the pounding bass lines (ala Shriekback). Obvious comparisons will be made to the Cure because of the vocals, but VOB share other sonic and structure similarities with the Cure as well. They have updated this post-punk revival sound with the sound of techno-disco (ala Blue Six) and House music (ala Underworld). 4 of the 10 songs are instrumentals (ala Dif Juz), which takes courage in this vocally dominated market. VOB are fresh, energetic, and danceable, and they let their guitars sing. If they maintain their musical and creative integrity, they can become post-punk legends.Compare to:The Cure, Gene Loves Jezebel, Shriekback, The Bolshoi, Dif Juz, O'Rang, Underworld, Wire, Chameleons UK, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand"
4,Puts a funny smile on your face,"It's an odd album - where does it fit? Daft Punk? LCD Soundsystem? Kind'a in between? Either way, it's punchy and great to listen to. It will often make you wonder if The Cure had something to do with it at times.Some of the tracks are a little off (like the last one - 'Irreversible' - seems to go nowhere fast at times) while others are catchy/hard synth-popped instrumentals. A real fave is 'Dynamize'. You can't play this one loud enough, and if driving, watch how fast you're going."
4,VHS or Beta Rox!!!!,"I saw VHS or Beta last night at the Louisville Palace and they rocked! I came to see Duran Duran (of course) and don't usually enjoy opening acts, but these guys were great! From the first word out of the lead singers mouth, I thought of Robert Smith of The Cure. Some people are suggesting that comparisons found in the music/sound to older bands are a bad thing. I disagree. I think it's refreshing in comparison to 95% of the music being played on the radio these days. After all, isn't imitation the highest form of flattery?I will definitely be following these guys closer from now on and you should too!P.S. I am from Louisville too."
3,Some great songs...,"If you love their single, ""Night on Fire"", you'll probably like a few other songs on the album as well. The album is very upbeat, almost in a bubble gum kind of way. It's a bit sweep for me. But if you like dance rhythms and energetic music, this could be right for you. I just don't find myself reaching for it very often. I probably should have bought the single and stuck with that."
4,The Cure of the New Generation,"Although i was introduced to VHS or Beta because of their remixed songs, i must admit that they are a truly awesome band. Reminds me of The Cure during the 80's. Cannot pick a favourite track but ""You Got Me"" and ""Nightwaves"" are up there. I also saw them in concert during Bang! down in Miami and they are very good. Check them out!!!"
3,Seems to work well,"I use this as a drink and lunch cooler in my office, which a pretty tame environment for the compressor to work in. The unit works fine for cooling my soda, but if you need it for real refrigeration this is not the ticket - it has a digital temp display and the coldest I've ever seen it get is 49 degrees. It averages 50 to 51 degrees.UPDATE - the 12V conversion unit keeps dying - this is a good travel fridge, but I'd look elsewhere for a dorm/office unit."
4,more crippled action,"4 men all punished by the same man join forces and learn the crippled fighting style in order to combat his devils palm. Not the most outstanding kung fu cast, but they do more then enough to keep you interested. I liked this film alot. Some great humor, and some great fights, what else do you need?"
1,bolt holes were too far a part,The bolt holes did not match my tranny. The mount was well made. I was in a hurry and did not checked to see if it matched the 4 speed that came on the car. I'm using it with one bolt till the weather gets better.
4,"Very, very detailed...",This book is a much needed book for anybody interested in Japanese history. It gives a very detailed account of the policies of the ruling class while at the same time showing the development of the large cities and their free labour market. It shows that Japan already had a large unrban working class before the morden period. The author also gets into the social history and the beliefs that many of the ruling class had about servants during the same period.
2,Flimsy,"Had mine for about eight years. Sounds like a long time, but I can practically count the number of times I used this. Ultimately it was mushrooms that did this in; first one wire came out then another."
2,"Solid slicer, but doesn't cut wedges","I thought this was a great concept - until I tried to make wedges. There is a good reason the real wedge cutters have long handles: the wires need to descend on the egg straight on, which they don't in this compact version. So I get weird curvy unequal wedges. Turn the egg wedges and slice, and it does a decent job of chopping for egg salad.I've had no problems with the wires slicing mushrooms or strawberries, but mine doesn't get extremely heavy use. Because the wires appear attached with screws, I'm hoping when the wires DO loosen or break, I'll be able to tighten or replace them.Bottom line, seems solid, and slices well, but it doesn't cut wedges. I'd be mad if I'd paid more than $10. 2 stars, because it simply doesn't do what it says!"
3,"great concept, just not as good as it looks","Egg Slicer with 3 slicing stylesIt will do great with eggs, but not strong enough for strawberries. I've destroyed the wires on 2 already, I keep getting new ones because the concept is great and I haven't found a better slicer"
1,How bad can you get??,"This so-called ""musical artist"" is the worst singer and songwriter ever. His high-pitched voice is terrible annoying, and the keyboard-guitar sounds are awful. Undercover Funny is the worst song I have ever heard, and I heard of Atom and his Package from a friend who was showing me this song. We laughed at it, not for witty lyrics, but for how bad it was. Everybody I know hates it. ..."
4,He's a good artist,"Atom is not the most talented musically, but he makes up for it with his lyrics and catchy rythms that he creates instead. His songs can be just flat out weird and funny and some of his songs have complex views on Todays society. He is very smart and it comes through in his music. I reccomend this cd is your into something different and have eclectic tastes."
2,Very Poor Quality,"Our eleven year old grandaughter loved this watch we gave her for her birthday. She loved the style and the color and it fit well. But, a little over a month later the digital numerals stopped working! This is the second watch I've bought from Amazon that died within a short time. The first(a different brand) came with no directions so it was impossible to set :( and while this looked great and came with directions, another watch that stops working after a few weeks is of no use. Guess I got what I paid for. Lesson learned--no more buying watches from Amazon."
4,Super Sturdy Watch for Little Girls,"This watch was a Christmas gift for my 5 year old which she fell in love with! The easy to read digital face alleviates the constant ""What time is it?"" question, and the indiglo feature is fun at bedtime. She keeps it on in the shower, as I do with my own IronMan. Her only problem is that she inadvertantly hits the chronograph button and has a hard time getting it back to regular time. I think she'll figure that out as she gets a little older, and I have no doubt the watch will still be ticking along with her!UPDATE 5/12/2012:This watch is still running strong and we have yet to need to change the battery. The band is frayed a bit, but c'mon...my daughter is 8 now and it still works!"
1,Not even worth one star!,"I would give it No Stars, but one star was the least I could give this watch. The band/strap is too long and the watch does not fit an average 9 year-old girl. After reading the instructions three times, I was still unable to set the date on the watch. It kept going back to the time setting which had already been set. If I still had the box I would return the watch! Even at the low cost, it still doesn't live up to the advertised functions."
4,Great for a kid,"Great watch overall for an active kid. The numbers are big. The indiglo is great for our early morning run. My 9 y.o. daughter was able to do everything herself - set the time, alarm, countdown, etc. The only complaint is that the band is a bit large for my daughter's wrist. As for durability, we're into our 6th month of swimming and running. So far so good. BTW - she really likes the animated runner/swimmer/biker on the watch face."
4,Great Watch,I purchased this watch for my daughter to help her get started with a running program. She loves the watch and the pink color.
3,Strap is a major problem,"Functionally this watch is great, a young girl (say, 7) can understand its functions and the timer and alarm all work fine. The reason this is getting 3 stars (and that's being kind) is that the strap when done up around that same girl has its end sticking up. This is because her wrist is small (even though above average dimensions for age)and so only half of the velcro attaches, with the rest stuck up at the top. There is also a huge TIMEX logo in the way of where more velcro could go. As a result the strap comes easily undone.This is frustrating because it's such a stupid oversight on Timex's part. If not for that logo in the way they could have had more velcro and then no problem. I have had the same girl try an adult female timex with a rubber strap and lots of holes and it actually fits just fine, so that's the one this will be replaced with.Timex, fix the strap and actually allow young KIDS to wear it and then you get five stars."
2,Disappointed being it's made for a child,"My daughter loved this watch, however, it is not made to withstand any sort of accidents. She had it only a month and accidental dropped in on the kitchen floor, it's linoleum... not hardwood or tile and the watch went haywire, started running random numbers and the function buttons will not work at all. Basically it's toast. Appears it is not the battery since the display still shows up. Being a kid's watch, you would think Timex would make it more durable than this! I bought it due to the Timex name in hopes it would be made to last longer than a few weeks.My son has a fossil watch and he smashed it up when he feel off his bike onto the concrete. It's scatched up a bit but still works perfectly."
5,Timex kids watch,"Great value, my daughter loves it although would be nice to have more colour options. The watch is easy to use especially the buttons which are easy for a childs fingers to push."
2,Quality very low,"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She was very happy with its looks and found it easy to understand and operate. I thought it felt a little flimsy and cheap...but hoped for the best. When I set the time for her, I found that the buttons felt weak- like they would break if pushed too hard. Its light feature died by day 2 :( Timex used to be a lower costing, but solid watch. I expected more from Timex. This is one poor quality little watch. I have seen better watches in happy meal boxes. Very sad product."
4,Nice watch.,My 8 yo earned herself a watch this is the one she chose. She wears it every day. The band is a little big.
5,Price,"The watch was a good price and had free shipping. My granddaughter loves to run and swim and it's held up well. It's easy for her to use, she's eight."
2,Fix the Strap and Durability,"This watch has been pretty good for my 8-year-old daughter, but it just broke. I bought this 6 months ago and am back searching again. The pink part of the face cracked only weeks after we got it. Ok, we can deal with that. Then when the watch got stuck in the net of a trampoline, the watch separated from the band- pins bent, holes that the pins go into were torn open, and the rest of the pink face came off. The strap was always way too big, so I'm back looking for a different model. It really is frustrating that Timex can't just make a scaled down model of the adult version. The kids ones just aren't durable and don't fit well."
3,Great watch - bad strap,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. I was a little unsure about it because of the several reviews saying the strap is not good. They are right. The strap design is stupid. It is a little big for my daughter but even if her wrist was larger, the strap would still be a problem. It is big and awkward. She almost never wears it. The watch itself is great and easy for her to use."
4,2nd grade daughter LOVES it!,"My daughter loves this FIRST watch for her. She can already tell analog time, however, this has more bells and whistles that kids this age loves. I would just change the strap to a regular rubber all around due to the velcro being a big sticky and rough on the delicate skin of young ones."
3,Timex Kids Watch,Well I bought it for a kid so I obviously wasn't going for a high end watch. I wanted a watch that was sturdy but not overly complicated. That is this watch. Just like everything else you get what you pay for. Timex quality on a kid level. should get the job done nicely
3,Interesting historical setting,"Interesting story in an authentic historical setting. I do not particularly care for the writing style, but the author's target audience was for a much younger audience. I think younger readers would enjoy the story, but may need to persevere until they get used to the dated writing style."
3,Slow Reading at Times,"I enjoyed the story, but found it slow reading at times. It seems that the writer belabored some points and had a habit of going into too much detail, which slowed the story down. It could have done with a good, contemporary editor to make the book flow more smoothly. If it had that, I would have rated it higher just based on the story. Having said all that, I did like the book."
3,Good for historical truth,"I enjoyed the book overall and felt it was entertaining in so far as it presented a view of the world as it might have been during this time following the structure of the historic past. But, it was a bit difficult to read with many stylistic and grammatical errors (just a pet peeve of mine that made it hard for me to read things smoothly). Also the story line was good but I felt it wrapped up sort of too well and quickly at the end. Still, the nature of the book seemed to be to steep the reader in the past and it did this well. I'd recommend it, I think, especially since it's a free Kindle book."
1,Poor audio quality,I am very disappointed in the audio quality of this CD -- without depth that I was looking forward to hearing... sounds like a cheap re-record!
5,WHEN WILL THIS GET IT's PRAISE??!!,A TOTAL GEM IN DEATH FUKKINNG METAL..THAT THE FAKE's have let rot in the basment of DEATH METAL HISTORY!!VITAL REMAINS early on was one of the best..and to this day with Benton at the helm.. they still KILL!!I have the VITAL REMAINS demo's as well!! ALL MADATROY!!''MALEVOLENT INVOCATION'' is perfect 90's DEATH METAL!!! the feeling and the energey this band give's off is so CONSUMING!!THIS IS JUST A TOTAL LONG LOST..DEATH METAL BLASTERPEICE!!!!! ONLY A POSER HAS NO CLUE THIS ALBUM EVEN EXSIST's!!!!!BUY/FIND IT NOW!!!!! ONLY FOR THE TRUE DEATH METAL FAN!!!!! THE EARLY 90's WAS THE BEST!!!!!
4,Two Short,For a band that packed all of its CD's to at least an hour and often times over 70 minutes it puzzles me why this CD is not even 60 minutes long. Sure all of it is great but it could have been one of the best live albums ever if they had put more songs into it. Still worth buying though as it shows Sublime's brillance as a live band.
2,Too slow,it was s . l . . o . . .w ......... it sounded like just noise in the background. if you're a true sublime fan get all the original cd tracks or just get the best of sublime.
2,dont push,this song is one of my favs but like any other sublime song its great sublime is the greatest band ever
5,Buy it,"This is an awesome cd. It's funny, and cool. I love the beginning of their Caress me Down song. Loui, Loui, Loui!! Anyway, buy it. It's da bomb!!!"
5,A sublime masterpiece,"For most of my life, i have been interested it badmusic until i came along sublime. sublime turned be on to the greatful dead(scarley begonias), the maytals(5446), peter tosh(steppen razor) and many more of the greats. I guarentee that anyone will like this album, it is some of sublimes best work, my favorite song on this album is ""all you need"" and ""djs"" (very different from 40 oz version). if you enjoy this, i recomend picking up ""40 oz to freedom"" and ""robbin the hood."""
5,lets go get stoned,"This was the CD that introduced me to sublime. It is my favorite album I own. Bradley sounds amazing on this. My favorites are Dont Push,Right Back,Lets Go Get Stoned,,Badfish,DJS,Work That We Do. I don't dislike any of the songs on here. Even though I normally listen to hip hop I think this easily beats any rap albums and I think its great that Sublime opened our eyes to the fact that there are white people in the Hood."
5,Awesome!,Lots of historical facts in this book but fiction made it fun too! Like a series with continuing characters. Would recommend!
4,Completely out there!!!,"I am a big fan of the ""Gears"". Having read all their books, I really was looking forward to a series. I have not been disappointed. The Visitant and this one fell right into place, although they could do without the modern day chapters. They are weak and not really that good. If the authors were just to skip them it would be great. I look forward to the next in the series."
3,The Summoning God,"This book was a local book club selection. The group rated it twos (mostly) and threes on a five point scale (1 =lowest; 5 = highest). Several people disliked the book so much they did not finish reading it and could not vote. The general consensus was, it was interesting in parts, but the author really needed a good editor."
4,Good evening read,"Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. One story leads to another and are well done. Some gay, some straight, some others but all seemed to work well together."
5,Mesmerizing cult movie !,"Since an insurance private eye investigates the murder of a wash up boxer he will be inmersed in a sordid underworld drama . An extendling Hemingway's taut tale.Fine acting , superb script and masterful direction .A must for those film noir lovers ."
4,Cast Pins Story,"Here's an example of an assortment of fine actors, and a dedicated and imaginative director, overcoming a sloppy script. Once the Hemingway material was used up the screenwriters emptied the sack of film-noir spare parts in an effort to keep this vehicle running: the fight game, the big heist, the prison cell buddies, the nightclub shootup, the chanteuse, the double-cross. But just watching the actors delivering their lines and director Robert Siodmak's lighting and camera work make it worthwhile. And you'll never see better black and white cinematography than here. Burt Lancaster is pretty awkward in his first film, but he gives a glimpse of the power and screen magnetism he later devleoped."
2,"Enjoyable, but Highly Repetitive","P. G. Wodehouse definitely can tell a funny story. The interaction between Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, always bring the smile to one's face. The problem is, once one has read a handful of the over thirty stories in this collection alone, everything else is simply repetition.Wodehouse's characters are two dimensional at best. These stories are definitely intended as very light reading, as a glance through the ""other books written by"" page in this volume suggests: There are 93 books by this author. 93! That doesn't include the omnibuses.Wodehouse's writing is complete fluff, yet charming fluff at that. I certainly couldn't read more than two or three of these short stories at a sitting. This is definitely library or used book material."
3,The book that changed my life,"The author of this book ended up as a journalism teacher at Northwestern University, the same time I ended up as a student at the overrated Medill institution. It was bad enough that the school was rehashing what we had studied in high school, but one of the required courses was ""Principles of Advertising."" It was required, I think, because otherwise no one would want to sit through a class taught by the pompous instructor. His name? Edward Carl Stephens, of course.So I changed majors, as did most of my journalism-major friends. If we had known there would be a market for Stephens' pulp, 40 years later, we would have grabbed some copies and stored them in an attic. In any case, he seems to have had a thing for writing books about submarines. At least he was good at something."
2,Bad Angles,"I never looked closely enough before buying, but notice in the supplied photo that the mounting screws are on about a 30 degree angle from vertical. Makes for a nice photo.Unfortunately, in the real world, the mounting holes are vertical ... which results in this horse actually rearing up at 30 degrees more than shown. What was a nice angle becomes an unusual feat and really, not all that attractive a pose. Too bad ... if the item had been properly dsesigned the horse would look fine and be a 5-star item. Anyone want mine?"
1,I Can Do It,"I purchased Quilting With Japanese Fabrics because I wanted to learn new techniques. I had attended a sashiko demo and decided this would be fun. Not only were the instructions understandable, the wall hanging went together easily. This is one of the best ""how to"" books I have purchased."
3,Quilting With Japanese Fabrics,"Although I enjoyed the wonderful photos and explanations of these quilts, what I was really looking for was instructions for creating my own."
3,OK for the average turtle lover,My son loves it. I think it's better than the hard plastic one he had last year. The zipper top opening is a little small. My other son has another version of this Thermos lunchbag but his has a small zipper pouch for money and a side pouch which I think they should have put one the Ninja Turtles on as well. A little too soon in the school year to see how well it will hold up.
2,"predictable, pedestrian mystery","This ""femjep"" mystery has all of the flaws of a beginning effort and few of the charms. The focus is really on the relationship between reporter Irene Kelly and detective Frank Harriman. Solving the mystery is almost incidental. And Irene doesn't do much investigating. Things happen to her and she overlooks obvious clues (e. g., the cable truck sitting outside her house for several days). She finds herself in far more physical danger than any one person would face in a lifetime, and yet the solution to the crime pops up when she isn't even looking for it. Burke has an annoying habit of trying to misdirect the reader -- which a mystery writer is supposed to do -- but in such a heavy-handed way that no reasonably intelligent reader is going to be fooled."
5,Miles ahead,"This one is miles ahead of ""Goodnight Irene,"" though I liked that one as well. It's just that the author has matured somewhat and so has the style. At any rate, ""Sweet Dreams"" is another in the ""Irene"" series and well worth the time and money you invest in it. Highly recommended--it's a fun read.Also recommended: Bark of the Dogwood by McCrae and The Da Vinci Code by Brown"
4,Value for Money,"I have been a sony digital camera user for over 5 yrs now. They keep improving on the product constantly. in the dsc T20 , i have no red eyes, the picture doesnt blur cause of the steady shot, and have an not to miss feature of 3x optical zoom. BUT what u r really payin $100 extra for is the cool sexy looks and slim design,also the vide range of colors they r available in.one draw back i see is the 2MP,3MP pictures dont seem as great as the previous cameras. and at 8MP u have great pictures which are very heavy to transfer or upload on the internet.sid"
4,"Not comprehensive, but wise","People looking for a comprehensive history and analysis of the publishing industry should look elsewhere; however, those intrigued by glimpses inside will enjoy BOOK BUSINESS. Epstein's strength and weakness here are one: this is a personal book. He ruminates on his experience as an editor and how it reflects the business as a whole. The anecdotes he collects are filtered through his impassioned eye, and his predictions are heavily based on what he has seen and known, not on the advice of other experts.The book's relatively loose structure is reminiscent of an intimate conversation. Is this bad? It depends on what you want. I found it refreshing and enjoyable, especially given the book's brevity. BOOK BUSINESS is a warm appraisal of a business close to the author's heart, and you won't find a more loving tribute to the art of book publishing."
2,Lots of digging required.,"Although Epstein gets his points across about the changing face of publishing, they are buried beneath personal tales which are interesting but distract from the pertinent information."
3,Not what I expected,"After just completing reading this book, my first thought is...no more? As someone who is extremely interested in the publishing industry, this has provided a small dose of knowledge. I do appreciate that even if small. Also, I highly respect a man with such a passion for books. I knew there had to be those knee-deep in this business that truly loved books.I expected this book to provide more insight into the future of publishing. That it focused a lot on history was somewhat disappointing.All in all though, it's a relief to see that the physical book is not in danger of becoming obselete and that the bookstore will live. Dedicated readers like myself must agree that the book is a precious thing."
2,"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","Jason Epstein has had a wonderful 50 years in the publishing industry. Good for him. I respect all that he's done. But upon reading this book, which was touted as ""the book they'll be talking about for decades,"" I am terribly disappointed. I bought the book hoping to find some insight into the publishing world of today. The first chapter or so, and a bit at the end of the book, gave me information and his opinions, which I value. The article ""Mistah Perkins, He Dead,"" written years ago, however, says much more succinctly what this 175-page book for $25 ever did. And believe me, I kept hoping."
3,not all that great,"i don't understand what is so great about this book. i didn't learn anything new from it, and it was only mildly entertaining. i suppose it's good casual reading, if you're on a plane or something. it's more or less well written, but not spectacular by any means. of course, i don't find wittgenstein that great, either. the book is funny at times, though.honestly, after reading all the great reviews, i expected much more of this book. i was very dissapointed. i felt like i was watching some quirky hour-long t.v. show about the wacky adventures of aspiring authors - something fantastic, something that would never happen in real life; but if you don't take it seriously, then it's fine. this is the only book by iris murdoch that i've read, and i really hope it isn't her best.so buy it if you want to read something mildly amusing, but if you feel like reading something that is truly worth the effort, look elsewhere."
1,What on earth did reviewers find humorous?,"This book is so pretentious, so show-offy, so geared to highly educated Oxbridge people, it clearly excludes the well-educated non academic reader.If you find drunkenness funny and the long descriptions of how drunkenness affects the body, I guess you will like this.I had to read it for my book club but hated every page -- no favorite characters or episodes.I hate to think the entire British public lives to get drunk but this and other literature and movies forces me to believe that no event in Britain, celebratory or shocking, takes place without a glass in hand."
5,perfect book for existentialist beer-lovers,"This is my favourite novel as strange as it is. Well, the fact is strange, not the novel. I read Murdoch's Unicorn and shrugged my shoulders. Read Black Prince and had a feeling that I had wasted my time. But Under the Net! - mmmm... A perfect book for young existentialist beer-lovers, who love dusty bookshops, who keep late hours and hate regular jobs. And, please, don't blaspheme this book by analysing it too much (like some sophisticated reviewers here tend to do). Enjoy the ride and have some beers with good friends instead. If you like deconstructing things to symbolic bits and pieces, read Camus instead."
3,"lovely writing, no plot","I loved the writing and thought this was going to be a great comfort book. I started reading it though and it was a bit of a push. No real plotline to keep you going, nothing really happens. Wish it could have had that writing with some shaping of some sort."
1,review,I uess this works on RC cards. I aksed for TS-27 Matt White ( Flat White) I get a answer to this. heck NO WRONG. these people should read the details. I did not ask for RC paint. if I was I will beasking for it. Not so smart in customer service I seeI cannot use this paint. Its the wrong paint for the wrong job.plastic kits do not use this paint. what is the seller thinking. Dose not know there own product?
4,who is DTL???????????,"i heard about this cat through DJ friends and myspace, but never heard his music until this EP. .... DAMN! this cat is the bomb - this cd is full of hard pounding bass and grime like beats but with his vvocals that remind me of frank sinatra or something... something really brand new.. i know, that in a few years, this dude is going to blow up big. i want more!!!!"
2,Deeply sick,"This is a deeply sick film. The heroine, played by Maggie Smith, is older, has been sexually abused throughout her life, and is now the author of trashy books. On a train an explosion rips through her compartment, miraculously saving some and killing others. (Maggie's severe facial wounds heal apparently within days, leaving no scars.) Three survivors, including a little girl, come to live in the Italian villa owned by the heroine. Then the girl's uncle comes to take away the psychologically damaged waif to America. The story then grows intensely dark and unappealing, as the heroine drowns herself in alcohol and the American turns out to be an utterly repulsive and insensitive jerk. What a waste of Maggie Smith's great talent. HBO was the perfect place for this film. IFC should soon run it."
1,Dark & Loathsome!,"This movie is a CHEAP knock-off of Enchanted April. Enchanted April is an uplifting, feel-good movie, one of our favorites. ""My House.."" has its moments, but for the most part has some VERY DARK undercurrents and images that cast a pall over the entire movie. It leaves you feeling depressed and icky! It is like the EVIL TWIN to Enchanted April which I highly recommend to men as well as Chicks! Guys will love Enchanted April. Shame on My House in Umbria for such a sordid copy catting of Enchanted April."
4,One of my favorites,Love the beautiful scenery in this movie. Always have and if Maggie Smith is in it....it's got to be good.
4,Cheers Maggie,"This is a classic Maggie Smith, with a very brave protrayal of her charachter. The plot moves about, but you slowly begin to realize that her character is narating to you and bringing the other characters to life.Not that you would need help. If you are a Maggie Smith fan... and it's why I bought the movie.... you will not be disapointed. It's one of her best if you wan't a taste of Maggie."
1,'Enchanted April' debased,"I couldn't agree more with a previous assessment of this film as a poor imitation of 'Enchanted April'. A small example: Does it not tell you something that the same actor (Anna Longhi) reprised her 'Enchanted April' role in 'Umbria'? Pity 'My House in Umbria' didn't likewise import that film's charm, wit and sincerity."
5,Maggie Smith at her best -,"This is a beautiful movie; both scenic and poignant. Maggie Smith at her very best. The story, the caste, the location - everything is perfect. It is kind of like a little trip to Italy."
4,My House in Umbria,"Curious and wonderful discoveries are made when you open your heart, and this case, house, to strangers that have been thrown together by a terrorist bomb on a train. A delight to watch as their personalities and complexities draw them all together. ""Heartwarming"" is an overly used word, but in this case it is difficult to find a more descriptive one!"
3,Beautifully shot but something is not quite right,I haven't read all the reviews so am I the only person to think that Maggie Smith was way to old to play this part? I am a great fan of hers but for me it just didn't work. Even the photo on the DVD cover suggests the woman is in her 40's and that is how I saw her. And why make Timonthy Spall (another favourite) Irish with an accent he just couldn't manage. The whole thing seemed off centre to me.
4,Better than average movie,"Four people survive a bomb exploding in a passenger car while traveling on a train in Italy. An English novelist Emily (Maggie Smith) who lives in Italy invites the three survivors to stay at her home in the country to recuperate. One of them is an American girl around ten years old. Her uncle comes to pick her up to take her back to America.I found this a charming movie and Maggie Smith a delight to watch. I loved the flowing outfits that she wore and couldn't help but think I would like her fashion style as an old woman. Emily is a bit of a lush, but kind and likable. Her character had a rough life when she was young yet she found a way to create her own life that is quite pleasant. The scenery is beautiful (according to credits, England and Italy). Maggie's acting makes this simple story interesting. I think it's worth watching. I'm sure women over 40 will especially like it."
4,My House in Umbria,"A truly wonderful movie about making the best of what Life deals you. The scenery is gorgeous and gives one an idea of what life in Italy is about-if you could afford living there.Beautiful things come about for strangers-all on a different Path of Life-until they all meet. Don't miss this truly amazing story.If you like this movie you will love ""Enchanted April""."
4,Good Movie - Interesting Cast,"Delightful and yet sometimes heart wrenching story. Beautiful oasis in Italy reminded me of ""Enchanted April"" and ""A Room with a View"" other great British based Italy movies."
5,My House In Umbria,"I love this movie! Saw it with at a friends home, and wanted to own a copy. It is a very special story."
3,Enjoyable,"How to overcome tragedy with your humanity in tact should be the message this film offers, if a message was intended, that is, but there are other angles not so rich in intent that bothered me about the main characters. Still, I liked the film"
2,not teacher friendly,I find that the Kindle is not very teacher friendly as The Readers Theater can not be printed out to use with the class. I deleted all my clippings and now still can not add to print the readers theater scripts for use in classes Permission from the Publisher has been used...And I didn't copy but maybe three full scripts....hope this can be fixed ...I love my Kindle and have been very fortunate to be one of the first to have one!
2,"trains, boats, and walking!","I purchased this book some time ago, with great anticipation, yet was somewhat disappointed. Oddly, the whole tale is outlined in the excerpt printed on the back cover! Johnny Reb was pretty much on his own, while the Northern troops had the advantages of the railways, and other means of transportation at their disposal. That is pretty much it! Granted, the late Fr. Holberton offers many ""eye-witness"" accounts of the trials and travails of the wanderings of both Federal and Confederate soldiers, yet even these become repetitive in their sameness.On a more structural note, the format offers relatively big print, and only 150 pages of readable text."
5,Just what you need!,"OK, I recommend all 3 trimester workouts. I was able to get a workout that got my heart pumping, but it was never too much, these DVDs are really well done to give you a safe prenatal workout. I'm 4.5 months postpartum now, and am back to my pre-pregnancy weight! I know that doing the prenatal workouts kept me from gaining too much weight, and made it easier to get back into working out regularly (with her Boot Camp!) since I didn't take a 9 month workout break. I felt energetic, not exhausted, after these workouts. Good to see real pregnant women on these videos, too."
3,It's an OK workout,"I bought this DVD based on all of the great reviews. But I have to say that I wasn't really that impressed. I thought that Lindsay's cuing for the moves was way too late, so I found myself trying to catch up and missing some of the reps. I also thought that she was moving around way too quickly for me, and I'm a regular exerciser. I have a decent sized belly at 18 weeks pregnant right now! The music was really repetitious and I got tired of hearing the same thing over and over again. I just wasn't as thrilled with this workout as I have been with other DVDs, such as Tracey Mallet Fit for Pregnancy, Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean or Prenatal fix with Erin O'Brien. It did get my heart rate up but it was more of a frenzied, hurry-up type of state that I was in, and that may be why I was panting!"
2,not impressed,"I was hoping this would be a challenging pregnancy workout since many i have seen are lame...pre pregnancy i had been doing the p90x program for over a year and maybe the intensity of those workouts had my expectations of Lindsay Brins to high. She is annoying and the workout is just so so. i broke a sweat only because i intesified the cardio sections. with the counsel of my doctor, i just started back with the p90x (with several modified moves, of course). i like to sweat and feel like i have worked out and this video did not do that for me. if you are not used to really intense workouts, i suppose this would be good for you. for reference, i started this at 14 weeks...17 now and still enjoying my p90x."
3,Good but not great,"This is a pretty good and challenging video. She uses weights (2 sets) and demonstrates a variety of strength training exercises, with 2 back-up pregos using lighter weights for demonstration. Though they are good moves, the video doesn't always cut to a correlating shot of ""how to do it"" immediately. Sort of odd, and so 1/2 way through your reps you realize you've been doing it wrong--not every move though.Also, there are brief intervals of cardio thrown in which I found to be somewhat lackluster. A lot of marching in place and grapevine type moves.My last complaint (which could totally just be my own reaction, or my prego state of mind) but I find Lindsay Brin a little annoying. She is ultra perky and keeps talking about your ""bun"" which I found annoying. In order to buy a workout DVD and do it repeatedly, you really have to like the person teaching it, and unfortunately this instructor grated my nerves."
5,Great way to start or continue your exercise,This is a great video! The entire series is very helpful. You can do the workout or just play the yoga section. The instructor does an amazing job of telling what to focus on and how to set yourselfin the correct position. She also give alternate positions for more advanced or beginners. Highly recommended for all moms-to-be!
4,One of the Better Pregnancy Videos,"Good arms/shoulders/back workout. Legs and cardio sections are as challenging as I hoped they would be. Lindsay Brin is a little more smiley and perky than I prefer, but it isn't distracting. The yoga video is good, but very short. Overall, one of the better pregnancy workout videos."
2,"OK, but not great",I did this exercise video once and really wasnt too impressed. I got bored with the way it was laid out and had a hard time with how the instructor told you what was coming next. Not very impressed.
5,Great Prego Video,"This video is pretty awesome. I think you do just enough so that you don't feel too tired and you also don't feel as if you haven't done anything. I really like the yoga part. It stretches you out and you feel relaxed afterward, ready for a shower and bed. :)"
2,Where is quality control?,"The first set arrived with the handle attached to the one cup measuring cup crooked. When you held the handle the cup was tilted and not level. The set was returned as ""defective"" and a replacement ordered.The replacement set had the handle on the one cup attached also at an angle.The measuring cups have the handles spot welded to the bowls and are therefore not ""one piece"" as advertised.For the price, this might be ""good enough"" but for me it lacked quality control and was not acceptable."
2,Very low finishing quality,"When I open it, I start to feel disappointed. Some unknown black oil remains on two cups and all handles. I guess the black oil is used for stainless polishing. It is ok to wipe clean the black oil. Then, I found welding brown-flat spots inside all cups surface. It doesn't look nice but still acceptable. Finally, I found the 1-cup edge is uneven with poor finishing. Maybe it is just an defective item. However, till I see the words, ""made in China"", with the unknown black oil in my hand, I feel more disappointed."
3,Just average,"Cups are OK but handles are flimsy. Storing them nested in a drawer works fine, but hanging them nested on a hook for easy access is impossible (without using a ring) because the holes do not match up as the handles are of different lengths. This is probably typical of most, if not all, stainless sets and may not be an issue for most users."
2,"Okay, but should be better for the price",Like many other reviewers found the handles to be nothing but junk. First time using the one cup measure the handle bent over just from the weight from the flour I was measuring. For the price there are better options out there.
3,Flimsy Handles,"You can't tell from the photo on the box, but the handles on the measuring cups are very thin, and bend easier than they should."
2,pretty crappy,"They came with this greasy coating, which is no big deal just washed it off... but the handles are just crappy. The one cup handle bends when carrying one cup of sugar?! I doubt they will last long. The spoons are fine though."
5,More than I expected.,More than I expected. For the price I thought I would be getting a basic thin cheap product. These are great! Heavy metal and very well made. They look like little pots. Have them nicely displayed for everyone to see.
1,Horrible!,"I didn't even bother to sent it back. I just tossed it in the trash. When I tried to use the cup the handle bent. Then I noticed that the metal looked strange, almost like pewter. I wouldn't risk using this ""made in China"" set. Who knows what it's really made of!"
2,"Not very good, I'm afraid!","Not the original line up, and Boy does it show! I bought this album for the track ""(Kiss me once..)It's been a long, long time"" and even this song has been spoilt. Most of the songs sound ""false"" - almost as though someone is doing a poor Karaoke version of them. Sorry boys, but PLEASE don't kid yourselves. The Ink Spots? ... I think not!"
4,"I like the hip-hop Missy, not so much R&B...","Missy Elliott has always been one of the most creative artists in the industry, which she succeeds. All of her albums have jaw-dropping beats and really talented featured artists. On this album, she comes with the same formula, tracks such as ""We Run This"" and ""On & On"" will have you dancing for an eternity. This is the Missy that everyone loves, so why does she put slow ballads on here? Honestly, they are not too bad, ""Teary Eyed"" is one of the best R&B records Missy has ever done, but the album can do without them all. I think she should take off songs like ""4 My Man"" with Fantasia and put on another club banger like ""Lose Control"" with Ciara. Overall though, one of the best hip-hop albums this year."
4,OFF THE HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK,"First and foremost, I would like to say that this album is off the hook. Missy does it again with her off the hook club beats and smooth r&b Ballots. The only reason why I gave this album a 4-5 star rating is because it doesn't live up to her 2nd lp. Don't get me wrong, I feel that this is one of the best records of the year but it is not better than Miss E. So Addictive!!!"
4,one of the few real artists in hip hop for sure.,"Ok lets face it , most hip hop artists can't sing and few can write music. They are not on the level of real musicians and if you realize that you can place them at the lower end of the musical scale , (you have to able to play a instrument to be higher on the scale)but this gal has real talent and is getting more mature. which puts her way above the sampling crowd in every way.that's why she's getting better and the people who are slaves to one beat sampling can't understand complex music at all. hence the bad reviews. the autotune slop is even lowering things more into cookie cutter sameness.death to the autotune and long live those with talent like missy."
2,not her best...,"I can't wait to see Missy's third video from this album ""We Run This"" !!!I was so dissapointed with Teary Eyed/Meltdown Medley, but Lose Control/On & On was cool!Go Missy!! Maybe your 7th album will be better. Keep workin'with The Neptunes girl."
2,yuck !!! maybe it will grow on me,"i have each one of missy's albums. i looove this woman and her incredible talent, but this is the worst of her collection. maybe i just need to listen to it several more times and hope that it will grow on me. i love the song ""lose control"" and ""we work this"", but i just can't seem to feel the groove of this album. i'm looking forward to her next album. sorry missy, but i still love ya!! boo on this album though!!"
1,Get out the kitchen,"I've been a misdemeanor fan since I can remember. In my opinion, Da real world was her hottest joint and essentially began her road to fame. I'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this effort. Without Tim, there would be no missy (that works both ways without missy, there would be no tim). If she wanted to do some old school stuff, I'm sure she could have got tim to do some retro beats, I mean did anyone here what Mr. Shawn Carter said on FADE TO BLACK about Mr. Mose?! I think missy needs to get back in the kitchen and work on a new cook book?!"
2,Where'd the old missy go?,"I love missy but this CD isn't that good. When i first bought the CD i had already heard a few tracks and really liked those. But sadly those were the only good ones. These are the songs I recommend u download from this cd:JoyPartytimeLose ControlOn & OnWe Run ThisMommyBadmanThese are the really great dance songs. The others are slow and i think, horrible! Where is Timbaland to come save the day!? Missy needs to stop making songs w/ Fantasia and make more songs w/ Ciara bc everytime she does it's amazing! The rapping is good. On second thought-there is barely any rapping. Most of the CD is R&B;! this CD is nothing like any other missy CD. But the songs I listed above are good and u should download those. But if u do buy the cd for some strange reason don't except to blast the speakers bc there isn't anything to really blast."
2,Missy Elliott what were you thinking?,"Missy Elliott is cool but this album is the worst. The only song that I like is ""Lose Control"" but the other ones are way boring. I wouldn't buy her CD."
1,The Cookbook Sizzles To A Fizzle,"The Cookbook is supposed to a smorgasbord of goodies, but when I listened to it, it gave me nothing but indigestion. To me, this is the sloppiest of all albums. No cohesion, no general theme, no substance. Overall, album fizzles! Grade: F!"
1,Worst album ever,"This album is a total dissapointment to say the least. I tried to listen to this lp over and over again just to see if maybe it's one of those albums that have to grow on you. Everytime it has the same effect it did when i first heard it, which is ""horrible"". This is what happens when she doesn't have Timabaland. That's why this is her worst album ever!"
1,At least she LOOKS better .....,"I take my hat off to Missy Elliot, who lost ??? pounds recently. She looks SO MUCH BETTER than she used to. For that reason alone I give her respect. Now I can actually stomach a video. .....On mute anyway. Sadly her music is that same wackiness she's always put out. I remember her debut ""I can't stand the rain"" I hated it. I hated everything from her since. WAIT-A-MINUTE .... I liked that song she did with Tweet & Genuwine ... but thats a diamond in the rough. I may hate her as an artist, but I respect her as a producer/ song writer for others. Ever since 702's {Steelo} Ah well, big props 2 Missy on her weight!!!"
2,oompa loompas,"The beginning to the track 'Lose Control"" sounds like an oompa loompa song out of Charlie and the Choclate Factory. After that it's a pretty good song, until they fall back into the oompa loompa pattern."
1,About as talented as a blind sharp shooter,Self indulgent mess of various horrible sounds and stupid rhymes. I bought this disc and immediately went to the doctor for a shot. I did not want to be infected by its disease. I still don't know what this rash is...
5,It's about time!!!,"Now this is the true follow-up to Grammy Award winning ""Under Construction"". I don't know what was wrong with Missy on ""This Is Not A Test"" but she brought her A-game on this here. For one thing, she got rid of alot of unneccesary skits on here; there are only like three skits which is hella good for a rap album. Even though Timbaland is missed on this cd, the many different producers on this gives the album a good feel to it. It doesn't get repetiticve quickly. ""Mommy"" and ""On & On"" are the hottest tracks. Slick Rick brought his sh*t to this album too. This is one of Missy's better albums. This should go at least 3x platinum."
1,COPY-PROTECTED DISK WILL NOT PLAY IN COMPUTER,"This disk has some kind of cockamamie copy-protection scheme that prevents it from playing in any computer I've tried it in. If you want to load the songs in your IPod, forget it. When you insert it, it directs you to a Missy Elliott website which tries to install an ActiveX control on your machine, probably spyware. Even if you allow this, the disk won't play. None of this is disclosed on the package. It will play on a regular CD player. I listened to it once, then threw it in the trash. Please do not give money to music bandits who manufacture this kind of deceptive and flawed merchandise."
3,Too many cooks in the kitchen,"Though Timbaland produces the first two songs, he leaves Missy to get a host of producers for creating magic. Sometimes it works (""Teary Eyed"") but most times it doesn't (""On & On""). She also relies too much on the old school (as on her last two albums) and she really needs to give it up. And Rich Harrison needs to step his game up because ""Can't Stop"" sounds like his past hits, ""1 Thing"", ""Get Right"" and ""Crazy in Love"". This album hasn't sold too well, either. Maybe Missy should pull Timbaland away from bodybuilding so they can do more work together."
5,Off the Chain,"I actually thought this album wuz kinda gone be dissappointing. Im happy 2 say that Missy survived w/o Timbo the king. Im glad she brought a mix of tracks rather than that ol skool vibe she insisted on bringin back. Instead she flexes her versitality vocally as an mc and a singer. I usually dont vibe w/ missy's singin but on tracks like ""meltdown""&""Teary Eyed"" she getz my vote. Id say theres only maybe 2 bad songs which is a big improvement 4rm ""This Is Not a Test""...I say cop it!"
2,average&going through the Motions,"Missy is always good for a energy type of jam,but her past few albums on a whole have been missing that key ingrediant that made her so interesting throughout the late 90's.she still drops a couple of cool tracks,but there is alot of filler&there isn't that One knock out jont.pretty average&Missy doesn't sound as driven as she was in the past.still She keeps you interested."
4,Quite Missy,"This album is not as outrageous as previus albums, but every bit as good. Definately one for the collector and the everyday fan, not owning this album is no misdemeanor, but a felony."
4,This recipe is Near Perfection,"This is the first time in a long time that I've had an album that I didn't have to keep pushing the skip button on. I can just keep this album playing almost the entire way through, for the exception of 1 song that I don't particularly care for. I love all the guest appearances, Slick Rick, Mar J Blige, Tweet, Fantasia, Vybez Cartel,and the list goes on and also love the fun Missy has with throwing in different dialects into her rap form. This is just a great album and I foresee Missy having another fabulous year from this album."
4,"Pretty Good, but not to die for.....","Most of cds are pretty good with addictive beats, but lately it hasnt been anything to come back to. Da Real world, and Supa Dupa Fly, and So addictive are the best."
4,A Musical Recipe,"Missy outdoes herself on her 6th album aptly titled, The Cookbook. The album starts off unusually in the form of an untitled interlude that goes into the first banger, Joy featuring Mike Jones. Missy keeps this album afloat with hot beats and hot producers. This time around she ditches Timbaland (who only did a few tracks) in favor of producers such as Rich Harrison (Crazy In Love), Nisan Stewart (Tweet), and The Neptunes, who did the funky old school track, On & On, one of the album's many highlights. The sexy and sassy retro, Meltdown works as well as somewhat of a sequel to Missy's Pussycat which appeared on her 2002 Under Construction album. I'm really happy with this album and this is a much needed improvement of over Missy's last 3 albums. I can definitely say this a thorougly enjoyable album fresh with intoxicating beats, wise production, and Missy's wicked flow. Highly recommended****"
1,Please Try Again,"How many popular songs can you sample in one album and still be considered original?? ""Lose control"" is basically Afrika Bambaata's ""Planet Rock"" instrumental with Missey hollering dance moves like a 69Boyz song. ""We run this"" is Sugar Hill's ""Apache"" just cut up and rehashed with Missey shouting ""we run this"". There are countless others that I do not feel like typing out. If missey runs ""this"" I don't want to have anything to do with it. This album lacks originality and Missey needs to get her own beats and quit Jockin the old schoolers. She has taken the hip hop community one step backwards. I need one favor from Missey....O R I G I N A L I T Y."
1,missy's starting to look more masculine these days,if you're a missy fan and gots to have her cd then this is for you I cannot relate to this kind of rap the beats are decent and okay but since I'm not into missy she needs to come out the closet and become the bulldagger she really is every damn video she uses other models to plast her head on this shows low self estemm issues.
3,"Decent price, difficult to fill.",I like the look of the feeder. Haven't had any squirrels try it out yet so I can not attest to it's strength. Maybe it is just me but I seemed to spill a ton of seed trying to fill this feeder. It would be nice if the compartments came out and could be individually filled or cleaned.
2,Just OK,"Not at all squirrel proof. Actually, it took the squirrels about 20 minutes to figure out how to hang off of it and poke their hateful mouths into the holes and eat the seed. The birds are still trying to figure out where to land. It's hard to fill and isn't really the best for birdseed with nuts and fruit pieces in it."
3,bird feeder,this is about the best shape except that plastic tends to break down and the cost of the replacement of the plastic parts is almost cost of the entire feeder
4,Spoiler Alert,"If you read the BACK COVER of the book, there is a spoiler that the author didn't spill the beans on until the last twenty pages. Shame on whomever wrote the back cover copy. Also, they should have checked the dates involved. DECADES ago, Minoru Kurita joined the Nova Cats, not centuries. That should have been caught by some editor.All that said however, this was a really good book. I have no problems recommending it to others."
2,Not worth it,"This book hits bottom barrel. The writing style is totally unreadable - its excessive in descrition and not in a good way. Not only that, but twice in the book the author switched from 3rd person to 1st person!I definatly would not recommend the book. Though it sounded pretty excited and definatly seemed to have an interested character to follow in the end you'll be dissapointed."
1,Disappointing would be an understatement,"I never write reviews, but this new book by Bills was so frightfully depressing for an old battletech fan that I had to write something. I've followed battletech books since I was a kid, and have basically bought and read every battletech novel since the Sword and the Dagger.Heretic's Faith was convoluted, lacking direction, and left one very unsatisfied with the rather unclimatic end. While there was the nice touch of Minoru Kurita, I think Bills over-reached in this attempt, which resulted in a pretty un-battletech-like book. No good combat sequences, glimpses but no decent overview of the political and strategic objectives and success of the involved powers, and a disappearance from the clean-cut technological warfare that raises battletech above the other sci-fi and fantasy books out there.All of Bills' published battletech work prior to this has been pretty good and hopefully we can return to that in his next novel."
2,The slow decay of a once great franchise continues.,"At one time I looked forward to the release of a new Battletech novel. The writing was, for the most part, enjoyable and the stories were, again for the most part, exciting.Then came Mechwarrior Dark Age.I really tried, tried hard to enjoy these books. But each one got progressively worse. The plots, such as they were, became more banal and dull.Heretic's Faith tries very hard to break the pattern. But, it fails on almost every attempt. By the midpoint of the book, you'll have figured out the ending. By the ending you'll be wishing that you ordered something else. Surrounded by fanboiz and sycophants the current authors fail to realise one important fact:The magic is gone, and they have no idea how to get it back.Go buy some of the Original Battletech novels."
4,It ain't called Brand Nu It's called staying True,"One love to Puba,Sadat X,Jamar and Alamo. You brothers have truly brought it back to where it should be. Your lyrics and songs on this album have invoked thoughts ranging from my childhood to my adult life. I just wish you brothers would have blessed us sooner but good things are worth waiting for!!! Hip-Hop has truly missed Brand Nubian as the group that had sparked a movement with One for All then disbanded. stay together because you have so much to say and keep putting it down in a positive way."
4,A very good album.,"I missed my boys. I am a true Brand Nubian fan! A favorite on this album is ""Sincerely"". I like the new direction of self- / black pride and respect for women."
3,It's okay,"I purchased it with the thought of having something with the original crew. It was okay, but I wouldn't rave..."
5,FABULOUS!!!1,"All I have to say is this album is EXACTLY what I expected it to be! Definite Food for the Soul! I get sooo much energy from it. It's so good to hear these guys together again. This CD is a beautiful reflection of the Intelligent Black men that today's ""pop rap"" is sorely missing."
2,Not Enough,I was hoping for a dye product.What I got was paint in a baby food size jar..I think the product is way to expensive..
2,"Good writing, bad detective","I bought this book because of all the great reviews. But I have to say I was really disappointed with this book. The overall story and character development is good but December Vaughn is an idiot! It was really painful to read this book and how the main character didn't pick up on any of the clues! I would pass on this book. The good writing doesn't makeup for the idiot detective work. If you want a good mystery book read Passion, Betrayal and Killer Highlights by Kyra Davis."
2,Not great for use in art,"I do acrylic paintings. I had been using blue painters tape to attach paper or canvas paper to a board. The blue color was interfering with my ability to manage the colors of the artwork. The adhesive on this tape is really strong. When peeling the tape off, it often takes part of the paper with it. Probably great for other purposes though."
2,Save your money...,"And buy white masking tape, it's essentially the same thing, and it won't cost 10 bucks! Kinda translucent, really thin."
5,Surprisingly good movie,"This is one of Andy Lau's best movies, and Andy should've won an award for it. Andy's performances are often hit-and-miss, but I am surprised at how good he is in this film. The supporting cast are good too, especially the younger version of Andy.The movie's beautifully shot, and is very effective at evoking the audience's emotions. I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but the treatment of the story is very different from Hollywood films. I wonder why Hollywood chooses not to use such an effective tool.Buy it, see it, with friends, family, movie going doesn't get better than this."
4,Elizabethan Melodrama,"i liked the novel for its historical connection to 16th century English history and its portrayal of martyrdom in that period. On the negative side, the novel is somewhat wordy by today's standards and at times seems overly melodramatic."
1,Apalling quality,I was most surprised to receive what is obviously a pirated copy of this film. The cover is a cheap print out which does not even fit properly in the box. The quality of the movie is absolutely appaling - like some cheap 80's pirate video. Do not buy this film!!!
1,Wrong version,The only REAL version of this stunning film is the version distributed by Celestial Pictures themselves in their Shaw Brothers Collection.Don't buy anything else than that.
1,"Defective, may be Pirated and misleading Title","First of all the DVD inside is not the famous ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"". It is ""Return to the 36th Chamber"", sequel to the original movie.The Video quality is so poor that I think it is a pirated copy.I cannot believe Amazon can sell such item."
1,Appalling,"I waited to receive this copy from the US,and when I checked it out it was very bad quality.Thick of the worst video you have,and I think you can understand.I certainly won't be buying anything off this studio again.I do recommend dvds from Red Sun,Hong Kong Legends and Vengeance Video are ok.The film is a masterpiece of classic kung fu,but the quality is dire.I hope Red Sun release it."
4,a lost gem,"After many years waiting for this to be re-released in the U.S. I gave up and bought an Import copy. This is a very good album and unfortunately not too many people have ever heard it. It was released right before their breakthrough U.S. release ""Labour of Love"". I guess you can say that it was released at an awkward time. Three of the best songs on this album ""I Won't Close My Eyes"",""Dubmobile"" and ""So Here I Am"" were released on a Greatest Hits Collection entitled ""80-85"". It was a compilation of their songs from the first four albums. The rest of these songs are good as well. I actually prefer their 80's material because it was more straitforward reggae. They got more commercial as the 90's rolled around. Which I'm not saying is bad. There's nothing like some English boys playing some reggae. It's good to hear this again after being in hiding for so long."
2,Italy-Folk Songs from Naples,"The tenors in this recording are very good. I am personally disappointed in this CD which is not what I was looking for: a collection of vocal and instrumental with accordians and mandolins, with lively music that inspires dancing. This was all vocal."
3,This CD is good because it's Sublime groovin live.,"This CD is good because you get to hear the rawness of their playing live. But I'll say one thing, having seen Sublime play twice live in very intimate settings before Bradley tragically passed, there is no CD or recording out there that can capture the true passion and power that Brad brought to the table with his guitar playing and his voice. That is the tragedy that we as fans have to live with."
4,Easy to use in my Brother Printer!,"These brochures make it very easy for me to create new brochures on the fly when I need to. They work well in my Brother Inkjet and love the pre-scoring that mades folding easy. The matte white is clean and crispt and holds the ink well. Also like that weight - not too thin, not too thick."
2,Clowns went to thinner paper. LOW QUALITY,The Avery clowns have switched to a thinner lower quality paper. You might as well us 24 LB paper. This is crapola.
5,"Grasshopper, when will your double-secret probation end???","Yes Paul. Like many of your co-workers, I too await my free copy. And, as I had the most mentions, according to Pete R., I deserve it."
1,The editors need more help than the students,"This book's purpose is to be a self-help resource for students who want to prepare for the SAT Math Level 2 Subject Test; however, it looks like the people who really need the self-help are the writers and editors. The book is wrought with errors both in the answers to practice tests, the diagnostic test, and even the explanations the book gives. If I hadn't already written in the book to show work, it would be on its way back to the store."
2,McGraw-Hill's SAT II - Math Level II,"The book has many typographical errors that should have been caught before the book was printed. For example, just in the diagnostic test I found three errors. This makes the book limited value for students since it confuses many of them. It also doesn't allow you to properly judge how well a student is doing."
2,better than nothing,so it has a ****load of errors. at least it's better than nothing. and anyone who's smart enough to take the level 2 test should be smart enough to find the errors.
2,A voyage into mediocrity,"Well Hell has frozen over. I finally heard a Paul Oakenfold mix cd that I didn't like. ""Voyage into Trance"" is bloody boring. This is why trance doesn't get much respect. The songs sounds too much alike. Of course anything trance on the Hypnotic Label is pretty dull. There are none of the angelic voices that are found on his other cds. Even ""Ibiza"" is better than this cd as flawed it might be. ""Voyage into Trance"" has nothing on ""Tranceport"" or ""Another World"". I would expect this mediocre ... from some wannabe dj who wants to become the next Paul Oakenfold but not from Oakey himself."
5,Great Mix,"I've listened to every Oakenfold album, and this is one of his finest. I was rather dissapointed with ""Another World,"" and thought Oakey was a sellout. This mix is much darker, but has some amazing moments. It flows great, and keeps the mood. ""Another World"" had some okay tracks, but it isn't consistant. Anyone can put a few good songs together, but it takes some skill to make the mix flow well from start to finish. This is a well crafted mix, and you won't find any 'pop' trance songs, just tracks that seamlessly fold together. If you're expecting somthing like ""another world"", you may want to pass. Any serious trance lover should pick this up."
4,Best of His First,"I used to be an Oakenfold fan when he was coming out with albums like this one, ""Transport"" and ""Perfecto Presents Another World"" After ""Perfecto Presents Another World"" his music started to go down hill. So, in a sum up, yes this album is worth it, but if you get any newer albums by this artist, I wouldn't recommend it. Just stick to the classics."
3,Old School Oakie,"Should give it less, but if I would have bought this CD back when it was really recorded I probably would have given it 4. I agree with the others in noting that this CD is definitely from a different time period. It's pretty obvious and I'm kind of dissapointed that at the time when I shelled out the dough for this, I was actually under the impression that it was new. Will the Oakenfold resident of Cream ever resurface? Or will the over marketed old timer continue to float on the surface. Only time will tell. Still an Oakie fan though..."
2,not the paul oakenfold we know and love,this album [disappoints]. im a fan of oakenfold but this is some wierd tibet sounding stuff. nothing like what oakenfold is known for now. buy it only if you want to complete your oakenfold collection.
2,Very disappointing,"I saw the title, and I thought, ""Well, it's released off Hypnotic Records and they rarely use modern songs."" I chanced it, and it was okay, but nothing too impressive. As far as the mixing goes, the songs are just combined, that's it. Most of the songs are so repetive and unoriginal that the overall sound of the disk is something that would either put you to sleep or throw the CD away. Man With No Name is good, but other than that the songs are too long and repetitive. I -was- an Oakenfold fan but this has shattered my faith in him as a DJ. If you like goa trance that is not-so-new, then buy this. If you're expecting a Tranceport or Essential Mix, avoid it at all costs."
1,almost purchased this until i read .....,"Oakenfold called a recent compilation titled Voyage Into Trance, which is credited to him, an ""illegal bootleg,"" saying that eight years ago he mixed some tracks on the British label Dragonfly for a friend who owned it. Now, he claims, ""they've changed the cover, they've put me all over it, and it looks like it's an album from me. I have nothing to do with it. The original title was Dragonfly: Voyage Into Trance."" Oakenfold said his lawyers are working on preventing further copies of the collection, which is released in America by Hypnotic Recordings, from reaching stores."
4,It's a love/hate relationship with Oakenfold I guess!,"I realy enjoyed reading the various reviews of this album. I've had it a while, and figured I'll throw my $.02 in. Yes, this is not the Oakey we currently know, this is more techno sounding. I actually like some of the harder tracks on here, which was a surprise for me when I first played it. This is no Tranceport, that's for sure. I've only been into the scene for a few years, so I like being able to hear ""what he was like back then.""That said, I find it odd for people to put Oakey down for this album, a rerelease, when they admit in the next sentence they like his current work. It would be more helpful to just explain how/why it is different so people can rationalize a possible purchase. If you like Oakey and want to hear a different, edgier sound, check this out. But if you are expecting a smooth mix of trance and progressive trance, better buy some of his more recent work."
2,Voyage into ???,"I found the depth of this album very hard to grasp as it lacked in uplifting sounds. Instead, all I could really think of when listening was how it sounded to low and the path the music was taking was very unsure. Instead of uplifting trance this album is dark and mellow. Not to my taste."
3,Very GOA,Oakenfold takes us on a quite different journey than he did with Another World and Tranceport. If you like the goa sounds of Terra-Firma and Astral Projection you will love this cd. I wouldnt classify this as trance though. This album isnt nearly as amazing as Another World but still its decent. Wicked Warp is a great song.
2,Not Good,"Oakenfold has always thrived on house and deep trance and everything in between. The appropriate title of this album should be ""Voyage Into Goa"" because that's precisely what this cd is. I don't know why he released this cd. He never plays goa live, and after listening to this cd you will find out why he doesn't.The only saving graces this cd has are that ""Trancemission"", ""Sly-ed"", and ""Hallucinogen"". These tunes are ok on their own, but since they are after all Goa tracks, they all sound pretty much the same."
3,Not too impressed,"This cookbook stand has worked ok for me. It looks nice, and the plastic shield is certainly helpful, but this stand does not support/fit my large cookbooks. Also, there is not enough back support for my paper-back cookbooks; they just kind of slouch. It seems to be made for only one kind/size of cookbook. I'm not too impressed, and I'm looking for a more substantial cookbook holder."
3,Not a bad read,"Having read quite a few of the 43 books that make up this series and having always thought the earlier entries were the best I expected another good read as this is the 2nd of the Sundance books.The book starts well with a tough battle with Indians, which is very quickly followed with a brutal fistfight between Sundance and an outlaw leader called Gannon. Unfortunately the book goes into a slump afterwards as the plot is outlined, the search for Maximilian's priceless treasure of lost jewels.The jewels are said to hidden deep in Apache territory and once Sundance meets up with the Apache the book picks up again and ends with some great action as Sundance and Cochise team up to take on Gannon and his gang between them.Shame about the slump, otherwise not a bad read."
4,Melville From the Hip,"This edition of Melville's ISRAEL POTTER is one of the most accurate will will have in terms of text and also a good introduction to the lighthearted side of Herman Melville. His satirical portraits of Great Americans and their various hypocrises are central to the book, as the battle action of John Paul Jones is to adventure.For those interested in a more modern interpretation of the Israel Potter legend, see GONE OVER by David Chacko and Alexander Kulcsar--one of the best books of 2009."
3,Sub par for 'Goddess of Song',"The first Sissel CD I bought was ""Into Paradise"" where her astounding, sonorous tones are allowed full breadth of expression. This album, however, I was slightly disappionted in. The song selection does not appeal to me as well or emphasize her voice as fully. Still, as a record it is very lovely. It depends on what you expect..."
3,Sissel CD,"Sissel's voice is simply captivating, gorgeous. I'm not a fan of the material, though- too operatic for me. Perhaps some Christmas music would be more suitable for me."
5,Too Good to Lose,"I bought the first season of Men of a Certain Age because I wanted to have it to see now and again what real television drama is all about. Ray Romano, how could you have let them cancel your show? This series had the most complex plot lines and the fullest, richest set of characters of anything on the tube. Each hour segment examined the three ""men""--the love life of Terry (Scott Bakula), the aging Lothario, sometime actor; Owen (Andre Braugher), the overweight, put-upon car salesman at his father's dealership; and Joe (Ray Romano), the owner of a party supply store who dreams of making it on the senior golf tour but who is still fighting a compulsion to gamble. Talk about intricate plot lines. My next question, when TNT cancelled the show, why didn't one of the other networks pick it up? Instead, we're treated to stupid reality show after stupid reality show. Come on, Ray, push it at NBC or CBS or ABC until one of them brings it back."
3,Confused why I'm not able to purchase the entire season.,"This is not (yet) a review of Season 2. I enjoyed the first season enough to want to watch the second. It moved me to laugh, cry, squirm, and more. I'm puzzle that I'm not finding a way to purchase the entire season at a discounted rate, as I did the first season. After several explorations of my options, I feel frustrated because I interpret the results as a form of ""bait and switch,"" which Owen could easily explain. If I'm simply missing something in the process, I'd love to know how I'd resolve it, as the Help feature is also not obvious to me at this time."
3,Close but no cee-gar!,"I have a vintage glass windchime to compare this to (which I bought for just over $1 about 25 years ago). Since my old one has lost a couple of pieces of glass, I ordered this. It's not as big as my old one, and the glass is much thinner so there is hardly any tinkle. Disappointing."
3,A bit $$$ and had to re-string :(,Like the other reviewers these chimes evoked many childhood memories. The price was worth the nostalgia until I received the package and had to re-knot 4 of the glass panels. Very tedious and I ended up using thread and super glue. Not too happy so far.
3,Where's the chime part?,They are great to look at and remind me of my childhood. But this is a replacement for some I broke and neither of them made any noise--and I keep them outside where I have several other chimes. These do not make any noise that I can hear. But they are cute.
2,Glass windchime,"I bought this as a gift. It is very poorly made, the strings are thin and weak. Not worth the price at all. Also the plastic it was wrapped in looked like it had been lying around for about 50 years. Costly for the workmanship."
5,wind chimes,was exactly how I remembered it from my childhood. am very pleased with it. would recommend it to anyone who is nostalgic for the good old days.
5,Loved it!,"I loved this shared insight of the author's life from the womb on up,hysterically and emotionally through her fabulous cartoon illustrations. Great no matter what your sexual preference is!"
3,too many seeds,Caper berries are delicious. I first had them in a tasty salad at the Galaxy Grill in Manhattan. This particular brand of caper berries is okay but there is too much of a frequency of biting into a berry that is too mature so you wind up with a mouth of seeds which is not pleasant.
3,funiculi funicula,"This is a criticism of Amazon.com ... Whenever you list CD's for sale, you should always have a sample for us to hear.. This only needs to be a few lines or notes from the CD... Other stores have this available for the customer and I think you should do the same... Unless this is available, I probably won't buy any more Mandolin CD's from Amazon.com..... Thank you.... Horace Sher"
1,soooooooooooooooooo short,dont buy this albums or the volume 2. its was so incredibly short. i couldn't believe i paid for such short songs. there only like 1 minutes each.DO NOT BUY!!
1,This book is not as good as others in the same series.,"Well, I already had ""Mierda: The Real Spanish, etc."", so I decided to buy this one. Italian is my mother tongue, so I bought this book to give it to a friend of mine studying Italian. I had to change my mind. The book is plenty of primary-school-level mistakes that, if you are learning Italian, actually makes the book pretty confusing, and that however aren't acceptable in any instruction book, even though about ""bad"" words. The vocabulary also is very much ""regional"" (mainly based on the dialect spoken in Tuscany) and so some of the words won't be understood outside that area. It is a pity, because the book about Spanish is pretty good. The book requires to be thoroughly revised by someone with more familiarity with standard Italian to make it worth even its relatively cheap price."
1,what an ugly book,"I am italian and I was having a look at the book and I think it is really badly conceived and with so many elementary grammar mistakes. I could find at least 10 errors. For example it is an ELEMENTARY italian grammar rule that the feminine article before a feminine noun gets the apostrophe (un'assatanata) and NOT un assatanata. You say UN'AMICA and not una amica. You san UNO sporcaccione and not un sporcaccione. You say SPUDORATA not spudErata.... Just to mention a few errors... And the translations that he sometimes uses are obsolete: when I see a hunk guy I don't say ""uno forte e ben armato"" . Give me a break!!!!Mr Delicio did really a poor job, evidently he doesn't really know the slang language really spoken by italian people."
1,13th Century Tuscan is not like present day Italian,"Mr Delicio in his comments state that ""Every Italian knows that Dante converted Tuscan into the Italian language."" Well, I am sure he won't be able to read the Divina Commedia in an edition without extensive notes. In any case, the errors are misleading and there is a lot of them, I just wonder why, now that is known, somebody knowlegeble in standard Italian cannot review the book and correct its *many* mistakes. I did not understand the remark about the ""idioms"" of Lecce and Naples, I assume the author knows Italian is the official language in those cities also, or he doesn't?"
4,Funny,More X - rated then I thought.Great for laughs from those who really know italian.Wonder about those who don;t :-)
5,Merda! Great book,If you really want to learn Italian slangs and get nasty you need to get this book.
1,Raunchy - and that's being polite.,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. I bought it as a gift for an associate that was moving to Rome. Unfortunately, this book goes way beyond slang - it's simply vulgar. Most of what is in the book wouldn't be allowed on the Amazon website.Give this a pass!"
4,A must have for Manilow fans,"If you collect Manilow recordings, this was the first. It has the ""Sing It"" recording of Barry as a child with his grandpa outside a recording studio. The was Barry before anyone knew who Barry was."
4,No Mode on Display?,What is up Nikon? How do I know what mode I am in when it is dark? Sure there is a backlite LCD panel but it doesn't tell you what mode you are in. And since the program dial just spins around you can't count back what mode you are in either. I guess I will have to carry around a pocket light. Why did Nikon take away such a basic feature. Also the AF illumin. light doesn't stay on long enough and takes too long for it to light up again. Oh and fix the dust on the CCD issue. Come on camera guys we are forking over thousands of dollars for this stuff and still dealing with dust? Even the cheaper digitals have solved the problem. Overall not a bad camera. WB is too warm on A with flash. Nikon still has some homework to finish.
5,The Work Horse,"I have had my Nikon D70 for just over 4 years now, and yes it is my first digital camera. Yes I still shoot film. Just yesterday I shot 9+ hours with this camera on one battery! My wife's D3100, dead after 7 hours. My sister in law's Cannon Rebel, dead after 7.5 hours. I was still shooting. This camera is a work horse. Drop it, smack it, treat it like a Nikon, it can handle it. It does not have all the bells and whistles of the newer models. It only shoots 1.5 frames a second. It's review screen is really small. It only takes CF cards. It is heavy, which I like. The ISO only goes up to 1600. It processes photos really slow. So for all the negatives, I still love it. When I upgrade, I want to keep it as a back up or for someone who wants to get into photography."
4,Excellent Camera ... but very bulky!,"Many of my best shots have been with this camera and I find it fast when taking consecutive photos. Colors are average while manual functions are tedious.. This camera is quite bulky for travelling but gives you good shots. I recommend having a professional SLR camera together with a compact camera like FUJI F10. The colors and clarity of the pictures of the 6 MP FUJI are superb to the Nikon D70, not to mention the feather weight of it."
4,It's BARNEY!,"What else can you say, kids LOVE Barney. Parents will want to insert ear plugs and pretend to watch - but kids just love the purple dinosaur. So, if it's holiday time - this is the video that will entertain your child time, after time, after time,....you get the picture. p.s. It's also educational - like ALL Barney videos."
5,A great Christmas video for Barney fans!,"My daughter, who just turned two at Christmas time, really likes Barney and this video was a big hit. I personally find it less annoying than other Barney videos for some reason. Perhaps it's just more acceptable to be sickeningly sweet at holiday time! My three year old niece also enjoyed watching it. This year she was old enough that holiday stuff could really be fun (she had fun when she was one but not quite the same) and I liked that she could have the typical things families do at Christmas (decorating, carols, etc.) reinforced in the video. Anyway - I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday video for a small child."
4,Good -- But my son likes the older one better,"I thought this was a good tape. However, My son likes the older Barney tape called ""Waiting for Santa"" much better--It captures is attention and interest. I think the new Barney ""Night Before Christmas tape"" is for children who already understand the concept of X-mas and Santa. My son is 19 months and ""Waiting for Santa"" seems to be more entertaining for him. It seems to cater more to entertaining than to the X-mas concept."
5,Barney Video,Our special needs son LOVES all the Barney videos and we have to replace his favorite ones often. He plays them everyday.
2,not worth the money,"My husband accidentally bought this VHS tape, thinking it was a DVD and it is THE biggest waste of money! My daughter loves Barney, but the picture quality and sound are utterly pathetic, she can't even watch it. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy this."
5,Excellent clips and good variety,"My usual complaint about nature programs is that they show the same animals again and again (aka apes, polar bears, sea turtles, elephants) and leave out the other99% of wildlife that is just as amazing and in many cases more interesting (what DON'T we know about Apes for instance). And the new age/choir music you can leave that out of my nature shows please.Like the ""Water Life"" series this one I will watch many times over, has a home movie feel to it sometimes but that is okay by me, just bring on the other 99 per cent of these interesting animals and leave the other overexposed animals alone!"
5,Loads of Pictures!,"This is the second set of Contest Winning Annual Recipes from Taste of Home. Great recipes accompanied by pictures of nearly every recipe. Includes Snacks and Beverages, Salads, Soups and Sandwiches, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Breads and Rolls, Brownies, Bars and Cookies, Cakes and Pies, and other Desserts. My favorites...Chocolate Almond Brittle, Turkey Ravioli Lasagna, Creamy Seafood Enchiladas, Red Pepper Soup, Spinach Cheese Swirls (like a loaf of spinach cheese bread). Yummy!"
3,Contest Winning 2005,"Product arrived on time, but was sent in a mailer. The sides were dented in as well as the binder. As a person who loves books and tries to keep them in perfect condition this bothered me."
1,Crippled by Lack of Graphics,"The author appears knowledgable about his subject matter, but the manner in which the material is presented leaves much to be desired. The book suffers from a lack of graphics. Without any graphics (flowcharts, timing diagrams, etc), the average reader will have a difficult time understanding the concepts that are presented."
1,Skip it if you have any programming experience at all,"Most of this book (I would venture 80%) is padding. It could have been reduced to about 20% of its volume to provide a little more bang for the buck. The most trivial SQLCE commands are given full (such as it is) explanation complete with examples in C# and VB. I mean, do we really require separate full treatment for every common operator and function? Save your money."
4,Got me Through SQL CE,This and another book got me through the limitations of the .net compact framework. This book helped me understand and code my first .Net Compact Framework PDA application. I used it to build an actual application. This is a down-to-earth-make-it-happen book. I hope no one else buys it so that I am one of the few that can use SQL CE effectively!
3,Not a bad toy,"Considering the Sigma 600mm mirror will run you over 4 times the price of this lens, its not a bad deal. I could not coax sharp images out of it though, but considering that it is a long lens at f8, that would be challenging with any lens without autofocus.To get an idea of what this lens can do, search Flickr for ""Catadioptric"" or ""Mirror Reflex Lens"" for some comparison shots between this and the Sigma"
1,"Unless you are really hard up for a long lens, pass on this one","Every thing works, but the lens is very hard to use and pretty much impossible to use hand held. It is not sharp. I got better images from another lens at half the length, blown up to the same size."
1,Dont waste your money!,"I don't even think this lens deserves 1 star! It is junk. Not Sharp, very hard focus! Don't waste your money!"
2,Doesn't fit onto my camera,"I got the lens within a few days. Looks great, and I cant wait to use it. However, I went to put it onto my camera, and it won't attach. Very disappointing, now I have to hope an adapter exists. I have a canon eos xs, which it should fit into. :("
2,I guess I didn't do my home-work!,"This lens is either not very good, or I just havn't figured out how to use it...On my Canon 20D, does not make ""colorful"" pictures...But hey, it is a very economical lens..."
2,For Die-Hard Jet Li fans only,"AKA Shaolin Temple 3, this movie is a decent display of Jet Li's kung fu prowess. If the version being offered is by Telefilms International / Beverly Wilshire Filmworks - buyer beware! The film is NOT widescreen (as it says it is), and the subtitles are cut off by the formatting. If you are a Jet Li fan like me, you will enjoy the action sequences, though they are sparse. Creative stances and good moves from Jet save them. I recommend this film to die-hard Jet fans ONLY - kung fu purists will be very disappointed. Jet Li picks up his role as the orphan raised by Shaolin, his sifu from the previous two films returns as well. If you like Jet, and like the series, go for it. Not Jet's best, not his worst, either. Picture and sound quality is poor. Directed by Lau Ka-leung."
4,Nice but not a remastered version,"This is for true Jet Li fans. Excellent Shaolin Action. And forms, speed just the exquisite style Jet Li is known for. Good story line, Only thing is the picture quality could have been better. I don't think there is a remastered version out there. If so let me know. Until then this is a must see Jet Li Film.Truly Good Shaolin Action."
1,avoid this thermos,"Avoid this thermos only keeps coffee warm about 2 hours , even with pre heating with water. thermos looks great , it just does not work. buy the classic instead!!!!!"
1,Incomplete edition,"A wonderful book, when it's complete. But the idiot who produced this edition seems not to have grasped that the preface is part of the book, and that it lays the grounds for the plot, so he or she or it left the preface out."
2,Awful Valve Oil,"cheap, yes, but i just used the valve oil for the first time on my trumpet and it has an amazing quality of gumming up almost instantly when i play. save some long-term $ (and your trumpet) and get a quality piston oil.other than that, the rest of the kit is cheap; the handles come off the brushes easily. the slide lube seems ok. $10 + shipping down the drain."
2,Arista has mainstreamed BlackHawk...ARGH!!!,"I guess since BlackHawk's last album, Love And Gravity, stiffed when it came to sales, Arista told the boys that they have to become more country mainstream. This meant songs being forced upon them and there back-up band, BackHawk was not allowed to be on the record. There You Have It was OK, but there is another song on the album with the same hook. The only thing redeeming at all about this one is Dave Robbins' song Always Have, Always Will. It's a plaintive ballad that tugs at the heartstrings. Way to go, Dave"
5,"Tight harmonies & vocal variety makes ""The Sky's The Limit.""","The harmonies of Blackhawk are tightly woven on every number. Mark Bright and Tim DuBois have done a great job producing this album. Every song is a number 1. The ""Your own little corner of my heart"" cut is a solid chart topper and reveals the very best of Blackhawk. The tight harmony of Dave Turnbull (who is this guy?) makes that song destined for the top of the charts."
1,IT IS SO REDUNDANT! A TERRIBLE SONG.,"...IT, ...IT, ...IT! I KNOW ANOTHER WORD THAT ENDS WITH ...IT, AND THIS SONG IS A PIECE OF ...IT!"
5,Good Book,"I know this book was originally 3 seperate novels but, I liked how it was all combined into one. I thought it was pretty unique to have three divergent plots actually fit together, beautifully, to form a single coherant story."
5,"Great characters, compelling suspense, brilliant ecofiction.","This grittily realistic novel features suburb character development, great storytelling, and an incredible evocation of place. Johnson parcels out clues and new information in a way that slowly sheds light on both a previous crime and a complex current situation. Johnson provides implicit commentary on land development scams, Indian-racketeer colusion, loyalty and friendship between the lines. It's also a first rate, non-sentimental love story. Fans of David Guterson and Cormac McCarthy will join those of Louise Erdrich and Louis Owens in their appreciation of this excellent novel."
1,"Wanted to enjoy this, but couldn't","This is a part of the world I was familiar with having visited the North Minnesota woods as a kid. His descriptions of the area were accurate and his spending a large portion of his life there was evident. However, it was a struggle getting through this as he was all over the place, characters, time, etc. I basically fought through this to finish it, and in the end it was very unclear what was really going on.Not a very good read, even though I was very excited about it upon finding it."
5,Awesome Crime Fiction,"The two negatives: 1) the book takes about 60 pages to get up to the suspense level where it's impossible to put down, and 2)it's not overly idiot-friendly. Both of these drawbacks are negligible when you consider that it provides an awesome plot in an unforgettable and palpable world -- one you've probably never seen before. And for the first time since JD Carr, a mystery writer is crediting the audience with the kind of intelligence that draws them to mysteries in the first place. On top of that, it moves like a locomotive. You want stupid, read John Sandford's ""Prey"" novels. You want a spooky, gripping read that will make you feel like you've lived through something intense, try Wayne Johnson."
4,Good but really not the best,"I'll be honest, I bought this album with high anticipation but I listened through and couldn't help thinking to myself that they could have done better. ""Melancholy Empire"" is a pretty catchy song and so is ""Alchemist of Sorrows"" For anyone getting into Cathedral, I suggest getting ""Carnival Bizzare"" It focuses more on the stoom element other than traditional doom Cathedral fans are used to from previous albums. Check it out. You might like it more than me."
4,Return to Kyuss,"I've loved Cathedral since Soul Sacrifice. Though this album is sort of like one big Voyage of the Homeless Sapien, it's a welcome return to the headier side of heavy rock. It's been a while since something this complete and voyage-like has been released. It's as though Cathedral spent a few months listening to Kyuss and Sabbath and got back to their roots. Good stuff."
5,"Dense,Heavy,Rough Great Album","Endtime is the best Cathedral album, is their most extreme and brutal work , the artcover and concept is dark, the music is so fascinating because of the slow rithm , rough riffs , poetic lyrics , original sound effects, check out the noises in ""whores to oblivion"" you can imagine giant stones being carried on the ground , intro ""cathedral flames"" is delicious, ""melancholy emperor"" have incredible vocals with Lee Dorrian voice with distortion as emerging from beyond , ""alchemist of sorrows"" includes constant changes of rithm very black sabbath , Cathedral should record another album such as this one , I would love toHM"
4,A second Equilibrium,"This Cathedral release, as others have stated is a return to there traditional format of heavy, crushing riffs and drums, performed at a painfully slow tempo.More for fans of traditional doom, and their 'Forest of equilibrium' release, rather than those who got into the band through lets say The etherreal mirror or carnival bizzare. Nothing new, but something to pass the time while your baked."
2,very unimpressive,"forest of equilibrium is the only full length cd of cathedral i didnt buy. this one i took back cause it has some real muts on it for songs. they have regressed to the point where only stoned out people in a coma could enjoy this elongated boredom of a cd. i could only handle listening to 5 of the 9 songs on here, the rest could make me not mind being deaf. the 13 minute templars arise is without a doubt the worst song this band has ever recorded. i loved there last 4 cds (ethereal mirror, carnival bizarre, supernatural birth machine, caravan beyond redemption) the music is slow boring and unintersting. i dont see how anyone could like this cause theyve regressed. i dare any reviewer to say they like templars arise cause that is 100 percent crapola. yuck yuck yuck this one does suck"
5,A HIT DON'T MISS OUT.,"FLYING GUILLOTINE IS UP THERE WITH THE BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE OF ALL TIME. PREVIEW: THE EMPOR GET A GROUP OF MEN TO LEARN THE FLYING GUILLOTINE SYTLE TO ASSINATE TRAITOR IN LAND, WHEN A UP AND RISING FIGHTER DON'T AGREE WITH THE METHODS HE ABANDON THE TEMPLE AND IS ON THE RUN. I WAITING FOR THE FLYING GUILLOTINE VS THE ONE ARM BOXER. NOW IF THEY GET THAT. THAT MOVIE WILL REALLY ALMOST COMPLETE MY COLLECTION, I CAN HAVE KUNG-FU THEATER AT MY CRIB!"
2,OFF WITH IT'S HEAD!!!,This movie is for the true fan of the the classic Kung Fu movies. The fighting is sparse and none too impressive. The overall story is good but lacks much of the action to compete with the other classics. The premise of decapitating your foe is interesting at first but loses its luster quickly. Having to wait until the end of the movie for the big fight scene isn't worth it.
2,Card Tray does not rotate.,The Card Tray does not rotate. I should have just bought a stationarycard tray. I feel like I got ripped off.
3,Plus and minus about card tray,"The quality of the materials is very good. The minus is that the feet do not adhere well to the table, so we end up sliding the ""rotating"" tray around as we would any other card tray."
1,not 2 decks,This unit does not hold two decks on one side but it does hold two decks if you put them into both sides. Not the way one would use it.
2,Revolving Issue,"The playing card tray was fine but the revolving feature did not work. With one hand lightly holding the tray, I attempted to turn it. With my assist it turned but the screeching sound was unpleasant. I thought some 3-In-One oil might help, but there was no way to access the inner mechanism. I have returned the product and have decided to search for a revolving card tray locally."
2,this keeps falling apart.,this keeps falling apart. after turning it a few times it breaks and we have to reassemble it.Would like better quality.
3,It's OK,"I didn't need it to revolve, but I couldn't locate a CLEAR, non-revolving, holder.It is more than I neededed."
4,Good buy,Item was just as described and proved to be just what we needed for the grandkids to be able to hold their cards.
4,Can't find these in the stores!,"I looked all over for this Canasta tray. Nobody carries them anymore! I didn't really need one that rotates, but the best price is right here on Amazon. Thanks for carrying ""hard-to-find"" items!"
5,2 Deck Rotating-Revolving Card Tray,The tray works well. I was used to a non-revolving tray and was looking for additional trays. This one was recommended to me and I like the revolving one. It makes playing at a larger table easier when each player can turn the tray to reach the cards.
4,card tray holder,"I thought the base under the tray was a bit small, so that sometimes the whole tray would tip down, when taking a card. Other than that it works fine. The service and delivery time were great."
4,Uno card game hlep,"Instead of Canasta, we use this when we play Uno. The cards don't slide all over the table. The only problem was that becasue of the base that allows for ratating, the cardholder rocked on the table. This was corrected with a pair of wedges."
1,disappointed,This card tray came in pieces!! Due to bad packaging. Will not re-order from this outfit again.
2,Not as showen,When I received the trays they were not what the picture showed on the website. When I contacted them they said that it was not the right picture and I could return them. This was not posiable because it was for a gift.
2,teeter totter tray,"a little dissapointed in the product. My family plays cards during the holiday get togethers, and this product wasn't as sturdy as what I remembered using as a kid. The entire tray was unbalanced and the deck kept falling over because of it."
3,Playing card traay,The trays that hold the cards extend beyond the base causing the tray to be unstable when cards are placed in it. It needs a larger base.
5,Great card tray!,I purchased this product to use in a canasta game that I play in once a week. This product is great. It houses the cards perfectly and is extremely stable.
5,Just what we needed,"The card tray/holder is perfect for our needs, very simple, hardly needs a review. It does what it is supposed to do."
3,Revolving Playing Card Tray/holder,"Holds 2 decks of cards nicely, however I was a little disappointed in that the tray does not swivel well."
4,card tray,I really like the card tray and gave it as a gift for friends who came over to play cards. They loved it and were glad to take it home.
3,Needs modification,"Regardless the condition of the playing cards, I need to position a weight block on one side for the unit to function properly."
1,CHML FOR 1997 F-150,"This is a very nice-looking light. However, it was not the same length as the OEM light on my truck, coming up 1/8"" short on the length of the lens. And the body of the light assembly would not fit into the light opening on the vehicle. RECON said they never had a problem with this applications before. But I had no choice but to return the unit and purchase another (different) brand LED light."
5,comforting,"I really like the Cocoa Spice for a winter evening. With a dollop of whipped cream and extra milk,it is excellant for hot cocoa and a warm relaxing nite with a good book.Maybe a touch of spirits if you desire."
5,Loved it!,"I bought this tea several years ago and loved it. The store that i bought it from stopped carrying it and I couldn't find it. I am so happy to have this tea again. I love to drink this when I want the flavors of cocoa without the heaviness, sweetness and calories."
3,Definitely tastes like vanilla hazelnut,"I'm not a HUGE fan of flavored teas, but this isn't bad. It's not too heavily flavored or overpowering, but I'm just not a huge fan. A nice alternative to coffee."
4,Cool pictures,"This is a great book to introduce the prehistoric mammals to your kid with. I really liked Ruth's illustrations as a kid myself. My son enjoys looking at the pics too. As a resource, it is pretty weak- but there is very little in print at all for kids on the subject."
1,Open Boredom,"I didn't set this worthless book alight in order to save a precious match.Don't waste your time on this drivel. If you are looking for the most unrepentant, salacious and slanderous gay hollywood exposes, please consult the utterly unputdownable biographies of Darwin Porter. You will be stunned and amazed...."
4,Very intelligent and insightful,"The author examines Hollywood like it is a set decoration being used in a movie. He shows us the attractive scenery (the Hollywood that middle America sees every day), as well as behind the scenes: the nails, glue, and sandbags that hold the set in place. In this case, however, the nails, glue, and sandbags are decades of deception, denial, and hushed tones that the industry continues to use. Ehrenstein writes with a knowledgeable pen, yet rarely if ever comes across as smug or elitest. His narrative is conversational, but structured. It allows the reader to understand better many individual stories in Hollywood's past and present while showing them in context relative to time and social acceptance. ""Open Secret"" is well-written and comprehensive."
3,Heroes in Hell,"I picked up this book at a used book sale because the title and cover caught my attention. I bought the book because the synopsis intrigued me. When I read the book, I laughed--I became absorbed. I could see the individual parts leading somewhere. Suddenly I was on the last page, and still wanted to read more. I'm can't wait to find other books in the series."
1,"Looked like ""fun trash""; wasn't any fun!","When I was thirteen, my brother and I spotted this book on the shelf at a drugstore and thought it must be just the coolest book ever! Dead bad guys battling it out in Hell? Who could ask for anything more? Twelve years later, after receiving this book as a gag trip-down-Memory-Lane gift, I am asking for EVERYTHING more! Normally a short story collection that uses a central theme is somehow connected and works towards a final goal or resolution, but this group of tales does neither. The main characters, all once great leaders and/or ""heroes"" in life, are in this book static and one-dimensional, never giving the reader any impression that they are included for any purpose other than to lend their famous names. This was a wasted premise, a painful book to read, and ultimately unfulfilling.Even at thirteen, I would have been disappointed....."
3,Masterpieces???????????,"Don't be fooled by the title. There are very few ""masterpieces"" in this book. Even the stories by ""masterpiece"" authors are not their best (Asimov, Heinlein, Silverberg, Ellison, and Aldiss, for example). Where are Bester, Wolfe, Zelazny, and and Robert Reed? -- writers whose genius was at its best in shorter venues. Almost half of this book (which is ""The Best Science Fiction of the Century"") is from the 80s and 90s, much by unheard of authors. On top of that Card's introductions are very sloppy. In one he uses the phrase ""science fiction"" three times in one sentence. Quite frankly, I'm not sure that Card actually edited the book. It looks like Ace decided to put together an anthology to boost residual sales, putting the focus on more contemporary work and getting a popular author to put his name on the cover."
4,Solid and Diverse Sci Fi Collection,"This collection of 27 stories, edited by Orson Scott Card, a science fiction writer of acclaim in his own right, is divided into three sections: ""The Golden Age"", ""The New Wave"", and ""The Media Generation"". Many of the giants of the genre are represented here. Mr Card provides a useful general inroduction to the volume and separate introductions for each story. Story selection is good, for the most part. I personally enjoy ""concept driven"" or ""character driven"", as opposed to ""technology driven"", Sci Fi and these stories fit that description. Some of the selections, especially in the first section, have been frequently anthologized and may be familiar to a well-read Sci Fi fan. However, many stories are not so well-known, especially in the two later sections. There is a fairly high proportion of ""gems"", worthy of multiple reads, in this volume. (To be fair, there are also a few duds, in my opinion.) Overall, for the money, a great buy."
2,Masterpieces?,"I was really surprised by the choices included here. While there are some classic outstanding stories, those are almost without exception ones I have read before. There are more than a few completely unimpressive ones. I have been reading science fiction for more than 30 years and there were a number of authors I had never even heard of. When I read the story hoping for an undiscovered gem, I was disappointed. I really don't understand Card's choices here in most cases. Oh well, Card is assuredly more familiar with the genre than I, but I wish I hadn't bothered with this one."
4,Card's favorite SF short stories,"A better title would have been ""Orson Scott Card's favorite SF short stories""I enjoyed reading some of my old favorites and some authors I had some how missed at the time. I was disappointed in the Heinlein story and that Hal Clement has left out. Card admits in the introduction that these are stories that impacted him."
2,the best???,"If these stories are the best science fiction has to offer, I'm surprised anyone ever reads it."
2,blech,"The lead review by McDorman really set the tone. I was grievously unpleased by this putative collection of masterpieces. Some of the stories were good, most were poor, but, overall, very few stood out as obvious examples of science fiction. Frankly, some of my more creative sci-fi-oriented dreams--turned into a few pages of prose--could stand honorably aside many of these ""masterpiece"" entrants. I can scarcely believe that Orson Scott Card couldn't find better alternatives for one or two (or fifteen?!) of these selections; I wonder whether he was ""on the take"" from moribund authors or publishers, or who knows what.The more anthologies one buys, the more disappointed one finds oneself. Honestly, even the best collections of anthologies suffer from a solid 20% ""dud factor."""
2,Timex Men's Expedition QA Watch,The watch works fine but the alarm button/pull came out after only a few weeks of use.
1,Zenith medicine Cabinet,"Order the medicine cabinet, it arrived glass cracked. Called and was assured that they would send another one out and it would have clear packing instructions as to the product being glass. I was assured all would be done so the mirror would not be cracked. The second medicine cabinet came and was shattered once again worse than the first time. Called back and said I would give it one more try, this one was so shattered glass was coming out of the packaging. There was no protection in any of the boxes just thrown in the box. Needless to say never never order anything breakable from AMAZONtZenith Products M30 Beveled Tri-View Medicine Cabinet"
3,"fine product, good price",It looks good installed. Exactly what i needed in my new bathroom. matches everything. Be aware that it sticks out about 4 inches from the wall.
3,"Too Old, look for 9th edition.","Look for the 9th edition or higher.The older editions organize plants into 1st growing zone, and 2nd color.Newer editions organize by 1st growing zone, 2nd color, and 3rd family.This makes it much faster to reach an identification.All editions only have line drawings, in black-and-white.At the time I'm writing this review there are plans to release an updated version.If it includes color drawings or pictures this could become the dominate book for Colorado native plant identification."
4,Stendhal being Stendhal,"I didn't look forward to trying this book---memoirs of childhood seldom do much for me---but there being so little Stendhal out there in translation, I couldn't overlook it. Well, long book tho it is, H.B. is very readable and a lot of fun for those who love Stendhal's style and persona. Chatty, honest, quirky (all those little maps!), skipping around madly, with the strange mix of irony and idealism that makes Stendhal so ""modern,"" this is an enjoyable book for ""the happy few."" I doubt there are many books like it---Rousseau's confessions feel much more polished, & hence less ""real,"" than Stendhal's book does. (Of course I'm agnostic on how honest S. really is---but it's a good book, true or not!)"
3,Burning of books.,"I heard of this book when I watched the movie ""Fahrenheidt 451. I had to get it to read for myself"
5,Great CD,"This is a really good CD. There is a correction I need to mention that you can check on any other sites you would like. Track #6 is not Simon and Garfunkel. It is ""I Love You"" By Climax Blues Band."
3,Not worth it,This item was WAY too expensive for what you receive. It is a spiral bound book for a child to put memories of a lost loved one. Great concept but not worth the expense.
2,Disappointment from NYC,"I have purchased all of the Afterdark CDs, and this one is really disappointing. I was expecting more from the Deep House center of the music world. I have yet to find a CD that measures up to the San Fran disc. Buy that one! If they could only replicate that...."
3,"Warning, this CD is download protected !!","This CD is protected from downloading so you can't use it for MP3 players or an iPod. The music is great, but worthless if you want to listen to it from a source other than the CD."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"This album doesn't even come close to the SanFrancisco, Madrid and the Chicago compilation. It's repetitive, boring and dull. All I can say is save your money and get any of the other good ones."
3,0 for effort,all the beats/songs are the same and the vocals don't rub the right way either. I do own Chi. and SanF. releases and they are far better.
4,Koolatron Multi-Purpose Adapter,"Good product. Used twice already. Seems to run a little hot, but is just what we needed to make full use of our Kooltron cooler/warmer."
3,Works as stated,"It works. The only thing I don't entirely like about it is that it gets pretty warm/hot when plugged in, but so to a lot of adapters for laptops, so it's not much different than them.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 is because of how hot it gets, but works just fine with my Kooltron plug-in cooler."
1,This thing is a piece of crap,"I just got this in the mail on Thursday. Today is Friday and I used it for the first time 4 hours ago and it, literally, melted. Now I'm in a hotel room with 3 kids and no cooler. We're cooling the items that were in the Koolatron in a trash can with ice. BEWARE!"
3,Works - but should be included with the Cooler,"I bought a Koolatron cooler and needed this piece in order to pre-cool the cooler before loading it. During my test, this product did the job, but since it is a necessity with the Kooolatron coolers, it should really be included with the cooler and not be a $25.00 item. That marketing approach is simply not what a high quality company would do. Again, this product worked and you need it if you buy a Koolatron, but since it should be part of the cooler package, I can't in good conscience give 5 stars."
3,Get's hot.,This adapter worked well at getting my cooler cold before putting it in my car and at night when not travelling. The unit itself seems to get hot and makes me wonder if there is something wrong with it. Not sure it's supposed to do that.
2,Koolatron Multi Purpose Adapter,I just received my unit and looked for the other 2 adapters that it shows in the picture. There is only the 1. Why is there a picture of 2 plugs ? ? ? ? Can another multi car adapter be pluged into this ?So that I can be charging up to 3 items? This lacks through information to use this. When I plug my phone into this and it doesn't work it will go back. There is no phone number for customer service???
3,It work but overheats,It get very hot after a short time. Given that I am not sure how long it will last.
5,Keeps the Koolatron cooler operating in buildings,"This has worked great on vacations, keeping the cooler working overnight while in motels and homes."
2,"Well, we are on our 3rd, need I say more :-(","Item does get hot quickly and burns out. We are ordering our 3rd adapter for a future road trip and I'm frustrated that this ""awesome"" travel companion isn't up to par. We have followed all instructions, yet we still experience burn out????"
4,Koolatran 120vAC/12vDC Adapter,"I have used this adapter for a couple times now. It works as designed and described. I use it to power a Koolatron cooler. Not much else to say at this point. Time will tell as to the quality, but I don't foresee any issues. One thing, do not get this item wet, even heavy dew will render it useless. When/If using outside or overnight outside, i suggest covering with a ziplock type bag to keep the moisture out."
3,Should be included with cooler.,If you buy the cooler you will need this product .Should have been includer with the cooler in the first place
1,Defective,"I have had the adapter about 6 weeks. It worked fine for the first trip we took. Now it shuts off after 5-10 minutes. Past my return date, working on how to get it covered under warranty. The cooler does work fine!"
1,Good for a few uses,Cooler lasted less than 5 uses and now does not heat or cool. Customer service/warranty is also worthless. Buy this is you want to waste your money.
1,junk,"bought this product to run my electric fillet knife, and it will not hardly turn it over. do not buy this adapter."
4,Works well...,"Bought this to use with our Koolatron car cooler so we could take the cooler into hotel rooms at night on a five week road trip. Pretty simple device, my only complaint would be that it is big and heavy."
3,slow shipping,Once it came it worked with the cooler. Nice long chord. We were able to put the cooler in the truck camper and plug it into the adapter in the cab.
3,Hot Hot Hot,The adaptor worked great when we were on a weekend getaway and in the house when we prechill the cooler. The only problem is that it gets extremely hot!
5,adapter,A must have with any of the Koolatron products!!! Traveled across SE to SW it was perfect with the P-90!!!
4,Bought with Koolatron Compact Kooler,This helps to just carry your cooler into your hotel room or whatever and plug it in to continue cooling. Works well but my only complaint is that it's LOUD. We usually have to plug it in the bathroom and leave the door closed otherwise it can be very disturbing.
1,failed independent testing,This product was independently tested by Consumer Labs and was found to have only 41% of the Vitamin A it claims to have. Very disappointing.
2,Giant horse-tablet vitamins,"These tablets are very large, very difficult to swallow. I have to chew these vitamins and it's not the best taste."
2,Not so good,"There are many different types of prenatal vitamins, and so if this is your first pregnancy you will probably be just as lost as I was on which is the best for me. I came to amazon and just picked the most bought prenatal vitamin and figured it must be good.The pills are VERY big, and they cause *for me* a lot of heartburn. They make me pretty sick everytime I take them. So I pretty much have stopped taking them. You have the taste in your mouth for a while after taking them.Overall there are many other pills out there that you can buy that are much smaller..if anything else. Stuart prenatal vitamins are pretty popular, and pretty easy to take.As far as rainbow lite, its as if its a punishment everytime i have to take it.So in concluding, id say rainbow lite works, but they are just uncomfortable..And if you could find another brand that works for you, I would try that first."
1,not good quality,I do not like this brand. I don't think my body absorb whatever nutrients supposed to contain in the vitamin pills.
1,Can't even keep them down,"This is day 3 with these and the 2nd day in a row I've gagged and thrown up in the sink. I had been using another kind, but the iron was too low so I switched. It's been AWFUL! Like another reviewer said, its the taste/smell/size combo. It's not working for me AT ALL. and I can take large pills just fine normally, and my other prenatals weren't particularly small either. But they didn't smell or make me gag. Tonight I cut them in half to see if that would help. The first half went down fine. The second I gagged again and threw up in the sink. I give up!"
2,"Smells like dog food, tastes like vomit.",They were the cheapest on the shelf a the time and I cant even bare the smell of them or taste of them. I dont chew them but if you take them with water they taste HORRIBLE.
1,Bad aftertaste and very large pill,"The ingredients seem good, which is why I bought them but they should have split the pill into two and coated it with something because it is nauseating to swallow. If you have a sensitive gag reflex, find something else. Otherwise, you should be fine but I'm trying something else."
4,very good vitamin,"I have tried a variety of vitamins in general, and variety of prenatal vitamins, both prescription and OTC. I'v found that most of the prescription ones are okay, but they just contain the basics with limited minerals and some limited vitamins, like biotin. I found these which have a good number of both vitamins and minerals and none in super excess. They are very large, I don't have any problems with pills, so that's not a problem for me. I haven't really noticed any after-taste as some reviews have mentioned. And most of all, I have found that these are pretty easy on the stomach. I still have to take them after a meal, or with a small snack to eliminate nausea, but with many other vitamins evern that doesn't help! I would definitly recommend these!- one small note to the nauseous pregnant women- the smell makes me very queasy, but if you can over the brief opening of the jar, you should be just fine!"
2,yucky burps,"I didn't like how big this pill was or how 1/2 of the time i took it i would burp and ""taste' the pill and hour or two after i took it."
4,Great vitamins but some days it's hard to swallow.,"From researching about prenatal vitamins, I read these are really good. The only complaint is some days I have a hard time swallowing them. I was taking a multivitamin which is a bit smaller with no problem. However the Rainbow Light multivitamin is a little larger and sometimes hard to swallow. It also lacks a coating where the texture is rough compared to other smooth vitamins I've tried. I noticed if you let it linger in your mouth, it will start to have that dissolving feeling which I think is part of the reason why I'm having trouble.I would love to buy this product again if it was reduced to 2 smaller pills a day!"
2,"When I could swallow them, they didn't hurt my stomach","Full disclosure: I'm not pregnant or trying to get pregnant (taking these on a doctor's advice), so I won't speak to anything ""natally"" about these.I honestly gagged on these, even when I broke them in half and tried to take separately. I have never had a problem with swallowing any pill since 4th grade, so I don't know what the deal was there, but had to stop taking them after two days. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because they didn't hurt my stomach (as advertised) the two days I got them down. That was all my gag reflex could take, though, and they started making me feel ill to look at after that. I switch to gummies."
2,Morning Sickness Catalyst,"Although the product seems to be well made and all the ingredients are plant-based, it made me feel horrible. I have taken myself off these prenatals and started taking a cheaper brand that dissolves easy and my morning sickness has disappeared. They smell terrible, causing myself to gag at just the smell. I've been taking them at bedtime trying to not get sick on them, doesn't always work that way."
4,I like it,Love the product for the price and the volume. Probably the best best I can find online for the Prenatal victamin!
3,Sweaty!!,"Overall, these are a high quality prenatal vitamin that cause only one side effect for me - sweating! I'm fairly certain the vitamin is causing this as I've cut it out and the sweating stopped. I'm currently not pregnant, but take prenatals pretty consistently because I like the impact on my hair and nails. I didn't read anyone else having this side effect, so perhaps it's just me..."
4,No problems with these,"I took the Rainbow Light Complete prenatal vitamins for most of my pregnancy, but at 8 1/2 months decided I could switch from a 6-a-day vitamin to a 1-a-day vitamin. I had a completely uneventful pregnancy with no morning sickness and attribute that to good luck and the Rainbow Light formula. I've been on this one-a-day for a couple weeks and have no complaints. I have not experienced any aftertaste whatsoever, so I really have no idea what the other reviewers could be talking about. As for the size - I looked at many different prenatal vitamins and they all look huge. I haven't had a problem swallowing them, maybe it's from all the practice with the 6-a-day formula (which were smaller, but I gagged on constantly). They do not upset my stomach and appear to be a good formula - although I didn't research brands. I switched to this one-a-day because I had been using the different Rainbow Light formula with no problems."
5,good price,"I really enjoy knowing i'm taking a good vitamin. I cant afford the pricy vitamins they carry these days, but these are just right for my budget. I love the ingredients. Just what I need to grow a healthy baby:)"
4,great product but make sure to take it with a snack,"I decided to take these as my prenatal vitamin for the duration of my pregnancy. I've almost finished my first 150 count bottle and plan to order another. In terms of cost, this product delivers a lot more than other products of a similar price-range. And, unlike a lot of other vitamins, you only need to take one a day. This was the biggest appeal for me since I have problems remembering to take one pill, much less two or three a day. The only reason I rate this product at four stars instead of five is because while they claim that the pills are easy on your stomach, the details of their labling clearly state that you need to take these pills with food. The only time I vomited during my whole first trimester was because I took one of these pills on an empty stomach. Otherwise I've been very happy with their performance and have found that they dont exacerbate my heartburn."
5,Love the one-a-day!,"I like this prenatal vitamin even better than the one I used previously, this one really doesn't smell bad and make me gag, and I love that you can take just one and be done with it."
5,love these vitamins -- so easy on my stomach,I tried lots of prenatal vitamins (solid and liquid) and found these to be my favorite. Most upset my stomach or required too many doses. These were the gentlest by far. I've continued to take them while nursing and am still very happy with them.
4,Vitamins,When you've got to do vitamins they can't usually be enjoyable but I've tried a few and this definitely falls on the more tolerable side of things. These are my new vitamins for life! I don't give it 5 stars only because I have yet to meet a vitamin that deserves 5 stars.
4,Gentle on stomach,As it says it is really gentle on stomach. I just wish that it had more ingredient as compared to prescribed ones. But then again for prescribed ones you may 3-4 times more with insurance.
4,Gives you what you need; if you can handle it,"I'm not a vitamin wuss. Or at least I wasn't before these. Overall my review is positive, these are great vitamins as far as what you get in the whole package once a day (which is a nice perk). However, after a month of taking them, I could barely bring myself to swallow them. It wasn't the size so much as the roughness of the pill. There was no smoothness to it. Just hard for me to get down. I finished the bottle and ordered something else that I take 3X a day that is smaller and very smooth (still natural).If you don't mind slightly larger, rough pills - I would highly recommend this! If you think you might have an aversion, go for more times a day or a different pill."
4,"Good prenatal, a little on the large side","I was overall happy with the purchase of these vitamins. I didn't have a problem taking them...until probably halfway through the bottle. I just got so tired of pill popping (between this and DHA, and others), that these started to make me gag a little. The edges are just a little rough vs a large pill that is smooth.However, they never gave me any illness and it sure is nice to take one a day. But after my bottle ran out, I switched back to 3X day. I also personally just thought spreading the dose of vitamins out during the day might also be beneficial (and I don't have a problem remembering).Overall I would recommend these though! A great dose of everything you need in a natural form (no colors, additives, etc)."
2,Horse pills,I cannot comment on the health benefits of this product - I have to trust the manufacturer that this is as good as it says it is. What I can comment on is that these pills are HUGE and difficult to swallow. The outside of these pills are a bit rough and are harder than all others that I've tried to swallow. I'm going through the bottle while alternating with other pre-natal pills but on the days that I have to take these I dread swallowing them. I normally do not have a problem swallowing any pills so believe me when I say that these are tough to swallow.
2,Mixed opinions about this product,"I have mixed opinions about this product. Although I felt really well in the first weeks, in the 6th and 7th weeks of my pregnancy I felt super bad after taking these vitamins. During those weeks when I was more susceptible to nausea and vomiting, I felt even worse after taking these vitamins. The smell, the taste of pills made me feel really sick in my stomach. Actually when I was vomiting I tasted the bad flavor of this product in my mouth. Today I would not recommend these vitamins. Furthermore, be careful if you are taking these vitamins associated with Rainbow 1 DHA. Please watch your vitamins intake because the excess of some vitamins may be dangerous for you and your baby."
2,Gag a thon,"Although these appear to have wonderful ingredients and are just once a day, I dread taking them because I throw them back up every time, even since I cut them in half. They are so huge, so dry and so wide that it makes me cry to take them. So, for what is worth, go with the organic in the veggie capsules. They are worth taking four per day!"
1,"Be careful, contains controversial ingredient","I did not realize until after I ordered them and had just started using them that this formula contains raspberry leaf. I am not a medical professional but from what I've read and been advised, raspberry leaf must be avoided during most of your pregnancy because it can cause uterine contractions or some other uterine problems. In the very end of the pregnancy around your due date it's ok because it helps tone the uterus. But before that, you don't want raspberry leaf's effects on your uterus until you are getting ready to deliver. By the way, same issue applies to Mom To Be Tea by a different company that makes herbal teas (edit: thanks to Rebecca's comment, I've edited this to say controversial instead of dangerous)."
4,just one,"as the name indicates, you take only one huge tablet a day. it does have strong smell and leaves after taste if you hold it a little in your mouth. my solutions is to take it with milk right before bed time.i did not seem to help my nausea or other stomach symptoms as it claims but still is the first vitamin that i could ever take for such a long time and tolerate it. i am planning to take it also while breastfeeding."
5,Best vitamin I've ever had,"I've tried a number of vitamin, but this one is by far the best! I take it at night, right before bed and have no adverse reactions in doing so. Other vitamins, you'd be amped up for hours taking it right before bed. Ive used these vitamins for both of my pregnancies, last one was twins, and everything was perfect. I felt very confident I was giving my babies the best and continue to do so, as I am nursing 4 month old twins. The only potential con is that these vitamins are larger than most. Trust me though, get over the first few uncomfortable days and the payoff is worth it! You'll feel amazing...you'll feel the difference. I will continue to take these even after I'm done nursing!"
5,Wonderful!,I started taking these when I was pregnant with twins. After they were born I ran out and bought a different brand; within a few days of the generic vitamin my fingernails started breaking! I ordered more Rainbow Light vitamins and feel so much better and my fingernails are growing again! I plan to continue taking them for a long time!!
3,Very large and nausea-inducing,"I don't have much to say about the nutritional content of these vitamins, but I will say that they're quite large. Also if I take them without food, I vomit. Obviously the answer is to take them with food, but I wish they didn't make me so sick. If you have a very sensitive stomach, you might want to try something else.On the plus side, the 150 tablet bottle is a great deal."
3,Good but Confusing,I think these tablets are good. I'm pregnant but can't seem to feel any different taking them. Plus I am scared to take one pill everyday due to the high level of Vitamin A and it's effect on the growing fetus. The daily recommended Vitamin A should not exceed 2500 units while this vitamins offers up to 4000 units of Vitamin A. BE CAREFUL CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THESE AS YOU MAIN PRENATAL VITAMIN THROUGHOUT YOUR PREGNANCY.
4,It has everything one needs,I guess they're okay. My only problem is that these are the biggest pills I've ever seen. They're huge. I've tried breaking them iin half but the the jagged edges sometimes get caught in my throat. I will finish the bottle and probably will try something different.
5,High-quality prenatal vitamin!,I had used the Rainbow Light Women's One Multivitamin and just switched to the Rainbow Light Prenatal One Vitamin now that I am expecting. Vitamin is food-based and only one a day is necessary!
1,Made me so sick,"These pills made me so nuseas I couldn' even eat. I thought it was my pregnancy symptoms but as soon as I stopped taking the pills I noticed a 90% difference, I was able to eat and woke up feeling better. I am usuallly good with vitamins since I have taken them even prior to being PG but I guess the iron may be too harsh on my tummy."
4,Great vitamin,"My wife has been searching for a prenatal vitamin that does not make her through up. This is the product that answered that call. If you have any nausea during pregnancy and normal prenatal vitamins are a problem, then try this."
3,Stomach ache,Seems like a good vitamin - contains 800mg Folic Acid - but when I started taking it I started getting awful stomach aches a couple hours later.. and realized the vitamin could be causing them. Now I take the vitamin at night but still wake up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache.
5,Awesome,"I normally can't take pills because they make me nauseous, so when I read that not only is this a one a day vitamin but it's also great for people with sensitive stomachs I decided to give it a try. I'm so happy that I did, these are great. I also checked the label against other one a day vitamins for women and this one had much more content, so I think spending a little more money on it is well worth it."
4,It is Gentle on the stomach,"This is my first pregnancy and when I first shopped for prenatal vitamin, I did not know what I was looking for.This product caught my eyes because it said "" Gentle on Stomach"" on the bottle.I tried a different brand after I finished the bottle and the new brand was flipping me upside down, causing me terrible morning sickness and heart burn.The pill is quite big but I invested a pill splitter ($5). It so much easier to take the pill and I'll be using it for at least 1 yr."
3,Taste is not good,Taste is like sour yogurt.. the only i've to bought this is because its Vegan Guard. Otherwise i would have tried other options. This may not be a good choice in early pregnancy and can feel you more bad.
4,The Best Out There...,"I have searched high and low for a complete, safe, natural, animal-free pre-natal vitamin. I am glad to say that thanks to Rainbow Light's One, I need look no further. I love the fact that I only need to take one pill a day as opposed to six like some other brands. Moreover, I never realized how much of an energy boost these pills gave me...until I ran out of them one day, that is. Hands down, this is the best option on the market today. The only reason I gave them four stars is their enormous size, which makes them a bit hard to swallow. There is nothing better out there so I guess I'll just have to start cutting them in half. :-)"
4,Convenient choice,This pill has to be taken with food or it makes me nauseated unlike my others in the past. I like the subscribe and pay choice so I never run out.
1,NOT good for skin health!,"After having my baby I wanted to continue prenatal supplements because I felt so healthy on them! These got great reviews so I decided to try them, but IMMEDIATELY gave me horrible skin!! I'm 30, have combination skin, and occasionally get little break outs but nothing major. After three days of vitamins my skin is completely broken out despite continuing my normal skin routine with Murad salicylic wash. What a nightmare!"
2,Excess vitamins?,"I had this prenatal early this year for my first pregnancy. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks... I don't know if its directly related to this vitamin, but every body type is different. I did some research on the vitamins... That's a lot of b12 and vitamin a. Seems like some of the other ingredients are excess as well. Be careful before purcHasing this product. Make sure you get a prenatal vitamins according to your lifestyle and diet. Other than this, it did have a positive affect on my hair... It actually stopped falling."
3,beware item sent is not item shown,"I received this item today and it was a box of 30 tablets in a blister pack, of Rainbow Light Prenatal Care Just Once vitamins, NOT what is pictured. Amazon is resending the item...hopefully this was just a mix-up. But, beware you may not receive what is pictured.These vitamins are great..I just hope they are able to send me the right ones!"
1,Seal Broken Upon Arrival,"My obstetrician recommended these vitamins, so I was excited to try them out. Unfortunately, the seal under the cap was broken upon arrival. In addition, the cotton layer looked like it was pushed out of the way. It was positioned such that it looked obvious that someone had placed their finger inside the bottle. The distributor, All Star Health, said that the seals sometimes get broken during the shipping process by extreme changes in temperature from hot to cold. I feel that if this is the case, the manufacturer should change their sealing technology so that the seals don't break. The distributor offered a refund, which I am taking them up on. However, the refund does not cover the shipping that I paid to get the item, or the shipping I'll pay to send the item back, so there's a $10 shipping loss on a $20-something dollar purchase."
1,Nightmares,"I started taking these vitamins when I first found out I was pregnant (at 5 weeks). I had to discontinue use when I started to get morning sick because it only exacerbated my nausea. In the throes of morning sickness, I started taking a multivitamin suggested by my OB. When I ran out of my OB recommended prenatal vitamin I was 8 months pregnant so I started to take the Rainbow Light vitamin again. Well, the nausea was gone, but I have had the worst nightmares and the most vivid dreams ever since. I can't directly blame the vitamin, but I do not have the vivid nightmares if I forget to take my vitamin. I haven't read about anyone else having this problem and my OB thinks that it is unrelated, but I wanted to share my story. I hope you have better luck with this vitamin than I did."
1,"I would never take these again, nor would I recommend them","I took these vitamins for 1 year before my first pregnancy, 9 months of pregnancy, and then two years after my pregnancy. They did not make me feel nauseous. They are large and can be difficult to take for that reason, but other than that no issues. However, the FDA confirmed in 2009 that these vitamins contain lead, which you can read more about on their website. For that reason I would never take (nor recommend) these vitamins again."
1,No Good,"I don't know what it is in this vitamin, but I started getting hives that come and go all over my arms and legs a few days after starting them. Once I stopped the hives went away. The pills are large but I did not have any difficultly swallowing them. No other side effects at all other than the hives, which were bad enough that I had to completely stop taking them."
2,"Wrong Supplement Facts Posted - Also, Migraines","Purchased these multivitamins for a friend via Amazon Prime (sold by Electronica Direct) last week. The supplement facts posted in an image here on Amazon are NOT what is posted on the Rainbow Light web site nor does it match what is on the bottle. THE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT. As of this posting, the correct information can be found here: [...]Also, my friend has had one or two severe migraine headaches per year for several years. She took these two days in a row and within 8 hours had absolutely debilitating migraines...to the point that she would have been rushed to the ER if they didn't ease up within an hour or two. Yes, she took them with a meal (breakfast) and with plenty of water. No, she is not taking and has not taken any other prenatal vitamins. She did not take one today and so far so good. She will be visiting her healthcare provider in the next few days to see if they can figure it out. She's 6 weeks LMP so about 3 weeks gestation."
3,Beware: These are HUGE!,"If you're dealing with morning sickness and can barely brush your tongue without almost throwing up, you will have a hard time with these pills. I am on Amazon looking for a pill cutter now. Considering the natural nature of these pills, I pray that that won't somehow make them too effective or not effective enough. That said, my bff told me I had to take these. Besides all of the great stuff for fetus, she said that they kept every hair in her head post-partum. She is no longer pregnant but continues to take them daily.UPDATE:I actually returned these and got the same brand but they're called the Petite version. I am so guilt free now. I get to take 3 reasonably sized tablets and get all of the same good stuff."
5,Perfect for a Sensitive Tummy,"My stomach is not a fan of vitamins, but these sit well. I have never had an upset stomach from them. They are a bit big, but I use a pill cutter and it's all good."
5,"Best Vitamins, Hair Growth","I started using the vitamins years ago for hair growth. I always buy them in stores, and finally got the bright idea to check on Amazon. So much cheaper and same great vitamin. Oh, also I started using the regular Women's vitamin from this brand because of the ginger. All other vitamins made me throw up literally every time I tried to take them. These are wonderful."
3,Not for me...,"Bought this based on reviews and it's just not for me. I started feeling nauseous after taking the vitamin. After I found out I was pregnant and had horrible morning sickness, it made it even worse. It was a waste of $ for me since I have a full bottle and have to switch to another brand. Might try out vitamin gummies instead."
1,I would not recommend these vitamins.,"I went for these vitamins because they had a lot of good ingredients and were relatively cheap compared to other vitamins in the market. As noted by other reviewers, the vitamin is very difficult to swallow. I thought I would overcome that problem; however, I dreaded the moment of taking it every morning. On the worst side, it does give constant constipation (I apologize for being graphic), as other reviewers also noticed.I still finished the whole bottle of Rainbow Prenatal so that I would not waste the money spent; however, I went back to the more expensive Oculair 120 VegiCaps (also called Biosyntrx-oculair on Amazon) vitamin that I have been taking for several years prior to trying Rainbow Prenatal. Even though Oculair is more expensive, it's so much easier to swallow having a soft cover of each individual tablet, and I have no side effects from it as I had with Rainbow Prenatal.I hope this helps. Best wishes!"
5,No nausea,I'm very happy to find a prenatal where I only have to take one pill daily (some have 3/4!) it includes everything you need including DHA & it doesn't make me nauseous ! Is totally recommend. Plus at 150 tabs the price is fantastic!
5,Loved these!,Arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered. Great service and product. Would definitely buy from them again. Absolutely no side effects at all and the they don't irritate my stomach.
4,Rainbow Light Prenatal Vitamin,I ordered this product because I read a review that it helps with the growth and shine or healthy hair and nails. I've only been using it for about 2 weeks but I've noticed that my hair is much more manageable. I haven't noticed a difference in my nails though.
4,One a day,"Once a day and no nausea. Two good selling points. ...and now I have a happy, healthy 3 week old daughter so it must have worked. =>"
3,it is good but not very good,Good points1)single capsule per day2)Has all the necessary minerals and vitamins3)Stops nauseaBad points1)My wife started having constipation and with the color of the stool we figured out that the amount of iron intake was getting more for her.SO to check the theory she stopped taking the prenatal and voila..she is back to normal again but she gets nauseated with the other one.2)Have to take an extra supplement for DHAI don't know why but I also felt the calcium amount is very less compared to the daily intake for a pregnant woman and that's why my wife always had 1 glass of milk everyday.
2,Upset stomach,These pills have all the things you could need in a prenatal plus the assurance that there are no harmful additives. Unfortunately for me they really upset my stomach. This isn't a usual reaction for me. I'm taking them now while nursing my son. I took another store brand during my pregnancy with no reaction. But this one makes me sick almost every day. I've tried taking it at all different times of the day but nothing works.
5,Gentle Prenatal,"I just tried my Just Once prenatal vitamins and am happy to say that unlike the prenatal vitamins I've had in the past, these do not make me sick. Perhaps its that these are a natural, food based supplement or perhaps they don't contain such high doses of many vitamins but these are easy to take (yes, a tad big but I've had bigger) and they smell kinda green and earthy, not pungent like other prenatals. Most importantly, they do not make me feel queezy so big plus there. Happy I found these and they are available in most drug stores."
1,Made me sick,"First of all, the pills are huge! They are difficult to swallow. Secondly, they made me sick. I was constantly going to the bathroom after I ate.They made going to the bathroom painful. Once I stopped taking them I no longer had issues. I would not recommend to my worst enemy!"
2,Horrible in Taste,"I am currently taking these pills. Yes, these pill are very big compaired to other prenatal vitamins and they leave a horrible taste in your mouth. No matter what I eat, the taste is still there. I dread taking these pill. I think this gave me an upset stomach,I didn't suffer from morning sickness until I started taking these pills. When I visit my doctor I will get a precription prenatal vitamin."
5,Wonderful!,I switched to these after trying a pill my Dr. gave me in the office (samples). After switching to these my morning sickness calmed down a bit and I was able to stomach these easier. I saw others complain about how large the pill is and I do not find them any larger than any other prenatal vitamin/multi-vitamin. I think they are great and I will most deffinately use them through my entire pregnancy. The ONLY down side is this vitamin does not have enough suggested DHA in it. My Dr. has me taking an Omega 3 vitamin (gel caplet) too. I am ok with that.
5,great PNV!,"Really like this prenatal vitamin. Appreciate that it's a ""once a day"" PNV, compared to many others that are several pills a day. It is all natural, which I wanted, and does have a 'grassy' smell...but that doesn't bother me at all. It is a significantly large pill, so if you have trouble swallowing pills, this is not the one for you. No issues with stomach upset, but I do take it with a meal. Highly recommend this for women!"
3,Great benefits but will not repurchase,I love the vitamin but for some reason I have the hardest time swallowing it. Not sure why because I take tons of supplements a day and this is the only one I struggle with. I won't be buying it again for that sole reason.
2,Adultery?????,I really didn't like the adultery part and that made the whole thing bad for me. The movie started out very well. until when the cheating thing started.
1,Too Big,"These are horse tablets, can't get them down even with alot of liquid and I usually have no problem with pills."
2,Jet Li but nothing special,"Jet Li is by a long way the best MA filmstar around, i would usually recomend anything by him but this is a BAD film! DON'T BUY IT! SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ONE OF HIS OTHER BRILLIANT FILMS.I bought this after seeing ""once upon a time in china""! Go buy that instead or just about any of his other films after 1990!"
2,Born to Defence is actually a pretty good movie...,"As far as Jet Li movies go this one has a decent story with situations that have you grinding your teeth rooting for Jet to take revenge on the U.S. Navy (World Video printed ""U.S. Army"" on the box, yet the subtitles say ""navy"" and they are wearing Navy uniforms) scum stirring up trouble. The condition of this World Video edition is horribly pathetic though! The subtitles are inaccurate and often misspelled and most fight scenes are lost in darkness. I wish there was a cleaner copy than this one with better subtitles."
2,Why Jet Li doesn't direct anymore,"Jet Li is an incredible martial artist, not director. This movie shows that truism clearly. The first action sequence is decent enough with Jet scrambling to stay out of the way of tanks and other war time materials, but after that no fight scene is worth the time. Badly shot and poorly lit film, unfortunately. ..."
5,Some fierce fighting,"I know a lot of others think this movie stinks b/c it has a horrible story line and it's a dark movie and there is not fantasy to it... but what I LOVE about it is that they do some pretty funky fighting. Jet Li actually does some serious funky fighting in this movie. There is a lot of rage, anger, and bitterness that comes out of this movie. I personally like the last fight scene. It's got a lot of boxing/kick boxing style fighting in it from the Navy guys and Jet Li doesn't get to fly around and do much of his 'wire works'(using wires to fly around on). But the best thing about this movie is that they don't make him look like an invincible guy(like they usually do)... and he actually get's beat up pretty bad.I like it myself though, It's not a bad movie. You should buy it if you are a Jet Li fan."
2,"Bad, just bad","I saw this on TNN, and NOW I have heard the worst dubbing job ever. The storyline isn't very bad, but everything else sucks in this movie. It sucks that it was Jet Li himself that put him in this position. That being said, he is VERY young in this movie, and can't act. It's surprising he is as good as he is in the Once Upon a Time in China series, because he showed no promise here. The fight scenes are almost watching in this, but highly NOT recommended by me."
3,Less Than Expected,"Objects In The Heavens was a bit of a disappointment for me. It seemed like a glorified notebook, and the charts and illustrations did not look as professional as in other similar publications. There were no lunar illustrations showing lunar details and names, for such entities as craters and maria. I am sure it will be helpful to me in a number of regards, however, I was not impressed with what I got for the amount of money it cost, especially as compared to other similar guides and charts."
5,"Chaos, Mayhem, Fear, Viciousness, Courage, Kinndess, Love","This is a deeply affecting work, compulsively readable, yet always painful to read, account of the slow garroting of the Jewish community in Vilna. From one page to the next, one is amazed (even now) at the viciousness of the Fascists and the humanity, ingenuity, courage of those they oppressed. God and the devil are both in the details and Kruk gives us plenty of all three."
4,A must have for any TRUE Bad Boy Fan!!!,"This is a great CD except for the random interludes. They got kind of tired after a while and just busted up the flow of the whole album. Otherwise, a great CD."
1,The most f**ked up BadBoy Album Ever!!!!!,"As the big BadBoy fan I was, I bought this album with great expectations. But when I finaly buy this MF:n s**t I was so damn diappointed that I went back to the store and tried to return it. But they said that they didn't want because I painted a beard on Puffy so I had to keep it! But in my rage I calmed down and gave it to my brother. I say 2Pac 4 Ever. F**k BadBoy as a staff record label and as a MF:n crew and if you wanna be down wit' BadBoy then f**k you too!!!If you think like I or just wanna complain, mail me!"
2,"how could no one even mention this, so much for bad boy fans...","why the f*** didnt this album have any of biggies hits??? if it wasnt for biggie, bad boy wouldnt be the ""great"" label that it is, when i saw this i expected to see songs like big poppa, hynpotize but didnt get none! dont get me wrong, some of the songs are good (flava in ya ear remix, feel so good is ok, cant see you) but i just think it shouldve had more biggie on it, it wouldve added more a rap feelm not just r'n'b crap"
5,"High-quality, unique, and from the heart.","This CD exceeds all my expectations. The writing is deep and moving, like it came from the depths of the writer's heart. And the music is touching. It's the kind of music that haunts you all day long and you wouldn't want it any other way.Some of the songs are more rock, others are pop-punk, and still others are beatifully mesmerizing ballads.If you're looking for a high-quality yet still unique CD, this is definately the CD for you. It's worth much more than its cost so you'll be glad you bought it."
5,EXPLOSIVE,"The highlight of this pyrotechnically superb thriller is midway in the film when the audience and hero Jeff Bridges thinks a bomb has been placed in his home, to kill his new wife and daughter. The camera pans in on several normal things, with such intensity and ferocity, you're sure the house is gonna blow: a gas stove has never seemed so menacing.While BLOWN AWAY doesn't have the most original of plots, it has a sincerity and intensity that buoy the movie along, with several expertly filmed sequences. Bridges rushing to save his two friends from an exploding truck; Bridges watching as his uncle (played by Lloyd Bridges) is wired to blow; the climactic explosion on the Dolphin--these are outstanding set pieces, expertly helmed by Stephen Hopkins.Jeff Bridges is marvelous in his role, ably supported by his aformentioned father; Suzy Amis, Forest Whitaker and the devilishly profane Tommy Lee Jones.Hold on to your seats and ignore the critics on this one---it delivers explosively!"
5,A great favorite,"What can you say about a film with Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones???? You expect action and it is surely there. Excellent flick! They are first rate (and first class) actors; loved the part performed by Lloyd Bridges, also."
3,"Weak plot, but COOL explosions","The movie itself is not all that great, and largely due to Tommy Lee Jones' super-fake Irish accent and the movie leaves much to be explained. BUT, if you're into explosions, this movie definitely has some good ones, not to mention some pretty cool bombs and tricky boobytraps which will catch the interest of most of you pyromaniacs out there!"
3,decent action film,"The script is very weak ,and at times it just becomes the ""typical action movie"".However I am a die-hard Jeff Bridges fan and I live in a town right next to boston(where the movie was filmed).It was interesting to see all of the landmarks of the city,but there are plenty of other, better films shot in New England,""Witches of Eastwick"",""School ties"",""Mermaids"".But I dont want to sound to negative so watch it for pure entertainment value."
2,Very very bad,WHen I received this DVD it looked real but when we went to watch it the DVD was blank. Nothing on it. Was very upset.
3,typical B movie,"I might sound a little old but I do remember B movies from my day. dont know what they call them now days but for those of you that dont know, a B movie is a low budget film with a bad to mediocre plot and bad to mediocre acting. the only reason to watch a B movie is usually for the nudity throughout the film. and this is the case the only reason to watch this film is because of ANNA NICOLE SMITH'S nude scenes. if it wastnt for that this film would have never been hurd of unless you came acrosse it at a yard sale. like most B movies that didnt have nudity. yea you might think im a sicko but thats the truth about B movies. sucky acting, poor plots but lots of nudity to make the freaks out their watch them."
5,excellent...buy 2 or 3 copies !,"its nice that they put the 2 best films ever on one disc !...wish they would do the same for citizen kane and casablanca....anna nicole really speaks well, almost like a normal person...which is great....i must also suggest : cobra , roadhouse and next of kin"
1,"don't buy it, even if you're a fan...","I bought it because of the obvious reasons the nude scenes, I also thought, ""How bad can those movies be ?"". Well people, my question has been aswered, they (both movies) are REALLY bad. Keep your money people, instead rent it and ""grab"" the ""important"" scenes with your computer...or download them from somewhere....believe me it's not worth it....PS: If downloading the videos is illegal, just rent it once, you'll see what I mean..."
3,WELL JUST OK,SO I LIKED A LOT SKYSCRAPPER BUT NOT TO THE LIMIT WELL IF YOU SAW ONE MOVIE THE SECOND IS NEARLY THE SAME BUT I THINK IT IS OK TO WATCH IT BECAUSE ANNA IS DEAD NOW SO IT IS A TRACE OF HER PAST
3,Same old same old...,"Sharon Shinn had three plots. One for Archangel, one for Jovah's Angel, and another for The Alleluia Files. In her latest two books (Angelica and Angel-seeker) she has found very creative ways to recycle that plot (and those characters). This gets three stars because it is well written. It loses two because if you've read the other Samaria books, well, you've read this one already."
5,SF for the liberation of women,"It is fortunate that Shinn returns to her wonderful creation of Samaria to tell this story. As always, the main plots are tales of romance of the highest calibre. But in addition there is the detailed description of the repression of women in the Jansai culture, which provokes both thought and feeling. A great book."
3,"enjoyable, but weaker than the others","SPOILER ALERT: I've enjoyed all the Samaria books, but this one had less meat in it than the others. It is mostly romance, with other conflicts and suspense playing a dim backdrop as two young damsels make missteps in their lives and white knights eventually find them, love them, and carry them away, though it's hard to know why. Each of the women has a counterpart -- a friend who makes the same desperate/foolish choices and pays a terrible price for it. I suppose their fates are supposed to add to the suspense about what will happen to our heroines. It was a good ""comfort read,"" but it lacks the larger complexity of the other books in this series."
1,Terrible Body Pillow..,I've been sleeping with a body pillow for over 10 years now and this is absolutely the worst one I've ever had! I've had some store ones wear quickly so I looked into getting a pillow that sounded like it was much better quality and I figured I would get my money's worth if it was that much more. Not at all. It went flat in 2 days and the fibre started separating so that it was empty in the centre. It's really awful. Trust me. You'd be better off buying one at Wal-Mart!
2,This is a BUDGET Hour release!,"Love Rocks Vol 3 actually presents a nice cross section of hit songs. Once again there are few graphics and no liner notes whatsoever.The big problem with this series is the shaky sonics. Once again the db levels are all over the road. On this one, NONE of the songs sound great, some are so-so, and others are awful like ""I Go Crazy"" by Paul Davis.It's laughable that people are trying to get $25 or $30 for this volume.Don't waste your money. You can find almost all of these songs on other releases that sound far better for a fraction of the price.The exception would be ""In The Midnight Hour"" by Cross Country but on this release it sounds dreadful anyway."
2,Looks nice but not a good product,"My daughter was excited to get this recorder, but we quickly realized that it's playability is pretty weak, especially for something that costs that much. You have to blow very softly lest it squeaks. Also, the two pieces come apart too easily, and the paint chips off easily as well. We got better quality and playability from a $4 plastic recorder we bought from a toy store."
3,"Will Appeal To Fans Of New Edition, Troop, And The Boys","In 1992, The Voices (LaToya McMoore and sister LaPetra McMoore, Monique Wilson, and Arike Rice) were automatically potrayed as the girl version of groups like early New Edition, Jackson Five, and The Boys. Their debut album Just the Beginning was not a big hit, but it proved, in some moments, that the preteen quartet had some little potential. The Voices are capable singers, sometimes a little too cutesy, but most the material is somewhat decent. ""Cloudy With a Chance of Tears,"" sounds like a knock off of a Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis joint, and ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"" and ""M.M.D.R.N.F. (My Mama Didn't Raise No Fool)"" are the New Jack Swing tunes that New Edtition's early albums never consisted of, but the highest moment is the hip-hop cover of The Jackson Five's ""The Love You Save,"" equally noteworthy. Very Enjoyable, Just The Beginning showed that The Voices were worth keeping an eye on for the future, but shockingly it'd be the group's only CD."
2,Frustrating Optimus Prime,"I purchased the Optimus Prime Fast Action Battler for my son. He has several of the other Fast Action Transformers and I was impressed with them. The Optimus Prime however is a terrible design. It does a poor job of transforming. The feet spring out in robot mode,and in the truck mode the feet springs are pushing against the truck hood which REFUSES to stay down. My son continually hands it to me to fix. Skip this version and buy one of the others."
3,Pain in the neck to transform - too hard for my 4 year old,"The Optimus Prime is much harder to transform from robot to truck than the other characters. We bought 4 - Bumblebee, Jazz, Ironhide,& Optimus Prime. They are all a little fragile - arms pop off easily, but go back on with no problem."
5,Excellent review of two wars,It gave an excellent description of the action and political misgivings of the Korean and Vietnam wars.
2,Stunning front cover photo.,Great subject for a bio. Beautiful photo inside of Patti and Robert Mapplethorpe standing on their fire escape. Notice I haven't said anything regarding the quality of the writing?
1,Patti Smith Had Nothing To Do With This Book,"The fact that Patti Smith's name follows Victor Bockris' and Roberta Baily's on the book catalog listing is misleading and irresponsible. Patti Smith had nothing to do with this book and neither did anybody who really knew or knows her. As said in the above reviews, it is a poor pastiche of periodical articles and conconcted stories by embittered has-beens and hangers on who themselves never created anything of worth. It is obvious that it's 'authors' did little if any real research on Patti Smith the individual or the artist and, sadly, they do not seriously focus on her work. It's as if they cut and pasted huge portions of the book from the internet while sitting at home on laptops doing google searches. In conclusion, this book is a waste of paper and money."
1,WORSE THAN LAWRENCE WELCK!!!,THIS IS VERY OLD FASHIONED! LIKE 40 YEARS AGO OR MORE. PLASTIC PERFORMANCE. I AM RESELLING IT AT A HUGE LOSS BECAUSE IT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT WAS EXPECTED.
1,Is This a Joke?,"Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, outside the outer limits, somewhere in the twilight zone, there lived four girls, all with weird names. Misty, Star, Jade and Cat, were all products of bad homes. Bad homes with bad parents. After therapy wraps up, they want to stay friends, and so when Cat's adoptive Mother/sister/not-real-sister, decides to die, the girls get together and bury her in Cat's back yard. Anything to keep Cat out of a foster home and get a clubhouse for themselves.No one knows the woman is dead until the girls confess it, to save Cat from danger. And here's the funny part. That backyard/graveyard was in Beverly Hills. 90210.Now, here is why you should not read this book. You should not read this book, because it is bad. As in poorly written, unrealistic, and just foolish. The charaters talk like professers from Harvard and act like the kids on Barney. It's one long 300 page joke."
3,completely unrealistic,"This book, though far from the worst of the Andrews books I've read, still falls short of V.C.'s credibility. The plot is definitely interesting and a little creepy. Still, it's so implausible that I laughed the absurdity of burying Cat's dead mother in the backyard and then redecorating the house and holding parties. Amusing, but completely shallow."
4,This was more like V.C. Andrews style,"I really liked this book better than the mini series it started with. The series was good, but I am used to her thick books, like this one. I thought the story was really good all the way through, things could have ended with a little more excitement though. I think they could have had more happen with Cat. Other than that it was really good!"
2,A good Teen book.,"This book was ok if you are in the mood for some light reading. It was filled with alot of dialect between the characters, which had no purpose for the reader or the plot. The ending left something to be desired. It seemed that the author wanted to hurry up and finish and didn't give much thought to the readers feelings. I felt as if I was left hanging. It's a good book for a teen, yet, I'm in my early 20's and it didn't satisfy me at all. This book is nothing like the original V.C. Andrews books. It's a shame."
5,What A Story!,"I loved the new book in the Wildflower series. In it we learn more about Cathy and her strange family history. Of course the girls have to get into trouble but for what you will never believe. Murder, sex, and wedding bells ring for one lucky member of the OWPs. I would definalty recommend this book to those that have read the other books in the Wildflower series. This is the best part. You get to learn what the end will bring."
4,Good story... not disappointing,"I really liked this book. The first four left something to be desired. I really got into Star's story but I couldn't help but think that Misty was just a whiner. She didn't have it so bad in my opinion. I didn't think she fit in with the rest of the Characters. I couldn't relate to Jade and she was really irritating...which isn't so bad because it made me more passionate about the book. Cat's story was good but I think ""Into The Garden"" was a great book. It really spooked me and excited me. Although the story line was a little absurd and unrealistic, it was not disappointing."
3,Could Be Better,"Into the Garden is a decent book, but the authors could have written in more of Andrews' style. I felt that the whole idea of having four characters being brought together from different backrounds was good, but I really didn't like the miniseries idea. Could be better"
5,"Into the Garden, a teenage guideline!","This book, Into the Garden, was an extremely good piece of literature. The book shows teenage girls what they may face in the future or what they have faced in the past. There are a lot of peer pressures and family pressures that all require solutions. Girls can use these solutions for their own life. They may not have to face the problems others face. Plus this book was an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Sure it may not have blood, but it is a book about real life and real problems, maybe not real people, but characters that can relate to the world as it is today. This is definitely a book for all girls."
5,I loved it!,V.C.Andrews is my favorite writer - I have all of the books. And i can't wait till the next one is published.
5,This is more like it!,"This book was the best of the all the books in the series. The real VC Andrews ""style"" showed all through the book, making the pages turn quicker and quicker. I hope they stop doing mini series, becasue it really isn't like VC Andrews would have done it. I hope they go back to large novels for books in a series, instead of a mini series. But for now, I am happy to say I loved this book!"
2,Rip Off!,Another rip off from the Andrews Family. This is not like V.C Andrews at all! The characters are too shallow and the plodding writing takes you nowhere. The story is too... soap opera-like and predictable.Really dumb!I really loved and enjoyed reading V.C Andrews but things are getting out of hand... don't you think?Skip this.
5,WOW!,"Into the Garden has done justice to this series and VC Andrews. I read the whole series and every page of every book was great. Misty, Jade, Star and Cat were about 4 teen girls that are in therapy and each book is each one telling their story. Each book brings them closer. the final book Into the Garden brings them all together outside of their therapy. Where they learn to become friends. They form a club called the OWP's. They all have a surpise packed in this book but the biggest one of all is one of them looses a parent and ask the others for help. What do they do? Who do they turn to? The ending has a suprising twist. you will have to read this book. I feel if you read the whole series you will have a greater satisfaction with this book."
5,Cosmopolitan April issue recommends this book,"I read about this book in Cosmopolitan April article ""The new way to get over a guy"" and I bought the book.It is an easy read, full of wise and practical advice to understand and heal the heavy emotions after a breakup and stop the pain. Also it shows you how to find and learn the lessons from the relationship, develop more self-esteem and move on.Excellent and really helps !!"
5,Amazing Book,"A friend of mine recommended this book after a bad breakup. As soon as I started reading it, I saw hope.Now I am recommending it to everyone."
5,I Love It,"Marilyn Monroe is the greatest. I love her movies, and her voice. She lived ahead of her time. I wish that she was around today. I would love to have met her. I think that she is such a beautiful woman that had great talents. I want any thing that comes out that has her with it. They consturcted this cd nicely. They put in all the great stuff. The only problem it has is that it ends, so I start it over. It is definetly for anyone that likes great music."
4,Review of timex combo watch,"I like this watch because of it's clean design. The face is clear to read and the red seconds hand really stands out against the white background. I'm glad to see that analog style watches are making a comeback. This watch will be the one to wear on my off days or in a casual setting. The only downside is that the digital window dosen't light up when you use the indiglo feature. Otherwise, this watch works great for me. As for using Amazon to get this watch, that too was easy and the delivery time was fast, espically during this time of year. If I need another watch, Amazon is the website to go to. Thank you."
4,Knitting for the Modern Man or by the Modern Man,"pretty good intro to knitting book. Difficulty builds with each project. Still there was no project that made me jump up and say, ""I have to knit this"""
3,"Somewhat useful for new male knitter, printed in China (and shows)","Overall I would say as a new knitter, this book is nice. It covers the basics, gives you a few project ideas, and in the back of the book there are sources for yarn and male oriented knitting. My only gripe with this (and a lot of other crafting books) is it being printed in China. Maybe it's just I like to ""buy American"" but from looking through the book the binding is glued somewhat poorly and I could see the glue and it looked like with heavy use this book could eventually fall apart. Like I said a lot of knitting books that are printed overseas have similar quality issues."
2,Sorry I purchased it :(,"I'm sorry to say, most of the items in the book are not items I can imagine any man wanting, and therefore I won't be making them. I was quite disappointed. A book with a good array of men's patterns is needed."
1,"slow start, slower ending","I picked up this book because I am interested in Japanese culture and figure a Nobel Prize winning author writing a novel about a religious movement in modern day Japan would be right up my alley.After about 250 pages I kept telling myself ""something will actually happen soon."" Unfortunately nothing did. You could argue that the ending is climactic, but I argue that by the 400th page or so the reader will be so bored and in such a hurry to just finish this monstrosity that the ending will be of little interest and even less impact."
3,What was that all about?,"What really puzzled me after reading the book was: What exactly is Patron's religious movement all about? Aside from preaching that the end of the world is near and people should repent, little else is revealed about the core beliefs of Patron's religion. This is mainly because Patron discusses his religion at a personal level: the deep trances he goes into, his relationship with Guide, the Somersault incident,etc.. Most of the time he talks about his own personal experience rather than putting forth any set of beliefs. So it's hard for the reader to comprehend why Patron can attract so many followers when he expresses his own religion in such vague and abstract terms."
3,Bolingo is All You Need,"I just purchased this CD today. I don't think it's quite as good as ""Sweet Dreams"" but it'll grow on me. The finest song on this album unquestionably is ""Bolingo."" Melanie's vocals are great, it has an exotic flavour to it, and the lyrics are a bit salacious. It's terrific. The other songs have some promise, but you must hear ""Bolingo."" The name is odd, but the song is great. Take my word for it!"
4,Great dance/euro pop album.,This is one of my favorite party CD's. The only downside is that the CD has only 4 songs that sound like dance/euro pop. The others can all be classified as R&B and cheesy Soul Search music. But the 4 songs (the first 3 and then some other one) make the CD worth it.
4,! ! !,I LOVE THIS CDB O L I N G O WIL MAKE U SWEAT!BODY&SOUL IZ TO HOT TO HITGET THISBLAZE YOUR SPEAKAZRAZE DA ROO
2,Not what it could be.,"My Startac was everything it could be so I blindly bough the T722i thinking it would be the same, what a waste. Its got the right hardware, but its the dumb things the software is missing that hurt. You can't sent address entries over the air like most other GSM phones. You can't select what type of clock you want (I find the cute analog clock to hard to read when its so small on only moderate resolution). You can't delete any of the pre-installed images (its my memory thank you). It has to little Java memory to be useful. The camera sucks. The clock is not displayed durring a call -- With such a huge screen and they don't even leave the clock on. The programers should be ashamed to have wasted the hardware. The RS232 camera is also a terrible afterthough."
2,Disappointed....,"Motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture. But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones. If you want a flip phone with good reliability and features, GET the SAMSUNG phone...... I am very supprised that Motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either. They are behind in technology."
2,Not Bad but could be better,"The phone is not really bad to say but could have been designed better, for example, the camera is seperated from the phone which makes it hard to grab it with you all the times."
1,DONT BUY!!!,"This phone should be less then free people should pay you to walk around with this phone. I have owned this phone less then 2 months and I take really good care of it considering, I wipe the screen off every time I'm done useing it I clean it each day, I even clean the lint out of my pocket before I put it in there but still for some reason lint and dust and hairs get under the screen in mine and my brothers and thats not the only problem I spend about 5 minutes each night just trying to get the phone to charge because the charger doesent clip in right or the phone just says unable to charge even of the phone hasent been charged for 2 days. This phone looks good on line and sounds like a great deal with the camera attachment but let me tell you its not. Take my advice and dont buy this phone it is a HUGE waist of money."
1,What a waste!! What a terrible service!!!,"I bought this phone in January of 2003. Since then I've had nothing but troubles with this phone.First of all, some technical shortcomings with the phone:1. Phonebook - You cannot perform a search on phonebook... scrolling tends to be very annoying.2. Ringer - NOT loud enough. I've missed numerous calls because of this reason. Ring tones are very low quality compared to Samsung S105.3. Software - Very slow to respond to button sometime.4. Screen - Not so good resolution. Camera attachment is just there to lure you in.5. Antenna - FREQUENT dropped calls from low signal..."
3,Good and Bad,Good:- has a very addictive games (motogp)-is small in size-color screen-has GPRSBad:- unable to see the screen well in sunlight-camera quality is terrible- menu is slow and difficult to navigate-has no infared nor bluetooth
1,The phone is ok..BUT....T-Mobile's service is HORRIBLE!,"Don't make the same mistake that I did. The phone is why I signed up for T-Mobile (it really should be free..the resolution on the screen & digital camera is poor to say the least)..but what is the use of the phone when you can't even make phone calls during your ""unlimited minutes."" I am lucky to even have a phone call go through without receiving a ""message failed"" or ""network busy"" signal. When my calls do go through, they are usually cut off in mid conversation. I called the customer service center...and their response was...well yes we do know that this is a problem in your area but have no immediate plans of extending your coverage area. Now I am stuck with a contract and a nice phone...but no coverage. The coverage in my area is even listed officially as GREAT by T-mobile. AVOID T-MOBILE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A toy with lousy coverage,"When I first got this phone I was very excited about it, but now I am ready to bail out from T-Mobile and get a different phone and plan.1) The coverage is lousy. As soon as you leave a metro area, you lose coverage. There seems to be no roaming option with T-Mobile, unlike other phone companies.2) The phone is an interesting toy, but the camera is unwieldy and doesn't work very well. The pictures are dim, blurry, and the screen has poor resolution. Altogether a disappointing experience."
5,not that bad,"my dad and grandfather have this phone have the chance to play with them and fiture them is a nice phone a mean a phone the camera is not that good o well is an adition so it wont be to good is not a new phone on the market so you cant coparate with v300 or e715 calls are preatty cleard the voice dial is nice and cleard the game is not good but the web t-zone works great so you can go and play games the polyphonic tones are nicewhen you down load is and good avreage phone battery not a big issue becs my e715 drains fast as well the v300wth avreage use can last 2,3 days so really if you want a feature phone get e715 or if dont have the $ get v300 if you want a nice avreage phone with phone features get this is not all that but is not that bad as people said"
3,Good product,I didnot want the camera but it came with the phone. I haven't used it and don't care to. But the phone itself is so much better than the verizon wireless that I had. I can use it in my house (something I couldnot do with verizon) in the basement as well as elsewhere. The signal is strong and clear. It is not very user friendly but the customer care have been very helpful
4,you will learn to love it..despite its flaws,"this cell phone is pretty good. the best part about it is its durability. being as clumsy as i am, i've broken about three phones in the course of four months and as much as i've dropped this one, it's still working great (although it is quite scratched). it's long battery life is also quite a blessing.however, this phone is probably the slowest phone out there--it takes a good while to turn on and even just scrolling through the phonebook takes a bit of time. the color of the screen is pretty weak, and the attachable camera is basically useless because it takes a really still hand and a lot of patience to get a poor quality picture. lastly, even when it's on the highest volume, the ring is drowned out by some of the newer samsung phones.however, this is the only phone that's lived through various falls with me as its owner (for ten months) and so i'll give it four stars instead of three (the last one is purely out of love)."
2,No thanks,"I've had this phone for an extremely unfortunate 6 months. The other day, it started making noise while on vibrate, so I had to get another one.Good:-display is big and not awful-you can close the phone while the earpeace is in-external ID-umm..reception is..acceptable? (I'm shooting for anything here).Bad:-enormous-flimsy-camera really sucks-screen gets dirty while talking-SLOWWWWW-most ringtones are obnoxious-just annoying and ugly2 out of 5, just don't get it. It's as simple as that. Get an E105 or V300 or something, just don't get this."
3,Good Phone,"This was an ok phone. Don't look forward to taking many pictures with your camera because it is terrible. All this phone is, is a mixture of a Motorola v60 and a Motorola t720. It is a pretty simple phone. If you have second thoughts about this phone, buy the Nokia 3650 or the Samsung V205."
2,not impressed,"This is the absolute worst cellphone i have ever owned! i think that this phone is poorly made. Every friend that I have that owns this phone all have the same problems. After less than a month the screen started blanking out and the ""flip"" has ""flopped""! Not to mention the camera SUCKS! I thought that I just got a bad model and I planned to return it, until I was told by more than a few friends that they all had similar problems. I'm switching to the Nokia 3650. Let's see how that goes..."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD PHONE,"I had this phone for about 5 days before I wanted to toss it out the window. It rings when there is no call comming in and WONT STOP. I returned it to the store where I bought (T-mobile) it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30, they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a ""previously used"" phone. After 5 replacements, I bought a NOKIA. The camera sucks, and the battery life and signal suck too."
1,This is a horrible phone,"Are u kidding me. This phone has made me think twice about using motorola phones. It does have good colors and stuff like that but there are more cons than pros. First of all, I have sent my phone back to Tmobile twice for a new one because the charger keep getting messed up. The camera feature is just more than atrocious. If u are not outside, u probably will not see anything o the screen. It is also an attachment which means that u cant take a picture of someone without them noticing. This is why a phone with a in built camera is nicer like Samsung and LG and Panasonic. I would tell anyone: Dont get this Phone..."
2,Its Ok....,"Do not buy the phone for the Camera. If you are looking for a great camera phone, the picture quality of the Samsung v205 is Much better. However, I am disappointed with the battery life of both..The Motorola T722i is fast.. the color screen is not as bright as the Samsung-- (I cant help but compare the two). However.. iside for apearances.. the motorola has twice as manny accessories and features (including the desktop speakerphone.. and mp3 player addons) so if you are into little gadgets like those, its a great phone. OR.. you can wait until the new Sony Erickson gets to the US-- which has a touch pad face and the features of both without all the addons :-)"
2,"Nice look, but that's all there is to it","The second day after I got this phone, it wouldn't turn on. I had to exchange it for another one. Now, four months later, the end key doesn't work and turns off every time I plug in my handsfree.I called T-Mobile, they said they were going to send me a replacement. They did, but they failed to tell me that it was a refurbished model. It had dirt in the keypad. I had to vacuum it but it's still dirty.I went to a T-Mobile store and was told that they discontinued the T722i because there were so many returns due to defects."
2,Find another phone,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since. It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. My biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly (each push of the volume button makes a beep). I loved that feature on my StarTac. Look elsewhere for a good flip phone."
2,not that great,"Motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture. But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones. If you want a flip phone with good reliability and features, GET the SAMSUNG phone...... I am very supprised that Motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either. They are behind in technology."
3,Not a Big Surprise,"This phone is ok. It is not definitely worth the $250 manufacturer retail. The color resolution is very low. No wonder they give you the camera for free; be aware, it is not an Olympus. I got this phone as a gift so I don't really care because I didn't pay for it. If you look at this phone and you are having second thoughts, please get the Samsung V205."
3,Dont get this phone,"I have this phone and i dont get good reception when im in buildings. The end call button stops working sometimes and you have to turn it off in order to end your call. It is cracking at the top part where it flips. My boyfriend had this problem when he had the motorola 720 and it broke, and he had to get a new phone. My advice is not to get a flip phone because eventually it will break and you will need a new phone. Also, the screen gets dirty easily and I have to clean it with windex. It only has one game and after a week you'll get tired of it."
3,"Cool phone, but reception sucks","I have this phone for almost a year now and I have to say that I am pleased with many of the features on the phone. Like, voice-dialing, battery memory, etc. BUT, a big problem, and I'm not sure if this is due to T-Mobile or the phone, but the reception is horrible inside of buildings. If you are outside no problems, but in any house or building....good luck getting a conversation complete. I believe that T-Mobile has the best plans for the money and I am hoping that it is just the phone that is the cause of all the dropped calls."
2,Poor battery life,"I have owned many phones, but this is the poorest in years. Battery life is 1-3 days without much use. When charging, you cannot make or recieve calls. The rest is OK, but these are such big issues I can't wait until my contract expires so I can go back to Nokia."
2,"mediocre, problem ridden phone","yeah, go with a different phone. this one has been discontinued because it has so many promlems. I've had it for the past 8 months or so and I'm getting ready to trade it in for a new one for the third time.problems the phone often encounters:-end button stops working-randomly dropped calls-answer the phone to both the microphone AND speaker not working-screen not working so you can't tell who's calling-dirt gets under the screen very easilyI'm sure there are more. it's not all bad, but you're much better off with another phone."
1,complaints...,"one of my good friends has this phone and she hates it w/ a passion. the battery life sucks, the screen goes out when u open it too quickly or hard, and the phone itself is flimsy. i was about to get this phone because of the good cash back deal... but glad i didn't. =\"
1,motorola 722i,Don't loose the camera. Difficult to replace with any kind of search and it's expensive. Dumb not to have it built in...wish I had gotten the samsung that is similar to this one. I concur with most of the negative review. This in my only phone and I miss calls all the time.
3,There are probably better phones,I purchased this phone today and im not impressed. The color screen is good but nothing special. The digital camera takes awful pictures but using pictures as wall paper is a neat idea. I had a tough time deciding on the Samsung V205 or this phone but The Motorola T722i has the voice activated dialing( the Samsung doesnt) which was the deciding factor in this. If voice dialing isnt important go for the SamsungV205. The pictures are better and the color screen is better. The Samsung V205 may be more expensive but in my opinion the Motorola isnt even worth how much it cost.
3,Hinge Broke... Glued it Back!,"After using (and liking) this phone for six months, one of the hinges cracked (not from a drop... just from use) and though I managed to superglue the thing together, a phone that retails for this price needs to last longer.If it hadn't cracked in the right spot, it would have been unfixable... that said... good reception, decent display, etc. But the hinge nearly unhinged me."
5,ORESTIA-RIFFIC!,"Never before have I so resolutely leaped for literature.Upon my first reading, somewhere amidst the bearing of libationsI bounced from the couch clutching the spineand belted-out the mournings of Orestes as on stage.The masterwork is spellbinding;the masterpiece is spineclutching!Too, too cool for school!No single expression of creativity has moved this reader like this work has moved this reader.Unmatched forevermore.This must be read.A life without scylys is unsatisfactory & ugly.Note: Please, please keep this text far, far away from Hollywood's feeble and mollescent hands."
5,WHERE'S THE KINDLE EBOOK?,"When will ""The Greatest Story Ever Told "" be released on Kindle ebook? It is available on the nook but the scanning is atrocious. There are many words not spelled correctly. Come on Amazon .This is a book easly understood by people of all ages. It brings the bible to life"
5,Some of the greatest books I have read,"Fulton Oursler's triogy - The Greatest Book Ever Written, The Greatest Story Ever Told & The Greatest Faith Ever Known - where he retells the Old Testament and the New Testament in a very readable, narrative form, are some of the best books I have ever read. What a great insite into the story of Creation and Salvation."
3,Great Films BUT Dodge BoxSet,"Undoubtly 2 great films but this box-set looks and feels cheap, the cheapest dvd boxs were used, you know the ones that are really soft and flexible not the hard strong ones. Also the individual dvd covers look like they were slapped together in 2 minutes and are not very pleasing on the eye...If only the distributors had taken as much care in releasing this box set as Clint Eastwood did in makin these 2 great films........."
2,"I KNEW THIS WOULD BE OUT AND DIDN'T BUY ""FLAGS"" BECAUSE I EXPECTED IT","I knew they would first get you to buy ""Flags of our Fathers"", then come out with this package. For once I wasn't fooled by this clever marketing ploy and did not purchase ""Flags"". I'll purchase this box set when it comes out. Eastwood and company will be laughing all the way to the bank over all those people who purchase the films 3 or 4 times. Lucas, Speilberg, Eastwood? Forget their rhetoric, they are all in it to make money off of our backs. This time around they will only get me to purchase the film one time, for once."
1,desilusion,"la verdad uno espera mas de Marcela Serrano despues de haber leido sus libros anteriores. Estos cuentos no tienen nada que ver con sus anteriores novelas, que tanto disfrute. Para colmo, uno se siente estafado, solo 2 cuentos escritos en un tamano de fuente que se puede leer a 4 metros de distancia! son 94 paginas, pero que en realidad con un tamano de letra normal serian no mas de 20! y hay que pagar 13 dolares!Como asidua lectora de Marcela Serrano me senti realmente defraudada, sugerencia: quedense con la memoria de obras maestras como ""Para que no me olvides"" o esperen a que Marcela vuelva a sus habituales novelas."
4,Compassionate caring for our aged parent(s),Dr. Roots has shown a Christian insight into a dilemma of the baby-boom generation...that of how living longer is affecting our society. I strongly urge reading this book as it instills the sensitivity issue into our hearts while we may otherwise become over-stressed.
5,Yeah Yeah Yeahs* Maps,"Even though this CD is only of 4 songs, I needed to buy it after hearing those 4 songs. The first song, I can never stop listening to, and everytime I play it over and over again, it still seems as if I've listened to it the first time. 'Cause you know, that if you listen to a very good song that you absolutely love for the very first time, you fall in love with it instantly. I recommend that you buy all of Yeah Yeah Yeah's CD's and please do recognize the unbelievable talent the singer and band members have."
3,For clarification,"While another reviewer stated that there are no other versions of the song, he is incorrect. The above MP3 is a live recording of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs playing Maps. The reason it is 6 minutes long, rather than 3 is because the intro is extended while she thanks various people, etc. Once she gets into the song itself, it is a little more raw and not quite as smooth as the studio version."
2,Definitely not worth it.,"First off, the single is going for $11+ online and contains only 3 songs and a video while you can pick up the full-length album for $10 or less in most record stores.There are no special versions of ""Maps"" and the music video isn't even in that great of quality, so they really don't make the single worth it. And while it is nice to have the other two unreleased songs, they wreak of ""songs that didn't make the cut for the full length CD"". They're much more low key than all of the material on Fever to Tell and aren't exciting at all.You'd be much better off using the money to buy one of their full-length CDs."
1,Terrible,She is anorexic and ways about 100 pound more then the guysLyrics 0/10 Production 1/10 Overall 0.5/10
5,Abarth dreams,Fantastic book from a fantastic person. I have written to Mr Cosentino about FIAT for 15 years ago. Lots of great stuff to dream back to in this book. Buy this book!!!!!!!!!!
5,Ruthie rules!,"Ruthie is in the tradition of Little Lulu,Annie, and Krazy Kat, if you think of her as a girl. Funny, silly, deceptive and subversive, she's hard not to like if you can appreciate a complicated woman. You'll wish she was your childhood sweetheart, even when she's lying outright, making up the most childish nonsense, or just being Ruthie. Not as brilliant as Calvin and Hobbes, but One Big Happy will do."
3,Missing Guide,Reader beware ... the Kindle version of Volume 6 DOES NOT include the Guide to Proust. That was the main I bought this volume in advance because of the guide. Amazon has kindly credited me for the book.
4,Finale of the great 20th Century Novel,"By the time I reached this final volume of Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time"" I was exhausted. I had steadfastly followed the advice given in my college French Literature course: I would go into a quiet room with no distractions and loose myself in the beauty of the language and the images.I did find myself referring to this final volume frequently while reading the others. The ""Guide to Proust"" is a great tool for remaining focused and maintaining the unity of the work.While I am no scholar, I can say that I do appreciate Kilmartin's Translation. The language is beautiful and musical. As with any masterpiece, the original is beyond compare.""A la recherche du temps perdu"" begins with the word ""longtemps"" (""For a long time"") and ends several thousand pages later with the word ""temps"" (""Time""). How's that for unity!"
5,"Your time is regained, too.","Time Regained is the splendid payoff of Proust's plot development, so carefully built up over the course of thepreceding six volumes of his novel. It is here that it all comes together, and he integrates his concept of involuntary memory with time and creativity, demonstrating the joy of escapingthe coils of time to relive the past unencumbered by the accumulated intervening thoughts and feelings. This liberationenables creativity and suggests metaphors. He describes how this has inspired his vocation, his dedication to writing the book you have been reading, and hands to the reader the same gift of regaining time."
3,Dawn of War is okay....,It was decent in overall but unfortunately the author did not know or understand the background of the Alpha Legion so he made so rather basic mistakes in the story regarding them. Otherwise the story was good but nothing too great. A good way to kill some time.
5,Intelligence with Attitude,"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses. When a mind has been trained to blossom in this way, the greatest danger might be that it could be considered grandiose for daring to make such comments."
5,Best Dog Shampoo,This product has worked better for us on our dogs than any other. It leaves their coat silky shiny smooth.
1,I GREW OUT OF THIS A LONG TIME AGO,I use to like pokemon. Pokemon is ok but not the best. I would like this if it was in the subtiled version.
1,What a Lemon!,"I begin my review by saying that the Prague Festival Orchestra and Jack Lemmon did an excellent job recording Peter and the Wolf. However, The Toy Symphony left a lot to be desired. I could not listen to it because it was so terribly recorded. The recording had too much treble and I could not adjust my stereo equipment to compensate.I suggest you purchase the David Bowie narration of Peter and the Wolf. It was quality recording all the way through."
2,She's all wrong here,"I think Ms. Fleming is great in many operas. But here, she sounds just careless: she mumbles the text when singing piano, when singing forte she makes ugly changes to the low register (to pass them for expressiveness?), she breaks the line with unnecessary swells, she fills the whole thing with sugary portamenti and swoops (to pass them for sensuousness?). The figure of an elephant in a glass store came to my mind in almost every track. A pity that Thibaudet let himself get mixed in this. The power of money..."
4,Recon L.E.D. Third Brake Light Kit,"Recon 264122CL LED Third Brake Light Kit 1997-2003 Ford F150 & F250 LD & 2000-2004 Excursion - Clear LensThis brake light looks great, the L E Ds are super bright and extremely visible Day or night, the cargo lights seem brighter than the O.E.M. however I thought fitment on my F150 could have been just a little better."
1,Avoid,"I bought this a few months ago and they worked fine in the supplied Ultralast Charger for three times.After that. One battery died (voltage always 0.02) and the other stuck around 2.5V. I verified the charger was working, but the batteries were defective.Be warned that the company NAB refuses to even discuss this with me (it's only $10... jeez).Buy real lithium 123's for $1 instead of this garbage.DISAPPOINTED!"
1,For your safety stay away,"I bought the ""Frequently Bought Together"" link so that I could have 4 CR123A batteries. The charger arrived with the batteries in place. Charged for three hours, the green light never turned off so I put them in my flashlight and they did not work. I put the additional two batteries in the charger and two hours later they exploded, leaking all over my counter and the charger. I have sent them back for a refund. I am look at the Hi-Tech charger for about $55 but it comes with 4 batteries and a USB charging cable. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,These batteries are junk!,"I bought these a while ago thinking that they would be a great sustainable option for my LED headlamp. How wrong I was. The first use was fine, albeit short. After that they recharged halfway twice, and now they won't charge at all. Not worth the time or money."
1,D.O.A.,"Product arrived Dead On Arrival...Amazon will offer a full refund, of course, but spare yourself the hassle. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Great Sills,"Recorded in 1971 this finds Sills in the best voice possible..For Beverly Sills fans this recording is a definite must have.But I can't say the same for the rest of the cast..I find this recording so dull..Eileen Farrell a favorite of mine from the 60s doesn't sound theatrical enough. She sings the music OK but there is something, like excitement, missing...I can say the same for the rest of the cast...In the so called Tutor Trilogy this is the least effective opera.....For more of an interesting performance I think Verrett and Caballe have the edge."
1,MUITO DRAMA!,"Ela exagera no drama, no convence. Tente LA STUPENDA E LA DIVINA, as melhores(na voz e no drama)!"
3,Mayhem and revenge abound in Washington mystery,"""American sextet"" is less a mystery than a story of a jaded ""Washington Post"" reporter's elaborate plan at revenge, and higher fame. Jason Martin, the Post reporter, finds a naive, but attractive young woman named Dorothy Curtis to seduce six powerful men in Washington, and use the information they inadvertly provide to suit his ends. Soon, the conspiracy unravels, and Dorothy is found dead under a bridge known for suicides. This is where Fiona Fitzgerald comes in. Fiona is determined to learn the truth about Dorothy as her personal life goes to pieces due to her affair with the husband of a Congressial aide. Eventually, Fiona and Jason clash, and the American Sextet will do anything to cover up their connection with Dorothy. A bit tame nowaways, but this book was written pre-Gary Hart and pre-Clinton."
5,Before the D.C. days of Clinton,"As the name implies, there is a lot of sex in this book . . . and how! A daring book about political seduction on a grand scale. Written before the days of Clinton (surprisingly), this book is not for the skirmish and faint of heart. I loved it!"
2,"Beautifual scenery, but weird story","The scenery of the movie was really beautiful, but the story of was strange and the last few scenes in particular were a little hard to take."
2,?,When I saw the original reviews it appeared about rivalry between perfume makers in 17th century Paris. Instead it is abut a serial killer with no sense of reality.
4,Drew me in,"I didn't expect to like this movie. It was something my wife wanted to watch, and I figured i would spend the time tooling around the net on my laptop. It really drew me in almost immediatly. Very interesting idea and well filmed. The acting was pretty good as well. I would tell friends to check it out."
5,The story of a murderer,"I've read the book 'Perfume' by Patrick Suskind and was surprised at how well this adaptation was made. The visual imagery is amazing. This is the story of Jean-Baptiste Grunuis (Ben Whishaw), who has a super-human sense of smell but no natural body-odour of his own. He obsessively murders in order to capture the smell of women, whose scent he finds appealing, turning it into a perfume. The narrator, disturbingly, makes you sympathise with this cold-blooded killer and his twisted plan."
1,Stinky!!!,"Firstly, the movies is quite long, not so much quantitatively, but more in a sense that it is lacking in speech of any sort and goes directly to murderous actions a mere hour into the film without any real explanation of what the purpose of what our wasted two hours was. Therefore, I would have to not recommend viewing this film, ever. On a side note, Dustin Hoffman did a wonderful job portraying a washed-up man clinging to his past."
5,Beautifully Dark,"I was mesmerized by this film and recommend it to anyone looking for something different. The cast is exceptional, the storyline thickens consistently, and imagery is outstanding. The ending may have placed the movie in the love/hate dichotomy, but the whole movie is a fantastic journey in itself! Possibly occult-classic-worthy."
2,"The journey, meh, the ending bleh","The begining sounded as though we would be hearing a tale more upbeat, even with a murder. And honestly, I had higher hopes with Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman being in it. And I have heard from flutely-tuty reviewers of how highly 'scented' the movie was to break away from main stream hollywood. Bla bla, I love a great indie. I even like noir. This was noir-navore (carnavore,get it? lol) Ok, seriously, to me a movie lover, not a cult movie lover, I really didn't like it, sorry. What's a movie without an ending to reminisce? Can we really be expected to enjoy the last 'drops', and be told to enjoy it like the movie? To be seduced into a romantic version of why you really liked the movie, but were afraid to say it was crappy? The emperor and his clothes kind of thing? Yeah, save yourself those precious hours and find another movie."
2,Perfume unbottled,Full of stars but a very odd story. Slow moving start but it did pick up a bit towards the end. Not a movie you watch more than once.
1,"Epic, nauseating jumping of the shark","When this movie jumped the shark it was so bad it made the shark puke. I am still sick from watching this. I watched it for free on prime and dammit I still want that two hours back and my money back. Who can I sue for this blight on my memory? Dustin Hoffman, you chickenshit!! I sat thru this horrible filth because YOU were in it."
2,Perfume not our cup of tea,"This murder mystery was not one of our favorites--but we are not fans of period pieces. We didn't care for the dirty, gritty aspects of this period film. The ending was rather fanciful too."
2,disturbing,I have high expectation about this movie. However I felt so sick in my stomach half way through that I couldn't finish this movie. The movie itself is not overly bloody or anything. The imagination the movie created is just too disturbing.
1,Huge waste of time,"I chose this film based on its 4 star rating. ""Big mistake, huge."" It is slow, disturbing and frustrating. I had endured this film thinking it had to get better, that there would be some point or some reason for the story. Distressingly, there was none, ever. This is just another case of making a movie because one can be made. I'm surprised that such a high quality cast would produce such a lousy film, but it wouldn't be the first time. In addition to the pointlessness of the story/plot, it moved so slow. I fast forwarded through many scenes and didn't miss anything. My suggestion is if you're going to waste your time w/a movie or are sick in bed, there are many better movies (I'm sure) to occupy your time."
4,exquisite,"A hard film to categorize yet with an extraordinary appeal. Captivating throughout with occasional dark humor. Well acted with a superb script, unlike any other.Remarkable as the medium cannot convey the sensory dynamic, yet it is successfully communicated. The story evolves into Platonic fable: beauty can be pursued, never captured. Philosophical underpinnings really drive the drama.The conclusion is operatic in the best sense. A film to revisit."
4,Perfume-This scent worth every cent.,"Wow I loved this movie. But what does that mean to you? Well, If you enjoy mystery/suspense/horror type cinema with over the top endings you will love this one. The sets, colors , acting, music all were fantastic. If you like down to earth by the numbers movies forget it. A great movie."
3,Unique tale,"A unique story, very well acted with beautiful cinematography. A little long though. I was also a little underwhelmed with the ending, but I won't give that away here."
1,chilling reminder of human depravity,There is nothing redeeming in this movie. It is a chilling reminder of human depravity cloaked in a beautiful cinematography. Jeffrey Dahmer would rank this 5 stars. I wish I could recoup the time I invested.
2,Wasted Talent,"Clearly the talent in all aspects of production were first rate. I'm taken aback though. If one were going to produce a movie and have all of human history and story-telling-fantasy to choose a tale from..... why would one choose a lame, silly story to tell?"
1,Read the Book!,"Poorly cast, and unable to capture the power of scents nor the complexity of the story. Ughh. Read the novel!"
2,German Import Flawed,Why people give reviews on here for the film and not the blu ray is beyond me. Don't you morons understand we don't care what you think about the movie? This is a foreign blu ray review!!So I got Das Parfum the German Import of Perfume and the disc is flawed. 5 stars for the film but 2 stars or better yet 1 star for the disc. The video looks great but the audio and video are not synced together properly. The words do not line up with their mouth movements. The audio is a second off on the original English audio track. This ruins the German blu ray version. I am using the PS3 so my equipment is good. This is my only blu ray title where this problem occurs. Purchase at your own risk.
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER,"IF I BOUGHT THIS IT WOULD BE IN THE GARBAGE CANI COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS MOVIEDO NOT WATCH,THERE IS A ORGIE SEGMENT ON A LARGE SCALEWE LOVE PERIOD PIECES AND HAVE WATCH MANYTHIS ONE DISCUSSED USVALERIE"
1,Terrible Film!,"I couldn't get past the first five minutes before I shut it off. Being a mother, it was completely horrific to me to see a real baby being used to act out this part. Who lets their child be laid on a pile of fish guts naked and screaming for a movie?? The real kicker for me was when the children tried to suffocate the baby. I'm sorry, no. I don't want to see that in any movie - that truly is a nightmare for me! My mommy instincts kicked in and all I wanted to do was protect the baby, and it completely turned me off to anything else that might have been interesting or thought-provoking in the movie."
1,I'm not sure about Perfume...,"My friend went to see this movie in the cinema, and I heard this movie wasn't worth watching. Should I purchase Perfume or not, because I enjoy victorian drama. Andrew Ayton, from United Kingdom."
4,chilling but compelling,"Lavish, sensual, cynical - a very twisted morality tale. Much, much better than I expected - it was free, so I thought I'd watch! If you liked Barry Lyndon, you'll enjoy it."
4,Good Film,"This film is beautifully directed and is perfectly creepy. I especially loved, and was disgusted by the beginnings of our main character. The scenes are putrid and evoke a pitiful love for the young man abused by life. The interesting fashion in which he becomes a serial killer is almost sad. This film is a period piece that is beautiful and scary all at the same time."
1,"Waaaay too dark for me...I mean, WAY too dark.","This film should be released with a sternly worded warning about the graphic nature of the violence, particularly against women. It's a disturbing and overly long look inside the mind of an amoral young man with no guidance to develop any empathy.Bone-chilling with no relief for its entire length.I see no redeeming characteristics. I'm certain there will be those who disagree with this assessment but whoever does...well, I don't want to know them."
3,Silence of the Lambs with notes of Clockwork Orange and a twist of Oliver.,Silence of the Lambs with notes of Clockwork Orange and a twist of Oliver.A very different movie. You sort of feel like you need wash your mind with soap and water after watching it.Preferably a good smelling soap...
4,Perfume,I liked the scheme of it all.not sure about the ending. That was totally unespected. All in all it was a good movie.
2,Crazy,This movie was weird and very slow moving it was very hard to not turn it off . I would only recommend it just to see how strang it was
1,"Slow, and boring.","I ended up turning this film off. I chose it because of the cast and reviews, but it was slow, and quite boring."
1,Nasal Degeneration,This movie was so disgusting it was almost laughable. I got through about a third of the movie and I realized life is way too short to watch this obvious waste of talented actors. Someone was scraping the under side of the bottom of the barrel to come up with this olfactory train wreck.
2,Gets pretty weird at the end there...,"I was sort of into this film at first. It had an interesting premise and I love Alan Rickman so I really wanted to see this. I had read that some people really dug it and some couldn't stand it. Well, now I know why. It gets very bizaar at the end where I sort of looked at my husband and we had equal looks of 'what the heck is going on here'. It was all just very odd in a disturbing and ridiculous way. I think that ruined the film for me. I mean, it had a few things going for it, but then what happens hits you like a ton a bricks and it all feels like a wasted effort."
5,A masterpiece - dissect it yourself,"Devotedly accurate to the best-selling novel, Birkin, Eichinger and Tykwer have made the best film I can remember seeing. The music was written first and the film created around it as this was the prime way of evoking smell - but the use of building colour, absolutely stunning sets, costumes and cinematography, clever use of defining the tiniest of sounds and a stream of colour just enhances the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle(!). I didn't rate Alan Rickman until I saw this - two scenes in particular - work them out for yourself. Dustin Hoffman combines perfectly the sense of European history, dark and light humour, a huge range of emotions and gravity. Ben Wishawe is perfectly captivating! Buy this film, show it to your friends, children, parents or you may regret it. If you don't quite get the depth at first, watch it again, then keep it and as life reveals more of it's mystery, pain, love and beauty watch it again!"
5,"Very different, but very cool.","The title alone, drew me in. But the store kept me glued.I wasn't sure what to make of this at first, it is a bit slow paced for me. But I like how they took their time developing the guys character. It was absolutely VITAL to the story. So vital, that he turned out to be the hero rather than the villain. The acting was great in this movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I liked how everything that they shot made sense and it mattered. It had to be in the movie.I like movies that require a back story, I appreciate that. I would love to watch more imaginative movies like this in the future. Well done."
2,Not what I expected - I don't care this genre. My fault for not paying attention to what I was purchasing.,"Not what I expected - I don't care for this genre. My fault for not paying attention to what I was purchasing. I was attracted to the cast, which I usually enjoy but I couldn't get past the subject matter."
