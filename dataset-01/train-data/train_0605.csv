1,omg...,this movie sucked beyond all belief. props to their trailer editor and their personal trainers who managed to make this look like a potentially light and fun movie.
1,Worst Movie This Year,This was the worst movie I have seen this year. It has no character developement. The story line is weak and the acting by everyone stunk. Save you money.
3,Magic Mike,Sorry but I did not watch all of the movie. Maybe one day I will watch it bit it was slow
2,Wasted money on a dvd that was so dumb. Terrible story line.,I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. Everyone was talking about how great it was. I didn't like it at all.
2,"good dance scenes, poor plot",there's not enough story to keep this movie together. The guys are hot and the dance scenes are well choreographed but that's about all.
1,Watched this with 3 people,"We all came to the same conclusion. Horrible. Just a bad story line all around. If you're a woman and want to see these men strip, you might like it. Otherwise, horrible."
4,Lovely men!,The men in this movie are well worth the lack of storyline. I enjoyed that part of it for sure!
3,"Not my cup of tea, really","As they say, ""The world is going to hell in a hand basket."" A sordid story, at best. I guess I'm old fashioned."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","The story was extremely boring, the dialogue was dull, and the bodies were far from stripper great! Adam (Alex Pettyfer) didn't get enough air time and he was, by far, the sexiest man in the movie. I barely made it to the end of the movie and was glad when I did!"
3,The dancing was nice,I did enjoy the acrobatics of the guys when they were dancing.The movie had a poor story and it was quite boring. Magic Mike does have some well known actors. I think that they could of left out the drug use shown too. I was disappointed in the movie.
3,Should have been better.,Should of been so much more! The quality of the film sucked. Not the story but the actual quality is really bad. Alex is a marginal actor. Why was the old guy in the film? What a mess.
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!,Dance sequences were good but the storyline was thin thin thin!!! It just seemed to drag on forever. Wait until you can watch for free.
2,Dumbest movie EVER,This movie did absolutely nothing for me. I didn't expect it to be Oscar worthy but JESUS. I was bored out of my mind within the first 20 minutes of the movie. It's great there is a movie for ladies and gents who want to oogle over Channing Tatum's thrusting pelvis and six pack abs but this move is just plain DUMB.
3,"surprisingly disappointed, but your going to watch it any way","if your watching it for the eye candy its there, but you saw most of it in the previews. if your wanting a good story it follows the out line of every rom com you have ever watched. its good if your not expecting it to be the life altering movie, i wouldn't buy it but def worth the rental"
3,Channing Tatum was hot,But the story line abruptly ended. I thought that the ending could have been much better. They spent so long building up the story and then just ended it kind of dumb.
2,Disappointed!,"Watching Channing Tatum dance was the only good thing in this movie- the guy can move. Matthew Mcconaughey, although he's a good looking man & good actor- he came off as an idiot. Nothing was sexy or exciting about the movie & the storyline was just so dumb that it couldn't be taken seriously. It was a dissapointment!"
2,save your money,"Thin Plot line, Eye candy for the girls. For me the story line was weak. While the main character had some great moves I feel the whole movie was overrated ."
2,Boring,Ok so Channing Tatum is a good dancer...that's about it. The whole story line was pretty boring and the ending makes you wonder why you sat there so long thinking that the ending would be worth it.
3,Magic Mike - hilarious.,"So bad it's good. Just watch it. No surprise, no great acting, lots of the good parts shown in the trailer. Who cares! Enjoy life."
1,Big waste of time,"This movie isn't work watching. Although I love to look at gorgeous men and I'm a huge fan of Matt Bomer, this film was awful! There was barely any storyline and the way the movie was written they made it sound like all male dancers are drug addicts who sleep around a lot and use bad langauage. I personally know a male dancer and he's a sweet wonderful man and nothing like the guys in this movie. I hated all the drugs and bad langauage. I was hoping this movie had some romance in it but it was nothing about hot young sexy guys romancing. It was about hot young guys getting high on drugs, thinking they are the world's gift because they are young and hot and about them sleeping around a lot and I don't mean in a romantic way. I mean in a sleezy way."
3,Magic Mike,Magic MikeChanning TatumHow do I rate this product?It's okayMagic MikeChanning TatumHow do I rate this product?It's okay
2,Very Disappointing,"Never thought watching Channing Tatum would be so boring or seeing Matthew McConaughey in a thong would be a total turn off. I stopped and started this movie so many times getting up to wander into the kitchen or tend to who-knows-what, because this movie's plot just couldn't hold my attention or imagination. I finally turned it off for the night and willed myself to fast-forward through the remaining half-hour the next day. What a complete waste of time, talent, and money. If you want to see hot, greased-up, nearly-naked men in costume for two hours, then I strongly suggest you watch Gerard Butler and his boys in 300 instead. I wish I had."
3,What was the big deal?,"This movie got a lot of attention, but I'm not sure why. Channing Tatum's character was engaging and I was genuinely interested in his story. However, the ""Kid"" was a jerk and I didn't find him interesting at all.I guess that many women went for the ""dance"" numbers, but I wasn't impressed."
2,Boring,"I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve with 'Magic Mike' but it turns out to be neither fish nor fowl -- and watching Matthew McConaughey chew up the scenery got tedious very, very quickly."
1,Not what I thought.,"The previews were incredibly deceiving. They marketed this movie toward women, with promises of a romance-comedy with reversed male and female roles than the typical romance-comedies. It was a full-on drama, which i do not usually watch. I, as a woman, was also promised eye-candy. Not the case. Sure, there were beautiful bodied men dancing about, but the story line just felt forced therefore completely outweighing the fun of seeing Chippendale-like shows. I'm sorry, but once there is substance abuse, betrayal, and death...you lose the fun in it. I just don't know what the producers where thinking. I do not recommend it to my friends and i do not recommend it to you.ONLY WATCH if you have a firm understanding that it is a DRAMA, not a romance-comedy."
2,Poor story line,Okay so based on the fact that this is based on Channing Tatums life it makes the story kinda interesting. Not to mention all the scenes where they're dancing is amazing. However would I buy this? NO. The story line was really weak and boring. Lets just say no one would have seen it if it didn't have half naked men dancing!!!
3,Boring,"This movie was so boring. The guys looked great but definitely no story line. Ladies if you want to watch a ""no brainer"" movie this is it."
1,Ultraviolet is HORRIFIC! Give me a TRUE digital copy!,"Ultraviolet is the worst digital download imagineable. You can sync with itunes, requires a seperate app and weblogin to use. Basically, this digital download is an 8-track in an MP3 world. Digital download is worthless!"
1,Turned it off half way thru,"It was awful! We didn't even finish it. 20 minutes into I told my husband if it didn't pick up I wanted to shut it off.....well we did 30 minutes later. Boring as can be! Not funny at all. The main girl has no expression and talks and acts like Kristen Stewart(whom personally I find very boring as an actor/actress). Yes it had quite a bit of ""R rated"" material which really didn't bother me but now I have no curiosity whatsoever to go to a men's club. Don't waste your $4"
1,Waste of my damn time,"It was the most disgusting n darn good waste of time it was! Women are used as sex toys in this movie n there was absolutely no enjoyable part for me. I waited and waited and waited for some sort of part that wud help me understand why it was necessary to make such a movie but I can't think of any. If I can't get a refund, I shud be able to just delete this movie out of my instant videos list."
3,Not what I expected,Was home sick and had nothing to really watch and didn't want to read so I rented this movie. Not what I expected. Thought that some of the scenes just were not what I expected. Dancing was good though.
3,Woohoo... huh?,"Giving 3 stars because I got to see the film free after I purchased a copy for my aunt. The surprise in this film is how serious it gets. As a whole, Magic Mike falls short of ""magical"". There are many places the movie could've gone to make it really shine. In order to roll with the pitfalls and darksides which come with after hours work, one needs to care about the characters involved. None are fleshed out enough for you too. A watchable movie but not stellar. If you're just looking to stare at 6 pack abs and see some butt, this is for you! Otherwise prepare for a little heartache."
1,Disapointing,This movie defiantly did not live up to the hype. I was so excited to see this movie and it was such a let down. The only good part is they are topless.
2,Watch the preview... It is cheaper and you will be happier at the end.,"I wish I looked like Matthew McCaughey.Other than that, the rest of the movie was pointless. The story went nowhere until the last 30 minutes, then it was just over. Oh well... At least I didn't pay twenty bucks to see it in the theater."
2,Stupid,"No plot, nothing movie! There's nothing to tell its stupid movie. Matthew looks horrible. Tatum is the only cute part."
2,"the package and quality, along with time to receive were impeccable, movie itself major let down","After all the hype I had heard about the movie I was very excited to get the movie and have a girls night it, we all just felt it was all hype and no substance"
1,Not worth it !,"this movie is not what it was cracked up tone, Channing Tatum was cute, shallow story line. Not much else!glad I rented it , not purchased ."
2,Extra features were promised and not delivered!,"When I ordered this dvd I MADE SURE IT LISTED EXTENDED DANCES in the description. I gave it as a present BECAUSE of that feature. I only recently found out that it does not include the long version of the dance routines. The product features has been updated to the ""correct"" info, but I am very, very disappointed because I searched ALL the ordering options."
5,Absolutely amazing!!,"Love! Love! Love!! If you are looking for the perfect girls night out movie, this is it!! You will want to watch it over and over for the eye candy! :)"
3,"Hot guys, simple story","It was entertaining, but wouldn't say Academy Award contender. It was worth the time and the money. Anytime you can see a bunch of guys dancing to ""it's Raining Men"", is worth the time and effort."
4,I was really looking forward to this movie release,"I thought Channing Tatum was excellent and I never thought I'd say this, but one can only see so many strip routines in a movie before you have to ask ""where is the storyline????"" The back story was slow moving but overall it had a good ending. I'm giving it three out of the four stars for Channing Tatum's performance and body;) and one star for the plot. All of the guys danced really well!"
3,Tatum is Terrific,"Channing Tatum shows some great acting & dancing chops in this film, but the plot is fairly formulaic. Tatum is the next big thing who will take Matthew mcconaughey's stripper troupe to the next level. He recruits a sexy dope, Pettyfer, to the team....but soon he succumbs to the hedonistic pleasures of the stripper lifestyle. Pettyfer and his overprotective ( but not very good at it) sister, Cobb, weight the proceedings down with really, really bad acting.Worth the five bucks, but don't expect this one to perch atop your Best of 2012 list."
2,Girls night,"Bad script, but who cares. Channing Tatum bares all. Oliva munn shows way more than needed. They could have left her out. The dancing is great. If they didn't talk, it would be a great movie"
3,Entertaining,"I watched this movie because I love Channing Tatum. While it was fun to watch, there was not alot of substance to the plot. Sexy but somewhat lame."
4,"Sexy Guys, Good Plot Line",This movie was more than I expected. It had a couple good story lines going and was suspenseful while pleasing to the eye. ;)
3,bad streaming quality,I was unable to watch the entire movie due to poor streaming quality. I will bwe upgrading my internet soon and will see if it was an issue on my end or amazons.
2,Not a great movie,"This movie was not good. No real story behind, did not keep me intrested. Not the best acting. Just really bad movie"
2,Watch it with the sound off.,"The plot is pretty terrible, but let's face it...I'm watching this for the 20 minutes that Channing Tatum dances half naked."
3,Does Not Explain that regular DVD Version Does Not Have Complete Dance Routines,"I received my DVD version of ""Magic Mike"" today from Amazon.com. It does not contain the additional footage (dance sequences by Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer.) I was told today by someone that only the Blue Ray combo pac version has this. THIS IS NOT CLEAR IN ANY OF THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS PUT OUT BY AMAZON.COM. Shame on you Amazon, for deliberately misleading the public. Since I saw the film, I would not have purchased this DVD, but wanted to see the dance footage that Soderberg did not include in the film. I don't own a BLU RAY DVD player, by the way and can't afford one. I'm certainly disappointed that the Distribution Company distributed this product in this way."
4,Nuthin but Fun!,"IF YOU SAW THIS MOVIE AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE FUN THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU! WAS THE STORY LINE PREDICTABLE? yES IT WAS. WAS IT FILLED WITH PLOT TWISTS ONLY A MASTERMIND COULD HAVE IMAGINED? INDEED NOT. WHAT IT WAS.. WAS A REAL GOOD TIME. IT WAS MIND CANDY AND EYE CANDY THAT BEAT THE HELL OUT OF CHOCOLATE.I SAW MAGIC MIKE THIS SUMMER IN A LITTLE OLD THEATER IN THE LITTLE OLD TOWN OF KINGMON, AZ AT MID DAY. THE PLACE WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH WHITE HAIRED LITTLE OLD LADIES, MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND MYSELF BEING THE YOUNGEST BY FAR IN THE PLACE. IT WAS PRETTY QUIET AT FIRST, THEN SOMEONE LET OUT A WHISTLE AND THE PLACE ROCKED FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE.sEE IT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, YOUR GAY FRIENDS, JUST SEE IT WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO LET LOOSE AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN. I'M BUYING THE DVD AND WE ARE HAVING GIRLS NITE AT MY PLACE!"
3,Disappointing,"I like the actors in this movie, and had high hopes when it started. It just didn't utilize their talents well."
3,just OK,"Not my kind of flick but everyone else liked it so I was generous with the rating. Not much of a story line, just skin."
2,Nothing special!!,The movie was all talk no walk! I did not enjoy the movie at all. Dont waste your money! Pick something else!
3,My Wife Like It,"This was definitely a Chick Flick, but it was better than expected, from a male point of view. The plot was pretty thin, but it was still entertaining."
3,Made Hurricane Sandy go by faster!,"I rented this movie during hurricane Sandy, mostly because I wanted something to help keep my mind off the impending storm. It was cute, Channing did a good job showing us his previous skills and I couldn't help but think during some scenes his wife must be very happy!Don't watch this expecting a grand, deep, provocative movie, but rather something that's fun, light and with a side of buns.Ps. Matthew Mcconaughey although looked great, played a character I didn't care for."
2,Meh...,"I soooo wanted to like this movie. The story's been done before (Boy meets girl. The girl makes the boy see his future if he keeps playing hard. Hint: she's not in it. Boy leaves it all for the girl). This movie was so hyped up prior to it's theatrical release that I expected it to be a good movie. I didn't expect it to be award worthy, just entertaining. I couldn't even get into the sound track. It was eye candy for about 10 minutes once the story hit the club. After that it was predictable and boring. Skip it and watch Studio 54, or Boogie Nights again."
1,can't believe i watched the whole thing,"on a recent trip i watched rock of ages, which was totally panned by the reviewers. as a child of the 80's, i absolutely loved it so I thought I'd give Magic Mike a try, thinking it was of a similar venue and just maybe got a bad rap from the critics. BOY was I wrong..... just plain bad"
2,Poor storyline bad ending,Hate seeing good feeds unreturned in movie and frustrate you but ends poorly . Too graphic in some areas. Girl could have acted better and been better fit for main actor.
3,Predictable,"The first half of the movie was pretty entertaining, but then the story line became the typical predictable drama that one would expect with that sort of lifestyle. Too much drama, not enough fun. The movie was intended to be more about the dancers, but it ended up being more about drugs than anything else. Way to wreck a potentially good film!"
2,"a really underwhelming movie, im not sure how its popular.","yes Channing is good looking, not that u see that much of him, its not that well filmed, very amateur at times, i'm sure that what they are going for. very B grade stripping, once again part of the story but still doesn't make it very good to watch."
4,Entertaining,"If you're looking for something mindless to watch, than this is Worth renting. Channing tatum and Matthew Mcconaughey are enchanting...."
4,birthday gift,"bought for my mom for her birthday, did see it at the movies, its an ok movie.... i assume it will be delivered when specified"
2,Will I watch this again? No,"Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey are enjoyable, but this is not a good movie. When the plot takes them outside of the strip club, it's pretty dumb."
2,Storyline boring...,The quality of the video was underwhelming. Overall acting was decently good. It seems to be a storyline that has been done before--take out previous theme and replace with hot male strippers. Minus the men it would've been bland.
2,Acting very limited!,"I had hoped there would be some story with this movie, not happening!Not at all entertaining. Handsome guys with good bods!!!!!!"
5,CHANNING AS MIKE,This movie is every thing A Lady wants in a Man... But knows she will never have one in REAL LIFE... But To DREAM Of Channing Tatum and a few of the other men in the movie is well worth the watch...
1,Channing Tatum: Beautiful. Movie: Terrible. Left with a bad feeling.,"I went in knowing it would be:Men dancing.Men stripping.Ripped abs.What I didn't know:Drugs.Drama.Scary decisions.Matthew McConahay - terrible character.Sorry Channing Tatum,..next time hire a script doctor."
1,Mgic Mike,The funniest line in the whole movie occurred in the preview. This movie was not what the preview led viewers to believe.
3,"Okay story, good eye candy","I didn't see this at the theatre, but I heard some good reviews so I purchased it at a good sale price. The story is interesting but the real reason to watch this movie is to see these guys have fun and show off their assets. Take it for what it is, and get it for a great price."
4,Campy,"I bought this movie because I thought the dancing was phenomenal. Channing Tatum is an amazing dancer. There really wasn't a great story line here, but I don't think anyone would expect that anyway."
3,magic mike is overrated,"Okay, the guys are absolutely adorable, but the movie is way over talked about and way over rated. If the whole point of watching the movie is for the cute guys, then buy it. But if you truly want a movie with a good story line, then try a different movie."
4,Loved it!,It was great and funny! Really liked it. they did a great job with the acting and sexy men! woo hoo!
5,Magic Mike,I found this movie very entertaining! It kept me laughing throughout the entire movie. I especially enjoyed all the dancers and their perfomances.
1,Magic Mike - Less than Magical,"Like many other viewers I wanted to like this movie and thought it would be funny & amusing. It was neither. I wasn't expecting a great film but I wasn't expecting something this bad (lousy dialogue, mediocre acting, childish and sleazy plot)."
4,Entertaining and Fun,"I am not sure why anyone would watch this movie expecting an epic or classic.It is just a fun movie, with some good dancing, good music and a few laughs!Channing Tatum is definitely easy on the eyes and Matthew McConaughey's plays an excellent skanky, creepy strip club owner!If you are looking for some deep, thought provoking movie this surely is not for you, but lighten up and enjoy it for what it is!"
4,Surprised at How Much I Enjoyed This Movie,"Confession. I rented this movie to take a peek at Channing Tatum's physique, and mighty fine it is. However it caught me by surprise how much I enjoyed the movie. It has a sweet story line and the acting was top notch.Not a bad way to spend Friday evening--if you know what I mean ladies."
1,I walked out of the theater,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was absolutely horrifying and a drugged out stripper could of wrote a better story. I relied on the dancing to make up for the rest of the movie, but trust me it didn't. Just when you think things are going to get good (if you know what I mean) it skips to the next scene. I saw this movie for free and I can't imagine how angry I would be if I had to pay to watch this. Stay Away."
1,Worst Movie EVER,this has to go down as one of the worst movies of all time. Glad I didn't pay $8.00 at the movies--What was the PLOT????
3,Write Home?,The movie was okay but nothing I would write home about. It was too predictable with appearing to appeal to entice the viewer with more physical attributes of the actors rather than the acting ability.
2,Magic Mike,The bodies were good. The dancing was good. The acting was poor. Did not like Matthew McConaughey's role at all. He was a real sleeze. He is too good of and actor to play a role like that.
2,Magic Mike,I love Channing Tatum! I loved Dear John! That was a very good movie. Watched it several times. I liked The Vow. But Magic Mike was a huge disappointment.
4,Fun and so worth your time,"This was a fun movie,will it get an Oscar ummm no but if your looking for great looking men a time to just sit back and not have to think this has been done before and think again why cant anyone come up with something new then this is it.I went with other women but there were many men there also and we enjoyed the six packs,the tight rears and I have to say I wish they had showed more dancing then they did.I liked the story and I cant say enough it was just fun,will I be there to buy it OMG I will be right there so come on just watch and plan for a good time."
1,WORST ACTING/STORY EVER,"Acting was beyond awful.Not that I expected much but with all the hype and actors who have somewhat decent reputations I thought there might be some ""surprise"" to it..it was horrible! The story itself was lame,predictable,lame,slow,boring should I continue? But the acting...will give Channing Tatum credit considering his talent....he was the best actor in the film. Mathew gave his good""southern dude swagger"" same one he does in beef commercials and ...well everything else. The girl(?name) sister of Alix P character was possibly the worst acting ever...I thought there was something wrong with the streaming her timimng was so off...says something about the director there too..too bad I wasted $4 and a few hours of my life for this.How did this get so much press? Makes Ben Afflecs Gili look good"
2,"I was bored, sorry","I had been looking forward to watching this film because it received decent reviews and a good box office so I thought ""Hey, maybe it's good"" ... the dialogue was awful, the acting not much better. The only entertaining parts were the actual strip shows but everything in between was clunky and boring."
3,"good movie, not great.","this was a good movie,but not a great movie. my boy friend did not enjoy it though. thank you. j"
3,Well...I didn't watch it for the plotline.,"If you wanna see hot men take off their clothes and then somehow still manage to objectify women, here ya go. Matthew McConaughey was entertaining to watch if you enjoy seeing guys be extra, over the top creepy gross and mildly homoerotic. (I'm pretty sure they threw that in for a certain slice of the demographic sure to watch a movie about male strippers.) He even plays a bongo drum and tosses out a few ""All right, all right, all rights,"" for those of us who know his storied history.Overall, Magic Mike was cheesy, light on plot and writing and heavy on nasty...just as you'd expect."
4,My Wife's Eye Candy,"This is my wifes movie.. (I could look like that if I tried, ((LOL))..) Not the greatest movie, but not bad.."
2,Not his best work - has great abs tho,Thought this movie would have a little more story line to it. I love Matt's other movies and thought this would be something like them. I was disappointed.
4,Fun but....,"Again, a movie I am really glad I didn't go to the theater for. Nice flick for a girls evening at home."
3,it was ok but probably won't watch it again.,"Story line was too slow to really follow, not really worth it unless you are looking for some yummy eye candy"
3,Movie was good,This was entertaining. I thought it was OK but not a great movie. I would not watch this movie again.
3,Eh!,It was good that the dancers were portrayed as normal people with normal lives. But the main thing that kept me watching were those beautiful male bodies.
1,Sorry not for me,I really didn't know what this was going to be like when a friend told me I had to order it. It really was not for me...way too raunchy! I only watched a few minutes of it and then cut it in pieces.
2,Not Much,"Initially I avoided it when it first came out. I watched it with a girlfriend because we both had not seen it. Not much to the movie. I don't care for movies where men or women flaunt their stuff on the screen and in your face. I should have followed my gut feeling when I first heard about it. Oh, well."
1,totally sucked,"this movie was more hype than action, very slow in some parts and lacked story line. it was gambling on showing some male parts to desperate women willing to pay for it"
1,Pointless movie,"I knew this movie would be eye candy for girls but I was holding out hope that there might be a decent if somewhat cliche story. Yeah it was very predictable and you could see the plot points from a mile away but hey it had enough to be a serious movie.Ugh what a complete joke. The movie had no direction what so ever. Stories and characters that lead to nothing and have no resolution what so ever. It was a joke really. It's a pot of different ideas with no where to go or tie them together and it's all left unsolved. Almost like a rated R Chayote Ugly but with dudes. I think Strip tease might have a better story than this.So in other words. Unless your a girl, gay or a really really unlucky guy who got roped into seeing it by his evil wife/gf/friend then please avoid at all cost."
1,Not Happy with digital download!,Digital download can not be used with iTunes! Wish amazon would make this disclosure somewhere on the item listing.... now i'm stuck with the stupid thing since i refuse to use flixster! I will never buy another Ultraviolet copy again. AMAZON - YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR PRODUCT LISTING!!!!!!
1,Yuck!,"Is this a movie only for horny females or horny gay men? If you have a thing for men in banana hammocks, this is the movie for you. As for me, I couldn't wait for it to end, and nearly fell asleep on it. It was so bad that my daughter walked out of the room in the middle of it. I thought this movie was an embarrassment with a very thin, and boring, yet predictable, plot. I'm glad I had a credit to use to see this, but even with the credit, it was a waste of my time and money."
1,hard to watch,This movie has no story and its ponitless to watch. It's not worth 3.99 . i would not pay a penny to see it. i can't beleive amazon would put this up to rent.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"One of the worst movies, ever! Don't waste your time or money. Story is poor, writing even worse. Character development and engagement was also lacking."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"Never in my life had I walked out of a movie, until this one. Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen. Aside from the fact that it's a movie targeted are dryed up, horny, old women, the movie's plot and story was terrible. Some people I was with stuck around and finished watching it (dont know how they did it) and they filled me in on what I missed which was essentially nothing. Kid becomes a stripper, kid begins selling drugs and ruins his life, while Channing Tatum's character quits stripping. What a waste of money!!!!"
3,too much 'men for women only dance',"I thought: 'a different story'? Kool!But for my taste there are too much male stripper's dances. I got clearly the point about this (a bit particular) men's work after the second dance if not sooner, why insist on that?Mike is very good in dancing I guess (not a specialist here) the others I would say less.If you are tired of cops and conspiracy give it a try."
2,Not even good fluff.,Absolutely no context of value. I don't even think it was scintillating for the womenI watched it with. Extremely boring at best.
2,What is all the fuss about?,"My wife wanted to rent this film since she had heard nothing but good things about it. Once we were done watching it, I wanted the two hours of my life back. No realy plot, a lot of bare butts of the guys, plently of simulated sex acts on the stage.What is film making coming too?"
3,Good movie.,"This movie is okay, but has some unrealistic/improbable parts in the movie. Overall it is a good movie with some amazing dancing."
1,very bad playback quality,"it was awful. we watch amazon videos all of the time. pissed i didn't get a refund of the rental.the movie itself was fun...but couldn't watch it all at once (because it kept cutting out, i had to stop and start several times)"
1,Still not sure what this was about,"I rented this movie 90% for the eye candy. Sadly the other 10% ruined the 90% for me. This movie is dull. Terrible acting. And the storyline sucked. I get your brother involved with drugs by proxy and fall in love with you. So, sorry about your brother but you take me anyway. Mkay. What a waste of time. I want my 2 hours back. If you aren't offended by the language (which I expected some of but not as much as there was), and the terrible plot....if you can look past it, the eye candy is nice. But you see most of that in the trailer so just save yourself the time!"
1,"Video too dar,","This film was Not what I was expecting. Film is too dark.The story was ok, but very predictable. The cast was too greasy looking."
1,Terrible Movie,"Weak plot, even weaker scripting. All in all, the worst movie Ive see since Ishtar. Don't waste your time or money."
1,So Slow and Boring,when i first saw the preveiws I did not know if i was going to like it but after watching it I would never again watch it. The story line was so boring and i felt like they talked so slow to keep the movie going. I love Channing in Step up. But in this movie he was okay. I wish there was more than just the stripping because it seemed to be the only thing in the movie that had some action and nothing else.
3,okay but not great,"watching channing tatum take his clothes off of course is entertaining, but the plot just didnt make sense and seemed to drag on. and i thought the music quality could have been WAY better, it sounded like they were literally just playing it in the background while acting, i thought it could have sounded much better to make it more entertaining and engaging atleast"
3,Not great,"This movie was ok at best. It seemed like a movie with a low budget. If your wanting to see it, I would suggest rent not buy."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,Too dark. Not enough fun. Didn't expect it to be as serious as it was. COuld have done without the drugs and threesomes.
3,Not a Keeper,"Loved Channing Tatums body in this movie but as for the subject line? Mediocre. It was slow except for the club scenes...wish it had focused more on the ""behind the scenes"" look at a male strip club and the characters."
2,Magic NOT Mike,"I thought this was going to be far better then what it was, but in fact it actually bored me to the point where I started to nod off and fall asleep. There was just not enough of a storyline to hold my interest."
2,pretty faces not enough to make this likable,"i like most of the actors in the movie but their pretty faces and hot bods just wasn't enough. if there were part sthat made all the scenes flow together they were left on the cutting room floor. the dancing was, ofcourse the best part. the sister stayed grumpy until the last 5 minutes of the movie. the club owner should not have performed in the movie at all. everybody but the lead guy seemed liked an extra. that is really sad becuase we all know from their other shows that they can atleast read more than 5 lines each. i think tarzan didn't speak the whole movie."
2,magic mike,would not buy it. Bad movie!!!! Would not rent it again!!! One of the worst movies we have seen on Azamon!!
3,Magic Mike,"Must be my age but Nah not for me, on saying that my daughter raves over it, that is why she is getting it for Christmas."
2,Glad I did not pa movie theater price,Picture quality was very low over streaming as well..not that it would makup for the picture itself having no real story line and made me wish there was a fast forward button.
2,Not so magical,A movie that is advertised for the ladies...starts off with a sex scene that has a naked woman in bed and a topless woman. Then it goes to female strippers dancing in cages. Typical. I couldn't tell you what happened after the first 15 minutes because we shut it off. The acting was lame and the dancing wasn't enough to keep my attention or make it worth watching.
3,it was alright,the movie was only ok. the highlight of the movie was seeing channing tatum dance! it was interesting to hear how those who live in that world live. it reminded me of coyote ugly but in a guy's perspective. lol!
2,magic mike,"quality was great. Channing Tatum and his moves, awesome. if you add all his dance scenes up you probably get around 10 min of him and his stripper moves. story line and movie plot, horrible. matthew mcconaughey was more annoying then ever. 10 minutes of Channing and his stripper moves isn't enough to watch this movie ever again. one time viewing in my opinion."
2,Pretty bad,"I decided to rent this movie after several friends raved about it. First of all, I feel is was misbilled by the trailers which portrayed it to be funny and somewhat lighthearted. The storyline was choppy and disjointed and the content was much darker than I expected. All in all, Channing is pretty to look at but this movie is terrible."
2,Magic Mike movie,I choose two stars because this movie was predictable and badly acted. The only good thing was Channing Tatum's dancing.
3,Magic Mike,It was different. Good story line to it. A little to much cussing for me. Channing did an excekkent job of dancing in it . On the whole it was not to bad of a movie
1,Not up to standard,"Poor movie, not worth the money and I am I big fan of the star of the show, but a very disappointing movie, not worth $5.00 in my view, maybe $1 at Redbox if there is absolutely nothing else to watch. Really a surprising letdown."
1,"Very big fan of Channing, but this movie falls flat on its ass.","I have enjoyed just about every movie Channing has done, but this one is a total stink bomb. The movie just dragged on, coming in just under the 2 hour mark. The acting was really good, the story just wasn't there for a 2 hour movie, it would of probably still fell dragged out at 1hr & a 1/2, so to push out as far as they did was a very horrible decision. There were a few funny moments, mostly in the dances, but that is it. My advice is to rent this first to see if you like it or would even consider watching it again.Hope this helped."
3,Good for eye candy at the very least....,Meh. The movie never really had an ending. It was just over without tying up many of the story-lines.There's some time I'll never get back....
3,Same old story,"Same story as Saturday Night Fever, different dancing style. I was amazed at Channing's dancing skills and it was an interesting view of male strip clubs. But is it realistic? I couldn't tell you."
5,review,The disc came with no scratches. Also it looks like the picture. Kinda surprised that a movie with no plot would be entertaining.
4,Well done,"Well acted, well written, and the view wasn't too bad ;). I was suprised, thinking it would just be about how much nudity they could cram into the movie. While there was nidity, there was also substance and even a lesson to be learned. Overall, well worth watching."
5,What's not to love????,"The story was average at best, but the dance numbers were incredible! I wish there had been more since they were the most entertaining thing about the whole film."
3,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was the must boring movie I ever saw. You should have give us a FULL MONTY of channing Tatum just because we watched this stupid idiotic movie.
3,Meh,"It has a sweet love story and some hot guys. But other than that it was totally stupid. I wouldn't say its a ""must see""."
1,Down,Horrible movie! What in the word??? Guess we expected to have a good time with Matthew but even tho the wife liked his body it doesn't stand up to the young guys...
2,Stripper with a heart of gold only with dudes,"Typical story - totally predictable. Don't get me wrong, the guys look good, but it isn't going to win any oscars that's for sure."
1,Nope,I didn't care for this movie at all. I turned it off after about 30 minutes. Channing Tatum was so handsome but I just didn't like the movie.
3,"If all you want is to see Channing Tatum dance, this is your movie","If you are expecting the quality of a Steven Soderbergh film, it was was very disappointing. The plot was thin at best, the characters poorly developed. However, if you're looking for a movie filled with Channing Tatum and his very impressive dancing ability, that is exactly what you will get."
1,What a waist of time and money,"Not worth watching, absolutely no story line, total waist of good bodies. Unless you just want to see the hot bodies."
2,Weak story. Nothing to see here...,"unless you're just wanting to see guys dance crudely. If that's your thing, you'll love it. Otherwise, try something else."
2,Hated the story line,"The dancing was fantastic, but the story line stunk. This story line wasn't one that was believable. If you want more than beautiful bods, then don't buy this movie. You will be disappointed."
4,Good Chick Flick,I did not see this in the theater prior to ordering. I took the advise of friends who loved this movie. It is definitely a chick flick but entertaining non the less. Channing Tatum is believable in the lead. Mathew McCaunahey looks spectacular shirtless through the whole film! Women will love this and men will be totally bored.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I expected a fun movie full of hot guys, but i was a little disappointed in the serious nature of the movie. Still enjoyed the hot guys, but was hoping for a little more fun."
3,Fun,Great for an evening of no thinking and relaxing. Plot was a bit disjointed (no pun intended) of course the purpose didn't involve plot!
2,Very disappointed,"I've seen ""The Thunder Down Under"" and the ""Chippendales"" in years past and thought they were good dance reviews, and fun.I thought the movie was going to be fun and entertaining. There was little review dancing, a lot of single dancing (where I could tell there was a stand-in), a lot of crotch grabbing and the story was pretty sad.A much better movie is ""Dear John"", which could have turned dark in a number of places, but didn't. I was surprisingly pleased with THAT movie."
3,Eye candy,"If you're interested in a ""Girls Gone Wild"" eye candy film watch on. No plot, boring characters, but plenty of hot, ripped, sexy bods."
3,Decent,For being a straight married man this movie was decent. I felt some of the acting could of been better and I didn't like the ending at all. But over all it was ok
2,For Channing Tatum fans ...only!,"Seeing the trailer show I truly expected a bit more of the storyline. The strip scenes are mostly funny and (thank you, director!!) decent enough. The ""drug me so I can take this life"" topic has been knitted into the script nicely - the viewer never gets to misunderstand the life behind the facade and that quick money is not everything.To all the Channing fans: you'll enjoy it, cause the man has the smoothest moves and he can cry so lovely, you'll never doubt him.To everybody else: a ""can see"" but not a ""must see""."
2,No plot,So Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer (I'm sorry I'm not sure how to spell it) are super hot but seriously this film had absolutely no plot and I got really bored after like... 45 mins but the dancing made up for it.
3,"Muscle boys take drugs, have sex, get into trouble, then grow up","This movie is not awful, as some reviewers expressed. It is predictable following a typical Hollywood trajectory around self discovery and ending up with the good girl and a bright future. In fact, Matthew McConaughey does a pretty good job of acting as a nightclub owner, con-man, and ex-stripper. The stripper numbers are comic but fully of muscle boy eye-candy. Channing Tatum does a respectable job of acting and a surprising job as a dancer and stripper. Alex Pettyfer plays the innocent 19 year old construction worker whose eyes are opened to a world of sex and drugs by Magic Mike, the role played by Tatum. Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer played minor roles which was a bit disappointing. In the end, I would summarize by saying that this is a fairly predictable Hollywood production that is entertaining but not has no message other than everyone has to grow up some day."
2,rather boring,Nice eye candy but a very weak story line detracts from the experience. It was hard to give it much attention.
2,Not worth the money or time,Slow moving - predictable - even the mens great bodies couldn't save this one -don't waste your time and money
2,Not so good,"Kind of a stupid movie, I love the actors but this work is not their best. I would not recommend this movie."
3,Gotta Love Matthew!,"Matt C is always nice to watch. There is no real story or even interesting joke here but if you like male abs and a tiny bit of nudity, you'll get to see some."
3,Not too great.,A good movie to watch for the heck if it. Have a beer. No decent plot and not enough naked men dancing around in my opinion :)
2,Magic Mike,"For all the hype, not a particularly enjoyable movie. The plot line, if it exists, is slim. The acting not up to par. If what you want to see is a bit of male anatomy, it'll probably serve. But don't expect great entertainment."
3,Disappointed,Nice eye candy but lousy plot.........I was disappointed after all the promotion. Of course I still love Matthew and others
1,Really hard to watch,"It was hard to watch it was so bad. I skipped ahead and almost just stopped the whole thing. Wow, don't bother....Channing has a great body but this movie is not worth your time."
2,Not Worth The Money,This move seemed like it would be entertaining but ended up being a huge disappointment and was hard to follow the plot if it can even be considered to have one.
2,Movie is good but this version doesn't have extended scenes,The description on Amazon said this version has the extended dance scenes but it does not. I ended up having to buy another copy which cost more so I could get what I had been led to believe I was buying with this one. That's the last time I believe the description when there's supposed to be something extra in the least expensive version.
2,Yummy bodies,"I get it. It's a male dance club, but the story sucked. The acting sucked ( and I'm a big Matthew M. and Channing Tatum fan) but I didn't care for Matthew in this at all. And movies using the F word constantly really turn me off."
1,Glad I Didn't Buy It,"Attention Soderbergh: While women can appreciate hot bodies, that does not mean you can throw away everything else.I could only watch this movie to about the middle before I turned it off. I found myself wandering away to do other things, like checking to see if any dishes needed to be washed. Boring, boring, boring. I haven't seen such bad acting in a long time, and the whole movie seems to comprise a bunch of guys wandering around making up the script as they go along. The whole thing just drags. And the supposed love interest? She's the worst of the bunch. I hope she doesn't quit her day job, as Mike says at one point. I thought the dance sequences might be a saving grace, but they aren't. It really makes me wonder about the people who said this was a good movie. What a waste of film and talent."
3,As expected,Entertaining but nothing more than that. It is a good rental if you want to watch good looking men dance.
3,Entertaining,"Fun movie, had a little bit of everything for everyone - comedy, romance and action. The eye candy did not disappoint!"
2,Should I Watch It Again,By mistake I bought the download instead of the movie. It was very dark like a bootleg............is it worth watching again?
2,NOT SO MUCH,"It really wasn't what I expected, although I guess I should have expected what it was (smile). Glad I didn't take the time to go to the theater to see it."
3,Not so magic...,"Half naked guys:checkPlot:there was one?Yep, that's really all there is to this movie but I do own a copy for girls nights!"
2,I expected more,"I thought the movie will be better, also the dance performances were not that great, but I guess that's the risk of buy a movie that has not been premiered"
2,Mediocre with very little plot line,"This could've had more of a story line behind it. Why did they have an ugly girl as the main actress? It makes it a bit unbelievable with Channing in it but aside from that, I was trying to figure out how they ""fell in love"" by the very few times they even hung out!? It made it seem quite unrealistic and to be honest, I was hoping there was more to it than just his dancing."
3,If you got nothing better to do.,"Not the best movie but something to do to burn a couple hours, the plot lacked a lot had some funny lines but don't expect to much."
2,didn't find it to have any content,"typical stripper in florida story, but with men. neither my wife or i liked it. we found it depressing and were hoping for something light hearted."
2,"Wife: ""Previews were the best part of the film""",Not worth the money we spent. Wait until you can watch it for free. Acting was almost non-existent. Cannot recommend.
2,Mike Offer Little Magic,The storyline to this film was not only dated and trite but was devoid of any true dramatic conflict.A documentary about the formation of the Chippendales would have been far more inspiring.
2,Review,I am sure the ladies will relate to it but it is a high price to pay see Channing in a thong.
5,Love it!!,I love this movie!! I was so pleased to see with the purchase of the dvd for my mom I got this for free!! Awesome!
2,Week plot,"We heard this was good, but the acting is bad and so is the plot. Don't bother watching this one."
2,review,"didn't like it all, way over the top on whole stripper scene. Surely didn't like the way the love story went. Would not reccomend. Could and should have made as a comedy."
2,Male dancers in distress,"I was disappointed in the tale. I guess I'm of the age that the drug culture is not my bag. I know it exists, just a fratricide exists."
3,Magic Mike was okay but I lost interest fast.,The movie was just okay in my book. Sure Channing Tatum was nice to look at but a movie needs more than just sexy men. It needed a better story line or something. It was just lacking in my book. I lost interest fast.
2,Amateur,This movie should never have made it to the theaters! Acting was awful and amateur....Guys were decent to look at...
1,Not worth it,"Thought it would be beter. Although I was expecting it to be trashy, this was way more than that. If anything made it worth watching - it was Tautam's cuteness.I would have liked a little bit more of substance in the movie."
2,Not worth watching,There were far less dance scenes than I was anticipating. The plot was weak and the ending was atrocious. Everyone else who saw the movie with me felt like it was a waste of time.
2,Not for me!,I didn't care for it because there wasn't really a story line!!! The only thing it was about was stripping not enough about the person stripping!
3,GOOD TO WATCH FOR WOMEN,HAS THE TRADITIONAL LOVE AND ROMANCE . AS WELL AS THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY REALLY GOOD MOVERS IN IT NOT BAD
2,Disappointed,I was so looking forward to this movie and was so disappointed. There was no story line and I am no prude but I not understand why every other word out of any of the actors mouth was f___.
2,Disappointing,"I thought this movie was a big disappointment. Although there were some top-name actors in this, it seemed to be lackluster."
4,Magic Mike has all the right moves....,The character of Magic Mike was outstanding. He is a fabulous dancer and definitely played the role well. The plot of the story seemed to have gotten lost towards the end... It kind of left me hanging when it ended.
3,Alright but not as good as that British one,The guys were kind of clueless and it was hard to care about them. The dancing was good but it wasn't like I was routing for them like that British flim where they were all poor and had to learn how to dance.
2,I rented this one for my girlfriend.,"My girlfriend really loves the main character in this movie so i decided to be nice and rent it for her. Its not really that great of a date night movie. If you dont have a vagina, then it wont be a good movie at all. She seemed to like it, but i was miserable sitting through it."
2,Over hyped,I didn't think the book lived up to the hype it received on television and the story line wasn't that great.
4,she loves it,got this for my daughter for christmas I don't understand her wanting it the movie wasn't that good the dancing was great love Channing Really what's not to love.
1,Waste of Money,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't waste your money. There is no story line. Poorly done. What a waste.
1,Mathew can do better than this!,"Mathew has embaressed himself witht his picture! Can you say ""Give me the money""? We hope you start making better choices in your career, case we really like you most of the time."
1,Blah,Crap. Only nice thing was the hotness of the men. Acting was terrible and the plot was hard to understand. Also super boring.
1,Awful movie - not worth spending the time watching any of it.,Skip this one! The reviews lead me to believe it was good - so much for trusting reviewers. Worst movie in years.
4,Surprisingly good,"I watched it because it was recommended, but I wasn't expecting to like it. I figured it would be silly. But it was good! Entertaining, I actually liked the characters, and the lead is hot, hot, hot."
1,Sucks,"Absolutely stupid. Why didn't they just have the guys pose all thru it? That's all it was. Absolutely no plot whatsoever. Dumb, dumb, dumb...."
1,magic mike,"The movie has no real story line. My girlfriend who is a Matthew McConaughey freak, was even dissapointed in the movie. It was a waste of time and money to watch."
2,overated movie.,This movie had no story at all. I was looking forward to seeing Matt Bomer dance since he is so talented..never even saw his face...waste of money..I paid $3.99 for a foolish movie..
1,fast forward,"I was super excited to see this movie, it had all the guys I like. Boy was I dissapointed! Dumbest movie ive seen in a while. The plot was non existant. I was expecting more. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. If you don't want to take my word for it I advise you to rent it first."
1,Magic Mike,"I dont recommend this movie, sucked!!!! I lost all respect for the actors in this movie. I cant bring myself to watch anything that they are in."
2,Not as great as it was built up to be,Really lacked plot. Did not keep my interest for 2 hours...even though I love Channing Tatum and Matthew McConnaghey. Music wasn't that great either.
2,I expected more,"This movie disappointed. It had a semi-decent story line, but I expected more. Not more stripping, there was plenty of that. Not sure how it could have been done differently (except maybe a more exciting ending)."
1,"Horrible...absolutely horrible...no plot, no anything!",WORST movie I've seen in a long time. Ads indicate there might be some romance...nope...just 2 hours of raunchy stripping and drugs.
2,Not so magical,"I had really high hopes for this movie.I don't know why but I did.What a letdown.They show Tatum nude in the first 30 seconds and I wish I would have turned it off after that.The story was horrendous.See Mike and Co. strip.See Mike and Co. use drugs.See Mike and Co. do things that would have them HIV positive in a matter of minutes.UUGH.Boring, gross people doing boring and gross things.Two stars for Tatum and that's being generous.NOT recommended after the first one minute mark."
4,A surprisingly strong story,"I won't lie. I went to this movie for the sights. However the story was more developed then I expected. Mike is that guy. That guy who is down on his luck, screwed up his credit when he was younger, and still can't fix it. That's Mike. Now he's a stripper to try to fix his life. Along the way he takes on the Kid as a quazi-apprentice. Lots of laughs, definitely a movie for chick night with your friends."
2,NOT as good as the previews show,"If you order from Amazon Instant Video you can download it to your computer and watch it now, you dont have to wait until the 23rdDont get me wrong, its nice seeing Tatum Channing's chest and behind, and Im glad the movie has a story behind it, but it is NOT near as good as the previews make it out to be. Rent it before you buy it. Or you may end up severely disappointment and out of $15 just like me."
1,pure trash,pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash! Hated it! Not worth the money!
2,lacking,"Dance scenes were great, but the writing was terrible. It was enjoyable for about the first half hour, after that I was bored to tears. Had the story been written better, this movie would have been worth my while."
2,I'm a straight female and I literally hated this movie...,"So bad...the acting...the 'story' everything was just so so bad. The chemistry between Mike and his 'love' interest was non-existent. Although Channing Tatum did look like an acting rock star next to whoever that lady was. The ending was lacking...i'll just leave it at that. Another indicator that an actual story line was not important in this movie. Also the Matthew McConaughey strip scene at the end was soooo awkward, but to be fair I was praying the movie was over by that point, which thankfully it was, so it might not have been his fault. I was just cringing throughout the whole thing. I'm a female...I love hot naked guys, but I guess I need a little story time to go with it (Unless I am literally at a male strip club!!!) because Magic Mike was a disaster for me. Disaster......."
2,Really????,"This went from being a happy, fun, wish I could be there movie, to what the hell just happened movie..... Word of advise best to rent not to buy!!!!!"
2,Thank Jupiter I Did Not Pay $10 To See This!,"I watched this film expecting to scream my head off. After all, a few of my female co-workers stated, ""Everyone in the theater was screaming!""I was bored. Channing Tatum was in fine form. However, for some reason, I kept thinking about Chris Brown during his dance performances. The lead actress was terrible, and had absolutely no chemistry with Channing's character. I kept thinking, is this an actress fresh out of acting school.The dance scenes were too few. Alex Pettyfer played his role ok. Matthew McConaughey fulfilled his obligation looking spectacular I might add. The rest of the cast was under used.Would I recommend Magic Mike? Only if it was offered on Amazon Instant Video for 99 cents or free on Netflix. Hard to believe this film made over $100 million dollars. Women/Gays! We deserve better!P.S. The floppy bums on one of the dancers was quite laughable. Sorry Adam."
2,"Everybody raved, but....","Far from being naive or a prude, I still couldn't get over the sleaze factor. It is just plain icky in my book. That being said, Matthew McConaughey did a great job of being the king of sleaze as did the dancers. Just not into beefcake I guess."
3,Umm I have no clue way all the hype on this movie,Ok so Channing Tatum is HOT! Yes we know this. The dancing was great who doesn't like to watch a good strip show. But that was just it. The story line to me was dry there was no substance to this movie except for watching guys dancing around stripping. Which I do like eye candy so that is the only reason why I gave this 3 stars just because Channing Tatum is a great dancer in this movie but I look at him differently other than a stripper.
3,"Entertaining enough to rent, but not to buy","Can't argue with the visuals, but the plot went from fairly easy going and predictable to a strange 'let's create drama' twist that did not flow well with the movie."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"Somehow my friends raved about this movie and got me all excited. I watched it and found the story a little weird and quite dull. The dance scenes were like nothing I've seen before but they were randomly punctuated into the story and it didn't feel cohesive. Strangely, many of the scenes cut off the faces of the actors and just focused on their torsos, even when they were talking. Maybe there was some deeper meaning, but I couldn't get into it."
2,Not what I expected...,This was very different than I thought; I was expecting something lighthearted but became rather depressed. The acting is also terrible!
3,Bought as a gift,"I liked the movie enough to watch it once. I was actually disappointed that there wasn't more to see...if you know what I mean ;-)There was more dancing with clothes on than anything else. The ""nude"" scenes were short and few and far between. I just expected more stripping out of a movie about male strippers. :-("
1,No real plot,"Lousy movie, no plot. Glad I didn't buy this movie. Would rather watch Chippendales! Acting was horrible-ending predictable. Don't waste your time or money."
3,"The dancing is great, the story line is a little lame",It's entertaining and the perfect flick for a girls night at home. Definitely a chick flick! Enjoyable but may not be Oscar worthy. Ha Ha
3,Light and entertaining,The movie is nothing really special but I am a fan of Channing Tatum and love to watch him dance.
5,Magic Mike,"The guys are sooo HOT. It also has a good story line. Love the blueray format. Going to have a girl's nite so my friends can enjoy it, too. Thanks."
5,Great Movie!!!,I really enjoyed this movie :) and channing tatum did a great job and there were many great actors in the movie as well
4,A Little disapointing,"The dancing was great. Was not thrilled with the lighting, but very glad I bought it. Music was great too."
3,Streaming this video may not be the best way to go,"Although I liked this movie, as with all streaming videos there is a risk of refresh or buffering delays while you watch. This probably has as much to do with your level of cable speed as anything, but mine is top of the billing chart with Time-Warner and I still had issues with it. Until streaming improves, or you can purchase streamers for less than $10, I will probably buy the discs going forward for the extra $3."
2,boring,"I thought it would be fun to watch good-looking men dance, but the movie plot was boring. If you like Channing Tatum, don't waste your time or money."
3,Lovely eye candy,"What can I say, I didn't rent this for the story as it is mediocre at best. I wanted to see all of the beautiful men, especially Channing Tatum and is sexy dance moves and Matt Bomer, one of my all time favorite gay actors, just behind Ian McKellen and Ellen Degeneres :)"
2,Not very good!,"Although I usually enjoy Channing Tatum movies, the story and characterizations were poor. Very predictable. I would not recommend to others."
1,HAH Wife wasn't a fan,I had to work the weekend so I rented this to keep the wife entertained. She texted me as I was arriving at work and she said the movie wasn't for her with the gyrations and plodding plot. I didn't see it (I wanted to keep my man card) but as my wife is a huge Tatem fan (Did I spell that guy right?) Whatever. Her number 1 fan told me it was crap. Take her review for what it is worth.
4,Sexy movie,"This was a good movie, however, it wasn't long enough. IN other words, it needed more of a story line, but it was good."
5,MAGIC MIKE,"AWESOME, GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT SERVICE, IT DID COME A DAY LATE BUT IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT I LOVE IT."
5,love channing tatum!,"this movie was actually way over rated, but I love anything with channing tatum in it ! although matthew mcc0naugheys character was stupid!"
3,Okay Movie,"I found this movie a bit slow. I had a hard time getting into the movie. I think the guys were hot and the dancing really good, but the story line was kind of a snoozer for me!"
3,"Yep Channing Tatum is sexy but the movie is ""ehh""",If the only reason you're watching this is because of Channing Tatum and his bod....then go for it. Don't expect much else.
3,Mixed reviews,"I haven't seen the movie but have heard many different stories about it. I had heard that the storyline wasn't very good, but the dancing was incredible. I'm not a Channing Tatum fan, but when I saw the picture of Matthew Bomer, I was hooked. Then I heard that he did not have much screen time, so I decided not to see the movie. But I've still heard nothing bad about the dancing, so if that is what floats your boat, go for it. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,Boringly Predictable,I thought it booked bad when it came out then bought into the hype...should have listened to myself. Predictable and boring...
2,Sleeper,"Why on earth did Matthew M. even both with this film? He was such a sleeze bag. So unlike anything else he has ever done. All in all, the film was boring!"
2,Magic Mike,Pic quality was very bad. Movie was depressing. Nice to see men dancing around in skimpy clothes. But could not see picture very clear.
1,Embarrassing,"I would give this movie zero stars if I could. Wish I could get my money back. All the participants will try to bury their association with this movie on their résumés. Lame script, lame acting, poor continuity and absolutely pointless reason to exist. Embarrassing for all especially me. I can't even tell people not to watch it because I don't want anyone to know I spent 30"" trying to find a reason to continue watching."
3,nothing spectacular,it was an ok movie but I would not recommend to anyone..The plot was slow going ..the only thing that was good about it was the hot guys..which there where a couple..
3,Magic Mike Not So Magic,"This movie was a big disappointment given all the publicity it received when it premiered in the movie theaters months ago. The all star cast of dancers had little if any dialogue. There was never a complete dance routine for any of them. If anything, Matthew McConaughey was more interesting than Channing Tatum, as his dance routine stole the show. Who's idea was it to cast Kevin Nash as a dancer? I'm glad they kept him in the background as it was obvious that he couldn't dance. All in all, I should have rented this movie instead of purchasing it."
3,Great Dance Routines!,"But the script seems to have been written by an 8th grader. Don't get me wrong, I'd watch it again. The premise was good, the routines are great, but the words spoken are juvenile at best and most of the acting is shallow. But.... The bodies are HARD and guaranteed to please!!!!!! 5 STARS for the EYE CANDY! /\ _/\"
2,I like dancing!!!!,"OK, so I am old and not with it. I thought this was a 'dancing' movie, yes, guys, I'm not dead yet. But too much stupid story, not enough dancing. If the story was better....never mind, still not enough performing."
3,Boo! No bonus features,Good movie. However am I disappointed by the lack of bonus features and deleted dance scenes. It's nice getting movies early with digital release but with no extras I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick. And with this movie the short end of the stick is unacceptable and a shame.
2,Terrible Movie,"The acting and plot was absolutely terrible. Most of the men in it are pretty hot, so I enjoyed that :-)"
3,I would not have paid to see it,"It was ok, not the best movie, but really, everyone knows the purpose of the movie and its obvioiusly not the plot. This is exactly what everyone calls ""mommy porn"" and to be honest, other than Magic Mike meeting a girl, I could not even tell you what the movie was about, but I did like his dancing."
3,Just Okay,Movie was just okay. I wasn't able to get into the storyline. It got a little boring halfway through. Instant stream quality was great though.
5,Best Worst Movie Ever,"Bought this for a Holiday White Elephant gift, went over very well! Everything came on time and in original packaging! Very happy with my experience!"
3,"Fun to watch, but not the greatest movie..","I definitely enjoyed watching the movie, but the story line was kind of like a less-good version of Coyote Ugly. I would still watch it again because Channing Tatum looks very nice."
3,Baywatch had more depth!,"This movie wasn't as bad as I thought but there was some depth missing. All characters seem very superficial even though ""Mike"" and one or two other characters do not want to be as superficial as the others.The movie ends rather abruptly but that was good thing because it just wasn't going anywhere. There is no doubt that this movie could have been a lot better with the great line-up of actors.Nonetheless, the movie still managed to put some positive messages out there for the younger folks out there watching this and I think that it's worth watching at least once.As a guy, I prefer watching Baywatch but I understand the hype that was created by the ladies about this movie.....I really can't hate on guys who watch their figure and have some skill."
4,Funny and entertaining!,"A funny and entertaining movie. I was thinking my girlfriend would enjoy it more than I would, but we both liked it. Don't be affraid guys..."
2,Not A Fan,"I really did want to like the movie......but it was predictable, pathetic & not that entertaining. I didn't really like any of the characters in the movie. Maybe it was better on the big screen; if I were a little inebriated with my girlfriends. Sorry."
2,channing only good thing in the movie,"Horrible story line, just unwatchable except for Channing Tatum. Never watching this type of movie again, just a waste of time and money"
2,Can I get a refund?,"The guys stripping was great the story and dialogue was horrible. I really wanted to love this movie and was excited to see it, that quickly went away once the movie started. In other words Magic Mick has no magic"
2,magic mike,I thought the story line was boring and the movie too predictable. It did have some entertaining moments. I thought the woman who played the lead female role was the best thing about the movie.
3,Speechless...,"This was an interesting movie. I would say it was more geared to a younger watcher, rather than running on a treadmill. The dance moves/performed were great, but I would not watch again."
3,Pretty good,It was entertaining. Worth watching. Love Matt and Channing. Little long though. Could have cut out a bit of stuff.
3,Beef Cake City oh yeah oh yeah!,Chattem is smoking HOT. So worth it watching him. But also the other cast made it fun notwithstanding the corny predictable stupid trite plot. My Amazon live stream screwed up towards the end of the middle of the end of the movie and I wasn't even sorry. Because I think the stripping parts were over!
2,Overrated,The best parts of this movie are in the previews. I expected a better product and story. The storyline is very weak. Just a lot of beefcake!
3,meh,"There was pleanty of eye candy for people who like mens' bodies in this movie. For people who care at all about a plot, don't bother. I'm glad I was able to rent it from the convenience of my own home and watch it from my computer. It totally wouln't be worth buying the movie.Video quality wasn't super, but I didn't really care."
2,Mislead,The info said you could play the dance scenes back to back but I wasn't able to. Also the 2nd DVD did not work for me. Very misleading
3,Still a good deal,Probably expected a little more extended material. Glad I purchased it. Quality is as good as I expected it to be.
3,Where is the deleted scene with Matt Boemer?!!,"I had never seen Magic Mike and decided to wait for the dvd release. First and foremost, I got most of what I expected- lots of eye candy and performances with no oscar nods. However, i was reading about a deleted scene with Matt Boemer as a Ken doll and hoped that it would be included with the film- not so. I think this film could have had a blast with compiling features along with the movie. What a shame. Matt is worth the extra film time."
2,Not Channing's best movie,I know. I rented this thinking there might be a story line. The first 30 minutes are ok. The dancing gets old. Same stuff over and over. I wouldn't watch it again
3,Eh,"Ok, so let me just start by saying that as I was watching this movie, I did enjoy it. As most everyone has said, the dance scenes were pretty entertaining. When the movie was over, I was like, ok, that was nothing special but not a horrible way to spend an evening. But as I thought about it the next day I realized that the story was actually pretty horrible and not thought out at all. I thought Channing Tatum did a decent enough job with what he had, but his character could have had so much more depth. Both The kid and Matthew McConaughey's characters were one dimensional and pretty terrible. There were a lot of scenes that really didn't add anything to the plot. Sooooo...good for one viewing maybe. Glad I waited for this one to come out on DVD."
1,Worst Movie/Lost,"OMG this movie started pretty good a bit of class then it was like someone got an amateur crew and just whisked something together . The film lost anything professional about it, no plot, acting sucked, camera and cut was awful. I don't know how anyone could like this movie. The ending wasn't an ending ha-ha. We forwarded to the end because we rented it and wanted to see if they could make it any worse. They did. Don't see it not worth it at all.Personally I think they all went on a bender and just didn't give a hoot."
2,"Hot bodies, bad acting","Aside from all the incredibly hot men, this movie was horribly corny. Most of the acting was terrible and the plot was almost nonexistant."
3,"ok movie, nothing I would want to own...",Entertaining. The story line was kind of there but it's mainly focused on male stripping...Channing Tatum is HOT so worth the watch for fans of his...
2,boring...tedious,This movie was dull and forced. The only reason to see it is to ogle Channing Tatum and to see familiar sites in Tampa Bay...Glad I used a free credit and didn't have to pay for this drivel
3,Cut so many ot the F word,"So,so, might have been more acceptable without so much of the F word. No prude, I have been known to use it on occasion, but not in just about every sentence."
4,Magic Mike,"Entertaining movie for gals, but compelling story for all about the world of male strippers with a standout performance by Matthew McConaughey"
1,Language,"The language was too raunchy for me, could have been done without the dirty talk. The story was weak, also."
5,One of my Favorites by Far,This is an awesome movie. I love having a girls night in just to watch this movie and get together with some of my girlfriends. Very well put together and very entertaining!
1,Positively atrocious,"Yes, I was bored and this seemed the best of the crappy choices on On Demand. Even with that very low expectation, I was let down. In fact, I turned it off 10 minutes before it ended because I realized just how little I cared about any of it.Pros: Beefcake is nice for a few minutesCons: everything else: story line (hahahha, as if one were there!), acting (Channing Tatum aside, he did fine with a crap script) especially the woman who played Adam's sister (bad bad bad acting) and the grossness of Matthew McConaughey's character.I was pretty sure it was my old age (52) that made me recoil from the ""sexy"" scenes (I was thisclose to yelling ""Hey you strippers! Get off my lawn!"") but I see by reading the reviews that age didn't factor into it much.How and why this even got made in the first place, how and why it even made money at the box office and how and why I decided to PAY to rent it are unsolved mysteries for the ages."
1,Disgusting,"Aside from some cute guys pulling of some cool dance moves, there was nothing enjoyable about this movie. A cast of dysfunctional characters, drugs, and random disgusting sex is not my idea of a fun time. Clearly, this movie was made BY men who only THINK they know what women want. Take the costumes for example: just because guys think girls in thongs are hot, doesn't mean the reverse is true.Sadly, the men who made this movie think women are as obsessed with their p-e-n-i-s-e-s as they are. Jiggling and grabbing their junk made up most of the dance moves that needed to wow us gals.With all the irresponsible drugs and sex, I kept thinking ""HIV, hepatitis, herpes alert!."" Simply put: it was disgusting."
4,magic mike dissapoints,"athough i enjoyed seeing channing tatum in any movie, i expected there to be more of a story to it. it was great to see the male dancers perform, but i wished the script would be more involved in a good story to add to the dancing. the performers were great but the story was weak to hold your intrest for long. if channing tatum wasnt carrying the movie, it wouldnt have survived."
3,WOWZERS!,"rent this movie for the beefcake, not the story line! I really enjoyed WATCHING this movie. These boys are so hot!"
4,Yummy!,"The story line and movie were so so, but I would watch again! LOL!I enjoyed watching the dancing.The music was good as well."
4,"A ""me"" time kind of film",I had been waiting to watch this film as soon as it was available. I enjoyed it. I wish there were more dance scenes and for me I could have done without the serious drug storyline. I had no idea. I guess I wanted it to be a little lighter
4,"Good, but not quite Great.","I'd been looking forward to this movie since I first saw previews before it came out on the big screen. I'm glad that I waited to watch it without having to pay box office prices.Like I said, it was decent. Not the best though. I think it fell short of its hype. I'd heard that it was supposed to be sexy but it was mediocre in that department. If you like Channing Tatum, it's worth a watch, though I wouldn't if you're solely interested in watching Matthew McConaughey as he isn't as huge as he could be in the movie."
1,not the movie i was expecting...,"I chosed this movie first because obviously i wanted to see this men dancing and stripping! Ok if isthat the only thing that you wanna see, but in general the movie has not story, no sence, no music no nothinh! The best part and the only worth it part of it is when they are dancing..."
1,How low can you go Matthew,He is a much better actor than this. He must have needed the money cause there was no plot and no story
4,DVD,"My daughters and I really enjoyed this dvd. It arrived in a timely manner as expected. It was in good condition, but after watching it the first time it now doesn't work right. It pauses and skips."
1,Started funny but a terrible movie.,"The movie started out funny, but just never got better. Not worth renting. The ending was just plain bad. Channing Tatum was funny and his dancing and stripping was hilarious."
5,"Just what I expected, and cost less than walmart...","Cost was great..packageing was great, delivery was, don't remember. I have a problem with the way the companies are packing the movies, I want a Blu-Ray, not a dvd, why do I have to pay for both, I would buy a whole lot more Blu's if I could get just the blu instead a package deal that I don't want or need.. Sincerely"
1,Worst movie ever,This piece of garbage was worse than Showgirls. I don't see why people liked it. There wasn't even that much flesh. Horrible waste of my time.
3,Movie was not as hype as it was supposed to be.,"This movie was a huge disappointment of the acting and role of Matthew McConahauy. Tatum, was great acting along with some other actors, but overall it was not the greatest movie like I was hoping for."
3,"Bluray quality good, ho-hum movie",okay. so this was a guilty pleasure purchase.I didn't see the film in the theatre as it sounded badbut the reviews for this film made it sound better than it actually is.Not that it's a terrible film.if you buy this for eye candy then you will be disappointing.
1,what a waist of time and money,"We were ready for a good time movie but this is just further proof of the ""dumming down"" of America"
3,So So Movie,The movie wasn't good and it wasn't bad. If you are into hot guys dancing with very little real story then you will love this movie. If you are looking for a hard hitting view of the male stripper world then you probably should look elsewhere.
3,Wait for it to come out on TV,"The plot was weak, the men were sexy, feels like I've seen the movie before different title, except it was women."
1,not happy,"great looking bodies but the whole movie stunk.I am not a prude but I think this movie could have been better with the two stars they had in it,"
3,Sure,"It was a good movie, fine. But I was promised genitals and I was gravely disappointed. There will be no showing of Tatum's taint here."
5,Love Channing!!,"Very entertaining!!!!!!!!! Good story, great characters, Great dancing! Channing and Mathew need to do more movies together. Highly recommend this movie"
3,Magic Mike,"Eh, okay movie was hoping for more of Matthew - Would still recommend to ALL! Thanks Amazon for a great site and the total ease of purchasing videos. I have to admit though that EVERY time we pause a movie it gets locked up and there is a major delay. Please fix this issue. Thanks much!"
3,OK,"It was okay for what it was, I definetly was entertained if nothing else while watching and the guys weren't bad to watch!"
1,Magicless Mike,"Boring and couldn't wait for it to be over. Dancing was good, but that was it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!"
1,Terrible movie,"This was less than a B movie. The acting was terrible and the characters were in-interesting. Sounded like it coud be a bit of fun, but I couldn't even waste my time to watch the whole thing."
2,Matthew McConaughey: NO! Channing Tatum: YES!,"Crappy movie: bad acting, poor writing, horrible cinematography, lousy lighting. Matthew McConaughey plays a skinny, creapy, drug-crazed bisexual master of ceremonies, and Channing Tatum plays a character very similar except that he's buff and can dance unbelievably. Every actor and actress in the movie could use some acting lessons. I would have turned the movie off much sooner than I did were it not for the occassional glimpse at Channing's bare rear end. The whole movie reminded me of a bad all-male-review in a cheesy drag bar."
2,MAGIC MIKE,"Had hoped for more as far as plot and acting, Found it a bit boring and not into it. The guys did well but not my cup of tea. Almost embarrassing at times for such reputable actors."
2,Meh...,"Yes, you get to see some gorgeous men with their shirts off, but the story is boring and the acting is bad."
4,Just ok,It was ok. Very predictable and slow at times. The acting was decent. Dancing was good. Burlesque was much better.
3,Cute and Sexy!,It was pretty much what I expected. Decent plot; nice backsides. Channing has moves that will make you want to hit Rewind again and again.
3,"Good, but not great","The movie had a pretty good natural flow with the story line, but lost some steam towards the end. The ending could have been written much better without changing too much dialog where the ending would have flowed with the rest of the movie."
2,Laurie's review,"It was entertaining.....but lacked in the writing. I would recommend it for watching it home, but glad I didn't see it in the movies. Wish the romance part was more apart of it then all the dancing?"
3,Chests but no content,"This movie was disappointing. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed to CHESTs and dancing! Not sure what I expected... so maybe it was my own fault for ASSUMING there would be more to the movie.:)"
3,Magic Mike,"It wasn't as great as all the hype. Nothing I would have to watch again. This is just my opinion, you might love it but I didn't"
3,Dancing Was Excellent; Plot Could Have Been Better,The dancing and choreography were great. The plot could have used some more work.A good movie to watch if you want something to play in the background or dont necessarily need to focus exclusively on the TV.The dancing and shirtless guys were fun.
2,Boring plot,"Boring plot line. I think that they expected the shirtless guys to carry the movie, but it didn't. I would skip seeing this one."
1,Majic Mike,I tried to stream this movie off Amazon but It wouldn't play.... But it showed I got a refund so its all good! &#10084;
2,Not good,"I didn't see the movie in theaters but I heard all the hype and thought it would be worth renting. Boy was I wrong! The plot was horrible!! The dancing wasn't too bad, but I thought there should have been more for a movie about dancing."
3,Uhh.,"If you're a single woman, then it's great. I watched it with my girlfriend because her [single] friend said she liked it. Both of us thought it was mediocre."
3,not much to see,"It was ok, there was not much there to see. The usual movie for teenagers, I didn't have anything to do an didn't want to use my brains."
3,Even my wife was disappointed,"Ladies will watch this movie to see mostly naked guys. Guys will watch this movie to make their wife or girlfriend happy. Otherwise, there isn't much reason to see this one. No real plot to speak of and the acting was lame as well.The part my wife liked the most was that Channing Tatum actually did all of the dance scenes, no doubles. Apparently he was a dancer (of sorts) prior to breaking through in the movie business."
2,Predictable Train wreck,Real slow in developing the main and supporting actors. The end seemed to be a rip off of Saturday Night Fever.
2,Disappointed in Magic Mike,"Trailers for Magic Mike made it seem like a comedy...in reality, not so much. Therefore I was disappointed in the serious turn it took."
2,my wife made me watch it,"With great shame, I admit to watching this flick. It's pretty lame but if it makes your wife happy, it's worth an extra star. It features the typical over acting by Matthew McConaughey. Olivia Munn is surprisingly good, however, and makes it a more bearable flick. Tatum is Tatum and does a pretty good job. If you liked him in Dear John, you'll probably like this, but it's not as good. Yes, my wife made me watch that too :)"
2,Blah,"I down loaded this from Amazon Prime, it kept cutting out. The movie sucked so bad that I didn't care too much."
2,Overall boring,"after a few scenes, seemed like oh boy another stripper dance number. first or second was likeyeah they are doing a good job this is probably like you would see in a male or gay bar. Just too manynumbers not enough story. Sure the ladies will give it 10 stars just because of the almost nudedance numbers but found it boring here."
1,Awful!!,I thought this movie would be somewhat entertaining but no plot whatsoever and no ending. Just a thrown together movie with some stripping. And in my opinion none of the men were attractive the only good thing about the movie was Channing tatum dance moves. Just bad!!
2,Not a good movie!,I was hoping for a polt or some decent acting. Quite disappointed. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
3,Magic Mike,"This was a gift for a friend, I myself didnt care for it, and so it goes. She really wanted this movie,"
1,Truly awful,One of the worst movies I've ever tried to watch. Complete waste of time. Would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"Terrible movie,","the acting was awful, I couldn't even finish the movie. Bad! and very bad. would not expect it to be that bad"
1,Eeeewwww,Dumbest movie i have ever seen; not even the barely clad bodies are worth the money. All I can say is purchase at your own risk.
1,This has to be. . . . .,the worst movie I have ever seen! The story is predictable. The acting is terrible. Half of the movie looks like it was shot on a home video camera. Do not buy it!
1,magic mike,Save your money. Not funny. Not sexy. Tired story line. Shallow idea with shallow characters. It should have been better with the cast available.
3,Man candy,"This was an entertaining film overall. The most fun part was watching the guys dance. The dance themes were creative and the men were good dancers. The story line was OK but a little thin and there wasn't a lot of character development. Overall it has entertainment value, especially if you don't want to think too much."
3,Not as good as reviews,"Dancing was excellent. The female lead was VERY dull, plain and just boring. Chatum Tanning was a great actor and dancer in this movie but even his acting and dancing abilities to not make up for the bad acting of the female lead."
1,Bad.,"I read the reviews and knew there wasn't going to be much to this movie, but a lot of reviews indicated it was a 'fun time' and 'eye candy' was good. Even going in with low expectations this move was a let down."
2,product damaged!,"The dvd case was cracked in the corner but played just fine, but the dvd was shipped very fast ."
3,Regular DVD does not include deleted scenes,"The regular DVD does not contain the additional footage (Dance sequences by Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer). I was told today by someone that only the Blue Ray combo pack version has this. THIS IS NOT CLEAR IN ANY OF THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS PUT OUT BY AMAZON.COM. Since I saw the film in the theatre, I would not have purchased this DVD, but I wanted to see the dance footage that Soderbergh did not include in the film."
1,MAGIC MIKE,WATCH ABOUT 20 OF THE MOVE AND THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED X NOT R. DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE CHANNING TATUM
2,Thumbs Down!,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie & I almost turned it off about 1/3 of the way through. The ONLY reason I kept watching is because I paid for it & because of the handsome men! The acting is terrible, the story is terrible. Don't waste your time. It's not even funny. Thumbs down!"
3,Nice eye candy but lacking a bit on the story.,"I'll admit, I bought it for the eye candy and was glad I wasn't expecting anything more out of it. Good for a pick-me-up on a cold winters' night."
2,Despite the great eye candy -- it was just not worth it,"This story line was just so horrible, and the leading actress so incredibly awful, that even my boy Matthew McConauhey could not save the day. There are so many more interesting plot line options they could have used in this movie. Channing is such a cutie though."
5,Excellent,This movie was in great condition when I received it and really enjoyed watching the movie. Channung Tatum is so hot and this was an awesome way of showing him off.
3,OK,The movie was ok. Sexy men but the story line was not that great. I wish the love connection was more believable.
1,Could not be worse,This was a terrible movie. The acting was awful. Could not figure out what plot they were going with just bad
2,Wasn't expecting it to be so depressing.,"Hey the dancing was great, but the storyline was a lot more depressing than the trailer made it seem. I would give it 2.5 stars because I did like parts of it, but it didn't keep my attention."
2,Good quality bad movie,The only good thing about this movie and the half naked men. The plot is terrible and boring. I didn't expect much from this movie but it was worse than I even thought it could be
2,Magic Mike was a disappointment,Magic Mike has very boring plot. The dancing by the men was great. I guess I really didn't hate it. That's why I gave it 2 stars
3,About what one would expect,"While not a excellent movie, there is an edginess that goes far towards the storyline. Enjoyable as an afternoon matinee."
2,Boring...,Channing Tatum is good looking but have yet to see a movie where he has any acting skills. Zero chemistry in the movie with the entire cast. The only perk to the movie was Alex Pettyfur.
2,Dissapointed!,"I gave it 2 stars because it didn't have a good story line and the ending was very lack luster..Didn't like Matthew Mc. role in movie, not typical of him."
3,Bad plot,"Not a great plot but an entertaining movie... I did not like the way the movie it ended, it seemed like there should have been more to the ending."
2,No special features!,"I was very disappointed because I was really excited for the extended scenes and special features. However, the DVD does not have ANY of that! Apparently only the BluRay comes with that, but it is not advertised anywhere that this is the case. Wasted my money on a movie I've already seen."
3,"Acting wasn't all that great, but the dancing was cool",The story line was okay. Acting could have been better. The dance scenes were the only thing keeping me interested in the movie.
1,Don't waste your time,"What a bore! I thought I was back in 1980! Plenty of hard bodies if that's all your looking for, but otherwise, don't waste your time!"
1,awful,"thin story, characters were not engaging at all. What was the well known director doing taking up this empty and unsatisfying story? The characters were entirely predictable. Useless waste of money and flim."
4,Great Movie,I am happy that it left a lot of scenes to the imagination. I just wish the ending had been extended a little longer.
2,DISAPPOINTING.,I have seen Channing Tatum dance before in another film and he was awesome. His moves in real dancing is second to none. This was just too much F language and gyrating rather than dancing. The storyline was only fair. Rather depressing.
2,Stinks,"I thought the plot and acting was that of a ""B"" grade movie. The audio was terrible and without closed caption we could not understand what was being saild and needed to increase and decrease the volume. If all Amazon movies do not have closed caption capability, we will not be watching any more movies on Amazon.com."
2,Nothing going for it except sexy almost naked me.,"Other than sexy, almost naked men, there was nothin impressive about this movie. The plot was un-exciting and slow and rather predictable. The whole movie seemed like more of an excuses to see almost naked men and lots of tits."
5,Great fun for a girls night!,"This movie is fun for all the girls in your life. Great dance scenes and cute men to look at. I definitely recommend it for those who enjoy good, clean fun!"
1,"run a way,","the story suck, I got roped in to watch this movie by a girlfriend. It was more for her than anything else. we did not even watch the half of the movie."
3,Fair,"The men dancing were gorgeous, but it wasn't much of a story and had too much moralizing to make it a good movie."
2,No story,The only thing I liked about the movie was Channing Tatum and his dancing. It had poor acting and Matthew McConaughey was kind of scary!
2,not up to the hype,I didn't get all the big build up. I get it was Channing Tatums life and all that but I don't think I'd share if it was the way I started my movie career. It's OK for a night with the chicks but to sit by yourself and wishing for something more than eye candy it was lacking.
2,I would have given it 1 star...,"I'm not a Cha-tum fan, sorry. The movie/plot just didn't do it for me and I'm the typical female who loooves things like 300 Abs ( I mean Gerard Butler in 300) and such, but this was just bleh. The ONLY decent thing was Channing Tatum's dancing skills. Everyone else bored me to death. It got really monotonous after 15 minutes...AND predictable. Unless you're a big Tatum fan, don't buy it, let alone see it!"
2,dont like the movie,"Even though I love Matthew,I was kind of disappointed in the movie itself.I know others will enjoy it,but I did not"
5,geat viewing,we love this video and enjoy watching it. thr trasnsaction was smooth all the way and it was fast and easy.
4,Magic Mike,I love Channing Tatum and I am trying to get all his movie. But wow this movie was really raunchy but it did have really funny scene.
1,Terrible movie,Terrible movie. I do not think this should have had such great ratings with the critics. I could not stand any of it.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this film!.....it is aweful!,"The actors in this film have scraped the bottom of the barrel for money! This film is boring, poorly acted, embarrassing and a waste of time and money."
1,"Not sexy, characters have no chemistry, lame story",Director must have a thing for Tatum. 2 movies in a row that's boring and missed the mark in the genre. Other actors get zero lines and almost no screen time. Tatum has a hot bod and he can dance. But all the interactions with love interest and the kid have no chemistry. Was not entertained. Watch Step Up instead forTatum's dancing and 21 Jump Street for comedy. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Storyline was a complete downer,"I do not get the hype over this movie. My husband I rented this last night thinking it would be kind of cheesy and fun and get us in the mood for date night. Boy were we wrong. The characters were unlikeable, and we didn't really have a reason to root for any of them. The dancers were all drug addicts. The acting was horrendous. The dancing was upbeat and fun, but all other scenes were completely depressing. This was not the fun movie we were expecting."
3,It came fast...,It came very fast. It is an okay movie... lots of naked men and stripping... If you are a lonely 40 year old cat lady this movie is for you!
3,Flashdance meets Flashpants,"This was actually a bit better than I expected.Some characters are fun and a couple try to be complicated. Of course there is music, skin, drugs, and an awkward love story that tries to find it's way.I watched because my friends wanted to see it. I would have never chosen to watch this on my own but if you enjoy this genre; check it out... I think you could do worse."
2,Dialogue? What Dialogue?,"I rented this ""On Demand"" and really wish I had waited for it to come to cable television or something else that is free. It's like the writers didn't even try to come up with any kind of dialogue at all, let alone a plot that wasn't so riddled with holes it looked like Swiss cheese. If all you're looking for is Chippendale's with popular current actors from stage and screen, then this is your movie. I would compare it to ""Showgirls"" but I'm pretty sure that one at least had a plot that made some sort of sense. This movie jumped around so much it was hard to follow anything but the dancing. The scenes that didn't revolve around dancing were almost ""Blair Witch"" grainy, the dialogue was horrific and there is not one single solitary part of the plot that gets fully developed. I'm incredibly disappointed and for the first time in years I feel like writing to the studio and demanding my $4 back."
5,Entertaining,"Channing Tatum turns in a professional performance with his dance, athleticism and overall acting chops. His range is expanding and has the ability turn on both tough and sensitive nature in the same performance."
3,Not what I expected,"While I thought the movie had merit as far as the look and the acting, it was far more ""chick flick"" than anything else."
3,Digital copy,The digital copy accidentally got put on flixster and I can't put it on UV so now I don't have a digital copy for my ipad.
1,not to impressed,I watched this as part of my bachelorette party and well the story was pretty lame and the whole stripping thing just made me want to close my eyes the only decent dancing was done by the main character and all of it was before he had most or any of his clothes off. Basically if you like watching male strippers this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a decent story look elsewhere.
1,boring,endless.... even the video quality was painful to watch. How can you make such crap seem appealing in a trailer.
1,Not worth the time.,"YIKES! don't waste your time... the dancing isn't even good... really not worth the time, with so many other great movies out there."
2,Not as advertised ...,"So disappointed with this version of the movie. Love the movie (it's Channing Tatum, who wouldn't!?!?). And yes, the title does say movie only, but the product details say:Special Features- Deleted Dance Scenes- Backstage On Magic Mike- The Moves of Magic MikeTHESE ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THIS DISK. I am so disappointed that I am going to research if I can return on opened DVD .... I didn't realize until I started watching it that the only ""extra"" included was the interviews ""backstage"", no deleted dance scenes. :O("
1,Magic Mike,"What a waste of money. I rented it , gosh if I could get my money back. Be wise keep your $ for another movie."
2,My wife liked it,wife liked it very much. typical for a woman to like this kind of movie oh well what can i say?
1,Magic Mike,This was the most disgusting movie I have ever started to watch. I saw 15 minutes and took it out of the player and tossed it in the trash. So far below McCoughney's talent as a romatic/comedy lead. He is one of my favorite actors and I am just so disappointed.
4,good dvd!,"fun dvd, kind of mindless but the ladies will like it! gayguys will like the guys too, they are hot!"
1,Where's the magic?,"This is the worst movie we've seen. We kept leaving the room, hoping it would be over when we got back."
1,Not good,"I watched this because my wife really wanted to, and I believe that the fact that even she said it was not good is enough to justify my rating. The plot was muddled and overwrought, the performances were laughable, and overall it was just not worth our time."
1,Don't waste your money!,Terrible movie. Dark and sick (not in a good way). The budding romance or the great men's bodies did not help this story line. Pass it over!
2,Magic Mike,"Not a good movie , slow moving and as much talent that was in the movie they should of been able to carry it off."
2,Eh...not great.,"Ok so I had to see this because of all the hype but I have to say I was not impressed with this movie. The acting was terrible!! I mean I know ""alright, alright, alright"" is like Matthew Mcconaughey's ""catch phrase"" so to speak but...I feel like we already heard it so many times in ""Dazed and Confused"" and now we have to hear it a million more times in this movie? #annoying. Yes, The men stripping in this movie was pretty awesome but I feel like that's where most of the time was devoted, and not in the rest of the movie. Thumbs down."
3,Love the gorgeous guys.,"The guys were gorgeous and loved their moves, but overall the picture was only about 3 stars. Story line was just about what you would expect. No surprises and I actually dozed off for a bit, so I reset it and watched the part I missed. Didn't miss anything. It was a slow part of the story. Overall tho, for the price, wasn't too bad."
4,decent movie,"my wife liked it more than I did , but it was good and different, offering a male perspective to things"
3,"A+ Eye Candy, C Story","Could NOT finish watching '21 Jump Street', but followed the hype to Magic Mike. Nice showcase for Tatum & McConaughey - all kinda fun ways. I liked the Village People vamp camp move into Channing's big hip-hop solo, after which the story fell flat into 'seen-ALL-of-this' predictability. So I fell asleep. Still, actors inhabited their world well enough that I made sure to go back and watch the ending. Sexiest man of the year? I'm curious to see Channing after he gets some father life experience, especially whether his comedic or dramatic acting deepens first."
2,Meh.,I would have liked it better if it was a silent film. The plot was lame and I'm sad that I actually bought it.
5,Great movie,"Very hot cast, and yes there is a plot to it for those of you who need a plot to watch this movie. Good choreography too."
1,Not worth it,"We kept waiting for the movie to get better--never happened. If we hadn't paid for it, we would have turned it off."
5,Magic Mike,"What can you say.... yum, yum, yum.... again Channing Tatum doesnt disappoint with his dancing skills.. his wife is one lucky lady!!"
2,Don't waste your time and money,"dumb movie poor plot not worth the builtup. Kind of slimey movie, wish I had not wasted my money on."
2,Poorly done,"Movie was a dud. Not enough dancing,poor script.just not good over all disappointing. The script was unbearable and slow. Over all the movie a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
3,Okay,I think it is stupid I have to write 18 words to rate a movie. I think the stars should be enough.
1,Besides the men,The dancing was okay nothing much else there. was bored for most of the two hours. Wont suggest it to anyone
2,"Male version of ""Showgirls""","If you saw Showgirls and liked that movie, you'd probably like this one as well. Unfortunately, I thought this movie was terrible. The actors in this movie have WAY too much talent to be in such a bad film."
5,Loved It...,"What can I say.. AWESOME I loved the Characters, I was totally on the edge of my seat watching the moves.. WOW"
2,MAGIC MIKE IS VULGER,"iT WAS JUST AWFUL,VULGER AND REPLUSIVE, I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT HOLLYWOOD WOULD PUT OUT SUCH GARBAGE AS MAGIC MIKE"
5,Great movie.,I loved the Magic Mike. We had a girls night and got together and watched it. Channing Tatum looks great.
3,could have been better,"The moves were really good. The bodies were great. The music was good. The acting was good. The weak point of the movie was the storyline. It was a good story, but could have been told better. These actors are able do a really good job when they have a good script. I was glad I saw it at the discount theater."
3,kind of boring,"This movie lacked plot, although the view was nice!!! I wish they would have developed the characters relationships further, but I guess that's not what some people were looking for in the movie!"
4,This movie would be be nothing without Channing...,"I saw this movie because like most women on this planet, I like to see sexy men onscreen and fantasize about them. I saw this movie twice in theaters and there was only one reason: Channing Tatum. Without him, this movie wouldn't have even mattered. The plot was horrible, but what was even worse was the actress playing Channing's love interest. Her acting was so horrible that it honestly ruined the majority of the movie for me. Her phony laugh and amateur dialogue literally made me cringe. I really wish they would have chosen someone else. Other than that, Channing's sexiness definitely makes up for it all."
2,I was expecting more,"There wasn't enough Dancing.There wasn't enough Joe ManganielloThere was too much Matthew Mcconaughey - dude is creepy.I didn't expect a blockbuster but man this was boring. It was just over all lacking something. Why have a movie about strippers/dancers when only 1or 2 can actually dance? This really could have been cast better probably. The only real casting complaint I have though is Kevin Nash. Come on, really? Ex wrestler? He didn't even put in effort during the few routines. Maybe that is supposed to be his character, I don't know.Maybe I'm just being picky but I wanted to enjoy the movie, not be bored to death."
3,Not good for Karaoke,"This is not bad microphone when used on a mic stand. I have the SM58 connected right next to it and at the same gain level, the SM58 clearly sounded louder and clearer. I got the PG48 in a package deal, 3 mic 3 cable 3 boom stand, can't complain much there. But what bothers me the most is the handling noise. The sound created by you touching the microphone body, changing / adjusting your grip is clearly transmitted to the system as well, whereas the SM58 did not have this problem. I think a noise gate may help this problem but that's a pro PA item and most people don't even know what it is.It's built solid, like the other Shures.The main function for the PG48, like the other reviewer said, is to get abused by bad /crazy bands and you won't feel too bad."
4,Shure Mike,This mike works pretty well. I use it with an Yamaha Stage Pass PA system. I would like it better if if picked up from more that a few inches. I don't think it is a failing of the mike just my personal preference. It is definitely worth the money and if you don't want to spend much this is a really good choice.
4,This Microphone is Great for Beginners,"The Gain on this mic isn't the greatest, but for speeches and soft recordings: this guy can handle it all very well!"
4,PG 48,I was looking for an inexpensive mic to replace my SM48 & this turned out to be a very good mic.
3,Wrong description,"Just got it today through Amazon. Be aware! This product comes with a XLR to XLR cable, not a 1/4"" cable as described. Have to return it."
3,Mic,You need an amp with this! It will not work on your PC or any wimpy amp. When hooked to a good amp it works well with nice sound.
5,Great Microphone,Both my boyfriend and I do Karaoke 2 or 3 times a week and we are the only ones using it. It is a great Microphone and now we know we won't get sick using a microphone everyone else is using everywhere.
2,not every happy with the product,"I ordered two (2) used movies.One was working fine. However, the other has scratches and the disc is not working properly. I was disappointed."
4,Robert @ Ashley River El.,"I like this book because it has lots of reptiles and info. about the animals. It also has a letter for the animal like A is for Armadillo Lizard, and b is for Boa ect. I also think his pictures are fabulous."
5,Reggie @ Ashely River El.,The Yucky Reptile book was a really excellent book. I thoought the big slimy lizard was cool. But I was I was disappointed about the T-Rex not being in the book.
3,Zach W.@ Ashley River El,"This book is just CRAWLING with reptiles!! My favorite reptile illustrations are the chameleon and the skink. The illustrations are creative and wonderful. While being creatve, Masiello also make the pictures realistic, too. Wild!!!"
5,Mychael At Ashley River El.,I like a book called the Yucky Reptiles. It has some good illustration from Ralph Masiello. It has some nice colors.It talks about the alphabet. And it names the reptile with the letters of the alphabet.
2,The mystery is how to do this with anyone over the age of five!,"In theory this is a nice trick, but in order to get the ball to move up and down the tube you have to move your hand some. For anyone over the age of five this is a dead give away as to what's going on. however, since I do tricks for tots, they are amazed while their parents chuckle!"
2,Not too exciting,"Loud and squeaky, not what I expected. I never performed it in front of anyone I was trying to impress."
5,Pure Brilliance,"It has been a long time since I've respnded to a CD in the manner that I've responded to this arsenal of aural warheads. I'm almost 30 years old now and I thought I was becoming jaded to just about everything that's out there these days. Sure, there's some really cool stuff going on right now but nothing that grabs your heart and thumps your gut while simultaneously charioting you off into the stratosphere. Well, this CD fits the bill and fills the musical void left by bands like The Verve, early Smashing Pumpkins and Tool at their most tuneful.A quick rundown:Psychedelic? Mindblowingly so.Riffs? AplentyMusicianship? Ooodles. The drummer is fantastic.Prog? Its 1975 all over again.Brilliant Production? Indubitably!It's all included in the price of admission. Speaking of the price of admission, if you get the opportunity to see these guys perform live and don't take advantage of it consider yourself a fool. They are devastating."
4,Sure it's a good CD,"Okay.. You need to get out moreSure it's a good CD, but the best band of the year? It certainly has a few stand out tracks and as much as all previous reviews speak of the great musicianship I think a whole bunch of that is the outrageous recording. This CD is worth purchasing for the engineering alone. The mix and mic of the drums is as good as can be purchased in this genre. The guitar is textural and never too much or mixed too thick, which is the usual fault of this genre also.The point missed throughout the reviews is, if you don't like 21st century prog-rock you won't like this CD. It does not overcome it's proto-type. As well played and well recorded as it might be, it's still a genre based musical format.Exercise caution, this is not a cure all for anything. It is what it is."
2,promise falters,"i found this very disappointing.i had heard some of the earlier stuff and liked it,hence the reason for getting this album.this is somewhat different.i say somewhat because each song shows signs of their past with big amounts of promise but for some reason the singer changes it up in every song and they turn it into corporate rock/emo sounding.why they do this i have no idea other than to push more for the mainstream and $$$.i always find it disappointing when artists do this,liz phair anyone? as i see by my fellow reviewers i am alone in this thinking.oh well,i'm used to it.as i said,this album showed promise and would have been a 4-5 star if they just kept to their original style and didn't try to mix it up mid song,for every song.by the 10th track i turned it off to go do more important things.very disappointed."
4,Oceansized Wall of Sound,Me likey- Very well produced with layered guitars interwoven with electronic sounds pitting psychedelic soundscapes against progressive fusion rock. As the band name suggests the sound is sometimes like Jane's Addiction but with a Pink Floyd meets Tool mentality and an Incubus-like modern sound. Having said that... they still created a very original sound. Catalyst really kicks but the rest of the album is meant to be absorbed slowly as the songs do not follow the strict verse/chorus/verse/chorus formula of pop music but rather take you on musical journeys much like MarsVolta. Translation: you won't hear this on the radio.
5,You Are Very Sopecial,I purchased this as a gift for someone else. I did glance through it and believe it will be very beneficial to this person.
5,"Son love it, so do I..no banned chemicals in the ball.","Got this so my son 26mth old son can do yoga with me. He plays with it all day long, not just during yoga time. No banned chemicals, made in Italy, and just the right size for toddlers. Says it will hold up to 600lbs, I know it holds 220(my husband). Teaches balance, coord, and strengthens core muscles. I even use ot for leg and arm work."
1,Howl-a-boring,"This book is so boring.I don't recomend it. it is a activity book. I will tell you that the pages of 9-11 are the worst. please don't read this book. Most of the ""activities"" were easy as pie. The only time I actually looked through the book is whenit was a rainy day and I was bored, it was not worth my time. No offence David Brokaw."
2,Only for dummies,"Very little information of any real help here. No reviews of current equipment, or help in wiring. Very basic descriptions of home automation. Only for the truly dumb."
1,vague and useless...,"I was looking for specific, real-world help in creating at least a partially 'smart' home. What I found was vague and amorphous predictions for the 'future' and not remotely enough concrete advice or help. Here is an example of what I found on two pages (pp. 42-43) picked at random: ""will allow you to...are going to be...what's coming down the pike...you'll be able to...will change drastically"" This is ""Everything you need to prepare your home for the 21st Century""? I think not. This book was very, very irritating. If I had seen any part of it before placing an order, I never would have bought it."
2,I'm not sure I know what I expected...,"...but I didn't get much out of this book. Much of what was in it - I already do (for example, I have a home network with a central ""server computer""). I was hoping it would cover more about automating lighting and compare different methods/systems...Anyway, it also lacks much of the humor I normally find in ""dummies"" books - so it was pretty dry reading.Bottom line - not very impressed."
3,"Do you think 'network' means ABC, NBC or CBS?","If you think that 'network' refers to ABC, NBC or CBS, then this is a great book for you. I bought this book on the basis of the fabulous reviews on this site. However, I was very disappointed because of the lack of detail, specifically in the audio and video arena. This book is great if you are building a home and need ideas. I'd rate the coverage of the various areas as (1 - lowest, 5 - best): new home ideas - 4; audio - 2; video - 2; computer networks - 3; x10 automation - 4"
3,"A little dated, but good starting point.","The content is beginning to show its age. Broadband at home was not readily available at the time of printing, however the basics of setting up a home network still apply. There were some interesting sections that describe setting up a central control room for home media resources. I found the details of the approach less interesting than the rational that motivated it. That was worth the book to me."
2,"If your're not a dummy, don't buy it...","This book is good if all you want is an overview of WHAT you CAN do, but is nearly worthless if you are a do-it-yourselfer and want to know HOW to do it. It has almost nothing about the nuts and bolds of how to pre-wire or connect components for any of the systems. Every time it almost get into a ""how-to"" paragraph they tell you to buy ""Home Improvement for Dummies."" Hmmm, they get to sell two books instead of one... they're not dummies."
5,Unexpectedly fabulous book!,"Well I expected this to be a real low-level book written for total idiots. What I got was very pleasantly meaty and USEFUL. I'm going to be able to extend my home entertainment center around the house now by using the coax and wireless networking ideas in the book, and we're putting on an addition that's going to really need to be outfitted with the ideas in this book. I really highly recommend this book to anyone out there. It is just useful."
5,Smart Homes for Dummies Second Edition,If you would like to know more about electronics in the home this is the perfect book. Whether you are an expert or are looking in to having things installed in your home you can easily read and understand everything. Also the book is a great reference for companies and their products.
2,Not as informative as I hoped it would be,"I assumed this book would be about home automation, but it only briefly touches on that. It is mostly about wiring of distributed audio and video, which I didn't find very interesting.The book does contain some interesting and useful information, but it could probably all be squeezed into about 30 pages.The reader is directed to an an accompanying web site for up-to-date information, but the web site was last updated three years before the latest edition of the book was published."
2,Where's the beef,A good introductory book for understanding the options but not enough examples of how to use the technology in real life.
3,Great for New York City homes,"I live in New York City, and there are all sorts of limits as to what you can do with your homes, and so that limits how smart you can make your home. This book a fun mix of stuff that we've worked on, and while we don't have a totally smart home now, we've got a smarter home, and are working continually on it. We got a good broad view of everything we could do in one place -- for voice, data, video, audio, security, etc. We would have had to read five other books at least to find out the same amount of info, and then we'd have to figure out how it all fits together. On top of that, these guys have a sense of humor which kept me engaged throughout. Now if I could only afford the 42"" plasma screen outfitted hot tub they showed me."
3,Dated,"I'd like to give this book more stars but frankly it is out of date in several areas and if you don't know what areas then you could be in trouble. It needs an update. Many of the websites it refers you to don't exist -- companies have been bought or gone out of business -- technologies it says are coming have come... and gone. If there is a better book, I have yet to find it, which is sad since there are technologies that should be incorporated into homes -- few builders seem to understand how to build a smart home -- if the owner doesn't drive the process it won't happen or it won't happen right."
4,A Great Dream Book,"This is a great book. It shows dependable information about over 10,000 objects you could see in your dreams, and then a good meaning to what you could be experiencing in the past, present, or future. I reccomend this book to those who believe in this type of spirituality, and whi wishes to give this book a chance to be your guide.The Fae Girl"
1,This book stinks! It is a total waste of money.,This book does not give you any help in deciphering your dreams. I would definitely not recommend this book.
1,Not Helpful,"I purchased this book for one peticular dream I had. I was very disappointed to find that none of anything in my dream was in this book. I was looking for more of a dream interpertation than this book could give. I thought with 10,000 words something to do with conversation would be in there and it wasn't. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this book. I have read the rest of it and found it to be very basic information and nothing I could not figure out for myself."
3,Sort of depressing.,"Seemed like every explanation for every dream was doom and despair. I felt it better to not know my dreams than to look in this book as I seemed better off than when I read it. But it came in great condition, and has a lot of definitions."
5,what did you like or dislike?,"lindsay roberts , is a wonderful writer,easy to understand and is a great book!! would recommend it to read. fast delivery and would order again. thank you"
1,Fit is no good,"I bought this for 2006 Nissan 350z. It doesn't fit that well on if you use the ""din"" pocket and your radio. It also doesn't line up with the shifter bezel. Not a good buy."
1,worse than dust,A disappointingly trashy piece of dirt. It was way too violent; I couldn't watch it. Why would David Wenham waste his talent on this?
1,"Oh, please.","This is the kind of film people try to like because it makes them feel smart. But really, it's just pretentious drivel."
1,Got no talent? Make an homage,"Wow, did this miss the mark. You can get the basic storyline for this film from the Amazon review. Sounds intriguing, right? Well, the filmmaker desperately wanted to make a different kind of movie, and the desperation shows. This film tries so damn hard to be full of ""interesting characters"" that everything comes off like a student film. This is most obvious in the flashback storyteller, an old woman named Angela, who we are supposed to think of as cool and vaguely hip because she can talk trash with the black kid that breaks into her house. Good Christ, this was a bad movie. Obvious and superficial. The director's so-called ""homage"" to various film genres are just simply poor rip offs. Sort of like the rappers talking tonelessly over former hits. I guess if you have no talent, an ""homage"" is as close as you're going to come."
2,Bust,"Dust is NOT your typical western. It is impractical that a dying, elderly woman would befriend her apartment trashing/thieving thug, especially after he coldcocks her. Equally as rediculous is that this same thug would have genuine feelings for her at her dying bedside, a day after placing a gun to her head making demands....just stupid!This movie can be gorey also (ex: shooting and slitting the throats of sheep/goats, disembowelment, decapitation, etc.)Not sure I understand the positive reviews but that's just me.Not recommended."
1,"As the end credits rolled, there was a power blackout. Great metaphor!","Like watching HEAVEN'S GATE -- in the similarity of feeling: horrible pain and boredom.Starts out promisingly until it meanders and dies after about 30 minutes proceeding to a who gives a f reaction.The director has not worked since 2010, according to imdb. I guess they don't include janitorial work (for which he is qualified) in their listings.Over two hours I will never get back."
2,Dust,Did not like this movie. The storyline was very hard to follow and very bloody. I'm very sorry I ordered this one.
1,junk packaged as a western,"This is not a true western.you may have known that,I didnt.From the trailer there is no mention to the true nature of the story.The box looks like a western,the tag line is ""live by the gun, die by the gun"" even the description on the back makes it sound like a possibly good western that fell to direct to video hell.It says nothing about an old dying woman in a modern day city dealing with a lowlife thug for gold coins.Even if I knew how this junk really was IT still wouldnt be any good.0 stars,just a tease. YOU WERE WARNED."
5,A movie that tells the truth,"This movie is fantastic, espicially the scens that are set in Macedonia. I will however admit that the scenes in america were a bit boring however i still think this is a fantastic purchase.This movie tells the story of a macedonian village that is being over run by gheg albanians, then the greeks try to take it but the ottamen turks later on show up and eventually control all of macedonia.I am glad that this movie showed how albanian ghegs really do act, like savage brutes who rape litle boys and goats. The albanians are the scruffy looking people in white, while the greeks are portrayed as money hungry mercenaris who will sell out to anybody for the right price. They are the people in black uniforms.A good movie that is certainly worth your time."
5,Excellent music. thank you.,I am using for a dance class that I teach. Love it.This is music from my era and it brought back memories of my youth.
2,Everybody's a comedian.,"If you're looking for a serious hustle, be aware that this movie is only for those without skills for getting paid. The characters play the role of Keenan and Kel from Nick but more ridiculous. The quick-stick comedy keeps up the momentum of a Hollywood dream of signing a deal into the music industry. Their antics are well below the amount of work it takes to get in...but hey I can't knock the hustle!"
5,True to life account of the movie industry,"Having worked in the entertainment industry for over 25 years as both a casting director and an agent, I can honestly say that ""Agent"" is as true to life as it gets. Mr. Lazarus has written a wonderful novel that is both fascinating and humorous and should be enjoyed by both movie afficianados and literature lovers alike."
2,alpha home video -a toss-up,"Heart of the Golden West is a very poor transfer - washed out and a ghost image almost like you are watchign an old TV with an indoor antenna. I consider this unacceptable for a DVD. On the other hand, Come On Rangers is of better quality (though not excellent) and if this is the only film you care about ,it is worth while. The 2 stars are for Heart of the West."
2,mistakes,The mistakes and info left out in this manual will cost you dearly come rebuild time. If you are not rebuilding your engine then the manual is bearable except for the electrical system section.
2,Not very detailed,"I like the first person ""adventures"" from this period. This book never quite got my interest. Not enough details to make it feel like you got a look at what things were like."
4,perfect for a budding nature lover!,"I found the book to be well written and beautifully illustrated. A child would easily regonize the animal or bird by it's picture, and could then use the binoculars to learn more. Yes, it's best an adult helped out the first time, but my 5 yr old grand daughter picked up on the idea of binoculars right away. (""2 eyes can look in, instead of a camera where you can only use one eye, Gran'ma!"")"
4,Good...But not Very well.,"I did purchase this blue ray because I am locking for perfect performance of all pianos concertos from Beethoven. I think I am a perfectionist. To me this one item did not very well. To me stereo and not surround sound are not a problem. Like reference of perfectionism of five pianos concertos from Beethoven I have nominated Claudio Arrau because I do have and have been hearing that on Phillips cds audio. Shostakovich, Gábor Takács-Nagy and Bizet's symphony and the Verbier Chamber Orchestra are just fine."
2,no surround sound from Verbier again!,"For those of us expected to pay $30 or so for a blueray disc with NO surround sound, only stereo, this is a disgrace! These performances seem like they might be worth having, but to saddle a blueray performance with only stereo sound? What's the matter with this label?"
1,Keep Looking,"I just finished this DVD, and I have to say that if you wont good self defense keep looking. The moves were hard to see, and did not have good explanations. Not only that but if you tried practicing any moves someone would get hurt. You don't get enough angles on what is being done. If you don't have previous training this video is worth nothing."
4,A Treat.....,This is truly a beautiful and sensuous album. Freelon brings Nancy Wilson to mind with her effortless vocal range and style. A must-have!
5,Reviewing the Bare Faced Messiah,"I was very pleased with the whole experience, buying through Amazon. Great price, speedy delivery and the fact that I was able to purchase this book at all was really great. I know the book is out of print, that many copies had been bought up by Scientologists in order to prevent the material being widely available. However, the book is important, anyone interested in the subject should be able to read it for themselves. I'm not finished reading it yet, but, impressed with the way it's written....and, the information I'm getting. All good."
4,rest of the story,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYBefore he founded his worldwide church, Hubbard wrote science fiction, hobnobbed with occultists, and rewrote his history with a vivid imagination. He was a BSer supreme who transformed his mundane experiences into heroic ones. Maybe that's why he's so appealing to the naive Hollywood elite, who seem unable to discern fantasy from reality.As is the case with all self-appointed messiahs, he ruled his kingdom with a vengeance, making up the rules as circumstance dictated. Must read if you know anyone in scientology or are approached by those who are."
3,This book seems to be based on twists and opinion,"Although I found the book to be very well written and the context is large, there seems to be a lot of fact twisting and opinion, regarding the information that was gathered from others. I am a Scientologist and I am not gullible nor am I unintelligent. Actually, since I've been a Scientologist, I have learned so much, for the better, and all I've ever gotten out of it was great, simple things to help improve my life and others. Is John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, Juliette Lewis, Lisa Maria Presley, Tom Cruise, Jenna Elfman...are they gullible and stupid? Maybe, but I doubt it. In every dealing I've ever had with someone who could offer a negative comment about the subject, either they didn't really know what it was because they never experienced Dianetics and Scientology for themselves or they just took the opinion of ""bad press"" and exageration, to base their judgement with."
3,"If you are a dummy, you have no business writing C++ code","The title of this book implies that even a dummy can simply read this little yellow book and... bam!...just like that become a C++ programmer. This is simply not the case. C++ is a broad and complex language, and combined with the learning curve associated with object oriented methodologies, I can see how a reader would get very frustrated. This could be the reason this book has gotten so many poor reviews. That said, however, this book is not without its merits. It assumes a prior knowledge of C (kind of a cop-out according to the title) so no real explaination of the kernel language is presented. However, it actually does do a pretty fair job of introducing the elementry concepts of C++ and object oriented programming in down-to-earth language."
2,C++ For Windows Only For Dummies,"Do NOT get this book if you are: 1) Interested in learning platform and IDE independent/ANSI/ISO C++ 2) Are developing using Linux/UNIX, BeOS, MacOS/MacOS X or just about any OS but Windows 3) Are interested in learning C++ with a lot more explanation and understanding- for that I'd recommend The Waite Group's C++ Primer Plus."
1,This Book is Not For A C++'s Dummies.,This book shouldn't belong to the all-time-great Dummies' series. It's so bad that I gave it to my friend for free
3,Not for anyone,"I bought this book because i needed learn C++ very fast for a College work. I am not a computer geek, but i consider myself a computer fan. After red the half of the book i realized without C language knowledge is not much what i going to learn from the book. I got C++ in 21 days and result a lot easier to learn from it. Anyway, the C++ for dummies has a lot of good examples, and after know some C is very useful."
2,"What a horrible book, and I'm a C programmer!","First of all, this book is not for ""dummies"", and if you're experienced in C, as the book assumes, then you sir are no dummy. My biggest gripe is that the code examples are very poorly analyzed, and not broken down to a digestable level, which is the whole purpose of the Dummies series."
1,Do not waste your time.,"I used this book in connection with a class and another book, what a bad text! The examples are very hard to follow and unhelpful. After several times through, I was still confused. Not for anyone resembling a beginner."
2,Much better books out there,"This book, unlike the other dummies books, is not aimed at total newbies, because that would be impossible in a book this short. Although I used it to learn the basics of C++, I don't recommend it because : the book spends a huge amount of time on meaningless gibberish, when I read a programming book I don't want to laugh, I want to learn; the author does not understand the principles behind OOP, only some syntax; finally, this book is _entirely_ useless once you have finished reading it."
1,I was the dummy for buying it!,The book assumes that the reader knows a lot about c++. The examples are very technical and the explanations of processes leaves a lot of holes. I am more confused after reading the book. It is a complete waste of money!
2,Not very interesting.,"In comparison to Dan Gookin's fantastic synopsis of the C language, in C for Dummies, this book is nothing. What kind of book is this supposed to be?!? I cannot even read this book. It is very jam-packed, and hard to comprehend at times. My suggestion is to find a different book, one which has easier-to-comprehend chapters, and is not so boring. I believe I've proven my point."
3,Pick up another book,I bought this book a while ago and read about half way through. I had been programming Windows applications in C and wanted to take a object approach to solve limitations that regular C could not solve. I bought this book with the intention of quickly understanding C++. At mid point of the book I was introduce to a much more useful book that provided much clearer examples and organization of concepts. I abandoned reading this book. Even now I've pickup the book up attempting to use it as reference for various reasons and have found it difficult to find specific information quickly. Save you money there are many other books that would be more useful in learning C++.
2,Not the best choice,Why is this a For Dummies book if the author assumes the knowledge of C? Also the wording of some of the concepts was horrible. I certainly wouldn't consider this a good beginners book.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,Poorly organized.Difficult to find things you are looking for. Appropriate for a high school class.
3,It's ok...,"To get anything out of this book you need to know much about c coding. It's fun to read, with a lot of ironic jokes"
3,not for dummy at all,"This is a good book after all, you wont learn c/c++ byreading it. The title is little bit misleading in that sense.After having read, some intro c/c++ books. I went back andread it was then easy to understand, and to follow. I didlike the object oriented features, and the pointers section."
3,It's a compilation.,"It's good, for a compilation at least. I have never liked compilations or even greatest hits because I don't think they showcase anyone's personal strengths. There are a few gems on the album (Oh No, Madlib, Madvillain, Pure Essence, J Dilla) but most of the tracks are mediocre at best. A lot of the instrumentals are just boring and some, albeit different, are just bleh. I like Stones Throw and I like Peanut Butter Wolf, and I like most of the artists on here, it's just poorly put together, better songs are out there. It's Okay, I want to give it 4 stars but I just don't think it's that good. Not worth the new price but maybe used is a better deal."
1,Are you kidding me?! O__O,"No, really. Are you kidding me? This CD got mostly 5 stars? Pinch me, someone, I must be dreaming! I like Adult Swim, but I heard this CD and most of the tracks on this CD are simply atrocious! Is this what music is coming to? Man, my father was right when he said they don't make good music no more! Blah. If this is what ""experimental music"" sounds like then I want NO parts of it! Ugh!Note:Okay, granted MOST of the tracks 1-14 suck-I just listened to all of them-the last time I listened to this CD at all was when I heard those tracks through someone else, but I didn't get to hear the ones at the end of this CD. I just clicked on the samples just now. Except for the very last one, some of the tracks (15-18) sounded BETTER than the rest. They don't even belong on this complilation...in my opinion."
5,Grandkids love it,A great movie that my grandkids love watching over and over again. Love the art work on all the characters.
3,Lacklustre Grover,"Having almost the entire collection of Grover cd's I think its reasonably safe to say I like Grover Washington Jr. Mr Washington had a talent all of his own and all his music is uniquely recognisable. This album however, I have to confess, is not my favourite. Whilst enjoying this cd whenever played, I have to say it lacks something I cant quite define. The cd starts off with the tranquil and unruffled pace of El Precisco Perdoar. This is my favourite track and you quickly settle into its gentle rhythmic sway. The soft romantic tones are continued in track 3 I'm Glad There is You but Grover's timeless romantic quality inexplicably waivers on this cd. The playing quality is steady and consistent but it doesnt seem to quite reach the heady heights which most of his other cd's achieve."
2,Not My Favorite,I've seen other versions of this book with much better sidenotes about the text. I wasn't a huge fan of the layout of this book.
4,A Real Steal!,"At less than $5, you can't wrong with this cd, yet another terrific bargain from Infinity Digital. Plus it's Mozart! I know there are so many versions of these two famous violin concertos, but I find absolutely nothing to complain about in these delightful performances by Stang and Ioffe, backed by a respectable Russian orchestra. An added extra on this disc is the short but fascinating Adagio And Fugue For 2 Violins, Viola And Bass, In C Minor, which Mozart composed in the late 1780s after he was profoundly influenced by Bach. This is a very obscure Mozart composition that is difficult to find anywhere, nevermind closing out two classic violin concertos. In the end, on this disc you will get a lot of wonderful music for very little money."
3,Ten year old boy,"This book was about a solder called Rahotep. He was an Egyptian officer that fought against the Hyskos. The Hyksos were a strong people who tried to conquer Egypt and they succeeded. Rahotep was trying to drive them out. In the end he succeeded using his archers to fire upon their horses. The Hyksos had chariots. The Egyptians wanted to make chariots but they didn't have horses which pulled the chariots into battle. They decided to steal the horses. Since they had to shoot the horses, they failed in the last two chapters. I found the book to be a little complicated to understand, especially the soldier's names. I also found that this book had many cool battles, especially the last one. Reading this book could thrill you or bore you depending upon the kind of person you are. If you like battles you will like this book fine but if you don't then don't read it."
2,American living in Brasil,"I bought this book after my first year living in Brazil and I have to say, that it's beautiful. The photos are incredible and just make you want to make everything in it.But it's not too practical for an average cook such as myself.It's a great book to share the Brazilian culture with people who don't know... but I'm looking for other Brazilian cook books that will be more useful in actually preparing the dishes. The author travels throughout Brazil, so the recipes are very diverse.I personally use the internet to find my Brazilian recipes, and they've all been great. They're mostly in portuguese though. And I have the benefit of being in Brazil and knowing the dish names so I can look them up.I haven't found the book very useful at all for it's intended purpose of a cook book. But for showing family and friends... it's beautiful."
2,Ingredient Unfriendly,"The recipes sound mouthwatering enough, but the ingredients are too difficult to find. And even when I have found the ingredients, the end result is lackluster."
1,Not a good cookbook,"Like others have said, the pictures are beautiful, and the book is intriguing. The recipes sound great too. The problem is that they're really poorly written. He leaves steps out. Quantities don't always make sense. I was really disappointed. I won't buy one from him again."
5,A must-have for researchers,This book is a must-have for researchers in the area of microphone array.
4,Hawkman,"What seems a straightforward death from alcoholism and related causes turns out to be something entirely different once Hawkman becomes involved. Because members of his family know members of the dead man's family, Hawkman begins to ask questions.One fact leads to another and the inevitable suspicions build, pointing toward specific people. Are they guilty? Why did the man die alone in a motel room when he had a family?Hawkman seeks answers to these questions and wonders if a secret of the victim's family that involves non-family members could be the reason for his death. His investigation points in a specific direction and the law takes an interest.A recommended read sure to please any mystery fan who likes well-drawn characters, surprise endings and plenty of forward movement to keep you turning the pages. You'll be looking for other books by this talented author. Enjoy. I did."
5,this is cool,i relly like for one I like Celine Dion french&english work.Two she's relly good at singing.
1,insomnia medication,"i strongly recommend this album to those who r suffering from insomnia, this album really calms me and put me to sleep, to consider the fact the celine dion is not famous initially...i can see why now...its so evident in the way she sing... mesmering indeed, in a morbid way!"
1,my god is she singing,"is she singing or mumbling or bleating,she sounds like she is dying! my god celine dion i thought a name that will put mariah carey to shame, but instead shame herself in front of all the not even considered so good divas, come on come on ! u trash ...what else can u do?"
1,buy it at your own risk,"try buying this album and get a good grip ! u will faint at her voice, she totally turn people off!"
3,It was a Start,"Im not really sure if Gina Thompson is still in the music buisness, I have not heard anything else from her since 1996. But this cd is very average with good vocals from the artist but the same repetitive beats. She has or had talent and this cd will grow on you. I gave her 3 stars just because it all sounds the same. Nevertheless I still listen to it, so it must be alright to get occassional airplay in my house. This cd speaks about love entirely and some of the tracks have a jazzy feel and others are dance joints. One Love."
4,Great Buy,"One of my favorite albums. It was stolen while traveling so I had to buy it back. Few people know of Gina, but this album is a true R&B classic."
1,Crap,"I feel like I wasted 55.00. (I bought mine at Tower). The recordings are all bad quality. The ""Oops"" disc being the worst. Clearly an audience recording from the '70's recorded on a cheap tape recorder. The rest being taken from radio broadcasts or soundboard, but still bad. Very clear that this mess was just thrown together with no attempt at all to try and remaster or digitally enhance these recordings. This should have been a fantastic live Utopia retrospective document, but instead is a BIG disappointment. I expected more coming from Todd R. who is supposedly such a perfectionist. Too Bad!"
2,Disappointed!,I was pretty happy with this Box set until I put it into the CD player. The Oops! Wrong Planet set sounds just horrible. Foolishly I purchased this on a whim while at Tower Records without checking into it first here at Amazon. The money could have been better spent on their studio albums.
3,Slow pacer,"After having read ten or so of Max Brand's novels, I have true appreciation for his diverse work. However, I found ""Black Jack"" to be dull and monotonous. If a reader is looking for an entertaining read, ""Black Jack"" doesn't fit that need."
3,"The Good, the Bad & the Ugly...","This is a well written book.Some of the characters; I loved, some I hated & some confused me with their actions.That's life huh?The action was good but I didn't like the way it ended.It was like he ran out of time & didn't know how to finish the story so he just kind of wrapped it up all neat & coincidental.All in all; a good book for FREE!"
2,It was the best of times... It was the worst of times...,"As a professional technician and HTML guru, I appreciate a book that can take me from the humble beginnings of an electronic concept to the frenzied mastery of that subject. There are many good books out there on the subject of ASP. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. The lesson plans are solid, but WHOEVER proofed this book for typos in the code should be FIRED! If I wasn't already familiar with VBScripting, I'd still be sitting at my desk wondering what I was doing wrong..."
3,Good intentions but bad editing,"The intent of this book is to teach ASP by going through the steps of building a complex website, but it falls a little short in its goal. First of all there are many editing errors which can be frustrating when you don't catch them. The examples tend to get complicated pretty quick and it would be hard for readers new to ASP to catch on. The author seems to tell you what to do instead of showing you how and why you are doing it. One plus about the book are the many different aspects of ASP that it does cover, from database integration to setting up secure order forms, even touching on XML and SQL. This book is one of those to buy at your own risk, if you already know a some ASP and dont mind some editing errors then its a good deal, otherwise keep looking."
2,Buyer beware!,While this book has a sound approach to teaching the basics of ASP it has too many syntactic errors in it's examples for most beginning programmers.
5,A good book for asp database developers!,"This book certainly is not for novice reader. However, this book covers some areas which will certainly be very helpful to beginners as well as intermediate level database developers. There are very good examples in this book which can be used in a variety of ways. I was really impressed with chapters 5 and 7. Not very many books show such examples. For example, in chapter 7, it shows you how to update multiple records (updating quantity in a shopping cart) by using very simple sql statements. Certainly there are some typos in this book. Personally, if I want to test something, I like to type the codes myself rather than using codes from the CDs. This way I can ignore the codes which will not serve my purpose. Overall, this is a very good book for asp database developers."
1,This book is riddled with errors,"The messages posted here do not concur with my experiences.It is a FACT that there are a huge number of errors in the code provided which will make you wish that you bought something that had been proofread properlyHow long did it take the list of people below me (all strangely giving the book 5 stars suggesting that it could not be improved on) to get through ASP 3.0 from scratch? I have an Computing related degree and am an accomplished programmer but gave up after 4 chapters and weeks of misery.This book is, in it's current fault ridden state, a very poor purchase and would dissuade any 'from scratch' programmer from pursuing what is in essence a not difficult technology."
1,Don't buy this book,"The book is filled with errors - so many that the author has a web site that attempts (and fails) to forwarn you of all the errors. ... The book promises to give you step by step instructions, then makes HUGE leaps of logic that you will spend hours trying to figure out...END"
3,"It's OK, but you better be very intuitive about developing","I started reading ASP from Scratch to supplement my reading of ""Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0"" by Wrox (which is a great starting point, highly recommend). I was lucky to have some background of ASP. Chase goes right into code, and you better read every word or you are apt to miss something that is integral to the program. If you are the type that likes to learn the basics, stay away form this book. Chase seems to be able to dive right in and hope that you can pick it right up with out much of an explanation. It's not a bad book for some one with an understanding of what is going on in developing a web site. All in all it is not a bad book, but not my first recommendations for a beginners guide."
5,"This Book is great for creating store front, it rocks!!!",I read a lot of computer books. Most of them are either too theoretical or not hands-on. But I'm so pleased that I have chosen this book. It is very praticle and I wish I had this earlier. This book rocks!!
1,Worst editing job I have ever seen,"This book has got to be the worst book I have ever seen as far as editing is concerned. There is an EXTENSIVE errata page and even after using it, the application that you create with the book doesn't work. I do not recommend this book to anyone. How anybody could give this book 5 stars is totally beyond me."
1,Don't buy this book,"Ideas poorly explained. Spent much time trying to work things out for myself. Book is a dead loss not even in the same league as wrox ASP professional. As for the dedication and acknowledgements ... you fool yourself and you fooled me, hopefully no-one else."
3,THEY WANT YO HANDS UP,"1.""TOUCH ME TEASE ME""-I have heard better songs from both of these people, I wish it would have been better.2.""I LIKE""-I kinda like this joint, it is pretty good3.""MY CREW CAN'T GO FOR THAT""-Pretty good, it isn't the best on this cd4.""AIN'T NOBODY""-FINALLY a song worth playing more then once.

2,Not what I was hoping for,"I've had German Chocolate Cake coffee from a company no longer availabe in my area. This one did not match up for me. I think the packaging was mislabled??? While perhaps mildly chocolate in flavor, not a hint of coconut. But the price was good for the coffee (as a regular coffee). I'm just disappointed that I cannot get my hands on a good ""German Chocolate Cake"" flavor."
5,German Chocolate Cake in a cup,This coffee tastes just like German chocolate cake but not too sweet. The rich blend of milk chocolate and vanilla with a little bit of coconut tastes great! I would definitely buy this product again. It is one of the best I've tasted from Coffee Masters.
4,"Not quite, but close",I expected a little more coconut flavor and a little less dark chocolate....but overall a nice flavored coffee.
3,Warning - Set no longer 18/10,"Buyer beware -- I was disappointed upon receiving my set to see it is no longer 18/10. Reed & Barton stopped making this in 18/10 a few years ago. I called the company directly to confirm. If it was 18/10, it would be stamped directly on the flatware. It is not. It is only 18/0."
3,Doodles,"I was disappointed in this Flatware Set. Six forks were sent back within a week or two after purchase due to stains that had an appearance of rust. Also, other pieces have stains as well. The set is dishwasher safe so that cannot be the cause. The mat finish is not smooth and spotless. I'm afraid what this set will look like in six months. The set says Made in China, probably inferior material. If I knew how the set would turn out, I would not have purchased it. I am not happy with this recent purchase."
5,Very Nice,Very nice quality. I am very pleased with this purchase. I got an amazon warehouse set that looked brand new. The items are high quality and will not bend without some force.
1,Beware install does not load and NOOO tech support,"I ordered this camera and tried to install it on WinXP, WinHome, and Win2000. The CD did not install the palm files on any of them. I downloaded the driver from their support page (it is the same as the one on the CD) and of course it still didn't work.I emailed Micro Inovations tech support 3 times and no response except one automated one. I waited for 40 minutes on their help line when the support person answered he promised he would email me the new driver in ""5 or 10 minutes""; three days later no driver.So I guess I may never get a chance to actually judge the camera. If I do I will write a different review. Before you buy this be sure to go to the support page of their website and download their driver and see if it installs."
5,For True Teena Marie fans only!!!!!!!,"I am a true Teena Marie fan and I simply love anything she puts out. If you love old school, then this is a perfect CD to add to your collection. CD is filled with great ballots. My favorites are Deja Vu, Now that I have you, and Turnin' me on......Oh I love it. For true Teena Marie fans only!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome look back at the Motown Years.,"Although Teena's best work happened in a Epic/Sony. This is an excellent look back at all the Motown hits that established her as a writer, arranger, producer, and powerful singer. Motown adds two previously unreleased songs which are must haves for anyone who loves Teena Marie or a lover of R&B music. (If you want the best at Epic get ""Lovergirl: The Teena Marie Story""."
4,This group was kickin' it with the descargas!,"Cachao leads a group of all-stars on this well-executed CD. My favorite track has to be #4 El Son No Ha Muerto showing the whole new school that El Son is still alive and well. You gotta love the tres player, who was very outstanding."
1,Angry Fan.,"As a HUGE Aerosmith fan, I was annoyed at the prospect of buying yet another greatest hits collection (Columbia and Geffen keep firing back and forth with GH/BO/Live collections), but as a consumer mule, I said ok. After all, there were a couple of new tracks on it that weren't available anywhere else. But what really got me angry was that most of the songs on the discs are EDITS which are missing little pieces here or there. As a fan, you expect the songs to sound a certain way, but pieces of the songs are chopped out. Why? To save a few seconds per song? Are these the radio versions and this disc is a collection for DJs who have to be mindful of how long songs run? I was especially angry that they chopped ""What It Takes,"" which is my favorite rock ballad. GRRRRR..."
4,tank will travel,well this tank is small to keep a fish in full time. i ended up throwing out the rocks i hated the color and the plastic plant was to sharp for little betta fins.this tank however is great when i have to move mr Betta or clean his big tank. the lid lets me know the fish will be safe when i move him around. he isn't to happy about being in there but the container is very secure for traveling. just make sure you have a towel around it because the thing will leakthis is not good for betta to live full time.just remember this rule. 1 gallon of water for 1 inch of fish. bettas are 2-3 inchs.
4,This tank has been fun,"On a whim, I bought a live Betta and this tank (although I did not buy it from Amazon, I thought I would go ahead and review the product). The Betta is very happy in it, and he has actually become quite a friendly fish. He'll come up to the side of the tank when he sees me or my daughter and ""play"" with us.The only downside to this tank is that it needs to be cleaned regularly. I tend to be a little compulsive, so I clean it completely at least once (and usually twice) per week. This means removing the fish and rinsing out the entire tank and gravel (don't ever use soap, however). But I suppose all tanks have to be cleaned, and it's not that big a deal given the joy that ""fishie"" brings my 2-year-old daughter."
3,Can Be Wall Mounted,Perfectly fine LITTLE tank for a Beta. Nice option to have it wall mounted. Holds a comfortable half a gallon of water.
2,Really hard to clean,"The little rocks never stay in their plastic square. First, Taskin knocks them all over the place, then it's really hard to get them back in."
1,dont buy this,"This is way too small for a betta, dont even waste your money bettas need at least 3 gallons of water. In this you would have to do daily water changes which would stress out any fish, and i've seen bettas sold that if put in here would be too large to turn around in here! An animal is not meant to be fashion statement, and the whole purpose of this tank was to look nice. Put a plant in it, not an animal."
1,BAD!,"This is marketed for betta fish. A betta fish needs more room then this 1/2 gallon tank. Minimum, absolute minimum for a betta, is 2.5 gallons. Do NOT buy this for your betta."
1,not what i ordered,The site said Marina Betta kit large 3L and when I received it was the small 2L. Was not happy when I called the company and they said they only sell the 2L size.
1,"Looks Great, but Mine Leaked","The Marina Betta Kit looked awesome. be bought it thinking it would be the perfect small fish tank for our child. Unfortunately, it leaked. It lost about 3/4 inch of water over an 8 hour span of time. Buyer beware!"
1,Far too small for a betta...,"Contrary to popular belief, Wild bettas live in vast rice paddies for most of the year, and are trapped in small puddles for only a few months out of the year. It's not that they prefer small bodies of water, but that they can survive in them for a few months. Otherwise they live in vast amounts of water.Additionally, while wild bettas may be able to survive in small puddles for a small time, fancy bettas are not similar to wild bettas in this aspect; they need stimulation (like plants and hiding areas) and prefer larger aquariums (personal experience as well as research).I understand the appeal of this aquarium, but I'd only keep a plant in here. Otherwise, I don't consider this a suitable living space for a Betta. It's affordable, so if you need a temporary aquarium while setting up a real aquarium (waiting for the good bacteria to set up and all of that), this is fine."
2,"Looks good, for about a day","I had one of these awhile ago when I thought it would be nice to have a (relatively) hassle free pet, but it just became too much of a pain. When you clean it you have to put all the little pebbles into the square in the middle, then anytime you pour in any water (or even if the fish swam by too quickly like when startled) pebbles would fly out of the inner square making you have to dig in there to fix it. It wouldn't look right if you left the pebbles/sand in there wherever. Also after about a day it would look dirty again because ANY poop the fish left would be on the floor would take away from the whole 'zen' look of the thing. It's a neat idea for a (tiny) fish tank, but because of the amount of work that you have to put in to keep the tank looking good/clean it's not worth it."
2,Too Small,"This may seem like a good ""aquarium,"" but it is not. This is FAR too small for a betta. Pet shops that sell them in tiny bowls do so because they are an inexpensive way to seperate them. The pet shop conditions are intended to be ony temporary. My betta is in about a 2.5 gallon tank and is so happy. He was once in a small bowl and did nothing. Just lay on the gravel. About a 3 gallon tank will house a much happier fish, and a more entertaining one. Do not buy this."
3,not big enough,"having seen this in stores, i am warning possible buyers that this is smaller than you think. ghost shrimp or snails are the only good fit for this really cute box."
3,Good for Travel,I liked this tank because I don't have a lot of space away at school. It fits one betta fish (no more than one).There is no room for a filter-- but a plant helps with maintaining the oxygen levels and keeping wastes down. I clean up the food my picky betta misses with a net. I also change about a quarter of the water in my tank every 2 days. It has held up really nicely so far. My betta is happy. I wish I had room for toys. Poor guys bored and stares at me half the time :-) lol. I think he needs something to do.
2,Not so good...,"This was the first tank bought when I purchased my betta. I quickly found out that it wasn't a practical living container and moved to a 1.5 gallon tank with a filter and a small heater pad. Being in the larger tank he absoultely flurished, and within time, once I was able to save up my money, I purchased a 5.5 gallon tank with a heater/filter combo and have since moved him into there.I still keep this small tank around when doing water changes. It works well as a temporary housing unit, and could even be used as a sick/hospital tank.I would not recommend this tank as a living condition for any fish."
5,Perfect,"After a coworker stole my last connector, I got this one and it works perfectly. Listen to your Ipod through your cpu speakers or other freestanding speakers with a headphone input."
5,Just right,I can't believe the hardcover edition is out of print! This is one of the best books I've read to help the self-esteem of children with Add or LD or any other kind of learning problem.It doesn't dumb down the criteria. It shows the child being the hero of the story using some of his natural abilities. It also shows some of the techniques he develops for learning. It is a wonderful story for any child with or without a disability.
1,disappointed,"The book, though could be identified & related by some children with this disorder, mentions very little about the symptoms of ADHD, minimizes the realistic aspects of having this disorder, is ambiguous about the treatment processes details. As a therapist who sometimes uses books with children in treatment, this book has not been effective as I had hoped."
1,Crazy Book,"This book is almost totally devoid of any sense, common or otherwise. It is the only book I have tried to read from Abdullah and I did try.The attempt showed that any claim of relationship to Gurdjieff's ideas is either on a plane that I have not reached or misunderstood theories. The same applies to Sufi origins.I can not recommend this book to any Gurdjieffian, Sufi or a person who does not know about these teachings."
2,Not his best work...,"I've been a Doug Stone fan for years and still never warmed up to this album. Only note worthy song here is the title track ""Faith In Me Faith In You."" Save your money on this one and buy a compilation that includes the title track."
2,Doesn't match oem exactly,"Unit works well enough so far. I like that it came with bulbs. I do not like that it is not an exact color match of an OEM unit. It is very noticable that it has been replaced. I'll likely to buy the other side to have them match. Should not have to do that.So, buyer beware!"
3,Evaporation...,"I have owned a Bunn coffee maker for the past 20 years (not the same one). I have always found them to be excellent working and long lasting. My one complaint is that of evaporation. If you do not use this coffee maker every single day, the water in the reservoir evaporates and when you go to brew your next pot it does not fill it completely. So, you have one of three choices to make. First, you can pour more water in to get a full pot, but you will be guessing at the correct amount and you will have to wait while it continues to brew with the new water you have poured in. Second, you can run just water through it the first time to get the water level in the reservoir to the proper level, but this too takes time. Third, you can drink it like it is (usually kind of strong). That is the only thing that I do not like, have never liked, about Bunn coffee makers."
4,coffee pot,"Love the coffee pot,but,when it arrived the pot was broken at the topI still use it for now,was a little disappointed in that but not Bunns problem,must have been in shipping."
2,I do not have this item,"Sorry, I do not have this item, I ordered it, and after receiving the Bunn Pot you sent, which was the B moidel of his, and after being told that you did not sell this item, I do not know what this coffee pot is like. So I cannot rate it"
5,This thing rocks.....,"3:02 from the time you close the lid on it, until it's coffee time. Once you get the amount of coffee to use set, you'll love this thing. If I get the longevity out of this that Bunn is known for, I will probably consider this the most ""nice to have"" purchase I've made except for a dishwasher. Plus, it's made in the US!"
4,good coffee maker,"easy to use, makes coffee speedily in about 3 minutes. one problem is the carafe...lip is not deep enough and when I pour my coffee it sometimes runs back onto the counter, which is why I didn't give it the 5 stars."
3,Not as good as the traditional Bunn,"This coffee maker is functional and worked well for me for 3-years. I drink a lot of coffee so it probably averaged 2 pots per day for the period. This is my third Bunn and the others all lasted longer. It started leaking clear hot water when we brewed a pot so we replaced it with a traditional Bunn. I agree with the reviews that say the coffee tend to be weak- I like it that way. It is quick, and if I'm waiting for a new pot of coffee I appreciate that a lot."
5,"Fast ""pot of coffee""",No problem with shipping or new product. Received quickly - have had one of these in the past (replaced one that was 4 years old) - like this brand because it brews a pot of coffee in 3 minutes.
1,Weak Coffee,"If you like strong coffee dont buy this machine. Yes it makes smooth coffee but its weak. I even bought Extra Bold coffee, whole bean,and ground it myself, from Starbucks and used more than 2 times the normal ammount! The coffee was still on the weak side. VERY dissapointing!"
4,Bunn Coffee Maker Review,This is a well designed product. This machine makes a great cup of coffee. Bunn uses a proprietary pre-heat function to store hot water on demand. Making a pot of coffee is efficient and quick. The only problem I had was the internal heating element gives off a funny odor during the break-in period.
5,worth the price,"This is the first Bunn I have ever owned, and I must say it is much superior to all of the other coffee makers I have used in the past. I like the fact it brews in 3 minutes and makes great tasting coffee. The carafe does not leak when pouring like most of the other brands did. It is easy to use and I would definitely buy again."
4,Good Coffee Maker,I bought this model Bunn for work to replace a much older model in the same style. It works great and is very easy to operate and clean. The coffee we drink is just ok because we drink cheap coffee but you can't blame that on the pot. I would recommend this pot to any businnes as their lunch room coffee maker. It may not be the right model for home use however as it is bulkier and always has the power reserve tank on. My only complaint is the carafe. The pour of the glass mold in manufacutre is off and it spills out the side to the right when using it to put water in the coffee maker. We just use the old carafe and it works fine.
4,Good coffee,Overall this is a good machine (so far) but why can't they make a pot that doesn't dribble all over the counter when trying to pour!! hate that!! But it is fast & makes good coffee.
5,How to correct the evaporation thing,"Many reviews speak of ""short"" pots due to evaporation.This is my solution; pour in about half a pot of water and let it drip through the Bunn. The water will run through and you will hear the heating element heating the water that you just poured in the machine. Now check the level of the coffee in the pot. Next fill a Pyrex measuring cup with enough water to fill the now near half full pot to desired level. When you hear the heating element shut off pour in the second measure of water. When the heating element is on it makes a sizzling sound. When the heating element shuts off so does the sizzling sound. You may doubt this process, however try it, the first time you will like it.This technique makes a better cup of coffee. The first dose of hot wets the coffee, the second completes the extraction. I bet this is not the first time you have read a recommendation to split the water into two partitions.Bunns are great coffee makers."
3,"Love the system, hate the coffee caraffe","It makes great coffee, very fast, but I hate the caraffe. It dribbles no matter how we pour it. I always have coffee on the counter or floor."
1,TERRIABLE COFFEE,THE COFFEE TASTES HORRIABLE THE HEATING ELEMENT HEATS THE WATER SO HOT THAT IT BURNS THE COFFEE IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! WENT TO WALMART AND BOUGHT A $20.00 COFFEE POT THAT WORKS GREAT AND THE COFFEE TASTES GOOD. BUNN IS NOT THE BEST!
2,I agree with Jill Rosenberg,"If you enjoy rather thin, weak coffee, this is the machine for you.To brew a robust cup of coffee with my new Bunn, I find I must grind my beans extremely fine and use double the amount I used in my old Cuisinart.This gizmo will become a gift for my sister-in-law who prefers translucent coffee, quickly brewed. I'm buying another Cuisinart."
1,watch your electricity bill -- this machine is always on!,"I don't need to save the two extra minutes to heat the water in the morning, and the waste of electricity is outrageous. Shame on them for making this a mini hot water heater that is on all the time."
3,"FAIR, BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE!","After spending a couple of hours on line researching coffee makers, I decided to purchase this one based on the many good reviews given by other customers. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I received this product. I thought I was getting a high quality coffee maker, professional grade. Instead, I found it to be of lower quality. Portions of it, including the filter holder, were made of plastic, similar to cheap coffee makers you find at your local department store. The lid is flimsy and does not sit in the pot properly. There is no timer, which is important if you like the coffee brewing when your alarm goes off. As for the coffee, it is hot, initially, but does not stay hot for that second and third cup. It tastes good, but no better than the coffee made with the Mr. Coffee maker it replaced, which was 1/3 the price."
2,Great coffee - unreliable coffee maker,We owned the Bunn NHB for only 6 months before the burner stopped working. A call to the customer service yielded a pathetic repair policy that demands the owner personally swallow the cost of shipping to the repair facility in Iowa - this on top of the fact that the owner will have to wait upwards of 3 to 4 weeks for repair and shipping without a coffee maker. All this after paying $100 for the coffee maker to begin with? Thanks but no thanks.I'll be buying a Cuisinart or a Krups next time. Goodbye and good riddance Bunn...
1,First 5 months were great !,Now it starts to drip before I can get the pot under it... verydisappointed.....Had hoped this was finally the one.
5,great coffee in three minutes!,"Until we bought this coffee maker, we only brewed coffee on the weekend at home. We would wait until we got to work to have our first cup because the previous coffee maker we had, which was a grind and brew, took 20 - 30 minutes to brew even a half pot of coffee and we didn't have that kind of time on a work day morning. But now, we make coffee several times during the week, as well as the weekend, and the coffee is just as good, or better than the same brand of coffee that took 20 minutes to brew in the other machine! In the time that you brush your teeth, the coffee is done, and steaming hot, and ready when you are!"
2,cold coffee,"This maker is fast brewing, but the coffee isn't HOT when done brewing. I have to re-heat in the microwave to get hot coffee from this so-called great Bunn Coffeee maker."
4,"Its a good news, bad news product.","I had heard from a few sources that Bunn was the best. Good news: It does brew in a few short minutes. Bad news: it uses at least 1 extra scoop of coffee grounds or you end up w/ very weak coffee and it brews at least 2 cups short of the water you pour in, so you need to figure that out.Bottom line, it takes some getting used to. You'll spend more on coffee with this one."
4,Filter problems,"The coffee maker is everything you expect from Bunn. However, finding filters at your neighborhood store is next to impossible."
2,No small servings,"Very disappointed with this machine. I would not brew with less than 6 or 7 cups of waters. I almost never need that much and usually only brew 4 cups each time. Wastes a lot of coffee and isn't that hot when it's brewed. If you brew 10 cups each time, this is probably great for you. If not, pass on it."
1,Disapointed,"There are several things that could be improved. The flip cover is not as easy to use as it should be and if you don't poor perfectly straight it will leak to the side. The filter holder collects condensation around the rim and drips whenever it is removed after brewing requiring floor clean up, unless you keep a paper towel under it when removing. The brewing is quick, but as others have posted, you will always get the same taste. Making stronger coffee is not possible. To me, the unit is overpriced. We have used Couisinart for several years and decided to try something different. The Couisinart requires little or no cleaning and you can vary the strength of the coffee. You can also poor coffee while it is brewing and the filter holder won't drip when removed due to a spring loaded stopper on the bottom of the holder."
1,bunn,This thing no time started leaking around the seals and the pot never would stay hot.Just went back tomato coffeepot thanks anyway
5,Addictive Album,"I, unlike the other reviewer, see this as the best of the lot. Yerself has some moments(car wash hair! saw it live and it blew me away)and Boces has that one song(the first one)but this one has a flow and is consistently strong throughout. Sudden Ray of Hope gives off a warm feeling that one can rarely experience through sound. There are moments of Empire State and Young Man's that have more energy than a nuclear plant. Deserter's song was a great album as well but almost a little too sweet in places. This is the one for me and hopefully you will enjoy it as well. If you like this one try out the latest Flaming Lips."
4,Worth the $$,"Good product, shipped same day as ordered and received without any shipping damage! Will work with midi lathes with some modification!"
1,junk,"you get what you pay for sometimes, it is not worth teh box it came in. if I could rate negative stars I would!"
4,Very nice tales book.,"I always liked this book and after loosing it, I was happy to get it again. Very nice not too long tales for teenagers and older people."
2,Mas Andres,"He has such an incredible voice, but you won't hear it on this CD, it sounds like he is in another room with the door closed, really muffled. This is poor recording quality: to hear his voice try Tinta Roja and El Cantante, hopefully he will go soon back to the producer and musicos he used on those CDs."
1,A sorry excuse for a country album,"This is not a country music album and should be in the easy listening category along with all his other albums. You might like this CD if you're new to the country scene because it sounds a lot like the easy listening music you've heard. But as a country CD...NO WAY! Mark, you have a good voice but try choosing better music in the future."
3,"Nice Quality, not custom fit",I returned mine. My CRV had a drivers armrest and these seat covers did not come with or have a way to accommodate the armrest other than to leave it up and cover it (never be able to use it. The quality seemed good otherwise.
5,Outstanding collection of Tutu's antiapartheid efforts,"The Rainbow People of God is a must-have anthology of Desmond Tutu's most motivating and inspiring letters, sermons and addresses between 1974 and 1994. John Allen (editor) includes some of Tutu's most memorable public addresses and skillfully weaves historical background information into the public addresses for the reader's benefit. This proves extremely helpful in painting an overall picture of the antiapartheid movement in South Africa. Anyone who has listened to Tutu speak understands that he often employs humor to illustrate the darkness and oppression caused by apartheid. Readers expecting such humor will enjoy complete satisfaction in this collection of Tutu's speeches. Through Tutu's voice, we learn how he successfully merged African and Christian philosophy to become one of the key players in defeating apartheid."
3,Gag Gift,This is cute & good for a laugh. It was purchased as a joke for a Real Estate Attorney. Obviously it's not intended to be educational or for kids (thus the low marks). It is small - only a few inches tall. The laugh was worth a couple of bucks.
5,truly wonderful,"Courageous, breath-taking insight into the shabby workings of the white male mind. This is a truly great book. Chicago's life is an inspiration to all of us. I'm giving this book to both of my daughters."
5,"Good Grief, More Peanuts!",More of the same kinds of strips you've come to love over the years. A single year's worth of strips in a single volume. Hundreds of laughs that touch the heart.
1,Must Read for All Judeophobe White Supremecists,"That this guy is actually a tenured professor at Cal State just about disproves his central theories of Jewish control of just about everything. His academic jargon in no way disguises his obvious Aryan White Supremecist thought.If you are looking for serious scholarship, dont waster your time. If you want pages and pages of quasi science that seem to prove assertions that are completely unsubstantiated, this is the mac daddy of the social science equivalent of Macdonald's without Ronald."
5,Great Study in the Impact of Radical Critique on the USA,"Read this book, and you will develop an understanding of why the west is in such trouble regarding: the loss of family/cultural values, the unrestricted immagration of the underclasses of other nations, and the general wreck of Western Civilization and its historic values.I cannot say enough good things about this book- plus, it is a easy book to read!"
5,The elephant otherwise unnoticed and unremarked upon,"To read this intellectually intoxicating book is suddenly to realize how unfree public discourse in 21st Century America really is.MacDonald's argument is compelling and, in its broad outline, rather obvious. It is serious and brilliantly illuminating. It is in no way hateful or racist. But MacDonald says things that you just don't hear said, that never appear in our famously free media. MacDonald is a real hero for so boldly describing this elephant in the modern intellectual history of the West, an elephant that stands otherwise unnoticed and unremarked upon."
5,IMPORTANT BOOK FOR THE 22 ND CENTURY,"Amazon should be congratulated for having these books. With the rise of Anti Semitism, its important to be able to argue with historical facts and data.congratulations amazon"
5,Our modern Darwin,"Genius is a much over-used word in modern times, but with Mr MacDonald it's entirely appropriate. He's even been vilified by the academic establishment like any true genius should be! This book is one of the most important ever written, right up there with the Origin of Species and Das Kapital. If you are unhappy with modern times and can't understand why we seem to be destroying the very foundations of our society, read this book. He doesn't just make it clear, he provides notes and sources and an intellectually rigorous argument, which is why the media ignore him. One day, we will raise statues to him - if our culture survives."
4,WORTH THE LITTLE BIT,"I would start by telling ya that if ya have played the original like I have for the past 7 months, then you will know this game is very addictive and fun or boring at times. The number of people playing have decreased but Yet people like me who have hope stay. The game really started getting boring when they started more servers but now that they have completly taken out about 5 to 7 of their servers and made new maps and new things to do there is a real reason to play. Lag is NOT as bad anymore and I have not crashed in a long time. Lets just say alot of PVP and it really is exiting to say the least. ANd hell it is only 20.00 bucks and I know people waste that much on things much more stupid so WHY NOT? I say go for it I know I am and can't wait to get it in and try oput the new mobs,zones,classes,runes, ect......"
1,Long Time Subscriber,"I recommend that you avoid purchasing this game. I subscribed to Shadowbane a month after release. Most of the bugs that led thousands to leave the game still exist. Most of the recent changes to the game have been exactly the opposite of what the playerbase has loudly asked for. Bottom line - this is not a game that caters to it's customer base. Many of us are still playing only because we foolishly subscribed for a full year.If your curiosity is so great that you must purchase this game then DO NOT fall into the trap of opting for one of the extended subscriptions. Yes you do get access to restricted races for your character, but when you find how horrid the gameplay is you will kick yourself for purchasing your months in advance."
3,her life-isadora duncan,"As a keen fan of autobiographys this book automatically appealed to me. although I had not heard of Isadora's profound infleunce on the world of art or dance, the reviews on the book sold it for me. I thouroughly enjoyed her abstract and sometimes perplexing stories about her up- bringing. However as her travels with her family increased i found her to be quite selfish and single-minded in regards to her career. This i felt led her story, although a biography, to become quite a monotonous and tedious read. In her favour I would say that the book is written in an honest and frank manner."
3,interesting,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about Isadora's life in her own words. However, I found the story to be a little boring because it focused exclusively on her life with no other background information to read about. But, again there are interesting details included about the author's life."
2,Fine book... cost way too high for product!,Way too expensive for a 7-10 page eBook. The story is fine but much shorter than a paper Dora book.
3,"Perfect illustrations, but way too short for the price",Buy the printed one for the same price! Illustrations were very clean and the audio was nice. I guess it's just in the name (high price at the time)
2,Kindle version won't download!,Bought the kindle version and it will not download so had to return it.. I guess we go with the book version with this one.
3,Dora Book,"This is a cute book and my son likes it, but I was a little disappointed in the length. I was thinking it was going to be a longer book for the price."
3,Good but short,My daughter is a dora fan. She loves the book but for the price it's too short. It should be a little longer.
3,Does not fit Delta dust collector port,"This adaptor connects a 5"" hose to a 4"" hose. No problem there. It does not connect to the 5"" port on my delta dust collector, however. Unfortunate, but not a design flaw."
5,used for minimax FS30 jointer planer,"I bought two of these for my minimax fs30 jointer planer, which has a metric fitting slightly larger than 5"". Tapped this thing on tight with a plywood board and a mallet, works great, especially with the Jet 4"" quick disconnect fitting on my DC hoses. Suction is tight. Works just as I'd hoped, I ordered another one for the mortising attachment."
1,"Didn't fit my 5"" port on my Delta dust collector.","Didn't fit my 5"" port on my Delta dust collector.10 more words required. 10 more words required. 10 more words required."
1,Dosen't Fit,"This reducer does not fit into the back of the Delta Unisaw. Delta forgot mine on the initial purchase. 4 weeks later, I still don't have one."
1,a bargain for its usefulness,"considering that i already had purchased a woodstock 6"" to 1"" step reducer and that many dust collection main tubing is 4"" diameter, this reducer is the right complement because one can connect the 4"" main tubing to the dust collector through a 5"" hose. a big shot."
4,Nice Cable Tubing,"I recieved this cable tubing today, will be using it for my PC, to cover the power supply cables and make a clean and uniform appearance in my case. The cables are good quality, for the price the length is good about 8 ft. They come in plastic clamshell packaging so be careful you dont slice em when opening it. I subtracted a star from the product due to the fact it does not show what the heat resistance is for this tubing. It would have been nice to know the max temps it will handle before melting! Im sure it will work just fine for what I need it, and overall is a good product a nice color I ordered red. Shipping was fast."
5,my son watches this endlessly,I have a 2 year-old that is into Thomas in a BIG way and this is a perfect way to entertain him once in a while!
5,thomas movies,my 3 year old son loves these movies. he watches them over and over. the price was a good price for them. now we have to look for more thomas movies on amazon everyday.
4,Good movie,My son loves it so much. He watches this all the time. I have hard time to get him out of TV because I want him to play something else also.
4,Funny!,I bought this series during my maternity leave. I was introduced to Open All Hours by the local PBS channel. I totally enjoy this comedy and have added it to my British Comedy line-up. It is a classic and watching the old-way of grocery shopping has added to the joy of watching this series.
5,Fetch a cloth!,"Love it, love it, love it! Another gem by Roy Clarke marks British comedy at its finest, and very affordable."
4,Lots of laughs,"My wife and I always enjoy the English comedy's and ""Open All Hours"" is a favorite. Unfortunately, the channel that was showing it kept running the same segments. Having the entire series is great. If you enjoy ""Open All Hours"" this is a must have."
1,Open All Hours,"Couldn't wait to get this DVD. But what a disappointment!! Poorly written and poorly directed. Rarely is there a comedic moment you can even smile at! Nothing in the script supports the abilities of these actors. The series only succeeds in portraying the depression, sadness and grind of life and little hope in the North. I could barely get through the first disk before the whole thing went back in my stack of DVDs not to watch again. It left me wishing I'd spent my money on any thing else!!!"
1,Ghastly.,"This, of all the first two pages of 'British TV Series, each one of which is splendid!, is the only one of which is stupid, ghastly, sexist and insubstantial in every way."
2,No stick as indicated in the picture,"The keyboard shipped to me did not include the ""stick"" (purple dot located above the ""B"" key) as shown in the picture. At least it was clean and worked properly after installation."
2,A keyboard for MacGyver,"After doing some MacGyvering I was able to get this retched keyboard to fit in the space for which it obviously was intended but not designed for. But all is well that ends well, I made it work."
2,review,"the item was listed as fully functional almost new. turns out several of the keys were loose and the S key keeps falling off. otherwise, it's perfect."
5,Pure Genius......The Mecca Don Is Back,"I'll be the first to admit that Mecca & The Soul Brother was the only thing in my walkman during my sophomore of high school and after The Main Ingredient, I was one of those who were broken hearted by the split of CL and Pete Rock....however, this return by CL Smooth was well worth the wait. American Me has classic written all over it. The first track ""American Me"" is a hard hitting-in your face-bass thumping track...but once track 4 hit..""Call On Me""...I was sold....I have to steal a comment from another reviewer on this one....""It is reminiscent to ""Lots Of Love"" from Mecca & The Soul Brother with a beautiful chorus lacing CL's smoothed out flow. Of course, the Pete Rock produced ""It's A Love Thing"" is a perfect reunion for Mount Vernon's finest producer/MC duo. Personally, there isn't one flaw on this album. Classic in my book."
4,Please call it a comeback.,"C.L. is still walking the streets of New York (he was recently spotted at the vegetarian spot on 125th Street but bounced when he saw the line). There's something comforting to know some things about hip hop haven't changed. But I was not expecting to press play and hear what I heard, an originator with some original product, a creater of this game still creating cuts as smooth as what he gave us way back when. And he made me have to dig in the crates to find the right words to describe the production: dope beats. I never expected a resurrection like this. People, spread the word - it's a hip hop homecoming y'all!"
1,BEWARE - INACCURATE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"This battery is NOT the correct part for a T23. I can't attest to the other models. The battery may well replace the part numbers listed, but they are NOT the ones for a T23. I bought this item for my son, who lives in another city, knowing that he needed a battery for a T23. The battery delivered does not look like this one, and as I found out when I got the part number from my son, the ones listed here are not for a T23."
4,diffie looking kinda spiffy,"for your money it doesn't get any better than when joe diffie sings ""pickup man"", ""third rock from the sun"" (the themesong), ""junior's in love"" (a classic), and the most hillarious song's i've ever heard: ""good brown gravy"" (with the bass singer echoing the chorus) and ""the cows came home"" (what a statement). these songs bring back great memories from my senior year of high school which was a fun time. however, i don't think i'll ever be putting good brown gravy in my hair anytime soon!"
1,no cd,where is myitem i still have not recieved it and when i do i eill review it and not until then
3,ACTION ADVENTURE has a new POPPA !,"Starring:David Jackson and Greg Nutt.A Ray Etheridge classic ACTION flick.When Drive-Ins still ruled and VHS was a threat to TV,This film would have been the talk of the South !Filmed in Oregon ?,With Real Bullets,Real car crashes and real dynamite...Who could ever imagine happening on film ?Ray Etheridge is a different kind of filmmaker,We're not saying this film effort is the reason Ray and Migdalia moved to Florida,But think someone must have died filming at end.Seriously one of the best endings this side of `Night Of The Living Dead' shock finis.The bad guy,David Jackson,is still making movies.Greg Nutt,The helicopter pilot( YOU KNEW it had a helicopter),Flew on Magnum,P.I. and NCIS and JAG series !Again,The Etheridges deliver entertainment."
3,"Poorly documented, to use as encoder, you need additional parts!","First of all, when I buy some kit to assemble, I expect it to came with schematics and brief explanation how it works. In case with this one, you get only directions where to which part place and that's all. No internals schematics, no explanation how it works. If anyone wonders, how this thing works, it uses LM567 Tone DECODER IC. And yes, since this IC is only DECODER, to use it as ENCODER, as kit advertises, you need to soldier additional transistors, resistorc, etc. So, right out the box, you won't get ENCODER function.To be short, I bought pair of these, to use as encoder-decoder set, to send some commands over the wires. After looking into schematics, I've discovered that I'll need to soldier additional parts, which aren't in the kit. This is not a problem for me, but maybe problem for beginners."
1,THIS IS NOT RONNIE MONTROSE!!!!!!,"Well..here's another perfect example of an album by some complete unknown...using a famous moniker to sell some lame ass BS....THIS IS NOT ROCK MUSIC and is NOT Ronnie Montrose..I think the intent was to mislead people into thinking it was the famous guitarist and then after they wasted their money.....OOPS....SURPRISE, SURPRISE!!Where did this guy get off referring to his album as ""Montrose""???? I think it was intentional...It didn't work on me.....never bought it"
4,Rick James has the touch,"Rick James wrote&produced the jams for this group.but the Mary Jane Girls have there own style and were able to find themselves and earn their Respect.In My House,Candy Man,Wild&Crazy Love etc.. the trademark Stone City Band sound is in effect."
2,"Good information, but a difficult read","This book is packed with a lot of information that lays out a detailed process for managing product innovation. However, the book is very repetitive and difficult to read. The book is loaded with tables and diagrams, but the diagrams are confusing (even though the author identifies them as simplified). A little more effort by the author to improve the readability of this book would make it a very valuable resource."
3,Good book,"I liked this book. I thought the story was pretty cool. I also don't think you have to be 9-12 years old to enjoy this book. I'm 15 and I liked it. I've learned that it's not about the difficulty of the book but the plot, and it doesn't matter what other people think as long as you like it."
4,Who really talks like that???,"Ok, this was a good book. I enjoyed it a lot. It had ample action, and the story ran smooth.My one complaint about this book is the dialogue. I'm not sure who the author's modeled the characters after, but I have to say that they were not normal. Nobody teenager talks like that, especially 14 year old white girls from MA. The dialogue was completely inrealistic.Barring that one complaint, this was a very good book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Buffy or that sort of thing."
4,Great Start!,"The Power of Two is a great start to an interesting series. The twins come from very different worlds, forced together through tragedy, mystery, and magick. The authors did a great job in crafting two very unique and interesting main characters. The series promises to slowly divulge the answers to the mysteries of the twins' biological parents, their magickal heritage, and the purpose for their being brought together at last. The series makes a valiant, and often hilarious, attempt to mimick teen slang. Even when they miss, it proves entertaining for readers. The magick is more Harry Potter than Wicca, but the series makes up for that lack of realism by portraying the everyday struggles of teenage life convincingly. A great series about compromise, friendship, and confidence."
2,Trying too hard!,"I've read this first book from the series and I find it is not all it's cranked up to be. The authors try too hard in using common ""slang"" terms, and most of the time just end up confusing the reader. The plot is a bit chiched however it is a good plot line to follow and it helps the reader interest in reading the book. I would recomend it for pre-teens 11-14, but nothing older than that because it would bore the teen mind. However, if you find yourself desperated and in the wait for a new good book, like Harry Potter, for instance, read it just for fun and check it out of your public library. It's not worth buying the book!"
3,glaring errors,"While this series is admittedly addicting and fun to read, one begins to notice some awful mistakes. There are typos and inconsistencies between the books that a sophisticated reader will notice and be bothered by. The authors may have good storylines, but they do not present them as well as they could have."
1,Don't read this,"This book is not worth reading. It has a sappy plot, the dialogue sounds unnatural, and half the book is made up of descriptions of the characters clothes. As a teenager, I get enough of that every time I go to school. When I read this book I can almost see a blond cheerleader at the typewriter. The characters are exaggerated stereotypes. The perfect middle class girl and her degenerate, jaded twin sister. The author's clumsy attempts at making the characters endearing left me gagging."
1,Not satisfied at all,"I have specifically ordered ""Classic Desserts"" and suprizingly from Amazon I got another titled as ""Life's Uncertain Eat Desserts First"". As it is not what I have orderd and as I still want what I have ordered, sending me the right one will be the right appoarch and I am demanding recieving it."
2,"nothing new, sophmoric premise and solutions","This book is based on a premise that has been around since parenting ""This generation is going to hell in a hand basket due to X change"". It then uses scare tactics including examples of gross substance abuse and untimely death to pull the reader in. The solutions of ""spend quality time with your kids and as a family"" are just as obvious as the problem given in the first place. To top it off, the book lumps and stereotypes current and past generations. One example in the book states that previous generations loved school because it freed them from menial chores while the current generation dislikes school because it's harder work than is expected of them around the house. The authors must assume that all parents / readers are ignorant of history, lack personality traits, and have no innate parenting intuition."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"Upon recommendation for the principal from my school, I purchased this book and am participating in a parent-lead book club. It is WONDEFUL! ALL PARENTS MUST READ THIS BOOK! It's an easy to read, easy to comprehend, and extremely enlightening!!! Reading this book could change your family!Raising Self-Reliant Children in a Self-Indulgent World: Seven Building Blocks for Developing Capable Young People"
3,Reminders for raising your kids,I am lukewarm on this book. Nothing was earth shattering but more reminders of information we already know. It read like a textbook.
4,Good book for parents and teachers,This is a good read for teachers and parents looking to help their students and kids be more independent and reliable in a world that is showing them otherwise.
1,"Eh, it's nothing special...","the book didn't really give any information that was particularly unknown. it seemed very simple. stuff that everyone already knows how to do. it was a complete waste of money, i could've wrote this book..."
5,that is useful,the book starts from basic knowledge. it is very useful. some content is over what I expected.
2,Not that great.,While it covers a broad spectrum of information it's very very basic in content. I was expecting to find things to spice up sex life a bit but was disappointed as almost everything discussed was either common sense or something one would come across naturally over time.I will suggest it to 35 year old virgins or teens who are just beginning to explorer.
2,Maybe a good beginner book?,"Its got the basics, but holds something to be desired for the more seasoned crowd."
5,An excellent introduction for beginners,"I bought this book for my younger brother who was getting embarrassed asking me questions. I flipped through a number of similar titles at the bookstore, trying to choose the best one. This book is detailed, yet tasteful, educational, yet light. I read a good deal of it, and I can't say I learned much, but it is a great book for beginners."
4,Covers Just about everything!!,"I think the book was an interesting read with funny artsy visualizations! Some folks just don't have a clue, others want to know MORE. This book will satisfy both types. I read the ebook (acrobat PDF) version of the book with all the same stuff as paper. ..."
4,Very well done!!!!,"I will keep this short.This is a good book. It goes into detail about ""almost"" everything about sex.Here is a list of things she goes into in the book in good detail.Female problemsMale problemspositonsmale and female ""private part"" sizesdatingbirth controlseductionfour playtoysThese are just a few of the things she goes over. It is a good book. Get it."
4,Nice watch,Very sporty in a nice way. Watch has hook and loop clsoure which is easy to put on ans snugs nicelu to the wrist. One day it didn't keep time accurately--maybe the battery is going dead. I wonder how long these sit before being sold.
3,It's a little old and a little limited.,"This edition was printed back in the 1950s. A lot has changed since the Cold War. And while it is a quality book compared to Romanov's dictionary, it has a much more limited vocabulary than Romanov's. It don't recommend it unless you think Romanov's is illegible and you can't find a better dictionary."
2,"shame on you, record company!",Put out the single without the Gabriel & Dresden remix? You've gotta be kidding me. And the Satoshi Tomiie remix was hot too. Both weren't included on the single. OUCH.
2,A little disappointing,"Maybe her heyday has gone, Fallen is definitely a smaller hit than its predecessors like Adia, Angel, Sweet Surrender. If Fallen were to be released in her last album it would've become a filler. I've had great expecatations of Sarah and I really got indulged in her Adia and Angel, but again, Fallen is a little disappointing. BTW, yes you can in fact remove the copy controlled thing by pressing (and not letting go) of your shift key right after you've put the CD into the player. That will not only let you burn the CD, but also the software will not intrusively occur in front of you."
2,Not quite the same.......,"These cones do not produce the same scent as the sticks. I am unsure of why this is so different but it clearly is. Logically, the cones should be the same color as the sticks since dhoop is just incense without the stick but they arn't. They are a dark black with brown dust. THis color is starkly different from the light grey of Nag Champa. The unlit scent is also quite stronger and at times offensive if you take too long a whiff. While I am unsure of what these smell like, it is surely not nag champa. STICK WITH THE STICKS"
3,Doesn't smell like their Nag Champa sticks,"The biggest issue I have with these are there combustibility. They often go out less than half way through...other than that they have a distinctly different smell then the Nag Champa sticks. Not a problem, just very different"
3,Strictly for the Renaissance drama specialist!,"I am the long-forgotten British author of this obscure edition, but thrilled to see it on the internet even if out of print! The play itself is rubbish, but I needed something different for my thesis. My footnotes are quite humorous. I'd love to hear from anyone who reads this. Over the years the book has made me a few dollars - too few ever to make it worth cashing the cheque from my publishers!"
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,I've never ordered anything and been this disappointed. I ordered two of these and both didn't work. I contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it. I tried contacting Ritz Camera where I purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund. I am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support. I will never buy another product from this company again.
1,Don't bother,"Ignore all the glowing comments on this product. Resolution is TERRIBLE, even for fully cropped mug-shots of just a person's face. You have to hold the device at arms length just to make out some images since they are so blurry any closer. Save your money on this one."
4,"Small, Expensive, BUT good!","I just got one of these to give my wife for Christmas. After opening it up, I had the software installed and was downloading pics to the keychain in minutes. Very easy to use and understand. Pictures loaded with no problems and no need to be cropped. Holds around 55 pics. Pics I loaded show up very well on the keychain screen despite its small size.NOTE: The rechargable battery in the photo album is charged from your USB port while you are searching through your pictures. Battery didn't take very long to charge. Due to the small screen, photos with close-ups look the best when downloaded to keychainSo far, battery seems to last quite a while between chargings."
2,"Identical to device sold under the ""Argus"" brand","This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called ""Smartparts"" is identical to one sold by ""Argus."" Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support. You buy this, you're on your own. You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty. Don't pay more. Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive. If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo. But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy. Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.-- mm"
3,"Good, but not great","Delivers exactly what is promised but not a speck more. Once one figures it out, its very easy to use. However, the ""user manual"" is useless. Picture quality is mediocre. Good value, but don't epect too much."
3,A satisfying Western..with surprisingly modern themes,"Henry Wilson Allen's first book as Clay Fisher ""Red Blizzard"" is a surprisingly modern western(written circa 1950). It tells of a biracial(Native American and White) Army scout named John Perez, and his attempt to save the Army from a massive confederacy of Nations led by Crazy Horse and Red Cloud. The Native Americans are not treated one-dimensionally here, they may be the ""villians"", but they are portrayed as honorable warriors in the ending, while the Army is portrayed as flawed and stocked with racists and blowhards, but they also are treated as honorable. The ending is gritty, and appropriate. A hidden treasure. Fisher's treatment of racism is the biggest plus here, he was ahead of his time."
1,Bad Business,This seller has failed to contact me and my stuff has not been received 2 weeks after it was supposed to be here. Do Not Buy From Them
3,Needs more tangerine..,"This is a strongly scented Yankee candle, but not quite as tangerine like as I had hoped when I ordered it. This one is more on the Berry side. I would purchase again if it wasn't quite so berry scented. This one has fairly decent sillage, enough for a medium size room."
1,Awful,"Granted, I'm not by any means a fan of space rock, but this is just awful. I'm sure there is a fan base out there for the piercing synths and annoying lyrics, but it doesn't really sit well with me. If you are looking for something different to listen to, as I was, bypass this one. If you like this kind of music, hey, more power to you, but if you are unsure of space rock, don't start here."
1,Re-release on DVD,"Cover art matches the Gundam UC Blu Ray number 3. From the back cover, the same special features apply except for BluRay Live. If you don't have a blu-ray player, this version will suffice"
4,Good fun strums,This dvd shows some fun strums some easy some alot more advanced a little something for everyone.A good dvd if you already have one of the beginner dvds.
5,Beginning Ukulele,"Overall, good quality. To enjoy, should have a good knowledge of uke chords; he goes through the sections pretty fast, so you can't be slowed down by figuring how to play a chord. Many strums are taught, worth the money and knowledge."
4,Excellent DVD,I found Essential Strums to be an excellent resource. The various strum pateerns were presented in a clear and informative manner. The DVD was just a bit pricey but worth the money overall.
2,Call a priest,"It is possesed. We have named ours Christine. We have had nothing but problems with this printer and the oversize paper feed tray. It is totally inconsistent and erratic in terms of when the paper feed jams and it needs constant babysitting. It chooses to jam at will and nobody can figure out the rationale for its behavior. We have sent the printer back twice and gotten refurbished ones, to no avail. I would never recommend this printer to anyone who needed to print anything important or in a timely manner. A terrible choice for a business printer, in my opinion, just because it is unreliable. It's good points are the color quality and image quality- they are pretty good. We haven't had the ink hog problem."
1,No Wide Format for Win 7,"Well, HP decided ""limited functionality"" was fine for an expensive, business-class printer. Do not buy this thinking it will work with Win 7 - it only prints 8.5 x 11, since they will not update the driver. My main workaround is keeping an older computer just to transfer files to so I can print. No more HP printers!!!"
1,Dreadful paper feed an poor drivers,"On the plus side this printer can handle A3 paper, large ink reservoirs and has a duplex printing option.On the negative side it very frequently jams when feeding from the optional second tray, is very slow when printing duplex and now the paper feed from the main tray has totally failed. In addition the drivers are poor and of the 3 supplied only one seems at all reliable; except under Vista where it repeatedly forgets the options fitted and your personal settings. Its worth noting that HP have never updated the drivers since release so I suppose even they have given up on this printer.Avoid at all costs. If you spec it for your office it will cause you embarrassment for years as all your colleagues curse whilst removing a succession of jams."
3,Wide Format Printers,"It's good, but NOISY!!! Clak, clak, clak. It can't compare to the HP Color Inkjet Printer CP1700."
4,Quiks music always gets 5 stars but this is for the set list,"I had no idea this thing existed! As a Quik fan I had to check it out. The Platinum & Gold Collections usually have a few hits . This holds true for DJ Quik Platinum & Gold Collection. It has the album singles ""Born and Raised In Compton,"" ""Tonight,"" ""Jus Lyke Compton,"" ""Way Too Fonky,"" and all. Something about this set just seemed cheap to me. If you want a Quik collection check out ""The Best of DJ Quik-Da Finale."" It has a lot more songs and seems more complete. This set had a few odd songs like ""The Ho In You,"" versus a more popular classic-""Sweet Black P***y."""
1,lousy.....,"I could not get it to work at all !So i went to the shop ""Five and below"" and bought one for 5 bucks which works great"
4,cheapest way to get your ipod mini to work in a car! by far,best device ever made to play your music in any car with an ipod mini!
4,Griffin iTrip Mini works great,"I have owned a Griffin iTrip Mini for about 5 years, and most of the time it worked fine. The only thing is that since it is an FM Transmitter, sometimes there is interference when the signal is weak. Also, my previous iTrip broke down after almost 4 years of use (the metal mini jack broke), and that's the reason why I had to replace it. Luckily, it was only $4.99 at Amazon."
2,Poor quality,"The only way to play your iPod in your car and have decent sound is to have it hooked directly to the stereo. FM transmitters in general are poor. I tried this one, and learned this myself. As you are driving the quality is constantly changing as the signal changes - terrible."
2,Good...at first,"I bought this product when it first came out and it worked but never had a clear sound. There was always static on every available station and always had to be touching it. Currently, I have not used it in months because it won't pick up ANY station at all. Very disappointed. I am in the process of purchasing a different product."
2,Good idea. Poor product.,"Make sure you are able to return this product. It seems to work for some people, and others it doesn't. I followed the instructions, and got a clear channel, but the static was incredible. I could barely hear my music. I returned it within days.Another con is that it uses a special kind of song to change the channel. This means you will not be able to use the shuffle feature for all your songs, because sometimes these special frequency changer songs will pop up into your music."
1,WARNING: THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP,"I love my iPod because all my music is in one place. And so I wanted to accesorise the iPod so I bought a case and the iTrip FM transmiter because it was $16 and I chose it because it was the cheapest thing there. BIG mistake. My mom gives me good advice and she says do not buy something just because it is cheap, buy it because it is good. I should have listened because instead of getting the ciggarette lighter adapter that my friends have and say it works I bought the cheap piece of crap. This transmitter does not work well at all there is static and I followed all the directions and nothing works. I envy the people who got theirs to work, because mine wont."
3,Nice but has issues,iTrip works like it says but as mentioned before if you live in a city with a large number of radio stations it may be hard to find a clear station for listening. Would be helpful if it could be used on AM stations. It also has issues with volume control - some songs are louder than others so sound must be adjusted which can be tricky if driving.
5,Great Product,Works great! As long as you follow the suggestions (as in not having your volume all the way up on your iPod) it is excellent! I would have to suggest not leaving it plugged into your iPod when you are not using it. Doing so caused my iTrip to malfunction. It was replaced and I have not had any problems since! It does drain your iPod battery really fast though...
4,Almost love it...,"I think the iTrip is great for the iPod Mini. It plays straight out of the box, its wireless, and the sound is good.A lot of people are saying it doesnt work, but it depends on where you live. In Savannah, it worked straight out of the box. I expect to have some issues with it when I get back to Atlanta, tho. If you cant get it to work on any station, I suggest buying the cassette adapter.The only thing I dont like is that it drains your battery. I cant even get 3 hours out of a full charge on my Mini. Get a car charger."
3,Not good when moving,"I purchased this with the intent of using in the car but found it hard to maintain a constant strong signal while driving. I do not live in a big city and there are several unused channels available to use in this area with the transmitter. Strongly do not recommend this if you are purchasing to use in the car!However, it works fantastic next to a motionless fm radio in the backyard for grilling and outdoor events."
1,Do not buy this!!,"I never got it to work. It is a pain, you have to load all the stations as ""songs"". I spent 3 unsuccessful hours trying it with 4 different radios, several stations...I got a Monster ICarPLay and had it working in 1 minute!!"
2,Too much hassle,"This is a great idea for those who live in the country... but for those of us who live in the city, it just doesn't work.The FM transmitter required an unused radio frequency in order to transmit it's signal. Otherwise, if you try to use a frequency that is alreay in use by a radio station, the signals will conflict.Driving around in a large metropolitin area, where there are hundreds of radio stations, I could never keep a clear signal."
4,NOT for big city driving...,"I bought this item to play the music from an iPod mini over the car radio for a 1000 mile road trip. I set my radio to the 87.something FM station the instructions recommended. Once we were out of the range of Los Angeles area broadcasting, the thing worked like a champ all the way to Santa Fe, NM. In order to appreciate how this thing works, you do have to have a basic understanding of radio wave physics. Even if you don't..just understand that a crowded FM band will not allow ""clean"" play...there's just too much noise. If you live or travel outside major metropolitan areas, this is the device for you. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I've only had it in use for under 20 hours. I don't see why it would stop working, though, because it draws it's power from the iPod itself."
2,I also want to like it,"But there's a reason it's on sale. It doesn't work very well. Sound quality isn't that good, not too easy to set up either. I gave mine away to a friend, wouldn't suggest buying it."
1,Worst product ever?,"I had an ipod for about a year that I use to listen to in my truck using a cassette adapter. Everything was peachy until I bought a new car that didn't have a cassette player. So, I made the mistake of buying the iTrip to compensate. At first, the iTrip seemed to work OK, but it sometimes needed to be reset. That was on the first day. On the second day the iTrip was even more sensitive and required more resetting. On the third day it had to be reset every other second and refused to work in some parts of town. Then it just quit working all together. In a misguided belief it wasn't connected properly, I pushed down on the top of the iTrip gently exploiting a weakness I wasn't aware of in my ipod mini's headphone jack. It took me a few days to realize that my iPod was now broke and pretty much useless to me. So, not only did the iTrip not work, it caused my $250 dollar iPod to brake just as it's warranty ran out. Avoid the iTrip and the iPod like the plague."
1,Horrible,"I've tried this with several radios, and all of them either didn't work at all, or were so awful and staticy it made the transmitter worthless. In our Prius, we had to actually old the ipod up near the roof to hear anything at any frequency. What a complete waste of money."
2,You don't need it,"Get the other iTrip, the one with the exact same headphone thing except it doesn't say ""iPod Mini"" on it. Save yourself money."
1,Don't waste your time with this.,"It broke after 3 uses, and I tried to install the software, but you need iTunes, but the only problem is that iTunes WILL NOT WORK with my ipod. Totallly useless! It sounded bad even when it did work."
2,It was nice while it lasted,"Okay, first off, I loved this product! It worked, for the most part, flawlessly and I was able to enjoy my ipod everywhere. However, after about 6 months of enjoyment, it broke! So I bought another one and a few months later, it broke too! I tried using the support page online and that didn't work either. So now I am sad because I can no longer utilize my ipod to its fullest extent. I have thought about buying another one because it is one of the cheapest transmitters out there, but I hesitate because they just don't last."
3,Good up to certain places,"One good thing is that this little device does its job under certain circumstances. If you live in an area where cell phone and any other large concentration of radio towers and sattelite dishes, rest assure that you'll get more static than your radio. But once out of these area, it will work just fine. Also iTrip does suck up energy pretty quick so get ready to get a charger... Would have chosen a simple cassette adaptor it's much more reliable and consume less power from iPod."
3,Poor Sound Quality,"I was really excited when I heard about this product, but once I got it the excitement faded. The sound quality is poor. At times all I can hear is a lot of static and I have to move the IPod around in order to get better reception."
2,i Trip for Ipod Mini,"Not thrilled with the interactivity, of the product, when changing FM frequencies. The ipod has to be extremely close to the radio for clear reception."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This ONLY works where there is little radio traffic. If you live anywhere half-populated, this will only frustrate. HOWEVER, on a recent road trip I experimented with a friends' iTrip (the kind that attaches to the bottom port) and it works on the Mini too. Not only that, it works SUPER WELL even in Los Angeles -- although it is a bit of a battery drain. As always, remember to keep your iPod volume at 50 to 70% for proper reception -- any higher and the iTrip will distort."
3,i Skip,"Frustrating to use. Weak transmitter signal means that unit doesn't work well in certain vehicles. Difficult to change settings when driving (don't do this... i Trip can be a major distraction while driving!). O.K. for home use, but iPod has to sit next to stereo system. For car, get cassette adapter. Best for home use. Although the procedure for setting the frequency signal is easy, it is also easy to forget."
3,Works good in the middle of nowhere.,"Don't even contemplate buying this item if you live in a semi developed area. Pretty much useless unless you love static induced music. It does work extremely well if you use it with a portable radio in close proximity or if your cars' radio antenna is in the windshield and you can get your iPod extremely close to it. Otherwise, they just don't have the transmitting power to overcome all the crappy radio staions out there that bleed over into supposedly empty frequencies. I bought mine primarily for use with my portable radio when I go camping, the backyard or the beach.. For that it works awesome."
4,Great for road trips and home use!,"I bought this right before moving from Chicago to the east coast, and it has been a wonderful little addition to my iPod Mini. It didn't really work too well in the car when I was still in Chicago, but that wasn't surprising, given the crowded airwaves. It worked well in my apartment with my boombox radio, however, and once I was on the road and out of the city, I had a 1,000 song mix tape to keep me company. I currently live in an area without overly crowded airwaves, and the iTrip works great both in the car and at home. Obviously, the sound quality is the same as if you were listening to these songs on the radio, but I'm not an audiophile, so it's fine for me!"
3,iTrip mini is sorta ok,"It does what they say it will. Once you understand the process of loading the istations and then figuring out which ones to use and which ones to get rid of so they don't play in your song rotation, you will be alright. The sound quality is pretty good. I am not sure if it is the quality of the file as some sounded better then others via my car and home stereo's or if it is the iTrip. It does seem to suck the battery life though. Will need a charger in the car. Doesn't plug in if you have a Speck Skin on your ipod. I think it will be nice to use on long trips or if I want to make my ipod portable with friends stereo's. I did get a RCA cable and this direct connection method sounds better-as it should. iTrip, not a bad product, just not totally impressed.Chuck Mc."
5,Essential Product,"I first had doubts when buying this product because of people saying about the quality of the sound. After getting a gift certificate for amazon i decided it was now or never.It got delivered literally seconds before i was about to go biking about 45 min away with my friend. We configured the iTrip in minutes, a very simple process outlined by graphical images.Jumped in the car, scanned the stations, i used the default 87.9. At first it was staticy when i tried keeping it in the dashboard compartment, so i clipped it on the side door and it worked flawlessly. No static whatsoever. Was better then cd quality for me, and i played it at 100% volume. I also tried keeping it on my dashboard and it still worked great. Notice i don't live in a big city so that might explain my success but for now, i would recommend this product to anyone, and would classify it as an essential."
1,bad idea,The i trip looks great...but is more annoying than any thing.. an a recent 5 hr road trip my ipod/itrip had to be reprogramed so many times while driving it became annoying and dangerous distracting me driving. the reprograming wasn't from radio interference but rather THE ITRIP WOULD JUST STOP WORKING! Avoid this purchase unless you like being distracted while driving.
4,Good Deal,"It works fine... I`ve been having a little bit of problems for it to catch a station, but once it does, it works fine, with a bit of interference every now and then, but overall, it`s a good deal... Besides, it`s way cheaper than the ones sold in stores!"
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this so I could listen to my iPod in my car in the city. The first couple of times, it worked great, but after that, something happened. It just wouldn't work. All I heard was static, no matter what frequency I tried this on. I have yet to take a road trip with it, so maybe that will work better, but right now, I am not happy with the product. Maybe the fact that I live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it, but it used to work on some frequencies, and now it just doesn't anymore. I am very disappointed."
1,Sound quality sucks,"iTrip has cool design, but the sound quality is tereible and not even up to par with an AM station. I am really disappointed and will have to look for other in-car solutions."
2,This is junk,"My experience seems to be different than many others. Basically this is a very cheap piece of junk. It works much of the time, but I suspect you won't find it easy to change stations and you're susceptible to interference at any time. I also found that it would simply change frequencies for no apparent reason. I finally broke down and bought an inexpensive in-dash CD player with an auxillary input and just run that to the ipod. It works way better and it's just not as hard or as expensive as you might think.Otherwise, if this is your only option, go for it."
1,Thumbs Down,The product is just not worth the money. The quality is poor does not work well in the car or at home.
4,Very satisfied,"I have found the FM transmitter to be superior to the casette tape because there's no casette noise to deal with (which is quite noticeable in my car). I find the sound quality to be no different than the radio. Friends have found it midly annoying that when travelling across country you need to constantly look for a new ""dead"" station if the frequency is used by the locals. But for my purposes of driving to and from work it's great and spares me from the mindless morning DJs. For me, that is worth the price alone."
2,Drove me to Drink,"I hated this thing. I hated connecting to a station. I almost drove off the side of the road on long trips when I had to change stations. And, even when I found one the sound quality was mediocre at best. I just didn't use my iPod in my car unless I could use the tape deck attachment (who has a tape deck anymore?). In my new car (MINI Cooper) I paid $150 to have an Apple dock installed directly into the stereo. VERY WORTH it - although almost as expensive as the iPod... The sound quality is incredible, the stereo controls change the songs and the playlists, it charges at the same time and is located in the (air conditioned) glove box. I am so glad I don't have to use an FM transmitter again. Bottom line - get your car hard-wired if you can."
1,Woefully underwhelming radio tuner,"The Griffin iTrip Mini for the Ipod Mini is a quite a disappointment. Originally, I had hoped to have the ability to listen to my Ipod Mini over the radio and enjoy the great music I have on it. Alas, when I used it, I only was able to listen to it on the default frequency, 87.9, first and was profoundly disappointed by the static-laden sound quality that came out of the radio. Honestly, I've gotten better sound out of an old portable AM radio. Sure, there seem to be ways to program it to access other stations and hopefully get better sound quality, but I've spoken to others who say that they get equally bad sound quality on other stations. Sometimes, it doesn't even work at all. It's just simply not worth it. It should also be noted that the radio station files emit and unpleasant sound when you come across them in the Ipod Mini's shuffle rotation (why are they even in the playlist files????). I took mine back to the Apple store to get other accessories."
1,Just stops working!,"Ok. This is the 2nd ipod mini transmitter I have purchased that has broken within a month. All of a sudden it just stops working, for no apparent reason. Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk."
2,High Maintenance,"After much anticipation, I finally purchased the wireless transmitter. Much to my dismay, the little thing is entirely too difficult and needy. When in the house, I had to place the iPod on top of the stereo in order to lessen, not eliminate, the static. Furthermore, it was hopeless when placed in the car. The overall sound quality is poor compared to the sound that comes directly out of the headphones. Perhaps there is too much interference in a big city for the thing to work properly, but I really don't think it is worth purchasing the little guy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I got this when I got my ipod mini. The product worked fine for one day. I tryed to use it today in my car, and the static was all I could hear. This device also drains the battery. I ended up returning the I trip for the Belkin tune cast II, The Belkin works much better."
2,"Great in theory, not in practice","I bought one of these with high hopes of getting iPod music in my car, but it did not work. No matter where I tuned it, static drowned out my music. In Los Angeles where I am, there is no open spectrum, so no matter what FM frequency you choose for the Griffin, the transmitter has to compete with radio stations signals in your area - and it always loses. The signal transmitted from this device is very weak and has to reach your car antenna (it does no good sticking this thing close to your stereo). So if your car antenna is at the rear of your car, it's not going to make it. This might work if it is placed right next to the antenna, within one meter maybe.The whole theory of broadcasting music over an FM frequency fails in practice unless you live in an area where there are portions of the FM band that are totally unoccupied. Even then, it's a mediocre solution at best."
1,Piece of crap,"I had similar products of these FM transmitters from 5 years ago. It was filled with static back then. I thought the technology surely would have improved since 5 years ago but I was disappointed once again. My suggestion, spend your money on other accessories."
2,Good if you like AM radio!!!,"What a cool design I thought! Griffin seems to be the leader when it comes to accessorizing my Ipod. I had to buy two when they came out. Unfortunately you learn that being the first isn't always the best. Great design horrible sound! My AM radio sounds far superior. Works ok at my office, sitting close to my radio.Hopefully they'll do better on their SMART DECK. Great concept but again I placed my order in February and haven't even seen the product yet. They claimed it would ship in the third quarter and when I emailed the first of September they couldn't give me a ship date. Caveat emptor"
4,Awesome,Not only did this product live up to my expectations... but the price right here at Amazon is the absolute BEST!!! The product produces clear sound. I'm very happy with it.
1,Suddenly stops working,I've owned two of these and both stopped working about 40 days after purchase. I tried everything on online forums and at griffin's website to no avail. Neither were damaged but they refused to transmit. I recently bought a similar product by iRiver that charges itself from your cigarette lighter jack and noticed the signal was stronger than iTrip's. The interface is easier to use too and you don't have to fumble with playlists trying not to accidentally reset the transmitting station like you do with iTrip.
2,Best for rural users,I live in a very crowded area in which a black radio station is hard to find. Even when I did find a station that sounded like it was void of talk and music I found that the music that came from my iPod had a lot of static and made listening hard. Needless to say I returned it. I would recommend this if you live in an area where you can actually find a blank station.
2,Good in Theory?,"The Griffin iTrip is super small and good in Theory. In my vehicle it works very well, and I like that there are sooo many options for different radio stations. If you only want to use this item in your vehicle, then this is a great item!The sound is not as clear as most people would like, bit too much static for my taste. If you are picky, Monster Cable iCarPlay iPod Wireless FM Transmitter is the BEST I've found, but only useful in the car!If you are looking to use this on just any radio, then you must have a good antennae, if you don't have a good antennae your sound will be CRAP. I have tried this transmitter on 5 different radios at work... everything from a boombox to an expensize surroundsound system. It all comes down to the antennae!!!I will keep this product, but only for a back-up!"
1,"looks cool, works horribly","This is the best-looking and seemingly easiest fm transmitter, but I have tried every station in the city and have not found one that works without static. Even when this thing has worked at its best, static can still be heard very loudly. The only time I have ever gotten this thing to work well is when I actually touched the antenna from a stereo to the itrip. I would not recomend this at all to anybody."
3,"It works, but not the best quality","I received this as a promotional offer. It works fine, but the sound quality is poor, maybe at the sound quality of a radio station. I assumed that the quality would be similar and I am not disappointed in the product. I would suggest a cassette adaptor. I purchased one and it has almost CD quality sound."
3,Transmitter worthy by Location,"I don't know if it's the iTrip or the radio frequency in my area, but I get too much static, no clear signal so far in my location in and around the San Fernando Valley, in CA. I bought this product because I was going to be travelling to FL, it works well over there in the default radio station 87.9, clear sound and everything. But ever since I came back to CA, the default radio frequency gets other stations interfering so the transmition is interrupted. Other than that, I like it. So, buy this at your own risk. And if anybody is familiar with my area and knows of a much clearer station please say something, Good Luck!"
1,In big cities this doesn't work,"My suggestion is that if you have a cassette player buy the cassette audio tape. If you have no other option then this is really your only choice. However, don't expect it to work well in a large city. In Minneapolis it is impossible to find a good station. Outside of Minneapolis it has worked great, so if you live in a rural or small town it should be fine."
5,Highly Recommend,"I recently bought the mini itrip with mixed emotions from the reviews: some loved it and others hated it. I<br />, my self, soon learned to love it and it's the most valuable investment I have yet to make for my iPOD mini. Not only do I get good reception on the preset channel but mostly anything that there is barely anything on works. The only negative, for me, was that you have to add the iTrip stations through iTUNES. I used to use realplayer to add music and when I added it through iTUNES, it deleted EVERYTHING and I had to re add what I had left in my computer. Overall, very good idea to purchase."
1,how about ZERO STARS...,"Terrible... Although finding an open frequency is tough in Dallas, I think the iTrip's signal strength is the problem. I have an exterior antenna ('94 Ford Explorer), and the sound quality is only halfway bearable if I put the iPod/iTrip on the corner of the dashboard as close to the windshield and antenna as possible. I've switched to a cassette adapter and am MUCH happier with it. Please don't be fooled by the four- and five-star reviews - these must be from people who are too ashamed to admit they bought such a piece of garbage!"
3,So so,"I have had this for over a week now, I hate this. I loved the music quality on Ipod so I decide to buy this one so that I can listen to Ipod in car.It has always had static errrr... sound. It distracts you too much. May be I live in DC Metro area and we hardly have any un used frequency, but it sucks big time, needs the Volume adjustment(read tuning) everytime.. I have decided to take it off the Car."
3,"Good Idea, Fun to Use, Bad Sound","It was cool having the iPod floating magically in front of my console, but ultimately the FM transmitter just doesn't sound that great. Compressing the MP3 and then compressing it AGAIN to FM radio causes a lot of staticky sounds on certain music, especially Hip-Hop/R&B, Metal, Hard Rock, etc -- most anything that has a heavy guitar riff or deep bass. Also, the lighter-attached ""arm"" sometimes causes pops as it loses connection with the lighter socket when you hit bumps in the road."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I would strongly recommend you NOT buy this --- contrary to the rave reviews you will see on this site.I have a Honda CRV and the unless I place the ipod on the dash next to the antenna, I have no reception. Like most people you would want to keep in on a console or in a cup holder, well that won't work with this. Also, tuning the iTrip is close to impossible, unless you pause the song at just the right moment, it moves to the next station. There just has to be a better way.I wish I could return this, but after paying return shipping and Amazon's restock fee, it isn't worth it."
1,Don't buy,"Despite the bad critique that caused me some alarm I bought the griffin itrip. First of all it does not work almost at all on my sony mp70 in my car. I have to stick it on the mp3 player to get some poor quality broadcast. If I leave it anywhere else (on a seat, or on the dashboard) the radio doesn't receive anything at all. I have not checked it in rural areas but I don't think there will be much of a difference since the signal seems to be too weak. So save your money to buy something else..."
3,Sound Quality: Best; Broadcast Strength: Poor,"I just got the iTrip Mini yesterday and when I was testing out, it was great on the empty radio stations around where I live, but when you have a next door neighbor who likes to blast their music throughout their house and towards their neighbors at 2am in the morning, (and this is just an example, although several times this has happened to me) it's not really useful if you walk away about 6 inches with your iPod. If you set your iTrip to a popular radio station, it'll work in the car, or when you set your iPod/iTrip on top of the radio at home/work, but when you have the iPod 6 inches away, it'll go back to the popular station. Overall, the sound quality is the best I've heard, although the transmitter isn't that powerful."
2,I WANT to like it... but...,"The itrip mini does what it advertizes: fits the sleek lines of the mini ipod without adding much bulk at all, and transmits your tunes to a radio tuned to frequency (defaults to 87.9, but you can adjust that by installing the simple software provided with the itrip).Living in LA, there are VERY limited options insofar as stations not in use. 87.9 is actually one of the few options. The sound quality was awful. I tried using this device in my car, in my room, in my home stereo - all with the same lousy results.I should have listened to the advice of the salesperson at the Apple store and gotten the cassette device to play my ipod music on other sound systems.Bottomline: it works, but sounds like music playing on a radio station that doesn't quite come in clearly - static. Poor volume, and very poor sound quality."
2,Barely Functions As Specified,"I was overly excited to have bought this product. Not only would I not need to purchase a separate head unit that plays MP3 files, but I wouldn't need to burn music CDs anymore. Well, IF this iTrip thing would function properly. Griffin says that you get the best sound quality on a station that has nothing but static. You won't find many living in L.A. Once you do, however, there is so much static that you hear during songs that aren't very loud. Louder songs will mask the static. i.e. a slow love song versus rock. Not only that, and I don't know if this is just a defect of my iTrip, after a couple of songs, the intended radio frequency will take over and shut my iTrip out. Its not my volume level because I'm not even touching the player. Nothing but disappointment for a product I very much wanted to enjoy and give a good review for."
3,Exactly what I expected,"I've read all the horrible reviews for this, but honestly, I've had FM Transmitters before for my CD player and this quality was exactly what I expected. Yes, you get some static sometimes, but I found if I leave it in my lap and use myself as an antenna, the quality is fine. I didn't expect it to be perfect, because it's wireless. My car can't use the cassette adapters so this is a great alternative. I live in Los Angeles and the default setting worked just fine for my purposes."
3,works in my car only,"this is a great looking accessory and a great idea but the people at Griffin just didn't do a good enough job on the product. The signal is so weak that it only works(sometimes) when i stick it right on to the antennae of my home stereo and if i take it 1 inch away from the antennae, the signal is too weak. the only place it works is in my car(only my car) which i think is because the antannae for my car stereo is in the front(not sure). The signal is too weak for my brother's car. and another thing...this thing drains the battery as if there is no tomorrow. for a fm transmitter that produces such a weak signal is sure drinks a lot of juice. the only reason i gave it a 3 star is because it works in my car."
1,Useless!,"This product sounds great in concept but doesn't work. I bought it despite some horrible reviews thinking that in a smaller sized city, there wouldn't be as much interference. Even with many ""empty"" stations to program from, it was not do-able. The preset station comes through with a lot of static and none of the ""programmed"" stations come through any better. Please invest your money into some other product."
4,It's Pretty Cool,"Decent FM transmitter. I have trouble playing some rap music, as the sound quality sometimes gets quite distorted with bass reproduction. All other music plays well. It works perfect in my car and the battery life on the ipod with this transmitter is great. As far as home stereos, I have about a 10 foot range before the signal gets distorted (FM static). Not sure if it is the transmitter or that my stereo's antenna is weak. You're dealing with FM quality sound, so you can't get your hopes up too much. Overall, I would recommend this purchase unless you listen to 100% rap or can't handle non-""crystal clear"" music associated with CD playback. It's less than $30 bucks... buy it."
4,Worth the money!,"While others (particularly those in large cities) have complained about the static and lack of broadcast channels, I have found several channels that I can broadcast to successfully. This item works AS ADVERTISED. If you live in a big city with no clear channels, of COURSE you won't find one that will allow the iTrip to broadcast to without any interference. If you have at least one clear channel, though, I think you'll find it works just fine. I've had no problem with the transmit capability from my car (whether the iPod is in the cup holder, the ashtray, etc) to my antenna (back center of roof). The sound, of course, is not the same as having the CD IN the CD player--you don't get the stereo capabilities and sounds. Even still, this eliminates the need to carry every CD that I want to listen to and it's easy to use. I do plug it in to charge it while I transmit since the iTrip uses some power. I've also found this device to work very well at home. Enjoy!"
4,Works great in Honolulu,"Bought it at a retail store. It is essential that it is set at a ""clear"" channel that is neither occupied or has interference from other channels. Mine is set to 88.7, I can stand nearly 40 feet away from the radio and still no change in sound. What I did notice is that the quality of the receiver is also critical, they do not all tune in the same, some receivers will ""catch"" the channel better without even a hiss. Stereo seperation is also a factor. It is easy to setup and reconnect, no external power, no cords, many channels, and very affordable!"
1,"Looks good, discription sounds good - doesn't work in car.","From my experience it seems clear that this product does not work in an automobile. I spent several hours trying to get clear sounding music sent from my iPod Mini to a car stereo.After several hours of trying ""clear"" station after ""clear"" station I could not get the unit to ever transmit a good signal.I attempted this in a Jeep Grand Cherokee, a Honda Pilot, and a Mercedes SL500 (with top down).The iTrip works in our house, but it is useless if you want to listen to your iPod music in a car."
4,Dream theater - string style,"Regularly, a rock band goes string or orchestra album can really fall flat. But in the case of this album it really did a fine job. Mike Portnoy chose songs for the string quartet to cover that he felt would make interesting additions to the already incredible DT catalog. Also, since an orchestra had just accompanied the band on their Score album, he wanted to choose songs that weren't featured on there. All in all the best cut on this disc is the Ytse Jam. I don't know if this is a must have for all DT fans but if you are a fan of DT and of classical music you will find this soothing...it also is really nice in the background while doing other things."
4,Excellent Tribute!!,I recently was at a Dream Theater concert and I heard this music playing as the crew was setting up their show. I immediately wanted to buy the cd if it was available. I find the cd a refreshing perspective on the amazing Dream Theater arrangements. I highly recommend it to any DT fans
5,One for the collection,"The CD is great, although the track listing on the case doesn't match up with how they are on the CD...BUT this will show who the true fans are if they noticed this small error and can tell the actual order..."
3,Timex True,"This Timex was everything it was advertised to be.I am not wearing it because it isn't a good enoughtime piece but because in my opinion it didn't look righton my wrist. With a seven year battery, though, it makesa good spare."
3,OK if you know nothing of black hair (and like extensions),"I thought this would be a good companion to another book I purchased through amazon (No Lye by Tulani Kinard). But I was a little disappointed. It gave a history on hair, and why one should consider going natural. It also covered the negative feelings many blacks have towards their own features and hair due to racism and the after-effects of slavery. It rang true, but not every person who occasionally puts in green or gray eye contacts suffers from the racial self-hatred. It almost seemed like a salon photo book. It had a lot of extension how-to pictures, but just plain natural hair was what I thought would be showcased. It gave only one page of information about locks and their care. Overall this book would be good for someone who knows nothing at all about their african hair."
2,Get Behind Me Icky!,"I was a huge fan of ""Elephant"" and ""Get Behind Me Satan."" I have constantly defended these albums against those who criticize the White Stripes. But this album left me feeling icky. The first three songs were really good (especially ""You Don't Know What Love Is...""). But after hearing those three songs, I was expecting even better songs to come. Unfortunately, they did not. Jack's signature guitar licks are great and his voice is awesome and Meg's constant drum pounding is...well, it is what it is. However, the songs were mostly just odd with lyrics that felt freestyled and unimaginative. The music is very, very bluesy but it doesn't really go anywhere. This is nowhere near The Stripes best material. If they made a best of album, only about 2 songs on here should be included. Tracks six through nine were just terrible and needed to push the ""next"" button on. I am so disappointed, but will not give up on the Stripes. There is always next time."
1,The Return of the Vampire Orphans!!!,"Hello World,Get some sun and get some lessons you two. Get out and go for a hike or a fishing trip. You two ""winners"" look like vampire zombies, who's songs interchange with songs from before. My God, Romero will be calling any day now! Anywho, onto the music... nice hooks but overused chords might pay to get some lessons from ""better"" guitarists. Dont be so vein Jacko... the likes of Derek Trucks and Dan Auerbach should help ya out, maybe? And to Miss White, sexual frustration shouldn't lead to killing a bass drum sweetie. WE HEAR IT ALREADY! Maybe Janet Weiss could help ya out with that one huh? The White Stripes is an understatement!!!!! These two are ""The Ivory Barcodes"" huh now thats fitting!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy Junk! (note:im nut rezpunsible fer n e mispellings)"
1,Unfortunately no zero-star option,"I saw these people on the final Conan O'Brien show. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'm still not certain they aren't a joke. They were the worst-sounding group I've ever heard presented as professional musicians. Just abyssmal, ear-killing, retarded crap. Possibly a sign of the approaching nadir of all culture."
4,"its good ,really it is ....not great ...but really really good","this album is very good , at first i was alittle put off by its lack of flow , that being one song to another , however as with all thier work there is a listening curve . i will not go song by song because that is stupid and those that choose to do that are just wind bags that wish they were something they will never be ....important. this cd is very good but does not stick with you as with earlier works , white blood cells or the even better de stijl . however for the playlist group there at least 6 songs on here that will make the list ...buy this , nine inch nails "" year zero"", fiest ""reminder' and mavis staple we'll never turn back ....and man you will have a solid base for you summer tunes ...buy this now ."
1,Who are the ad wizards that came up with this one?,"Offering the album on a USB drive is a neat gimmick, but for a hundred bucks this is just ridiculous. You can buy the album for 10 bucks, a 1 gig USB drive for under 10 bucks... so we're supposed to pay $80 for stickers?Give me a break!"
5,Incredible,I thought this cd would be heavy but it is a little more bluesy. Still it is in my top five favorite CD's and always will be.
2,Disappointing,"I've been a big fan of the White Stripes from day one and I've liked all their albums so far (yes, even Get Behind Me Satan) but after three listens, I'm disappointed by this one. Where the White Stripes self-imposed restrictions used to work for them previously, it works against them this time. Jack tries to be more ambitious in his songs but find himself stuck within his own formula. Meg's limitations are more evident than ever and it's obvious that she can't keep up anymore. Jack still has the talent but it sounds like the White Stripes have run their course. Find yourself a band and a real drummer Jack and come back to us."
2,easily their worst album,"Not sure what happened - this album just isn't on par with their other releases. Doesn't have the feeling of the other albums, many of the tracks cause me to reach for the skip track button as soon as I hear them. Not innovative, sometimes barely musical. If you're new to TWS, start with any other album or your experience with the band won't last long."
3,grows on you...,"This finale White Stripes CD from year 2007 grows on you and you realize the songs are playing in your head. More enjoyable than I would have suspected, as I never a decade ago had any good opinion of the White Stripes. It appears that, while some of us weren't paying attention, ol' Jack and Meg had been quietly ""perfecting their chops"" so to speak."
3,Starts out strong,"I bought this after hearing two of the singles on the radio, and those are the best two on the CD."
4,I just don't feel it like I used to . . .,"While it's better than 95% of the junk out there, this is not the geniune blues/rock that he played in his earlier albums. Overly produced and not really interesting. I doubt this will be part of anyone's ipod rotation in 6 months. The lyrics are a little annoying too--it would have been better if slurred his lyrics more, so we could not hear the actual words. Get ""Elephant"" or ""White Blood Cells"" if you don't have those WS albums yet and save this one for last."
2,I dont get it?,Take one catchy song that rips off Led Zep and then a bunch of sloppy drums and guitar and you have this album. Why are people so drawn to a Bass-less band with a Bass-ic (he he) drummer? The last few albums were so much better. This is just annoying and Black seems to love other bands riffs.....maybe this album will grow on me? I dont know? I can say that I am really disappointed as of now.
3,Not their best.,"For me, the White Stripes can do no wrong. And while they didn't do wrong with Icky Thump, they didn't do their best either. If I had to choose a couple cuts to recommend, I'd pick ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" and ""Effect and Cause."""
3,Jack enters his Ziggy Stardust phase,"This White Stripes album is quite different from their earlier work. Listening to this album is almost like getting into a time-machine and going back to the days of glam rock, it is quite trippy. I admit that this album is quite hypnotic after a few listenings. It is also quite self-indulgent. It is almost Jack White saying ""I am Jack White and I can do anything."" And make no mistake, there is a broad range of sound at work here."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I am a boomer who usually sticks to Van Morrison, Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, the Band, Dylan etc. I had heard a great deal about White Stripes. I tried this CD, and I really like it. It is interesting and different in many ways, but each song is good; each song catches your ear. Some reviewers thought bagpipes or other sounds were a bit of a joke, but I think each song works very well. (I also liked Radiohead, Hail to the Thief, in the kind of way that you know it is different, but everything is good in its own way.) I would recommend this CD to anyone of any age."
5,My Favorite Since White Blood Cells,"The gimmickry and false starts of Get Behind Me Satan (intermingled with a few really promising tracks, of course) have been far surpassed by this much stronger album. After about eight listens, I am really happy with this release. It's great!"
2,Zep Without Zip,"When I first heard them I liked the White Stripes because of their Led Zeppelin sound but after a few listens it's apparent the Stripes are not up to par with Zep. Maybe they are aware of their limitiations and that is why they maintain that playful aura or maybe that is the realm they prefer to play in. In their early years, when Heart would channel Led Zepplin they really rocked. I don't see that here. But I do give the Stripes credit for not doing a straight rip-off like Lenny Kravitz does."
1,Knock off poo,"sounds are recycled, they seem to be as bored with making music as I am with listening to them."
1,Showing Their Stripes Again,"I find this release to be no different than any other the Stripes have put out. There is really only a couple of works that are worthwhile, with the larger portion being there to satisfy the freaks that are satisfied by weirdness for being weirdness. I would recommend caution purchasing this...it will not remain in my collection. Jack should put out fewer albums, with more quality creation...he is obviously capable from the good stuff...what little there is...Jack White, or Jack WHAT?"
2,Not sold on it yet...,"Maybe I just have to listen to it a few more times... it kind of loses me after track 3... I had nothing against Get Behind Me Satan, only that it wasn't as good as Elephant.I MISS the catchy stuff... and other than Icky Thump (title track) nothing is catching my attention off this one just yet.There is some killer guitar work, but I miss Meg's ballads...It'll happen again, I suppose. One reviewer mentioned GBMS as their possible dud.So far for me, this may be it."
2,Boring...,"This band hit their peak with Elephant, but ever since I feel like Jack has been tossing us gimmicks to keep albums coming out. He has run out of riffs and song writing ideas on this one. This sounds like a parody of the White Stripes. Personally, I'm tired of bands trying too hard to make an album sound like it came out in 1969. Be original, move ahead, and try something new. I can't wait for all the 19 year old kids who are about to start a new music revolution. We all need it badly because garage rock has seen better days. What a boring album."
3,Icky Thump,This music cd was rated as a general rock n roll music.It should been rated as alternitive music. I was disappointed with this one.
1,CD opened and CD case cracked,This is supposed to be a new CD. There is no plastic packaging and the CD case is cracked. It is a badly used CD not a new one. This CD could be damaged.
2,Not a favorite,"I really wanted to like this. Jack's fine. Meg needs more practice. Good vocals, better guitar, but very poor percussion/rhythm. I find myself skipping forward a lot, and then ejecting within minutes."
2,How about NO?,"Wow, I can't believe all the glowing reviews for this album.Heres my quick review of it - you don't have to agree with everything I'm saying:1. If you likes the White Stripes work so far, then you would love this. Its more of the same, nothing Groundbreaking, nothing revolutionary.2. This is one of those `flavor of the month' albums that garner a lot of blog praise, but later in the year no one will even remember it.3. Though some of the rock tunes here are good (in an `averagey' sort of way), none of them are memorable (even after three listens)4. Theres this OVERWHELMING feeling of `been there, done that'. In fact, the entire album sounds very tired to me.5. You could do much better than fall for the hype.I would highly recommend the new Smashing Pumpkins album, or even the Sara Bareilles album over this one, anyday.Two Stars. Skip this one."
3,White Stripes,was purchased as a gift. not my type of music but the recipient liked it somewhat. thought it was o.k.
5,Awesome. Terrific rock album.,"After skipping the White Stripes last album, because of its apparent lack of guitar, I was eager to hear the new one. Having read that Jack White the guitar hero was back in full force, I eagerly picked up Icky Thump. I was not at all disappointed. The album is fantastic. Yes, Jack's guitar is back! The album is loud, it rocks and the songs are great. All of them. There's nary a weak track here. In addition to guitar, the songs also incorporate bagpipes (!!!), old-school Univox synthesizers and a mariachi trumpet. If you like the White Stripes or just good rock music in general, Icky Thump is very worthwhile."
4,They Rock and They Know it!,"The White Stripes Rock and they know it. They also don't care what you or I or anyone else thinks. This is what makes them so cool. Jack and Meg are free of all of the pretentions that make most artisits so impressed with themselves. The Stripes simply make the musc that they, themselves want to hear, and invite you over to hang out, have a few beers and experience the vibe. Icky Thump, the title track is a perfect example of what freedom from judgement can provide - its rockin', trippy, and full of primitive attitude. The slight artsy pretense that encumbered Get Behind Me Satan is nowhere to be found on outstanding tracks like Rag and Bone and Catch Hell Blues. Now, Jack and Meg are just simply cooler than the rest of the modern rock bands. and they know it. and that's damn cool in and of itself."
5,God gave seven minutes right to ya!,"I love this cd! Every song is great, Jack does it again! and Meg has such a sweetvoice I wish she would sing more!"
3,iPhone Kindle version,"The text is interesting. However - this you don't read front to back. If I want to look up Verdi, there's a table of contents; and the V's are a few hundred or thousand swipes; or using the location bar at the bottom of the iPhone version until somehow you hit the right page. A simple search feature (like Adobe Reader), or an alphabetical index would make this (and many non-fiction books) much more useful. As it is - an expensive sampler for the paperback, which I should have gotten."
4,"Vital resource, but...","I would have given this a five star rating, but for Kindle users, it has a maddening table of contents. It probably cannot be helped. I've figured out a way to zip to, say, Vivaldi, without plodding through page after page of the table of contents (go to the alphabet and right click through to the V's and then work your way carefully...) But the content never fails. Yes, there are some omissions, but how could there not be? Superior to other encyclopedias I have. I have it at bedside and frequently refer to it when I learn of something or someone new, or just want to brush up on a person or piece. Well worth having. Probably, I would get the book form rather than the Kindle if I were to do it again."
1,Disappointed,I would have rated this much higher if the code to access the Naxos site actually worked. I have had no luck after numerous tries. Naxos did not reply after they were contacted online. The code may have expired or something.
1,"""This Mission, Should You Choose To..."" WHAT THE FRICTION?!! May-Day. May-Day. Mission: Abort.","The only track worth listening to on this crap is the first one, which is a decent remix of the main theme. The rest is just a horrid mess of convoluted music so bad it can only be called N-O-I-S-E. AVOID like the Plague and get the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. It's much better, and get the soundtrack for the even better sequel."
2,OK soundtrack,"Was disappointed that it didn't include the Mission Impossible theme I heard at the end of the movie. Good orchestral sequences, but only for the classical at heart!"
3,A moderate CD at best.,"This CD has some good tracks, but most of them are worthless. Don't be like me and buy it just for the Mission: Impossible Theme. Go after something like Raiders of the Lost Ark."
1,STOP! This is NOT what you are looking for.,"This CD has a handful of the most horrid attrocities ever attemped to be called ""music"" that I have ever had the unfortunate priveledge of listening to. The first time I saw this movie, I was very young and enjoyed the soundtrack. I recieved the cd as a gift. THIS IS NOT THE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE SOUNDTRACK. It is Music from (COUGH like 3 songs COUGH) and music ""inspired by"" the film. Now incase you are wondering what kind of music this movie would be likely to ""inspire"" stop yourself right there and let me tell you the answer. GARBAGE. There is music on this cd that's so mind curdlingly horrid that it makes you want to take two pencils, stick them up your nose, and slam your head down on the desk.(!!!!) It's that bad. Get the REAL soundtrack. I hope you enjoyed my warning, now I have to pull these pencils out of my brain cavity."
3,"Where to find more music by the ""No Government"" singer","To the reviewer who said you'll look in vain for other music by her: not so (if you work at it). She did an album before this and (by 2005) two albums after. And appeared on other albums.You can get the original, rawer, drum n' bass version of the song ""No Government"" from the ablum ""Now is Early"" and several compilations several places, but this album's version is the best one unless you like drum n' bass, and the vocal here is smoother and more ""produced"".Lots of Nicolette's music other places has very nice vocals, but the jarring high and varying tempo music with complicated beats behind her voice are distracting unless you ike that sort of thing.For people who like ""No Government"" and who don't like fast drum and bass beats with their smooth singing, you've pretty much limited to the songs she sang on Massive Attack's albums. Start with ""Three"" on the album ""Protection""."
3,OKAY,"The songs on the whole were not bad but the only REALLY appealing one was of course the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE theme song. I find the song "" alright"" by Casts quite addictive, while the rest weren't that fantastic( but 'Dreams"" by Cranberries is worth looking forward, if you're able to figure out what connection it has to the movie). On the whole, it is not bad( with kinda catchy tunes), but the original soundtrack would definitely be a better choice compared to this."
1,VERY POOR COPY - SEEMS OUT OF FOCUS OR FUZZY,"This is an extremely poor copy! Remember the movie ""Multiplicity"" with Michael Keaton? Well, this DVD seems like it's a ""copy of a copy of a copy""! It's video images are fuzzy and slightly out of focus. Just to the point of being quite irritating, actually. I'd never recommend buying it - you might be able to find a better rendition (copy) on the internet somewhere; this DVD video, from an image quality perspective, sucks big time!"
3,A GOOD ONE TO OWN,"Perfect to own, you will find youself wanting to watch it again. The mood is eerie enough, the stories keep you interested and it's made well. It's all about the atmosphere, get this DVD."
2,Very boring and trite,"Some movies from the 80's get better with age, such as Earth Girls are Easy which has a great 80's feel that now is extremely dated and vintage, and by that right alone is worth watching. Others, despite mullets throughout, stay somehow timeless, such as Lost Boys. This movie has neither working for it. It's got almost zero style. The soundtrack is nearly non-existant except for some notes here and there which set the mood that you are watching one of the rare bad episodes of Columbo. The plot is very clumsey. Worst is the cutesey, overly forced-sassiness of the females efforts in seducing the moderately good looking male. Or maybe the male's terrible attempts at acting like he's on a phone call, repeatedly yelling ""No-"", and ""Bradshaw"" (such a cliche' boss/investigator's name). Just a horrible movie I regret trying to watch."
4,It Works,"I have never used one of these before, but it seems to do ok. It softens the intensity of the flash, yet allows enough light for a good picture. It seems to work better for distances not exceeding 15 feet."
3,Pretty basic information on starting.,I wish the audio was a little better but it is suitable. Nothing new in this dvd that you don't already know if you show.
5,Give Credit Where Credit is Due,"Alright, we know that White is a master vocalist, arranger, and lyricist. But, what other pop/R&B artist in the twentieth century played a harpsichord with such passion?Don't know the instrument? Then, listen carefully to the magnificent ""I Can't Believe You Love Me!"" Man, this is the BOMB, a perfect blend of orchestration and vocal interpretation!Hit the REPEAT function and enjoy!"
3,A Very Barry White,More talking than singing on most cuts. Good first time around but a bit tiresome when you re-listen just for the mood. Worth the discounted price.
2,did not fit the binding post??,I bought this binding post wrench so that it would be easier to tighten the posts for my receiver speaker wires so that they would be tighter for better reception I think that they being a so-called universal wrench should have been tried on the binding posts that they were supposed to work on they were guaranteed to fit any and all posts
2,"i just recived the battery, not the sync cradle dock !!!",i just recived the battert not the sync cradle dock
5,Yahtzee is the a great game!,"I've played Yahtzee since I was young. My sons started playing last year and now we play all the time. I bought this travel set for my oldest son to take on trips, to use at sports tournaments while passing the time, etc... The zipper case is great, the spaces to store the dice are nice, all around a great purchase!"
5,...the chosen road...,"...i can't believe i never reviewed this album...this is simply the most brilliant piece of wax to ever exist for any one who actually appreciates the art of writing a song (and not just songwriting)...so few and far between are there exquisite masterpieces like this that exemplify the craft so beautifully (other examples in this small, but important, category, are Tina Vero's ""In The Waiting"", Andy and Denise's ""Sunlight In Goodbye"", and Linda Dunn's self-titled ""Linda Dunn"" album.)...Get these four albums and you won't even need a 'top five'..."
5,A beautiful work that never got its due.,"Des'ree. I Ain't Movin. What can I say that isn't self-evident? This is one of the most beautiful, moving albums I've ever listened to, done by a true artist with an absolutely wonderful voice. Oh, and there's nothing the least bit banal or tiresome about her music. And while she has a message...several messages, in fact...she doesn't hit you over the head with them. There's not a single unlistenable, cringe-inducing, or hard on the ears track here, not one. Did I mention that she has an absolutely wonderful voice?There are many albums worth 5 stars; I Ain't Movin' is a 5 star album OF 5 star albums. It's that good."
4,i really dug this album,i really dug this album by Des'ree.her voice goes rather well with the music.the lyrics are good as well.she is a very talented singer.i first heard her on Terence Trent D'arby's Delicate.You Gotta Be has had an Influence in the states on alot of Records that i have heard.
4,Herald The Day is the best song.,"This is one of the best CDs I own still! ""Herald The Day"" is so moving and inspiring that I often play it when I'm lost in the day. Des'ree's rhythms and chord progressions are the best. It keeps me moving!"
5,A Great Adventure!,"An ideal book for that oh-so-hard-to-reach group: tween boys. Filled with adventure, mystery and intrigue and just the right sense of humor, I'd reccomend it highly!"
4,sistas,"Love the picture, received this one with no problems. I only wish it came bigger then offered. However it still worked out get as a gift."
3,Mainly a book of tips,"This book is basically full of tips on the use of the machine(s)...not a comprehensive manual. You will definitely still need to refer to the Roland manuals for many things. I was hoping this book would take you step by step in plain language for every thing...not the case. The writers obviously know their stuff, but I wish it was more in depth...and that's pretty much impossible when the book covers all the Roland VS series recorders."
3,so so,"I just own the 2480, so there are a LOT of pages of this book, most in fact, that are useless.I did get a few things out of it that were very useful. But each machine deserves it's own book. Not several machines crammed into one."
2,Does NOT taste like any kind of cake,"Tastes like a dark or french coffee with a vaguely chemical taste. Not horrible but not good either. Paid $21 for 4 bags, worth about 1/2 that."
3,"Great, but falls apart","These are great socks. Lightweight warm comfortable. I've bought around 10 pairs.Unfortunately, I've found out that after 3-4 cycles of washing and drying the stitching loosens and the socks no longer fit properly. After this happens they tend to bunch up under one's feet in the shoes. Very uncomfortable!!I bought a similar item from LL Bean. They're one dollar cheaper and do not loosen up after a few uses. They are a better value for the money."
5,one of the best albums i have ever heard,"I first saw the longpigs in my hometowm in 1996, from then on they have been one of my favourite bands. I have had a copy of the sun is often out for nearly 6 years now and it still blows me away every time i hear it. If you like music fro the heart you will love this album. Although the longpigs are now split up both albums are still worth buying as thier music does not seem to age."
5,Music fan,The Longpigs debut album is the best album to come out of England since Pablo Honey from Radiohead. Every track draws you to thier mysterious aura of greatness. The entire album builds into a pinnacle of music genius. This album is a must for any serious music fan. A good listen everytime. They just get better and better.
3,An OK product,After using these straps for a few months have have come to the conclusion that they are ok. In some respects they are very good and in others they are poor.Pros:Very Durable (will last long and not fray)Rubber gripstrong grip on non dynamic liftsCons:Leaves marks on wristThe material does not absorb moisture and can slip after repsGrip moves a lot with dynamic motionIt takes a while for grips to break in and mold to the barA couple extra notesFor non dynamic lifts (dead-lifts) the grip is good but will still leave marks.For dynamic lifts such as clean the grip will move and not mold to bar.I am going to buy the other basic version of these straps. They don't last as long (I had them for 6 years) but they are more cotton like and grip much better.
3,not what i had expected,"I thought it would be like a traditional lifting strap. I figured these would be stronger because they're made of nylon but without the padding on them, they rubbed my skin and left marks for a week at a time. They do their job, but it scrapes your skin at the same time making the next few days a little irritating. They were stiff at first, but I wore them in. If you wrap the strap on top of itself, it won't work right. You have to wrap it so you only grab a single layer at a time. Its a hundred times more effective that way. All in all, it's a great product. I just wish it didn't hurt my wrists as much."
4,for revolving bars/handles,"Bought these at a local store, tried them on a chinup bar quickly enough to avoid being tackled by store employees. Wish I had risked the tackle and played with them longer. Downloaded the video at Harbinger's site: ""...and turn the bar to tighten the grip."" So, great for olympic straight bars and dumbbells you can turn; I need these for a shrug/hex bar and four 100lb dumbbells I've attached with HangUps -- neither setup rotates. Use these rubber side out and they're very slick, very stiff, very durable nylon straps -- you'll need to grip with more force than with cotton straps, but who doesn't need a free forearm workout. Gave them four stars, but don't discount any five or one star reviews. How's that for a wishy-washy review."
3,wrist straps,they are really really stiff.....i would try and wash and dry them a few times because they are kinda hard to use.....they hurt a little and are hard to get tight around a bar.....but im sure they will get looser and fit better
4,Good but...,Extremly tight once you span it you can even let your fingers go and you will still be hanging. those rubber lines really stick to bar. but it also makes it realy dificult to span it by your self. i cna do one hand but for other one i always need help from my spoter. regular twisting until is tight just dont work with this item. as soon as it touches metal it sticks like is glued. next time i will buy ones with metal hooks.
1,"Painful and Uncomfortable, Difficult to Hold Straps","These straps might be OK in theory (wide, gripping material sewn in), but they're so stiff they immediately cut into my wrists under any load whatsoever. Also, since I pretty much sweat all over while at the gym (including my hands and palms), this material became even more difficult to hold onto lift after lift. I guess the gripping material provides more friction against the bar than other straps I've used, but what good is that when the straps slip against your fingers?Save your money & look elsewhere. I'm currently using Schiek Sports Schiek Lifting Strap Dowel 1000, which I'm much happier with. Nice material, no slipping."
1,Going Back to HARBINGER Classic Cotton,"I bought Harbinger 20600 after reading all the reviews but still not being able to discern which were honest authentic reviews. So after three months of use they simply are not as comfortable as the classic cotton. Yes, the classic cotton fray and wear out after three years but they are comfortable and easily conform to the wrist."
1,Material is great - design needs work!,"I have been using lifting straps for a few years and these are the worst I've seen. The material is rubber and really great. However, the strap is way too rigid and makes keeping it on your wrist a tough thing to do. I had to eat these because they are too much work. If you really want a great strap, get these [..]"
1,Not worth it,"These wrist wraps were a disappointment. I usually just borrow plain cloth ones at the gym where I go or just wear gloves and use over/under grip, but I figured that I might as well get my own set.I used them for the first time yesterday for a back workout, lifting (or pulling) 250+ lbs, and they were very uncomfortable. The adjustment takes forever, getting them tight around the bar is inconvenient, and worst of all the material is rough, which left me with 2 pretty bruised up wrists."
1,The original is better.,"World Standard Fitness has been producing a padded rubberized strap for about 6 or 7 years now. They actually received a Canadian and U.S. patent on the rubberized lifting strap a few years ago. I even saw pictures of Phil Heath using them in the Nov. 2006 edition of Flex magazine. I read more about this company, the rubberized lifting strap, and its patents at its dot com website. btw, the rubberized lifting straps work brilliantly when you wrap them with the rubber side towards the hand, not the bar, as per the instructions that WSF give with their straps."
4,Helpful book,This book is very helpful for anyone trying to beat this game. It helped me through much of it.
5,compelling and moody,"The lead singer's voice has a certain depth and sadness to it. It's a good ""after-the-break-up"" album! Actually, I listen to it all the time. His voice is emotional and refreshing at the same time. It's rare that an artist could move it's listeners the way his voice does."
4,Not Everyone Is Ready For This Music,"""Have You Forgotten"" is worth the price of admission. Buy this album for this contemporary classic and roll forward with the rest of the CD like you were meant to. When all is said and done you will wish you had found Mark( the creative genius behind all of this) a whole lot sooner. Incidentally, if you want an even more melodic version of ""Have You Forgotten"" then you will have to buy the soundtrack to the film ""Vanilla Sky"". You should own them both!!"
5,took a chance,"I purchased the CD after I heard the song Have you forgotten on the Vanilla Sky soundtrack (which is an awesome album) . It is a great CD, I can't stop listening to it, even though the first song isn't anything like it is in the movie, I think it is even better. This is music for a ""laid back"" soul."
1,Sad,"Got this DVD, and was sad to say not what I had expected. This video was only about 30 minutes long and the only form that Master Su Ke Gan did was an abbreviated Hsing-I form. I feel that the producer of this DVD was in Taiwan and figured he could make a buck with a camcorder. Save your money unless you have a tie with Master Su Ke Gan."
1,Sorry . . .,"Yeah, right. It's like the guy happened to be in a park with his camcorder when a master and two students were practicing. On the cover it says lessons are shown and with explanations. Well, there maybe explanations, but they are in Taiwanese and guess what, I don't speak Taiwanese! Nice examples of some forms, but lessons . . .explanations . . .short range combat volume 1, I don't think so!Go spend your money on ""Unleashed"" or ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"". It's money better spent with no illusions."
5,The Perfect Padded Mailing Envelopes!!,I love this product and always come back to order more! They are excellent quality and an amazing value! Thank you ValueMailers!
5,"awesome, simply awesome!","awesome lyrics, great upbeat tunes! well worth adding to your CD collection. fun, bouncy tunes by fun, bouncy girls..."
5,The Maestro - Barry White,"Barry White is one of the most under rated Maestro's of all time. I am 47 years old and have been listening to Barry since I was a child. Being the youngest of 7, I was able to tag on to my older siblings coat tails and appreciate the love of music. My first concert at 14 was Barry White. My brother (now deceased) took me to my first concert, so the love I had for them both has intensified. I would recommend all of Barry's hits, even when he was with Love Unlimited.... My Man..."
4,Hot record...,"Although it is pretty hard to do a follow up to the flawless ""Cant Get Enough..."" this has some very strong moments. Although not perfect from start to finish like its predecessor, the strong numbers on this are some of the Maestro's best."
4,Great album; Questionable cd quality,"This is an excellent album,tracks 4 through 6 are the best in my opinion. Unfortunately,track 7 is a nondescript instrumental; the only low point on the whole thing. Beware of low quality cd mastering, though. My copy had some unpleasant scratchy noises from the left channel on the starts of tracks 4,6,and 7. Your tolerance for this may vary."
1,Avoid this product,I purchased the chair for my son and had it delivered to him at camp. I just got word from him that the chair broke on the first use.
3,fun to watch,I missed a few of the movies and I was fun to see them and show them to friends and family.
4,Great Classics!,"Great quality and well, theyre decades old movies about the Anti-Christ so theyre pretty good. Sam Niell does an excellent job in 3!"
4,Great price...,"...if you haven't already seen The Omen and its sequels, you should watch at least the original. It is one of the creepiest movies you will ever watch. This set is agreat buy as it contains the original ""The Omen"" as well as its 3 sequels: The Omen II, The Omen III, and the Omen IV. As an added bonus it also contains The Omen (2006) remake. This is an excellent buy for the price, if you buy the remake and the original 2 Disc Collector's edition you are looking at $40 already, and this set is selling for less than that. It's a good addition to your library, and for the price it should not be passed up."
2,Just buy the original; sequels & remake are awful.,"Except for the 1976 orignal version of the film, there is nothing worth watching in this 5 DVD collection. Looking at the price, one might think it is a bargain; it is not! No words come close to describing how bad the remake is; the acting (Except for Mia Farrow & Pete Postlethwaite) was nauseating. Damien 3 was a very cheaply done film, which has a Monty Python feel to it. The Omen IV was plain stupid and boring. The Omen II was somewhat watchable with decent acting, but it lacks horror, suspense or anything that makes it interesting . My advice, you will gain nothing from adding this collection to your video library, if you already have the original 1976 version of ""The Omen""."
1,Buyer beware!,"Four of the six DVDs in this box set were seriously scratched (to the point where they couldn't be played). Only the two-disc set of the original ""Omen"" was salvageable. Either the manufacturer is producing defective product, or Amazon is trying to sell used DVDs and calling them ""new."" Don't waste your money."
2,"Good Price, Longing Plot *Spolier*","Basically I thought this was a good deal because it included both the original and the remake. But if that's all you want is one of those or both, just buy both. The rest of this series was a waste of time. Part II had so many predictable deaths, I felt like I was watching ""Final Destination,"" which is a decent series unto itself, but with ""The Omen"" being about mankind's end of days according to scripture, I expected more of a supernatural feeling and events foretold in the Bible. This series had no Armageddon, no Mark of the Beast, nothing apocalyptic but a creepy little boy who was the product of the stereotypical spoiled, silver-spoon white American family.I say, watch the first one and leave it at that."
3,Cute children's book,"The book tells the story of a little girl and her mom riding the subway. I bought this for my 4 year old brother for Christmas; both he and our 2 year old cousin like the rhymes and the illustrations. I was mainly attracted to it because of the non-white characters, which isn't always the case in children's books. (My brother and cousin are both white.)"
4,"Great work, energy-consuming read though","The approach to propaganda here is very scientific, which is good. As all emotional factors are nailed down into science. I skip most of ethic parts as I am reading this from marketer point of view. Lots of studies after studies, some may like that, but I find it tiresome. And if you are not very much into US politcs, many examples are simply a waste of time.Anyway, the content is really interesting and well-organized. Great work indeed!"
1,This book about propaganda IS propaganda ITSELF!,"Wow! I was expecting that this book would discuss propaganda from a scientific and factual perspective, unfortunately, the authors use this book and write under the guise of ""experts"" to further their own political agenda.The authors need to learn the difference between fact and fiction. They make a great deal of bold assertions, yet fail to cite the sources of these assertions. Additionally, the book makes sharp attacks to those on the political right with no real rhyme or reason. Its the Michael Moore approach to writing, but worse, as Michael Moore at least does not try and pass off his books as a text on the subjects he is writing about.This book is nothing more than a poorly written outlet for the authors to attack Republicans. For shame!!"
3,Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion,"This book would have been rated much higher if not for the authors abuse of propaganda, contrary to what they hope to accomplish by putting this book together. The authors in trying to explain different topics of persuasion makes you wonder if they harbor bitterness toward those who are in the right."
3,Review of Davis' Marquis 2,"I feel that Guy Davis has created a very interesting world, but I don't know that I quite understand the mission or context of his hero. Why does the Marquis have these powers? When did he begin this vendetta against 'sinners'? Many of these answers may have been answered in the first volume, which I don't have direct access to. The character is interesting, as are his enemies, but I'm unsure about the plot of this story."
5,Timeless,"Approachable, warm and friendly jazz that makes you glad that you've grown up. Great band, smooth pipes, no complications. A wonderful voice interpreting a heartfelt selection of songs you'll sing along with (but not as well as Laura)."
3,"Good Movie, Contentious Edition","The movie has captivated me since I was a teenager. David Cronenberg draws a surreal, yet plausible picture of a future where disease is spread through elctrons, not human touch.Great movie. I felt the only thing that was wrong with the Criterion edition was that deleted scenes were missing. Seeing the edited for TV version, scenes were added from the theatrical version, but missing from the Criterion Edition. The deleted scenes cleared up some of the movie's gaps, including how Spectacular Optical found videodrome by developing a sighting system for tanks. Criterion goes to the trouble of resurrecting obscure material never seen before, but skips over material that would make a fine director's cut? What a waste. Let Universal publish another $5.49 cheap rip for Target and Walmart."
2,Criterion misses the boat on this one,"I'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because Debbie Harry is in it. It is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers' discretion. Is Debbie Harry real or is she just another ""Videodrome"" hallucination? I definately wouldn't say this is a ""fun"" movie either...after watching it I felt dirty and sleazy, like I needed to take a long hot shower. Anyway, since this is the big fancy ""Criterion Collection"" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version."
5,The Television Syndrome,"One of my favorite movies with John Hurt, John Woods and Deborah Harry. This is about the way television has or will take over lives in invasive and non-invasive ways. One becomes so devoted to a television show that one becomes a part of the streaming beam that provides the wanted, no needed images that are to be shown on the screen. What of the subliminal? Is someone controlling the airwaves to target the mind with unseen and unheard mmessages? Challenge the box and try to discover for yourself."
3,The shape of things to come,"Impossible to forget, yet deeply flawed as a cohesive film (unlike ""Clockwork Orange""), Videodrome stays with us and may someday assume a kind of ""classic"" stature. James Woods can make the best of any script, Deborah Harry didn't embarrass herself, and we can take comfort in the fact that Rick Baker's visual effects will improve considerably from these ""rough"" forms seen in the movie (yuk).Videodrome was prophetic in that it forecast the availability of the really creepy stuff you can now find on the internet, and brings up the old hair-raising argument of whether or not ""snuff"" films really exist and why they fascinate us so."
2,Disappointing,"This brutal Cronenburg film began with an intriguing story. The hallucinating effects are brilliant, as is James Woods performance. But as the story unfolds it becomes boring, trivial, and lost. For a good Cronenburg film, check out Naked Lunch or Crash. As for a James Woods performance, any will do. His acting is never anything less than superior."
5,Thank you Criterion.,"This film is finally getting the treatment it deserves, a double-disc Criterion edition. It will be re-discovered and newly discovered by Cronenberg & Criterion fans alike.The soundtrack and the dialogue were always more disturbing to me than the imagery, which still shocks and creeps under your skin more than any CGI effect ever could. It's the organic nature of Cronenberg's style that sets him apart from everyone, period.It's also his most prophetic work, a warning for how television can and has warped our sense of reality.""The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena, the Videodrome."""
5,Super Chilling Television Film,"This film is an amazing weirdlook at how television can change your mind. Im not a Cronenburg Fan but what he portrays is a techno mind twister that will keep you at your wits end. Although people say its weird and disgusting, the whole idea and story is pretty incredible! I was a little shaky if this would be good or not. It's awesome! The transfer was brilliant. The image is crisp, clean, and debri free! Sound is crystal clear, and takes you into the strange world of Videodrome! This purchase was worth it. Great extras as well. James Woods is an extrodianary actor and fits the film well. Highly Reccomended thriller!!"
3,Be warned: the Universal DVD release is nonanamorphic,"This is not a critique of the movie itself (which you should definitely watch), or the Criterion releases. This applies only to the Universal DVD, which blinded my good judgement with its low price.The details on Amazon's listing are wrong (hopefully to be updated soon). The Universal DVD release of this film is not anamorphic. It is not enhanced for widescreen televisions. No 16x9. However you want to say it.If picture quality matters to you, or if you like bonus features beyond ""production notes"", just pay the extra money and go with Criterion."
5,Hallucinations or reality?,"This is a strange movie dealing with a mysterious cable signal that gives viewers uncanny hallucinations. James Woods is a cable station operator who investigates the source of the signal and eventually succumbs to it's effects. Lots of slimy special effects including a man who turns inside out after being shot and a pistol that fuses to Woods's hand. Some viewers may be offended by scenes of female torture and bondage so beware. Overall, a highly enjoyable and yet somewhat confusing film from the great master of biological horror."
4,saw this on cable in yakima wa. struck by the pace & gore,great movie for those who like movies. way before its time and hard to understand. probably best seen late at night and under the influence.
3,The New Flesh is a bit spoiled,"I like this movie, but as a cheap crazy horror film, not as a serious film. The acting is abysmal, the accent of one character is so bad, it might as well be Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle. There is no story, the plot twists are laughable and this is one of the most dated looking films from the era. So why do I like it? Because it's an elaborate joke on the audience. It starts out exactly like a TV movie and ends up as weird as Eraserhead. I find it hard to believe that anyone would take this movie seriously. A lot of drugs might be responsible for that sort of reaction."
2,Bad.,"Probably the worst Cronenberg film I've seen, and I am a fan. An incoherent, pretentious mess. Sorry I wasted my time."
3,How Much Talent Could YOU Waste in One Movie,"No matter how you take this movie (I like to think that it's a camp take-off on a Vincent Price movie) it seems a shame to waste the acting talents of Blondie and James Wood on so prosaic a story. Cronenberg is able to do such a good job at making the most salacious sado-masochistic scenes look positively mundane. He also makes a naked Deborah Harry about as sexy as a dishrag.OK, how can you take anyone named Dr. O'Blivien seriously, no matter how engrossed he is in his subject (not to mention where did he get such a 'hot' daughter). The idea that at some point, whether with the help of drugs or a type of brainwashing, we will have the ability to control people through the images sent through their TV sets. It's currently being tried in North Korea where the TVs are two way and every one can be watched.Does this film make a statement, well yes, but the real question is: Is it worth listening to the message?Zeb Kantrowitz"
3,Bizarre film,"Interesting ideas marred by depictions of gratuitous violence as well as a confusing, disjointed presentation. I find it difficult to recommend this to anyone."
5,Videodrome,"Leave it to Canadian horror maven Cronenberg to concoct a bizarre but intelligent paranoid chiller involving televisual mind-control, sadomasochism, and a mysterious leader named Brian O'Blivion. Cronenberg's cunning black wit and obsession with technology and flesh are in ample evidence, as we're treated to throbbing TV screens, oozing gadgets, and gruesome images of body horror. Woods is impeccable playing a man whose fetishes and voyeuristic tendencies in some ways mirror our own. Blondie singer Deborah Harry is also surprisingly strong as Renn's kinky girlfriend. Offering pointed lessons for a culture even more besotted with images of sex and violence today, ""Videodrome"" is a disturbing fable about the breakdown of reality in the media age."
4,Videodrome....whoa,"I can't believe nobody knows about this film! This wonderful trip into violence on television really stuck in my mind a long time after viewing. James Woods is excellent as Max Renn, the cable station programmer who's violent program lineup ""provides an outlet for the viewers frustrations."" He believes his search for the perfect show is complete when he accidentally taps into a program called 'Videodrome' on a pirate satellite. Mesmerized by the display of graphic violence, Max sets out to find the person behind Videodrome, but not before it's deadly side effect takes over his life. This movie, althought semi-dated and cheesy at moments, it quite visually spectacular and a top notch, ahead of it's time psychological thriller, not to mention extremely graphic in a few scenes. Definately worth seeing."
4,"Not for everyone, but a must see for movie analysts.","I took a Cinema Studies course, and it helped me enjoy films on a whole new level. Now, I tend to analyze, and sometimes over-analyze, films. With this film though, it is close to impossible to over-analyze. There is so much there, and you can't possibly pick up on all of it in just one viewing. As a David Cronenberg fan, who has seen all of his films, I think this is one of his best (I also strongly recommend ""Dead Ringers"" with Jeremy Irons and Genvieve Bujold). In a nutshell, the film is about technology winning over nature. It's about the new technological human; James Woods character cheers ""long live the new flesh."" The movie comments on how technology corrupts. Try to pick up on all the sexual inuendos (which if you know Cronenberg, exit in all his work). One of James Woods' finest performances."
5,Prophet of the modern age . . .,"It is impossible to watch this film and walk away the same. One only has to transpose the mediums used circa 1983 (Television names, cathode ray) with their modern counterparts (usernames, plasma screen) to understand that this film is just as relevant to the electric playground in which we live now as it was then - if not moreso.Cronenberg is bloody brilliant. First time I sat at watched this film near the end of the 80s it took me a few weeks to stop thinking about it. Watching it again from the mid 90s onward, it has lost none of it's impact. It has, in fact, gained momemntum in the twenty-first century.LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH"
2,Sick,"I didn't like it. I suppose if you are sado-masochistic by nature, you might enjoy it. The plot was too broken, and I was disappointed with Howard Shore's music. His modern movie scores are much better. I just kept saying ""Yuk!"" and then laughing where it wasn't supposed to be funny. Sorry, but this film was just b.a.d. in my opinion."
2,What the Hell Was Videodrome?????,"This movie is really stupid. I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Debbie Harry's. This movie is like, wicked slow. I got soooooo bored, Debbie's not even on the screen 99% of the time. If you like Cronenburg, I suggest that you DO ADD THIS FLIM TO YOUR COLLECTION, for I think if you're into blood, gore, and tons of nudidy, this is O.K. If you're like me, and a Debbie Harry, Sonja Smiths, or James Woods fan, I think you should just rent it, and see how you like it. But if you want it NOW, this movie is alright to buy, I guess.RATED R, LOTS OF NUDIDY, and the movie revoles around a new ""underground"" TV show, in which these men in black leather, wipe and kill naked women, chained to a clay wall, so don't watch this if you can't handle that WEIRD stuff."
2,"WIERD, WIERd, WIErd, WIerd, Wierd, wierd.............","Confusing, silly and boring at times. Not that good."
2,YOU'LL EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT?,"Well, I hate it. This movie made no sense at all. I got this movie based on the reviews on [amazon.com], plus it had to be on at least five or so lists as, ""the most disturbing cinema I've seen"". Most disturbing? More like most confusing. I guess some of the people that make up these lists are kids. The fx were not that great and I was expecting to see a little more of Deborah Harry(preferably naked). She was hardly in the picture. There were scene's of endless discussion and the only good stuff in the movie was shown on a fuzzy t.v., that you could hardly see. Don't waste your time and money on this, instead go get an Ilsa flick. I've seen Troma movies that were better and more entertaning than this. The reason for two stars is that I do like James Woods and think he did a great job with a boring script. If this is the best Cronenberg flim(as some other reviewers wrote)than god help us."
1,Guaranteed to bring up your tv dinner!,"In the event of an emergency when watching this film, your empty popcorn bucket makes a useful vomitory aid. Your couch cushion can be used as a floatation device, when the bucket overflows, to drift yourself out of the living room and as far away from the tele as you can possibly get. You'll be sick to your stomach for sure knowing you've wasted good money on bile such as this!"
1,YYYYAAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!,"The only reason this got one star instead of none was the fact that James Woods was in it (plus you can't rate items with less than one star...). I felt like turning it off after the first ten minutes because it was so boring, but I decided to give a try. I would rather have my time back then say I watched that dull bit of movie making. I can't believe any of you would call this a classic. It's a classic piece of boring trash, and thats about it. Besides Woods, the acting was terrible, the storyline mundane, and what little special effects there were did not really impress. But I guess some people need to cling to a movie that stinks like this, just so they can tell people they think its a classic."
3,"not great, not bad.","This is the oldest of the collection, and least used now. The size is good. Length is almost perfect, girth is almost perfect. The thing that drops this down from great to just o.k. is the shape of the head. It has a strange shape to it that makes it a tad uncomfortable when you start to go down 8+ inches on it. I have dildos that are longer and thicker than this one that I can take all the way, but because of the shape of the head of this dildo I can't get it all the way in. This is a great dildo for the price, and if you have a shallow hole and won't be using more than 7 or 8 inches of this, then its a great buy for the price, but if you're looking for a deep probe dildo to really test the limits, there are plenty of other dildos out there in the 7 - 8 inch circumference range that are much better!"
5,AWESOME!!,"These are the best, I looked everywhere for them and was so happy to find them here! THANKS! These work very well as well as being easy to carry."
3,"Great quality, but edited versions!","Although I enjoyed watching these specials from 1972, they have been edited. The musical performances have been deleted from the DVD release. The quality of this DVD is excellent, but there should be notice on the jacket that these are edited programs."
3,"A fair book, but the ending was annoying....","I thought that this book was fairly written, but the ending left me wonder why I read the book. I mean, why do you read a book that doesn't even tell what happens to Mandy, or why Tracey was in jail? But I can't deny that it was well written with interesting Australian slang. I would recommend this book to Junior high or high school kids."
2,okay but not too special,"I just finished reading it, and I GUESS that the book was good, but what is up with the end? Did John Marsden get tired of writing? I really liked parts of the book. I could relate to Mandy and Tracey in some parts of the book.I wouldn't reccomend buying it, go check it out at the library if you really want to read it. It's also kind of hard to understand without knowledge of autraillian slang but I like the slang part, makes it more realistic. Maybe a glossary or something of the sort would help readers enjoy the book better? Hope the next book I read is better..."
2,Ok but with a horrible ending,"The book started out OK. You got to know a little more about each charater with each of their letters. I hated, though, that you NEVER found out some things like exactly why Tracey was in jail. The ending was very abrupt and left you with little idea of what had happened. To enjoy this book you are going to have to have an active imagination to fill in what is missing."
1,What a waste of time,This book was totally not worth reading. It was basically a bunch of pages full of PenPal letters.
1,This is a terrible Book!,"I can't understand why this novel was recommended to a friend of mine, and why it was a notable book for young adults per the ALA. This book is near ridiculous! The ending is a complete waste of time, making me wonder why I bothered in the first place, because the novel took the reader absolutely nowhere. We never get an insight into the reality of tracey's situation. Also, it's written in Australian slang, with no index, so you hav eno idea what a lot of the terms and abbreviations are. I do not recommend this book to any reader of any age."
5,Wow...is all i can say...,"This book was suprisingly good, i just couldn't put it down! the author kept you suspenseful till the end...i was in total awe after reading it. I recommand everyone to read it especially teenagers. Since this is the first book that i've read written by John Marsden I'm definitely convinced to read another or even all of his books! This is a MUST read!...bytheway I never knew this book took place in Australia...i always thought it was somewhere in NY (i don't know whatever gave me that thought), i quess i was too into the book to even notice that. :)"
4,This book was open ended,"I thought this book was strange at first, then as I got into it I thouroughly enjoyed it except for the fact that it leaves me with too many unanswered questions. I would like to share theories if anyone is interested"
4,"An intrigring, and catching book!",This book was so exiting that I couldn't put it down that I read it in two days! The words and details held my attention throughout the whole book. I couldn't put it down until I found out the mysteries behind the letters. I hope there is a sequel to this book that fills in the gaps between Mandy's and Tracey's letters.
5,I found it amazing.,"I somehow stumbled across this book, and I fell in love. I disagree with many of the other reviews posted here; I thought the ending was strong, although frustrating. It was so powerful...and I doubt that it would have been that powerful without it. You really must read this book. It is fantastic."
4,Excellent but confusing,"I thought this book was really fascinating and unique, although it was rather short. However, I was so confused in connection with the ending if ANYONE has an idea of what happened please email me! I would recommend this book to anyone. Yu're in for a lot of surprises!"
2,disappointing,"Disappointing-feel short of its potential. At best, this may be useful as an introduction or for pre-high school (which is its target). However, there are no maps and no charts, etc. The battle entries are very incomplete and not well organized. Additionally, the battle entries do not (generally) identify the campaign or conflicts in which they occurred. Additionally, the conclicts or campaigns have no comprehensive list of battles which occurred therein. The book provides certain facts but there is no attempt to help the reader organize those facts-so you get facts without proper context-a good encyclodedia should provide facts and context for those facts."
1,Poor value at 12 tracks only,"Potential buyers should note that there is another CD, Christmas In Vienna, issued a few years later, that seems to contain the meagre number of tracks from this disk, plus an additional 6 tracks, making for rather better value.There is also a VHS tape, very cheap at the time of writing this, also titled Celebration In Vienna and apparently containing the same performances, which may contain 75 minutes of playing time."
3,Pretty Decent,"I enjoy Jack Link's products, so I decided to try out the Chicken Fajita Tender Cuts. However, it turned out slightly disappointing. The first bag was good; it was a flavor I hadn't tasted before, and although I had been enjoying the Peppered and Sweet & Hot beef jerky the week before, I was looking forward to something new. However, the flavor isn't quite as addicting as the ones for beef jerky. On top of this, the meat (little sticks of chicken) was significantly greasier.I'd say it's definitely worth it to try out, but going 6 bags deep isn't a good idea unless if you're sure that you'll like it. I'm just finishing up my last pack since it wasn't too bad while it lasted, but I'll probably be sticking with the other jerky flavors on my next order."
1,Awful texture,"I love most jerky products, but the texture of this was just gross.... I couldn't eat more than a bite, and had to discard the entire pack."
4,Nice flavor,"I like Jack Link's products. I like this one for its taste. But most of the pieces I've tried have little pieces of fat in them, though not enough to make the product unacceptable. In fact there's much more meat than fat in the pieces. I'll still finish all 6 bags. It's just that for this one reason, I haven't given it more than 4 stars. I've never really liked fat. The taste, texture, and aroma of the product are very good."
3,"OK, nothing new.....dried-flavored beef","Jerky is NEVER worth the cost, so make sure you really like jerky before shelling out the super high price-per-pound. Or, do like us, and buy your own dehydrator and make your own jerky at a fraction of the cost.This product is moist, but almost too moist. Has flavor, but if you're use to finer foods, you'll find the flavoring tasting a bit 'cheap'.Our concern was/is this, what ""level of quality"" is the meat going into the bag? One never knows, hence, it's better to make at HOME."
5,Simply the best Jerkey I've ever tasted.,"This is a great product. The chicken fajita jerkey is delicious. The name was a bit confusing. I did not know that clip strip was the name of the strip they hang in the supermarket. I use it to hang them in the pantry. I will buy this again, great product."
1,Faulty scanning of first time derivative dots.,"I regret that I must give a 1 rating because the x and y components of velocity, which are represented in the book by dots over the x and y, are not distinguished from the coordinate variables, in some cases. That is, the dots are omitted in some but not all instances. This became apparent in a sentence that stated that the variables were (x, y, x-dot, y), where x-dot was written with a dot over the x. The second y should have read y-dot, which revealed that the process of converting the book to digital content had either failed to detect the dots that represented a first derivative, or else a filter had removed some of the dots as apparent visual blemishes.This review is intended to apply only to the Kindle version, which is defective. (I would give zero stars if I could, since equations that can not distinguish between variables and their first time derivative can not be understood.)"
2,Cute Costume / Material not great,"Quick shipping by vendor, costume cute, but material/fabric on the arms was very ""itchy / scatchy"" and ripped immediately so I had to buy another costume because my daughter would not wear it -- seems to run small & hat did not fit."
3,The Silver Stallion,"I'm spoiled rotten now that I have reaquainted myself with the Black Stallion videos! The Silver Stallion doesn't offer much in the way of a story or plot. The story was simply about a man who wanted to capture the stallion. If you like horses you will find them here. I think those beautiful, wild horses are something else. No, I can't say it is a movie with much to offer except horses and the problems the man (Russel Crowe) and others had in trying to capture it."
3,Not for sensitive children,"We rented this movie because my nearly 7 year old daughter LOVES horses and I figured with a G rating and good actors we couldn't go wrong. Well, it is beautiful and has a captivating story (although it could not hold my 5 year old's attention very well). But the ending was very upsetting to my daughter. She said to me ""I thought you said this was rated G!"" No doubt tonight and for some nights after I'll be dealing with the resulting nightmares... Just thought some parents might want to be forewarned."
4,A Pleasurable Jaunt in the Country,"I just saw this movie for the first time and definitely watch it again. I am sorry it is not out on DVD. The scenery in this flick is georgous and so is Russell Crowe. The horses were beautiful and wild. As a breeder of horses I was very disturbed at the fight sequences between the stallions. Since this movies is supposed to be a ""family oriented"" film I was surprised they showed such violence. Crowe again proves he doesn't need lines to project his masculinity."
4,"Lovely scenery, and good story line",I bought this for my nephew 6 yrs. He is a horse fanatic! Both he and his 8 year old sister enjoyed it. The horse fighting scenes were not overly disturbing to them. I myself enjoyed the beautiful scenery and footage of the horses was awesome. I felt though that the acting was left to be desired. All in all a great movie for horse loving kids.
5,Awsome Horses!!! Awsome Movie!!!,"For u horse lovers out there this is a definitly MUST SEE movie!!!! It's a GREAT story about a horse named Thowra which means wind, he was named that for the wind on the night on which he was born. One of the reviews said he dies in the movie....he doesn't die....they just made it seem like he dies, I won't say any more about the movie itself b/c I don't want 2 give anything away 4 u peeps that want to see it(lol). If u love horses then you'll love the way the horses are protrayed in the movie!!! They're so majestic and beautiful it's hard to describe....it's just one of those ""see"" movies to understand what I'm talking about. This is a definite family friendly movie!! If you have anybody that's horse crazy in your family....u absolutely HAVE to get this AWSOME movie 4 them!!!"
3,Great for little kids,"I bought this for my 2 yr old who is crazy about horses. This is a great movie for little kids. It is beautiful, the landscape and the horses are just amazing. That is the part my daughter likes. As for the story, it is lacking. I guess if you are a Russel Crow fan you might like this more than I do. He is rugged, handsome and young in this movie.(That is the first time I have said he is handsome)I on the other hand laugh at acouple of scenes(""I've got your daughter Stallion!"")if you have seen this movie you know what I'm talking about."
4,Wonderful movie,"Wonderful movie for horse lovers. Russell Crowe is great as usual. There's no vulgarity, which is more and more a rarity even in ""family"" movies. There's some fantasy elements as the main horse seems to have unusual intelligence and power."
4,Silver Stallion,I love Russell Crowe which helps. Very 'Man from Snowy River' Australian story which has all the drama and action that kept my 7 year old riveted to the movie. Definitely a favourite of hers as the story is told from mother to daughter in language that she understands....there is little dialogue but the photography is outstanding and supports the story beautifully.
4,Well done adaptation of the book,"Although this is a very well-done adaptation of Elyne Mitchell's Silver Brumby book, I did not give it 5 stars as I felt it could have focused more on the horses than the people. However, it showed life through the horses' eyes very well, and the potential cruelty of man (without needlessly dwelling on the latter). The human actors were for the most part well-acted (except for the young girl), but the horses outshone them all. I will not hesitate to purchase this video for my own neice. The cinematography is really breathtaking, and I only wish it were available of widescreen or DVD.Thowra lives!"
5,A wonderful movie!,"I thought this was a wonderful movie and have seen it over and over. It's a special treat for people who truly know a lot about horses in the terms they use, but is still enjoyable for every horse lover. The story is very unique and about the beautiful brumbies of Australia and thier hardships as horses. I'd describe it as a ""mustang Black Beauty"" and a must see for horse-lovers!"
4,Breathtaking cinematography and beautiful horses.,"I read the book many years ago in 6th grade and it is still one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, it is out of print and very hard to find, even in Australia. This movie follows the main story line of the book, but from a more human viewpoint. It chronicles the writing of the book with scenes of the author, Elyne Mitchell, and her daughter interspersed with the scenes of the story and the horses it chronicles. I would have preferred to have more of the horse story and less of the human one (hence the 4 star rating.) If you liked ""The Man from Snowy River"", also based on the book by Elyne Mitchell, or just like to watch gorgeous horses running through beautiful scenery, you'll love this one."
3,3 1/2 Stars Beautiful Film,"...Beautifully simple children's story? What do we respect? How do we learn to respect nature?...this has been mentioned as another version of ""The Man From Snowy River"", I have no problem with that. Australian's do love their horses and they make really exceptional films about them. ""Phar Lap"" is another wonderful example of these films.It's nice to get alittle Australia in your veins and visit the bush and the High Country for a time.In this film Mr. Crowe had some real competition on screen. It was from the animal stars, fortunately, there seemed to be some real bonding between Russell and his animal co-stars. His dog seemed to really love him as did his horses. If you've ever had a pet or worked on a film you know that this is not always the easiest thing to catch on film.The riding was great fun, the scenery spectactular, covering the seasons in the high country and the horses were breathtaking..."
1,Terrible,"Very slow plot. Characters not developed enough. Not enough dialogue.Love the Man from Snowy River so checked this movie out. But is not comparable at all! Would not watch ever again, not even for the scenary."
1,The Silver Stallion,The Silver StallionAnother boring movie. Not a good example of how horses really interact with humans.
1,Looking for a good horse story....this is NOT it!,Could not get past the first 15 minutes of this movie. It is just bad. Enough said.
1,Disappointed,Bought this for my 4 yr old son that loves... horses. It is very dark - and for him it was hard to understand. I thought the production of it was bad. I was just really disappointed.
4,Why I bought this movie,"I bought this movie for 1 reason: Russell Crowe. Not only can he act, he's gorgeous & he's my age. The film gave him nothing to do & the story made him sound like he was a villian. His character did nothing in the story to deserve that. Then, they needed a better looking actress to play the daughter."
3,There were horses in this movie?,"Somehow I never got past the scene when Russell Crowe bathes in the river and takes a nap with his dog on his chest. Seriously...like other readers I watched this movie because Russell Crowe is, in my opinion, the best actor working today. I ended up enjoying the scenery and the gentle story. It was a nice, relaxing movie that parents can enjoy with their kids. Most movies for kids are sloppy and idiotic. This one had a genuine love for these magnificent animals and the land they inhabit. I really enjoyed it."
1,The Silver Stallion,Sorry but I was not impressed with this movie. I thought there would be more beautiful scenery. Maybe Snowy River just spoilt me. That had the scenery. I felt it was a little dull. It was not an entire waste of time and for those who like a quiet movie it might be okay but I would not view it again.
5,Russell and Horses Horses Horses...,"Horses, horses, horses and Russell Crowe!! It's enough to make a-not-so-grownup women swoon. Yes! I admit it. I bought it for Russell. But as a horesewomen, I fell in love with horses all over again. They were magnificent! ...and so was the country. ...and then of course Russell Crowe. His passion shows even in this quiet role... his riding was exhilarating (though a little sloppy with the lower leg)... he exhibits a wonderful rapport with animals... he brings Clarity and depth to his character (even Thirty Odd Foot away)... sorry Russell I couldn't resist. This is a great story, beautifully filmed...the pace is perfect... better than Black Beauty... oh such sacrilege!! but you see this has Russell Crowe."
3,It's okay.,"It's really not for learning japanese, as much as it is learning aboutthe Japanese. It is helpful if you have something else to go with it."
1,Pirated Copy,"This was a copy, a cheap one at that, it wouldn't play and was VERY expensive. Do NOT purchase from this seller!"
4,Cute Movie,"It was a cute movie. Definately not the best, but not the worst either. I remember loving it as a kid and loved the idea of a dirtbike that has a mind of it's own. My nephews may like it so I'm going to check it out and buy it for them. :)"
5,Best movie of the 80's!,I remember the first time I saw this movie it was on The Disney Channel. It came on that channel a lot and everytime when it was on I would just watch it all the time. It has the kid Ralhpie from A Christmas Story in it and he's great in this. The scariest part of this movie was that nightmare of that hot dog statue that scared the kid that kind of scared me a lil when I was lil not much anymore though since I'm 23 now. I wanted a bike like that back then in the 80's but now that it's 2004 and that the 80's are gone I'm sure they don't have those bikes around anymore but this movie brings back the memories everytime I watch it. I hope they do a DVD release for this movie because I will just buy it when it comes out. It's such a great movie.
3,"Good Movie, Avoid buying this DVD for a very high price","This DVD can be purchased from vintageshack for $15.99 I bought one on ebay for $20, the quality was poor, it was like a worn out VHS quality on DVD. I could tell it is not an official dvd release that was ever in stores. In fact a VHS copy of this movie may have better picture quality then the DVD, at least the VHS is official. The DVD is a laserdisc transfer. The one for sale on Amazon at $200 may be official since it is sealed, my ebay copy came like new however it was the exact same artwork."
4,dirt bike kid,Yes old school movie still just as good then as now kids loved it its a good family movie for the young kids 5 an older will love it
1,Trivial and unfriendly,"This book is very much the same as the other books on the subject of teaching English as a foreign language. Some chapters may even appear to say exactly the same as previous authors. But in some aspects this book is quite original. It starts with an outburst of patriotic praise of the English language.You get the message that the world speaks English and we must teach the very few who are so unfortunate not to so so yet. What about them, your students? You are advised not to be preconceived, to avoid stereotypes. Unfortunately the book does precisely what it tells you not to do. It says that the Arabs are too demanding, the Spaniards get too excited, and so on, complaining about different nationalities. In my view this book is rather trivial and too unfriendly."
1,I took it back,"This book starts with an outburst of British patriotism, everyone speaks the language, but on reflection we are trying to teach it to the poor folks who dont speak it yet. Then these folks and their teachers are thoroughly patronized, they are all stupid, but this book will guide everyone. Very unpleasant reading. Some information is biased and clearly flawed."
2,Not the best!,"There is a lot of information in this book, the same you find in others on the same topic. And I have read them all! Two things I do not like in this one. It appears to expect the EFL teacher to be totally incompetent and tends to state the obvious in a very patronising tone. It tells you what a CV is:""A CV is a record of your education, training, emplyment and related aspects of your life..."". It tells you that you should find out the address of a chemist before you go abroad just in case you fall ill. And more advice of the same nature and at the same level. The other thing I do not like is that it appears to borrow from other books on the topic but I cannot find any acknowledgements."
1,"Misleading title, meager information, don't bother buying this DVD","There is no information of interest to boaters, on the ICW, in this DVD. It features some quite typical and already prominent tourist attractions accessible from the ICW, including 5 minutes spent on a soup recipe!Buy a tourist's city guide to Charleston, or Savanna, but don't buy this DVD (especially new!). And, the cover offers me host ""Jonathan Edwards"" - whether the musician celebrity or not, there is no J. Edwards in this DVD. As I write this, I'm trying to uncheck the one star I gave it."
3,Cowabunga dude!,"Growing up, GI Joes and Transformers was the item to have. And then one day, this cartoon called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comes out and new toys are on the market. Needless to say, the older generation of toys was blown off the shelves and made room for these heroes on the halfshell. If you are looking for some nostalgia or a great fun cartoon for your kids to enjoy, then pick this up and order some pizza. Ralpheal is cool, but rude. Michaelangelo is a party dude. Leonardo leads, and Donatello does machines. That about sums about the character traits, but this is a great story/viewing that shows the first 5 episodes from the original cartoon from the 1980's. With Shredder, Splinter the rat, April O'Neil, Krang the Brain from Dimension X, Baxtor Stockley, Bebop and Rock Steady, General Kragg, and the Neutrinos. Great from start to finish."
5,MY SON LOVES IT,My son loves this movie.. It arrived promptly and the price was great. He watches this all the time. :-)
4,Nostalgia kick,"I was surprised and pleased to find this on amazon, as I haven't seen the series since I was little. I used to watch it every afternoon after school. Brought back some memories."
1,help,"Sorry, I screwed up!! I thought that I was ordering a game for my Grandson, NOT a video on demand!! I don't have anything to watch it on nor do I want it. What do I do to give it back and get my $4.99 back? Thank You very much. SOrry I goofed it up!! James L. Berry Jberry860@gmail.com"
3,movie quality is par for yr it was created,movie quality was par for the year it was created. i was disappointed on the download of this movie. it's a format I cannot reuse on my iPad. requires internet connectivity to view for me on the amazon app. doesn't work for a moving vehicle with child.
4,fun,Got this for my 4 year old son. He loves all the Ninja stories and has watched the movie repeatedly.
5,My son loves it,It isn't quite as violent as the new cartoon that is on TV now. He is 5 years old and Loves turtles.
3,Cute....but not the best.....,"I liked this cartoon, but I find the new toon to be much more appealing. This one is all fun and games, all humor, not so good animation (but because it's an 80's cartoon that's okay), and has deeply stupid villans. I hate stupid villans, it's one of the main reasons why I had stopped watchings shows like the Power Rangers!Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad show. Last month my friends and I rented a couple of old toon tapes, and we enjoyed it a lot. It's funny, although sometimes it crosses over into being corny, and nice to watch.But when it comes down to which show is better, new toon or old toon...The new one is #1! I don't understand how anyone who has seen both versions can say that the old toon is better, because it just isn't. It's far from it! Which is why I gave it this rating."
3,"Hasn't aged well, but still fun","I used to love the Ninja Turtles when I was younger. I decided to watch a few episodes for the 25th anniversary of the show. Sadly, it hasn't aged well. The animation is OK, but there are a lot of obvious errors and points where the animation doesn't look like it aligns with the background. The dialogue is very corny. Worst of all, it's tough to take Shredder seriously knowing he's voices by James Avery of Fresh Prince. Splinter also seems lot goofier than the wise rat I remember. I can see why Eastman and Laird renounced this cartoon.Despite this, it's still a fun series for kids. There's a lot of action, slapstick jokes, and cool creature designs. I'd recommend it for kids, but adults seeking to go on a nostalgia trip might be disappointed."
4,FINALLY THE ORIGINAL TMNT !!!!,"Finally the original Teen aged mutant ninja turtles!!! I made sure I got this DVD as soon as it came out. This is definatly one of the best cartoons ever made. I'm glad to finally see it on dvd, I can't stand the new series.This cartoon takes place in what I think is the greatest era of cartoon making and animation the mid 80's early 90's. It is about time They start apperaing on dvd.The early TMNT is a 5 star quality show, the reason I give it a 4 is the DVD itself isn't the greatest. This dvd should have came in a 1st and 2nd season box set. the dvd contains all the 5 episodes of season 1, and 4 bounus episodes of season 6 I belive.This DVD would be a sin not to own, for any cartoon fan!! (...)All I say is put the rest of the original series coming to DVD.TURTLE POWER!!!"
4,only watch the first set of episodes,"This dvd has the very first five episodes and then four of the very last ones. Don't watch the last ones; they are ridiculous. The first ones are classic, though. Definitely worth watching. This DVD is good if you REALLY need the episodes on DVD right away. I'm sure that, given time, a good set will be released with more episodes on it and some extras, but for anyone who strongly desires the episodes right now(like myself) this is a decent set.I only watched two of the four last episodes. I had to stop. I don't think I'll ever watch the other two unless I get extremely bored."
3,A little short,"Compared to the other volumes for this, this one really seemed to be lacking in quantity of videos. The extra episodes that weren't released on TV weren't released for a reason: they're a little stupid and pointless.I'm a great fan of this part of my childhood and I would still recommend getting this, just don't get your hopes too high expecting something fantastic."
5,TMNT - Original Series (Season 1),"The first 5 episodes of the series, which complete the first season, and 4 bonus episodes that were never aired.. that are from the 10th season made in 1996. The only bad thing about that is that I don't have the 10th season, so I was watching them without knowing what was going on. I'm gonna have to wait a looong time for the 9th and 10th season to come out on DVD."
5,Fast and reliable,I received the dvd in a timely matter and at a reasonable price. I also enjoyed the teenage mutant ninja turtles dvd because I used to watch it as a kid. It brought back some memories. Enjoy!
4,TMNT Series Vol 1,Glad they have this on streaming . Quality is good but I wish each episode was separated . Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles .... Heroes in a half shell ~ Turtle Power!
5,AT LAST,"I have been waiting for this for nearly eight years, and finally the moment I've waited for has come. The classic cartoon from the 80s and 90s finally goes on Digital Video Disk, and I couldn't be happier. Being a loyal fan of the series, I would constantly watch over my old videos and recordings of this, wishing I had a season collection to see the few episodes I actually missed, and get the ones I had lost after all this time. And now, the moment has finally come. No offense, but as the good as the new show is, it just doesn't have the certain charm this show did. Plus, we can't forget the catchy theme song, something, ""1, 2, 3, 4, Turtles!,"" fails to live up to. It's going to take forever until April....."
4,TMNT are and will be awesome!,I watched this show as a kid and while I may view it throught Nostalgia Goggles I love this season. The Turtles are by far the greatest heroes for kids and I will always love them.
5,THE BEST SHOW EVER!!,"this show is awesome, its about 4 mutated turtles and attempts to defeat shredder and get back to normal pet shop turtles! this is the first time seeing this show on dvd! i want to say that this show is very classic. you can notice the drawing mistakes on some episodes! one episode leo appears out of nowhere! and another episode, the foot soldiers disappear and come back! so, this show has a few mistakes, who cares? back then it was the first season and they didn't know what they were doing then. then this turned into a show that everyone loved! people that loved this show when they were kids can love it again with this dvd! now its time to collect the VHS tapes since now you can get this on DVD. what i'm really trying to say is to buy this DVD today!"
3,Good for what it is.,"This was one of the first reference books I picked up when I moved to Florida from up North, and it's been a valuable resource for identifying common flora and fauna in an unfamiliar region. Now that I AM familiar with the area, however, this guide isn't nearly as useful. Several times in the past month I have seen unfamiliar animals and insects (in my new affection for walking), and they haven't been included here.The book includes the life that is COMMON to Florida, but if you have a desire to identify less common animals and plants, it's probably better to stick with the specialised field guides. Audubon usually does a better job than this, and make a few other books that are well put together and more inclusive than this one."
4,Great overall educational guide to Floridas' wildlife,"Great book to keep in your car. Whenever I see something I don't recognize, I usually find it in this book. I've identified many plants and animals using this book."
4,Good basic overview,"A good basic overview of FL natural life. Most of what you come across on a general glance will be found in this book.Having grown-up in FL and most of that in the country working with scientists of one stripe or another I know there is much more to be found here. However, if you are looking for a general field guide that is easy to use on the trail you could do far worse than this book."
3,Book that finally came.,This book did finally arrive after waiting almost a month for its arrival. The book fits the purpose of identifying a variety of things in my new state of Florida.
4,Best of its type,"On moving to Florida I made a thorough search for a compendious book on the state's flora and fauna. This turned out to be by far the best book of that nature. The only shortcoming of this book is that the illustrations are quite small, and thus many of them do not do the best possible job in depicting a particular animal or plant. This is an inexpensive ""handbook."" A larger and more thorough version of this guidebook would be most welcome, but I was never able to find any such thing."
2,A general book on derivatives designed for the casual reader,"This book was very dissapointing to me. I consider myself well read but a novice at derivatives. This is a book of speeches made by its author and is focussed on making the point that derivatives are a cheap insurance tool for certain situations and like all tools can be misused. There is the usual polemics of why a mandarinate government like Japan cannot manage a twenty first century country and why China should reject this form of development. I found the book lacking in rigor, insight and relatively low on substance. This book compares roughly to a sunday newspaper article from a not very good newspaper."
2,3D Home Design Review - Impossible to use,"I have a masters degree in technology but this software package is incredibly hard to use. I had high hopes of being able to design my new home but was disappointed on how non-intuitive this software is to use. After spending 15 hours and only having a few walls captured, we gave up and decided hiring an architect was easier. I would love a software package that was able to pull together a house design but this package did not work."
2,Not for the regular Joe Home Owner,"Might be a good product, but too hard to use for theregular Joe Home Owner."
2,Great if you have previous experience...,"Not as user friendly as say the Better Homes and Garden home designer, but it does convert to CAD. Takes a lot of patience that I didn't have."
2,Not much to it,"I was expecting something like what Beth Moore writes, this was nothing. It's short and you can't read the charts the writing is so small. It doesn't go into much detail either. If you are looking for a deep Bible study I wouldn't recommend this."
2,Ultimately Unsatisfying,"This is a rehash of the Ravenloft core campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons 3.5. It turned out to be a great disappointment. The flaws are:- It is lacking in new material. if you are going to pay this musch for a book, you don't really want to find that most of the material can be found virtually word-for-word in the previous release.- It is not a Player's Handbook. I don't expect a Player's Handbook to include templates for key Ravenloft villains. Player's will see the title, and have access to all the key qualities of major villains.If you have the original core campaign book I suggest you save your money."
3,Haters need not hate,"There is a certain paradox involving this roleplaying book. Most reviews I have read have slammed it, long time fans in particular loathe it. This is curious, because the Ravenloft Players' Handbook basically is a retread of the Ravenloft Campaign Setting, which most fans adore. I think it's a case of messing with a good thing. White Wolf was apparently legally obligated to convert their d20 3.0 edition Campaign Setting book into 3.5, so they reprinted that volume, along with a few optional rules and some new artwork. The problem is the new optional rules are Horrible. Painful, really. Some of the new artwork is nice, but really; do yourself a favor and pick up the previous edition instead."
3,does not look like image,"the fabric of the shoe looks like a fishing net, does not look good close but looks good when put.The size is right but they would not stay on my feet, and are a little hard. They're good to go by car, not walking."
1,poor condition,this watch came without a box or paperwork. It did not work. I took it to a jewleler and he replaced the battery and said it was missing the rubber gasket which keeps it waterproof. I could not get a replacement gasket from Nike. The watch now keeps time with the new battery but it is not waterproof as advertised.
2,Dispenser design really bad,"Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry"
3,Charlotte,You had better really enjoy history if you plan on getting through this entire book. Has some wonderful details of the era. I don't really care for the turn of the century method of conversation. The first 10 pages of introduction and outlines of the coming work is completely unnecessary. They read like the Cliff notes version of a book.
5,Monarch,"This album took a long time to grow on me, and while it's a bit raw and the singer's voice is a little rough on a lot of the songs, I like the whole album, and like the songs Monarch and Logic Bomb so much I had to give the album 5 stars as I consider it a must own.The singer and guitarist went on to form the band Tinstar (not the country band) with songs that sound more pop-like and many songs like Logic Bomb off this album. They released 2 albums as Tinstar, Thrill Kisser and Dirty Bird.They went on to form the band Jok, though I haven't had much chance to listen to that incarnation."
3,Mic sucks.,Headphones are awesome.mic sucks. it is very very quiet..I turned the volume up on my comp.. and its still quiet.
1,Beware of this Item,"Generally i dont write the reviews. But really for this item, i felt like writing.Beware !!!!!!!!!. MIC Does not work. Mute does not function at all, whether it is off or on. Sound is OK if you keep it low. If you keep it high, then sound is horrible. Think twice before you buy...."
1,This is bad,"I've never written a review on a product before, but this one is so bad I feel I should warn others. The speakers sound great, and the voume control works. That's where the fun ends. The mute button for the microphone doesn't work. Also, the line has a short in it somewhere, every time I breathe I get tons of static. Even with the microphone on ""mute"". I know that it didn't cost a lot of money, and this just proves you (don't) get what you (don't) pay for."
2,Not worth it,"I am taking masters classes on line and need to use the headset for presentations and the like but these initally did quite well and then they just stopped working. The Mic would not pick up anything so I sent them back and tried another pair and the samething happened. So, now I need to find a different headset. These don't come with any drivers to install so it's just a windows generic type setting. I think if they had some install program and some drivers it might have been a different story. They are comfortable and the sound is great but if you can't be heard, what's he point. I think cyber acoustics is a good company and produces a good headset but they missed the mark this time."
2,Go for the complete works,"Edgar Allan Poe is one of America's greatest writers. He is an absolute master of the short story and the poem. A collection of Poe's writings is a welcome addition to any bookshelf. I would not, however, chose this particular collection.Because all of his works fit handsomely in a single volume, there is no real need to purchase a ""selected works"" version like this one. There are other ""value priced"" editions that have everything and you will be better off with one of them. Look for the term ""complete works.""Poe's writings do not disappoint, but this presentation of his writings does."
5,This book is the best horror and sci-fi book of all time.,"Edgar A.Poe's book""Works of Edgar Allan Poe"" is a classic book of sci-fi and detective stories as well as the works he's most famous for. Anyone can get into it, even if they are 14 like me. The plots are unique and mind boggling, each story involving the complexity of the human mind."
2,not their best stuff,"First I need to say that I am a big gsw fan. I must say however that this album just doesnt do it for me. If you're one of those people who will buy a cd because of one song, then ""ru4real?"" might be enough cause to buy this one. It was for me. The rest of the album was a bit of a let down, but I must stress that this album (nor it's reviews) should stop you from buying any other gsw albums. ""bag"" and ""god street wine"" are both absolutely fantastic."
1,God Street rocks but this album is terrible!!!!!,I have seen this band over 25 times and they are killer! I feel bad for the listeners of this album who think that this is an accurate representation of this fine band. Check out the earlier and live albums to get drunk on God Street Wine. SEE THIS BAND LIVE!!!!
3,Musically detailed,"A good introduction to the Wagner operas, with some interesting anecdotes. Much of the book is score which I don't read, but if you do it's a big plus. As a lifelong Wagner fan most of the rest was familiar territory. I would recommend a good biography first, e.g. Derek Watson, Hans Gal and/or Bryan Magee."
3,To much info,The book in itself is good and informative. It just has alot of information to wade through as a laymen. It seems more for professionals. It gives alot of information about the disorder I've just been researching the subject for awhile and getting tired. Now in all fairness I have not finished the book. I believe every body is different and one must experience the book for themselves.
5,One of the best books I have ever read,I am a US military veteran served during the Vietnam era I suffer from post dramatic stress syndrome in this book was very helpful for me
3,"Good book, but the POST TSD SOURCEBOOK BY GLEN SCHRALDI","IS MUCH BETTER. This book discusses what PTSD is, but not how to treat it like the (PTSD) sourcebook does."
5,AMAZING!,This stuff really works! It writes on the sidewalk much better than the rocks I used as a kid. And in different colors too! Kids today have it so easy!
5,Exactly what it says it is,"Received non-lubricated condoms as ordered. Shipping was discrete and fast. Thinner latex than Trojan non-lubricated condoms. Everything else about performance and the like is a matter of personal preference. I will say that there were no issues to report, no breakages, condoms were WELL within expiration date on package. A great bargain."
4,Perfect gift,This made a perfect wedding gift to a couple I knew for years. I'm very sure they will use it for years to come. Serves the purpose well but I think its a little expensive. You pay the price for the brand I guess.
3,Not what I expected (rust spots),We have had this flatware for ten months now. It has always been washed in the dishwasher using Finish Powerball Tabs. Never anything with lemon. The knives show spots of rust and have since the second week or two of use. The problem does not seem to be getting any worse with usage. The other pieces do not appear to have this problem.This is a rather heavy flatware in my estimation. This particular pattern has corners on the handles that are a bit uncomfortable when cutting something on your plate. I would try another brand next time.
3,Good information.,"That's all, just good info.I kept waiting for the part where he invented the wheel.That happens in any first account, I just needed the minimum amount of words."
1,Tedious,"If you are hoping to learn more about Mitt's personal life, this is not your book. If you want tedious minutiae regarding the long-forgotten Salt Lake City Olympics, this is the book for you. As we enter a new presidential election, I was hoping to learn more about this candidate, why he makes the decisions he does, and to get a sense of who he is on a personal level. To my disappointment, I didn't learn anything of interest -- just that he has a lot of money and is good at delegating."
2,CD-ROM: 125 pages,"Dear Entrepreneurs:Please be aware that this ""CD-ROM"" includes ONE poorly formatted 600k .doc file and its .pdf copy. This file consists of four variations of ""Venture Capital Term Sheet"", 34 pages of explanations and obvious ""Summary of Terms"". The page size is 5.5"" x 8.5"" which is exactly of the regular page. Despite of the most of this information could be freely found on the Internet, I would gladly pay for this document $10. Editorial Review is misleading. I'm sending it back."
2,Boring... just real boring,"The basic concept of this story was interesting. The Olympics are exciting... unfortunately, 150 pages dedicated to a line-by-line analysis of an Olympic budget is not exciting. Nor is the constant name-dropping of international CEOs and executives. Nor is the re-affirmation every 40 pages that Mitt sacrificed a lot by leaving his multi-billion dollar private equity firm to work for the Olympics and the accompanying statement that he was blessed enough in his life to be able to afford to make that sacrifice.I gave this book two more stars than I wanted to because a) Amazon won't let me give a book zero stars and b) I like the Olympics.This book does accomplish one thing: It's a 400-page long example of just how detached from the average voter Mitt really is."
2,Pre-nomination Mitt...,"With a title like ""turnaround"" I was expecting Mitt to explain why he has reversed all of his positions on abortion, sexuality etc just in time for the Republican nomination.Unfortunately not.This book is about a simpler time when Mitt did not have to reverse or hide all of his principles in order to seek higher office. It tells the story of his rescue of the Olympic Games. It is actually quite good (although Mitt takes a LOT of the credit for things that others did). Unfortunately, it also reflects on the ""old"" Mitt rather than the Mitt 2.0 who is running for the nomination today..."
3,* * * 1/2 stars,"This was a 4.5 star movie right up until the end. Plot holes galore!Spoilers ~Can anyone tell me why the kidnappers lied about killing Pita and why they kept her alive but didn't ask for more money or tell anyone? Why did Creasy have to give himeself up to them? It was unecessary, he had more than enough to negotiate with.Everything about this movie was great except for the ending that tries too hard to be dramatic.I would still recommend this movie because of the top notch performances from all the actors and actresses and the stylish look of the movie."
2,VERY DEPESSING,This movie had the making of 5 stars till the end. The screen writer needs to go back to school and learn how to write happier movies. This did not have a good ending. That is all I can say.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE'S ! ! ! !,"Thrilling. Worth it and very, very interesting and powerfull ! ! YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH THIS ONE URGENTLY. One of the best movies ever made in history. Personally one of my favorite's. I think this one is the best DENZEL WASHINGTON flick he has ever done. Watch this one NOW !!!!I beg you. If you like suspensful movies, this is it, ""THE"" movie for you. BUY IT NOW ! ! ! !You won't regret at all !"
4,Man on Fire,"Man on Fire had an interesting plot, with Denzel playing a burn-out ""professional soldier"" with no direction and emotions.After establishing a relationship as a bodyguard (a position new and way beneath his training) for a young child, he begins to open up and distinguish emotions and feelings. Only after this child's kidnapping and Denzel being critically injured, as well as his belief the child has been killed, does he seek out and administer retribution.Overall, an excellent movie."
4,Bodyguard,"This isn't the first bodyguard movie, but it is certainly a good one. Denzel Washington is great playing a moody ex-CIA assassin that becomes a bodygurad for a wealthy Mexicans little girl. Pita played by Dakota Fanning is wonderful as that little girl. Denzel teaches her how to win in a swimming competition and she changes his life. Lots of character development here with some intense action especially three quarters of the way into the movie. Fans of Washington won't want to miss this one. Fans of movies like ""Proof of Life"", ""The Bodyguard"", ""Eraser"" or the Tom Clancy books/movies should like it. All the support cast is excellent and the side stories of their lifes added to the overall entertainment. I was surprised to see the dedication to the main character at the end. Apparently it is loosely based on a true story. This movie is gritty and sometimes hard and bloody. It should not be viewed by small children."
4,Ending Was Disappointing,A very entertaining movie with a disappointing ending. The characters were very well developed and the action was almost non-stop.
4,"first smoke, then fire!","2/3s of this movie smolders. the last 1/3 is FIRE. i was a bit concerned that this was not one of denzel's better ones. well, it is and stands well alongside his other ""action"" movies. always, always like to see christopher walken...in my opinion our generation's own peter lorre!!"
2,Could Have Been So Much Better,"Two stars for the acting and story, no stars for the way the story was shot. I am surprised with how much money was spent making this film on how poorly the cinematography was done. I know we are living with the MTV and post-MTV generation, but you don't need to make the shots that jerky and ADD."
1,Faulty Blu-ray,"I had seen the movie before and wanted to get a good quality blu-ray disc. The blu-ray shipped did not play on Sony BDP 350 and kept playing the trailer over and over again. I couldn't even get to the top level menu.I ordered a replacement hoping to get a disc that works, but it turned out to have the same problem as the previous one. I don't have issues playing any other blu-ray disks on the player. Either these discs were not compatible with the player or it's just a bad batch of blu-ray discs."
1,No Extras!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I will not buy any Blu-Ray DVD's that do Not Include extras that Standard DVD's include. All the talk about being able to hold so much space on Blu-Ray and they do not include extras............what a joke.
2,Good story - poorly photographed,Acting and story are great. The cinematography is just dreadful. It has the look and feel of an undergraduate student film project.
3,A picture every second,This is a good movie but how the director or whoever is responsible for the flashing of the scenes so fast it gives you a headache ought to be taken out and shot. Maybe they are proud that they can show there technology of flashing scenes but it stinks. I turn off the commericals that do this and I hope everybody complains about it.
3,This would've been FAR better,"if Scott would stop trying to be so damn clever and pseudo-artistic and just direct the damn film. His ridiculous cutaways, speed-ups, distorted angles, strange lighting and COMPLETELY unnecessary subtitles might seem cool to the inexperienced, but if you are a true film fan, you soon realize that none of it adds anything to the film other than make it harder to watch. Denzel, Walken, Fanning, Mickey and even Anthony turn in good performances. The others are just kind of there. As far as the plot goes, it's OK. (Warning! Possible spoiler ahead). A lot of it seems retread from a lot of other revenge films, and I have just one question: with all the other firepower he bought, did Creasy ever hear of bulletproof vests? Duh...."
4,What a Film!,"Wow. Two of my five top favorite actors in the same film, Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. I was suprprised to learn that Warner Brothers did this film, as it is remeniscent of a 70s independent film type framing.Definitely a film for mature audiences, and though I am not a fan of gore and guts, I feel it was done superlatively. Lets face it. The movies of the 21st century are so filled with fantasy, graphics, and animation, that we have forgotten what true artists are able to do. Both Washington and Walken are true to their artform in this film. Raw? Perhaps. Sullen? Sure. But lets face it, the basic ""the bad guys get it and the hero win"" is classic film legacy.The only reason I did not give this movie five stars is because when speaking spanish, the subtitles flashed and disappeared before I had much of a chance to read them.Otherwise, got a two thumbs up!"
5,Excellent movie,"Strong plot and good character development, excellent ending that wraps the movie up well, would definitely recommend to anyone else."
3,"Denzel pulls it together, but I hate Hollywood endings","Nice plot development, which sets up for nice action sequences towards the end of the movie. Denzel does his job like no other, and he was very convincing in this movie. I was disappointed with the end, because it didn't fit the nature of the bad guys, buy the good guy's sacrifice was expected and a little touching. It's a nice movie to see once, but it's pretty straight forward so you shouldn't have too many questions, unless you fall asleep during the development phase (45min - 60min)."
4,Violent but Spiritual?,"My friend recommended this film as one of the most spiritual movies she has ever seen. Denzel Washington gives a strong performance as a broken Christ-figure, John Creasy. Dakota Fanning holds her own as the child he is employed to protect. She is from a wealthy family, but is not type-cast as spoiled or naive.In fact, it is her character, Pita, who saves John - from his initial broken-heart, suicidal guilt, and unglamorized drunkeness. Then she is abducted and murdered. John works his way through the convoluted and corrupt system responsible for the abduction of Pita (and countless other children).This ""work"" is intensely violent. Probably it is too much to say a Christ-figure would cut someone's fingers off one by. But there is a righteousness to his burning anger. Perhaps this *is* some sort of god - one of angry justice, demanding that those of evil and darkness reconcile for their deeds."
3,Man on Fire not as bad as it looks,"I was skeptical because,let's be honest, Dakota Fanning is not exactly equated with Hollywood's finest. But Denzel Washington carries her through the movie, with his talent and appeal.Denzel plays the lead character Mr. Crazy (I think it is supposed to be ""Creasy,"" but the characters have poor annunciation and its funnier to think of it as Crazy), who is a hired bodyguard for a little girl in Mexico City. Of course everything falls to hell, and he is left seeking revenge on a kidnapping syndicate.The movie is a revenge story, and that is made clear when Crazy declares ""Revenge is a meal best served cold,"" which of course is not how the line is traditionally said (think ""dish"" not ""meal""). Beyond that it has some funny moments and it's gorey moments, but it is definately worth seeing just for the rectal bomb... don't ask."
4,This one brings out all the emotions,"This is a definite see. You will cringe, laugh, cry, and cheer in this film. The movie was edited great you'll notice this. It reminded me of how Gladiator was paced...quick shots of the past. Acting is great from all the cast even Mark Anthony. The story is sharp and keeps you wanting more. A few torture scenes that are hard to watch but overall this film is a great action story that will have you emotionally drained at the end. Go rent it!!"
5,Action with Heart,"The film moves from one scene to the next fluidly...it makes sense, but keeps you wondering what's around the corner. The photography and editing are very good (I believe) and the acting is awesome all the way around. Denzel is superb. Dakota is great! Everyone plays their part well and it's totally believable. A great story to read or watch. Soundtrack and music fit, too. I've lived in Mexico City and they've captured the essence of what it was like when I was there. I loved this film and will get it when it comes out on DVD."
4,Good Guilty Pleasure,If you travel to Mexico City a lot this film will scare you. There were a lot of liberties taken with the criminal underground in the film but the danger of kidnapping there is all too real. This is a good action film... good drama. It will probably be Dakota Fanning's best performance of her lifetime. If you have seen her lately on talk shows you will notice that she is quickly becoming a paper clown. She is now 12 and acts like a Hollywood 50 year old and it is kind of creepy to say the least. It's like she aspires to be strewn through the ringer like Drew Barrymore by the time she's 21. Denzel Washington does a great job here. Great drama... fun twists... painful to watch in parts but a good film.
3,146 MINUTES OF ...see review,"It's a good film, violent and dramatic. However, it lacks the kind of cutting-edge story and everything else that would make this film worth owning. It's certainly not worth seeing again and again. I would suggest renting it or buying it for a buck if you can (maybe two)."
2,Man on Fire,"This could have been a good movie if you could watch it without taking a Dramamine. The hand held, jerky, flashing camera work is so distracting you can hardly watch the film. If you want a good revenge film check out The Punisher. It is way more entertaining."
4,Man on Fire,"It is a good movie, fast, lots of action and since it is made in Mexico makes it even more real. The acting is good, but it would better if we could bring back Charles Bronson to play the lead. He was good."
3,"""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""","With that line, the movie takes a drastic turn and lets it all hang out. This is a tale of two movies. One is about a bodyguard who is tasked to protect a little girl (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City. The other is a dark take of the kidnapping trade in Mexico City. This movie was much better in the second half of the film. Denzel Washington shows he can be an action hero just like Schwarzenegger and Stallone. I thought Tony Scott's direction was all glitz and glamour. We didn't see who or what the character was like and why we should care about him. All we know is what he was capable of. Overall, it's entertaining enough to recommend."
3,Mostly depressing,"This one was my husband's choice. I'm not usually much for vengeful killing movies. This one was artfully done, I suppose, but I still don't like vengeful killing movies. Dakota Fanning was the redeeming actress in this film. She was the child actress who played Pita, the little girl Denzel Washington was charged with protecting. She was amazing, and I'm sure we'll be seeing her again. Overall, the movie had some redeeming scenes, but it was depressing, and the plot wasn't so great."
4,"Moving, but tough to watch","Plot is similar to Transporter 2, but less ""Hollywood"" and much more raw. I thought the character interaction between the bodyguard and the little girl was excellent and the ending was very powerful. It's really a movie about redemption through revenge, which is definately food for thought."
4,Fairly awesome,"I'm not normally an action flick fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. The story does not drag at all, it seems everyone involved in the kidnapping is corrupt, even our hero Creasy, but it is also surprisingly touching at a couple of points. The action sequences are really well done and I like the overall dark, gritty feel. Denzel Washington gives a superb performance, as does Christopher Walken, but young Dakota Fanning absolutely shines."
3,OK......... not as good as expected,"Basically MAN ON FIRE was pretty good.Not quite what I expected from previews (pacing was a bit flat).... but much better than alot of garbage released these days.My biggest complaint ?This film had some of the worst cinematography, lighting, camera angles and editing of any film I have seen this side of low budget camcorder-shot B-films.The camera work, visuals and lighting made the film a bit annoying to watch and detracted from the film's overall impact."
3,Half and Half,"Maybe I went into this movie with too high expectations based on the cast.During the first half of the movie I found myself almost ready to turn it off. The plot was dragging and seemed monotous.Then a dramatic turn of events and the plot seems to hit the fast forward button with Denzel going nuts and seemly playing an entirely different character.Then the ending which is so unsatisfying that I wish the DVD had an alternate ending... or two...While the movie isn't great by anyone's standards, I don't think it is terrible either. In the end it is six of one and half dozen of the other...If you want an engaging plot... this sin't it. If you're trying to kill a couple hours without much thought process give this action movie a shot."
3,Denzel is always great,"I would drop a 3 1/2 star on it if i had that choice. Denzel is like an actor MVP. He makes everyone around him better. There were a couple problems i had with the movie though:1. Was this Gladiator the mexican version. I think Tony Scott ripped off his brother Ridleys soundtrack for this movie. I like the music, but it was making me laugh at the resemblance to Gladiator.2. Some parts of this movie reminded me of a commercial, like when they did the translation of words spoken in spanish. It was a little annoying.3. Spoiler alert-i was kind of hoping the girl was dead. I like sad endings, but at least Denzel bites it.4. Spoiler alert 2 -What was up with that ending where Denzel dies and they list like a real obituary and then a drug bust on the bad guy. I hate when movies, not based on a true story, use this plot device."
2,"Great movie, Poor blu-ray","I'm a big fan of this movie, and this release looks and sounds great. The special features, however, are non existent. No commentaries, no deleted scenes, no ""making of"", no special features at all. Either rent this, or wait for some kind of special edition to come out."
3,A Steven Segal movie with good actors...,"Apparently there is a patron saint of lost causes and I guess she wasn't on the set this time.This long, slow, slick, sad movie has its moments but you've seen it all before and in under 90 minutes. I'd like to say Denzel Washington's performance helps but since you already know the story, it doesn't matter much. Christopher Walken is wasted and Mickey Rourke sure looks wasted.I tought the end was missing the big payoff, too. Everybody gets what's coming to them but Denzel never gets to meet bad guy #1.There is one great line--the kind that real people never say: ""His art is killing and he's about to paint his masterpiece!"" Can you imagine, having to say that with a straight face?Its ok if you've got time to kill."
4,Denzel doing it again.,"Denzel is one of the top 5 greatest actors ever. He is the Michael Jordan of film, the Ali of his craft. We need to enjoy him now because there will never be another like him."
4,Very Good Action Movie,"I was not expecting to like this movie much but decided to give it a try anyway. Was I surprised. The action sequences are thrilling and held my attention. The plot was tight and unlike many such movies made sense. No characters doing nonsensical things. The dialogue was believable.There were a few problems. The ending was little to nice. The transformation of Denzell Washington's character was a bit too easy and unexplainable. Also, the movie was hyper-violent, even by Hollywood's current standards.Overall, a very entertaining movie and well worth the two hour investment."
