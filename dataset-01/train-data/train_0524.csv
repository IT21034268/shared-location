5,great OS book,This books picks up examples from real operating systems.. the conslusions at the end of every chapter make sense to anybody who has actually written code for an OS rather than one of those books that pontificate about how it is supposed to be.
2,a disappointment,"This book seems to be poorly constructed. Halfway through a one semester community college course, my copy is falling apart. About the content, I find it difficult to follow and suggest supplementing this text with Stallings, Operating Systems, 3rd ed."
2,gah!,"Well first off being an applications programmer this book had alot of work to do to both make the topics interesting and understandable, well Mr. Nutt failed at both. The text is dry to say the least and often vague or incoherent. For example things are explained in methods such as ""assume there 4 processes and no more are coming"" well okay there bud. And every other reviewer has said it and I'm going to say it too, the labs are horrible! The objectives are vague the suggestions given are among the most convoluted ways to approach them, and the concepts and skills neccissary and no where to be found in the book."
1,Deadlock or Deadwrong,"Mr. Nutt is a terrible author. He teaches at the University of Colorado, Boulder and it is also well known that he publishes an update every semester forcing his poor students to buy the new edition. As the other reviews pointed out, not only was this book poorly written it is poorly edited with an onslaught of errors. If you are a college teacher looking for a book to use in your Operating Systems class, DO NOT USE THIS BOOK, it is a concatenation of all the bad parts of other good books on Operating Systems."
2,If your a teacher read this !!!,This book is pretty criptic and not recommend for use in the class room. there are many other books which do a better job of covering more topics and providing better descriptions and solutions. if you are a teacher considering this book for an operating systems class please consider your students and look at something different. if you don't you will spend lots of time decifering the authors wonderful mathmatical formulations of the topics he does cover
1,Worst CS Book I have ever purchased and had the displeasure of reading,"I bought this book because it was required for my Operating Systems class and boy is this book terrible. All the technology discussed in this book is outdated by about 10 years (in this book DVDs have just become mainstream, that's how old it is) and the concepts are not explained very well at all. If you are a professor, please find a better book for your CS students."
3,Mediocre as a text book.,The book has many typos both in the explanations and the code examples. Some of the chapter review questions cannot be answered from within the text as the author does not always discuss the subject.Works okay as an introduction into Operating Systems but the information is quite out of date these days. Could use a new revision.
5,Superb!,"Much like Arundhati Roy (in ""God of Small Things"") and Sandra Cisneros (in ""House on Mango Street""), Ama Ata Aidoo often uses the experiences, expectations, and disappointments of children to paint the portrait of a culture and a community. It's not a novel literary device, but in the hands of the right craftswoman, one that can be used to great affect and Aidoo doesn't disappoint. The book includes eleven short stories and a fine, if superfluous, afterword by Ketu Katrak."
2,Sure to disappoint and delight,"My 7 year old daughter bought this set with her birthday money. She was looking forward to learning about the novelty of a ""film camera"" and being a junior photographer. The poor quality camera let in so much light that the entire roll was exposed while in the camera. Unfortunately I didn't know this until after a special trip to the drugstore to get the film developed. She was very disappointed by the resulting strip of black plastic that was supposed to be cherished photos of her favorite things.I'd find a cheaper alternative product that doesn't include a cheap camera. This is definitely one of those times where you get what you pay for."
2,"Not clever, just tedious","Dip into this book anywhere. Skip ten pages or 110. Read the whole thing or just read the first installment over and over and over again. It won't make the slightest bit of difference. For all it's supposedly clever feints, I found this book a grinding test of patience. Once you read the frist chapter, you've about got it. Characters, plot, and style are all thin to the point of banal, and the whole somehow manages to be even less than the sum of these thin ingredients. Among the other chores the reader must accomplish to reach the finish is to join in the narrator's conceit that his excessivly adolescent notes for a book would somehow interest a publisher, much less a reader."
4,Fun,I enjoyed this movie. It was simple but entertaing. If you looking for something that is fun and does not require you to think then I recommend this movie.
2,Scardey Cat Director/Producers,"as a fan of the original, i couldn't wait to see this movie but they just didn't go far enough in anything. it really was like they were just afraid to go for it. i think the major fault lies within the script, characters making stupid decisions and subplots going nowhere."
2,Bloody Mother's Day,"This movie was a serious disappoint. I guess I had my expectations set too high thinking Rebecca D. would be good like she was in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"". She was just as creepy if not more. However, it was a brutal movie to get through with the senseless killings, blood and gore. To me, it was cheap and downright disturbing."
2,Overtones of throw mama from train,"To me it resembles through mama from train?Dont know if it was Rebecca Demonsry hair do or the plot? Love Rebecca in what ever she does shes a great actress.Just seems the plot could of been a little deeper,more twists and turns and more to the imagination."
2,"The two stars are for the acting, a better script would have made it three stars or better","I agree with the the reviewer that gave this movie one star. I should have looked at that review before my purchase. I gave the movie two stars, the extra star was just for the the actors. The actors were good and deserved a much better script. This script made NO SENSE , not one. Its almost like they gave up and left sooooo many holes in the script , the ending was UNBELIEVABLE even for a movie"
4,very good,"De Mornay does an awesome job as Mama!! Almost gave it a 5, but I had a few qualms with how things ended. I agree with what most people had to say- that there were twists. I just didn't like a couple of them. Definitely horror, which is a plus considering the stuff out there now posing as horror. Had a touch of a psychological thriller too. Fascinating to watch the hold mama has on her boys and girl. One scary mama!"
4,Mothers Day,This a typical Rebecca Demornay movie and does NOT have a typical ending- Nice to see. Very Good!Kept me on the edge of my seat-
1,Do not watch this movie,"This is a home invasion movie with extremely bad acting, poor plot development, too long, amateurish. I stopped watching after 45 minutes. Skip it. If you must watch a home invasion horror flick watch something like the 1997 version of ""Funny Games"", 2008 film ""Inside"" or ""The Perfect Host""."
3,The Sequel?,"I have to give this a 3 because:Cons:1.) I hate movies that are set up for a sequel.2.) Some play given to secrets between lovers and friends and the psychological damage - but not enough to be considered a psychological thriller, and its hard to keep that in mind with the constant action.3.) Drifts into dark comedy then slams you back into gore.4.) I was not at all surprised by the ending - very Jasonesque.Pros:1.) Rebecca DeMorney is great - loved the typical 'Mom' lines with the sadistic twist.2.) Jaime King was also very good.3.) Innovative use of hand tools.4.) The black guy didn't die first.So, maybe a 2.5 would have been more accurate. It's certainly action packed, though I didn't anything particularly startling with so-called plot twists. If you like gore, the gore is quite well done even with the usual dim or back lighting.It did leave me with a lingering question - Who in their right mind has that much saran wrap on hand?"
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD...DE MORNAY DEMENTED ROLE","Not worth even .99 rental - skip it - atrocious movie. I read all of the wonderful reviews and rented this movie and I want to save everyone time and money and tell them to SKIP this movie and save their money. The plot is horrible (not sure if there even IS one) and the end is not fulfilling nor does it make any sense. Every once in a while I feel the pressing need to add my opinion and this time is one of them. Rebecca De Mornay should have waited for a much better vehicle to try to make her entrance back into film. Oh, and one more thing? She looks just like Hillary Clinton and that creates an odd impression also of our secretary of state slashing and killing all the way through a movie. (Maybe that is an omen about the next presidential election?) Last thing? Brett Ratner, if this is the best you could do then no wonder you were fired from presenting the Oscars sorry to say. Do some quality work again, please?"
1,Don't buy this helmet!,"My son wanted this helmet so badly that I bought it for him without reading any reviews. I now noticed that someone else wrote a review about the helmet cracking. Well, our helmet has at least 6 cracks in it, mostly along the back and is about to fall apart. It is a beautiful helmet when it comes out of the box, but it is not durable at all and my son is completely sad and disappointed that he can no longer wear it! DON'T BUY IT! There are some serious flaws with the manufacturing! If I could fix/glue it I would but I don't know what type of material to use to repair it. What a total waste of money!"
2,Not what it seems!,"I loved Frank Miller's 300 movie, and wanted to get costume props, yet they only had overly priced adult armor. The helmet was on sale else ware, so I got it cheaper, but it is nothing like on the box. Instead of a properly shaped brass/gold color it looks like oxidized bronze, not to mention the cheek pieces stick out, unlike the picture. For the thirty dollars I paid I would say it was not worth it. It fell head-first on the floor once, and developed a large crack in the skull area, proving little durability."
4,Moanin in the Moonlight,Great book- this will rock your world and more people need to know of the Wolf's power in and on music .
3,Excelent overview of Howlin' Wolf and his time,"The book not only explains the biography of Chester Burnett, aka Howlin' Wolf, but it also expands to the way of life in the Mississippi Delta area during the hard times of the early XX century. Through the pages of this book parade characters like Charlie Patton, Son House, etc., and not only blues musicians, but also relevant personalities of the time and place, like politicians, record company owners, etc. A must have for any blues lover, and an interesting book for those interested in the hard history of what is now called afro-american community. - Un estupendo libro sobre Howlin' Wolf y el blues y la vida dura en el Delta a principios del siglo XX. Chean Martinez, Spain."
4,Good stuff,This was Wolf's last album and shows that he was still a Master. Hubert Sumlin's guitar is better than ever and there are two or three songs as good as anything Wolf has ever done. A worthy addition.
1,Rip-off,"The cd is taken from an overseas lp master tape and is not mixed for cd. If you want the best sound quality, purchase the America version (MCA - 088 112 043-2) lovingly remastered by Stephen Barncard."
3,"Decent, but some unreleased versions","I was rather dissapointed/annoyed that the version of ""Dark Star"" is not the one that was released on CSN. This CD contains a rather funky version recorded at a concert in Portland. The second CD is primarily unreleased versions also, although most are fairly decent. Had I this purchase to do over, I would have just purchased a few of their albums, not this compilation."
5,Don your dyes and sandals!!!!,"Years ago, a friend of mine taped a CSN compilation album called ""Replay"" for me. Having migrated to CDs, I was unable to obtain a CD version of ""Replay"", but I did find this compilation which has all the same songs and more!!!The live version of ""Dark Star"" blew me away--I listen to it over and over again!!!!I consider it one of the greatest crimes that I was born too late to hear this music in its heyday ('course I'd probably be dead of a drug overdose or at least have killed the majority of my brain cells). But I do remember them recording ""Southern Cross"" in the 80s, which was a favorite of mine back then and it's on this CD.And let's not forget the melodic, yet in-your-face lyrics of ""Wind on the Water.""This is all the CSN you'll need!!!!"
4,Be careful!!,"A great reminder of a powerful sound...But, as other reviews have mentioned, the alternate takes can be decieving! Who added the extra drums to Suite Judy Blue Eyes? Why they alt take? The WRONG version of Helplessly Hoping?But so much is RIGHT here....it reminds me of why I bought an acoustic guitar so long ago. An amazing sound...an amazing time..."
4,"A Great Compilation, But One Song Noticably Absent","I too, much like a previous reviewer, bought this for the original version of ""Chicago/We Can Change the World."" I have to say that I was extremely pleased and satisfied with the copious song selection, but upon further review of the track listing, I realized one glaring omission: ""Deja Vu."" I was honestly surprised that nobody else noted this in any of the reviews that I read, but I think it's worth noting that the very track that starts their 1974 primer compilation, ""So Far,"" not being included in this set is a little displeasing. But no matter, for I am content to have the group's 1970 seminal release by the same name which features said track; one of their most complex and intricate arrangements, and a song that for many defined CSNY's signature harmonious stylings. Still, an otherwise great anthology by a timeless quartet. Glad to hear--and see--them still rocking in all their glory even now in 2006!"
2,Missing something?,"I really don't understand everyone's enthusiam over this book. Perhaps it's because I read it in ""isolation"" and didn't even realize Diaz is the critics darling. In my opinion it's decent, but it's far from one of the most interesting books I've ever read. It's difficult to understand--it reads like a novel, but it's really a collection of short stories. The reoccuring characters get confusing, and one cannot discern who was in which story and when. The stories for me just lack that certain *umph*. I've read many other, better, books about the American-dream-gone-awry experience. Try _Native Speaker_ or _White Boy Shuffle_ to see what it really means to be an outsider living in the U.S. Or _The House on Mango Street_ for a Mexican girl's perspective."
5,"crisp, spare, yet loaded - one of the best writers of this generation","Diaz is certainly spare with words -- each page is typeset with largish print font, widely spaced -- yet each story is loaded with history, economics, poetry, and meaning. This is a writer who has mastered the short story. None of the stories have that ""failed novel"" feel. I read the stories three years ago, and the images still haunt my mind. I cannot say this about most things I read. Diaz bridges the urbane, the urban, with the suburban and shows the spectrum, the interrelatedness, the relativity of people to one another."
4,pretty good indeed,I thought that it was a pretty good. Although very graphic in some parts it does a very good job of portraying a poor family adapting to a new culture and all fo the hardships they go through. At the beginning of the book there are Spanish words being used all over the place which makes it difficult understand. As the book goes on they get fewer and far between. in the beginning of the book though it is frustrating because you are not sure what she means. I loved the book because it didnt hold anything back...The author wasnt afraid to use strong language and grave details. It was sad that the boy was waiting for the rest of his family to make it to america...it must have been tough never knowing if he would see them again. Although the compilation of 10 stories was good it was hard to follow the stories at times when they went back and forth in time. all in all it was an all around great read.
3,Good read but not all that it's cut out to be.,"I purchased this book after reading a print out of, fiesta, from my English class. I thought my husband and myself could relate to Diaz, since we come from similar backgrounds but after reading the book, I changed my mind. To many doors left open for me. Like what happened to his little sister? He mentioned living with ""the girlfriend"" but where did his mom go, since she was living in the apartment?I guess I wasn't expecting a weird twisted, chicken soup, life is tough, kinda book. But it still kept my attention on finishing it."
4,Hitting Home - For Many,"This book is very deep, yet very understandable and easy to follow. Growing up as a Hispanic in New York seems common enough. However, this book singles out many of the issues that are faced by any minority group and attacks them with the plain truth. In his slang simplicity, Junot Diaz gives somewhat of an identity to thousands of people who can directly relate to the triumphs and pitfalls of the main character. I hope to see more by Junot Diaz soon."
5,"DON'T WAIT, GET IT NOW!!!!","I had heard a lot about Juno Diaz's collection of stories and I lingered before actually ordering it. I am so glad that I finally ordered it. Drown is intense, smart, tight, well-written, well-ordered, and compelling. I couldn't put the book down. The stories and the emotion behind them are not stale or trite. Not to mention the language is not only representative of two cultures but of two worlds sometimes at odds, sometimes coexisting. This book doesn't hold back, it isn't safe, but yet it isn't forced or phony. More than anything, it was fun and it made me think, remember, learn. Fabulous!!"
5,One of the Top Four Books of the 1990's!,"I would say that ""Drown"" is the best short story collection I have ever read. I would say ""Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings"" is the best anthology I have ever read. I would say that ""When I Was Puerto Rican"" was the best memoir I ever read. And I would say ""Song of Simple Truth: The Collected Poems of Julia De Burgos"" edited by Jack Agueros is the best poetry collection I have ever read. Thanks for this amazing art!"
5,The Hip Hop Flare of Junot Diaz,"Whether or not anyone else has been described as thus, Junot Diaz holds the title of ""King Of Hip Hop Flavored Literature."" In his first, eagerly awaited collection of short fiction, Diaz' voice explodes onto the American literary scene.Just like Hip Hop, Diaz weaves a darkly construed realism into each of his ten tales, many of which are loosely based on his experiences as a young Dominican immigrant in the New York area. More raging-into-manhood than coming-of-age, the stories in ""Drown"" each reflect different aspects of a young life: from hard-edged, yet tender humor (""Fiesta, 1980"" and ""How To Date A Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl Or A Halfie""), the heartbreaking (""Ysrael"") to the bittersweet (""Negocios"") and angst-riddedn anxiety (""Drown"").Diaz' prose does not contain one false note and his work will be greatly appreciated for years to come."
2,"good, but not great","I've heard such good things about this book and was disappointed once I got around to reading it. It was good, but not great. I get the sense that this is one of those over-hyped, over-rated books that come down the pipe every year by the latest ""new, young writer."" I'll look forward to reading what Diaz writes in the years ahead. For my taste, he hasn't hit the mark yet -- but maybe in the future he will. Worth a look, but no big deal."
4,Great Debut,"For a first published work this is a wonderful collection of short fiction. It sometimes feels as though multiculturism is a literary fad as there are so many popular books released with collections of American fiction from the new arrival perspective. Much of it is good, Diaz is very good. These stories describing youthful experiences in both the Dominican Republic and urban New Jersey resonate with atmosphere and character.They are not uniformly of the best quality. There are times when the stories feel less than fully developed but overall Diaz displays a great feel for setting and writes about people that draws the reader into their world , just possibly wishing there was more.Look forward to reading his novel."
5,"Provocative, Compelling & Heartbreaking","Only the second Dominican writer to be published in English in the US, Junot Diaz writes with such an authentic voice, such a clear cadence and rhythm, that your response to these perfect short storeis is a visceral as the writing itself. Often on the top of many people's favorite collections, these stories are exquisitely rough gems, bulletins from the abyss that simultaneously make you laugh out loud and wish you could hang with these sweet tigres. A must for anyone interested in learning how to develop voice, also essential for adolescents interested in global perspectives right in their own backyards."
5,A rare treasure,"I first read Drown about a year ago when I found it amongst my brother's things. Since then, I've re-read it again and again and again...Diaz has an amazing talent for writing emotional narratives incredibly stark and understated, yet very capable of moving the reader the brink of tears.In this collection of short stories, he moves back and forth from the Dominican Republic to the Eastern Seaboard of the US, documenting and dramatizing lives and stories from the old country and the new. Most of the stories are written in the first person, yet it's never really apparent if the narrator remains the same person. It's almost heartbreaking to believe that is the case, with the way the ""American Dream"" dictates the immigrant experience captured within.Unfortunately, books so moving don't materialize every day. It's not that it's groundbreaking or unbelievable, just beautifully written. Mr. Diaz, we're waiting for your follow-up."
5,Beautiful,"This is simply beautiful writing. Stories about real characters, writing that takes you deep into their crazy lives until you feel as though you knew them. Also quite funny."
2,Well written but not engaging to me,"Although I greatly enjoyedThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, I was never able to get excited about Drown. It may be due to the fact that the main characters were so unsympathetic - in several instances their actions made we want to shout at them in anger and frustration. The book is well written, but somehow failed to draw me in as a reader."
2,Whats the big deal?,"I read this entire book and could not see what the critics were raving about. Diaz is a decent writer, but by no means excellent. Many of his stories stop instead of ending. The story ""drown"" is particularly disappointing. I also noticed that he only uses spanish to say vulgar words. This seemed to me that he was just throwing spanish in to seem more cultural, and that the words were not a natural result of him being bilingual.He does get some things right, though. He has the beginnings of interesting characters and situations, but they are never fully developed, and seem to be lost in the larger waste. I do not agree ... that Diaz characters were all stereotypes. I found his characters to be diverse, distinct characters, and therefore reject the idea that his characters were cookie-cut outs.In the end, though, I would say this book is not worth reading, ... you would be much better off reading ""The House on Mango Street"" by Sandra Cisneros."
5,amazing first collection,"this is an incredible first collection; this guy's got an incredibly powerful and unique voice. judging by his most recent stories (""nilda,"" from the new yorker, and ""the sun, the moon, and the stars,"" from best american short stories 1999), he is getting even better. definitely one of the best young writers today."
4,Impressed,I must be honest I did not know who Junot Diaz was or any of his work. I was scrolling and found This is how you lose her. I was instantly hooked. I then decided to learn more about Yunior and purchased Drown. I am inspired by his work is all I can say. Culturally and socially inspired with a hint of melancholy. Deep sigh Que pura dulzura amarga
3,running theme,I suppose this is the beginning for his other books which I happened to read first. By far the last story is the best and sets the stage for this is how you lose her. Some of the other stories don't seem to go anywhere. Good writer though.
5,Tough and Vulnerable Voices,"There is absolutely no disputing the fact that Junot Diaz is an insanely talented writer. Writing short stories is not an easy task, yet Diaz does it effortlessly.5 Star Worthy- The characters are tough- they've seen everything and are fazed by little. Yet at the same time they are vulnerable and humane.- Diaz represents loss in each story, although each situation and experience is unique.- The Boy Without a Face adds an interesting perspective to the collection, serving as a foil to other narrators.- A certain level of ambiguity in the narration makes the reader realize that the characters' voices represent the many boys in the barrios.Nit Picky- I wanted to know more about the characters and their stories! Diaz obviously did his job, handing the reader tasty morsels, making them crave more!I can't waste to see what else Junot Diaz brings us in the years to come."
5,great book,"I had to buy this book for a class, but i actually enjoyed it. It was weird reading it because i felt like i already knew the story. The entire book is a Dominican family trying to live life in America. Thats a horrible summery lol, but the reason i say i feel like i know this story is because my family and me, were Dominicans and we went though a lot of the same crap. But this story can sound familiar to any immigrant family, Dominican or not, Latino or European, or any where else."
2,a Bukowski rip-off,I read Drown and liked it. And then I read Bukowski's Ham on Rye. Man... Diaz is a thief.
1,"Nice guy, poor collection","In this collection of ten stories, the narrator is a young Dominican Republic boy who grows up with his father in America and is waiting for him to send for the rest of the family. The stories explore everything from his parents' marriage falling apart to interracial dating. However, I disliked the style of stories going back and forth in time, it was confusing, and sometimes it took it a while to tell if we were in America or the Dominican Republic still, or how old the narrator was, I liked how the author used Spanish words thrown in to the story; it helped it sound more realistic. However, his spare style bugged me. I got to meet the author, and he read us a story from another collection, which I liked a lot better."
5,WANTS TO BE A NOVEL,"The stories in this book are incredible. I re-read many of them for the sheer joy of being surprised, delighted, and angered again. Mr. Diaz is an artist with an unmatched eye for the telling detail, the telling moment. I felt, too, that the arrangement of the stories delineated a pattern that may or may not have been intended. In other words, with a few name changes (and the elimination of perhaps two stories), this collection of stories could have been a novel. I enjoyed it, nevertheless, and look forward to more of his work."
5,Drowning in Diaz's Gritty Brilliance,"I realize much has been said about ""Drown"" by Junot Diaz. Suffice it to say that these ten stories come at you with a brilliant, gritty, urban language that takes you by your neck and tells you, Listen to me, this is my reality; you don't have to like it, but listen. And listen we must. The tightness of his sentences reminds me of Raymond Carver's style, but Diaz has created something new, not derivative. For lovers of the short story, ""Drown"" must be on your list. Breathtaking!"
5,"Raw, honest, and fantastic","I had read Diaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao prior to even learning about this book, and the novel only whetted my appetite for the writing style that is so deftly employed in this collection of short stories. Though I can't say I even remotely understand where these characters are coming from in a message of plight and struggle, the emotions portrayed in each of the stories is easy to understand and empathize with. My two favorite stories were ""Aurora"" and ""Boyfriend,"" both of which deal with dysfunctional relationships and address the struggles that one can have moving on from the past. Each story flowed extremely well and I loved seeing the connections that each had from one another, despite the time and locational differences that existed from tale to tale."
5,Great pad! Better & cheaper than stock,"I installed these on my 2005 M3. After the initial break in (a little more than 700 miles until they stopped squeaking) they are working wonderfully. There is far far less dust than the stock pad as well. Your rims will thank you.Keep in mind that you should not turn BMW rotors, and if there is any lip at all on the rotor it will take a little longer to break them in. If the rotors are under spec you should definitely replace them. This makes for a longer lasting brake anyway."
4,REAL PRACTICLE BOOK,"MARRIAGE TAKES MORE THAN LOVE CAME QUICKLY & IN GOOD SHAPE. THE BOOK WAS NOT THE LATEST VERSION BUT STILL A GREAT BOOK ON MARRIAGE.IN HIM, DR. CARL"
3,"Right Idea, Rough Approach","This book presents a lot of good (and great) advice for couples. However, the usage of Bible verses and ""God this, God that"" can easily be off-putting. A more appropriate title would be ""God in Marriage"" or something similar. If you're a very religious Christian in need of ""refreshing"" marriage advice, this is the book for you. Otherwise, skip on by."
3,No opinion,"I cannot really critique this book because I never could get the actual game to install on my pc. Thus, I never read this book with any real determination."
5,Chilis at their best.,I dont know what K. P. was listening to but I believe this is the most amazing and origional cd in the chilis collection. Mr Clinton really got the guys funkin. If you think you are a chilis fan and dont have this then you have only scratched the surface and shouldnt even contemplate yourself being a fan.Go out and get it.I give this 10 stars. peace out J
2,eh,"It doesn't have a good consistency to it, most songs are too loud and boring and there are maybe 3 songs I can truly say I like. It would be better to get What Hits instead or another best-of album.For serious Pepper fans it might be nice to have because of nostalgia and the pics of Hillel Slovak with the band, before he passed away. But I don't find myself listening to it much."
1,WHAT A SH*T,"I bought this cd after listening the super album unfmofo party plan. But this record has nothing to do with that one, it is SO uncreative, has no good song . trust me, dont listen to this record."
2,Worst of the Red Hot CDs,"Although there are some enjoyable moments here, the CD is just far too simplistic in comparison to later RHCP albums. After a few listens, there isn't really anthing special to keep you coming back for more - especially with the weak lyrics. Buy all later Red Hot CDs, especially ""Mother's Milk"", ""Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"" and ""Californication"" and you'll be very happy!"
1,Another early work from RHCP that is missable,'Freaky Styley' is a apt name for this album release by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The early songs from this band continues to allude my tastes. I earn for the rock and slight rap of the later albums like By The Way and What Hits.Another CD that wont be played at home.
3,Pretty spicey,"3 1/2Like their early funk-punk approach or not, this mid-80's sophomore release still packs a punch. It is one of those rare, wisely put together party rock discs made in that decade that actually grows better with age, providing ample subtly amongst all the upbeat frenzy. These songs appeared so uniquely brash when debuting, it was easy to dismiss some, though in retrospect FS remains as hot a dish the Pepper's ever served."
3,"Half really great, Half okay","I think the fact that The Red Hot chilli Peppers, got George Clinton, to lay down some funk is geat . George, helped produce this cd.The first six songs are awesome. My favorites are 'Jungleman','Hollywood (Africa)'. Also the remake of Sly And The Family Stones, 'If you want me to stay', is also great.However the other songs like 'Sex Rap', are just okay. I would only get this, if you are a true Chilli Peppers, fan."
5,"Thank you, Michelle","Like the cicadas, I hibernated from radio music and miss groups that come along; but, Michelle gave me Red Hot Chili Peppers CD that had me wanting more and Freaky Styley follows suit."
5,hillel BLAZES!!,"the RHCP theme song along ('nevermind') makes this a classic! and with so many quality tracks, you can't go wrong!"
1,Not what it says,The product is listed as being pre-tapped. Trueth is they no longer pre-tap the item. When it came to me it was the same as the blank housing. When I called about returning it they stated that I would either have to return the item or buy the self tapping bolts. The bolts are 1.50 each and shipping is 8 dollars. To return the item is another 9 dollars so either way you lose more money in shipping then what you pay for the item. Total garbage and false advertising.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"You would think that this would be a prety good book, since it was written by a beautiful woman. WRONG again! It is filled with way too much common sense. I think that nearly all men know to dress in clean clothes and have a clean home and car. She doesn't go into detail on what women like in men, how to ask for that date and how to be more interesting to her while on that date. You would think she would have this, but she doesn't. This book was a big let down for me. She went on too much on how couples interact with one another. Something a single guy doesn't need to know. She is a heck of a looker, but not much for giving good advice. I agree with the May 14 review. He hit the nail on the head about this book."
5,Common Sense,"What is so good about this book is that it slaps you in the face and shows you common sense advice. I honestly did not know it was this simple.I have put into practice and yes I have been rejected, but on the whole I have now been on more dates in the last six months than I have in 2 years.The book is a great buy."
3,A 6 for a book on 10's,"Having read several other books on dating secrets this one didn't have a whole lot more to offer over the others. It was interesting to read the attitudes of exceptionally attractive women ""between the lines"". Some of the information was misleading (as will be found in most books written by women for men); be sure to compare her advice with the advice of other authors before practicing it yourself. Secret/chapter #9 was particularly interesting as the predigested findings of 2 male researchers from the 1980's. Generally well written and organized by an intelligent (as well as beautiful - if that's her picture on the back) author who did her homework."
1,Paperback Hero,"This is not what the review says it is. I have ordered it twice thinking I was getting the Australian version, only to get a 1987 US movie.. I am not happy with the product."
2,Too big for small hands,"They looked OK for a low-priced pair of Vinyl Gloves. However, these should come in two sizes (S-M & L-XL), as they are too big (way too) for small hands like mine. I ended up not using it as I thouhgt I looked like wearing men's gloves (not even for a costume which is what I bought these for).So, in sum, if your hands are somewhat big, you can go ahead and get these, but for smaller hands they definitely don't look good."
2,Gloves,"I have a thing for gloves. All kinds, especially leather ones. But, ordered these. They really aren't as ""wet"" look as I thought they would be. They actually DO appear to look like more of a satin glove. But, for the price, I just kept them."
4,Sexy not sticky,"Very nicely tailored, better quality than I expected, super sexy. I have medium sized hands. The only downside: they do not stick to poles. Sadly, I can't climb or flip with these on."
4,Pretty great.,"They look amazing, they feel comfortable, but one cut or rip and it's all over. I bought these for a costume, cut off the fingeres, and the sewing didn't stay together so the finger seams completely fell apart. They aren't as long as the picture but they're still pretty sweet."
3,Big shapeless shiny gloves,"These arrived quickly, but were very large, like they were for a man's hands. The wrists and arms had a good 2 inches extra material in them. I had to sew them smaller, and they still looked silly."
5,Love it,"It is an excellent series. Each book in the series is unique but linked together. Love, Love, love, it. Susan Cooper did a great job again."
3,The Grey King,Susan Cooper did a wonderful job on The Grey King. It was very mysterious. It was about a boy named Will and a boy named Bran who need to stop an evil magical king and his followers. Or else the world will be in peril. They are the only ones who can stop him!
3,Pretty good,"This forth installment in ""The Dark is Rising Series"" seems to combine elements from the previous four. The ""Hardy Boys"" feel of the first book unfortunately returns, and while not full blown is enough to pull the book down somewhat.On the up side though some of the mystique of the second book that emulates ""Dark Shadows"" is there, standing side by side with the third books more complex immagery. So in the end were this book made into a movie, while it would have been doable in the 60s, lacking anything that would have looked too cheasy, it would also be possible to be done in the 20th century without adding in two hours of mindless action that didn't occurr in the book, just to make the f/x guys happy (do the cave, the Grey King, and a time travel scene for Gwene and Bran, then send them on to the next movie with a smile and a months paycheck for two weeks)."
2,A boring book,"I read this book and found it to be extremely boring. It was a little complicated and sometimes it just did not make any sense. I enjoy fantasy, and this book wasn't REALLY like a fantasy book. There wasn't enough action and too much talking about something that really did not matter."
3,hmmmmm......,"This is a good book, but if you like fantasy, you would enjoy Tolkien better. I've not read any other Dark is Rising books so I have no comment on them. Susan C. had the right idea but a true fantasy is with elves, dwarves, dragons, demons, necromancers, worlocs, witches, wizards, ect. which is in Tolkien books more than The Dark is Rising sequence.At least based on The Grey King."
2,Read it in class..BORING!!,some of the chapters were good but most of them were just so boring! I mean its not like a book where you wanted to keep on reading and never put down. if you want a good read read a george orwell or orson scott card book not this one.
3,Another struggle between Dark and Light,"The boy Will recovering from a nearly fatal hepatitisis sent to his aunt's in Wales to recover, but alsoon a mission to retrieve the golden harp and awake the six sleepers.In his way is Brenin LLwyd, the Grey King, who is one of theancient dark powers. His unlikely new friend turns out tobe a son of power out of time.What I liked about this book is the explanation pronunciation of Welshnames. Where many place Arthur in the midlands or lakes area,it seem that Susan Cooper is for the hills of Wales.This book is the third of these serial tales that I have read,and I thinkGreenwitch (The Dark Is Rising Sequence)may be slightly better in characterization and plot.Others have done this kind of writing better that I have read.The Owl Serviceis a good example."
4,Very good book!,"I thought this book was very interesting, and i liked all of the history behind it. If you like Susan Cooper's books this is a ""must read""."
4,Awsome book!,"In this book it gives detail,action and mystery. The Grey King is a legend about two boys named Will and Bran who are on a quest to find a golden harp and destroy all evil.If you like action you'll like this book!"
4,Great book!,"Lovely appliqué. I don't use their Piece 'O Cake style of appliqué (I use back basting), but I truly love the patterns."
1,UTTERLY PATHETIC...,"I almost died when I heard this album. As a huge fan of the first 2 Mercyless albums, ""Abject Offerings"" and ""Coloured Funeral"", I was not expecting them to change directions musically. What Max Otero has done here is pretty much what that other dumbbell named Max has done. What the heck is it with frontmen named Max?? Why do they start out awesome and then go lame? This CD is a complete failure. No technical riffs, no intense drumming no song writing no arpeggios nothing! Mercyless have become just another B.S. Ozzfest, Korn, Slipknot mallcore band. Such a disappointment! If you have listened to ""Abject offerings"" then you know what I am talking about. Its a shame to see such a great band regress into complete talentless musical crud. Mercyless need to wake up and quit wasting their time and talent creating garbage alternative poser metal and return to their Technical Death roots."
5,Awesome little sleeper,"I loved this movie. It was different, very well acted & directed, and I must admit had some nice shirtless scenes to boot."
3,Caravan,"A teen girl shared a boyfriend with another girl-a friend of her living with a father in a caravan park Dreamland, and, it seems, this dad is on her plate too.Not much drama as long as a young lover is good enough for both young females."
5,Great Ride!,"It's in great condition, was shipped very promptly. I truly appreciate that. Great doing business."
5,Pre punk pleasure,"This is a marvelous collection of Kink's Klassiks, and a couple of tunes by Ray solo. All the hits are accounted for and if you're not familiar with everything, it should wet your appetite to explore further.During the Brittish invasion, the Kinks were like the Who in their revilre of American Rock n' Roll. 'All day, and all of the night' was one of the hardest things out there in '64. Then they diversified following 'Who'll be the next in line"" with 'Dedicated follower of Fashion' 'Sunny Afternoon' Victoria' 'Waterloo Sumset'. Right up into the 70's with 'Celluloid Heros' and their hits from the 80's on Arista, they have never been pigeon holed. If you can find Muswell Hillbillies, you'll see that they are not content to stand still. 45 years and counting. You'll enjoy this set."
5,All You Need,"This collection replaces everything I had of the Kinks and then adds new gems. All this with quality sound. Well worth the money, and I played it five times in the first ten days which is rare for me."
2,slightly exasperating,"What is with these people? For me, the emotional responses of nearly everybody in this book were strange, at best. Ten years after a supposed stillbirth and a failed romance, a woman returns to her hometown to find that her daughter is alive and well, hidden away because of the schemes of our hero's conniving snobbish relatives. But does our heroine attempt to confront said snobbish relatives? No. Does she attempt to honestly clear the air with our hero? Not worth a hoot. It even takes a while before she seems to have strong feelings for her daughter. And our hero comes off as rather a judgmental jerk himself. This only gets two stars because the father daughter interaction is handled well."
4,TANTALISING,"This is a classic for lovers of dark genre. A fan since the first hot blood release, Deadly after dark carries the trademark of cleverly combining erotica and horror into a collection of short stories. Very readable and recommended."
4,Every dog has their day,"I really enjoyed this book just like I did the first! Jaylin never cease to amaze me and the women in his life seem more desperate than ever.I really believe Jaylin needs to be brought down a notch because his ego is way out of control,and to me that makes him very unattractive,so I dont see what the big fuss over him is about.Anyway,I have 4 more books to go with this series,and judging by the way Naughty 2 ended things are about to get real interesting!"
5,Back again,"So Nokea walks away from both Jaylin and Stephen. Well, it's not exactly a bad thing. However, who didn't know she'd let him hit whenenver and apparently where ever he wanted? lol Clearly she hadnt learned a thing.Jaylin acting like Nokea broke his wittle heart, and vowed he would get wild and crush hearts. Well , I saw no difference between his action in this book and the first. even down to the fact that he kept putting his hands on his women in a violent manner.His and Scorpio's back and forth will make your head spin.This book is another fun exciting read. If you liked the first one this won't dissapoint you."
5,Simply irresistable!!!,"Jaylin's back and he's badder! The sequel unlike so many has lived up and even gone beyond the first one. Ms. Hampton, you've done it again.....CONGRATS!!! I could not put this book down, it was so good that I didn't want to go anywhere or do anything until I finished reading it. All I can say is Thank you Ms. Hampton for creating such a wonderful work of fiction that is filled with a harsh slap of reality!"
4,D-R-A-M-A!!!!!!!!,"Jaylin Jerome Rodgers has no respect for women. He treats them as puppets pulling their strings whenever and however he wants and they take it. But he does have a soft spot for his children but his arrogance and bossiness is causing one of them to be just like him.This is my first time reading Ms. Hampton's books. I read it out of sequence but I was still able to figure out what happened in the first book. Sex, drama-filled, sex and more sex. And there's even a family secret thrown in the mix.The story is also thought provoking....how much can a person take before too much is too much?Good job Ms. Hampton!!!"
5,***HOT***HOT***HOT***,"Wow! This book was HOT! I never heard of Brenda Hampton before I read this book...a book that I picked up by accident not knowing what it was all about. I could not put this book down until the end, I actually read it in 4 hours. Now that I know who Brenda Hampton is, I intend to read everything she has written...and I'm starting with the first in the Jaylin series. That man is seriously a man I love to hate. I would love to try him on for size but wouldn't want to be in a relationship with him, if you know what I mean. <wink-wink>"
4,Excellent Book! I would recommend this book to anyone!,"This book was excellent, i have only read it twice but if i could check it out again i would. This book was definately one of the BEST I have ever read. I liked this book because it ranges from exciting, to terror, and then back to happiness. When i was first assigned this book i thought it looked like the stupidest thing i had ever seen. I also thought that Bonnie was a little self-centered snob that was spoiled rotten. As i continued to read i realized that she cared about her cousin and truly cared for the other orphans. I'm one of those people who likes a little bit of blood and gore, throughout the entire book i was waiting for someone to get eaten by a wolf. If someone would have i would have given it 5 stars instead of 4. Overall this was a good book and I look forward to reading other of Joan Aiken's books!"
4,Loved it when I was younger - would I now?,"I really loved this book when I was younger, and would be interested to read it again to see if it gives me the same pleasure (a lot of books I used to love don't). I remember liking the contrast between Bonnie and Sylvia - one feisty and impetuous, the other sweet and meek - it makes me think now of the contrast between Jane andElizabeth Bennet, or Bella Wilfer and Lizzie Hexam. Of course I always identified with the feisty one, but you need the sweet mild one for balance. I also loved hearing about their escape from Miss Slighcarp and the awful orphanage-type place where they had to stay. It's true the book is sometimes quite scary and disturbing, but then so is a lot of Roald Dahl and some of the ""Mary Poppins"" books - I don't think children should be scared too much, but a little adds spice to a story."
3,What I think about the The wolves of willoughby Chase,"I think the book is ok so far,I havent gotton really far in it yet.But its a good book and I hope they can git away from the wolves,but my favorit part sdo far has been where Sylvia, and the others were in a cart trying to run from the wolves and the men were shooting muskets at them.But all and all its a really good book."
3,My thot on wolves of Willoughby chase,"I thought the book was ok,its not the best I have ever read.I really like the part were they were in the cart and trying to get away from the wovles,shooting muskets at them.I think the wolves should have got them thow. My other favorit part is where the skeliton was hanging on the door.The book had its down's to it was kinda boring thow,I fell asleep on it to but some parts were ok. But other parts were boring,like when they just sit there and talk and dont do anything the hole chapter"
5,Worth reading over and over,"I was first given this book as a gift when I was 11 or 12, and read it over and over for years. It's gone missing within the past 25 years or so, but I never forgot it. It always totally absorbed my interest and started me on a lifelong love of everything English. Now that I know I can get my hands on it again, I'll buy a new copy to read over and over during the second half of my life."
4,Delightful,"Young Bonnie Green lives in the grand Willoughby Chase with her loving parents and an assortment of kind servants in Aiken's own altered version of Victorian-era England. Bonnie's mother has fallen ill and her father is taking her on an extended journey at sea. Bonnie's father has sent for a distant relative, Miss Slighcarp, to look after Bonnie and her cousin Sylvia who is arriving from London on the same day. Things quickly take a turn for the worse under Miss Slighcarp's care.The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is a story full of hungry wolves, orphan schools, a boy and his geese, a trip by foot to London, parents that are presumed dead, kind doctors, and lying amnesiacs.Thoroughly enjoyable.The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is the first book in a series, thought Bonnie and Sylvia do not make appearances in subsequent books."
2,It was very unimaginative!,"The problem with this book is that they came up with extremly unimaginative words for the letters! For example, in this book, ""A"" is for ""apple"". They could have made it, ""A"" is for ""anarchy"", or ""A"" is for ""amoeba"". THis lack of imagination is why we keep falling behind the foreign competition!"
5,A thorough companion,"If you plan on visiting the Islands of Cape Verde, this travel guide is essential. I have not found a better or more thorough guide. I currently live here but I am American and I knew nothing of the islands when I arrived. But after living here a while, I discovered that this book is as accurate as I initially thought. There are few things misspelled but that is to be overlooked by the amount of truely uselful and thorough the information is. I also liked the little touches of background and history on each island. It is very well done."
2,Nothing new in here,"The book was very outdated and there's nothing new to learn that couldn't easily have been googled. As for visiting Cape Verde, we LOVED it."
1,These band-aids are all show with no quality.,"These bandaids are really fun to look at, that is if you can get them open without ruining them. They open up by pulling 2 tabs in the middle which inevitably makes both sides of the bandaid stick to eachother and therefore un-usable. When you actually manage to get one open without ruining it, they don't stick very well. Horrible!!! and a waste of money."
3,Not what I expected,"When the package said glitter, I expected these to use actual glitter. Rather, it is a hologram type material. It's okay and my friend's daughter still liked them - but it wasn't what I was hoping for."
4,Great for in-between cardio workouts,This is a great tape for those days when you don't want to get all sweaty doing cardio. Great for toning and sculpting. I have the Boot Camp video and love it as well. I thought my legs would hurt more the next day but I definitely felt it in different areas. You should just progress to higher weights. David Kirsch is a great motivator and breaks down all the moves for you. The last 15 minutes combine both butt and legs and you definitely feel it then. Highly recommended.
4,Effective low-impact training,"Overall happy with DVD. Exercises are low-impact but effective and you are definately sweating at the end. The overall feeling of the DVD is calming but David's voice is very monotone and boring. After I learned the proper techniques, I play my own music with the DVD."
2,Not that good,"David Kirsch needs to stop touting his own horn- his little ""distinctively david"" tips are annoying (because he is not the first person to come up with the workouts he teaches) and WE KNOW he works with stars like heidi klum- give it a rest already.Instead, for a really good weights (all round and in segments of arms, legs, butt, abs, plus extras) DVD buy Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2."
4,graceful,"This is a short, simple book that will appeal to fans of Hamsun - or those interested particularly in his arrest and trial following WWII. Knut wrote this book while in his nineties, living in a series of state hospitals and sanitariums, awaiting trial. It is not really a novel, but an assortment of rambling, journal-style entries and musings on life and old age. The simple beauty and frankness that are Hamsun's hallmarks are still vibrant in this late work.For first-time Hamsun readers, try Hunger instead."
3,One of their best CD's of all,This is a fast paced CD with an awesome cover. The best track is Magic Johnson. Other cathcy ones like sexy Mexican Maid and Good time Boys
4,Funkafied Slamma Bamma' Bing Bang Wooo!!!,"This re-master is really kickin'. I had this tape way back in the 90's when I was still in high school (wow, I'm getting old). I lost it with all my various moves around the world. I remember it was like a springboard in which I used it to learn how to play bass. The important thing about this reissued CD is that it sounds great and there are two bonus tracks which make me happy inside. I like the live version of Crosstown Traffic because it's hilarious and high powered voltage material. I also like the extended version of Knock Me Down (one of the best songs ever written about drug addiction and friendship). Now it makes more sense with the new chorus lines...which are more dynamic and heartfelt. I also like the extended version of Pretty Little Ditty...John and Flea are psychically linked with the rest of the universal matter that floats around in waves of molecular static that is called our solar system."
4,RED HOT !!!!!!!!!,"this is the first chili peppers album i bought and its definetley what got me into them.the way they seamlessly blend funk,rock,metal and other types of music is a true testament to them.the soaring vocals of anthony kiedis,crunching drumming of chad smith,funkified bass work by flea and john frusciante's smooth guitar work all blend and create a great album.high points......""SUBWAY TO VENUS"",""STONE COLD BUSH"",JOHNNY...KICK A HOLE IN THE SKY"""
3,Mother's Milk,"Not exactly their greatest cd, but still cool. It may seem to lack something because they did have like 3 albums in that one year. Nice songs. The peppers rendition of Jimi Henrix's (their inspiration and the man) FIRE is pure energetic acid funk. (could it be any cooler?) A lot of people don't know this, but PRETTY LITTLE DITTY has been copied over and over again in other bands. It is played as background music by other bands before they start the lyrics. People profitting off the Pepper's genius. sick. Anyway, a cool collectible and nice bass."
3,Large print a bonus,This large print book was a gift for my 97 year old mother. She loves short stories and could easily read the large print. She was thrilled.
5,Great Reading,Bought this for my 95-yr-old mom and she loved reading all of the classic stories. Just read it myself and it was a very enjoyuable read.
3,"UCLA Basketball under Wooden shines, telecast doesn't","As a UCLA fan, I've always wanted to see UCLA Basketball under John Wooden. The 1969 Championship game features a dominating Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lewis Alcindor, leading the Bruins to victory. You also get to watch other well known UCLA names as Shackleford, Vallely & Rowe. The downside is the reproduction of the telecast does not have frequent scores shown (or any graphics) and they cut out the free throws. Overall, a more complete glimpse into the glory years of UCLA hoops, but the production value of the original telecast pales in comparison to any event broadcasted in recent sports history."
3,It always closes on me.,"Even fully stacked with weight the stand isn't heavy enough to stand still. The legs slide all over the bathroom floor. Might work well on carpet? Anyhow, wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The pockets are shallow so the picture is misleading. It's not terribly sturdy and the legs don't move far enough apart to keep it from closing and falling over so I have it leaning against my wall, behind a door, instead. Not particularly handy to get to and the pockets don't have enough space for more than six magazines no thicker than the size of Entertainment Weekly. Anything else and it runs out of space, fast.I would have been better off buying a more expensive magazine rack because I'm going to have to buy another one to hold my other magazines anyhow.So, not a place that you want to save money unless you don't care if you ever see those magazines again."
5,No disspointment,The magazine rack works the way I wanted it to work. great purchase! Recommended for your home. Thanks for sending it on time.
4,NICE LOOKING,"The magazine rack is really simple, and the materials are kind of cheap. When I took it out from the box I thought of returning it, but I placed it in my cabin, and it doesn't look that bad. If you watch it closely you can see it is cheap, but I like that it keeps many magazines and it matches my cabin decor very well."
1,Not Pleased,"Very flimsy and wobbly, parts of the wood were not even sanded down all the way! One side of the rack the wood was split and sticking out! Can not hold a lot of magazines and still look nice like in the picture where each pocket contains only one magazine. You could easily make this in a high school industrial arts class and probably have the wood sanded down, smoother, and painted 10 times better than this one. I wouldnt mind it if the cost was MUCH less but for this price it is most definitly not worth it. I would pay no more than $8 for this."
4,good product,"yup it slides a bit, but it holds like 15-25 mags at a time, looks class, and has a nice appearance. it is smaller, so it doesnt take the entire room or a large space. it is less central to the the overall design of a room too (given its small size)."
1,Horiibly Amature,"Ohhhhhhhh jeeze where do i begin? THis game is just so horribly done that i cant believe anyone would actually ENJOY pl;aying it. HOLY COW!! but being an opptimist i have to find good in everything and there is good in this game. I loved the hillarios things people say, for example ""THey eat with their mouths? I think I'm going to be violently ill!"" and ""MOOOOOOOOO--=-Primitive, yet profound!"" haha but the rest of the game was horrible."
2,A disappiontment,I got this game off the discount rack at Wal-Mart. I enjoyed the ads for it. The game itself wasn't as exciting as I thought it wouuld be.
4,"so many brains, so little time.","I played the game for 4 hrs. straight it is the most fun i've had in a while, I mean how cool is it too fly in a saucer and blow stuff up, it's crazy. You can also fly in a jetpack,pick things up with telekinesis(with your mind) and fling them every which way. This is also a cool game for fans of sci-fi movies and the late 50's. The main character looks like the arbiter from Halo, but his abilities are much,much,cooler, like hipnotize people,read there thoughts, and more. My favorite is the saucer personally, that thing is awesome. I give this game a 5."
4,Fun for adults!,"It's great how you can manipulate the humans, animals, and objects with your mental powers and flying saucer. I do agree with another review on here, that this game sould have gotten an ""M"" rating...there is some language, and sexual references that some parents may not be too comfortable with.There is no easy, normal, difficult level selector, but the missions are relatively simple to complete. I do wish they would have used a larger variety of 'human' characters in the missions.Overall good game!"
4,Only if it was true,Destroy all Humans is unearthley fun i guess. It is all about Crptyo is looking for his brother that got cesed by the milatary in a earth invasion mission. Crypo jetpack is a cool gadget and lets you go places. It is really fun to blast humans heads open for brain DNA. This game has good graphics. And is tons of fun it could have been better but im not complaining. I give it 4 stars
4,Destroy All Humans!,"A few previous reviews were accurate in stating the repetative nature of the game, but beyond that the game is actually an excellent title. The atmosphere is DEFINATELY the game's high point, as the characters are fantastic spoofs off 1950's American Mentality. One level allows you to convince the populace that everything's alright simply by blaming Communism.All in all the game lacks the innovation to make it a perfect title, but is fantastic nonetheless. Definately worth a play!"
4,Grandson loves it!,My grandson asked for this and he loves it. He's 13 and happy and that's what counts to me.
4,Good game; shouldn't have been rated T.,"This game has a lot of really great elements in that it is somewhat interactive (not RPG-level interactive), has great graphics, smooth play, challenging missions, and a very interesting storyline. With that having been said, I am certain that is is not appropriate for younger teenagers (Teen is a 13 and over rating). There are drug references and suggestive language that many parents would not want their teenagers exposed to."
3,Good,This game is a lot of fun but it's pretty easy to beat. I still like to play it. The characters can do some pretty funny things to so it's funny at times
3,I love aliens,"I really enjoyed playing this game for the first couple of weeks. It was easy and it didn't take long to beat it, but I loved being able to destroy all those humans so much I was hooked. However, it did not take long for me to get tired of it, but while I did play it, I enjoyed it.I think the best part of the game is the hooky 50's dialogue which pokes fun at all things Americana. I actually read this week where one of the producers of King of Hill is developing the game into an animated TV series. It should be good if they stick to fun elements of the game.I you like the GTA style of play, and just want to sit in front of your XBOX and zone out for an hour or two this is the game for you. Its fun and it will make you laugh."
4,Crazy wacky fun!,"This game is so much fun! You simply go around terrorizing the people of Earth and steal their DNA. What I think is the funniest part of the game is the first level when you are on a farm and you can make humans, cows, and even chicken do the chicken dance by hypnotyzing them. Awesomely great game buy it!"
4,Good book,Basically an updated version of Trading for a Living with some real examples of Elder's trades at the very end. This is a must have for any Elder fan and a good book for an intermediate trader. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5. This is a close 2nd to my library of trading books - after Nison's Candlestick book.
2,"A mass market, beginner (but not enhanced) version of his","1993 classic ""Trading for a living"".For his previous book, I gave it a five star rating and a review title of ""If you are halfway from an amateur to a pro, it's for you"". Inevitably, I had great expectation of what the author would give after nine more years of the game. However, I assure you that 70% of the material and 90% of the essence had been covered in his previous book. Some new technical analysis tools were added. However, I truly believe that the author could have provided much more and better.For inexperienced beginners who seldom read trading books, this is okay."
3,There are a few nuggets,"Here's the thing. Trading books are difficult to write. Some books will be too technical (too mathematical, too refined) for some traders and some books will be too simple (how to open an account, how to calculate the correct amount to risk) for other traders. Striking a balance is tough. And this book does a pretty good job at that, which is probably why the book was so well received (and the title was pretty good as well). The most valuable piece of information in this book was almost an aside (pgs 75-77), and I have used it to create a trading living. So in a sense, I have learned how to trade for a living from this book. But there are other books that are better in terms of the ""how to"" in trading (systems, exits, etc). This book is well worth it for the trader looking for how to *approach* trading for a living. To me, that is the true value in this book."
5,Highly Recommended,Extremely well written even a beginning trader will understand. I highly recommend this book especially for traders who've been trading actively but seem to be getting nowhere. A book worth keeping.
3,Doesn't practice what he preaches,"I must agree with the previous reviewer (pkrider).Mr Elder spends a lot of time laying out the seemingly robust tenets of sound trading, only to blow his credibility in the last chapter, which reviews actual trades.To spend the majority of the book laying out the rationale for trend trading and multiple timeframe analysis and then to contradict oneself by solely reviewing trades involving trading against the trend (automatically negating the usefulness of multiple timeframe analysis) was strange, to say the least.Overall, a good book, but not a seminal work. Van Tharp's books are better."
5,Hands down the best book on trading...,"I LOVE this book. After reading this book I have full confidence as a trader and feel very comfortable about making money in the market. This book analysis all aspect of being a successful trader including the mentality and the money management skill that almost all other trading books leave out. If you are ready to get on the same level as money managers and become a ""winning"" trader - this book is key!!! Well worth the 40 bucks and well worth 100 bucks if you ask me. The money you make/save trading will more than make up for the price of the book. The only part about the book I didn't like was the first 100 pages which was a little more fluff than I needed to read. However, for a beginner investor, it is nice/needed. Also I thought the writting style was entertaining and not as dry and chalkly as other investment books that put me to sleep. This book presents many exciting and logical ideas that will keep your interest. EXCELLENT!!!"
3,Reading is in progress,"Hi I am reading the book slowly. However, from what I read from the introductory pages and what I sensed through the cursory glance I made through the headings of the book, the topics appear to be quite versatile."
1,same old stuff,"This guy is so NEGATIVE!!! I have traded for 3 years and must admit his first book was ok, it made me very conscious of expenses and their impact on your profitability. (Most traders make 1 to 2 cents a share so trading costs must be controlled.) Guess what, Elder goes back over this area again and again and again.Elder is not a good writer. He wanders, he repeats himself, he goes off about a ""loser"" trading gold futures instead of spending time with his family. He writes about owning a PC with kilobytes instead of megabytes. It's so hopelessly mixed up that I hope he gets to the point. But there is none.Save your money,the guy can't write."
5,Amazingly good and helpful !,"The book is realy very good.He talked in detail about almost everything.Talked about psychology better than a whole book in one chapter "" I have read a whole book about this topic and never get more information than what he said""explained beautifuly and nicely, HOW the trade must be executed: from A to Z. I have not find yet a better method than his.Was great showing us how money could and must be managed.Disclsing his own trading diary is the top of what he made in the book. It is realy like inviting someone to your bedroom!! But for no pupose but to our favorit, he made it. Don't hesitate buy it now!"
3,Simplistic,"This book is merely a simplistic overview strictly for newcomers. It attempts to address all angles and ends up being a 'Jack of all trades' gloss over important subjects.If you are new to the game I would consider it as an introduction but, if you are already trading...don't waste your time."
5,Come Into My Trading Room,"This is an excellent book on trading which is the first one I have ever read that shows one how to determine quickly whether a particular market is ready to be traded. It also sets forth an approach to handling various time frames for a market and what trend-following indicators and oscillators to use therewith. This book, combined with Dr. Elder's earlier one Trading for a Living, are the only two books a beginner or an experienced trader would ever need to read and study to become successful. I wish I had had these two books ten years ago when I started trading futures."
5,Excellent Book to strat trading,"this is the book for the beginner trader, the one that has no plane or little knowledge.it focus on swing trading, but gives you solid ground where to start andwhat to use.covers the most importent aspects of trading: psycology, methode, money managmet and money.i highly recommended this book for every one."
4,Sequal to trading for a living,"Very good book. I agree that the charts could have been better and more relevant to wha Elder was discussing in the text. His mental toughness section is excellent. Trading is a mental game, and a trader has to stay mentally tough or take a break. Mark Douglas's books are the best on this. Laurence Connors places a big emphasis on this too."
5,The Best Guide - It Saved me,Covers all aspects of Trading with tremendous insights. It changed the way I trade and saved me from heading towards financial ruin. Brilliant! I have read hundreds of books but this is the best by far.
5,Excellent book!,"I read Trading for a Living a few years ago and was amazed by the author's insight into the trader's mind. In this book I did find some common material but it served more as a refresher than a repeat. There is a lot more new information (SafeZone stops, money management, other markets etc) This book works great for both long term as well as short term traders. Knowledge is everything and learning from mistakes is priceless. Truly an amazing book and I can imagine a lot of traders reading it and feeling it was written for them. Also, the author recommends not blindly following his examples but learning from them and fine tuning the indicators to suit our needs. All in all, a great book!"
5,Good product,Does the job very well. Very useful. Was great for our museum exhibit of tea cups and etc. We would purchase again.
1,Awesome dryer BUT.....,"This is an awesome dryer and a dryer that far surpasses any other so far as technology, weight and drying time. It actually cuts drying time in half and weighs LESS than a pound but guess what?? There is a two year warranty and ONLY guaranteed if bought through a haircare professional. BUMMER!"
5,A NOTE ABOUT THE WARRANTY ISSUE,"I am in the market for a fabulous dryer for my natural african-american hair. I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty."
5,The best of Black Adder,"My review will not be as well done as others I have read. I will just say - these are awesome! It has been a while since we watched Black Adder on our local PBS station. Watching these has been a reminder of the fun they are. This is my favorite of Rowan Atkinson's series though Thin Blue line is a close 2nd. Other humor we enjoy are Allo Allo, Vicar of Dibly, Jeeves and Wooster, and Are you being served to give an idea of what we enjoy. The charaters are great and over the top (of course). I hope you enjoy these as much as we have."
5,Made for a very happy Christmas,"I bought this as a gift for a fella who was already getting way too many gifts from me, but the price was outrageously good (more than half off list) so what could I do?He was so excited when he unwrapped it, he may have squealed.Great packaging, great presentation, tons of extras. I haven't seen any version but this, so I can't comment on the remastering thing. It was shot on video and looks like video. But some of the problems that other reviews mention with the previous DVD release (weak blacks, fuzzy bits) aren't really found here."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I love Brit Coms and Brit Mysteries etc. I love most things British. But I just didn't really like Black Adder at all. I figured I wouldn't. I mean there were some funny moments and Rowan did great of course! But it just wasn't for me. I think I will give my copy I bought of this to my friend that wanted one for Christmas. I love all of my other Brit coms very much and watch them over and over! Keeping Up Appearances, Are You Being Served, One Foot In The Grave, The Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers, Open All Hours, Thin Blue Line, Mr. Bean, As Time Goes By, Waiting For God, Are You Being Served Again. I'm thinking those are all I have so far except the mysteries of Rosemary & Thyme. Waiting for Miranda to become available here. But unfortunately B. Adder didn't do it for me. I am glad there are so many people that love this show though because I am all for anyone loving British Comedy!"
5,another great album,"its another solid album from one of the best unknown guitar players in the country.great playing from start to finish,good blues lyrics with agreat voice singing them."
3,Decent Album,"If you have always liked Corey Stevens like me you would say that you like this set, but it is still the same set of the same old thing. Nothing new here. It sounds like Corey is running out of new ideas and is walking thru each song. I like his first two albums the best but this one sounds uninspiring and kind of boring to me. He has a nice voice and is a good guitar player. If you like his music I suggest you get it, but there is nothing new here. It is kind of short--less than 45 min"
3,Earthbound,"This recording never grabbed me, but I revisited it after listening toEugene Ormandy Conducts 20th Century Classics. Where the Ormandy shimmers with celestial textures, the Davis seems leaden and never gets off the ground."
5,Know Your History,"I ordered two copies of the ""Chronicles"" and they arrived in excellent shape. My friends were so impressed with this book, that I am going to order two more to give as gifts. Great for grandchildren, as well."
1,2nd review,"Didn't receive the first order. A second order was sent. Didn't receive that one, plus seller wouldn't respond to emails or provide product tracking. I did however receive an email asking that I would consider changing my review. I didn't, could be the reason the replacement shipment didn't arrive either."
5,best bathroom reading I've found,"this book is awesome. It gives you a picture into history by using photographs, timelines and newspaper articles."
5,Excellent!,"This book has helped me win several trivia contests. :) Its also a great history reference. It makes a great, albeit heavy, gift."
5,It is one of the most fascinating books in the world,The Chronicle deals with all major incidents of the 20th century. It is a delightful combination of facts and readability. It is definitely a must read.
5,This Monkey is Superfly!,"(Wade's Wife)""This monkey really is superfly. A friend sent a 4 pk for Christmas, which I opened early of course. I immediately ran out in the yard and aimed one at my husband. You should've seen the look on is face when that screeching, caped crusader shot past his head. Oh, this monkey is so fun. Seriously, it's hilarious! I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't seem to easily fly as far as in the video, but it's so crazy and fun, I changed my mind."""
4,"Fun, in an annoying brother kind of way.","I have to say that my 8 year old son and his friends love these guys.I don't mind hearing the monkey screech the first 15-20 times, but honestly I can't wait until spring so they can go outside.Lost 1 star because I'm out of Tylenol."
2,A Disappointing Purchase,"Yes, they are cute, but that is where it ends. We (the adults) can hardly make these ""fly"" 10 feet.....forget about the 50 feet as advertised. We have played and played with these trying to get them to fly. No luck. My 12 yr old is not able to get it to work either. A disappointing purchase."
3,entertains for a short while,"Bought these for my grandsons, ages 6, 61/2,10, 12. They played with them for about 20 minutes, then tired of the monkeys and went back to playing with foam airplanes. My dog, however, was facinated for a longer time, although he wasn't allowed to play with the monkeys. I have heard that some adults find them much more entertaing than the kids."
5,Lets RA-DI-ATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This upbeat session from the Radiators is one long and wonderful musical romp.The Radiators give good heat and sustain it beautifully from start to finish. Throughout they generate the 'feel good' vibe that is the signature of New Orleans music, most notably on Let's Radiate!There are a handful of covers here, but not to worry; in this live session numbers like The Twist, Cripple Creek, No Expectations and Down on the Corner all maintain their vitality. The performance goes bluzy in heavy doses, then ends on a high note that encourages you to start all over again, this time sans Prozac. So ignore the detritus that sometimes passes for music today; get this and confirm that music CAN *send you* to the groove 'n elevate that mood...however be warned, cause this ain't no 'elevator music'!In a delayed intro that comes after four vigorous tracks, the man sez;""if you're lookin for reality...it aint here!""Highly recommended good time stuff!"
2,"""Academic"" oriented.",I was looking for an analysis of more basic use of metaphors common in today's day-to-day communications.Maybe OK for professional students common in today’s higher education institutions.
1,Why?,"Generally speaking, human beings prefer to frame new knowledge in terms that they are already familiar with. Metaphor is therefore one the most common ways of expressing compound ideas in a simple yet powerful/effective manner.'The sands of time', for example, though originating from the use of sand in an hour glass, is a metaphor rich with alternative images and meanings.But how long can you go on making this very basic point?In the case of ""Metaphors We Live By"" the answer is 'over 200' pages. Which is, in this reviewer's opinion, at least 200 pages TOO LONG.Many of the examples are either extremely strained, or simply inconsequential. Is ""happiness"" ALWAYS equated with ""up""? (How about ROTFLMAO?) And even if it were, so what?By the time I got to the end of this thoroughly academic text, my primary thought was simply WHY?Why did the authors bother to write it?Why did the publishers bother to publish it?And why would anyone bother to read it (if they knew in advance what it was like)?"
4,"Excellent thesis, clear presentation","This book will change the way you look at language. Often, when we think we are being literal and direct, we are using metaphors. And we don't even know it. After reading this book you will catch yourself in metaphorical folly. This will help you think more clearly and argue better; you will be better able to spot false analogies and arguments based on misleading metaphors. This book is a bit dated now, but still worth a read."
3,A little obvious,"The book's focus is on the fact that many of the sayings we use in daily life can be seen as metaphors for more literal explanations. For example it takes a chapter to explain how we feel that ""up"" is ""good"" and ""down"" is ""bad."" It is not really a book for reading. It is a philosophical look at language. If you like 200 pages of explaining how the saying ""You're the top"" is a metaphor for about the top being better than the bottom than this is the book for you."
4,good 80's Metal,"A good metalhead Belgian speed and power metal cd of the mid 80's. I had not really heard of the band until the reissue of 2 in 1 from Mausoleum Records ""See you in Hell"" and ""Second Attack"" I think the singer on this album went on to sing with the Belgian band Ostrogoth and Mystery and The German band Affair. Peter De Wint (not the famous painter) vocals are really outstanding on See you in Hell cd. Like all good metal bands things usually change for the worst. I do not think we well here any more in your face metal form Peter. He is preparing a self titled recording under Peter Qin melodic stuff? He tours sometimes with Glenn Hughes. If you are into hard rock keep a eye on him.Cross Fire's first appearance was on the compilation Metal Glogs.Keep it hard and heavy..............."
4,Beautiful!,"A very beautiful pendant. The gems are actually a little bit lighter than pictures, but are a very pretty subtle blue. Great for casual or dressy attire!"
3,"It's Like Master P, But Not Really","Calling this CD anything besides a novelty in your CD collection is possibly the most blatant lie ever said. While some may scurry at a band that counts garbage pails among its instruments, others may just dig the groove Doo Rag can sometimes come up with between songs consisting largely of very loud mumbling ad out-of-tune guitars."
2,Spend the money on a Leapers UTG,"A nice, METAL UTG/ Leapers sight with red and GREEN dot adjustable aiming can be purchased for just $30Simply search for ""Leapers Red dot Sight""Far SuperiorUTG sight is beast..."
1,Returned it,"I think this would be perfect if you are looking for a small/portable cribbage board. Say you were going camping and wanted to take the game along this would probably be just what you were looking for.I was looking for a nice board for my parents, and this just seemed cheap and small. I returned it."
2,Poorly made,"Very poorly made - holes not drilled deep enough to hold pegs, improper number of holes for a standard cribbage board (row of holes missing because of where the board hinges), there is no latch to hold the board closed when it is folded so it is not actually convenient for travel as the cards and pegs can fall out easily, hinges were already bent upon arrival such that board does not line up flush when folded."
2,Flimsy quality,"I like the fold up design and considered making one like it but decided to save time from drilling many holes accurately. I am very disappointed in the quality. Wood surface is rough, wood is poor quality, I don't expect the small weak hinges to last . I may have to replace parts, or just use it for a pattern to make a decent one.Not worth the price."
2,Poor instructions.,Instructions more for someone who already knows how to play. Scoring difficult to understand. Would not purchase again. Not a fast paced game. Very slow and boring.
3,Enchanted Rope Burns....,"Having been an Enchant fan for the past few years, I am dissapointed to say that this one falls short of what I expected. The excellent musicianship is still there, it jsut lacks the great melodies that Enchant is known for. Some exceptions are ""Living in a Movie"", ""Long Way Down"", and ""Comatose""..There is also a great instramental appropriately named ""Progtology""...New fans might enjoy, I just expected MORE....This CD was produced in less than 1 year, and it sounds rushed (no pun intended!)."
4,Solid effort from a great band,"This is a solid release from a great neo-prog band. Enchant has never quite been able to recapture the magic or consistency of their first three albums, but Tug of War is still a very good entry in the Enchant catalog. The first and last tracks, Sinking Sand and Comatose, are both awesome, and the tracks in between are consistently good. Ted Leonard still has one of the best voices around (in my opinion), and Doug Ott's guitar work is great as usual. If you are already a fan of Enchant, I would say that this CD is worth getting. If you aren't familiar with Enchant, I would recommend starting instead with one of their first three releases (A Blueprint of the World, Wounded, and Time Lost), or perhaps with their recent double-disc live release ""Live at Last."""
3,"Enchant : ""Tug Of War"" Falls Short.....","This is a ""Tug Of War"" release from Enchant for me. I'm having a very hard time enjoying this as much as their previous efforts. As someone posted before, it sounds hurried IMO. It's still a very solid effort as far as musicianship is concerned....""Tug Of War"" isn't bad, it's just not excellent. Everything else, from their debut on have been masterpieces. This unfortunately, is a step back IMO..."
1,Yawn...,"This is nothing but a bunch of talented musicians who lack decent songwriting skills. There are just too many bands out there like this. Vamping melodies in polyrhythms, a bridge, and then a repeat of the same vamping melodies that goes off into tangents with the singer suddenly wailing off-key.I finished listening to this disc and couldn't really remember anything that I heard, that's how unmemorable it is.Time to take a nap..."
1,Never heard anything by this band that didnt make me,Never heard anything by this band that didnt make me want to puke.The singer is a joke and the music is nothing .Save your money
4,Angsty- but pretty good,"I am usually hesitant to watch a gay film as usually the acting is terrible and very focused on just shirtless guys. This film was surprisingly well acted, had a pretty good storyline (however completely implausible and fantasy), and linked some of modern phone apps and computer dating to issues of men in relationships. I would recommend this film for sure."
3,So So!,I thought that this film would be more sexually charged and it wasnt. It was over all an ok film!
2,eStupid,"This movie was nothing short of stupid. Houston Rhines, though very attractive, was flat and dull in his role. Overall, I thought this was a waste of time and money."
4,Fun Movie,An enjoyable movie with an App that was both annoying and perhaps useful ! Morgan Fairchild as a guest appearance a Bonus. :)
3,WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE,"Here is a gay film in which the acting , directing and photography are excellent. The trouble is that we have seen similar themed films so many times before. There is nothing new or original in this film.As usual the people all live in expensive houses which seem far too unaffordable for the work they do. The SHAMELESS TV series was a rare example of the homes that have that lived in look.It is doubful that the cast could afford to live in the homes depicted in this film .Its a enjoyable film but nothing more."
4,Light and Uplifting,"A surprisingly professionally-made movie (rare for gay films) - good cinemaphotography, enjoyable soundtrack and, most importantly, well acted by an attractive and endearing cast. I loved it! A cute story that is the perfect tonic after a hard day! Would be enjoyable to watch with friends. Definitely recommend it!"
3,A fun concept...,"I don't set a high bar for romantic comedies - they are mind candy, and fun is the key. This film has some great ideas behind it, and has some good acting as well. All the technical pieces such as sets, lighting, camera work are well done - the production values are beyond your typical indie. It is a very white and male world these characters live in, though the forced in politically correct character might be worse. The biggest weak point is the script. It is poorly laid out, feels like there is a lot of filler. In other words, it would have made a great short, as a full length film, there are plenty of times you will wish it would just get on with it."
4,Very enjoyable but traditional romantic comedy,"This is a real throw-back to the days of Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies. The actors are very appealing, the situations are amusing, and the whole family could enjoy this movie (grandma and grandpa included). I would give it a G rating (anyone could see it).If you are looking for a well-made, well-acted light romantic comedy, this is a good choice. If you are looking for skin, look elsewhere.Have fun."
4,ecupid DVD,"I enjoyed this movie and the actors and the story line was simple, easy to follow and actually reminded me of my relationship but not the same result. I would recommend this to others."
1,Borrringgg,"This is a slow, boring gay movie with no bite, no excitement and bad acting. Morgan Fairchild is in it for maybe 4 minutes. Boring, slow, nothing exciting. Waste of my time and money. It felt like the actors hated to be in it, and you can't blame them."
2,Hmmm,"Predictable. Unfortunately the movie felt like an after school special. The acting is really good, I just wish the storyline was better..."
1,banal and boring,"why do nearly all gay themed movies have to be so bad? i was particularly excited about this one. a contemporary gay romance that deals with technology and social networking, sounds promising. unfortunately the acting is a joke and the script is boring. the dialogue falls flat in every scene and it somehow manages to be predictable and unbelievable at the same time. the character development is non-existent. you never really get to know who these people are and what motivates them beyond the surface level. there is no depth to the plot and a photo-montage is not enough back-story to adequately convey the connection the two main characters are supposed to have with each other, but never really comes across. this film is a waste of time and money. just don't even bother."
3,What if the gadgets take our lives over,"Comparing to ""Is it just me"", ""E-cupid"" is a big step forward. It's like these two films were created by completely different people.Of course the latter one is not a masterpiece, but at least it kept my attention to the very last minute. The acting is not bad, there are better and worse moments. Of course the best performance is delivered by Morgan Fairchild. Although, I have this impression that they invited her just to have a well-known name on the posters.If you seek for a light romcom, not too challenging, then ""E-cupid"" is perfect for you."
2,Just ok,"Wasn't expecting much going in and certainly didn't get the 'wow' factor, but concept was kind of cute. Acting and script need work, but that's what comes along with indie romantic comedies."
2,Boring,"This movie was boring, but it wasn't terrible. I definitely would not watch it again, nor would I recommend it."
2,Plays like a made for tv movie,"Slow predictable script, full of cliches. No character development anywhere that I noticed. The one saving grace to this film is morgan fairchild, still beautiful for her age but not a large enough role to save the film. Not worth renting."
3,Good entertainment but lack-lustre characterisations,"Loved watching it because of its entertainment value although I wasn't thrilled by the less-than-passionate character portrayals - for a couple who'd been in love for 7 years, coming back together after a near-break up was kind of, well, passionless. For instance, I didn't feel anything in the kissing between the two male leads - it was like dry pecks on your grandmother's cheek. If it was meant to be a celebration of love, especially the love between two men, my take is that the portrayals of the two lead characters could have been more physically energetic because that's how men, generally, express love - with a big dash of lust thrown in. In the end, the film didn't take me on a celebratory high so, it was a little disappointing from that perspective."
5,Each man takes a unique approach into these fine numbers.,"These hardworking rockers get up at 5am to practice. Can your favorite band do that? Fans of Sugar,Carlinhos Brown,and The Alan Parsons Project : Today is your lucky day!"
5,Ghost Riders,"A very suspenseful satisfying read that kept me interested as do all her Sharyln McCrumb's books. I look books about mountain folk, folktales with a bit of twist and all things southern. Southern comfort stories take me back to the stories of old I have been told. Great read."
4,Fun to read,"Ms McCrumb did an excellent job! Her book is entertaining, informative (regarding the history of the Appalachians), and her prose was a joy to read. Other reviewers didn't appreciate her style of going back and forth between the past and present characters, but I thought it worked well into the story, and gave the novel another dimension. After reading Ghost Riders, I plan to read Ms McCrumb's other books; as I really enjoyed her writing style."
2,Very Dull,"The author had an excellent idea and a few good lines but overall didn't do justice to the ghost story genre.Perhaps if she re-named the book to attract a different audience, she would get more happy readers.I am not a big civil war buff so my opinion is a little bias. On the other hand, I tried and tried to get interested in the characters and Ghost Riders still bored me to tears."
3,On My NewYork S**t!!!,"This is what NY is missing....That gutta, str8 flowing with hard NY underground beats. Lake is not the most gifted rapper but he does get his point across. Cormega is on most of the songs but this is Lakes solo album, so don't expect a Mega album.Lake keeps it street but also shows his other faces on the album. Tracks like ""Q.U. Side"", ""Walk Through Heaven"", and ""Don't Start"" are some of my favorites. Out of the 18trks I skip about 3 songs which ain't bad. Hip-Hop still has a pulse, thanks Lake and Mega!!! Hotep!!!"
1,it was great... for about 2 days,"i was really excited about this item. i was doing a lot of baking around the holidays and was eager to put the measuring spoons away. this item was really useful. then i ran it through the dishwasher. the numbers wiped off the side of the glass. the description said the item was dishwasher safe, but it proved not to be so. i now have a single $6 juice glass instead. hopefully i can find a more durable model of this elsewhere."
3,Hmm,Pros: Lightweight gloves. Rubber grips really helps; when handling tiny screws it *almost* feels as if you're using your real hands.Cons: Its not waterproof. I wonder how that affects insulation if your palms become sweaty due to prolonged work.
4,"handy, maybe a lil pricey..","Once, while doing maintenance a simple plug out plug in of my sata drive fried it !! Yes a SMART error eventually.. SO I decided that I should go in for a anti static instrument. Initially I was thinking of the wrist band. Then I was wondering if it really worked and where am I gonna hook it. So I bought this glove and it is pretty great.Pros -Rubberized dots do give grip.Does not fry anything!Cons-Gets dirty as all components are dusty (but can be washed gently, else the dots may pop out!)Ripping stuff out takes a lil getting used to/difficult since your wearing gloves (duh!)"
5,Satisfied,"Western Digital 320GB 3.5"" 7200RPM PATA Bulk/OEM Hard Drive WD3200AAJBWestern Digital OEM 320GB HD received and operational. Packagedsafely. Humming along at 33C."
3,Nice pictures,Nice stories for a child with good pictures. Don't like the fact that I have to write more than I wish to.
4,Great introduction to Buddhist teachings for little ones,"I bought this to read at night with my 3 year old.After a few reads I've found him picking up the book himself to look at the pictures and ask me questions about the stories.It's short enough to read read all the way through, but we'll typically read just one or two of the stories at a time and talk about them.The pictures are well done and very helpful for a little one in keeping their attention and helping illustrate the action.Highlighy recommended and glad we got it!"
3,Not for kids under 8,"I bought this book to give my children some insight into other religious views than Christianity, but it is not meant for children under 8, in my opinion. The stories are not tailored for younger ears as there is no attempt to remove the exploitation of living beings from the lessons. I understand that it is a telling of Buddha's messages, but there could be more of a digression from the true story to make the tales a good bedtime read to those children under the age of 8."
1,Worthless,I bought this knife on vacationin Alaska because I lost my Rapala filet knife. First the knive does not come with any kind of edge. You cannot get an edge on it using the sharpener on the bottom of the case. When I did get an edge on it using someone else sharpener it was sharp for about half way through one salmon. This is junk. Don't waste your time or money. I'm going to throw mine away and buy another Rapala.
2,Looking for enlightenment? Look elsewhere.,"My expectations were for more in depth discussions on deriving more meaning in life, but the book is mostly narrowly focuses on traditional christian concepts and beliefs. Though I can relate to the concept of what the book was trying to say, I didnt get very much out of it."
3,Rating at the half way point in the book,"I am going through this book with a group of friends. I really like the concept of evaluating where you are an making sure the second half of you life is leading to significance in a Godly manner.However, I was turned off by the over the top set of experiences the author comes from. I just continued to find it hard to relate to this guy. The group discussion has been very positive and from that perspective it has been worth the purchase.I have been getting more out of Verticle Church and Experiencing God."
2,"If you already made a fortune, this book is for you. Otherwise...","Nothing very practical in this book and it would probably have been better marketed as an autobiography. Because he has plenty of money, he has the luxury of thinking big and so forth.For those looking for a new/better or different life goals, I'd look elsewhere.Also, it wasn't very well written or compelling and I have to admit, I started skimming it."
3,A good concept but not a books worth of material here,"I like the concept of ""halftime"" but I felt like the author was stretching his material out to fill pages. He repeated himself several times. Could have been covered in a long magazine article or a chapter in another book."
4,For those seriously evaluating the 2nd half of their lives!,"I found this book to be en excellent starting point for anyone (more specifically men, written by a man) who is interested in seriously thinking through a life plan of what you are going to do with the rest of your life. Those who find themselves asking the question ""do I want to do what I'm doing for the next 10-20 years"" will be intetested in what the author has to say.Even if you have not asked that question yet this book will provide insight into where you are probably headed...Best considered by those who are determined to be honest with themselves reguardless of the cost and are willing to do something to change their current situation."
5,This book hit home!,"When I decided to take an early retirement from my company of 30+ years, a friend recommended that I read this book. I couldn't believe how it hit the mark with me. Granted, I am what I would consider to be a 'spiritual person', but aside from that, Buford really hit the nail on the head with many of the feelings that I had been experiencing of late.. That is, the entire notion of putting 'significance' ahead of 'success' in life. Isn't that what everyone would want to leave as his/her legacy?I enjoyed the book, and found it to be relevant, interesting, and a fast read. I recommend it for anyone who is moving into a mid-50s 'retirement' period, sorting out the opportunities that are out there."
2,Concept vs. Applicability,"This was a nice story about a guy making a journey from success to significance in the second half of his life. Unfortunately, most of us don't have the financial resources to do things the way he did them. Conceptually, what he is saying is appropriate. However, most of us don't have the millions that allow for extended time off to reflect, seek the help of consultants, conduct low cost probes, etc.If you're looking for a nice inspirational story of one man's journey in faith, this is a good read. If you're looking for some strong Biblical insights on which to make some life change, this is not the book to use for that."
2,Profound ideas diluted by evangelism and personal wealth,"The book offers excellent suggestions on making one's life more significant, especially in the second half. Bob's personal examples are powerful. Unfortunately, it seems to come from the perspective of a wealthy white man, including virtually all the examples of other men which he frequently uses to make points. With the multiple quotations of Biblical scripture the bent is somewhat evangelic.If you are not a devout, fundamentalist Christian, you may find it difficult to mine the nuggests of wisdom.If you are not wealthy, you may also struggle with the book. As you may not have the flexibility, Bob seems to think ""everyone"" has for the second half of life. Examples from those less fortunate than he would strengthen the book."
5,Significant life marker,"Bob shows us how to stop and evaluate our life, determine how happy we are with it, or not, and lead us in brief steps to bring significance into it. A necessary read for everyone at all ages."
4,Half Time,This is a truly attractive book for readers who have come to the age of 'half-time' ie. some 40 to 45 year of age. The feeling and experience of the writer is so real that it enables you to reflect quickly on yourself against what the writer invites you to ponder on. I fell into some very deep thinking and I read the book only to find that I am devoted to choosing another path for the second half of my life.
1,Too much religion for my taste,"I really wanted to like this book - to get something out of it. However, I couldn't get past the second paragraph. There were simply too many biblical references and too much ""God"" for my taste. I expected this to be a business book, it was more aptly filed in the ""religious studies"" section of the book store."
3,Okay,"A book designed to make you think about what you're going to do with the second half of your life to make it meaningful. Mostly good, touching on a very compelling topic. However, I don't necessarily agree with the author's premises regarding what defines success early or late in life, so the three stars."
5,Money interest and the Bottom Line!,"I've read both of Pool books, and I've found them both very insightful on the American, England and German ""money"" interest in the Nazi's rise to power. Without their backing, Germany would have fallen into a communist state in the early 1930s. Certainly, the high-powered money interest of Europe preferred the Nazi Party to the communist. This is why the ""money"" interest supported the Nazi party. Understanding this truth is key to understanding the Nazis rise to power.We all know what Hitler's views were, but we haven't until Pool research, addressed what powerful forces were instrumental in his rise to power. As a history major, Pool represents what the craft of history is all about. A high recommended reading for anyone."
3,Pretty but limited practicality,"This rug's colors are closer to burgundy and mahogany than to chocolate tones. The tan is more beige and the lightest squares dark ivory. The rug is an average buy for the money, and is comparable to something you could buy in the ""big box"" stores. This rug does show up every bit of dirt, hair, etc and requires lots of maintaining. It also look quite a while to get the corners to lay flat. It is pretty and I would buy it again for a low traffic area."
2,Pretty but not what it seemed.,"I bought this rug on the notion that it was going to be a great fit for our apartment, which it was. But when we unrolled it put it out and put our coffee table on it, it stayed curled up on one side. We never rectified this situation and though the rug was at a reasonable price, it is now rolled back up in one of our closets. Just never expected to buy something that was so nice and have it not turn out good....would not recommend this rug to those looking for that special something for your apartment or house.We moved into a house and finally rectified the curled rug situation.......it took a bit of lying flat outside but it now sits on our reading room floor and looks gorgeous! I love the way it looks and now I would be glad to recommend it to others. Just an update on ours....hope it helps."
3,It's just okay,"The price is what you get - it's not a solid heavy rug. Little flimsy. But I do have pads under them. The color is perfect burgundy - exactly what I needed. These rugs I am using in my family room. I am okay with the quality as I have two dogs and with age they will just trash them eventually (dog prints, hair and old age) so these rugs will be fine for now. Once my dogs are older and gone, then I will buy a higher quality rug. Would not recommend for high traffic areas at all. Like others said, rug is really wrinkled and curled at ends and takes a long time to uncurl. I used heavy books along the curled edges for days to straighten out. Or lying them on a warm sunny day in your driveway would help too!"
4,"Good, worth the price","A good, comfortable, and nice looking rug for the price. Not a high end look, but for $100 or so, it's better than I thought it would be."
4,Get to know the girl next door,"Ever since her ""Father Knows Best"" days, Elinor Donahue has been a familiar presence on our screens. She always seemed so ""up"". Is that real, or just acting? After reading this unusual book that is both an autobiography and a cookbook, I've reached the conclusion that Elinor is real, on-screen and off. I don't recall reading a single word in which she said anything bad about anyone. She seems to be as charming and optimistic as her image. She's a lady in the truest sense of the word, and it was a delight to read her book. Now to try out some of those terrific recipes . . . ."
4,Very enjoyable,"I have gotten alot of use out of this disc. The music is a lush, keyboard- driven sound with very nice lead guitar fills, excellent drumming, pleasant vocals and catchy melodies. The ONLY reason I don't rate this release with five stars is a slight lack of originality. Once again, the band's sound relies quite heavily on the Genesis/ Marillion configuration (which to me is quite pleasant.) The music moves along at a quite even pace, without alot of frills or flambouyant soloing, but is quite relaxing and enjoyable. ""Good As Gold"" is easily my favorite tune, with a very catchy melody that will stick in your mind for days, but each track is strong and memorable. One of the few albums I actually enjoy listening to from start to finish, which in these days of bands trying to fill CD space, is a tremendous compliment. Very much worth checking out if you like the Genesis sound recorded on modern equipment."
5,Melodies long forgotten,"It is one of the albums that any serious listener of progressive rock or heavy metal must have. Although the melodic line is soft and rather mellow, it has a strength found in bands like Genesis, Marillion and Pink Floyd. The Floyd-ish sound is most obvious in track 4. The masterpiece in this album is track 3, ""Paintbox"" that deserves serious listening."
3,Pleasant Surprise,"A preasant surprise for me. This is the first Pendragon music that I have heard even though I was interested in Genesis and Marillion in earlier years, I hadn't heard of Pendragon.These days I pick up odd CDs that may be of interest. This is one of my better semi random plucks of the year.Long and detailed songs, well played, but, I guess what is missing for me is 'contrast', highs and lows, maybe you could call it excitement.I'm not disappointed that I bought it though."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT SO MUCH","Masquerade Overture is not a good experience to iniciate about Pendragon. I prefer The World, Window of Life (bnus track) or Not of this World, these are 5 stars. As Good As Gold is the only song that catches me. The Pursuit Of Excellence, The Shadow, Masters Of Illusion and Paintbox are good songs too, but not excellent."
3,not the best...,"I was disappointed that the entire book was specific to jewelry boxes. The title said ""making jewelry, art & heirloom boxes.""On the other hand, the boxes were pretty great. Stowe is obviously an artisan, always creating new ways to open the boxes and hide hinges. The patterns were detailed, giving a complete bill of materials for each project.Not for a beginner, though. Plus, you have to have a router table for just about every project."
4,Simply Beautiful Book,"For those of us used to pristine ""how-to"" photos, its great to see an author with a few nicks and cuts on his hands, and I do beleive I saw a thumb nail (real) with a bruise caused by a hammer blow.This is a ""no-nonsense"" bible for those of us interested in box making.Excellent."
2,I must have missed something...,"Nowhere on this page did I see that this book was ALL jewelry boxes. And somewhat ugly ones at that. There are a few decent designs and good techniques in here, but a triangle jewelry box? C'mon..."
3,In the Footsteps of the actor,"The best portrayal of Jesus in any film was Robert Powell in the 1977 mimi series, ""Jesus of Nazareth"".. I thought Marchiano was waaaay over the top and that his performance fell more in the category of amateur. That being said, I thought the book was somewhat insightful but as I read on it kept reminding me that it was more about walking in the footsteps of Mr. Marchiano rather than Jesus. Not recommended"
5,A remarkable description of a close relationship with Christ,"Watching the movie and reading the book, Bruce displays a closeness to the Lord like none other I've ever seen. The book is captivating and it inspiring."
4,also get the video,"the book is an excellent accompaniment to the Matthew video,telling about the preparation for and incidents during filminga must read"
5,A Spirit-refreshing glimpse into the loving heart of Jesus.,"This book touched my life in a way that no other has. Bruce's writing is so fresh and conversational that you feel he is sitting in your home and chatting with you--about what matters most in the world! He makes his heart and thoughts transparent so that the reader can get a clear view into the heart of Jesus that Bruce discovered while playing the part of Jesus in ""The Gospel According to Matthew"" videos. This book is a life-transforming experience for the reader! I had to read it again as soon as I finished the first reading. I also had to get the videos! They and the book have already touched the lives of my family and friends, and I've used bits from both in my preaching at church. This book will bring you blessings many times over!"
5,This is one of the greatest books ever written.,"The author really knows how it feels to be in the footstep of Jesus Christ..! It so touching, as if God gaves him a glimpse of His feelings towards His Creations, us.., human..!"
2,Not Tough Enough,"Have a Golden Retriever and within 15 minutes he had seperated the ball, rope, and plush toy. Within two days he had ripped one of the corners off and we had to take it away. There is nothing ""Extreme"" about this product."
4,Very Intense,Sigourney Weaver gives a solid performance here but it's Harry Connick that steals the show.he palys his role very well.in fact it's Arguably his best Role ever.very creepy&intense.
5,Flat,"This movie is one of my favorites, but what I realy like is the apartment. I wish I could have a place like that."
5,Craved a BD copy for a long time ...,"Copycat is definitely one of my favorite films (other reviewers have put forth all its virtues). I have watched it multiple times, but put off getting a Blu-ray copy because of Hi Def Digest's poor review of same. Finally decided to get one since my standard DVD copy looks rather inferior on the Samsung 71"" digital set and I needed a ""Copycat"" fix !The BD copy looks great and I look forward to my next fix. As usual, Amazon's price is good, too."
4,I recommend this movie,"she's a criminal psychologist, he's a copycat to many crimes, one she was in, it's a good movie, that's all I can say about it"
4,"Intelligent, inventive serial killer thriller","A smart, scary, grown-up serial killer thriller. Enhanced by some very good acting,-- especially by Sigourney Weaver -- some very sharp writing, and director Jon Amiel'sskillful modulations of the ups and downs of tension and emotion.That said, the film's strengths are slightly undermined by a few annoying contrivancesin keys spots, a few awkward moments, and an ending that doesn't quite work.But this is still still way better and meatier than most of it's genre."
4,A gripping thriller,"The story involves two serial killers and the detectives Mary Jane Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Getz (Dermot Mulroney) who bring them to justice with the help of a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver). The problem is that before the first killer Daryll Lee Callum is caught, he torments, terrifies and nearly kills Dr Hunter. As a result, Hunter is agoraphobic and, unsurprisingly, a bit neurotic. This makes her an unreliable expert in the eyes of the police captain. Callum is subsequently caught and torments Hunter further from jail, but now another psychopath has entered the picture using methods of previous serial killers for his own MO. The film is very tense, the plot feasible and the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, excellent. The film was directed by Jon Amiel and the incidental music composed by Christopher Young."
3,"""I am Death and Life""","Copycat sheds light on a serial killer who imitates other known serial killers in an effort to gain fame and immortality.The acting and the dialogues are rather weak with the exception of Sigourney Weaver who does a good job of trying to cover up for the rest who really do disappoint with their performances, especially Holly Hunter who is much more like a schoolteacher than a police detective. On the other hand the plot and the setting are actually very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers had made more of an effort.Overall, far from being a masterpiece, Copycat will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.If you're in the mood for some AMAZING thrillers, check out Resurrection, The Bone Collector, Seven, and of course The Silence of the Lambs."
1,Copycat (keep case packaging),"The meaning of ""keep case packaging"" is that there are English subtitles and you cannot get ride of them to watch the movie. What a bummer...and what a waste of time and money. Had I known this I would have never ordered it. It's also unfortunate because I have seen this movie before and it one of my favorite psychological thrillers. Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver and other actors are excellent. If you like real thrillers...this movie is fantastic."
5,Copycat,Excellent packaging and quick. Thanx so much and I will use you whenever possible. Copycat is one of my favorite moves.
4,Entertaining thriller,"Copycat can't be seen for any originality (no sarcasm intended), but it was a really entertaining experience. I remember watching it when I was a teen. Wow, time sure flies! (You'll see it when the computers are shown!)This one could use a good remake."
4,"""Copycat""","If you are interested in serial killers and FBI profiling, this is a must for you. If you're not, watch it so you can learn how fascinating this study of the sociopathic mind really is. Sigourney Weaver sheds her ""Ripley"" persona as the target of ""copycat"" killers due to her expertise in their behavior. After an attempt is made on her life, she becomes agoraphobic although willing to assist the police in locating the killer.Holly Hunter is effective as the detective who is determined to draw her out and put an end to the brutal killings that are following the modus operandi of infamous killers - Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Albert deSalvo (the Boston Strangler),"
2,"Counterfeit ""Silence of the Lambs""","This is an exploitation movie, pure and simple, professionally done. What is being exploited is the public's fear and fascination with psychopathic serial killers. Sigourney Weaver plays a shrink, who is an expert on the species, gone slightly bananas with fear. We have the usual tinkling music to warn us that evil is afoot, the targeted woman alone in her apartment, the investigating cops one step behind, and of course the mad man-or actually mad men: as in ""Silence of the Lambs"" there are two of them, one in jail and one out.Why anybody would want to make such a movie is beyond me. Money doesn't really explain it. I think the desire to show others that you can exploit the public better than they can is the motivation.Holly Hunter plays a homicide detective in a pony tail. She's cute."
4,A good thriller.,"Serial killer expert Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) lives isolated in her apartment after being the victim of a murder attempt. When a new killer wreaks havoc in San Francisco, the police contact her for help. They soon figure out that the killer is copying old, famous murders. In order to catch the killer, and avoid becoming his victims themselves, they have to try to figure out his next moves.It's a good thriller with some quite chilling scenes. Sigourney Weaver is good as the traumatized Dr Hudson, and Holly Hunter is charming as always as the good cop. The supporting cast is good as well. If you like thrillers and haven't seen this movie, you've got two thrilling, entertaining hours to look forward to. And it may be worth watching more than once."
3,It's in t.v.,It is on t.v on nickelodeon at 8/7 c every day except Thursdays. On Thursday it is on at 9/8 c
1,Cannot recommend this scale,"I can step on the scale at different points in a day, and my weight varies plus/minus 10 pounds. No, I don't have an eating disorder.Stay away."
1,Junk - No precision and no accuracy,"On this scale, my weight fluctates all over the spectrum. For example, I wake up and weigh 155.0 lbs. 5 Minutes later, having changed nothing about myself or my clothing, I will weigh 157.00 pounds."
1,no 'weigh',I bought this scale on 11/3 because I wanted something highly readable. I weighed 5 pounds more on this scale than my previous one. By the next day I was 10 pounds heavier. I packed it up and took it back. It is truly a piece of crap.
1,Price says it all,"This scale is cheap and is a bad product, so I got what I paid for. It changes its mind about what it displays with every reading, even the ones done within 2 seconds of one another. Bad buy!"
2,ok,"I thought this cd was ok, I've heard better but, it is only a tribute to Gene. Most songs are originals about Gene Vincent. My favorite song has to be Pretty Pearly. The artist is truly talented. If you are truly looking for Gene's music I would recommend ""Crazy Times"" or a greatest hits."
5,Bravo! A marvelous read!,"I truly enjoyed reading this adventurous story of love and societal observation. I was moved by the author's quest to understand the incredible differences that can exist in a country which is virtually a stone's throw from the land of opportunity. She wonderfully conveyed how the Cuban people are able to find beauty and humor under trying circumstances. It is a tale that captures a peoples' passion for life in a delightful, sometimes surprising way.In short, it is moving and thought-provoking - a book well worth reading!"
5,It's like being there!,"Having just returned from a two week mission trip to Cuba, I felt as if I knew the island fairly well because we'd stayed in a small community. However, after reading this book I now know how much more there is to everyday life in a place that struggles for some of the everyday things that we take for granted. It's a great story of an intercultural relationship and the challenges that go with it as well as a ""slice of life"" of living in Cuba. This book will open your eyes to what life is like among highly educated people who still live under somewhat third-world conditions. I highly recommend it if you're interested in Cuba at all."
3,"Unwittingly condescending in places, but mostly thoughtful","The author captures a lot of Cuban life really well. However, I wonder why she fell in love - the narrative seems to be all preoccupied about how el novio will be unable to cope with the Yuma (is the reader to assume that she coping perfectly with Cuba, given that she was an 'experienced traveler?') So, it comes off reading like a very unbalanced, even condescending, relationship (in which A. only has two descriptions - the brownness of his skin - ok already! - and a green outfit). That's sort of unsettling. Otherwise, fluid read."
4,A Life Between Two Shores,"I picked this book for our book club after reading a review in the Pomona College Magazine. We live and work in Claremont and wanted to support a local graduate.We all enjoyed the book and it led to a lively discussion on politics, third world values and love bridging two cultures. We all would like to know the next chapter. A good and interesting read to stimulate your mind."
1,Sleep Walking Through Cuba,"I have lived in and travelled to Cuba several times over the past 45 years. The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac. She must be dead from the neck up.In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed. The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned. How fitting.I couldn't bear reading past the first 100 pages. The crime is that trees were cut down to print this drivel."
1,Solvent Gun Review,"I purchased 2 of these solvent guns several years ago and they worked great but have corroded and fell apart since made of aluminum and brass. The new solvent guns are more expensive, just as cheaply made, and don't work near as well as the originals made by the same company.. Don't waste your money!! The best solvent gun is made by Snap On ( Bluepoint ). It is more expensive but what's the point of saving money on a product that doesn't work!! It's like buying a pair of glasses on sale but not your prescription!! I also bought a solvent gun on eBay for $8 and it has performed excellent."
2,Marginal performance,The hose included with the spray gun is a joke - it is extremely lightweight and comes complete with kinks that don't smooth out and which cut off the flow of whatever cleaning solvent is being used. Requires replacement with a more substantial hose immediately. The gun draws cleaning solvent poorly and therefor fails to provide a substantial enough spray to effectively clean oily or greasy parts. Disappointing product overall.
4,Not bad for the price,Does the job. Do yourself a favor and toss the stock hose. Buy a thicker gauge from your nearest hardware store. Make sure your compressor can supply enough CFM. This is an guzzler!
1,it look ok.but,"it look good, but dont even work at all, it is waste of time and money for the junk. unless"
1,Quit working after only a few uses,"Feed tube needs to be stiffer, it collapses on itself and stops the flow.Need to un-kink it every so often. Other than that, it works great.Edited opinion after more use. Quit working after a few uses (5) because ofcorrosion. Not a good product. Good packaging and fast shipping."
4,"true punk genius, outside of modern influence.","justin, vern and brandt were incredible in this period. learn to understand true musical genius through this album. then, move on to their others. sara only added to their sound after brandt.the later albums build on this dynamic, but true structure arises from foundations.buy this, buy the others. you won't regret anything."
5,Mark's Story of Jesus,"Excellent resource material. I enjoyed it so much I have sent it as a gift to others. A practical resource for any Christian, nondenominational, Roman Catholic, Orthodox , or Protestant or anyone doing historical research."
5,Still Love This Album As If It Were Brand New To My Ears,I love Holly. Justin Nozuka definitely brings something to the table. I remember the first time I heard After Tonight. It was in the morning while I was preparing for work and he was one of the Fresh New Artist on VH1. I immediately fell in love with the song. Did a little research on him. Check out more songs from the album on Myspace and it has been heaven ever since. I loved every song on the album and I couldn't wait to spread the word about this new and highly talented musician/artist. Everyone I shared his music with loved it. I am really looking forward to this years release of You I Wind Land And Sea.
3,One fantastic song,"The song ""After Tonight"" was the reason I bought the CD and it is a fantastic song. The rest of the CD is okay, the pace of the other songs is fairly consistent but without the energy of the standout tune. This band should seek more up-tempo opportunities."
4,refreshingly different,as a debut album it was't bad for this young canadian. you can tell that he has some jazz and soul influences
5,Good chill music,I had first heard of Justin about a month ago and love his music right away. Order the CD and like to play it in the garage while I'm working on stuff.
3,'The Shetland Bus' vs 'We Die Alone',"Howarth's 'Shetland Bus' was interesting but not gripping. As compared to Howarth's 'We Die Alone'. I could not put down 'We Die Alone', it was a compelling story of human strength, human nature, and love for freedom. I could feel the cold wind, ice, snow, hunger... Wow, what a story. A must read for all to understand what the fighters who go to war may have to endure. Being a veteran of war, I think that many people do not have an understanding of the sacrifices and perhaps the ultimate sacrifice veterans make. A must read."
5,1940-1945 German occupation of Norway,"Howarth tells the story that reminds me of the Underground Railroad and Harriet Tubman.Only these were Norwegian seaman and fisherman using their small boats to constantly sail from Shetland Iles to Norway, while trying to avoid the watchful eye of the Germans, to land weapons and supplies and to rescue refugees during the occupation of Norway.Many of the places Howarth speaks of can be seen today on the internet along with the mention that they were all very much aware of the Shetland Bus.Another vivid journey is Howarth's ""Dawn of D-Day""."
2,This isn't hip hop--it's break dancing :(,"I was very disappointed with this video. I had hoped, based on other reviews and the factory blurb, that this would help me dance like good dancers in hip hop clubs. Well, that is not what it teaches.If you want to learn to break dance and fling yourself on the floor and spin around, then buy this video--after all, he is a good instructor. But if you want true club or music video HIP HOP dancing, look elsewhere.Additionally, women (like me) probably wouldn't find this video helpful because the moves are very butch."
4,as described by reviewers,"I bought this for my teenaged sons. They haven't watched it yet, but I have, and found it to be well done. I think they will enjoy it. The reviews I read helped me to pick this product and I was pleased with the selection."
3,This review is dedicated to my girlfriend . . .,"Honey, at last I've found the video for us. I have been trying very hard to learn to dance for you and I think now I can know how. You will not need to go dance with other guys any more. I can dance! I mean it! Just please watch me go sometime with the Fuzion video. I am ready to spice up our lives."
1,Don't always believe what you read.,"This book is a sad compilation of environmental propaganda. To speak of timber harvests in the ""billions"" of board feet when the industry is vertially extinct is just wrong. The Tongass region is the home of thousands of hardworking, resource-based individuals who don't want their lives to be misportrayed as this book has done. Alaskans have managed the resources of the state responsibly and the author does an injustice by not honestly explaining this fact."
5,Here`s a review in English!,"I first came into contact with ANIMAL when my russian/costarican friend played the song LOCO PRO for me. I was impressed, and went to buy the album, only to find none of the other songs are like LOCO PRO. I read around and it turns out the song LOCO PRO is a mockery of an average rap song, but becuase I can`t understand any spanish I naively assumed that it was genuine music and not a parody. Oops. The album is quite good though, no wait, the album is very good, but it`s not my style at all, (Relentless hardrock makes me edgy, I`m more of a beatnick) but if you like metallica (old metallica) you will love this band because I can objectively say these guys are the best hardcore rock band out there. If your like me and think rock means The Beatles then you`ll be able to apreciate this, but I don`t know if you`d enjoy it."
3,Poder Latino with Power,"Great come back of Mr. Gimenez, Poder Latino is a powerful music album, their lyrics are very truthly and cruelty. 3 star for this album. Marcelo Corvalan (bass) are greater than the last one, and Andres Vilanova (drums), is a powerful drummer. The band style is better this time, with best rymthms, best riffs and the powerful voces of Anders Gimenez. Of course all the drums are made by Jimmy DeGrasso (ex-Megadeth)and additional musician as Robert Trujillo (Bass) on Deja De Ser, the producer of this album is Max Cavalera (ex-Sepultura, Soulfly) and Richard Kaplan.Well, at a nice price, you will enjoy great music... of course!"
3,very odd order,"I don't understand why this compilation is in this order. it would make a lot more sense, and would be a more interesting listen, if the songs were in chronological order. I agree with the other reviewer, there are some strange choices on this album. Even stranger is the total lack of selections from the album ""The King"" which, in my opinion, is one of the funniest releases in indie rock history. They definately weren't hits, but it's an important part of the bands' history. Also, only one song from ""A Catholic Education"" is just not fair for the fans. If you're already a fan of Teenage Fanclub then don't bother with this one. Spend the money on ""Deep Fried Fanclub"" instead.THROW IT DOWN BIG MAN! THROW IT DOWN!!"
4,"Whoa, Fannies!","Wow, a Fannies best of, there's a mouthwatreing prospect.This album is soooo close to being a 5*, but thanks to e few exclusions (the concept, the cabbage, Kylie's got a crush etc.), and the inclusion of a few dreary new tunes it stays at 4 (though a high 4). Anyone who has or has thought of TFC before HAS to buy this album. Simply the best songs you'll ever hear on one CD (though it's also available in a 2 disk set to allow full track length).Again, any fan of Big Star, Byrds, Nirvana etc. must by this album. TFC are one of the top 5 bands of the past 10 years, and it's still one of the best albums you'll ever hear, ever. What more do you need to know. BUY IT NOW."
5,TFC best of compilation cd,"What? No Alcoholiday?!Still a great collectionThe odd edited track from Howdy! but I think this is a good place to begin for the bandTheir best remains Bandwagonesque, so maybe pick that up. All of their albums are worth checking out, although Man Made (aside from the opening track Its all in my mind) hasn't really grabbed meA superb band, and a superb compilation. Well worth checking out! And the new songs (particularly ""Empty Space"") are fantastic as wellI understand they're still recording, which can only be a good thing. Irresistible pop, really. Check out ""I don't want control of you"", or ""Ain't That enough"" Or perhaps even ""Start Again"" (about divorce, apparently!)Real good band. VERY highly recommended"
1,A big mistake,"I purchased this for my three cats, as a way to deal with hairballs and add some vitamins to their diet. All of them are generally healthy, but this was recommended. I'm really sorry that I spent the money.I followed the instructions, adding a small amount to their food for two days. They did eat it; something that surprised me. Usually they don't like anything different with their food.By the middle of the second day all three of the kitties were spending the majority of their time sleeping and trying to find dark places to hide. They only do this when they are not feeling well.I stopped using the supplement and within another two days they were back to normal. My cats are not overly sensitive, but this product really affected them badly. I strongly suggest you use caution before adding this to your cat's diet."
3,Beyonce Dangerously In Love Is O.K...,"01. Crazy In Love Feat. Jay-Z (8/10)02. Naughty Girl (6/10)03. Baby Boy Feat. Sean Paul (6/10)04. Hip Hop Star Feat. Big Boi (2/10)05. Be With You (7/10)06.

Dangerously In Love 2 (4/10)13. Beyonce Interlude (0/0)14. Gift From Virgo (3/10)15. Daddy (7/10)So far, I'm not really into the CD. I'm not saying that this is a bad album, but I'm not really feeling Beyonce and her album."
2,Beyonce Cd Overrated,"Beyonce's album Dangerously in Love is by far an overrated cd. The only song that stands out is Baby Boy. The rest of the tracks on the cd have no depth and is only good for one thing, which is falling asleep. She may have a voice but does not use it to her potential.Do not purchase this cd...complete waste of money"
2,This album was truly over rated.,"First, don't get me wrong, because ""B"" certainly does have a smooth voice, but the writing was very bubble gum to me. Kelly's CD was by far much better than ""B's"", as far as writing skills, or the producer chosen to write for the album. I think the only reason she won those grammy's is because she's ""hot"" right now, and being beautiful seems to have it's advantages in the music business. But there were definately a lot more female artist who's albums surpassed ""B's."" Sorry ""B"", but I'm just calling it the way I hear it. Keeping it real! Try harder on the next one."
1,a bunch of bull!!!,"If your in to the ""love your man"" stuff this is for you,but, if your IQ is above 65 you deserve something better!!!!!! OOHHHH YEAAAH!!! I'm black, and I hate this stuff. This album is a RIPP!! HOLLA!!!!!"
1,"So Underwhelming, It's Unbelievable!","Beyonce may have shown a masterful touch crafting herself into an entertainment and endorsement brand unto herself, but she clearly lacks the fundamental talent to back it up, the substance underneath the stylish packaging. Radio hits ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" illustrate just how poor a vocalist she is without a talented producer, and the videos for these songs show her up as a far less talented dancer than her counterparts Britney, Christina, and Mya."
2,not impressed,I really did'nt care for the solo efforts of Miss. Knowles. I think Kelly Rowland has a much better voice. I only found two songs on the cd that I really enjoyed and I listened to the entire cd. She should stick with her group because in my opinion this was a waste of money. As much as cd's cost I expected more than two hits. She's no Alicia Keys. Right now Alicia Keys is the best thing going.
2,Not that Impressed,"I was really looking forward to this CD. But man was I not happy when I listened to the whole thing. I really like the 2 radio plays, ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"". But nothing else really sounded that great to me. I especially don't like the ""Me, Myself, and I"" cut, which is now on MTV. ""naughty girl"" got me intrigued with the intro, but killed itself with repetitive junk. I really wanted more from Beyonce'. I love her musical style, and her voice is fabulous. I just think she tried too hard with this one."
2,"Love Her, Hate This CD","I had been eagerly waiting for this album to be released forseveral months before it was out, but, damn girl! What is wrongwith you? I introduced Beyonce as a great talanted musician tomany of my friends who do not listen to English pop music, then....After this CD was out, It felt like a slap in the face to me!Crazy in Love and Baby Boy are nice, but....I can't tell thedifferences between the rest songs.....they are just the samehard to swallow featuring Beyonce's blather-like vocal expressions"
2,Only 2 good songs...,"""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" are the only 2 good songs on here, and even those two are way too overplayed and get old VERY fast. The other songs are just lame, middle-of-the-road junk. The song ""Naughty Girl"" does not really have vocals at all, more like whines. Songs like ""Hip Hop Star"" and ""That's how you like it"" are full of rappers making noises in the background. Most of the ballads are great songs if you are looking for the perfect song to fall asleep to. And most of the pop/R &B stuff like ""Be With you,"" ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Yes"" are somewhat catchy but can't compare to the likes of Mariah Carey or Aaliyah. ""Dangerously in Love"" sounds no different than the song of the same title on the Destiny's Child ""Survivor"" album. And the last song ""Daddy"" is a little eeky. Listen to it and you'll know what I mean. I really hope she goes back to Destiny's Child."
2,Alicia Keys/Jill Scott where are you???,"I bought the cd base on ""Crazy in Love"", and like everyone else says, there are only about 5 songs that are okay. But Alicia Keys is back Dec. 2 with her new album, Thank God!!! Alicia will end all of this Beyonce madness..."
4,I WISH I WROTE THAT SONG!,"NOW I THOUGHT BEYONCE WAS JUST A PRETTY FACE BUT THE GIRL HAS TALENT I LIKED DESTINY'S CHILD THOUGHT CRAZY IN LOVE HAD A CATCHY HOOK BUT I BECAME A FAN WHEN I HEARD ...ME, MYSELF & I! THE SONG IS TIMELESS ANYONE CAN RELATE TO THE CHORUS....I LOVE THIS SONG ALSO CHECK OUT YES, SIGNS,AND THE TITLE TRACK WITH THIS ALBUM BEYONCE HAS MADE A FAN OUT OF ME!"
1,Totally disappointed!!!!,"I didn't like this CD. The only good song on it was ""Crazy in Love!"" I don't think I will be buying another one of her cds for a long time."
1,The Worst,"The songs are way too ""commercial"" to me and just plain boring. I am not feeling this unoriginal, ordinary piece of garbage. She puts more into her image than into her music. This is crap. The best song is ""Naughty Girl"" and even that sounds like a remake of something from the seventies. Terrible album. Sorry."
2,Dangerously Annoying,"May I start out by saying that I loved ""Crazy In Love""? I loved ""Baby Boy."" And I love ""Me, Myself, and I."" And I love her latest release from this album, ""Naughty Girl.""However, my ""love"" for her songs quickly turn into ""loveD."" (emphasis on the ""D"") Her beats and rhythm are nice to listen to at first, but the listener quickly develops a bad case of earworm-- you just can't get her music out of your head all day!!! And the lyrics are absolutely TERRIBLE. Lyrics such as ""Capricorn Aquarius Pisces Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer oh! Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius I love all y'all"" make a listener cringe about her lack of songwriting ability. And her Beyonc'e interlude is a cheesy attmept to rhyme with her name: ""Your love goes beyond what I can say, love, Beyonc'e."" Her duet with Luther Vandross on the ""Closer I Get To You"" is a bit of a disappointment. It's good, but certainly not Grammy-worthy. Devout R&B fans may fall in love with this album, but it can quickly get tiring."
3,3.5 Stars,"This was a good solid album. It was very captivating in a sense that it kept me listening from beginning to end. The title stays true to form, since most of the songs are all about love and headache. Lots of collaborations--maybe too many. I understand that Ms. Knowels wanted to work with other talents on her debut album--but it kind of took away from what SHE had to offer. The spotlight shifted a little toward a few of her guest stars (Jay-Z, Sean Paul, ect) rather than doing HER much justice. I didn't buy the album to listen to OTHER hip hop artists.Another complaint--a few of the tracks sounded similar, which is common on any pop album I suppose. Beyonce also needs to tone her voice down a bit. She tends to get overly soulful and hits all kinds of crazy notes. Some may find it appealing. I find it rather annoying. But overall the album had a very smooth relaxing vibe. I prefer her slow r&b; tracks over the up beat hip-hop ones.My picks:Be With YouMe Myself and IYes3.5 out of 5 stars"
5,Beyonce is tha realist.,"This album was great. Live at Wembley was even greater. Beyonce's talent and style is unbelievable. I can't explain, you just have to buy it."
4,Good Debut,Beyonce is definately doing her thing on her debut CD. It has a lot of banging hip-hop songs as well as slow songs and she has a voice like no other. She is going to be around for a long time. I am already looking forward to her next CD. You go girl :)
3,mmm....very interesting.,"when i first heard this disc... it sounded alot like amanda perez's ""angel"" cd. alot of the songs are electronically mixed which is way to akward. im not saying this is a bad cd. i mean she has a lot of talent. some songs are swesome on this cd. hip hop star, yours, signs....lots. but sum are very weird soundingl but i kno this cd is going to multiplatinum. The lyrics are great. If you dont feel to confident about buying this cd. jus download mp3s of this song or sumthing. until u are for shure u luv this cd...dunt buy this cd."
5,I don't know what nathan listened too.,This CD was the bomb okay you just don't know good music. Beyonce did her thang. You go girl. I love Dangerously In Love. It is my favorite CD.
3,Dangerously In Love,I like the cd. The cd is ok.The songs are all alright. Especially the ones with Jay-Z in them.I love him so much and think his voice is just so.....I don't know.
1,She can't sing.,I'm sorry but Beyonce Knowles is a horrible singer. I am so sick of her. This cd was awful. I listened to a friends copy and she told me I could have it. I took the cd and sold it at a used cd store near my school. Her vocals are limited and this is an overly produced effort. Period point blank her singing sucks. Calling her a singer is an insult to all the talented singers out now.
1,worst ever,This is possibly the worst album ever recorded. I think dogs barking would be more appealing to my ears. If you really must have this trash just download it for free. She shouldn't make a dime on this crap.
3,It's not that Good,There are a few nice songs on this CD but otherwise it wasn't what I expected it to be..
4,Where is the song I wanted?,My boyfriend bought me this cd because I wanted that song Summertime f/ P.Diddy. It is a good song where me and my boyfriend listen to which is not in this cd. Every other song is good but the song I wanted is not there. What did they do to that song? Where is the Summertime song????
1,Awful!,"This is the most overrated piece of crap to come along in a really long time. This is basically an album full of fillers! There's nothing even remotely appealing about it. Believe me when I say, you'll be wasting your money if you buy this crappy excuse for an album!"
5,Best Solo,"Beyonce Knowles indefinitely is an amazing artist and is very zestful, in this CD there are definitely references made to her mysterious lover Jay Z, in the song signs. While listening to her CD it kind of threw me off because she begins to talk about being crazy in love and in the song me my self and I she begins to go into a depressed disposition and leak all of her personal idiosyncrasies. Overall I must say Cudos"
5,One Of My Favorite CD's,"Personally, I'd been getting a little tired of Beyoncemania. I hadn't any intentions on buying this cd. Not because I think she has a lack of talent, because she doesn't, but because I thought it was going to be basically be every Destiny's Child Cd mixed up in a blender and poured out. Then one night I was at my friend's house listening to it. I was pleasantly shocked to hear how good it was. That next morning, I was in line at Target buying it. And that was months ago. I listen to it almost every day. The highlights of this CD are Speechless, Dangerously In Love and Naughty Girl.If you haven't bought this CD yet, stop reading now and go out and get it!"
3,Could be better,"The first songs are very good!The overplayed Crazy in love.The sexy song Naughty girl.The smash hit Baby Boy (Ft Sean Paul)Hip Hop Star (Ft Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)Ecxept from that 4 songs, the other are ballads!!!Where are Beyonce sexy tracks!?Be with you, Signs are the best ballads, Me, myself & I (the third single is ok)But Beyonce shows that she needs a rapper to create a cool song!Where are the fast melodies!But her voice is amazing, so, that 4 tracks at first, be wiht you and signsShe deserves 3 stars! (her voice is the best and I love her)but I was waiting for more!"
4,Good First CD,"I bought Beyonce's cd after hearing baby boy, because i really liked that song, Crazy in Love was getting overplayed, and i wanted to hear another song, before i went and bought it. I really like the cd. Of course everyone likes Crazy In Love, but Naughty Girl is a good song, she took a couple of lines from Donna Summer for that one. Baby Boy is great, i like Sean Paul on the song. But my new fav. song is absolutely the title song. Dangerously in Love, it's a great love song, and she sings beautifully on it. I love the chorus, it's a feel good song. I like this Cd, way better than Mary J. Blige's new cd....."
4,Very good and chance taking album!,"I like Beyonce's album even more after about 11 months later. From ""Crazy In Love"", ""Baby Boy"" and ""Naughty Girl"", to the nine ballads that dominate the album, this is a solid effort from her. I like how ""I'd Rather"" and ""Me, Myself and I"" weave so well back to back. And the Missy Elliott-involved song about horoscope signs sounds very reflective. Most dramatic is ""Speechless"" and how Beyonce belts it out during those 6 minutes! Most emotional is the song she dedicates to her father, ""Daddy."" It has been worthy of the many awards it has received this past year. Fabulous singing, very musically done, this is a great album all throughout!"
4,JLO Touch!,"Dangerously in Love is a perfect Beyonce Knowles that makes a 'Feed Good' JLO Touch, of coz! If you love to watch JLO dancing on the floor, Beyonce is just 'Terrific' with her sways that makes you fall dangerously in love with her. Crazy in love, Baby Boy, Naughty girl are my three fav songs that I never miss to listen n watch. Beyonce has the talents and she reminds of Donna summer days with her song 'Naughty girl'. Her Baby Boy with Sean Paul is fairly a cool song but let me say Missy Elliot's never been my liking somehow with the Signs though the song is good. Be with you is a romantic song.Beyonce has a quivering vocal voice with a touch of feel in the heart that one can't resist her spell. Though not all songs great but for a collection, Dangerously in Love is definitely a Good Pick - 'Beyonce Knowles' for a great change and that's Destiny's child! Enjoy!"
3,Average Performance,"Overall, I think this album is just O.K. It definitely is not earth shattering. The one thing that really bothers me is the ""Be With You"" track. If you lisen closely to the rhythm of the meolody line, it is exactly the same as the song ""Freak Like Me"" by Adina Howard (1995) just performed more slowly.I am still happy nonetheless with Beyonce's success, and I hope nothing but the best for her."
2,Weak but sorta sleak,"She is better off alone for sure but what happened?There are the hits: ""crazy in love"" and ""work it out"" and of course ""baby boy"" (which never struck a nerve with me until the overly sexed up video), but this album is just desperate and forced. Songs like ""Signs (Feat. Missy Elliott)"" numerous other tracks on this album begin with interesting ideas and sounds but lack to keep the interest after 30 seconds. Lyrics are naive and silly and don't add up to the other incridients on the album."
1,Man Hell No,"Check, the only, only, ONLY, and I mean it, O N L Y, good thing about this whole cd is Jigga's verse on Crazy In Love. Not even Outkast's Big Boi was as good as I spected. Abnd Beyonce, god damn, her voice and lyrics just wack. ""I'm Foolish, I dont do this"", the hell we need another Ashanti for?"
3,"Not a prime candidate for a spot in the R&B Hall Of Fame, but at least she beats the crap out of Ashanti","For me, giving a good review to anything that's less than 10 years old can be difficult, because I do believe that today's popular music has already dug itself into an impossibly deep hole that it will never get out of, and while this album will not change that, it is nonetheless a fairly respectable album from a decent if not extraordinary entertainer. The hits ""Me, Myself & I"", ""Baby Boy"" and ""Crazy In Love"" were fun and catchy tunes that can be enjoyable nowadays since their days of being played out have subsided. Of course, the appeal of these songs and the album is diminished somewhat by the fact that some of them are sample-based, but overall, this album was definitely better than some of its directly competing counterparts at the time."
2,Great Voice...Not So Great Songs,"Aside from ""Crazy In Love"" ""Baby Boy"" and maybe a couple others, the songs on this album are no good. Although Beyonce has an amazing voice, the songs on this album don't show her vocal ability - I was very dissapointed with this album because I couldn't beleive how many tracks I had to skip because I just wasn't feeling it -"
4,~Amber's opinion~,"Well I dont have much to say about this cd, beside I LOVE THE SONG ''BABY BOY''!!!!! Beyonce is really talented and you put Sean Paul in the song....well yeah buddy!! I love the beat of this song! This is one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance:)"
4,Not what I Expected...,"This CD, unfortunately has a lot of slow songs, something i didn't expect from beyonce. Although the tracks do express how powerful her voice really is, I was hoping for more Upbeat tracks, like ""Naughty Girl"" and ""Baby Boy."" Baby Boy being one of the best tracks on the CD. I do find the song ""Signs"" featuring Missy Elliot, kind of strange, and pointless to say it's featuring Missy Elliot, because you hear nothing but two lines come out of Missy, no flow, no rhyme. The Best songs on the album are ""Thats how you Like it"" featuring Jay Z, this track is really good. And ""Dangerously Inlove 2"" which is the best ballad on the CD. All together, the cd is a good listen."
3,OVERRATED,"I bought this CD because I really liked Crazy In Love. I should have listened to the whole thing before I bought it. I only liked three songs and they are right at the beginning, though I do like the song called Daddy which pushed her rating up to three stars. She did do a lot of whispering which got to be annoying. It did not display the talent that I know she has got to have."
3,"Go back to Destiny's Child, PLEASE!!","The singles from 'Dangerously In Love' are all really good, but the truth is this is a CD made for the current mass market. The only real highlight is the incredible duet with soul legend Luther Vandross and that's because he's singing with her. Otherwise she's better off singing in Destiny's Child. I mean their first CD was *THE* R&B CD of 1998. I love that CD to death. P-LEASE release more Lauryn Hill-like R&B in the future or go back with Destiny's Child and do it. I knew when ""Writings"" came out she was going more pop but this is REDICULOUS! Why also does Missy have to sout on every track she produces? Not that shes a bad producer but she's not DJ Clue. Sorry Beyonce but this is no ""destiny's Child"" (their first album and their best). Get that album instead."
2,Not as Good As I Thought,"Beyonce has a strong voice. She can really sing. I think her lyrics are so corny and silly and sexually dumb.A lot of the music on the cd sounds like remakes.She has too many people featured on the cd.I personally don't like Baby Boy even though Sean Paul is hot right now! But then again, maybe it's the Video.I don't know what she plans to do when she returns to her group DC because she has change her image completely with the Solo cd.I think she cross over too far with the sexual, Floetry is the only artist in my opinion who can write that way but keep it creative and tasteful. Beyonce call Marsha and Natalie. They can give you pointers on songwriting."
1,Overrated...,It's not her fault pop music has become an industry of looks rather than talent.. .but she's certainly using it to her advantage.
2,2 .5 great songs the rest sucks,crazy in love great song - baby boy grat song - overplayed to death - yes - me myself and I ok song- beyonce? completely overrated - I mean extrmeley overrated - she is a good singer not great...this album has been completely overrated by the critics.
3,Try Again,"Beyonce can sing the hell out of an up-tempo song, but she does not have the voice to sing any mid-tempo tacks. She should dust herself off and try again."
3,Beyonce bounces!,"Beyonce Knowles's debut album isn't what I expected. From all the reviews I thought it'd be full of hits, but most of the songs are dull compared to breakout single ""Crazy in Love"". IN LOVE is an album ya should get if you're really into the R&B style of music - personally, I like more pop-oriented songs so Beyonce doesn't deliver with this album. It's done sterlingly production-wise! Buy this album if you're a huge Beyonce fan or if you like R&B."
2,horrible CD,"I love destiny's child and I love beyonce. She is a great talent, but this CD is crap and did not deserve any grammys. I wish they would have waited for her to release good music and awarded her for that instead. And I agree with a lot of you that Damita Jo is much better. Beyonce may be a better vocalist, but I'd rather have better sounding music with sweet vocals and honesty from janet instead of this pop trash I didn't expect from someone like beyonce. And janet is a legend, beyonce could be too if she released the right music. Maybe next time."
4,Outstanding Solo Project,"Beyonce is a talented young women and her first solo CD is really good. I enjoy more than three songs on this CD and the duet with Luther Vandross is the BOMB! With modern day technology and everyone being able to download or listen to music on the internet for free, Beyonce is obviously doing something right because she has sold MILLIONS of Dangerously in Love and has been in the top 10-20 for WEEKS...so I say let the record sales speak for themselves. Congratulations Beyonce, on your 5 grammy win...you have worked really hard and you deserve every bit of it!"
3,Pretty Good Effort,"I have never been a fan of Beyonce Knowles', but I have to say that her solo debut, ""Dangerously In Love"" is pretty good. Beyonce has the ability to show off her writing skills although I wasn't very thrilled with all of the songs on the CD.Stand-out tracks:Me, Myself, and IThe Closer I Get To You (duet with Luther Vandross)Most of the other songs on the CD just fall into the same old R&B/pop category. While her first single ""Crazy In Love"" definitely gets you up dancing, many of the other dance tracks seem somewhat forced. All in all I would say this is a pretty good effort."
5,"Beyonce, you really put 110% into this one","This album was great! Better than I had expected. I could listen to it time and time again.1) Crazy in Love~ 5/52) Naughty Girl~ 5/53) Baby Boy~ 5/54) HIp HOp Star~ 3/55) Be WIth You~ 5/56) Me, Myself and I~ 4/57)Yes~ 4and a half/58) Signs~ 3/59) Speechless~5/510) That's How you like it~ 5/511) The closer I get to you~ 4/512)Dangerously in Love PArt 2~ 4/513) Beyonce Interlude (very pretty) 5/514) Gift From Virgo~ 3/515) (bonus track) Daddy~ 5/5There you have it. Congrats B!!!"
3,Its OK,Form Crazy in love to Naughty Girl where beyonce prove that she is a pro when it comes to perform. The rest of the album is not that impressive. I think that Beyonce could have done better because she is capable of doing better. This record was concentrate more in a advertisement process putting doing a track with sean paul that becomes annoying after hearing it a couple of times. Most of the concentration an the album was put on crazy in love which was the song of the summer. Besides that beyonce needs to start putting her real talent without this beau go crap that we all like to call advertising !!!
5,Impressive!!!,Wow! Beyonce. I love this Cd. All the tracks are great. You got alittle of slow jam and fast beats! I recommend that you buy because it's worth your money! I personaly think she needs to do another solo album.
4,appearance is nothing; music is all,"My title is true. I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Highlights of this disk include ""crazy in love"" ""naughty girl"" ""yes"" ""baby boy"" and ""daddy"". Even worthy of a Grammy or two. True R/B........"
2,People download the songs i write only,"I mean seriously i love beyonce, when people say shes fat and stuff im like ""no shes not shes beautiful"". But seriously this album stinks, do not waste your money. The only people that will like it would be little teeny bopper girls.The songs you should download are:1. Crazy in love - if you dont have it already2. Baby boy - if you dont have it already3. Be with you4. Thats how you like it - can get annoying but her verses are good, and the rap just finsihes it off, if you can crop the song from the beginning and end and make it like 2 minutes long, its pretty good.5. Bonnie and Clyde - again if you dont have it already6. Me Myself and I"
2,Image,"I think Beyonce is famous for three reasons:1. She was in Destiny's Child.2. Her image.3. She has OKAY songs.Not very good reasons, if you ask me. I doubt she can hold a note like Christina Aguilera or Avril Lavigne, and I really doubt she writes her own lyrics. Reason number 2 is definately the top reason so many people like Beyonce. I'm one of few who isn't into this whole cheesy rap and R&B; music hitting record store shelves. ""Crazy In Love"" is a good song, but I wouldn't waste my allowance money on this CD. I advise you to do the same.(...)"
3,First Three are Great,"The first three songs on this cd are great, but after that its like... Zzzzzz Zzzzzzz Zzzzzzz! They all sounded pretty much the same to me. But it was worth the buy I guess for the first 3 which are all hits."
5,My Review,"I think the CD is great. The only songs I don't like are Hip-Hop Star and Gift from Virgo. Other than that, I could listen to the CD all the way through."
3,I love Beyonce but it is way too much!,"Beyonce is a sexy,beautiful,lovely,and wonderful singer and actress.And I love this album.My mom bought this album for me.Cause before Mom got this album for me,I wanted it.So I got it.Beyonce has a nice voice.And Mathew(Beyonce's dad),picked the right lead singer for Destiny's Child.The front cover of the CD looks very nasty and Beyonce is wearing like a diamond poncho with nothing under it.Girl,Put some clothes on!!!That is 1 star minus.And another reason is that her nipples would be showing.But it did not.But I love this CD.I love the booty-popping hit,Crazy In Love,stomach-shaking,Naughty Girl,reggae-style,Baby Boy,Hip Hop Star,Be With You,Me,Myself and I,Signs,That's How You Like It,and Dangerously In Love 2.I love this but she should have never wore that cause it looks nasty and trashy."
1,Dangerously thinking of burning this cd,"I don't like this record. The first single was a promise but the album really really disappointed me. Fortunately I didn't buy it, a friend of mine gave it to me and he didn't like it too (I guess he liked only the girl, *lol*). All the songs are slow and soooo boring, they never change. When I put this cd on the player I feel like I wanna skeep EVERYTHING! The only songs I would save are the singles (Crazy in Love which I LOVE, Baby Boy, Nasty Girl) and maybe Hip Hop Star. It's not so good but has got a good ""hip hoppy"" rhythm, which I really like. If you don't wanna feel disappointed like me don't buy this album! Of course if u don't love slowtempo r&b songs...if u expect upbeat songs, better to buy Destiny's Child!!"
3,good album,"love the songs:Signs,Crazy In Love, Dangerously In Love and the Last trackGood duet with Luther ""the closer I get to you""good buy!"
1,Chi Lites Sample,"""Crazy In Love"" was sampled from The Chi Lites ""Are You My Woman?"" that came out in 1969. Beyonce is one of the few young artists out there who can actually sing. On this album she definetly reveals that she does not have a style of her own that anyone can mimic.Instead of taking a chance of doing something different, Beyonce just goes with the flow. All of the songs sound like the rest of the [stuff] you hear on the radio: cheesy, [weak], and mass produced.... Beyonce- you can do better than this."
2,This is not a timeless album!,"It's a good cd, but it's not great. Beyonce said she wanted to make a timeless album, I'm sorry but this is not it. I think the vocals are good but not great. She didn't blow me away, this album will not get played very long because you get tired of the songs."
3,Good,"It has the two popular songs other than she can probably milk out one more hit song from it if she advertises it as much as the other songs. I didn't like baby boy right of the bat, but after hearing so much I like it. I don't like some of the songs, but they are still decent songs, but I don't know if it is because I expected the CD to be as good as the ones of Destiny Child. Maybe I will like it when i hear them a million times on the radio, and on T.V., but so far i just like 3 songs Crazy in Love, Baby Boy, and me, myself and I."
2,An Album To Listen To In-Store But Not To Buy (Not great!),"When I first heard Beyonce was doing a solo album I thought ""Cool it should be cool"" so I bought it a couple of weeks after it was released and when I heard it I went half way through the songs and changed it to ""Crazy In Love"" The only good tracks on this album are ""Crazy In Love"",""Thats How You Like It"" and ""'03 Bonnie And Clyde**"" There arent good songs on this album only 3 or 4 but they dont stand out I cant really imagine most of these being singles because the songs arent good.Gosh Even ""Baby Boy(Featuring Sean Paul"" Isnt good Seans voice just annoys the crap out of me and the up-beat song with Beyonce's sleepy voice isnt really great 4 me.I think the world is fussing alot over Beyonce because she is beautiful and thats it.I say this is an album to listen to but not to buy unless you are one of those Beyonce-Fussers."
4,Pretty Good,"When I first bought and listened to the album..I was kind of disappointed, but it has grown on me and I really appreciate Beyonce's talent. I was a bit surprised with the sensual lyrics, but I guess it shows who she is as an artist away from Destiny's Child. I think that Speechless, Naughty girl, Rock Star, and Be With You are the best! I think her voice sounds so wonderful."
2,Almost a total waste,"I was not impressed with Beyonce's c.d. I purchased her and Monica's at the same time, and Monica's c.d. gets alot more play in my car. Lyrically, it is a sad c.d. A 5 year old could've written most of the songs. She's a great performer, and the ballads are great, but overall, it's too ""britney spears"" for me. Nice effort Beyonce.....Maybe the follow up will be better."
2,Not what I expected.....,"This cd was not what I expected. I knew it was going to be different because she didn't want it to be another DC record but this cd was not all that good. Beyonce has a great voice but this cd was all over the place. There are a couple bright spots on the cd but not many. I think she should have not remade the closer I get to you. Please leave that to Donny & Roberta Flack, I was so disappointed in that remake. If you have not purchased this CD yet, Please listen to me and do not. If you really want it for your collection buy it used because its not worth the full retail price. Trust me I was disappointed and wished I didn't buy it. I recommend the Kelly Rowland CD instead of the Beyonce cd."
2,Don't Listen To The Hype,"From the moment I bought this album I was VERY dissapointed in it, I listend to the whole cd once and that was more then enough for me. Beyonce is an incredibly beautiful yet talented woman who can sing very well, yet the songs were BLAH. Their so boring and DULL ""Yes"" is the coolest track yet still boring,in BABY BOY you can tell her and Sean Paul have no chemistry. You want a good cd check out Monica After the Storm, its great, or even better a woman who can actually sing and hit every single note known to man and not known, Mariah Carey Charmbracelet. Peace"
1,Poor Debut!,"I am thoroughly disappointed by Beyonce's debut album. The songs tend to give me a headache, as she is screaming through them all. Some of the songs have a great beat to them, but there seems to be too much going on i.e. too many sounds and beats mixed together. I would have preferred for her to simplify the songs a bit. I think she has great potential, but this album is not worth the purchase."
1,So Average it hurts,"If, as some of the people who've written reviews for this CD claim, they're true music aficianados, they wouldn't be gushing all over this CD like it's the second coming. News flash: it's not even the 9000th coming, OK? It's AVERAGE, that's all. She's AVERAGE. And hopefully, someone will take her place as flavor of the month soon. REAL soon. What's real interesting is that the same people drooling over this CD like it was honestly something special will be writing the same kind of reviews for whoever the next big hype is. If you feel you MUST have this record, like someone else said, wait a while and pick it up in the discount bins.... because it's DEFINITELY gonna end up there."
1,dangerously overrated,"i can't believe this album got 5 grammys!,she had good choices for singles but this album is so generic.its no different from what ashanti,or aaliyah would have done.i tried to keep a open mind about this album because i don't wan't to becaome a up tight music critic.but theres nothing special about it.....none what so ever.i think shes fine as hell,but i don't think shes fine enough for me to give this album 5 stars."
2,Why all the grammys??,"I was so disappointed to see this win so many awards. I've listened to this all the way through and there are only about three songs that I can say I really like (and one of them is NOT Crazy In Love) I really don't know what Beyonce was thinking here. She was really good with Destiny's Child (refer to The Writing's On The Wall for a good example) What happened?? I skip a lot of songs because their lyrics are too corny to me or I just dislike them. Download the good tracks, I wouldn't recommend buying this. I really like Beyonce, but this as a multiple grammy winning CD? Please, hardly."
1,Highly Overrated!!,"I've listened to this album several times and I can say with complete confidence that only 2 songs are decent: ""Crazy in Love"" & ""Baby Boy,"" both of which were released as singles. The rest of the album is crap filler and a waste of time! I think I would have had more respect for Beyonce if she had released a 2-track CD rather than a 15-track CD with 13 bad songs! I'm still shocked and somewhat offended that this album won 5 grammy awards when so many other albums are 100 times more deserving! I advise you not to waste your money on this highly mediocre album!!"
1,Beyonce?? No Way!!!,"This CD sucks!! Who told her that whining and screaming is singing? Jay-Z got the right beats on some songs. But, overall Beyonce CANNOT sing. She won awards because there wasn't any competition at the time. I guess any girl dancing like a naked go-go dancer would get one too!!"
2,Little substance,"Beyonce has a decent voice, however her vocal wobbling becomes tiresome on any track and this is something she does ad nausium on her solo debut album. The singles ""Crazy In Love"" ft. Jay-Z and ""Baby Boy"" featuring Sean Paul give the the impression that this is indeed a dance album. Wrong! With the exception of ""Naughty Girl"" the rest of the album is running on a laidback, but not necessarily better vibe. As of now she has shown nothing to warrant all the hype. I give her props for her stage engergy but this album is not my cup of tea. I have not picked it up in months and have no plans to pop it in my cd player again anytime soon."
2,.................,Ummm I dont think this CD is what all these people are making it out to be. I think she tried TOO hard to be different. The CD is growing on me but it still gets 2 stars.
5,The last reviewer is CRAZY,"This album is amazing and I still have this cd in my car after 4 months. No, not every song could be put on the radio, but what cd ever has that? If you like Beyonce, then you will love the album. Every song has her certain thang to her which is why her fans love her, and why everyone in the world will soon love her"
2,Buy the singles instead,"This CD disappointed me because I was expecting more high energy dance songs like the hits Crazy in Love & Baby Boy.However,after these songs on the CD, it winds down to a slow ballad tempo for all remaining songs - good for setting a romantic mood, or falling asleep to.If you're buying this CD because you like the hits on the radio, I would recommend buying the singles instead - wish I did!"
2,um...well...,"I wanted to give this album 2 and a half, but since that isnt possible, I only gave it 2.When I heard ""Crazy in love"" I knew the album had to be tight, boy was I wrong. THIS CD IS SO BORING! The only good songs on here are ""Crazy in love"", ""Baby boy"", ""Me, myself and I"" and ""Be with you"". This album has to many slow songs. I like slow songs, but the ones on Beyonce's album are boring.I have tried to listen to this album over and over to see if my mind would change, but it hasnt.THIS IS THE MOST OVERRATED CD OF THE YEAR!I am so glad i bought this cd on the street for $4, instead of paying $18 for it. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME B!"
2,B O R I N G,"Crazy In Love and Bonnie and Clyde were so promising. Seeing as Beyonce is also the member of Destiny's Child to be home to the group's strongest voice, it seems a little wrong that she doesn't think up of some better tunes than this.Baby Boy with Sean Paul is great along with the 2 aforementioned tracks but aside from that this bowl of conflakes is a load of tosh.Sorry Beyonce. Better luck next time eh?"
3,ok,Dangerously in love was a Destiny Child song. I think it was unfare of Beyonce to put it out to be just hers. She made her album to better than Kelley's cause she's the one that wants to be in the spotlight.And to tell the truth I think some of the songs on this album are from Destiny's Child.
3,dangerously predictable,"ok we all knew beyonce was gonna have a solo album.plus its exactly what i exspected it to sound like.the album does have good choices for singles.the album is ok but i think its estremly overrated,and doesn't warrent 5 grammys at all.but thats life i guess lol.if only black people can when ocars about as much as we when grammys but i digress.i also noticed that beyonce is a somewhat pure mainstream alternative to alicia keys,as keys is a high brow alternative to her. so its really comes down to taste and what side of the fence your on.i have had this album a few months now and i rarely listen to it,it just didn'tb keep me interested.but of course girls like it cause well its girly,but i just thought it was silly and corny."
3,3 1/2 Stars...Not Great But Better Than B'day,"I was very anxious about getting this album but it didn't meet up to all the hype it was getting. The best tracks are the ballads ""Speechless & ""The Closer I Get To You"", ""Crazy In Love"". It was nothing incredible but not a complete disappointment. She's alot better in the group with the material that's presented on the albums especially Destiny Fulfilled. Don't bother with B'day, it only has 10 tracks and doesn't pay to have an album that doesn't live up to the hype."
3,I love Beyonce but this ain't right!,"Beyonce is a sexy singer and adorable actress.I thought this album would go beyond my expectations and I expected more from Beyonce on this album.I love this CD but this is too much for me.In fact,the front cover of the album is so damn nasty.I thought Beyonce would stay the same way she used to be while singing with DC3.I really liked the way she did in the music video and song''Work It Out''(from the Austin Powers Goldmember soundtrack)and she really pulled it off.But how in hell did Me,Myself and I came out?That sounded like a boring ballad,but it was a nice ballad for teens and women.The worst part is that there are a lot of ballads in the CD.But I love this CD anyway.So go and get it!"
4,Beyonce-Dangerously In Love,"To be honest I've only listened to tracks 1-7.I think they are koooo!!!Beyonce's #1 album and her first solo-album is not quite good like I thought it would be.Mainly because some songs bored me to death.But the beggining makes you just wanna get up and dance!Then tracks 8-15 make you wanna weep you tears out.Beyonce has an awesome voice and she's really good at making videos!Her music is the bomb,especially ""Crazy In Love"".My favorite songs are:Crazy In Love,Baby Boy,Yes,Hip Hop Star,Be With You,Naughty Girl,Speechless,That's How You Like It,Dangerously In Love 2 and Gift From Vergo.I'm looking forwards to getting Beyonces next album also Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams and also Destiny's Child #1's.Overall this album gets 100/100 because of the cover art.It's really tight!"
2,"Sure she can sing, but what about the beat?","Beyonce can sing for sure. But, the beats are just ... blech.Her first single and first song on the album ""Crazy In Love"" is the only good song.I must say I'm disapointed in her.Her second single ""Baby Boy"" is stupid.Especially that Sean Paul is in it.You can't hear what he says.OK, back to Beyonce.Her 3rd single ""Me,Myself,and I"" is so boring.The 4th single ""Naughty Girl"" is boring, too.Who knows what her 5th single will be.Probably a boring one.Tip: Buy the single ""Crazy In Love."""
2,Dangerously Over-Exaggerated,"Okay, I downloaded all the tracks, and like so many....this CD is not what I expected. As usual, the only good songs were the ones released as singles (Crazy in Love, Babyboy, Me, Myself and I and Naughty Girl).....the rest are mostly fillers. Big surprise? No, I'm pretty sure the Sony record label had it all planned from the release day.With 10 slow songs......how could anyone stay awake? That is way too much. For a good R&B; CD, try Alicia Keys' ""Diary"", Toni Braxton's ""Secrets"" or Brandy's ""Full Moon"". That's what a good album should sound like."
3,Not bad but she can do way better!!,"I think Beyonce has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard and she's very talented but this cd is not as good as it could have been. The CD is good up until you get to track number 8, then the quality of the CD decreases. I love ""Crazy in Love"", ""Naughty girl"", ""Baby Boy"", ""Me, myself and I"", ""Be with you"", ""yes"" and ""Dangerously in love"". The rest of the songs are not that great, she could do better. I expected every track in the CD to be amazing but songs such as ""Hip hop star"" make you want to skip them. I would still recommend this CD. I believe Beyonce is capable of making an album where every song is a hit but she probably didn't take the time to make sure her CD was the best release of 2003."
2,A Little Less Than Average,"I'll get right to the point: Beyonce's CD has about four good songs, and the rest are filler tracks. ""Crazy In Love"", ""Naughty Girl"", ""Baby Boy"", and ""Hip Hop Star"". After the first four songs end, the CD just goes downhill, as it will bore you more than a PBS special about the chemical compounds of rocks. Even her great voice can't save those flat tracks."
1,"Overrated, Period.","How did Beyonce win 500 billion Grammys? How did her album go platinum 100 times? HOW???? I'm not dissing her fans or anything, but this CD-and Beyonce-is overrated. She was actually GOOD in Destiny's Child because Kelly Rowland has a good voice, and so does Michelle Williams. But when Beyonce went solo? Oh, puh-lease!!!! (...)"
1,Another lipsynching fool,"Beyonce...believe it or not, her name is not half as obnoxious as her image! She never sings live which should give you an idea of what this album is like. Every other song ""features"" a rapper which only serves to further crowd the cloned songs that now appear on the radio. Pass this over for Kelly's album , at least she has a voice, sings live and gets good rappers like Nelly."
1,Dangerous 2 listen to,"Everybody thought this cd would be real good because of the 1st single ""Crazy in Love"" with it's famous booty dance but after the booty dance is gone this cd is nothing but a BIG dangerous disappointment. A couple songs on the cd are alright, not very good but it wasn't bad enough that you had to skip them, which i did a lot because the cd is WHACK!! The song with the legendary Luther Vandross is a very good song she actually song real good. I thought this cd was going to be awesome but it wasn't, so don't waste your money buying the cd listen to it first online then if you like it buy it but if you have a musical taste like me you do what you gotta do. I personally think Monica's ""After the Storm"" cd was WAY better then Beyonce's cd so if you looking for a good cd this summer Monica is the right one, just look over this poor excuse for a cd."
1,Bring back Destiny's Child,"This disk is nothing but an ego fest. Destiny's Child was one of the few solid groups out there before Beyonce ""Diana Rossed"" out with this boring CD. Listen to ""The Writing's on the Wall"" and then listen to this CD. Can you notice the difference? Beyonce's a mediocre singer who needs dance tracks to support her vocals. Destiny's child really helped her in ways that become apparent now that she's solo. The bottom line is: she just isn't that damn charismatic. Yeah she's pretty but if she never took all her clothes off she wouldn't be as interesting to the public, now would she? I have no doubt in my mind that she'll be playing German discos ten years from now just like her idol Ms. Ross."
2,Just buy the singles,"If you heard the excellent singles and thought the album might provide some more, stop. After two stunning tracks 'Crazy in Love' and 'Naughty Girl', the album lurches through some forgettable collaborations and slushy, sentimental ballads. There is little to look forward to when the bits you already know are removed. 'Bonnie and Clyde 03', another single, is welcome partly because it heralds the end and a quick change of pace that helps forget the middle tracks.Perhaps it's naive to expect tracks like 'Crazy in Love' to fill the album, but it quickly steps down a gear and seems to stop trying. I'm glad I own the tracks that persuaded me to buy the album but would probably not buy it in hindsight. No danger of loving the rest."
1,1 good song...,"dangerously in love is honestly the only good song on the cd. i was very disappointed. let this be an example to the music industry of why people pirate music. beyonce' has talent, i just hope she shows it in her next cd. download dangerously in love off of ITUNES for .99 and pretend the rest of the cd is one of those AOL disc you get in the mail....stay away."
4,"Beyonce is Dangerously set for stardom, Believe it.","Dangerously in Love is a Smash debut from Beyonce. Its goes where it needs to go. Beyonce starts of with four fresh club hopping joints initially with 'Crazy In Love'. The song is truly and standout from the Cd and from every thing else out on the radio ""right now"". 'Naughty Girl' is an eclectic mix of grooves fit to make a sensual sexy song for ladies to sing on the dance floor. 'Be With You' is a great riding joint where Beyonce uses her keen sulrty vocals in the most clever way on the track also like so with 'signs', Beyonce exhibits much control and finese that makes you listen again and again. This CD is not what you expected, its not Destiny's Child, its Beyonce, and its hot as hell. Its slow its fast, its sad, its happy, its a complete cd. At 21, to be this good, is great. Beyonce still has room to grow, but this cd really shows the persistent growth of some one on their way to being a legend.She is a truly talented artist hype or no hype."
3,Another average cd,"There was nothing special about this CD if you like music. Yes there are catchy songs like Dangerously in Love, but nothing on this CD lives up to the potential of the voice of Beyonce Knowles. To sum up the CD in one word, utterly commercial, if that's what you like then bump this if not, get something else."
3,CD is well-named,"The in-CD posters of Beyonce are nice :) The first two times I listened, I wound up switching CDs, though. The first few songs are pretty tight, but after that I got tired of the theme. I know the title of the CD is 'Dangerously in Love' but I thought it was a bit TOO 'lovey-dovey.'Once I listened to the entire CD, I found the song with Luther to be good, and didn't care much for the 'Signs' song. Maybe the songs will grow on me if I hear them more."
4,Beyonce cd...1 word..GREAT!,"I've always been a DC fan..and when i heard beyonce was going to have a solo cd..i had to buy it! So it was no surprise i bought the cd the day it came out. My favorite songs on the cd..would have to be ""thats how you like it""w/ jay-z and ""baby boy"" w/ sean paul. they are great..and of course i love ""dangerously in love"" sure it was on dc's survivor cd..but hey..she wrote it and she's proud of it! overall the cd keeps the tempo up, it makes me wanna get up and dance!"
5,Great pop record,"This is a great debut album by a truly talented woman. The first four songs are wonderful, infectious pop with a touch of hip hop. Beyonce also exceeds while singing ballads, showing emotion and soul without resorting to the vocal acrobatics of people like Cristina Aguilera. She can sing R&B, she can rock, she can perform hip-hop. This is an album people from 12-55 can enjoy. If you''ve given up on today's Top 40, this is a record to renew hope. Get it today!!!"
2,garbage,"For once, i actually listened to the cd at the record store before i decided to buy. I was so thankful i did. One word describes this cd....WHACK! Its sad to see this cd is going to sell millions and millions only because its a big star like Beyonce. Nothing new here. Its a sleeper."
1,We Get It...,"You're in love with yourself. We're also aware of the fact that you are female. No need to invent new ways of proving it. Instead, go back into the studio and spend more time on your music and less time on your wardrobe.If you don't then in another five or so years, you will be an old, sad, cougar with something to prove just like Janet Jackson."
4,good enough to buy,"for me personal this cd is better than survivor..she has showed some skills and her voice is beatiful. the best song are signs *the best on the album* that's how you like is cute, baby boy is o.k. be wit you sounds to 70's to me and closer i get to you is good but overall it is a good cd to pop in your car or just to chill and listen to"
2,Come On Beyonce!,"Beyonce used to be in a great group called Destiny's Child. And she threw it out the window. Yes, Hilary Duff did that too. But there both stupid. When you have friends, you should keep them, and not throw them out the window. Well, enough about that, let's get back to the reviewing.crazy in love 5/5naughty girl 2/5baby boy 5/5 besthop hop star 1/5 worstbe with you 4/5me myself and i 4/5yes 3/5signs 4/5speechless 3/5that's how you like it 4/5the closer i get to you 4/5dangerously in love 5/5beyonce interlude 1/5 (bad interlude)gift from virgo 2/5daddy 3/5overall 2/5My recommendation is either burn it, or don't buy it and watch it go down the billboard charts.ListenersVery Strong VoiceYoure Cool Friends Might Have ItReturnersWay Too Slow SongsNot Any Good Songs (baby boy and crazy in love are actually pretty good)So take my advice or read others because it's the same review.I hope this helped."
1,Mike G doesn't know anything about Music,"To the reviewer Mike G, its Ok not to like certain bands or singers, since we all have a different ear for different forms of music. But to say Pink Floyd has no talent, and give Beyonce a 4 star rating is absurd. Beyonce can sing you say. So can a million other people just like her. None of the material is written by her, and you say Floyd was a mass marketing device. Take a look at Beyonce. Hmmmm...This music I have no taste for, and I dont like it, but I will say that her voice is OK, but for the rest of her music, ummmm...NO...and Lets see if Beyonce can stay on the Billboard 200 for 17yrs, thats 17yrs in a row!! Learn about music dude before you make comments, That Music Theroy class has your name on it."
1,Go back to Destiny's Child,I used to think Beyonce was a classy woman when she did that cd with Destiny's Child called The Writing's On The Wall. Now i think she went and slutted up her appearance as much as possible to sell cds. The photo of her on her solo cd looks like the coverbox of a porno movie. I don't think any of the hits off her new cd are remarkable at all. If the songs Crazy In Love and Baby Boy are supposedly the best songs on the cd then that's not saying much. Once again we have another example of an artist who used to be good as part of a group who went solo and came up with a big disappointment. Skip this one.
1,unoriginal as can be,"This is not music. Yes, Beyonce has a good voice and has broad range but this CD is nothing more than recycled R&B music that other people have already done, perhaps because at least half the songs are sampled. The lyrics are very basic and childish, and it is overproduced with the same beats as every other song out there. The songs aren't horrible; 'Crazy In Love' is pretty good......and that's about it. The one word I would use to describe this CD is unoriginal."
1,It's the worst album I've ever heard!,"This album really sucks. Beyonce herself has no talent at all. Her voice is really artificial and very horrible. The songs are even worse! The only slightly better song is Baby Boy, but it still isn't very good.I would actually give this record 0 stars. I have no idea why Beyonce won any Grammys at all."
1,5 grammys for this???,"This album is rubbish!!! She has a pretty voice, but songs like crazy in love, baby boy, naughty girl, hip hop star, lose my breath... JUST MARKETING! NO DEEP LYRICS! Even Ashanti is better! At least Ashanti's are deeper!!!The only thing i like is Jay-Z. He should make a collabo w/ ashanti."
1,"Tired, Tired, Tired!","This girl must be commended for her dedication and persistence as an artist. She consistently tries to achieve high quality work. Although she demonstrates talent as a performer, a sound image, and mass appeal, since this review is about her cd, it is necessary to review her musical talent. Despite the obvious attention to detail on behalf of this singer, and production staff, I find most of her singing uninspiring and boring. She uses the same old licks and her voice is just not a big deal. Perhaps she has potential to contribute more to her music. Maybe this cd is dull because everyone involved was holding back on the creativity, for fear the commercial appeal might not follow more original music. Modern Hip Hop and r&b was founded on a long and soulful tradition of varried singing styles and voices, inspired orchestration, and overall originality. This cd could have provided a refreshing and welcome addition to the genre. Frankly, it just doesn't deliver."
1,Pure CRAP !,"I bought this CD because I really liked ''Crazy In Love''...God what a mistake !!! There's only like 3 good tracks on this CD : ''Crazy In Love'' ''Bonnie And Clyde'' ''Work It''...the rest is pathetic ! And the hidden track ''Daddy'' oh my God this is so Nasty ! What was she thinking ??? Anyway, I'm really not happy with my purchase, I want my $$$ back ! There's another album comming in 2004...believe me I won't fall in the trap this time, I've learned my lesson...Buy Nelly Furtado or Sarah McLachlan's new CDs...now that's what I call MUSIC !"
1,"love beyonce, hate this album",you're just better off sticking to destiny's child instead of this CD that portrays her as a trashy whore singing medicore songs that would suit j lo's weak vocals instead of the mad talent she has but is hiding with this commercial pop crap she puts out
2,Don't believe the hype!,"i've heard the whole cd. there's only 2 songs i like. the cd is ok but not all that. she sings okay ... & still needs to strengthen her vocal skills especially at LIVE performances. i don't consider her a diva. she has the potential but, still has more to learn & grow up from. she used to be a classy beauty to me but,after watching baby boy .....what a waste of talent. how can one really listen to it when she looks like a wet dog feenin for that ugly beast, jay z. if lauryn hill & norah jones were able to get grammys w/o selling their a**es hanging out, beyonce got awhile & ways to go if she's expecting for such a thing to accomplish."
1,THAT ASHANTI WANNABE!!!!!!,Beyonce can sing but I think that she should've made a better cd..Her Arrangements are horrible I bet she just made that cd in minutes putting anything together take my advice if u wanna buy a cd buy Ashanti Chapter 2 now her cd holds it down for both fellas and da ladies
1,Miss All That...Is Truly Not..,"Even with Ashanti's not so tuned voice, it would be more worth while to buy her cd than to buy this Crap that Beyonce won a million awards for. (So Unfair to the singers who are actually Saying something with their music.) She seems to have no inspiration and is going along with the low of the degrading industry. She is merely another puppet of the industry and her talent shown more through Destiny's Child! That's Real! No Gimmicks! Peace. One."
3,It's what she's always wanted.,"This was all in the plan from the beginning. Matthew Knowles had one goal in common; to make sure his little girl reach the top. He surely didn't care about Kelly, Michelle or any of the other girls that left the group. This CD got so much promotion. What about Kelly and Michelle's CDs? There CD didn't even get promoted that well. They were good CD too. I think Beyonce and her father is one of the biggest phonies in the entertainment business. Like I said in the beginning; this was the plan from the start."
2,A waste of talent,"Beyonce is obviously talented. She has written and produced Destiny's Child's greatest hits and when the group had problems and was about to disappear, Beyonce kept it together. Of course she's hated: she's strong, beautiful, powerful and extremely TALENTED, with an amazing voice. But this album is just a confused mess, there are a few good tracks but they're not enough to make it a real good album.....it's very disappointing, she has the talent to make great music but I can't hear any talent on this album....I still love her though and hope she'll come back stronger than this."
4,It's about time!,"The album is hot! The song, ""Me, Myself and I"" is incredible! It has helped me through a tough time in my life. Each time I hear it, it feels like the first. It reminded me of the first time I heard """"Survivor"", I mean the lyrics, made me aware of inner strength I didn't realize I had. For that, I thank Ms Beyonce, you go girl...you put it down, once again. I wish her continued success, after all it's warranted, she's talented. And to think, people were comparing this chic to Ashanti! Pahleeeeessse!!!!!!!!!"
3,Surprisingly good,"I am going to make this short and sweet. First of all, I had NO intention of buying this album. We all like ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" is on fire, but my favorite song is #9 - ""Speechless"". This song is a masterpiece!!! And it has been on repeat in my car and in my home. This song is just simply breathtaking...It is very sexy and romantic. It leaves me speechless. I was surprised that Beyonce' could sing a song that i would absolutely love because I was not much of a fan."
3,Eh...,"This CD isn't all that great, there are a few decent songs on it:Crazy in LoveNaughty GirlBaby BoyMe, Myself, and IBut the rest of the CD didn't really cut it for me. She has a good voice and all but the songs just basically all sounded the same to me. I wish she had a bit more variety, than the CD would have been better. Maybe next time. I was also surprised to see some of the sexuality in this CD especially after I thought I remembered Beyonce trying to act a bit more virginal and bashing those who were too sexual in their work. Dunno, I could be mistaken. 3/5 stars for Beyonce."
3,Dangerously in Love,"Really wanted to give this a 3.5. I bought this disc with no expectations other than curiosity about whether she would go the ""neo-soul"" route as promised or the ""hip pop"" route of other new school r&b; divas. I thought that the songs could have been presented differently so that the album doesn't seem so uneven - like why were all of the up-tempo songs presented first then the slow to mid-tempos?Overall though, I like this cd but doubt that I'll be listening to it 2 years from now like I'll be listening to Alicia Keys' ""Diary"".My fav tracks are: CIL (although really sick of the song now and cannot listen to it, initially I thought it was a powerhouse debut single), NG (sample but still catchy), BB (great summer dance song, Sean Paul MAKES this song hot IMO. If he was not on it, it would have FLOPPED!), Hip Hop Star (very edgy), Be With You (I absoutely adore this song!) and MM"
5,Girls Grown Up!,"WOW is all I can say! This CD is fantastic, Beyonce is all grown up and this girl can *sang*! I'm very impressed. Songs 5 & 6 are my favorites & I predict her next big hits. And her duet with Luther Vandross is just beautiful! You go girl!"
3,Expected more,"I still love Beyonce and here admirable writing talents, but I was really unimpressed by Dangerously in Love. I was led on by Crazy in Love, but most of the rest of the CD doesn't follow. Maybe next one...or maybe I'll just wait for DC3 to reunite."
2,Only 5 good songs out of 15,"I expected a lot out of this CD but there's not much to it and is kind of boring. The good tracks are:1. Crazy In Love (featuring Jay-Z)... you all know this one, it's great. In danger of becoming overplayed, but it's great.2. Naughty Girl... I like the beat a lot and it's a cool song.3. Baby Boy (featuring Sean Paul)... probably the next single. A Middle-Eastern type of beat.4. Hip Hop Star (featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown)... A lot of people on here don't like this song but I love it! The chorus is the best part.11. The Closer I Get To You (featuring Luther Vandross)... I absolutely LOVE this song! It is so beautiful! Excellent job by both!So, if I were you, I'd just burn these 5 songs off the Internet or someone else's CD, because they're the only songs you'll need to hear, because the others aren't necessary."
1,VERY disappointed....,"I am just gonna make this review short and not very sweet unfortunately....The CD is a waste of money unless you feel like buying a album with one good song on it which is the first single ""Crazy in Love""...Honestly the rest of the CD is a joke. NONE of the songs are like or as good as ""Crazy in Love""I mean Beyonce has a powerful voice and all but the songs are just really bad..not too many catchy tunes and not really worth it..Nice try Beyonce!I reccommend Monica's ""After the Storm"" Album or the Not yet released Mya's ""MoodRing"" Album."
2,all the glitz&Hype can't hide average Material,for all the Hype&whatnot that comes with Beyonce the bottom line is that She just doesn't cut it as a legit Solo Artist.She has the Diana Ross Persona but the Mary Wilson Material&that doesn't equal a Legit Solo Career.Catchy Stuff&She Sings alright but She isn't close to where She must go to Being what the Hype will lead you to believe.She needs to take a cue from Her Group Mate Kelly Rowland: drop a Real Catchy first song.
5,good dance album,"Its Beyonce so what else needs to be said? That girl will get you moving. I put this album on when in the kitchen fixing dinner or cleaning up afterwards and the lively beats make the time spent speed by. If you're a Beyonce fan, this is a nice CD to add to your collection."
1,Radio has played one of the 2 good songs,Nothing but Destiny's Child with the other to band members out to lunch. While Beyonce hogs the camera.
2,Disappointed,This CD is way too sexual for my taste. I am disappointed that Beyonce sold out to the sexual trash that pervades the music industry these days. I will be selling this mess back to the record store this weekend.
4,"mixed reviews, I'll give it a 3.5","crazy in love, baby boy and naughty girl are the big dance numbers on this album and all 3 were huge hits in 2003 and 2004, but you won't find the rest of the album sounding like those 3 songs. The rest is full of ballads and mid tempo r&b; tracks, only 4 to 5 of which I truly enjoy including me myself & I, daddy, be with you, signs, speechless and of course dangerously in love, which originally appeared on the destiny's child survivor album.If you're a fan of beyonce, I guess you will enjoy this album a lot, but I prefer the B'day album so much more, I can listen to that from start to finish without getting bored, while with this CD I can't sit through the whole thing though the songs I do love are well done."
3,It's OKAY,"Beyonce is a good artist but I really believe that people and the entertainment industry have blown her OUT of porportion. One of the reasons why her solo album did well because boyfriend JAY-Z helped produced it. And everybody knows that when you watch a Destiny's Child video the only person you see the most of is her. There are 3 artists in the group, at least for right now. Word is that the Group is trying to kick out Michelle stating that she can't handle in the spotlight. Some people think it's because she fell on 106 & Park. But my thing is don't keep letting go of people in your group. This will be the 4th person to leave. Their just not leaving for nothing!!!! Seems like to me Mrs. Jay Z and Kelly wants the spotlight to themselves and Kelly probably would've left a long time ago if it wasn't for being adopted by Beyonce's family. Beyonce is WAY OVER-RATED!!! Think about it."
2,Pretty bad...,"Stale songs, bad beats, uninspired lyrics, and just an overall boring feeling. I used to like pop, until I discovered rock. Hearing instruments and lyrics that aren't always about love gives you alot more to appreciate than hearing somebody with a crooning voice singing love songs overtop of synthesizers and processed beats. I gotta admit, some songs are a little infectious though, Crazy In Love is good, Naughty Girl and Baby Boy are mediocre, but besides that this is pretty damn bad. For good pop musicians who write every song, play their instruments and cover many lyrical topics try: Maroon 5, Outkast, Good Charlotte or Blink-182."
5,Beyonce - A Solo Star,"Minutes after buying this cd, I took it home and listened to the entire cd, and ket me just say that Beyonce should strongly follow up this cd. The single ""Crazy In Love"" gives you a close look and her personal life. ""Baby Boy"" shows her sexual side. I also think that the single ""Me, Myself and I"" showed a more softer side to her. For the money, this cd is totally worth it. I hope that after Destiny's Child releases and tours for their upcoming cd, that Beyonce release a new solo cd. Trust me, I will buy it, if it anything like the first."
5,This is the hotness!,Girl you may be no Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears but you know how to keep it tight! You are one of my role models and good luck with Destiny's Child reunion. Teach them other girls lessons on how to sound bangin!!!
3,Slightly above average,"It's pretty good, but I expected more from her - especially with the strength of Crazy In Love. Not a disappointment, but close."
2,"Half & Half, Upbeat! and Boring!","Wow! if there is any way that I can describe this album to you is, the first 5 tracks are good!, the rest it's just boring!, and what about the title song! the same track from her Survivor album? without the background vocals? not a smart move!. Crazy In LOve, Baby Boy are the best tracks!, Naughty Girl it's ok!, the rest of the album is sooooooo booooooooring......but the leading single(Crazy...) makes its worth it to buy it. ""Hip Hop Star"" it's nice, ""Be With You"" it's the last song that you can handle!, ""Me Myself and I"", yuk!, ""Yes"" whassup with this?, ""Signs"", I'm sure Missy hates her, she produce the worst song ever, The rest it's not worth it mention it, the song are just boooooooring."
2,BORING...,"Ok, since when I saw for the first time ""Crazy In Love"" in Tv I wanted to buy this album as earlier as possible, but some friends told me that the album sucked, but after Baby Boy and Me,Myself & I were released I just bought it no matter what my friends say. So, I totally enjoyed the first 6 tracks, but then....WHAT A DECEPTION!!! IT WAS TOTALLY CRAP!!!!don't but this cd, buy the singles!!!!"
1,Bore-yonce,"Who told this woman that whispering and moaning is singing? Her music is slick, overproduced schlock. Nothing interesting. No voice. Overrated. Boring!"
3,Nice effort,"The album was ok, I thought it was gonna be better. I like a few of the songs and thought they were well written but I expected something huge. She's a great artist,performer,singer,and person. She deserves all the grammys and success that God can bless her with but this album was a little disappointing to me."
3,Dangerously Beyonce.,"I can only tell you about ""Crazy In Love"", ""Dangerously In Love 2"", and ""Hip Hop Star"", seeing as though they're the only ones that I listen to. I think ""CIL"" has a nice uptempo beat that'll have you breakin out with the ""uh-oh"" dance at any given moment. ""DIL2"" is a great song. I think that it's well written. Nice lyrics. ""HHS"" has a nice rock feel to it. The other songs on the album really didn't impress me much. I'm glad my cousin gave me this album, that way I would not be mad for wasting my money."
4,What the.........Is this Beyonce,"This cd is like that tracks one through six are my favorites Beyonce is a real good writer and has proved that on this joint for real but she still has a way to go her voice has changed slightly but not a whole lot also I didnt skip from song to song when i poped the cd in my cd player at all and the pictures in the cd book off the rack they like that this cd is worth the money ""Baby Boi"" is my shizt right now i rocked that joint to death when i first heard it on the cd cant wait for another album Bee"
2,Nothing to write home about,"Is it me or does Beyonce seem to ""scream"" her way through her songs. The listener is left wondering if she really can sing because she is SO not exploiting her vocal range (if indeed, she has one). Nonetheless, she will no doubt do well with this album because with Sean Paul, Jay Z and Luther who wouldn't. On a lighter note, the first track is very catchy and will be an instant success for her. For what it's worth Beyonce - well done !!!"
3,Not Deserving of 5 Grammys,"I am a HUGE fan of Crazy in Love (featuring Jay-Z) and Baby Boy (featuring Sean Paul), so I asked for this album for Christmas. It's an okay pick, but I wish that I would've have gotten a better album instead.The catchiest songs are the first four tracks...Crazy in Love, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, and Hip Hop Star (featuring Big Boi). The other good song is her duet with Luther Vandross. Definitely a slow song, but very, very pretty. The rest of the album is not that great. Especially Signs...what the heck is Missy Elliott thinking by being a part of this song?! It is a song about astrological signs. What?! It just doesn't sound right to have Sagittarius and Gemini being thrown around in a song. I must say that I am a bit disappointed with Beyonce's first solo album. I would have enjoyed more upbeat dance tracks.I think Destiny's Child should get back together and make more singles like Bootylicious. That is a good song!"
5,Everytime I get in my car its on...,"Earlier this year, I REALLY REALLY hated Beyonce! But when she came out with ""Crazy In Love"", and I caught myself singing it on more than one occasion, I had to admit that I was starting to like her. The first day the album dropped, I went out and bought it. I was more than pleased. My absolute favorite song is the slow and extremely sexy ""Speechless"". I probably could have done without "" A gift from a Virgo"", but I digress. Basically, I think alot of people who didn't like the cd were expecting a very upbeat cd, but its an r&b cd so u get what you pay for."
2,Why Did I Buy This Cd?,"Oh ya cuz of Crazy In Love? Beyonce is very talented I think this cd was a misstep though. After huge success being the frontwoman of Destiny's Child all 3 decided to do solo albums. Beyonce writes her songs, acts, sings and is very beautiful but I find her album to be dull and one dimensional.I bought this album after hearing Crazy In Love which is one of the top songs of the summer and has an awesome beat. After listening I found several good songs but Beyonce doesnt sing sometimes she sorta forcefully whines or something in songs like Naughty Girl. Then she has another song with Jay-z which is too much. Songs like Signs I found myself very bored listening to. There are other highlights like Baby Boy the second single with Sean Paul which is a great club banger.Beyonce you may want to rethink your next solo album and I suggest you pick up Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep which features Stole which is a classic! Or for this summer try Ashant, Monica and even Blu Cantrell"
1,it's not beyonce's destiny to sing so low,"This c.d. was so dissapointing. I am a big fan of Destiny's child, and bought Kelly Rowland's cd and Michelle's and loved them, but this c.d. was so bad. Crazy in Love sounds like the only decent song to listen to. I tried listening to this cd 3 times, but i can not stand it anymore."
3,Doesn't deserve five grammys but...,"There are quite a few gems in this album, even though some reviewers here think that only the songs that are worth listening to, are released singles, which is untrue. I think Beyonce made a tiny mistake in releasing 'Naughty Girl' since it has a boring beat. Don't rely on the singles to make you decide whether or not the album is worth buying, cos there's some songs on this album that are much better than the released songs like 'baby boy' and 'crazy in love', but to help you decide, let's just say that if you like albums with lots of emotional ballads, this album is for you."
2,not the best,"I don't even know how to describe it. Just not really great. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money on it. Sorry Beyonce, I love you, but this just didn't do it for me. Mediocre that is a good way to describe it. I just have to turn it off after a while because it bores me. I never have done that with a DC disc."
2,not the best,"I don't even know how to describe it. Just not really great. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money on it. Sorry Beyonce, I love you, but this just didn't do it for me."
3,Dangerously Okay,"I think we all already knew Beyonce would come out with an explosive album. Glossy, well produced, and collaborations with the best. Well there are some songs here that I really like, and some I can do without. For example ""Baby Boy"" is a future hit! Then ""Signs"" just gets on my nerves. Enough with the zodiac songs, what is up with her and Tyrese? There is nothing here that moves me, but it has a good cd to vibe to. ""Be With You"" is a really nice jam and that is all I can really say about the cd."
2,Not what i expected at all...,BEYONCE....COME ON NOW. This cd is not what i expected at all. the style is not like the beyonce we know from dc or we've heard on '03 bonnie and clyde. I am dissappointed. The best song on the cd is Crazy in love. I had hoped it would have been better than this.
2,A bunch of commercial crap,"All these collabos with commercial rappers is sickening. This is a solo debut so actually do a song by your self beyonce. The only props I give you is for Me, Myself, and I. This album sucks. I hate it when an artist tries to record all these commercial hits with other commercial artists. This album brings r/b and soul music to shame."
1,Big Disapointment,"I think that this cd was a big mistake for beyonce. she could have done much better. her first song ""crazy in love"" is great. it all goes downhill from there. the duet with luther vandross was pretty good but if you want to buy this cd, it's a waste of your precious time and money! save yourself now!"
4,Dangerously in Love....LOVE tHIS ALBULM,"i love this Cd i love the songs, Beyonce is a very good singer and songwritter."
1,get this barbie doll outa here,beyonce you can not sing. this best song on here was crazy in love and baby boy. all the rest is just plain stupid. if you think about buying this cd please dont. she is all made up with no talent. i don't like jz eaither. stay away from this.
1,The Below five star reviewer is a nut case,Please ignore the rantings of the previous crazy five star reviewer who needs to be reported for being inappropriate for using vile and hateful language against other reviewers.Beyonce is awful and is not recommended to people who like good music.Get any Led Zeppelin album instead.
4,"Slow, yet sensational","Beyonce's album proves her talent and ability to write amazing music. When I purchased the album I was expecting a lot of club hits, however, most of the album is slow jams- which is a suprise. Although, slow, the songs are intricate and are great to ""chill"" to. I definitly recommend it to anyone who likes artists such as Kelly Price, Floetry or Whitney. There are a number of Jazzy/blusey tunes. Great solo Beyonce!"
1,Try Again Beyonce,"Sex seems to be the only thing on her mind now, like 75% of her mind. I was hoping to learn more about her as an artist but I was left hanging. Well I guess she has to be nasty to compete. I was expecting her to give more vocally and more creatively. I wasn't impressed and to use a song off of the survivor cd was just plain tacky, she should have saved that song for CD in the first place. The Daddy song was sweet though!!!"
3,"Bold, diverse and rhythmic CD","Beyonce is a go-getter and she certainly takes bold and admirable steps with her debut CD. There are certain cuts that stand out and have become favorites (The Closer I Get To You, Yes, and Signs); some of the other selections are gonna take a few more listens (Me, Myself and I, and Hip-Hop Star). They are not immediately captivating and it could be because the melodies are different (yet they are nice and do stand out in terms of what every other singer is doing these days). I think the production of this CD is excellent. I love what I construe as Beyonce's confidence - she doesn't seem afraid to take risks, and it seems she is carving out a niche for herself. I would buy her future CD's."
2,Didn't Live Up To The Hype,"Beyonce is very beautiful and talented, so it pains me to have to write a negative review of her CD. I wanted to give an objective review, so I listened repeatedly and drew the same conclusion each time. I found the music uninspiring and just plain dull. The lyrics were typical fluff and lacking in creativity and substance. Her singing was just ok for me but a tad bit dull and annoying after repeated listens. While I did find three songs to my liking, I rather generously give this CD 2 stars. I am really excited for Beyonce for doing her thing but was unimpressed with her first solo effort."
5,My Favorite Contemporary R&B Album,This is definately a masterpiece. Every song is fiya. I have ben listening to this since i bought it and i felt it deserved my review. Beyonce is the best performer of our generation. The singles never get old.Must Listens (other than the singles)- Be With You- Yes- Speechless- Dangerously In LoveAlso Listen TO (Didnt make the CD for some odd reason)- Work It Out- Wishing On A Star
1,YAWWWWNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hate spending hard earned cash on crap. I don't get all the hoopla over this cd (you know, winning awards and all). It is unoriginal and quite frankly, not very entertaining. I think Beyonce, the person is big, but the music is lacking. It sounds like everything else out there in this genre (Mya, Ashanti, etc., etc.). Do yourself a big favour, ignore this and go to the Aretha Franklin section in your record store, now that is something sweet."
3,Dangerously Bland,"Beyonce is a beautiful young woman and has a voice(I'm not even sure if it is so great as everyone hypes it to be) but this cd is just ok. I don't see how she won five grammys for this material. I feel a great cd should have a mix of uptempo, midtempo, and ballads. This cd is just marred down with a lot of slow tempo and ballad-like songs that really don't hit the soul. When I listen to an R&B cd I like to hear songs that hit the soul. ""Crazy in Love"" is a great song with a killer beat but that's where the fun ends. I think alot of people bought this album based on that one song expecting the others to be similar. The cd has 4 uptempo songs followed by 11 subpar ballads and slow tempo songs that sound alike and mesh into each other. The cd is not the worst cd but it definitely isn't great. If you want hear how this cd should have sounded listen to Tamar's (Toni Braxton's sister) cd."
2,Mediocre album from an exceptional singer,"I bought this album thinking it would be tight: ""it's Beyonce so they're gonna give her nothin but hits for her album..."" how wrong I was. Crazy in love was hot, Baby Boy was hot, Hip hop star was a hot mess, Be With You was hot, The Closer I Get to You was a dissapointment, Yes, Me Myself and I, and just about every other song on the album I didn't mention (espescially The Closer I get to You) were flat out boring and that daddy song just made me uncomfortable, why was that on there??? I loved Dangerously in Love on Survivor and was excited to see what she would do differently with it on this album... the b*tch didn't even resing the vocals!!! She just put different production behind it and called it a day, but whatever. Anyways I'm kinda sorry I spent my 8 dollars on that album instead of just downloading the few songs I liked on it."
3,Definitely not worth the money,"Beyonce Knowles's debut release, Dangerously In Love, isn't at all what I expected. I don't think it was worth so many Grammy awards. The only songs I really liked are ""Crazy In Love,"" ""Naughty Girl"" and ""Baby Boy."""
2,Only the first 2 single's she released are good other then..,...That the album is realy realy bad!I feel like it's not worth it to buy it dosent have quality in the songs they sound realy realy bad!I hope you guy's believe me because this is my honest truth!
5,"Beautiful, Very Beautiful","This CD is that deal. I absolutely love it. If you love R&B and haven't listened to this album, you're missing out. Beyonce did a wonderful job on this album. I enjoyed every song. She is a very talented young lady and I look forward to buying her next album."
3,Beyonce Fares Well,"Since the beginning of destiny's child everyone has always questioned why beyonce sang all the leads. well it is true thatshe is the loudest but as far as the best,thats not all that true.in fact kelly and michelle sings better than her some times.on this album she doest sing like she does with destiny's childshe kind of sounds flat.which maybe because she's finally not trying to out side two certain girls(hint:kelly&michelle;)the songs are very meaningful so thats what really saves the album from being another ""hotcoko""/""kandi""release."
1,Dangerously Dissappointing,"Her single ""Crazy in Love"" is really fantastic, I love that track, ""Naughty Girl"" is a great song too. The rest of the CD. Crap, I wish it had more songs like those 2 singles. Painful to listen to it."
1,Hmmmmm,"Ok, this album was pretty awful. (before you freak out, I'm not Lewis Tatem, he's my dad, and I wrote the review of the DEJ7855 sony cd walkman, and the one about the animatrix dvd, and By the Way by the red hot chili peppers) In fact this album verges on horrible. But the track ""crazy in love"" is well worth the disc. All the other songs, excpt. ""baby boy"" suck. This disc is good if you are a 14 year old amuter DJ, for junior girl scout meetings (me). Otherwise, just buy the ""crazy in love"" and ""baby boy"" singles."
1,Miss wanna be the center of attention,"She was okay when they first started out, now she got the big head and thinks she better than everybody."
3,"Hopefully, #500, but, well...","This album features some of the stranger tracks ever done by Missy Elliott (""Signs,"" or the ""I was in love with [cough] Jay-Z [cough] a Sagittarius, and he was also an Aries, Taurus, Pisces, and everything between the previous two signs"" song) and Jay-Z (the horrible ""Crazy in Love"" and ""That's How You Like It""--thank God for The Black Album) The best tracks to me are ""Be with You"" through ""Yes"" and ""Speechless."" The upbeat beginning is too bombastic and sounds like a failed version of any experimental album ever created from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to Speakerboxx/The Love Below. The latter songs are sappy ballads. Thematically, it's Survivor all over again, without ""I-think-I-can-sing"" Michelle and Kelly (who can do better than Simply Deep)."
2,she can dance but I dislike her voice,"she is much better than britney, she can dance but I do not like her style! my style of music is not really ! just bought the cd for my girl friend's birthday"
3,Beyonce Best Album??,Beyonce's album Dangerously in Love was good. I really liked the song Baby Boy featuring Sean Paul and Crazy In Love featuring Jay Z. Many people might say the other songs aren't good now jus because she hasn't made music videos for them. Many people say its not a good cd but yet lots of people are buying the cd.
3,<<<<<Dangerously OK>>>>>,"I bought Beyonce's solo debut album because I was helping the whole support Destiny's Child thing. Plus ""Crazy In Love"" is an alright song. I was reading the credits and basically most of her songs are sampled and therefore unoriginal. The songs are ok and they are not that bad but it could have been more original for a solo debut. Songs that should NOT have been on the album is ""Speechless"" and ""Gift from Virgo""--- WHAT WAS SHE THINKING it sounds like unorganized junk. The highlightes of the CD is ""Dangerously In Love 2""-- it sound the same as ""Dangerously In Love"" (From ""Survivor"") so the ""2"" is dumb.. I like Michelle's voice in that song.. ""Hip Hop Star"" is nice but different and I can't listen to it that much but it is a definite highlight.. ""Dangerously In Love"" is a satisfactory effort on Knowles' part. But I think you should go and but Michelle Williams' ""Heart To Yours"" or Kelly Rowland's ""Simply Deep"" unless you really want to buy the CD for the risque pictures."
5,I was NOT a Beyonce fan but this CD is off the HOOK!,Admittidly I was not the biggest Beyonce fan after the whole group break up thing but I HIGHLY recommed this CD to any real music lover... Jigga man must be doing her right because this CD damn near takes you through their whole relationship and she does it in a manner where we can all relate... THUMBS UP to u Beyonce and keep doing what you're doing because this is one of the few CDs where atleast 90% of it is good... the only song she could have kept is #4 (hip-Hop Star) but other than that its a hit! L8ta!
3,OK,"This CD is OK. The first few tracks are a lot of fun, but as the CD progresses, it gets boring, with the exception of my favorite track on the entire CD, ""That's How You Like It,"" an amazingly catchy track written by Jay-Z."
2,She could've added at least one more upbeat song...,"If you hear ""Crazy in Love"" or ""Baby Boy"" on the radio and think that's what the rest of the album will sound like, sorry. Those songs are tricks to make you think the rest of the album will be upbeat and danceable, and they are the only two good ones. Songs like ""Signs"", ""Speechless"" and ""The Closer I get to You"" put you to sleep, ""That's how you like it"" and ""Hip-hop star"" are full of rappers making nonsensical noises in the background and ""Be With You"", ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Yes"" are full of annoying dighital sounds and beats. And even ""Crazy in Love"" and ""BabY boy"" are really not all THAT great. If you value music at all, do not buy this TRASH. Buy Aaliyah or a DC cd for good Beyonce material."
3,I wish that Dangerously in Love was a better cd,"When I purchased this cd I thought that I would enjoy Beyonce's music. However, I found that I could not stand the lyrics on most of the songs."
3,it's Ok I like it,"I don't believe she should have won five grammy's she could have gotten two or three but not five. I think she is just over done. People need to take a step back and really look at what beyonce is giving us, This is a Destiny's Child Album (without the other members)Just like the first three, but they were on the cover."
4,Great CD,"I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child, so of course I was first in line to get Beyonce's solo CD. And while it is definitely not like a DC album, it's still the best solo female CD to come out since Alicia Keys' Songs in A Minor. My favorite songs are Crazy in Love, Hip Hop Star, Be With You and That's How You Like It. The songs that I'm not really crazy about (yet) are Daddy, Yes, and Signs, which is kind of a pointless song because it's just about the astrological signs. Anyway, this is a good CD, definitely worth the money. It'll hold you over until the next DC album."
2,"it was alrite, expected better:",I wasnt really wasnt feeling this one. Theres only like 3 good songs on here. Crazy in love is the best one. Second one is thats how u like it with JayZ and yes. Shes trying too hard to sound sexy it ruins the songs.Personally i like Kelly Rowlands CD better.Overall they have better albulms when they are a group.
2,Naughty Girl,"After seeing Beyonce playing the w-h-o-r-e once again on the BET Awards, you realize that on DC's song, Nasty Girl, Beyonce was talking about herself. Is there anything this t-r-a-m-p won't do for a dollar or a little fame? She has absolutely no artistic integrity. There's nothing she WON'T do. She's the w-h-i-t-e man's black woman. And that's who she'll end up with. And that's who she needs to be with. Jay-Z won't be good enough for her in a little while. Mark my words. Don't worry Be, Jude and Brad might be available again soon."
1,SHAME ON YOU IF YOU HAVE THIS ALBUM,"GAYonce is one of the worst singers of this century along with Britney,Lindsay and ASHLEE.She cant sing,act or dance for nuts.I HATE HER AND SO SHOULD YOU IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC.No stars.Get screaming for vengeance from Judas Priest instead."
2,overrated and unoriginal,"I like ""Me, Myself and I"" and that's it. Other than that, B is nothing but an overrated, unoriginal woman who's trying to copy the likes of Tina(a great music icon) Janet, Mariah, Mary and so on. Her songwriting skills are dumb as hell and ppl appraise it like she originated it. THere are way more talented ppl out there who deserve more attention. B is nothing more than a puppet who happens to be dating Jay-Z. If you want to listen to someone with great talent, go for Heather Headley, Erykah Badu, Lalah Hathaway, India Aire, Me'shell Ndegeocello(she even plays her own instruments). So stop following this puppet and soon she'll realize that she's nothing but a poor imitator."
5,THE BEST,THIS ALBUM IS OFF THE HOOK AND SHE IS MUCH BETTER OFF SOLO.IT MAY BE LIKE 2 SONGS ON THE CD THAT NEEDS WORK BUT THE REST ARE GREAT ESPECIALLY YES AND SIGNS..I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CHECK IT OUT
3,Not what I expected,I expected so much better coming from Beyonce. I wasn't a big fan of hers at first but I love Crazy in Love cause it remains me so much of situations I've been through. And I'm thinking with all the artists featured on here I would like more songs on here then I do unfortunately I was disappointed but who knows maybe I'll get my 15.00 worth and the album will grow on me.
2,beyonce????,"her cd cover looks like christina aguilera's, her voice is ok, her talent is ok, she is an ok artist. sorry it is an honest review."
3,Half and Half,"You can divide this album into two parts. The bad half and the good half.The good half includes:Crazy In Love, Signs, The Closer I Get To You, Me Myself and I, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy and YesThe bad half:Hip Hop StarVirgoAll The Rest of the songsI have to agree with the person who refered the music we have these days, they are like scabs and have no credibility. I don't think Beyonce fits under that category. I went to her concert while she was on tour with Alicia and Missy, and I enjoyed it.I do believe JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SUCKS!Buy Beyonce, but if not, buy any MICHAEL JACKson albums!"
2,Dangerously In Love=DANGER!!,"i bought this CD thinking that it would be amazing and mind blowing and when i put in my CD player...i wanted to throw this CD away...i really like Beyonce but going solo isn't exactly her destiny...my favorite song(s) were Crazy In Love, Dangerously In Love 2, and The Way I Like It.....sorry B"
1,DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD!!!,"From these obvious fanatics of Beyonce. I was expected a lot from her solo project but it is so boring, some of the songs will literally put you to sleep! Nothing on the album deserves a 10, at best it deserves a C+. If you like buying average to poor music that you can hear on every radio station across the country get this one. Otherwise, you should pass this one up. It sounds rushed, the lyrics are very childish, and the ONLY reason why this album is getting any attention at all is because it's from the Destiny's Child front woman.It's really not worth the buy."
2,Not like Destiny at all,"I'm a reasonbly big Destiny's Child fan, though not a really huge fan, and I thought I'd pick this up. How awful! None of the playfulness that characterized her work with Destiny Child is present in this album.Basically, you can sum this album up in three categories:1) ""Crazy in Love"", which is a really good song.2) All the other collaborations, most of which hardly feature Beyonce at all.3) Boring, slow, downtempo R&B grooves.For me, that wasn't enough to enjoy this at all."
3,beyonce what are you doing???!!!,"she is the only talented artist with soul out there right now, but the problem is she's using her looks and body to get herself on top and the material she's coming out with is medicore. This album was a disappointment, I expected more from her. She should only get grammys when the material is good, and I know she'll do much better in the future if she starts doing good music like in the old days again and dumps Cray-Z"
4,great album from a talented singer,"first time i listenned the album i wasnt really into it.but after a couple of times i thought it was a great first album.she is one of the most talented singer today.people who say she has no talent probably never saw her performing.the album has a lot of different influences from pop/rnb (naughty girl),hip hop,70's soul,and even jazz with the remake of ""rainy day"" from shuggie otis which is called ""a gift from a virgo"".i know beyonce is destined to be a legend that's why i know she will be able to do better than this album.my favorites are ""crazy inlove"",""be with u"" and ""speechless"".i recommend this album for those who like crazy sexy and cool singers."
4,Extra Credit,"This is for Mr. Popplewell's class.(extra credit)Well I think this CD is very good. It keeps you energized the entire time. It also makes you want to get up, go crazy, and dance! If you need to buy one CD, buy this one, there are many good songs. Some songs are just O.K. but the rest of the songs are awsome. I hope this encourages you to buy Dangerously in Love. I liked it I hope you do to!"
2,1st opportunity: wasted,"Beyoncè has a great voice and a lot of talent, but the tracks of this album are not allowing her to show either of them. And - by the way - track n. 5 sounds way too much like a song from 4 or 5 years ago. Try again, Beyoncé (and . btw - less ballads, please)."
5,The Beyonce We Never Knew!!!!!,When I first got Beyonce Album I thought it would sound like the destiny's child songs but it didn't. Her sound is very different from the others. I mean when I first heard it I thought it was strange but when you listen again I fell in love with the Album I have to listen to it everyday. I like all her songs except Hip Hop Star I don't know what she was thinking there but the as for the rest of the album it's da bomb I can't wait until the Next Destiny's Child Album they been away to long but if you're a true fan of Beyonce then get the Album because it's hot. I give it 6 stars!!!!!!!!!
5,One of Sarah's Best!,"I am in love with this album. My first introduction to Sarah Vaughan was through her ""songbooks"" (Gerswhin, Porter). I loved the lush orchestral backgrounds, but also longed for more informal and/or ""jazzy"" settings. This album provides just this. Sarah has a small collection of musicians, so you really get to hear and appreciate her unmatched voice and technique. This album is tingling; it is sensational. Sarah scats, delivers ballads, and proves why she is both ""sassy"" and ""divine."" Buy it!!!"
2,Difficult for young children to visualize the letters,"My daughter loves dogs so I thought she could learn the alphabet and enjoy the pictures of the dogs. Well, she loved the pictures of the dogs, but the letters were very difficult for her to visualize. This is not a book to help with the alphabet as much as it is for the visual creativity."
2,Cute...but not good for little ones,"The book is cute, but it is difficult to decipher the letters that the dogs are forming. I bought this book because we have a weimaraner and I thought my son would really be able to relate to the book. Unfortunately, that was not the case. He is just learning his ABCs (he's 20 months) and I do not feel that the letters are obvious enough for teaching purposes. It is artistically great, but not for little kids."
3,"Great movie,but too many unanswered questions","Here I go again...Ninja Resurrection:Hell's Spawn was great visually,as always.But I was a little disappointed that the story line wasn't developed enough.And as I am not a big fan of cliffhangers in an anime,I was really hoping to see a huge battle between Jubei and Shiro. I did like the introduction of new characters in the plot.But for the next movie,I REALLY hope that it comes with tha'funk...so to speak...between Jubei and Shiro.Otherwise, it will be a waste of time.But,I will still watch it...."
2,Absolute waste of time,"This is (I presume) a comedy. Could have been a good gag on japanime if wouldn't been too harsh and Ninja Scroll haven't been such a neat movie. The story is horrible (as it was supposed to be). The storyline is worthless (well, they made a point there). Characters are hollow and their development is sketchy and jumps as a mad rabbit (whatever). Final fight scene is a total embbarassment although funny. Graphics were taken from Ninja Scroll (mostly). Extra star goes for consistent efforts to embbarass otaku :-)."
2,Save your money,"As stated by others, no true relation whatsoever to the excellent Ninja Scroll movie. The gore is fun and the animation decent, but it's two episodes that don't lead anywhere, as they were the intended first half of a four-episode saga later cancelled. One of the very few animes I ever traded in."
1,Oh God..I Have Sinned,"That is how you will feel after watching this. I ran into this movie like years ago when it first came out and brought it thinking it was ninja scroll part 2. Man was I wrong. After watching this I felt like going to church or going into a corner and praying, especially after a scene where the bad guys are worshipping satan by standing up and chanting satan satan satan for like 2 minutes... here are some of the things you will see in this movie:1. Demon Rape2. Demon Ninja fighting with his intestines.3. Dismembered Demon finger crawling into a womans uh..nether regions (and why? WHO THE HELL KNOWS)4. Murder of ChildrenI might have let all that slide if the movie was actually good but its.. so bad.. the worst part is there is no conclusion. it just ends very abruptly during a very violent scene that leaves you feeling like.""Whaaa??"" Beware."
1,Worst movie EVER!,"This movie is a piece of junk. The Animation is poor (almost as bad as the animation from the originial Vampire Hunter D), the voice acting was horrible, and the plot... well, there was no plot. It was 80 min of pure [stuff]. I had to give this movie 1 star because there is no option for no stars. As a matter of fact, this movie owes me a star."
1,Simply awful,"If you loved ""Ninja Scroll"" go watch it again, and don't waste your time on this. It is simply awful. None of the action you expect. It all seems over-rehearsed. Moreover, there is more of a theological message in ""Pulp Fiction"" than in this failed attempt. Don't waste your time."
4,A nice feudal anime,"ok people, let's get things straight. THIS IS NOT THE NINJA SCROLL SEQUEL!!! this is a different jubei, a different time setting, and a different stroyline. about the storyline, it is just so damn spacious!!! at some points, i couldn't tell what the hell was going on until i watched it over and over. let me tell you somethin, though, the fighting scenes are cool, but the blood is a little transparent. being brought back to life throught sex is very interesting as well. the problem that mainly concerned me was the ending!!! want to know what i'm talking about go buy this movie."
1,This movie lacked a lot of things.,I am a big fan of anime. I thought it was going to be Ninja Scroll 2. It even says it on the back. What a joke it discraces anime. I wasted a good twenty bucks on this. IT IS NOT THE SEQUEL TO NINJA SCROLL!!! DO NOT BUT THIS MOVIE.
1,THIS MOVIE WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF 50 MINUTES OF MY LIFE!!!,"This movie should be drug out into the middle of the street and shot. I can't beleive that they would discrace N.S. like that. Please don't buy this movie, or even waste your precious time watching it."
1,Major disappointment,"I watched this movie like everyone else, thinking it was somehow related to Ninja Scroll. Ha, what a disappointment it was. Seemed to have nothing to do with Ninja Scroll other than Ninja in the title and Jubei for the name of one of the characters. Do not watch. A complete waste of time. I am now dumber for having watched this movie."
1,This is the absolute bottom of the barrel,Great voices. (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!) Well drawn. (Ditto) Ninja Scroll 2. (Double Ditto) Worth the money I spent. (Boo hoo hoo.)
1,Be sure to lower your expectations before viewing this tape.,"Ninja Scroll is my favorite Japanese animated movie. This movie, however, has nothing to do with Ninja Scroll. It would have been nice for ADV to tell us this. To be honest I did like the animation and the last 10 to 15 minutes of the tape are really good, but that's it. The rest of the movie stinks.... BAD! This movie has to have one of the most boring and slow-moving story lines I have ever had the misfortune to experience in my life. It claims to run for only 50 minutes, but I felt like I sat through Titanic by the time any action gets going (the last 10 to 15 minutes I was talking about before). My advice is watch Ninja Scroll again and stay away from this movie."
4,buy this movie,"This is one of the best anime OAV series i have seen. It has action and lots of gore (including heads cut in half and geysers of blood) and is set at a good pace. The only thing that could have been better is if it had no story, just Jubei running around killing everything. This is basically a slasher movie, so dont buy it if you dont like blood. But if that doesnt bother you and you like a good action series, dont hesitate, buy it now, in fact, stop reading this and go buy it you're wasting time that you could be using to watching this masterpiece."
3,We'll just see if they can pull it off...,"I just watched this movie and I am not quite sure what to think. I didn't see any similarity between this movie and Ninja scroll other than the fancy swordwork. So far I am undecided as to how the movie was. As you may have read in other reviews, it comes to a rather abrupt ending with the infamous ""to be continued..."" leaving the viewer more than a little dissatisfied. I am going to reserve judgement on this film until I see part two. I don't recommend buying this movie, at least not until part two comes out. Til then, just rent it or watch it at a friends house."
2,Hoax.,"Don't be fooled. This is not a sequal to Ninja Scroll. In fact, it's not even the same Jubei. Can we say ""Marketing Ploy"" I admit, it is a fine movie unto itself, but a disgrace to call it Ninja Scroll 2. Do not expect the nonstop action and superior animation of Ninja Scroll. It's not even Us Manga, And it's not even the same animators. On it's own, I'd give it 4 stars, but because of the shameless market ploy, I give it two."
3,not a sequel!!!,"While the history of jubei is excellent in the anime scene... Watch out! The character in this video dosen't resemble the ""jubei"" we all know and love from ninja scroll. Ninja resurrection has excellent animation and a decent story begining. But thats the problem, just when this movie starts to become interesting it stops with a dissapointing black screen displaying the cryptic words ""to be continued"". 50 minutes of video followed by a ""to be continued"" isn't worth 20+ dollars."
1,Don't confuse with Ninja Scroll.,"This is a poor ""successor"" to Ninja Scroll. It's not made by the same production studio or director. And even falls during a different time period. The only similarity is the existence of a guy named ""Jubei."" Mediocre animation, fairly good dubbing, excessive violence (the only plus) and a weak storyline. Overall, if you're a Ninja Scroll zealot, you'll very likely become annoyed (if not angered) by this 40 minute 'introduction' to an anime series which was never completed."
1,"If you Loved Ninja Scrolls, you will regret this purchase","Ninja Scrolls had mature artwork, dynamic action, developed characters and a deep story. The violence in Ninja Scrolls was inherent to the story.Ninja Resurrection has that childish, low detail artwork. The story is VERY weak. The characters have little development (you barely see Jubei in the second episode). The ULTRA, ULTRA violence belongs in something like Legend of the Overfiend - a repugnant anime of sick and twisted proportions. Contrary to popular belief, this show is not for adults. It for violence loving perverts.I just received this DVD, just finished watching it, and just finished dumping it into my garbage bag. What a disappointment."
4,If you like the DVD...,"Louie Rune Soldier is a four-issue manga series. The anime and manga share some stories, and the manga has some additional standalone ""middle"" stories not on the DVD. Omake includes a few color pages and a few four-panel gag strips of the author's suffering when creating the manga. While the manga's just as good as the anime, I should mention that the complete anime boxed set is *cheaper* than the manga. This set costs less than the four manga volumes, and contains the twenty-four episodes of the entire series."
1,Dissapointing,"Ok, this had the best animation I've ever seen, but what the hell is going on??? I never knew there were rocket launchers and rocketships in Feudal Japan!! Man, is the historical accuracy bad. This was a complete waste of 40 minutes of my life."
3,Rent it First!!,"When i bought this, i thought it was the sequel to Ninja Scroll. As is said in all of the other reviews, it is not. The plot to this movie dosn't make a whole lot of sence, and is a bit complicated for the length of each piece. The only real redeeming factor about it is the great action, and the gore. Rent it first, and if you like it buy it, but its probably not worth the cash."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money (You've Been Warned),"This film has so many problems it's hard to know where to start but let's begin with the fact that this is heavily marketed as the sequel of Ninja Scroll be asured that it is not a sequel nor does it have anything in common with ninja scroll other than the name of the protagonist of both films. Now moving onto the film itself the story is just terrible and random it never really develops or gives explanation for much of the films events which as I have said are very random. The characters, much like the plot, have little to know development and are almost instantley forgetable. Add all this up and toss in the gratuitious and excesive gore and a few scenes of nudity and you have one of the worst anime films to have ever been made. However if you are just determined to see this film please watch it online or rent it before committing to buying this huge heaping helping of garbage consider yourselves warned people"
2,eh...i like it more than most ppl do,"i guess i didn't expect a ninja scroll sequel, so i wasn't let down by this. its really bad in some respects. its two episodes of an OVA series that never went anywhere really. the music is great, the animation is some of the best i've seen, the actions scenes are stylish. this is jubei YAGYU the historical figure not ninja scroll's jubei kibagami. they develop characters only to have them die off immediately in the most bloody way. i could rag on it all day, but the sound and animation are good enough to warrant a watch. if you're expecting a sequel to ninja scroll you'll be sorely disappointed."
2,What was this,"While I am into the gore and animation, this had NOTHING to do with Ninja Scroll and it would be an insult to consider them related. Yes, the centrl character is Jubei, but it isn't even the same one. I would NOT reccomend a purchase but rather checking out blockbuster or downloading it off of the internet. It wasn't realy worthy of the $[dollar amount] asked for the DVD."
1,Deceiving Title,"Maybe I wouldn't have been so harsh with the rating had they not deceived people by claiming the movie to the excellent ""Ninja Scroll"". I also felt cheated by the short running time. I don't understand why they couldn't package parts 1 and 2 on the same tape. I guess I do, it's all about the money. The problem with that being that after viewing part 1, I had no desire to go and rent or buy part 2. The animation is decent but the storyline wasn't interesting. I have seen lots of anime and a good anime has more than just blood and guts. It must have an interesting story. It fails in that respect."
4,Not Ninja scroll but what is?,"The animation is very smooth and the fight sceans are done with style. It is not as good as Nija Scroll true enough but then again what really is? Don't compair it to the best and it comes out pretty good, remeber this is a good moive on its own just because it was made by the same company that made Ninja Scroll dose not mean that it has to be the same."
4,"Not a sequel, but not bad.","Yeah, so it wasn't exactly a contiuation of scroll, but it still has what it takes to be good anime. My only complaint is breking it up into parts making you spend more and waiting longer to see it all. But in the end it's all a matter of taste anyway. Bottom line...good flick, cool action, evolving storyline. Can't wait to see the next one."
2,It was wack,"I thought that this movie was pretty wack. Although I liked the gore and blood and everything, it was too short and the plot didn't flow right. If you are a Ninja Scroll fan like myself, then you'll be disappointed in this movie."
2,"Can you say ""it sucked?""","If you're looking for the sequel to the greatest anime of all time, Ninja Scroll, this ain't it. Period. The animation was second rate, and often scenes were narrated without animation, only prints, wall hangings, etc. This is NOT Jubei ""Scroll-style."" I, for one, am not eagerly awaiting the next installment."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"Knowing that this was NOT the sequel to the infamous ""Ninja Scroll"" I reluctantly rented this at blockbuster video, which was one of the smartest things i have done. This movie is a complete waste of money and time. There is absolutely NO character development, poor story line, and even the supposedly main character is only seen at the end. This movie is a disgrace to have Ninja Scroll ""tied"" in with the cover. If i wasted $3.00 on renting this, i feel sorry for those who bought it. My advice to my fellow anime fans is, avoid this movie at all cost."
5,it was bad ass.,"i dont know what people r thinking when they said that Ninja Resurrection sucked. it was bad ass. not only did it make me hate christians for weeks, the story is hell-a better than ninja scroll!!! see it i says, see it."
1,What a disappointment!,"When I heard that a sequel to Ninja Scroll was released on VHS, I eagerly waited for its release on DVD. As soon s it was released, I purchased a copy from Reel.com. I was so disappointed with this movie that I returned it the following day! Thank goodness Reel.com had a ""no questions asked"" return policy.The plot was practically non-existant. The little action that they had was poor. The overall animation was marginal at best. Save your money and time on something more worthwile."
1,Totally (...)!!,"Was a complete waste of money! I LOVED Ninja Scroll! and thats why I bought Ninja Ressurection, in the belief that it would be just as good..To be honest.. It wasnt good at all.. The storyline.. heck WHAT storyline?? The images.. *blergh*.. and the ending...?? WHAT ending??!! Ninja Ressurection seemed more like an introduction to a whole new series...After the 'movie' finished I felt like throwing something at the TV. Thats how bad it was!"
2,not that good,i knew it was not the sequel of ninja scrol but i thought i might be as good as it..the story is kinda complicated i didnt bother my self understanding it..but where is the ending of the story?i hate it when that happens...i hated the rape scese i just hate that..if u dont have anythin else to rent then try this one but dont buy it ..buy somethin else..the drawing isnt that well done as it shows in the cover
2,"Boring Story, Hard to Follow.",Ninja R. is a diffucult story to follow as it jumps from and to differnt times. If you understand the story it's very intersting but it ends very badly; as if the staff just decided to give it a quick ending. Animation and fight scenes are very well done but's about it.
2,This is Not Ninja Scroll 2!,"Don't be fooled like I was. This company obviously comes as close to stealing ideas as any that I have seen. I saw the Legend of Crystania (stolen from Lodoss War) which I admit was good. Once I found out that this was not Manga, i still had high hopes, thinking that this could still be good. It wasn't. Maybe I was just too disappointed at the fact that this was not NS2 that I didn't give myself a chance to like it, but even if i did, it just didn't run that well. There are some nice bloody scenes, but that is all of 5 minutes, and the movie (part) itself is only 50 minutes long. This is definately not worth the money, as the whole thing is a lie to get your money. Please don't be fooled. It is very disappointing."
3,"Had potential, but fell short","After watching Revenge of Jubei, I went into Hell Spawn, expecting a bit more than I got. The demons were great, the plot was sound...the rebirth of Satan on earth...Jubei and Musashi were the reluctant heroes, but at that point the film ended....that to me was the huge letdown...just as we're getting set for their to be the climactic battle....the film ended... Obviously the creators planned for a followup, and I believe it's scheduled for a late 2000 release, but I may be wrong. If you're a fan of swordplay anime, then you should enjoy this for what it is, which is swordplay anime....you will be let down by the ending though...."
3,"IT`S NOT A NEW NINJA SCROLL, BUT IT`S GOOD","First thing ; This got NOTHING to do with Ninja Scroll, even if they have used the same name for their character Jubei. And another thing ; This movie DESERVES its ""18 yers or older rating"", because there are, as in many ninja animes, extreme violence all over the place. The plot is good, the speech is good and the pure ""drawing"" quality is excellent. One thing that could be a good thing, but isn't, is that this is just the beginning ; and when i say ""just the beginning"" i MEAN just the beginning. There isn't an ending in this video. Damn. This is just Part 1 and 2 out of God knows how many. But, it's worth buying if you think it's cool with ninjas and samurais and alot of swordplaying (I do)."
4,darker,"This is not exactly a true sequel to Ninja Scroll. Infact this story contains characters from actual Japanese history - Yagyu Jubei & Musashi Miyamoto were apparently real, as was the clamp down on christianity by the shogunate (many a christian was crucified upside down). This film is actualy much darker than Ninja Scroll.. and its really very good. Only problem being that its the beggining of a series which was abandoned and never made (so Im told)"
3,"Not rock bottom, but not great","Well, the major thing I didn't like about this movie was that, as many people have said, it had nothing to do with Ninja Scroll. Also, for the majority of the movie, it made the people who were the ""bad guys"" look good. Call me crazy, but I don't fell like cheering for guys who surround a church full of innocent people and shooting them. And for the guy who said ""It made me hate Christians for weeks"", you must have really hated Christians to start with. But other than that it was... okay. Just okay."
2,Nope,this was a big waste of time! It took to long to start (thanks to that little history lesson) and once it did it left to many questions. This movie is low buget! ADV tried to create a run off of ninja scoll and failed. This has no connection to ninja scroll so all of you who are looking for more ninja scroll action...watch ninja scroll again because this is not it.
3,damn dissapointing,"I am a huge fan of anime, and have been since the days of the early Ranma 1/2 (yappapa yappapa eenshannten...). When I first picked up the original Ninja Scroll movie, I was enthralled by it. masterful animation, incredible plot, and superb dialogue. So, naturally, I expected this to be as good, if not better. I was utterly dissapointed with the quality of the anime. The animation was by no means as good as the first, and the over-dramatic score in the goofiest places proved to make it even cheesier. I was really really dissapointed in the plot. I like Ninja Scroll because it focuse solely and completely on the mideival japanese period, a preiod wich intrigues me. This glorified the passage of Christianity into Japan to an extent wich almost made me cry... The fact that they could possibly pass this off as the return of a ledgend (as the ad told me) appauls me. honestly, I was po'ed with it."
4,"This movie has nothing to do with ""Ninja Scroll""..","This anime series is actually based on the live action movie ""Ninja Resurrection"" and not the anime ""Ninja Scroll"". Don't buy the movies in this series because you think it is Ninja Scroll 2. Buy this series because it contains an excellent story line, lots of gore, and ninjas, ninjas, ninjas!"
4,A Little Left of Center,"Like the millions of fans who loved Ninja Scroll, I was excited to hear about a sequel. Except this just isnt it. There are no characters from Ninja Scroll present.If fact this Jubei doesnt even have the same last name! After watching though, the movie is fairly good. The animation is a little stiff and nowhere near as good as Ninja Scroll, but oh well. The dubbing is commendable. Definitely see it, you can do worse. Be warned though it does have extreme violence and some anti-christian setiments."
3,In feudal japan they had rocket ships(lol)....,I just got started watching anime...ive never seen ninja scroll.... but i know that this was never meant to be a sequel anyway. But the story is pretty good and so is the animation. But the ninja rocket ship and rocket launchers?....WTF is that?!..This is supposed to be feudal Japan!! O well...hahaha...still damn good.Would have gave it 4 if it werent for the rocket ship which about ruined the whole feel of the movie!!!!!
3,only for die hard gory fans,"first off this anime in no way is related to ""ninja scroll"" thank god.this film lacks in character and plot.some of my favorite anime are very bloody like ninja scroll,or vampire hunter but this just goes ridiculesly to far with the blood and guts the only reason im givin this film 3 stars is becouse the ninja/samaraui anime's are always my favorites,but definetly not this one.ya might want to rent it or borrow a copy from your ... friend who just bougt it""just to say you saw it"" hey if you never wacthed bad anime how can you judge whats good?"
1,Waste of time,"Ugh....talk about s DVD regretting to get. If you have any tastes at all don't touch this. Ninja Scroll was better...but not by much. Both movies are overrated pieces of garbage.Try Samurai X if you want a decent DVD. Otherwise, save your money for something else...Cowboy Bebop would work, yes"

4,thie primer..,i used variety of diffent primers..and this one does make my skin feel minty-fresh as i put it on.but after 2mins(like the direction says) it drys out ;i whether recommend you M.A.C primer
1,Not what I expected,"Philosophy...usually a great name in the world of skin care, so, I purchased this product and hada really bad reaction.methylparaben, propylparaben...this is the reason for my bad reaction.Live and learn...."
2,Not the miracle advertised in magazines,"Does make a slick surface when applied, dried for 2 min as instructed; but, does nothing to minimize pores which it claimed to do....."
2,Disappointed,"I was on the search for the BEST primer that didn't add shine to my already combination skin. I LOVE Philosophy & thought I'd LOVE the Present too (& the price was GREAT), but it didn't hold up to my expectations. It's much thicker than most primers & very little is needed. It states to wait 2 min's before applying make-up & I've tried between 2 min's - 30 min's to see if that made a difference. By mid-morning I'd find my make-up was starting to look cakey on my oily areas. I really wanted to LOVE it and used it consistently for a couple of weeks trying different methods of application, time, etc... Finally, gave up & spending the $ for Smashbox. So far, it's holding up to the hype...even received compliments about something being different about me after using it a couple of days. I just smiled & said thank-you."
4,Fantastic Primer,"The tacky consistency makes this product a PERFECT makeup primer, especially for oily skin. Slippery silicon primers mixed with oily skin is just a mess and makeup tends to slide off the face. The Present allows the makeup to really stick to the face and stay put. I will never use anything else for primer!EDIT:-Downgraded one star after using a different foundation.-Certain foundations, when used with this primer, do not blend well at all (Revlon colorstay in particular for me)."
2,Smashbox Photo Finish's kid sister,"This stuff doesn't hold a candle to Smashbox's Photo Finish primer. I will still use Smashbox for important days, and just use this for other days until I run out, but I won't be buying more. The feeling of The Present is very sticky/tacky whereas Smashbox's Photo Finish goes on like air and then you don't feel it, and makeup is smoother that way. Just wish Smashbox wasn't so expensive."
3,Not good under foundation,"Like some other reviewers, I also experience the problem with putting liquid foundation over this. At first I thought maybe I didn't wait long enough for it to dry, but after waiting at least 30 minutes I applied my liquid foundation. This stuff made my foundation almost not even stick to my skin or even blend well. All these flakes would come off and leave lines all over my face. It was really gross and I have not used this product again. I will probably only use it if I am not going to wear any foundation or possibly try it with mineral foundation."
2,ok....,"Just o.k.....Gives a chalky finish, and seems to clog my pores. Usually a big fan of Philosophy products, but no this one."
3,Just ok,"I bought this as a makeup primer, which it works ok for, but my skin is looking and feeling dry and tight. I moisturize as usual but when I apply my foundation it ""grabs"" after applying the primer. May be better for the summer months."
5,LOVE this stuff.,"I've been using this product for ages, with a little gap in the middle when I was more inclined to use foundation on a daily basis. It does a great job of disguising pores, softening any fine lines, lessening shine, and giving a more even, smooth look. It's not a miracle worker by any means, but for a bit more of a put-together everyday look, I really like it."
4,Moving Forward,"This book is life changing. If you believe in the saying, ""when the student is ready, the teacher will appear"" this is the book for you. After reading the book and applying some of the processes, it has been a life changing experience. Not only for myself, by my children as well. There is a lot to be said about looking within, verses looking outside for a solution. Especially as it relates to your health and emotions. This book will start you on the right track and take you on a journey that will be forever life changing. Thank you Kathy Curry."
1,Do not buy this dvd.,"Dvd is literally only 10 minutes long. That is the combined time for all 8 clips. This should be at the end of some full length feature film as an extra bonus, like they used to give you cartoons before a movie. Not worth the $6.00 I paid with the shipping."
3,Too Fawning,"Mr. Allen is apparently a friend of Ms. Stewart's, and this overly fawning account of her life and times reflects that fact. To my mind, a more balanced, ""warts-and-all"" account of this very interesting woman would have been more satisfying."
1,"Be carefull, readers!","The author happened to meet rather strange characters that make her end up with a pretty inaccurate impressions about the country. I grew up in this country, and I spend half year there every single year, and yet I could not recognize any of the features decsribed in this book. Hence - be carefull, readers. If you are just looking for a ""story"" - the book might be perfectly OK, and it reads well, but please, do not believe it gives you an accurate picture of the country!"
5,ESSENTIAL OVA AND THE ROOTS OF YES,"WHEN THE ENERGY WAS BECOMING THE INSIGHT. THIS IS THE BAND AT ITS FIRST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIMENTATION. YOU CAN HEAR IT IN THE COVER MATERIAL AND VERSIONS YOU'LL SEE WHY THEY STRIPPED AWAY THE ADEQUATE AND CHOSE THE SUPREME HOWE AND WAKEMAN. JON AND CHRIS SHINE ON THIS! THEY FORESHADOW THE ""CLASSIC"" YES HITS - YOU'LL SEE WHY"
4,Good progressive rock,"Time And A Word (1970) was the second Yes album and the last with Peter Banks as guitarist. This 2003 re-issue contains four bonus tracks - ""Dear Father"", ""No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed"" (Original Mix), ""Sweet Dreams"" (Original Mix), and ""The Prophet"" (Single Version). My two personal favorites on this album are ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Astral Traveller"". This album was the last album to feature the original Yes lineup of Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Peter Banks, Chris Squire, and Tony Kaye. Peter Banks was fired after this album was recorded, but before the album was released. He was replaced by Steve Howe.Overall, this is a great album from Yes, the masters of progressive rock. Highly recommended."
2,For Historical Purposes Only,"Time and a Word is a serviceable rock album, and it's worth a listen if only to see where Yes came from. However, Time and a Word features Peter Banks on guitar and Tony Kaye on keyboards (as opposed to Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman), and it lacks what made Yes's later albums great (it is also interesting to note that both Banks and Kaye have subsequently either bashed the band's later efforts [Banks] or sued the band [Kaye]). I bought TAAW hoping to get one or two gems, but I don't think I've listened to it in years."
2,Overblown drama,"Yes is one of those bands that doesn't age very well. Pompous and arty, with not much of a beat. Jon Anderson's voice is pretty annoying too. Even the pop songs like Sweet Dreams are pretty much unlistenable. If you are into exploring the relationship of man and the universe or fathers and sons with dimestore philosophy and dramatic organ music, or need something to listen to while you are playing dungeons and dragons by all means get this record. Otherwise stay away from it!"
5,...and the time is now to buy this CD!,Stronger than the first album in many ways. Their is not a weak track here and the album was recorded with a small orchestra (a la Moody Blues)The remastered CD makes it sound like Tony Kayes Hammond Organ is in your living room!
3,"Not bad, but don't start here","A transitional phase between their excellent and quirky Beatles/Jazz/Psychedelic-influenced debut, and the supergroup they would become with Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman's addition over the next two albums, this is basically the awkward adolescence of the band: plenty of good ideas, but a general lack of focus and direction, and overbearing orchestration doesn't help matters. Not bad at all, but definitely not a good introduction to Yes: pick up (at least) The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge, Going for the One, and their debut before this one."
4,Good if you like early Yes,"This is a good addition to your collection if you like early Yes. It is better than the debut album, but not as good as The Yes Album that followed it. I would get The Yes Album, Fragile and Close to the Edge first if you are building your collection."
4,Underrated!!!,"Rick Wakemen and Steve Howe are better and more talented than Tony Kaye and Peter Banks, but this album is quite good. ""Asteral Traveler"" and ""The Prophet"" are just as good as anything from ""The Yes Album"", but the album has its fair share of weak parts. First of all, the cover is hideous. Whenever Roger Dean wasn't artist for Yes's album covers, the artwork was terrible. Plus, the sound quality stinks.Though not as proggy as later releases, Time and a Word has hints at the style that Yes would take in the future.Great Songs: Asteral Traveler, The ProphetGood Songs: Then, EverydaysAverage Songs: No opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed, Sweet DreamsWeak Songs: Title track, Clear DaysA solid 4 stars. No less, no more."
4,"Steve Howe on ""the Prophet""??","Always loved the bass playing in ""No opportunity"". Between this track and the later ""America"", you get a real idea of how great a band Yes is that they could cover material and make it sound so completely new and charged up.Question for all you Yes Fanatics. I have heard interviews with the band who say that Peter Banks plays guitar on this entire album. However, on ""the Prophet"" the guitar playing sounds so much like Steve Howe that if it weren't I'd eat my hat. Anyone have an opinion?"
5,Hippie Yes.,"This record, a bridge between Yes debut album and the refined Yes Album, sounds kind of strange because the group hadn't achieved its full conjunction and harmony by that date. When I heared it first it sounded like hippie music to me. Nevertheless, it is a quite fine recording, including rhythmic songs like ""No opportunity necessary, no experience needed"", deep and reflexive like ""Then"", and the peace-and-love hymn ""Time and a word"". It's still the original lineup, but that soon changed."
3,Evolutionary Yes,"Yes hit their stride with the album that would follow ""Time and a Word,"" and I suspect I'm not alone in that this album did not find its way onto my turntable, or today into my CD player, as much as ""The Yes Album"" and those that followed. However, if you like Yes, this their second offering is worth having. Without Steve Howe, this band had not quite attained excellence, but there are fine songs here. ""Then"" sounds the most like a classic Yes song and features some excellent bass playing by Chris Squire. ""Astral Traveller"" and ""Time and a Word"" are nice songs. None of the songs drag, they are fine efforts, they just don't attain the greatness of the following albums.The Rhino re-release is excellent. As usual, the Rhino liner notes and improved sound quality make it worthwhile rebuying this album. I recommend this CD for prog rock fans."
5,Enchanting Early Yes,"This Yes album was a favorite of my older brother, back then when it came out we have listened to it many times at home and on 8 tracks while riding in his 1964 Plymouth Valiant. I found that I was thinking about this album recently and decided to get a copy for my library. Very Happy to have it in the musical stable as the charming and magical sounds of early Yes now eminate from my speakers! It is as good as I recall, actually it's even better."
1,It doest help at all,Tony Hawks Underground Official Strategy Guide does not help at all. I beat the game without even looking at it. It was a waste of money.
2,Save Your Money,I thought that this USB headset would be a great solution to my audio needs. It wasn't! The headphones were operative but of poor quality. The microphone didn't work at all.Perhaps I just got a defective unit but I am returning it to Amazon and asking for a refund. I wish Amazon would refund the hundred dollars of my time that I spent trying to get this product to work.
4,Great Deal for That Price,"I bought this item in a very affordable price which is very cheap compared to similar products in the market. The design is as good as it is able to be. And you can use by USB or Analog sound devices as well. Altec Lansing Headphone is just same as a call-center headset, this makes it much cooler for me, that it is very easy to wear it.I cannot say any negative things about it since I made a very good deal with it."
2,Meh,"As a headphone quality isn't bad, even good for the price. Sound is decent (for $10). Rating drops when you factor in the microphone. I had a lot of problems with feedback when the microphone was unmuted. Constant annoying and loud feedback sound and static when microphone is turned ON. But then it's $10 worth so ... meh"
3,50,"I was expecting something different. For example when you watch a film on Carlo Gambino, or the movie ""Paid in Full"", or if you read the book ""Monster"" and ""Sammy the Bull"" you think to yourself, ""WOW, that was amazing how these people operated above the law"". This documentary didn't highlight anything intelligent or witty about this individual...And the portion about the NY BLOODS was kind of silly and embarrassing for blacks.The only thing that I got from this movie was mixed thoughts about the rapper 50. How can he just take a nigga's name like that??? He really didn't seem to have a good explanation. Don't get me wrong he's a good rapper, but the film didn't help his image in my opinion. But who cares......"
4,The TRUTH,"This DVD not only recognizes one of the most famous yet equally infamous drug dealers to come out of New York but also how easy it is to get so tranquilized by what the streets offer in terms of fast money, women, and violence. The film also shows hot quickly this lifestyle can go astray and turn against you and at most times death is the end result. It is very good for the youth today to wathch such a documentary. I definitely recommend this film."
1,Know ur History on Curtis Jackson..,For the idiot that wrote that DAY 1 for fifty was in 2003....stay in da south..ur abviously dont know that fifty has been on the seen since 98 u idoit. ur a fake rap fan and u should know ya history instead of talking on curtis jackson....2003..what a douche bag............
5,This belt is a good substitute for the MTD brand Belt 954-0257 and 754-0257,This belt is a good substitute for the MTD brand auger Belt # 954-0257 and 754-0257 for the MTD 5 horsepower 24 inch snow blower model 317-550-000. And it costs 3.5 times less.
2,Will 50 Cent make it?,"50 Cent may be the hottest artist right now,but will he make it in the future?Only time will tell.There are the first singles from his hot new album 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'.They are very overplayed and after awhile you will get sick of them,so I suggest you should skip this."
2,Average,50 Cent has a direct agenda&He has catchy titles but the Music just seems there to me overall.right now He seems like a Artist rolling more By Association with Eminem&Dr.Dre than a Artist that I Can see having a good Solid run.these Two Songs are Catchy but played to much&He isn't that distinctive enough to me for getting all of this Hype thus far.
5,historic,It's just great to see all these great artists at their best playing really nice songs. Roger Glover did a nice job putting all togheter
4,Screaming Seventies Rock!,"This is the live-in-the-Albert production, with some cute filmed bits in between. The sound quality is quite reasonable, and it's good for a light evening's entertainment. (Alas that they only did the cartoon of ""Love is All"".)It was amusing hearing Sargeant Apone from Aliens sing. He's quite good, in fact. As was Twiggy.Enjoy!"
2,not pleased,Not a single picture of a recipe in this book. The book just has no eye appeal and could not keep me interested. Desserts & appetizers normally draw people in if they look good & so that matters to me.
5,Endings and Beginnings,What a great little book! I love bread pudding and Victoria has included several recipes - all delicious! Nancy's Shrimp Spread is an appetizer to die for!
3,No more WW2 Games!!!!!,"I am getting frickin' tired of these games! If they are going to make another medal of honor game, put new things oh say... BLOOD AND GORE! It's good but no more WW2 games. EA, make a new bloodier medal of honor! no more games with no blood!"
1,dont waste your money,"As a consumer of all the EA Franchise, I was highly disappointed with the latest release. No saving, difficult controls, etc,,,,After attempts to get through various parts of the game, I decided that having to repeat my last 20 min of progress was simply not worth my time. For the first time, I bought the game the day of release. I returned it the next."
1,They Should Have Ignored the Critics,"It looks like EA games put too much stock in reviewers of the previous MOH series. Medal of Honor, Rising Sun, was badgered by complaints of ""no strategy"" and stupid enemy AI. Even still, it became a Playstation 2 ""greatest hits.""Many of us who like FPS games aren't interested in stealth, tactics etc. We want guns, bullets, and more guns. Rather than more complicated game play, this game could have been helped by1.) More intense violence.2.) Bigger, better explosions.3.) More gunfire.4.) Better graphics.Having to keep other troops alive is just a pain in the rear, IMHO. The European theatre is getting old as well. I'd like to see a bigger, better version of what Rising Sun tried to accomplish. That is, fighting in the WWII pacific theatre."
1,they can definitly do better,okay so the graphics are descent but this game irritates me because of the historical inaccuracy. since when was there an american in a British comando unit. and in the africa campaign they would be no way they would ever let an american in to the desert rats. they were completly british. and in russia they didn't even trust the americans never have probably never will. and the game posts no dificulty i beat it an two hours. okay before you say i have no life you should rent it and see how easy it is. its too simple. if you like games where you go around killing things and games that have no point this game is for you.
5,Yet another MOH game,"Hands down the best Medal of Honor game, and probably the best WW2 game. It's a total Call of Duty rip-off, but who cares, the game is more accurate, and Medal of Honor has never been more honorable. Unfortunatley there's no co-op, only in Rising Sun, which is nowhere near as good as this game. Maybe next time we'll get co-op."
2,Worse one of the Medal series,I was really disappointed in this game. For one your squad members never listed to you when you issued a command and they ran around where they pleased. There were hardly any check points in the game and especially in the last level where you played for over a half hour and at the very end if you aren't on the ball and get killed you have to start over again. I like the first medal of honor and I know there a lack of check points there but captures what WWII may have been like. I see that there is a new Medal coming out called Vanguard and hesitant about trying it but will.
1,the kind of game when ya wanna brake the controller,"When i got this game o was so excited as i had played the first medal of honor: Frontline, which was an awesome game, this game is so crappy, it's unbelievable, graphics are N64 compatible, voices are all of sync with the person who's talking, oh and dont even get me started on the controlles for the game, they are so messed up, you will spend half the time you play the game just trying to figure out how to play it, overall this game is just another one of those games that ends up with a broken controller."
2,i picked the wrong item,"in this review,im going to explain why this game is not for me. one thing i would like to say is that i only bought the game for the iron sights. i couldnt find another one that did. i got this game for free 2 cause of swagbucks. this game is aight to mess around with, not a really good game to own, more of a rental, but, its good cause i paid less than 5 bucks for it. mostly on shipping."
3,OK but could be much much better,"When i heard that a new MoH was coming out i had to get it. But really it isn't that great. The graphics are not good at all and are very much like a cartoon than like a game. The whole OSS secret agent going behind enemy lines and killing 100s of nazis is old. But you do get to use a squad to help you out. But its a shame that they usually do absolutely nothing, and end up dead. U can tell that this game was kind of thrown out there to keep up with Call of Duty and all their success, becuz it contains many of the same features. This is the first PS2 MoH game where you look down the sights to aim. Another dissapointment was the multiplayer. The graphics are horribly toned down and the weapons are limited. Rent it, don't buy it."
2,Room for improvment.,"A OK game. The missions are OK. But some of it is complrtrly screwed up. You now have to defeat a bose every level that is 10x more powerful than anything else(he can take like 2 rocket hits.) All the melee attacks are bassicaly the same. And you're squad is made up of people from a retard house. The multiplayer is OK, only if you have LOTS of people. The overal game is alright, but just needs some tweaking."
5,Absolutely Awesome from Beginning to End!!!!,This is the first time I have bought a CD of Lexi. So I didn't know what to expect. WOW!!!! I have such a hard time deciding which song is my favorite. They are all so powerful! I definitely want to see the video! You will be blessed by this project!
2,Alasdair Gray is a great writer - of short stories,"As a writer of prose Alasdair Gray cannot be faulted. The problems begin when he attempts to form that prose into a book. Short stories are his strength and that is what he should stick to; they are the perfect platform for his talent. And that is not in any way to denigrate the talent; that Chekhov wrote short stories is confirmation of that. In his novels Gray just seems to come across as a mucky auld perve. Might be your cup of tea, but it isn't mine."
1,It's a fake.,"This product is not a 3d converter, it's just a double-imager. There is no real 3d, no volumetric effect. You see just a 2d image over the screen. I give to it 1 star 'cause it can show 3d movies, but there are so many product less expensive."
3,Tough Guy Metal,"Take one look at the band photo on this disc's booklet and you know exactly what kind of metal you're gonna get. These denim-clad, pig ugly (seriously - they make Grim Reaper look like pretty boys) metalheads from Belgium obviously love their Motorhead albums. They deliver hard, fast, no-frills metal. You're not going to find any ballads or keyboards here, just straight up fist-pumping heavy metal.It's nothing you haven't heard before, particularly if you own at least one Motorhead album, but Fatal Attraction is still a fun album. Besides, sometimes you just need to hear loud, mindless rock music blaring from your speakers.The Mausoleum Anniversary reissue of Fatal Attraction features 4 bonus tracks taken from guitarist ""Shorty"" Van Camp's solo material."
3,Where's the rocking chair?,"To be honest, I bought the book in hopes that the beautiful rocking chair shown on the cover would be either one of the plans, or at least described in the book ... however it is not. The rest of the book looks ok, but was not my primary reason for buying it."
3,I would not buy again,"for a cheap after shave it's OK, i would not buy again. I was not very impressed with it at all."
4,Smooth skin,"I have three weeks using this butter on face and body, my skin feels smooth. I use it only at night because of the smell. You should give it a try for a nice looking skin."
5,Spaghetti Westerns,"I love this Cd GNAC Twelve sidelong glances. It improves with the listening. Some of it reminds me the of famous composer and conductor Ennio Morricone.He did the sound tracks for the Italian Spaghetti western's and , this Cd has some incredible music that takes you to different places and moods. it also makes you feel like you are in a foreign movie. Great Stuff !!!!!"
4,Is actually larger than appears in image,"I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice functional lamp for my bedside table which wasn't too cookie cutter yet didn't break the bank. Usually I end up gravitating towards the tiffany style lamps but I didn't wanna do it this time. This lamp is great in the sense that it's different from regular lamps, has a bit of character, yet is nice and bright. And it's actually a little larger than expected for me. If I was getting even a regular lamp, by the time you add up the lamp base, the shade and the fittings the price comes out to be only slightly different if not more. So this seemed like a bargain price for me. There's talk about the separate switch in the other reviews but frankly I don't mind it, I actually prefer it because I don't need to reach inside the lamp to turn it off or on. But if it's an important factor for you keep it in mind before buying."
2,Beautiful design. Poor quality.,"This lamp was exactly what I was looking for in size and design so I ordered it in spite of the warnings of poor quality in earlier reviews. I had hope the manufacturer had also read feedback and corrected the problem. The lamp arrived with a leaning, swinging post as described by others. My husband already has the felt pad removed and is attempting to fix it. So if you want a ""project"" lamp , go to a flea market. I do not recommend this product or price."
1,Good luck,"Poor quality, had amazon send me two and every one of them in some way was damaged or defective. They even sent me a replacement and had the same issues... but the lamp looks good if you get a good one!!"
4,delicate beauty and historical charm,"I have read over 100 Arthurian novels, and Sharan Newman's ""Guinevere"" trilogy is in my top 10 list. This book presents a detailed view of Romano-Celtic Britain, yet manages to keep the magical aspects of the cycle. Cynics will not enjoy it, as the first volume details Guinevere's childhood and friendship with a unicorn sent to watch her by the Horse Goddess, Epona. Many of the secondary characters are lovingly detailed (particularly Gawain, Risa, and Guenlian), and Newman's Arthur is charmingly uncertain of himself and his role. Several readers I know have been put off by the ""precious"" element of the unicorn: don't be. It isn't all hearts and flowers in this book, and Newman manages a story that is sweet without being too cloying. I also recommend the other two volumes: ""The Chessboard Queen"" and ""Guinevere Evermore""."
3,An average story,"I bought all three of the Guinevere books based on the posted reviews, and I was rather disappointed. I did get through all three, but I don't see what there was to love in the stories. The books had some nice moments, but I found Guinevere too self-unaware. She seemed to move through the events with little understanding or reflection.I did enjoy the magical elements such as the Lady of the Lake, which I thought was a fresh approach, but overall, the triology didn't offer much new or interesting. Parke Godwin's and Bernard Cornwell's books are much better!"
2,Too simplistic,"I found this book a bit to simplistic. The writing was rather...basic. I would have found this book simple enough for a young teenager to read. I just didn't feel that the talent was there in comparison to Miles, McKenzie, Cornwell and Zimmer-Bradly. The story gets across, but it is filled with silly childish things like the unicorn - a total waste of pages. I also found the development of characters like Caet, Flora and the brother and sister living alone in the wilderness are all very poorly done. I didn't ""KNOW"" them and therefore, their motivation for doing things was also not well understood.If you are looking for a fast read (short book) and like the Arthurian legends - you may find some interest here. However, there are about 10 books I'd suggest before this one."
4,Grendel,"The book Grendel, written by John Gardener, tells the story of when Grendel began his life pondering all of life's mysteries. Experiencing pain, sorrow, and happiness, Grendel develops a character all his own. Slowly, as Grendel grows older, he explores more and more of his surrounding area until he finally encounters humans. As Grendel watches the trials and tribulations of the humans, he becomes more and more disgusted with the pitiful creatures until he finally wages war on Hrothgar's hall.""Grendel"" is an amazing story written from the point of view of the villain in the classic novel, ""Beowulf."" Written in the same medieval style as ""Beowulf,"" ""Grendel"" gives the reader insight into the mind of the monster. Written by John Gardner, who was a phenomenal professor of medieval literature and ancient languages, ""Grendel"" is a must read for all classic literature fans."
4,ironic and tongue in cheek with just one flaw,"The one star ranters here really need to lighten up. Grendel, if anything, is a bit of a professor's put-on in the vein of Nabokov's ""Pale Fire"". Both are ironic, very self-conscious and cleverly written in an academic sort of way. The one real flaw in Grendel is the character of the dragon. His ""character"" doesn't really jell and sometimes the whole mask of the novella begins to slip a bit with his omniscient ramblings. Most of what he says Grendel could come up with himself with a little effort. It seems to me that the dragon would have been better portrayed as the arch materialist that at bottom he is in contrast to Grendel's existential whining and the humans' drunken violence mixed with pathetic transcendental longings."
2,Completely Overrated,"This book, like others before it (such as Ishmael) has attempted to use modern literature as a guise to pass on its author's nihilistic and/or otherwise incoherent religious beliefs. I cannot stand that. It does earn points, however, for its completely original style of writing. It also has some pretty gory scenes (such as people's arms getting ripped off) which, in my book, gets a star or two. Other than these two things, the book is completely worthless. Not even the plot is original. It is a twist on a medieval folk tale."
1,Boring!,"Blech. I REALLY didn't liked this book. I've had it since my junior year of high school, from when we readBeowulf (Signet Classics)and I think I bought it to read for extra credit, or because I had genuinely likedBeowulf (Signet Classics)... but I never got around to reading this book. We rented the movieBeowulfand afterward, I decided to pull this book off the shelf. I found it to be very boring... so boring, in fact that I almost didn't finish it. Maybe if I had readBeowulf (Signet Classics)more recently... well, I don't know, but really, it was boring! It was hard to get involved in the story and mostly all it made me want to do was to pullBeowulf (Signet Classics)off the shelf and read that instead!"
1,Terrible Book,"I thought this book would be kinda cool to read since I'm a big fan of Beowulf and have read it several times. Man was I wrong. The writing is terrible. Grendel isn't a monster, he's a cry baby. A story from the ""other perspective"" has so much potential, but this author didn't use any of it. After reading this book, I wondered if John Gardner read Beowulf at all."
1,Yawn...this thing is a bust,"I am a huge fan of John Gardner and was ready to give this one a great review...but the book was awful.Whiney, petulant, boring, this has none of the verve and excitement of the original.It was a bit like reading a two year old Rosencrantz's version of Hamlet. He doesn't understand what's going on, can't articulate anything more than a whiny pout, and is such pitiful substitute for the original that you wonder why he was in the original at all."
1,Grendel: Not for everybody,"Although the author's idea to write a story in the view point of the ""bad guy"" is a good and interesting one, I must admit I thought the book was rather boring. Half asleep, I had to read lines and sometimes paragraphs over and over again, and in many cases (even when I managed to stay awake through this grueling novel), I still couldn't not quite understand what the author was trying to say. I'm not saying this book is terrible, I just don't think this book was for me. (You must understand I was required to read this book for my English class, and I don't usually agree with what I am forced to read.)"
5,great book.,"this book is awesome! i have read it more than 4 times and each time it gets a little bit better and i understand more and more. Grendel is a violent, sadistic character who has occasional outbursts of insanity. i fell in love with Grendel at first read. this book is graphic, bloody, and funny. i recommend it to anyone, in fact im doing a book report on it. if anyone likes gory novels, this is for you."
1,This books blows a huge one....,"Utterly disappointing I wasted 5 hours of my life reading this book. It is just repeated stuff. Grendel's feelings and other things stated in the book are so inconsistent to the original Beowulf legend. It was so dragged on. You can read the first chapter and skip to the last and not have missed anything at all, you would get the same effect."
3,A new point of view,"Gardner's story retells the traditional legend from a new point of view - Grendel's own. Don't dismiss this as just another fairy tale retold, like 'Wicked.' For one thing, the 1971 copyright predates more familiar titles in that vein by several decades.For another, it makes literate reference to real people and places, as described the Icelandic sagas. Gardner is well aware of the uneasy times between Viking barbarism and Norse rule of law, just before Christianity invaded the North Sea. They form the backdrop against which Grendel plays out his story.That educated literacy may be the book's biggest weakness, though. The Grendel myth isn't widely read these days, and Gardner's story lacks much for a reader not already familiar with it. The Saga times aren't widely familiar, either. Many readers may get a feeling like the one that says it's a pretty good joke, but you've missed the punchline.//wiredweird"
1,1 star,"ok this book is just too weird for me too read. i never knew it would be so gruesome. i can't believe i pick this book for summer readin book for skool. well, let just say that i hope i pass this test."
3,disappointed,"Maybe I went into this expecting more but I found this novel to be quite short and disappointing. The story has no direction and basically just follows Grendel through various scenes. Obviously Gardner had to follow the story of Beowulf but the ending is so fast that it leaves you wondering what the point of the whole book was. Grendel was interesting and exciting at times, but when you see that the excitement leads to nothing, it leaves you a bit questionable of what the overall story is. Overall Im glad I read this to see what the hype was about, just wish there was more to it."
3,Grendel,"I enjoyed reading Grendel more than Beowulf. Its much more interesting and had more of a plot to follow. Each chapter seemed to have a different theme, for example chapter sevens theme was value. Unlike in Boewulf, always having their boasts. In Grendel there was always a battle or some sort of action to keep me intriged. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys constant battles and action, underlying themes."
5,An Amazing tale... Its as simple as that,"After sitting here at my computer for a half of an hour trying to think of the way that I can properly articulate my feelings about this great book, I have decided that no words that I can say would do GRENDEL justice. From the moment that I picked this book up, I did not want to put it down. Gardner does an incredible job of bringing to life characters that have been in rest for centuries. Gadner is equally successful at forcing me to feel compassion for one of history's greatest monsters, Grendel. Each paragraph makes the reader feel more and more for the beast who is just, like all of us, looking for a friend, and our place in the world. However, unlike the rest of us, Grendel has been doomed to have no place in this world, except for that of a monster. This book has everything a reader needs and wants from a story. Everyone should read GRENDEL, by John Gardner."
4,LONELINESS IS A MONSTER,"I read this book for the first time in high school of all places. I later bought my own copy and reread it four or five times since. Very weird and depressing and there are still parts of it I don't quite get. But it is a very powerful book. As you might have guessed by the title, it tells part of the Beowulf epic from the monster's point of view. Grendel is sensitive and lonely but unable to acquire friends or companions, mainly because humans attack or run at the sight of him. In time he grows to hate them and reciprocates their hostility and that's when the trouble starts. Yes, the main character is a hideious survival from a forgotten age and there's plenty of violence, but this is really about a desperate soul lost in a cruel world not of his own making. As with the original version, I was rooting for Grendel the whole time.James Pratt, author of 'When Dead Gods Dream - A Collection of Lovecraftian Short Stories'"
5,WOW,"Grendel is a wonderful novel written by John Gardner. It takes on a point of view of the monster Grendel from the Beowulf epic. It starts before Grendel meets man and tells the relationship between Grendel, men, and nature. There is a lot of symbolism of our flaws in our everyday lives, religion, and communication. This is a good novel for anyone who is ever having questions about life and what we represent in life."
4,Grendel,"Spinning-off from human history's original epic, Grendel tells the story from the monster's perspective. Philosophical, humorous and very well thought out, Grendel raises captivating questions. Deceptively complex, Grendel depicts the life struggle of innocence and experience, structure and chaos, purpose and chance, throughout the ages of time and existence. Who knew Beowulf's monster was so deep?"
5,More than just a story,"Grendel is one of my favorite novels. Besides being a creative story about the tale of Beowulf from the ""monster's"" point of view, it explores many subjects. Good vs. Evil, caring for a senile parent, temptation, Life and Death, history, oral tradition, greed, war, and many more.Gardner does a masterful job of weaving all of these themes together, and somehow still gets us to feel sympathy for Grendel. For anyone who is interested in mythology and folklore, this novel is a must read."
3,Alright.....,I bought this book after reading Beowulf. I must say I like that one better than Grendel. This is an interesting point of view from Grendel. I now have a better understanding on what his life was like and really what any other beast or wild animal's life is like. It was just hard for me to sit and read through the whole thing. It got a little boring at times.
3,Entertaining,"John Gardner's Grendel takes the antagonist, Grendel, from the epic poem Beowulf and gives his side of the story. Grendel gets an actual personality in this novel. He has feelings, interests, and desires. He is interested in humans and, more than anything, tries to understand how and why things work the way that they do. Through Grendel's eyes, the novel makes some interesting observations about human nature and folly. However, above all, this novel is entertaining. Grendel is such a novice that you can't help but laugh out loud at him sometimes. I would definitely recommend this novel, whether you have read Beowulf or not."
2,Wish I had liked this one.,"I was so excited when I saw this book at the library. I thought the concept of the story seen from Grendel's eyes was a fascinating one. But, I was unable to get into the story after 2 chapters. I'm not sure why, but the author was unable to connect with me and make me care about this Grendel...well, how do you care for a troll you might ask...well, I didn't even dislike him enough to keep going...does that make it clearer? Again, not sure why it didn't grab me. I wish it had."
5,"A Monster, His Mother, and The Meaning Of Life","I found John Gardener's Grendel to be a very good read. It was the kind of book that you could just read, and leave it at that, or you could also go deep into it and discuss it in a book club kind of setting. In discussing the book you get the point that sometimes you have to look at things from the other person's perspective. The main character, a monster of unknown origin, is struggling as he explores the world around him and realizes life's harsh and brutish reality. The book really makes you think about your own view of life and humans. I recommend this book to anyone who has a love for good literature, internal conflict, with a bit of philosophy and a dash of blood."
4,Wonderful Retelling of the Old Beowulf Story,I found this novel funny and enlightening. I loved the monster's humor and the role the Shaper has in setting him straight. This is a wonderfully told story that will keep you entertained and make you think a little.
2,Read right after Beowulf maybe?,"I tried and tried to get into this to no avail. Maybe if I read it years ago, immediately after reading 'Beowulf', it would have captured me. But reading it years after that, I just found it unimpressive."
2,Hardcover is a Ripoff.,"Great book, but don't waste your money on the hardcover: it is a paperback edition pasted (not bound) into a hard cover. Save your money, buy the paperback."
5,Great Starting Point,"I knew I wanted to buy a business, but ""Where do I start?"" This book is an outstanding starting point! It is well-organized, thorough, and yet easy to understand--but not overly basic. It helped answer my questions of: ""What skills do I need to hone in order to succeed?"" ""How much cash do I need and what price range can I realistically pursue?"" ""What professional contacts will I need?""...and on that note, it helps you toward being able to talk the legal and financial talk and know where to ""keep an eye on"" your professional advisors going forward. Thanks to this book as my outline, I now have an actionable plan. I believe I can really do this!"
5,BEST OF THREE BOOKS,IN 1997 I BOUGHT THREE BOOKS IN ORDER TO BRUSH UP ON BUYING A BUSINESS. THIS WAS THE BEST OF THE THREE.THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHICH HAPPENED IN 2005 FELL THROUGH AND THE SELLER SOLD TO HIS EMPLOYEE.I HAVE REREAD SOME OF THE CHAPTERS AS I AM ENTERING ANOTHER PURCHASE. THIS BOOK COVERS MANY MORE ITEMS WITH MORE DETAIL THAN THE OTHER TWO BOOKS I HAVE. THE BOOK STANDS THE TEST OF TIME.
4,Great Introduction to Buying A Business,"I'm starting a career in business brokerage and looked to this book for knowledge on the subject. It did not disappoint. It is well written and very informative. I liked the fact that the authors are real life business owners/investors speaking from first hand knowledge, not theory. The book was published in 1992 and needs an update. I hope they do because I would definitely buy it."
2,"I'm a fan of the Rads, but not this CD / album.","I have seen the Radiators live about half a dozen times and I always have a GREAT TIME. So why is it that their live recordings never give me that same feeling? IMO, it is because the recordings always sound dull, and lifeless - just like this CD. I don't know if it is the actual performance or just a poor effort by the recording engineer. I tend to think the latter.Thing is, I really don't like ANY of the live material put out by the band, including on DVD.I'm guessing that to truly enjoy the Radiators ""Live"", you really have to be there. And that is a shame, because I totally enjoy seeing them in concert."
1,everybody must have it.,"I AM TIMBIRICHE GENERATION BOY, AND EDITH MARQUEZ WASN'T MY FAVORITE IN TIMBIRICHE GROUP,BUT AFTER I HEARD THIS CD,NOW I'AM FAN OF HER STRONG AND UNIQUE VOICE.THE SONG SELECTIONS ARE EXCELLENT;THE STYLE IS AWESOME. GOOD FOR EDITH MARQUEZ WHO GAVE US A 5 STARS CD AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, HER BEUTIFUL-STRONG VOICE"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This book was not what I thought it was and was highly disappointing. I should have rented it from the library first. I bought Dr. Earl Mindell's Prescription Alternatives and LOVED it (buy that book instead). The info in the book is not detailed enough for me. A lot of times it recommends you to take something like ""barberry: as directed on label."" This does not give me any info. What is barberry? How do you take it? So I would have to go to the store, look it up, and basically do my research at the store. I hate this book. Skip it and buy his other book instead. This is a worthless waste of money that doesn't help at all."
2,"Positive message but not very ""Christian""","My 3 year old loves Pahappahooey Island and all the characters, but I expected more of a Christian message from Joyce Meyer. Instead, the only reference to God is when Joyce Meyer's character (""Ms. Rubie"") tells the children they can face their fears because ""the Creator is with you and I am too"". Then the whole rest of the movie the kids talk about how Ms. Rubie is with them and how Ms. Rubie said they can face their fears when they ""do it afraid"". Nothing more about God. Joyce seems to replace God with her own character. While this is an entertaining movie, I'll be looking for something with more of a Christian message like Veggie Tales or some of the Max Lucado movies (GREAT cartoons and an excellent God-centric message) and I probably won't buy Joyce's stuff again."
2,Not so great,"The topic is great. The participant's guide is a stretch in relating to Proverbs and we wonder at times ""How did she come up with this?"", so you have to make your own connections. The video is only fair as the leader is not engaging and very difficult to watch her mouth move. We probably won't buy any more from this series as we rate it only ""fair"". The leader's guide has some questions for discussion, but not enough connections to the scriptures."
4,Sisters Bible Study,I enjoyed the bible study. It gives you a lot to think about. For the ones who want a deeper study it is good.
2,Same Old Same Old,I totally agree with the spotlight reviewers review above. I have read ALL of Mr. Edward's books. When they first came out they were exciting. But this one is a REPEAT of all the others. I guess since they canceled his series he needed to make a buck fast.
2,Disappointing At Best,"I found this book disappointing at best. Somehow reading this book I got the feeling that this was the same old same old rehashed. I can't think of a thing I learnt from it, nor was it very entertaining. So what's the point to reading it?I hope that John is not taking his que from Sylvia Brown & trying to mass produce books for the buck. I would much rather read one good quality book from someone in this field once a year than three books of fluff. I am giving him 2 starts for somewhat of an effort."
5,A good read and food for thought,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is a good read and food for thought. I have seen John Edward on Larry King several times and even Larry King, a professed agnostic, as am I, admits to being impressed with him. There are good stories and insights in this book. As an agnostic, I don't believe or disbelieve, but I KEEP AN OPEN MIND. I read a review here by a skeptic who is passionately closed-minded on the topic. How sad."
3,A review on this book.,"This book left me wanting to know more. It just didn't go as deep as I felt it could have, or should have."
3,"Sorry, this book doesn't do it",I like Tiffany Snow's books better. I like Sylvia Browne's books better. I like James van Praagh's books better. Sorry John. I liked Crossing Over better.
4,Heart warming prose from a real Psychic,John is the real deal. I have no doubt.I enjoyed this book so much.John's writing style is warm and engaging and the stories he relates are always inspiring and heartwarming.I can't wait to read his other books.
5,Not a Fake,"John Edward is not a fake! The amazon site is not supposed to be a bashing of the authors, but rather a site for critiquing books. I hope in the future, people will stick to this idea.Re:After Life the book: John Edward presents a wonderful book with many intersting insights written clearly and concisely. He is a gifted writer who is able to convey his ideas to all the readers in a manner that is simple yet detailed. I highly recommmend this book and hope that others will open their eyes to the insights of John Edward.As an aside: John Edward readily admits that his name is John Edward McGee and that he chose not to use his father's last name when he became famous. His life is an open book, and I can attest to his abilities from a live reading I witnessed. There were no tricks or editing tools for the live reading. The details he gives are astounding and very truthful. He is someone we can all learn from, whether we believe in his abilities or not."
5,Inspiring and honest,"John Edward cuts right to the heart of skeptics, believers, and what and how he hears from the other side. I am a huge fan, but was particularly struck by John's behind the scenes look at his own life and the lives around him as the other side makes it's case.I could not put the book down until I was finished!"
5,John Edward...Fabulous!,"I practically ABSORBED this book through my skin...I couldn't put it down and was fascinated and totally obsessed with each story he told of his journey into mediumship. Nicely written, honest, great book."
3,A little disappointed,"I think John Edward is genuine, and I loved ""One Last Time."" But I found this book to be a little tedious. It contains too many long transcripts of his readings. They go on and on and on. I've been reading it when I have trouble falling asleep."
4,An Oldie and a Goodie,"I bought the vinyl of this when it first came out a bunch of years ago. The Harlem Nocturn is a must listen! It's amazing what a stir Danny and the Fat Boys created in the D.C. metro area back then. Roy Bucannan was playing down at ""My Mothers Place"", Danny was playing around at various venues, it was exciting, especially for a guitar-phile like myself. This album may not be one of the best he ever put out, but...it was one of the first. He was explosive then, and his vintage improved with the passing years. If you collect, get this. I picked up the CD after the LP wore out."
1,The show is great - the DVD release is shocking,"I've been looking forward to this one for a long while, but what a disappointment.Season 5 of Reba was broadcast in widescreen, but the episodes are presented here in 4:3 - that is inexcusable. Add to that the squeezing of 22 episodes onto 2 discs. The discs are double-sided, with seven episodes on one side and four on the other. The picture quality on the seven-episode sides is dreadful. The set itself consists of the two discs and a flyer - no episode guide at all.Fox really shouldn't have bothered if this is the best they can do. I'll stick with watching the broadcast versions I have."
5,Very Funny,These Reba Series just keep getting funnier and funnier. My only disappointment is that now I have to wait for the 6th season to come out so I can buy it.
3,Reba season 5,"Bought the last two season for my niece, she loves the show. I personally think its for the younger crowd because I dont find it funny what so ever. We snatched it up at a good price and shipping was VERY fast."
1,INANE AND NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"I should know better. I came across this at yard sale for $2:00 and mere curiousity made me buy it...hoping that with experiece.....and time...this show had improved. Alas.....worse than ever.....McEntire's acting is way too over-the-top thereby eclipsing her supporting cast. The stories are mediocre, vapid, lukewarm but mostly dull. What a blessing the show was cancelled! I'm selling this at MY next yard sale."
4,A Promising Beginning,"Tyce Sanders is your average 14-year-old kid. Except for one thing. He just happens to be the only kid on the experimental station on Mars. In fact, he was born on Mars and has never been to Earth. However, when the station starts getting low on oxygen, he and the others may not live to see the next supply shuttle. Tyce must use his knowledge and virtual reality skills to solve the problem.Sigmund Brouwer has created a promising character in Tyce. I was most interested to learn of Tyce's disability. The setting is realistic sci-fi, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of this world. My only disappointment was in character development. Tyce, as narrator, is well developed, but the other characters are overlooked. A little longer book would have helped with this, but I'm sure with the base of this book, other chapters in the series will add to the other characters, too."
5,Not your average book,"I really liked Rushing to Paradise and I don't see how it generated such negative reviews; except to say that it IS a ""politically incorrect"" book. Author Ballard has strange, almost hallucinatory descriptive powers which he delivers in cool, matter of fact language. Above all, the book resonates with a twilight of the gods atmosphere. Maybe not for everyone, but this doesn't make it a bad book. Quite the contrary."
3,"not his best, but it is James!","I have read several of Ballard's books, and many of his favorite ideas are here: tyranny, the cult of personality, ""the kindness of women"" (a real joke, that), destruction of environment, the violence of the mob, etc. etc. but I got the impression he was just going through the motions--it was very similar in concept to the last chapter of HIGH RISE, which I liked better.As a woman who barely survived a 70's radical feminist ""collective""/communal household, though, I found his evocations of aggressive, politically-minded women together quite frighteningly real!"
2,What a clunker!,"Rushing To Paradise reads more like a sub-par novel from Michel Houellebecq or Alex Garland and pales in comparison to almost every other J.G. Ballard title. This one far and away is the worst of the lot. It's not that the writing is bad or that the plot is terrible. It's just that NOTHING ever really goes anywhere, the characters are two-dimensional even more so than is common in Ballard books. In most Ballard books we are confronted with a ""normal, professional"" person subjected to some sort of extraordinary situation that reveals something about humanity and the world that we live in or one day might find ourselves in. However, in Rushing To Paradise we are given no chemistry for this process to happen. The characters and location never really click making any revelation impossible. Skip this one and read the shortTerminal Beachinstead, similar set up with a compelling insight that is utterly lacking in this novel."
2,Not What I expected,"This book was not at all what I expected. It was not for young children first off. They were totally confused and had not interest in ever reading it again. It also did not give as much information about the reason we celebrate Christmas as I had expected. I'm not even keeping this book, I'm giving it away. The only reason I gave it two stars is because they tried to make a book about the real reason for Christmas."
2,"DANGER, Will Robinson, DANGER","WARNING: Look carefully at the title listed above before ordering. Amazon is listing the same reviews for both Maier's ""The First Christmas"" and his children's book ""The Very First Christmas."" ""The First Christmas"" is NOT the children's book ""The Very First Christmas"" as suggested in most of the reviews and Amazon's own description. It is actually a book for adults. It is an interesting archaeological study of the story of Christmas, but it is NOT a children's book."
4,Great kids book,Bought book based on sermon illustration and authors history. Kids book versus adult oriented. Well done for ages 8 to 10. Will pass on to the grandkids.
4,Elyria- Iago's Demise,"I bought this cd for one song, Iago's Demise, and ended up liking the majority of them. Even my boyfriend likes it and he doesn't usually like female vocalists. I will be purchasing more of Faith and the Muse."
3,Where is Elizabeth?! This sounds like the Cocteau Twins!,"I know the Cocteau Twins were way ahead of their time and they influenced many many bands. So, maybe I shouldn't feel insulted by Faith & the Muse. Isn't Imitation a form of flattery?"
5,Needs a sixth star,"Are there new things to say about the game of bridge that can be articulated and of practical use to the aspiring player? Michael Rosenberg proves there are. He resolutely refuses to tackle the mundane or already said; his ideas bristle with verve and originality. This from one of the few who can lay claim to being the world's greatest card-player. Whether he is discussing ethics, reminiscing, or laying bare the raw but brilliant deductive technique with which he plays the game, Rosenberg is scintillating. I urge you to buy this book, then look at his series of articles on his thought processes during the World Par Tournament, published in the US magazine, Bridge Today. You will be astonished."
3,"Not the best, Not the worst","The photographs include some not seen in the many other books on Kahlo, which is the primary strength of this book. However, it seems that some of the facts are drawn from the March biography of Rivera - which is at best questionable - and at worst Rivera's mythical reinterpretation of his own life. The unusual grammar and typographical errors are somewhat distracting at times. Overall, however, it provides a nice overview of the important points in the Kahlo-Rivera relationship."
5,very pleased,"I received the DVD in very good time, and it was in better shape than I was expecting from the description. It was a Christmas present so I was very happy about both of those things. I was, in short, very pleased with my purchase and would definitely purchase from this seller again."
1,"Good God, this SUCKED.","Scott, keep WALKING, as FAR away as you can get from ever writing another book. You can't recap, your rants suck, and you get all pissy and whiny whenever anyone has a problem with anything you say or do. This is the worst book I have ever read, in any genre, including Chyna's book. Rantsylvania - We Really Do Suck."
1,What a pile of Monkey Dung!,"Memo to Scott Keith:There is new technology called spell check!! And check your facts before you put them in a book. God this book is no where as entertaining as your website Scott, should have thought keeping things in the same style. Readers should find another book to buy to enlighten them on Pro wrestling."
2,What's the point?,"The biggest flaw I see is that it doesn't really go in one direction. It goes into pre-RAW WWF and NWA, but doesn't hit on a lot of key parts. It never touches Japan, which is truly sad. And there is no section for ECW, yet there is one for the AWA.My only question is, what was the point of the book? Was it to introduce fans to today's wrestling market? If so, why mention older wrestlers and why not use that space to talk about ECW and some other WWF and WCW stars?If the point was to introduce people to wrestling altogether, then why not talk about Japan and ECW?The constrictive nature of a ""how to"" series book won't allow as many pages as is needed to do this project justice. So perhaps Scott should've waited until he didn't have to rely on a series in order to publish a book."
1,What crap,This book is so horribly written that I couldn't finish it. It had very little insight and drags on. It is a boring and unoriginal. I hope that Mr. Kieths writing stops here. What a pathetic attempt at trying to cash in on the recent popularity of professional wrestling. This is just a picture book with bland writing. Stay away from this book at all costs!
1,Beyond horrible.,The book is a generic fluff piece with a few cheesy publicity photos thrown in to spruce it up. Scott Keith's writing style is a cross between incoherent prose and outright gibberish. I'd advise everyone to avoid this book at all costs.
2,The RSPW FAQ,"If you have ever read the FAQ for rec-sports-pro-wrestling then you have read this book. Many parts of the book seem to have been lifted word for word from the FAQ. I am usual a fan of Scott Keith's work, but this book was terrible disappointing. It's not worth the money and definately not worth the torture it takes to get through this book."
3,"Good, but provided me with no new information","Let me start this review off by saying that I have an enourmous amount of respect for Scott Keith, writer of the book, who also owns and writes for Rantsylvania.com. By reading The Buzz On Professional Wrestling you can see that he's a big fan and that he cares about his writing. But some things really set me off from really liking this book. Little things like called Curt Hennig KURT Henning. And one thing that I didn't like was the picture things like #1 Babyface (picture of a baby's face) + #1 Heel (picture of a heel of a foot)= money. I knew everything that Scott presented, though I found the book hard to put down and read the whole book in a couple hours. If you don't know much about wrestling, I'd very much reconmend the book for you to read, and study."
2,WHERE'S MY FEMUR?,"This book would have been 100x better if it had more of my tag team, The Moondogs, featured in it. We are the pioneers of junk wrestling. More USWA in general would have been appreciated. Also, an explanation of the Owen Scale would have been appreciated, because I've heard about it, but nobody's ever deemed me worthy enough to explain it. I don't need to hear about Hulk Hogan - I was wrestling back before he was out of high school.Put me in the next book, or I will beat you with my chair that has my name (SPOT) written on it. I am not joking."
5,THE BEST BOOK ON WRESTLING BAR NONE,"This is the greatest wrestling book ever written. It's an amazing history and an awesome chronicle of the most fascinating parts of sports entertainment. The one reviewer who trashed this book is obviously bitter because he's a no talent, Cheez-Whiz sucker who can't string two sentence together to even write a decent review. Wake up, loser, this is the book you've always wanted to write. Great job to the authors of this Buzz On book. It's incredible!"
5,Second Best Book on Wrestling Ever!,"Never mind the nasty/joke reviews written here. They're written by bitter cretins who will never, *ever* get book deals on their own, and only *wish* they had written this.Yes, there are numerous typos that are entirely the fault of the publisher who inexpliacbly did the book on a rush schedule. These are in no way the fault of the author, as anyone who knows anything about publishing will tell you.As for the book itself, it's a great overview of the business over the past 50 years that reads like THE GODFATHER meets Meltzer. Keith is hilarious and you're guaranteed to learn something here. This is simply the best book to get you up to speed on the real goings on behind the scenes--and these stories are often more dramatic and entertaining than what you see in the ring. The only better book about wrestling is Foley's book.Whether you're a longtime rantsylvania.com fan or just a neophyte smart mark wannabe, you must BUY THE BOOK!"
1,This book is great....for me to poop on.,"I got a ton of laughs out of this book...not because Scott Kieth is witty, because he's nowhere near it. I was laughing at the horrible proofreading and the numerous factual errors I spotted in the 5 minutes of my life (that I will never get back) I spent looking at this ""book."" Lou Albano's terrible book was more informative than this dung heap. Nice of Kieth's 10 friends to spend the time making up positive reviews, though."
3,Yikes,"What happened. I have always enjoyed Scott Keith's entertaining, though opinionated, rants on his website. The writing style used in ""The Buzz on Wrestling"" is COMPLETELY different. It is stilted, contrived, and excessively verbose. Much like this review. On his site, his style is natural and easy to read. Maybe the authors were trying to impress someone with their mastery of the English language. Unfortunately, this does not happen. The impression I got was that the book was rushed, as their are glaring errors of style and grammar. This type of sloppiness should never have made its way into a professional publication. You would think that a professional editor would have tidied it up, as the mistakes stick out like Doink the clown at a funeral"
1,Do not buy,"This book was horrible. He completely discredited any of the ""bigger"" wrestlers, even though that's who fans come to see. This guy is also a know idolizer of Vince McMahon, so anyone reading this will simply get a one-sided view. Not worth your time..."
1,AUGH!@#$%,"Highlights for Children is a more intellectual read than the book Scott ""I'm the biggest mark around"" Keith put together."
3,don't attack me for this!!!,"ok, try not to get too angry at me for this. i guess i just can't say the same as most people about this album. i really do think it's a good cd and took a lot of time and effort to be made, but i just can't seem to like it nearly as much as Yourself or Some One Like You, which is one of the greatest rock cd's i own. they've become a little too soft/pop/manufactured sounding. no doubt, matchbox 20 still rocks, but not like they used to."
5,Still Evolving,"Wow! Matchbox Twenty has done it again! Beginning as a complete surprise as a smash success in the mid-90s with their debut Yourself Or Someone Like You, then blending many different sounds into Mad Season in 2000, the band continues to evolve with their most recent CD. More Than You Think You Are brings a more collective flavor and range of feelings from Matchbox Twenty. From the traditional rock sound of Feel to the quirky Unwell, Rob Thomas's songsmithing journeys onward in new directions with welcome additions from writings by other band memebers. I enjoy every song on this CD. And Hand Me Down touches my heart about being an adopted person. I am planning to put together a workshop for a conference next that will be inspired by that song. Thanks for the opportunity to sound off!"
5,Matchbox Twenty Hits it Big With Current Release...,"Matchbox Twenty's recent release 'More Than You Think You Are' could possibly be their best release to date. All 12 tracks plus the bonus track is amazing. 'The Difference' is a sweet love song that just takes you in and mesmerizes you as Rob Thomas sings his heart out. From the hard beats of the first track 'Feel' to the end of the record, the music will have you wanting more from these guys. The unwinding and mellow 'Unwell' is possibly the best song on the album. The song is simply great and the album is more than expected."
5,Spot on!,"All the tracks on this CD have something disticntive about them. Yet they all are unmistakably Matchbox 20 (MB20). Over time you will tend to listen to some tracks more than others, and eventually you'll realize that all the tracks are great!The slow melanchoic sounds of Unwell and Bright lights, contrast very nicley with songs like Disease. Songs that cover all aspects of everyday life, (spare the ones that artists like Marylin Manson and Korn cater to!)Great addition to the collection if you're a MB20 fan or not. I started with ""Mad Season"" and subsequently bought ""Yourself or someone like you"" before this released. They're a great band ... the most amazing aspect of this band is that thier lead singer (rob thomas) writes most of the music as well.. and yet does not play any! definatley one of the things that make you go ""hmmmmm...""!5 on 5 for this one! great album!"
5,simply the best,"This has got to be simply the best album matchbox twenty have done so far. love Disease, Bright Lights, ADORE downfall. There is not a single song I don't like or won't listen to. Great for chillin . Got album in my car haven't played anything else since it's been in. excellent album."
5,I missed that one..,"I purchased this album in june 2004 and honestly, I have no idea why I did not get it when it was released in 2002.. It is one of the best pop-rock album I've heard in the last 10 years. Rob Thomas has an incredible voice, the band is great, it's just one of the few albums that I can actually listen to and not skip any songs. A must-have for any pop-rock fans!"
3,good but not great,"This cd is nowhere near as strong as MB20s debut cd ""Yourself Or Something Like You""This cd basically has two good songs, Bright lights and Unwell.Everything else is just ok, not bad but not great.I know that it is hard for a band to stay fresh and very few bands can improve or maintain after their debut cd. This cd is ok but not great and not bad.This cd is a good value used, but not a good value at the $14 I paid for it."
5,They have come so far!,"Being a Matchbox Twenty fan hasn't been easy with the Mad Season album playing singles that don't really represent their best work. However, this album captures the pure maturity of their sound and work as a band. My favorite song, ""downfall"" is the best song MB20 has ever recorded. They mix it up with gospel and the results are amazing. If you have never experienced MB20 give Yourself or Someone Like You a try. You won't be disapointed."
3,I expected more...,"Matchbox 20 is one of my favorite groups, but this CD could have been SO much better. The only good songs are Disease and Unwell. And the last song, The Difference, is 8 minutes long! That's WAY too long. Unless you're the biggest Matchbox 20 fan, then I wouldn't suggest buying this."
5,More Than You Think It Is,"This album proves, once again, that this band is something special. This album is a continuation of the great Mad Season. It is just one great song after another great song. This album is brilliant and it shows how the band continues to grow, as well as Rob's voice. This band is definitely one of the best ones today."
3,Mad Season's better,"I was really excited to hear that matchbox twenty had a new album coming out. My high expectations for this album were met when I heard the first few tracks of it. However, after listening to Mad Season again, I have to say that More than You Think You Are doesn't match the level of Mad Season. I think the songs on Mad Season are more emotional and ""deeper"" than those on More than You Think You Are. I'm a little disappointed; I was definitely expecting more after matchbox twenty's phenomenal second album."
2,I can't believe I am doing this.....,"I can't believe I am actually giving a 2 star review to anything associated with Rob Thomas. I am pretty disapointed with this CD overall. I like the first single ""Disease"" and there are a couple of others that aren't too bad like ""Unwell"". Overall it seems like Rob isn't in control of the writing like he usually is. I think he is trying to not stand out so much as the focal point of the group on this CD. There is a noticable difference in their sound to the point where some of the songs don't even sound like them at all... I am for evolution within a band but this is a bit too different too soon. ""Mad Season"" was in my opinion the best of the three so far. However, much of that opinion is due to the overplay of the first CD. I only hope that this is not the beginning of the end for them as there isn't really any standout hits on this CD like the last one had... or the first one for that matter."
5,They just keep getting better and better!!,"As a big Matchbox Twenty fan, I am not disappointed at all. Just like with ""Mad Season"", I like every single song on this album. My favorites are ""Unwell"", ""Could I Be You"", and ""Hand Me Down"". I was literally surprised with the hidden track. I guess that's why they call it hidden. Rob Thomas can sing anything and make it sound good. There is nothing bad I can say about this.So, go and buy this album NOW!!"
5,A great CD definitly worth it !,I recommend this for everyone. It's the best Matchbox 20 CD yet.It's one of my all time favorites.
5,I felt this cd,"The lyrics are AWESOMEI love this CD!I'l be honest I bought it for Unwell and Disease, and only listened to those songs fr a week, but once the whole CD settled into me, I found myself with all 3 MB20 cds in my changer on random. and its been like that for quite some time now. keep in mind, that I'd swore off pop since michelle branch, but thank god MB20 is around, else i'd be listening to R&B all day for some soul."
5,Simply worth it!,"One of the best albums that I own, and I can say that MB20 is simply one of the best 'real' band out there (you know who I'm talking about). I really can't stand stuff they play on the radio these days, and this album is a treasure even though it was released long ago (first heard Unwell during high school).My favorites: Disease, Bright Lights, Unwell, Cold, Could I Be You, Feel, and Downfall (whoa almost all of them).And definitely check out their latest, Exile on Mainstream. Can't wait for the next one, releasing this year!!! Go MB20!"
2,The Rush To Record & Release Shows.....,"many people do not realize the 4-yr span between Matchbox Twenty's first two albums. All I can is they should have taken another 4 years.This albums sounds rushed & over-produced. Every song leaves you saying ""Who does that sound like"" and it's because the album simply has no consistency, no flow, no 'theme'. It simply sounds like a collection of songs that have the writer as their only common bond. There are only one or two songs that 'sound like' Matchbox Twenty. While some may say that is good and that they are developing, the simply fact is that their original sounds was obviously fine as-is. This album comes across as a ""well, we're big enough now we can do whatever we want"" project.I am deeply disappointed."
5,absoutely astounding!!!,"Definitely an excelent follow up to Mad Season, not as depressing as it, but neither mellow or cheesy MB20 strikes again with More Than You Think You Are (MTYTYA). worth the money (hey! it's not CHEAP!!!) and very very worth listening."
1,Going down fast,There are 12 songs on this CD. 11 of which aren't worth air play. CD's like this are the reason I burn most of my music off the internet.
1,"Another bland, heartless, boring band for the masses","I ask you one question: Why bother?More questons: Why does this music exist? So conservative middle Americans can a have a bland, risk free group to go see once a year at the local arena when wrestling or tractor pulls aren't in town?? I mean WHY!!?? What is appealing about this half baked, uninspired, low brow poorly written tripe? Why would anyone be interested in a band of Southern frat boys? Does the Hootie and the Blowfish crowd need a new band to follow? Lord help us."
5,unbelievable!!,"This new release was worth the wait! The diversity of the songs is great, it truly showcases the amazing songwriting talents of Rob Thomas, he is in a class by himself! It also shows that the other members of the band Paul and Kyle are creative song writers. The emotion that comes out of each song as you listens reminds me why I love this band so much. They have grown as artists and people, and it is apparent here. The lyrics to the songs strike a chord of understanding with all people. Don't wait, you need this cd today! ENJOY!! Wish I could rate it 10 Stars."
4,A Colombus-Type Discovery,"I feel like Christopher Colombus, having discovered a fantastic new world that had been there for eons, unnoticed, right in front of me.I bought this album some time ago, and for some reason it lay in the pile, played once and forgotten, soon consumed by the jungle of cd's around it.As fate would have it, I recently heard ""Smooth"" playing on the radio, and remembered that Rob Thomas and the rest of Matchbox Twenty were sitting there at home, just waiting to be re-discovered.To cut the story short, there is no way that this cd is going back to the jungle. ""Disease"" and ""Unwell"" of course make the cd worth buying in the first place, but the other songs are also treasures, except ""Feel"", which I didn't really like much.""Bright Lights"", ""Cold"" and ""All I Need"" are my picks after the top two, the album being more than worth the price."
3,somewhat disappointed,I've been an avid matchbox twenty fan since they first came out. Obviously I went out and purchased more than you think you are right away. I wish I didn't. There was this great anticipation to get the new album especially since I basically wore out my mad season cd if it's possible. Except for a few songs on the album I was very disapointed. Most of the songs seemed to not have the same flavor and edge that matchbox twenty is known for. From time to time the cd comes out and I play it...but if I was someone who didn't really listened to matchbox twenty and wanted to start I would definately choose another CD. This one was very disappointing to me as a whole
5,Finally got my fix,"Finally, a new album! I have been waiting for a new one since my others are worn to the bone. I think they have done it again. I heard Disease and loved it. I can't wait to hear the rest of the songs become hits one by one like the last 2 albums.They always throw in a few really great ballads, too! Unwell, Soul and Hand me down are my favorites. Could I be you is another great one. By it now and listen and enjoy! It's like a good book you can't get enough of."
5,More Than You Think You Are is inspirational,"The new album More Than You Think You Are from the spectacularly talented band Matchbox Twenty is to say the least inspirational. It's a new and refreshing sound from the band and promises to be as amazing, if not more incredible than their previous albums. There is one song in particular that seems to get into your soul. Unwell is the fourth track on the album and is by far my favorite. Pick up more than you think you are and if you aren't a fan of matchbox twenty by now you will be. Rob, Kyle, Adam, Paul and Brian amazing me with each new album and they will amaze you too!"
3,Good listen start to finish,"My review is actually for 3 1/2 stars. Many critics have called Matchbox 20's 3rd release boring or to normal. So whats wrong with normal I ask? In todays music world of over the top teeny bopper junk and I dont even call this hip hop stuff music, this music is just what we need. Its good lyrics, good sound, and overall the band is as tight as they have ever been on this album. I think its better than mad season easily. Everyone keeps comparing to the first album ""Yourself or someone like you"" but you cant do that. That is one of the best albums released in recent years so just accept this new one for what it is, good music thats enjoyable to listen to."
5,More than you think it is,"Matchbox Twenty got their third album out, and I am impressed. Mixing the more upbeat flavor of Yourself or Someone Like You with the calmness of Mad Season formulated a superb album. Having all three, I'd say that Disease is one of the best songs they have made. Also, listen for the bonus track after The Difference. At about 4:15 into the track, a second bonus song with no name plays. That song it very upbeat, and is worth listening to. Buy this album and enjoy some of Matchbox Twenty's finest music."
2,Maybe it's just me...,"Who knows, maybe it IS just me, but this one doesn't come close to Yourself Or Someone Like You, an album which still can be heard throughout my home/car quite frequently. The only song I can really get into is ""All I Need,"" but it sounds so much like something from The Traveling Wilburys' library that I feel guilty playing it. Whether or not it will grow on me remains to be seen. Mad Season never did. I just can't ""feel"" it. I recommend the little known album ""Breathe The Daylight"" by Sonichrome for those who yearn for the old Matchbox."
3,"3-1/2 stars -- Not their best, but still worth the purchase","Matchbox Twenty's third album is by no means bad, but it's not their best work either. There really aren't any standouts to the likes of ""Bent"" or anything from their first album. But there are some good songs like ""Bright Lights"", ""Disease"" and a few others. If you're a big Matchbox Twenty fan, add this to your collection. For everyone else, the choice is up to you."
3,"I like it, it's good, but not great","Matchbox Twenty had another hit with ""Unwell."" Most of the other tracks did not get a lot of radio play, although ""Disease"" got a nod. Overall, it is a decent pop rock album, but there is not a lot of diversity of sound here. While I like Matchbox Twenty, they could have spent a little more time refining another couple of songs, particularly with a little less vocal strain to the lead singer, to create a better album with more radio play songs."
3,Not as good as the other two,"I was a little disappointed with MB20's latest CD. The previous albums had only a small number of soft rock tracks, which were actually quite good (like Rest Stop on Mad Season). On this album, the soft rock has taken front stage. There really isn't one song that has the screaming guitars of, say, Angry, Crutch or Stop. Most songs on ""More Than You Think You Are"" are well crafted, but just a little too sweet and slick.If you like the somewhat rougher sound of Matchbox 20, this is not your CD (try Hoobastank instead). If you love their soft rock side, this is just your CD."
5,The best is yet to come,"Somehow each mb20 CD gets better and better. I love this CD, the soulful lyrics of Rob as well as a a few of the other bandmates are amazing and Rob's voice never fails to captivate me. There are a few good hard rockers as well as the usual haunting ballads that everyone can relate to. WONDERFUL CD, can't wait to see what they do next!"
4,Some pretty good songs but...,"it truly is not filled with as much catchy or quality music that matchbox 20 has put out there with its first two releases. It has those nice, uplifting choruses for a few, but some of the other songs just drag you down a little more than past albums."
5,More Than You Think It Was Going to Be,"Rob Thomas prooves that he and his band is here to stay with this grammy nominated album and Matchbox Twenty's third record. This is by far their best album, and I can say that truthfully for I'm a huge fan of their break through debut album as well. The guitar parts and background vocalists are awesome and have made a huge fan of the band. Tracks 1-7, Downfall, and The Difference are what make the album the best by the band and wil make it a classic."
3,Not their strongest but still good,"""More Than You Think You Are"" is a pretty good album, but my least favorite by Matchbox Twenty. Some people found ""Mad Season"" to be pretentious while I just plain found it to be beautiful and well-done. ""More"" has some strong tunes but it doesn't hold together as an album. I've always thought Rob Thomas was a great writer (especially on Mad Season) but this album has some great writing, good writing, and some weak writing. I hope Rob can kick it up a notch for the next album."
5,WOW,"This is one amazing CD! It's rare that every single song on a CD can be worth listening to, but here they've done it! And the lyrics are so intelligent too, really, go buy it!"
5,More Than They Think They Are,"The wait is over. Matchbox Twenty has once again proven that they are a force to be reckoned with and silenced the critics. With lyrical contributions from Paul Doucette and Kyle Cook, More Than You Think You Are is brilliant!!! The range of emotions captured by this album, with songs like Disease, Hand Me down and the bonus track So Sad So Lonely guarantees something for everyone. More Than You Think You Are is must have for anyone looking for good meaningful music."
3,Stands above the rest!!,"I'm glad MB-20 is back to save rock and roll - God knows it needed saving!! MB-20 writes some of the most melodically driven fun rock seen in decades, plus they're always looking for new ways to diversify their sound, something many other bands never attempt.In short, if you like solid rock and roll, you can't go wrong with MB-20. IT'S FUN, JUST LIKE SANTANA'S CD!HOPE THIS HELPS!"
5,Outstanding!,"Couldn't wait for this third CD from Matchbox Twenty, and I was not disappointed at all. Terrific mix of sounds, fantastic lyrics and vocals, from a band that just keeps getting better with time! Stand out songs include the beautiful and driving sound of Bright Lights; Unwell; All I Need (has the feel of the 60's to it); Downfall; The Difference, and last but certainly not least, So Sad So Lonely. This is the unlisted bonus song that comes at the end of track 12. I'm at a loss for words to describe it except to say that it is fantastic! When you hear it you'll know what I mean. This CD is awesome!"
5,'More Than You Think You Are' is a hit!,"I was absolutely stunned when I listened to this album. I'm a huge Matchbox fan, and so when I heard 'Disease' I was excited, but I was hoping the band would have stuck with more of the 'Mad Season' stuff. Although MTYTYA is a far cry from MS, it isn't like Yourself or Someone Like You, either. It's an eclectic mix that at times reminds me of the Beatles, and at other times reminds me of Mick Jagger, but all the time screams Matchbox brilliance. The lyrics are great, and the songs rock--hard! There is a song for every mood on this album, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,They just get better with every CD...,"I absolutely love this CD. There are very few CD's I can listen to beginning to end, but this one I could play all the time. Honestly, 'Disease' never grew on me, but that's my only disappointment on their latest. Of course, 'Unwell' (even though it's worn out now) became my anthem. The words, music, and singing in 'Bright Lights' and 'Hand Me Down' is beautiful, as is 'The Difference'. Love the song at the end. It's not listed on the album - it seems like a last minute throw-in kind of thing, complete with Rob saying, ""No way, that's lame, man!"" if you listen hard enough at the end. Nothing but good things to say about my guys - they just get better with every CD! Saw this one in concert, they were absolutely incredible! Drove from Florida to Memphis for this concert - worth every minute!"
4,"Falls short, but a great album nonetheless","I bought this album in a hurry with very high expectations after listening to Mad Season, one of my favorite CDs. As much as I love Matchbox 20, I have to say, I was a little disappointed with More Than You Think You Are. While some songs are certainly great, too many of them sound similar to each other and that repetition just gets old after a while. Standout tracks include Downfall and The Difference, two very great, very distinct songs. So a nice attempt, but I really think they can do better."
4,"It took a couple of listens, but...",I find I'm seriously enjoying this more and more with each listen. Great CD!
1,Longing for the early years...,"After Matcbox Twenty hit sophomore slump status with ""Mad Season"", I still had hope for the band's third release. And I'm listening...and listening...and listening...nope! Still can't find much worth hearing again other than ""Disease"" and ""Unwell"", which you can hear by buying or downloading the singles. Or just listen to the radio! You'll hear them more than you ever want to! There's a reason these guys are hiding their faces on the cover of this album!! Because they've sold out! All the songs pretty much have the same lifeless sound. Definitely doesn't hold a candle to their debut, ""Yourself or Someone Like You""! Buy the debut instead...and embrace it, because it's Matchbox Twenty's only good album!!"
2,2 generous stars,"The reason why I got the album, was because of 'Unwell' and 'Unwell' only.Alas, this catchy tune along with the previously released 'Disease' were basically the only songs truly worth listening to.I suggest you get MB20's 'Unwell' single.That song will always rule."
2,paba for the masses,"Sorry, by reading the reviews, I am going to assume that I am the only one who did not like this album. I loved the first two they put out ""Mad Season"" being my favorite, but just cannot get into this latest album. to me every song sounds the same, and none of them grabbed me, I personally would not recomend it, and in fact will be selling my copy."
5,Awesome!!!,"omg this album is awesome, i didn't know if i would like it but when i heard their new single disease i was like omg i gotta buy this CD, and i was surprised to find that all the songs are awesome. i love this CD, it's one of my favorites. definatly go out and buy this CD if you are a MatchBoxTwenty fan."
2,Big disappointment,"Yourself or Someone Like You is one of my favorite CDs, and Mad Season eventually grew on me... maybe that's what it will be like for this CD, but after listening to it once, I'm disappointed. The majority of the album seems so bland. The only songs that stood out were ""Disease"", ""Unwell"", and ""You're So Real"", and ""The Difference"". If you're new to Matchbox 20, I'd suggest you get Yourself or Someone Like You instead of this album."
4,Great Tribute to King,"The cut ""King"" is a wonderful tribute to Martin Luther King. The song is a musical journey into the life of this great leader. This song is an excellent way for many to remember this fallen leader.I also thoroughly enjoyed the cut ""From a distance"". While I am very fond of Bette Midler's original rendition, I liked the soulful touches that Goodin brings to this beautiful and moving song."
1,"Bad Sonics, Bad Interpretation -- judging just by Egmont Overture on this Recording; WARNING: Don't get your ears pierced!",I promptly got rid of this CD. The sonics are atrocious. Thin and overly contrasty with pierce-your-ears treble on louder portions. The Egmont is poorly done too. No meaning. Grind-thru and then pierce-your-ears on the loud parts. What a dissapointment. This NY Philharmonic was nothing like the PBS live TV broadcast of the NY Philharmonic in mid 2006 doing the Egmont. The other reviewer (to date) also hated this CD. Don't buy it!
2,very cheap,this was a terrible item to gift...i was very unimpressed by it...and my son had no intrest in this toy.
4,Great for younger children,"My 2 year old grandson loves Buzz Lightyear. The hard plastic one is too bulky for him, so this soft plush version is perfect right now and a great size."
5,PSSSSSST! PSSSSSST!,"Does your PC's sound suck? Do you have a stereo, compact or component, sitting idly nearby?Think no more about forking out money for computer speakers or sound cards! For just $4 you can buy this marvelous little wire and hook your PC's sound output into your stereo, or even into a boombox if it has audio aux inputs. That way you can upgrade your stereo speakers if you want to and enjoy them for both PC and music/home-theatre usage.This is the best-kept little secret that Best Buy, Circuit City, etc. DON'T want you to find out about! Radioshack also carries the same adapter. Sure the signal suffers a little and there can be some hum in the background at really high volumes (you'll need a $30 Ground Loop Isolator, from Xitel.com to get rid of that if you really mind) but if you just want decent-not-spectacular sound from your PC, why spend over $100 bucks on a soundcard and good computer speakers when this lovely $4 device will do the trick?"
4,Very Powerful Voice,"I think this CD gets lost in the hodgepodge of female singers (Christina, Britney, Vanessa, etc) and that is ashame. The songs are much better than on any of those other female singer and she can do nothing but get stronger. The music is well crafty, but that voice comes powerfully out of your speakers. This is a good CD for people of all ages. I see great things for her."
5,I love this CD!!,"This cd is the best. For those of you who are thinking about getting it,but are not to sure. Let me assure you there is nothing to hesitate about!! You need to get it. It really is a CD that makes you think,and uplifts your spirits. Stacie Orrico really put thought into this CD,and all the songs are not about just boys. Its about all life issues. Which is great And it should help anyone through life. :) So, what are you waitng for?get this CD!"
5,GREAT GREAT,"I Love this CD. I would say it is my favorite of the 3 she has made, but the other 2 are GREAT too.Stuck(10/10)a really great song(Theres gotta be) More to Life(15/10)my favorite reeeeeelllly goodBounce Back(6/10) one of my least favritesI Promise(8/10)a good songSecurity(9/10) a very up-beat song with a good messageInstead(10/10) such a good tune and a good messageHesitation(10/10)a very good song.

5,Love this CD!!,"Im so in love with this cd,an its always on heavy rotation.But I think Stacie did a damn good job with this album.She really mature vocally on this album,I think this is her best album,cant wait till she comes out with another one.1.Stuck- Love this song,Always ""Stuck"" in my head. 5/52.More To Life- Wasnt a favorite of mines,but the more I listen to it on the radio an such,the more I like it. 5/53.Bounce Back- I love to ""Bounce"" to this song. 5/54.I Promise- Another standout song. 4/55.Security- Love this song. 5/56.Instead- An alright song. 4/57.Hesitation- Least favorite on the album. 3/58.Strong Enough- Beautiful song on the album.My favorite. 6/59.I Could Be The One- Another favorite of mines. 5/510.Maybe I wont look back- Nice song. 4/511.Tight- Another nice upbeat song. 4/512.Thats Whats Loves About- Nice song but isnt my fav. 4/5Overall this is a good album. Go out an buy!!!Now!!"
2,come on,"Well, stacie orrico is not genuine anymore. She's just another pop singer who really just wants to be another brittney spears, but will never admit it. Wasn't she christian? I guess not anymore. It's a shame that she was a christian artist only until she got high enough on the popularity chart where she could cross over and people would still listen. Her 2 hit songs were pretty big and i think i even sung along with them before(which scared me). that's why she gets two stars."
2,Hmmm.....puzzled,"Hmm....I honesly really do not know what to say...after buying her CD,except for the first week I really do not listen to it. For me, usually I like a song based on the how it sounds, but if it has no substance in it then after that week it's boring. Like the first week was good and I liked Stacie, but now her songs are annoying after a couple listens. ""Strong Enough"", ""Stuck"", and ""More To Life"" are the best tracts. Her lyrics are mosttly pretty superficial and shallow. If you like to think about what you're listening to then don't get this. Also, it's pretty annoying after a couple listens and most of the songs sound the same! So be warned!!"
2,Disappointing for Christian fans...,"I bought her first album a few years ago and liked it mainly for its strong Christian aspects. Now, she admittedly sounds better, but the tone is your basic Britney (or any other belly-button girl), teeny bopper style. I hope her next album has more Christian Contemporary rather than secular pop. Otherwise she'll just become another MTV icon, not Dove awards candidate."
2,Needs more time to mature,This is exploitation of teenagers to make a quick buck for the managers/producers. Full stop.She needs to take a few years off and tour around the local scene just doing local gigs to gain more experience and to fully develop herself and perhaps learn to write better songs.Then I think she'll do much better.
3,Stuck,"I've had this album for ages, ever since I started listening to the radio. I've never heard of Stacie Orrico before this album, but she's made it a hit, there are a lot of people who knows it. ""Stuck"" is one of the catchiest songs ever made, many fell in love with it the first time they've heard it. ""More to Life"" is also incredible, I am astonished at how many times I can listen to it before I get tired of it.Despite the fact that the first two songs are a miracle, the other songs are ALL about religion, which made me realize that it was Christian music. I don't really mind that, but those songs got pretty boring and similar in the end, only there is another song called ""Instead"", the sixth track, with both good lyrics and a strong beat. I like this album, and I think it is worth my money, but listen to the samples before you buy the album, seriously!"
3,Unbalanced,"I kind of accidently got this CD from someone who didn't love it.Stuck is a great song and it definitly got her out there. The video was a little weird; could have been more grown up. My absolute favorite song is ""More To Life"". Great single, if only the rest of the album was like it she's be on her way. I also like the third song; it's catchy and the ballad is great. Then I simply go back to the beginning.As for the creepy people who go all crazy-religious? Damn, let the girl have some success! She's got talent why waste it? Jessica Simpson stayed religious, she even held back some!I'd definitly put ""more to life"" on a compilation CD with a few Jessica Simpson songs, Mandy Moore's ""Top of the World"", Christina's ""fighter"", ""can't hold us down"", and the beautiful heart-breaking ballad (#18 on Stripped), Willa Ford's ""someone take the pain away"".Stacie's also pretty and that will help her go farther. I wish her good luck and hope for something a little more mainstream all-around next time."
1,"sickly voice - only good songs ""There's Gotta Be...""&""stuck""","no, no, no! I bought this album after hearing her good first two singles, and then was dissapointed! The worst songs are ""I Promise"" and ""I Could Be The One"" - both forthcoming singles."
4,Go Stacie!,Wow i just have to say this is a great CD my friend has it and loves to listen to it so when i hear it it's just great dancing music!It makes you feel great about yourself after a hard day because she is so clean cut and a great role model!The only drawback is her voice really isn't that original but it grows on you so i really think you should buy it anyway.GO STACIE!
5,Good CD,I really liked this album a lot. I think she has a good voice and the songs are all very upbeat and positive. They are also catchy and make you want to sing along and dance.
5,I love it!!,"I love this CD. Stacie is great,representing Seattle. My favorite song from this CD is ""I Promise."" It is great and has a great beat and lyrics!!"
3,"ok, few songs i didnt like.",Her album is pretty cool but i really didnt like some of the 'slow' songs. More to life & Stuck are excellent though.
5,Very Fresh Sound for Faith-based music,I'm so excited that Stacie is out in the public eye and then to hear such wonderful music for a wide range of audiences. I think this album has a variety of sounds & yet every song has a great message and speaks to hearts of young (not so young) women.There is everything from ballads to dance tunes to just singing in the car lyrics. Definately worth the money.
5,A Must Have,"This CD is a must have. The tracks don't all sound the same, but still retain an overall style that is distinctive and captivating. Her voice is amazing and is truly defined. You will listen to this CD all the way through without skipping a track."
5,Stuck is da best song eva,I think that STUCK is just the best song eva. I even think that is better then sum of Christinas songs and i am a big fan of her!!!
5,Furthering the ministry,"Stacie Orrico's blend of music is very refreshing and interesting. She uses elements of r&b and mainstream pop, to further the ministry, salvation and hope through Jesus Christian. This album appealed to me very much because she has a very soulful voice. The album does not offer anything offensive, instead it brings us to a place of warmth and hope that no despair can chill. The songs are sugar coated, but the topics that they tackle are very spiritually deep and uplifting. The album is a breath of fresh air from all the music that's coming out today. Tracks like More To Life, Strong Enough and I Could Be The One are the best in this album. A must have for gospel and pop fans."
3,she sucks,she only has up to 4 good song on this cd she wont make it good i mean i loved the cd all 12 tracks were good but still to much of singing about god come on stacie sing about teenage stuff but hey if u want go buy it who am i to stop u
1,What Happened,"I am a christen girl who really used to like Stacie Orrico.Then she started making songs that were talking about boys not God. Now I could have lied to my parents and said yes these are good christen songs. But I knew in mt heart they werent. Now all I have to say is that it is wrong.Its not just Stacie Orrico. But to all whom do it, I believe God looks down on you. How could you . I personally will never buy a Stacie Orrico CD again."
4,Great CD for any teen,This CD would have to be one of the most popular CD's of 2003. Features the songs 'Stuck' and '(theres gotta be) More To Life' and the upcoming singles 'I Promise' and 'I Could Be the One.' A truely inspirational album.
4,Gorgeous!,"Hey everyone!!! I find this cd a great mix of r&b and pop. I am a fellow christian to stacie and I love her gorgeous voice. I can't believe she's only 16!! I received this cd as a gift when I learned to play 'stuck' on the guitar. It's a wonderful cd with feeling, strong harmonies, beautiful melody and catchy music. I look forward to buying stacie's previous album now."
5,Excellent but ...,"I enjoy her music very well but in this cd, I noticed the songs are less Godly and bit more contempory. The is not like B. Spears but really isn't totally Godly music. Nevertheless, good music and worth buying"
4,Stacie- all the way,"This album is truly the best. Stacie's song'Stuck' reminds me about a boy, who liked me but then lied and said he like someone else. I truly hate him but i still love him and i can't stop thinking about him. Another favorite song i like is 'Strong Enough' that song to me expresses the way she feels about God. I think Stacie should stick to writing her own songs. All the one's she writes are the most beautiful. Keeping working hard Stacie, i'm sure each new album will be better and better.-Peace out, Love!!!!"
4,Bought it for My Wife,"I got this CD for my wife, and she listens to it all the time. She really likes it, I would have given it a 5 star due to the fact, but I have to listen to it when she has it on and frankly its not my type of music, so they loose a star...Sorry Stacie Orrico"
4,It's 4.5 stars not 4.,"I love this cd,the only problem is I don't reallylike ""hesitation"" and ""tight"".My favorites on this cd are:1.Stuck.2.More to life.3.Instead.4.Stronger(It's a great ballad).5.I could be the one.Buy this cd you won't be dissapointed,because ithas all the music styles on it(pop,rock,rnb)."
2,Stacie Orrico CD,"I bought this CD because I loved Stacie Orrico's More to Life and also enjoyed Stuck. I was expecting the other songs to be similar to More to Life and Stuck, but they were very different, and not much to my taste."
5,Required Reading for all India Trekers...,"In this book the author goes across Southern India with her five year old daughter...more or less as a ""backpacker"" would today. This book should be requried reading for anyone planning a similar trip... It is not dated...even though it precedes the Lonely Planet Backbackers by a couple of decades... I learned something about India on every page...and particularly about the Deccan and how it relates to the North of India... Truly a page turner...hard to put down..."
1,terrible singer/great guitarist,I found Danny to be a great guitar player but the singer on the ablum was annoying. I really think I am being nice in saying this. He is very distracting and makes me feel like I am now stuck with a CD I won't be listening to because of the vocals.
4,Out in Africa,"I'm intrigued by the strange point of view of the egotistical, quirky protagonist, in her search of love (or at least sex) and fulfilment in Boer Botswana. I find this book humorous,rich in interesting notations on the human quirks, and the style reminds me of Nabokov's Lolita, Thank God without humbert humbert."
5,An intellectual joy ride; enthralling from beginning to end.,"Rush has created an extraordinary female voice - she is intellectually vibrant, sexually present, emotionally complicated and always engaging. I can only compare his writing to Austen's. For those who find it boring, I can only respond that perhaps they should stick to ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""The Love Letter""!!!"
2,Huh?,"Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations. A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten. Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's expansive vocabulary is more tortured than inspiring. (Or, as Mark Twain put it, ""it grates on the fastidious ear."") A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution. The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy."
1,A couple of academic bags of hot air,"Go to Africa and pontificate. I don't know why this book got the great reviews it did. I found it almost embarrassing to be stuck in the heads of characters with such inflated self-images. Seeing the world through their eyes was like being stuck on a long car drive with your spouse's uncle, who thinks he knows everything and never shuts up. Some people may have liked the ""famous social scientist"" who is just a self-satisfied man, pleased to think he is king of his small kingdom. I found it utterly boring. Occasional attempts at wit or insight didn't redeem this book for me. I'd say avoid it diligently."
2,Who talks like this?,"This book was WAY too much work given the payoff. Sentences meander endlessly and are strewn with 25 cent words--and those 25cent words don't help establish the character, but just seem to be an opportunity for the author to throw them around. I don't mind getting an education but the incessant use of ""big"" words diminished the credibility of the main character. Who really uses this kind of vocabulary so frequently either in thought or in speaking? Instead of visualizing a character all I could see was an author with a thesauraus by his side looking for opportunities to flaunt his penchant for polysyllabic and obscure words. And following the sentences/character's line of thought is a constant chore. The main character is smug and seems to feel she's funnier (especially with her wordplay) than she actually is. This book just made me feel dumb...like I'm not smart enough to ""get it"". Overall a pretentious, elitist book that makes James Joyce's stuff seem light and breezy."
1,dont waste your time,"I really did not like this book, it is so full of cliche intellectual discussion of all issues it is so desperately trying to address, feminism, development and socialism.There are so many words in the book that are not known to the average reader(myself and i saw in the reviews that someone else made the same comment, so I dont feel as bad). The fact is the use of these words does not make the prose any better, merely harder to read. It is almost as if it was written with the help of a thesaraus (and dictionaries from other languages).I do not think this is a genuine portrayal of a relationship either, I mean, does anyone think that the dialogue between the lovers can be for real? That is what is wrong with this book in general. It is not genuine and way too pretentious."
1,Gave me a headache,"I love books, and I love to read, but this book was a waste of both my time and money. I needed a thesaurus, a dictionary, and a bottle of aspirin to complete this book (which I did.)I was highly disappointed."
3,Misses the mark,"I found myself incredibly frustrated with the novel's protagonist, an intelligent and resourceful woman in the last years of a PhD program. She spent so much energy--both physical and emotional--chasing after the ""man of her dreams"". Once she snagged him, she then dedicated countless hours analyzing each facet of his existence. Her character seemed to be nothing more than a high-brow Ally McBeal. I'd rather read a novel about an equally sharp woman applying her talents to an interesting problem."
3,A compulsive talker writes and writes,"Original, insufferable, grandstanding, unbearable, relentless, and (in its evocations of Africa) often stunning and memorable. I so much prefer Norman Rush's astounding short stories in WHITES. In a more disciplined form he is able to contain his stories and contain himself, but the liberating spaciousness of the novel, in throwing open the verbal floodgates, has been fatal to the otherworldly world he wants to make real."
4,"Not for all tastes, but you just might be delighted.","Less entrancing on second reading (my first was back in 1991), but still a tour-de-force. What then seemed refreshing and impressive in the narrator now sometimes borders on the insufferable -- I could do without ever seeing the word 'overdetermined' again -- but in her defense she *does* warn the reader that she loves to talk. And does she ever! Rush lays out a feast of wordplay between two hyperverbal lovers, garnishing it with a story about the meeting of high-minded Western ideals and the age-old social dynamic of the village. While some here have criticised the book as lacking dramatic tension, I was entirely in the grip of such scenes as the very public showdown between Denoon, the guru-like architect of a women's utopia, and the disgruntled 'snakes in Eden' working to sow dissent. And I'd love to know what happens to the narrator after the book's end."
2,"look behind the ""Five star"" reviews","Of the 35 readers who gave this book a five star review, 18 have never reviewed any other book; 5 have reviewed only one other book; two have reviewed only two other books (and in both those cases one of the other books was by an author who was one of the blurb-writers for ""Mating""). What does, or should, this tell you? We all know, or should know, that Amazon's reader reviews are highly subject to manipulation, including ""manufactured"" reviews."
1,a real yap-fest,"A wide-ranging, cultivated mind is on display in these pages, but the operative phrase is 'on display.' The book reads like a series of intellectual vignettes-- from the authorship of Shakespeare's plays to the politics of the ANC-- all strung on a thin, frayed thread of story. Every time Rush wanders-- unwittingly-- within hailing distance of a dramatic moment, he unfailingly blows it by larding on more gab. The comparison to Jane Austen could not be more inappropriate-- she always philosophizes in the service of her story; for Rush, the story is a pretext for trotting out another interesting, marginally relevant tidbit from his apparently vast card file of 3X5s. That the powers that be at amazon.com consider this one of the best novels of the 90s does not bode well for the rest of their list"
1,literary masturbation,"I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather.I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate.Dumpster fodder."
1,How & why did this win the National Book Award,It got so boring by the second half of the book that I had to skim the first line of each paragraph to get through it.
1,A Painful Read,"After a disappointing experience with ""Hunted,"" I decided to give Mr. Johnstone a second try with ""Breakdown."" If possible, ""Breakdown"" is worse. The characters are poorly drawn, stereotypical and completely one-dimensional. As with Mr. Johnstone's other work, the plot is utterly predictable. A particularly annoying habit is Mr. Johnstone's interjection of himself into the story (a la Hitchcock) as a right-thinking, long-suffering writer. I cannot imagine the government having much interest in Mr. Johnstone or his body of work. If you long for conservative rhetoric, read William F. Buckley. If you want great adventure, try Jack London. Mr. Johnstone's work gives pulp fiction (and conservative views) a bad name."
5,BREAKDOWN,"I must agree with Brian's review on this one as being one of Johnstones best. The read is very entertaining, if that's what you read for and not dissection. If you let your imagination go with this book you'll find yourself walking right along with them!"
4,So bad that it is good!,"This book is absolutely hilarious. Don't let the ultra-conservative ravings get you down. Everything in this book is either so bad, so fake, or so blown out of proportion, that it is just absolutely hilarious. I can understand and identify with some (few?) of the ravings of the conservative lunatics in this book, but otherwise, I just look at it as raving propaganda. I just happen to really like stories where society breaks down, and as a result this book entertains me. I pretty much found myself laughing all the way through the stereotypical madness that is presented in this book. All I can say is this book is just pure stupid entertainment, and its still better than TV"
1,Another Marz Hack Job,"If you are a fan of Green Lantern comics at all, don't waste your time with this trash. Trade paperbacks with original material should represent a milestone in the characters life but Marz manages to maintain the ho hum status quo that he had established in the abysmal Emerald Twilight story arc. The art is okay...I guess. My only real complaint with it is that the artist made Carol Ferris look about as appealing as the Elephant Man. In my opinion, save up a little extra money and get the Green Lantern Archives v. 1 or 2, the golden age GL archives, or the Green Lantern/Green Arrow Hardcover. They are all quality reads and definitely worthy additions to the library of any GL fan...unlike Fear Itself."
4,Visually stunning,"This book is worth the price alone for Brad Parker's stunning paintwork. You'd be hard pressed to find a better illustrated graphic novel out there and the visual impact alone is sure to satisfy long-time fans of the GL as well as draw in new readers. The writing does not quite live up to the high standard of the artwork but is still perfectly serviceable and offers a very cohesive, easy-to-digest storyline spanning 3 generations of the GL. Well worth your time."
1,Waste of money!,"Wow! This book is bad! I bought it because I'm a huge Hal Jordan/Green Lantern fan and I keep an open mind for all interpretations of his story. Unfortunately, the artwork on this project is so muddy and dark that it's nearly incomprehensible. Had I not seen this type of ""let's be artsy"" approach before, I would have assumed my copy was messed up by the printer and asked for a new copy.If (like me) you think Hal Jordan's best work resulted from the Denny O'Neil/Neal Adams pairing in 1970-'71, be aware that ""Fear Itself"" is 180 degrees different in every way."
1,Total waste of time,"The art almost looks like computer generated that is painted over, it has an amazing level of detail, but then it is kind of ""smudged"" or something. The storey is AWFUL. It is boring, the resolution is lame, the characters are thin, and the book is way to short. $20 is WAY to much to spend for this, I probalby wouldn't even spend $5 for it."
1,pink grapefruit sugar scrub,Product is really dry; it does not smell like grapefruit at all.I will not buy it again.
3,Acceptance,"Pilgrim's Inn reminds me of nothing as much as Alcott's Little Women. Part of a 3 title family saga, it tells of the efforts of 3 generations of Eliots to adjust to post WWII English life. The central theme is love and the virtues of giving of oneself. The story, which centers upon a move to a medieval building that was originally an inn for religious pilgrims, is frequently interrupted with little philosophical homilies applicable to the specific character in question. It's a pleasant read and a highly descriptive, interesting tale, but I found myself skimming the sermonettes with ever increasing rapidity."
1,Broken Buttons,I do not recommend this scale. The enter and memory buttons stuck and were inoperable. I wanted to update my memory settings yet couldn't. I only had the scale about 1 year. I just returned it to the manufacturer for a replacement. Wish me luck with Homedics 540 Health Scale.
5,Great Scale!,"I did my research and finally found this top-rated scale (rated #1 by Prevention Magazine). So far, no complaints, works as advertised, just read the directions. Delivered promptly and in great condition. Highly recommend it."
4,Decent Scale,"The scale seems to calculate everything as it should. I thought the body fat calcuation was incorrect, so I went and had it done on another machine with similar results. I, however, do not think the weight measurement is accurate. It seems to be a few pounds low and there is no way to reset or adjust an offset from the setting.If you want to feel skinner than you are, you cant go wrong."
4,Good overall value,"Similar to another review I read, I opened the box, installed the battery and got nothing but error messages (error1 to be exact). I tried reinstalling the battery and was getting quite frustrated when I noticed an extremely small swith on the back of the unit to move from metric to standard measurements. I moved it to metric and then back to standard and the scale started working. My guess is that it slid somewhere in between the two options during shipping. After the frustration passed, I found the scale quite easy to program and use. I don't like the fact that I need to have ""damp"" feet to gain an accurate measurement on anything other than weight, but I suppose the knowledge is worth the effort. This really is a very good scale and seems to cover a lot of worthwhile measurements with fairly decent accuracy. I would recommend it as a value buy."
5,Great Bathroom Scale!,"I found a review on this product in Prevention Magazine Online before making this purchase. This unit exceeds expectations. Accuracy is impressive for both weight and body fat percentage. The display is easily read, even for us senior citizens. It's sturdily built with a great warranty. This is a very effective tool for monitoring a diet and/or exercise program. We've only been using it for two months but we're very happy with our choice. A tip of the hat to Amazon.com for making such a quality product so affordable."
1,Waste of Money,"I fell for prevention magazine's glowing review of this scale too! This is a very expensive piece of trash. I have owned it for 1 1/2 years and it is never accurate, battery runs out quick, stores information and then ""looses"" it so you have to re-enter everything over again, so not worth the time or money. The worst part is when you weigh yourself and it weighs you 5 pounds lighter or heavier than it did yesterday, you never know your real weight! First I have to thank Homedics for making this junk and second I would like to thank Prevention magazine for the fake ""review"" of the scale, it was a paid advertisement by Homedics not a real consumer review, so that makes you losers too."
3,Great look and scale accuracy...Fat analyzer not so good,"The good:1) The weight is very accurate to the .2 of a pound.2) Clear and bright display3) Gives estimate of how many calories you to take to maintain weightBad:1) Worse of all the bad stuff...the fat analyzer is extremely inaccurate. I am 5'6"" with a healthy 157 lbs...but the scale had been saying that my body fat was 23%. After buying a handheld body fat analyzer I confirmed that my body fat was only 14% instead of 23%. The Body fat % can change dramatically (+/- 1%) depending on the time of the day you weight yourself.2) The estimate for healthy weight is not very consistent. Goes up and down by more than 5 pounds.In my opinion if you are going to by this scale be aware of these shortcomings. Hindsight 20/20, I would buy a regular digital scale for $30 or $40 and then buy the hand held body fat analyzer."
1,Do Not Buy Homemedics,"I bought a Homemedics scale about two months ago. The battery runs out about every two weeks. At $3.50 a pop, this scale has become very expensive fast. You call the 800 number and of course they expect a receipt and for me to ship it to them for replacement. Talk about lack of customer service! Terrible company - terrible scale!!!"
1,THIS IS THE WORST SCALE I HAVE EVER HAD,I researched very carefully and the Homedics SC-560 was recommended and I find it is 3 to 4 lbs off.
1,Totally unpredictable,"I got this for my daughter as a surprise, she was so excited UNTIL she actually used it. It showed her at one weight, she stepped off of it and back on, and it showed another weight. Better yet, she lives in the dorms and took it upstairs and weighed up there and it showed an even different weight! Good grief. It also showed her at an acceptable weight, next then underweight, then the next overweight. So, needless to say after others trying it and getting the same errors, I returned it for my money back. Boo, hiss...can I give it a zero?"
1,Very disappointed,"After I saw this scale advertised in Runner's World magazine, I set about finding one. I could not find it in the stores that the HoMedics website listed. Instead, I purchased it through Amazon. It arrived with the start button trapped in its slot and I was unable to even get it started. I was very disappointed with the marketing and the quality of this product. (Thanks to Amazon for letting me return it with a full refund and shipping costs.)"
5,Touching and sensitive,"A totally refreshing story brimming with warmth and and sensitivity and written beautifully. Thank you, Frank Messina."
2,"OOPS, Wrong Book!","Hey, I bought this book thinking it was by the real Frank Messina. LOL. What a sham! Warning. This book is not by the legendary spoken word artist Frank Messina, better check out frankmessina.com for the real one. But the author gets 2 stars just for having a cool name."
4,Ideal for beginners in Art of Theatre Makeup,"This books comes up with some ideal advice for students starting in this fascinating art. Some tips may have been superceeded with new products and methods but its always wise to have a few tips. The line drawings are clear but some people may prefer photographic demo. The writing is very clear, well thought out.Gives enthusiasm to learn more - grin.A good back up book if needed."
5,Terrific Biography,This is a terrific biography written with a great deal of historical sophistication.
3,Vinegar,"Not as vinegary as I expected it to be but if you are dieting I would strongly urge you to buy this product. It has a light, and airy taste. I was expecting a more strong, robust flavor."
2,What a disappointment!,"This book was on my WishList for over a year, and then it took 2 months to arrive after ordering it. What a disappointment after all that time!The book consists of a bunch of photos, some of which are pretty cool, but most of which are mediocre at best. There is no text, except for a one-page introduction, and another one-page tribute to George Freeth. Comments that accompany each photo are superficial, repetetive, and often just plain dorky. After 35 years of surfing California myself, and reading all the magazines, books, etc. over those years, this was a big letdown. I expected a lot more. ... the thing is way over-priced, unless you happen to big a big Doc Ball fan and/or are one of the old-timers in the photos. If not, save your dough."
1,James Feuling hates surfers,"Mr. Feuling was arrested for destruction of property, namely the windsheilds of cars in the parking lot at Rincon Point. I caught him breaking the windows of cars in 1989 at Rincon Point where he lived. He was arrested are charged with the crime, he plead no contest in court and paid restotution and damages. He also poisoned trees and animals (neighbors pets) in the Rincon Point private community. He is the author of this book and should be ashamed of what he did back then."
2,Poor quality item,"I purchased this for my 4 year old nephew's birthday. Imagine my embarrassment when the emu and the eco-guide would not stand up. Both were too top-heavy. Then, the eco-guide's leg fell off. Then his arm... and the crocodile's head. I purchased this item from a zoo gift shop based on the ""ages 3 and up"" print on the front, but we were left with many small pieces. Anything for kids 3-8 will be battered and abused and needs to be able to withstand a child playing with its moveable parts. Although my nephew still played with everything, the product is so cheaply made that I will not be buying him the dinosaur set that he begged me for. I would suggest to the company to either make the product more durable, or make each animal unmoveable (but standable!)."
1,Buyer's remorse...,"While the idea behind these products from Wild Republic is a good one, unfortunately the construction and quality are extremely poor. We'd had these items for less than a few hours before arms and limbs began breaking off. If you can find them, Animal Planet makes a series of similar playsets that are of much higher quality and that our son enjoys more. Otherwise, better to do without entirely than waste money on these cheap, flimsy toys."
1,don't buy this heater,i bought this heater about a month ago. i used it for my yoga class twice a week for an hour. it the blower quick working last week. what a waste of money. don't buy this heater.
1,Does not fit the 8610 Audiovox,"Don't believe the hype, this charger does not fit that phone. What a waste of time."
5,A beautiful accomplishment.,"Can you believe it, I found this CD in used records bin at a local record store for 4.99. It was in great shape. Lucky for me, this is great album. I guess the original purchaser was not a jazz fan fan. Carmen Lundy is great singer and also a wonderful songwriter. The album features some lush orchestral arrangements on such standards as 'Round Midnight, Spring Can Really Hang You Up, and My Favorite Things. Ms. Lundy does great on those. However, the finest moments of the album come on Carmen's own compositions. Firefly, Forgive Me and These Things You Are To Me are so deeply felt and emotional. They come from the inner most expressions of human feeling. They are beautiful and wonderfully performed. Overall a wonderful performance."
4,reinventing social work,"In an era of censure of social work, the profession diligently seeks to reinvent itself to better serve its constituency. Several models are available and are well presented in the volume. Though almost too much is attempted, particularly recommended are the articles in Part II. When combined with empowerment theory and the strengths-based approach to case management, Reinventing Human Services provides a perspective that holds real hope for change. The situation must improve--it can hardly get worse."
4,Twelve Lies,"Twelve Lies You Hear in Church uncovers faulty expectations about our faith and what God is doing in our lives. Tim Riter leads the reader into the dark forest of half-truths and reveals the twisted limbs of misleading teaching. As he guides us through the pitfalls and unseen traps of partial truths, you'll find yourself recognizing many dangers encountered in the Christian life. Tim reveals common fallacies we stumble over each day and provides Scriptural understanding to free us in our walk with God. This book is a must for every sincere Christian who desires a more meaningful relationship with God."
3,Voice is great and always masterful,"Howard Hewett is so talented, a great singer who crafts a story with his voice and passion...I like him much and this album is good reflection of him."
2,not please,I ordered (Its Time by Howard Hewett) the song (call his name) #13 will not play. I took it out of the box an discarded the invoice . returned home an spouse had put packing in trash.CD no good.I guess I am out of luck.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,THIS CD IS THE BOMB! THIS IS THE TYPE OF MUSIC WE NEED IN THE WORLD TODAY. THIS IS THE TYPE OF CD YOU SIT BACK ON A FRIDAY NIGHT WITH A GLASS OF WINE AND TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW AND JUST CHILL!!!
4,Return of the Black Mamba,"Do not get fooled by the horrenduos DVD cover art that has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has a black mamba and the cover shows a rattlesnake!! and it is horrible!!! But the movie is one hell of a ride! Late great actors Reed and Kinski bring some very cool and violent stuff to the screen. They kidnap a rich kid and everything goes ""Violently"" wrong, they get trapped in a house and ask for a ransom without knowing that a deadly black mamba is loose between their feet....that's when all hell breaks loose! Venom is a very entertaining Low budget film with some great visuals, amazing score and some very chilling atmospheres. The fact that they used real black mamba snakes in the film makes the viewing even more creepier- A very entertaining film with a great and violent ending...give it a try!"
3,A powerful thriller,"Even though this film is called ""Venom"" and features a snake, this is no ""creature feature."" Two English domestics (Oliver Reed and Susan George), along with an international criminal (Klaus Kinski), conspire to kidnap their wealthy employers' ten-year-old son. The plan goes awry after the boy mistakenly receives a highly aggressive, super-poisonous black mamba (originally intended for a research facility), which kills one of the conspirators and transforms the attempted kidnapping into a tense armed standoff. A box-office flop in its day, American audiences were probably turned off by the film's stodgy English production values and -- thanks to a misleading advertising campaign -- probably felt duped once they realized it wasn't a killer snake movie. Still, a strong script and Kinski and Reed's explosive performances make this a powerful thriller. Highly recommended.Three and a half stars out of five."
2,Great Cast Wasted,"Oliver Reed and his gang plan on kidnapping a rich kid. They screw things up and wind up having to take him hostage while the townhouse is surrounded by police. The kid has a pet poisonous snake which gets loose, but it is such a minor part of the story I think the title perhaps refers more to the bad temper of the guy Reed plays (or else some producer forced it upon the film).There is no suspense, barely any action, and no humour (intentional or otherwise). Mainly, characters argue with each other a lot and often stumble around since they keep all the lights off to evade being seen by the police."
5,wonderful rings,"These are for my Leupold 3x9-50 scope, and are really strong, fit perfectly. Seem strong enough that the 30-06 isn't likely to shake the scope loose, no matter what load I shoot. Wish the store locally had carried them, but got a better price on Amazon anyway!"
5,One of my favorite books,"This is a great book, definitely worth the money. I love reading, I always check the book section in stores and one day a few years ago, I was looking at the books in dollar tree and came across Rose by Lauren Royal. Obviously because I bought it from Dollar Tree I did not really think it would be that good, but I was pleasantly surprised. The first time I read this book, it took me about 2 days and I could not stop thinking about it. I would literally fall asleep wondering what would happen next. There are few books that I read more than once, but this book is one of those that deserves a second and third read."
2,The series seem to decline,"I liked book one, book two was okay and then a gradual decline. This book was just ho hum with a cast of forgettable characters. The writing was done well but the story lacked originality."
3,Overhyped Or Worthy Of The Praise?,"Brooklynite Mos Def (who along with Talib Kweli, spearheaded the commercial rise of ""underground"" rap in 1998) showcases his lyrical skills in this track lifted from the much-lauded ""Lyricist Lounge Volume 1"" compilation. Employing a spare jazzy backbeat and enlisting the vocal finesse of Q-Tip (of the late A Tribe Called Quest) as well as West Coast phenom Tash, this essentially serves as a rather skeletal primer to the aforementioned collection although this single does boast an instrumental for those so inclined."
4,"good representation, much props","this single is pretty tight, but then again- i love my old school jams. but it's a tight little jawn. if you like hip-hop you'll find yourself bobbing your head to this beat!"
2,Disappointing !,I wish I had read the review before ordering. The book is just a collection of simple shapes but no text or photos detailing the actual process. Like a sewing pattern without the intruction sheet.
2,Beware Of This Paperback,"Be warned, this is NOT a paperback book. It is better described as a 25 page A4 pamphlet describing five methods of formulating an expatriate compensation package. It is one of a series of pamphlets entitled ""BUILDING BLOCKS IN TOTAL COMPENSATION"", written by the American Compensation Association. The information is tightly focused on the subject title but it is not written for novice managers. The pamphlet is more of an introduction to payment schemes for use by individuals/groups who already have a substancial knowledge of compenstion schemes in general. Martin Wild, Muscat , Oman Feb 99."
1,Not a Hint of What Was to Come,Who would have thought the director of this load of tripe would go on to make 'Le Boucher' and 'Une Affaire de Femmes'?
4,Informative and eye opening,"I'm about halfway through this book. And so far I find it informative and very eye opening. It's given me amazing insight into the ""Politics"" of the Medical and research industries, plus, I no longer feel bad about having a glass of wine with my lunch."
5,A Jewel of the East that Should be Heard in the West,"I was walking through through shady shopping mall in Hong Kong looking for pirated software when I heard some bossa nova coming from a tiny record store no more than 9 metres squared. I asked the guy, who was playing? and he showed me this album.I immediately bought this one and two others by Lisa Ono. She's incredibly popular in the Far East being born in Japan to a father of Brazilian descent (I think). All of her music shines but this album just beats the lot.Here's my Lisa Ono story. The husband of my wife's best friend is an executive at MTV Europe. When they come round for dinner, we're always embarrassed by what music we're going to play knowing whatever it is won't make the grade with this guy. Knowing that he would have never heard of Lisa Ono, we put this album on fearing the worst. Result, he loved it and we spent the whole evening listening to the other 3 CDs."
5,"Excellent, Fun, Easy to Use","This is a great product. Super easy to use, friendly interface, and rich, detailed information presented in a fun way.As one with only a recent interest in astronomy, the product has been completely informative and advanced my knowledge greatly. I particularly like the guided tours which patiently explain all the constellations and nebulaes. A big favorite with my 8 year old is the 'spaceship', where you can travel the solar system and explore.I liked this so much that I bought a copy for my brother, who has been interested in astronomy for several years. He gives the program high marks as well, despite being much more advanced in the hobby than me.Overall, this is an excellent product."
2,It was ok. But...,"I gave it two stars because it did not work right. As I found out this program is not compatable with some operating sytems. It still doesn't work right with my windows 7 ultimate. If I was going to try this product, I would get the pro plus one. The one I got is more for kids.But keep your sales receipt. Because it may not work correctly."
5,My favorite live album of all time,"I have never heard music played like this.... ""Song of India"" might be the most perfect song I have ever heard. The music on this album makes the world a better place to live in"
5,a serious study of tati's career,don't expect to read the normal gossip-laden biography. this is a most serious text detailing the comic genius and cinematic philosophy of the brilliant and (almost) tragic actor/director.
1,"after one year, just making tea.","The water pumping was not good all the time. Still it worked so so for a few months. Then getting worse, now it makes dripped tea. Descaling does not help."
1,Waste of Money,Had this machine for 3 days and it stopped pumping water. I have a suspecion that the pump failed. Now I can get anyone to help me out with this broken $500 hunk of metal. Pretty useless as far a quality goes. Cheap construction and the steam spout is loose it feels likwe it will break off if you are not very careful.Bad product!!!
3,A very temperamental machine...,"I have this espresso machine for almost a year. A few months ago I replaced the Ulka pump. It is a very nice looking machine, grinder works ok, but I have never manage to pull dense, think crema espressos out of it. I have try many different techniques, coffees, tamper presures, with always so so results. With the steam is basically the same issue, sometimes works great, some others don't. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,"Looks 10, coffee 4","I first saw this machine in a shop window it Italy and I fell in love. When I found I could buy it here I was thrilled. But honestly, the performance has been a bit underwhelming. It is truly handsome but there is a steep learning curve, and at the end of the day it really only makes a pretty good cup at best...and that's on a good day. Forget a nice thick crema. If practice makes it any more perfect, I'll update this review later on."
3,Large being the key word here.,There are different sizes for these plastic thumb picks. These are large. They slip around a little when picking. I used a knife to cut little grooves in mine to keep it still on my thumb. Maybe a little boiling hot water will allow you to shape it to your thumb if you have smaller hands.
3,"not for everyone, but I still recommend it","If you have issues with your pick grip, start with these. The problem is that it might be large for small fingers, and this thin type might not provide the best sound for a beginner. But it's a good start for working on pick grip. This is the brand I have used in thumb picks (for guitar)."
5,very good read on economics,"Very interesting, simple and serious book that explains the fundamentals of modern economic system. Highly recommended for anyone interesting in reading."
4,"Down to earth, Data-driven","The book is surprisingly readable though written by 4 economists. I wish I would have had this book when I was taking my economics courses in college. It is very readable, and provides great, data-driven information on why the war on poverty hasn't worked, the downside of regulation and its negative impact on prosperity, and the need for re-thinking governments' role in economic management. Great book for business people, investors, or anyone looking for a primer on economics (macro and micro)."
5,MUST READ!,"You absolutely must read this book! Seriously. Read it. This book is very accessible no matter whether you are good or bad at math, or whether you are even particularly interested in economics. There are several sections - including one about personal finance - that will help you, if you listen to the brilliant and easy-to-understand advice. This is at the very top of the list of books I recommend to everyone!!"
3,Handbook of Balance,"This book was required for an AuD class. Some of the chapters are difficult to read and comprehend, but overall the organization was well done and every important topic of vestibular testing is covered."
1,Avoid!,"I bought this about a year ago and never played it until just the other day. Yeow! It could be that it is just my copy but the image is terrible! It might look all right on a smaller television or a computer screen but on my 70"" home theater set, forget it. The entertainers on stage display strange, vertical banding as they move about. I only kept it on for a few minutes....the sound seemed fine....but the picture was anything but acceptable. I saw the Barrage group live on stage and they were very entertaining and impressive....this DVD, sadly enough, is not."
5,A truly superb production,"I marvel at the other review of this DVD. We have a 42 inch TV and have not the slightest problem with the picture. The real issue here is the music. Basically, this is ""Blast"" with violins. It starts with an amazing exhibition of fiddle playing by about ten young fiddle players. From this point a story involves that gives reason for playing the tunes that are used. It is quite eclectic in that several styles are used. It is a truly superb performance that has been repeated world wide and has been extremely successful. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD."
1,Extremely Basic,"I felt that this book was a waste of money. Yes it gave an overview of the course, but it did not give enough information to actually help you study. The vocab terms were extremely basic. I suppose if you are just looking for practice tests it could be passable, but for studying purposes I would not recommend it."
5,Comprehensive AP Euro Preparation,"I purchased this book off of a recommendation from a friend who said that everything that you need to know for the AP test is in this book. He was right. I first read the information provided about the test itself. I began to read through the five chapters of history in the book while supplementing my reading with my class notes. My teacher, though, ran out of time to teach us history from about 1980s and onward, so all of my knowledge about that era came from this book, which allowed me to answer those questions on the test. The book also has practice multiple choice and essay questions that I informally sampled; they were suprisingly similar to the real test. Overall, this book has enough information in it alone to guarantee a 4 on the test, and possibly even a 5, which is what I received."
2,Mediocre Review Guide for a Very Extensive Exam,"I bought this book in January as a review for the AP Euro exam in May as well as to help me study for the class. It was of absolutely no use for the class and helped very little for the exam. The book did not include any of the released mulitiple choice questions and did not go into enough detail. I bought the Kaplan book for AP U.S. and found it to be much more comprehensive in comparison to the Princeton Review book for European. Luckily my European class prepared me enough for the test and I made a 5, though certainly not with the help of the Princeton Review book."
3,OK,"Grey has a pretty voice but I really hate it when she ""talks"" during a song. I fast forward to the next song."
1,"Eagerly anticipated, very disappointed","Recorded in 1968 and 1969, these cuts are what British Blues Fans' thought Champion Jack should sound like. The producer was deeply involved with the Bluesbreakers and brought in Mick Taylor and two of John Mayall's old drummers for one of the the sessions.I love Champion Jack, but about all you can hear from my man is his voice. The cuts are way over-produced. He's swamped by the sidemen. Usually you have to strain to hear the piano, and even that is pretty weak, knowing what the man could do. They actually brought in a string section on several cuts. Strings, if you can believe it! The live cuts they tacked onto the end are sad examples of him playing to a room full of drunk college boys.Friends, look elsewhere for the good stuff."
2,Not a satisfying finish to the trilogy,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the previous two books in this trilogy, I feel that the third volume falls somewhat flat. Kress alternates between two main storylines (one following Amanda Capelo, and the other following Lyle Kaufman) both of which are at best reactionary and at worst aimless. The absurdity of the plot devices in the Amanda storyline are only outdone by the impossibility of the plot devices in the Kaufman storyline. Motivations for the characters are often unclear.Halfway through the book, I was convinced that even the author had no idea where it was going. Somewhat late in the game (about page 200) the book does find its pacing and races to finish things off, but I found the conclusion unsatisfying.I would only recommend this book to fans of the first two books who are obsessive compulsive completists. Casual fans would be better off reading Kress' short fiction."
4,Pleasing conclusion to the trilogy,"I was sorry to see it end, and wish Ms. Kress would write another so we know what happens to our favorite couple on Mars, not to mention the famous physicist learning to cope with a headstrong fourteen-year-old daughter.The action really got intense there near the end, and was very imaginatively done. I was worried about that beforehand after encountering some of the padding and the verbatim paragraphs of science explanation from the previous books. A few typos, an incorrect attribution. Don't these things get any proofreading when they're popular? I guess not.Still a good read and I'd do it again. And probably (!) will with another Kress epic."
2,Firecracker boys were not the enemy.,AEC went there to see what would happen if a harbor was created there. They were only testing the feasibility of atomic bombs in use and effects.
4,"A tale of lovers, a tale of deception","Music:This movies songs are so captivating that just buying the dvd for the songs is worth it. The music envelops the viewer into a trance, with every song comes a new emotion, and this might just be my favorite album.Movie:Dhadkan is a very sweet film! Akshay Kumar is very good and plays Ram, Anjali's husband. Sunil Shetty is wonderful and plays Dev, Anjali's love. Shilpa Shetty gave a wonderful performance and plays Anjali. Mahima Choudary is excellent even though she has a small role. This film had drama all the way through it but it's very sweet and touching. The songs are very good and can touch your heart. This is a film is a must see for people who like love stories.Final:While the movie is not as captivating as it could have been the music keeps the movie at a set tempo, you will watch it once and then it will collect dust for 10 years until you decide to watch it because you forgot how it goes. (6.5/10)"
4,C-Rayz Walz - Ravipops,"Great album. I like most of the production on this album, real hiphop beats and loops etc. There was only like a COUPLE tracks I wasnt feeling but the rest were ill! Thats why it gets a 4 since I was feelin about most of the tracks! C-Rayz gots an ill flow and ill lyrics hands down. I recommend this album to all true hiphop fans, youll like this album alot. My fav track is ""Guns And Butter"", a fu**** ill beat!!My Top 5 Songs1.Guns And Butter2.Thug Melody3.864.Buck 805.YeahCheck this album!"
4,CD Purchase 12/06 - Ravipops,"Purchase/Process of order of CD was flawless. Confirmation of order great. Delivery was delayed (UPS) due to Holiday. Refund of shipping fee granted after requested. I will continue to do business with Amazon due to their amazing service, stock availability and attention to their customers needs."
5,A few breaths of fresh air!!!,"El-P knew what he was doing when he picked up C-Ray Walz. This kat is nice, not only is he extremely lyrical, he can combine that with good song writing. This album has many emotions built into it reminding me of albums done when EVERYTHING was hip hop, and there was no seperation between the underground and commercial world made so blatant. The complete album, stories, lyrical displays, posse cut, all done over dope beats. Pick this up if you know the real."
3,Not typical Def Jux fare,"I was surprised by the lack of experimentation on ""Ravipops"", but it's still a solid album. I doubt the majority of the Def Jux faithful is impressed with this LP, but in my opinion, there's definitely a time and place for it. With a low retail price (around ten bucks everywhere I've seen), ""'86"", ""Buck 80"". ""We Live"", and ""3 Card Molly"" make this album worth the money. Musically, ""Ravipops"" doesn't break any new ground, but C-Rays is a more than capable lyricist, and it's refreshing to hear some straightforward raw tracks from a Def Jukie. Fans of El-P, Aesop Rock, Rjd2, etc, might be disappointed in ""Ravipops"", but in my opinion, the addition of C-Rays simply diversifies the already-solid Jux roster."
1,Mysery Stories,Was excited about the title and thought my 8-year old grandson would enjoy it. Was very disappointed when I read the first story in the book and sure his Mom would not approve the choice. The story was appropriately written for a child but dealt with death of a sibling from what appeared a non-religious perspective.
2,Fell apart in first 5 minutes of use,"It looked okay, but within a few minutes of use the end of the brush came off leaving it stuck at full length inside of the plastic tube I was cleaning. Now this wasn't a press fit so there really wasn't much pressure on the brush that would have caused it to come off. It just came disconnected from the long steel rod. No way to fix it that I could see or trust that it wouldn't happen again. Donated it to the trash can. Maybe two stars is too much."
3,Gets the job done until it falls apart,"Lasted a while before falling apart. First, it started losing bristles, then the end snapped off. Probably doesn't help that I frequently curved the bristle-end of the brush to reach tough spots, sometimes even folding it in half. For under $5, I'll just order another one."
3,Cute. Mediocre adhesive...,The bright colors help get lots of attention to owies. But they tend to come off too soon too easily.
5,"Might be the best of the ""insiders"" view on Watergate ...","I must second the review of the reader from Malibu...a must read! Haldeman shows again (like in the ""Haldeman Diaries"") his human side and not the rigid company man that he's always made out to be. The break-in and subsequent cover-up (or as Haldeman says ""containment"") are explained with an insiders perspective and in what I must say, the best and most clarifying way that I've read (there's still a lot on Watergate that I haven't read though...). The only critique that I might make is I wonder how much of this was J.Dimona? S. Ambrose's ""Ruin and Recovery"" explains that Haldeman, in later years, refuted this book and it's conclusions and, if true, that would be a shame as the conclusions drawn from this book make the most sense given the advantage of over 20 years perspective. Even though this was published in 1979, many copies are still available and can be gotten for very reasonable prices ... so I'd again recommend this book highly."
5,How to let your baby from crying to smiling?,"This is a wonderful DVD! My 5 months old boy love it very much. When I turn it on, he will from crying to smiling and dancing. He like to watch everday. This little money is worth it, can let your hand free for a while."
4,A wonderful performance,"Alvin's voice isn't for everyone, but his songwriting and guitar playing are some of the best around. This is a record with a wonderful sound and a great overall feel. The highlight for me is ""Abilene,"" but there seem to be plenty of other opinions. That is the sign of a excellent record."
2,OEM???,"Original had silicone boots and were numbered.These are ok but the coil wire(both of them.........yes 2) did not fit original coil,the boot is to small.Yes i had it on both ways!!"
2,Stand Is A Piece Of CRAP,"Monitor OK as TV, Not the greatest as a PC monitor though. Passable in a pinch. Stand is an absolute piece of CRAP. It cracked after the first couple of uses right at the tilt pivot point. Now the TV won't stay up by itself. The weight of the unit make the monitor tilt down. Very bad design flaw that I can not understand how it got passed QC in a Japanese factory. Usually the Japanese are quite anal about proper design and QC :-("
4,Good practical ideas,"There are a lot of good practical tips that I liked in this book such as using fabric backdrops instead of paper incase of 'accidents'and how using natural brown tones enhances fur. Also how it's a good idea to use a low table for the animal to stand on, not too low that they jump off but not too high that they think they are at the vets. I would say this book is aimed more at established studio photographers wanting to branch into pet photography rather than novices wanting to learn how to photograph animals.I would've liked a little bit more information for someone starting out but it is full of very good tips."
1,a strategy guide for how to bungle game development,"this strategy guide for a game never produced. If MS hadn't handed off the development of this game to another company, which couldn't handle it, then handed it back, perhaps this game would actually exist. MS does not plan at this time to take it off the shelf and resume development. unfortunately, that leaves us with MS Train Simulator 1, and Auran's Train Simulator 2004. Luckily both are fine products. But something new might be nice."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I'm a self-employed graphic designer who was recently commissioned to redesign a magazine. Looking for inspiration, I bought this book but was sorely disappointed to find no magazine layouts whatsoever-this book is pure photography. No editorial spreads, text layouts, headlines-nothing of the sort you'd expect with a title of ""Magazine Design."" To boot, there were 4 images of bare-breasted women in the first few pages I flipped through - these editors clearly have an aesthetic to push, which I don't share. I returned it immediately."
1,horrible!,"It is one of the most disgusting book I have read. Just cheap. I got through about more than a half of this book, tried to finish it, but at some point it got so bad than I just put it down, luckily I didn't buy it, borrowed from the library. Don't waste your money! Only gossip, only scandal, like reading tabloids."
1,Wish I hadn't bought it,"I have been collecting books on Michael Jackson, and didn't realize this one was tabloid trash. I should have come here and investigated it before I purchased it. Now I want to get rid of this one! Trash! Luckily I just spent a dollar or so on this ""book.""Read Aphrodite Jones' book, Conspiracy, and Redemption. They give the TRUE picture of Michael and exonerate him of all this tabloid trash. This author is not a journalist. Just a fiction writer."
2,really?,So this book is basically half truths and half facts. The made up stuff is some of the craziest i have ever read... Michael relieves himself in his pants... the sexual allegations.. and then someone is quoted saying he may have molested bubbles?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME.. Dont waste your money on this book... all its really good for is some good pictures of MJ.
3,Great information!,Great information on Michael Jackson's life...is it all true? I don't know...you be the judge!
4,Interesting reading,"I am a MJ fan, but still enjoyed reading the book. Some of the stuff was sensational, but it did seemed well researched. Some of the people interviewed had negative information but if they were fired employees, ect. I didn't believe all of it. Still it was interesting reading. MJ was a very interesting person."
1,Be cautious!,"I read the book. Yes, it DOES give much real information... The Jackson family tree, how to find Neverland if you'd like to see the gates of it...But IT`S DISCUSTING! It's mentioning the Curdoys (did I spell it right?)the garden keepers, as ""good wittnesses"" in the case. In truth the police interviewed them, and read their ""MJ's questionable acts""-diary, but found it (diary) VERY questionable in itself.Brett Barnes, Wade Robson, Jimmy Safechuck and Sean Lennon were all appearantly ""victims"" of MJ according to the book. None of them have accused MJ of wrongdoing, no-one, has except for the Chandler-FATHER, not before and not to this date accused jackson of ANY wrongdoing against minor juveniles! Keep that in mind! Peace."
1,Completely Filthy!,"This book is absolutely disgusting! The author is the one with the perversion.There is no valid sources, nothing solid. His own opinion. He doesn't even try to make this book believable, Saying Jackson enjoys relieving himself in his pants. Come on? The book is more than vulgar!"
1,Garbage!,"I felt that this author just wanted to nail MJ to the wall!! He obviously hates MJ with such passion, I could feel it in the way the book was written. It was the first book I have read that I burned! Freedom of the Press had nothing to do with this book, it was totally abusive and very unfair to MJ. If I had my way, I would find every single copy out there and have an official book burning. I wouldn't even rate it as a 1 star!! Anderson is a very cruel person and I strongly feel that this garbage should not have been published in the first place."
5,Great,"This book, written in 1994, was ahead of its time. In it it mentions Jackson`s pill addiction even way beack in the 80s. Alot of Jackson fans back then just didn`t (or couldn`t) believe that he was addicted to drugs and so they just flipped this book off as nonsense. But, as we now know, the truth has finally come out and Jackson was highly addicted to prescribed drugs, it`s what possibly killed him. There`s some interesting information about his child molestation charges in 1993. There`s even some rare pictures of michael holding hands with young boys. This book will probably never ever get released again so i would highly recommend you track it down if you want to know more about jackson`s offstage life. And michael Jackson fans will probably not like what they read in this book. Much of the info in this book will get swept under the carpet and the Jackson family will hope that none of this information in this book ever surfaces again."
1,a Book without Merit,this Book is pointless&has nothing to offer.How Christopher Anderson even got a deal to do this Book is a Mystery to me.Yeah MJ has His Issues but this Book only Reflects a negative Vibe not a full View of this very important Musical Artist.Avoid this Book at all Costs.
4,"Great item, poor shipping.","Got a great price on the fuel pump,but paid extra for a guaranteed shipping date which was a day late. I was supposed to be reimbursed for the shipping if it was late, but that has not happened yet. Probably will not buy again."
1,Terrible - NOT FOR AIRSOFT - Gave them 1 star because theres no 0!!!!,**Update**- They have COMPLETELY changed this product. These are not the goggles I purchased.These goggles are terrible-1) They are not meant for airsoft- they are not impact rated and the lens flexes a ridiculous amount.2) they arrived in terrible condition- there were threads hanging off all over the place- the strap is disintegrating - IVE NEVER USED THEM!!!!!3) They are actually counterfeit- They have a smith logo on teh frame- I assure you these are not Smith.An absolute waste of $13.
5,"best cd out, needs to make a new one with more recent hits","loved the cd, thought it was sold out, has wonderful songs my favorite being Callin' Baton Rouge"
5,A must have for any CD collection!,"I am not a huge fan of country music, however, I am a fan of some of the country music greats, such as Reba, Dolly, and now Garth. This CD has every song of his that I love, and the songs that got me hooked on Garth. I am just waiting for his next greatest hits album! Garth is here to stay and this CD will show you why so many have come to know and love his music."
4,This was a pritty good one!!,"I think that all the people did a good job on the cd, but I think that they could have done a better job at salecting the songs that they did. Like ""We Shall Be Free"", and I think that sogns like ""The Lonsome Dove and things like that should be. I also think that they should make another CD of greatest hits with the newer songs that he has been abole to sign."
1,That's It,A collection of forgettable songs that will go down in history as ? These tunes won't be played on any radio station within three years. Already their play time lags.
5,The best collection of his work.,Garth has many albums but by far I feel that this one is his best. The collection on this CD has been played for countless hours and if it were a tape it would have been replaced many times over. You will love this one.
5,Fantastic Display Of Showmanship,Garth is without a doubt;the greatest performer; country;pop;rock;etc.to have come along since music was invented.
3,Garth Brooks- The Hits,"Prompt delivery. CD plays perfectly, no scratches. The case is a little wobbley, but not bad. I'm really happy!"
1,This Is The Kenny G Of Country!,"I simply do not understand what all the fuss is about with this man. There are much better country acts out there which deserve more media attention than Brooks garners. His songs are soulless (Barry Manilow likes him, so it must be so) and unenjoyable. The hype machine is in overdrive for this guy. He is the Kenny G of country. His act is unchallenging, tries too hard to pander to his audience, and is a misrepresentation of his genre of music."
1,not fit for human consumption,"Yes, from the cover art to the dreadful songs to Garth's lacking voice...this album fails on all levels. Garth seems stuck between being an authentic country singer, and pandering to a broader mainstream. Unfortunately he falls short everywhere, failing to please the true country fan and the mainstream simultaneously."
2,What's this?,"Strange, strange album. Yes, it's a ""Back to Mine"" album, but its still an odd collection of tracks. The disc is all over the board. Truly, it sounds like a collection your 40-yr old uncle would put together. Yes, the songs, by themselves, are all classics in their own right. But do they flow here? Not really. Do they create a ""vibe"" that has anything remotely to do with Underworld. No.Buy this album if you want a decent mix tape of a wide range of musical styles - put together by Underworld. Don't buy it because you like Underworld music."
4,A visit to the underworld,"What a cool album. Quirky and delightful, though there's some tracks ripe for the skippin'. This is what the Back to Mine series is about - getting back to inspiration and influence. This album does not disappoint."
2,Not my favorite from my favorite,"I'm a big Underworld fan, and also a fan of the Back to Mine series, however this one just didn't do it for me. I don't think it's Underworlds best production work, and I hardly listen to it at all. That being said, sometimes when I sit on things for a while and listen to them again, I like them. I'm not packing it away, but for now it's disappointing."
4,Nino Cochise,This was a very interesting man. He went from the days of fighting soldiers from horseback to being an extra in movies about fighting soldiers from horseback and on to piloting an airplane. He was still alive living in Arizona in 1973 and I regret going within 40 miles of his trading post without taking time to detour and meet him.
5,Great undiscovered story,"This is a fun, informative, and easy read. You will be glad you read it. As a child Nino Cochise is with a small band who avoid being lead to the reservation. He spends decades with a fragment of the tribe, mostly in Mexico. Don't want to give away the highlights, but the self-reliance and determination to survive hardship are amazing. As the world changes with times, so does the community, until times change too much. A warrior, leader, and respected chief who cares for his tribe. It's just a great story and an amazing man."
3,"I read it 30 years ago, still have my copy.",It is a paperback and falling apart. I read it over and over. I hope it is real. I don't see how it couldn't be. Even if it isn't the way Apaches are portrayed as real people struggling to survive is invaluable. I grew up in the old Commanche/Kiowa/Apache reservation in Oklahoma with many poeple decended from those people who suffered in their struggle. They are just folks you know so I figured their ancestors were real people too and not hollywood. Sure there were atrocities committed by people on both sides but this book was my first glimpse at Indians as good guys when I first read it as a kid back in the 70's. So I am looking for another copy.
1,I don't recommend it,"Who is that guy? Actually, nobody knows. Historical facts? None is correct. The author puts people in one place (Mexico) while the very same real persons were registered and documented to have been at other places. If you are interested in history, look for other authors. If you just like wild west stories, this one is not even well invented. Disappointing."
4,A beautiful story!,Can You Feel The Thunder is a wonderful book that captures the essence of acceptance. Children and adults alike will never look at another person the same way again.
4,very good and soulful,this to me is one of the essential BlackStreet jams. vocally they were truly onto something when they first came out. there harmony was on point. this is still the cut and I was grooving to this jam a week ago. strong production and a cool overall flow.background vocals were on point as well. another classic Teddy Riley production.
1,Huh?,"I don't get it. I've listened to as much of this guy's music as I could stomach. His voice is certainly nothing to write home about. The music is amateurish/boring as hell. I think I pretty much resonate with what he has to say -- but I don't find anything clever or engaging in the way he says it.Maybe he's one of those artists you have to see live to really appreciate. I have to admit that from his pictures, he seems to have great hair (Dana, dude - who's your stylist?)Even though it was written more than a generation ago,I find Tom Lehrer's stuff from the 60's (TWTWTW) to be far more clever, insightful, musically interesting (although he couldn't sing worth a damn either), and relevant."
2,different quality of fruit of the looms products,I have purchased other fruit of the loom boxer briefs and these that I just purchased are less in quality than I purchased at a store.
3,they aight,"like i said before, they aight. they're underwear, you can't really go wrong. not particularly soft though :("
2,Not what I wanted.,"The construction and fabric are less than what I was looking for. I returned them and found something better at the local discount store. Also, the image showed ""trunks"" but what was shipped were shorter in the legs and not at all what was described in the ad."
3,Good but not great,The good is that the sizing is accurate and they are fairly comfortable. The bad is that they don't hold up very well. Not so bad that they're not worth getting but more of a 'you get what you pay for' type of thing. The reason for 3 stars is that they basically are perfectly average.
3,Meh - not bad,"Not bad, but they have the tendency to stretch out in the legs over a long day of use. They unfortunately can't stand up to my favorite champion boxer briefs."
4,What I wanted with an exception.,These are the exact style I was hoping to get. I bought some at a department store a while back and they fit great. I only bought 1 package and of course when I went back to the store they were no longer carrying them. They had some that are similar but are trunks and I like the legs to be longer.One minor negative thing about this offering is that the Heather Grey which is 90% cotton and 10% polyester is a little bit bigger than the rest. Even after washing and drying them on high heat they didn't change in size. I will just use them when I wear tighter jeans that don't need the extra support.
3,Tsar: The Lost World Of Nicholas And Alexandra,"Unfortunately I imagined this book to be much better than what it really is. It is worth having a good look at, but I rather regretted actually buying it.There are photographs on every page, but don't expect to see a lot of rare ones. One delight was seeing the photographs of the palaces in the day of the Romanovs, compared to photographs of the palaces today. The book is presented nicely, is big and thick, there is a lot of text, but there was truly something missing from this book. It was also even more disappointing to see how much Peter Kurth included on Anna Anderson. Even though DNA tests have proved her to be a fraud, it seems that Peter Kurth points out every little thing which would try to make the reader believe that Anna Anderson was indeed Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicolaevna.It is perhaps a nice book, but I say that there are definitely better books on the Imperial Family out there."
2,A beautiful disappointment,"I was so excited when I received this book. However, within the first few pages, my excitement gave way to disappointment. Mr. Kurth clearly does not view the Romanovs in high regard and makes that clear throughout the book. In addition, the photographs are all well known, nothing rare. I was quite annoyed to have to read a chapter regarding ms. Anderson's story. Apparently Mr. Kurth didn't think his previous work, which dealt entirely with Anna Anderson, was sufficient. He insists, yet again, that this mentally ill imposter is indeed the slain Grand Duchess. He also makes it clear that dislikes the empress, Alexandra, in particular. As a supporter of Alexandra, I found his statements abut her to be harsh and a bit offensive. An acceptable add to your Romanov library, but otherwise nothing positive to say for this work."
5,Lost Splendor,Wonderful book for any Romanov enthusiast. Pictures are great. There is nothing new in this book but the fact of having so much all in one place is great and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this time period in Russia and the entire westernized world.
4,A wonderful portrait of a lost world!,"Peter Kurth is a careful and balanced historical writer whose opinions I value and whose descriptiions are fabulous. Combined with authentic photos of a lost and lavish world makes the reader feel like they have stepped back in time. This is a great coffee table book to introduce friends and family to Imperial russia, but there is enough solid information to make it a reference book, too. A highly enjoyable read!!"
5,A Glimps into a Lost World,"Having just returned from St. Petersburg Russia I was looking for a book just like this one. This is a book which provides a lovely history of the family which ruled Russia for over 300 years and whose fall was as dramatic as that of the Bourbons in France. This book is well documented with many beautiful photos which will transport the reader to an age that is no more. You get a good idea for what life was once like for the Russian aristocrats, and their Czar. From Balls, to dinners, to Czar Nicholi's families' death you see the photographic evidence and a well written account within the pages of this book. Not only is it a well written book, but also a nice addition to your coffee table. I find myself thumbing through it constantly just to admire the photographs. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good, but!","I've read this book, and the writing is fine and the pictures are beautiful, BUT, the author spoils the end with his final chapter, reiterating his strongly held belief that Anna Anderson was the Grand Dutchess Anastasia, which to me is just a stupid belief. No one got out of that charnel house that was Ekaterinburg. This last chapter just has no place in this book (he's already written about a whole book about it, anyway) and it spoils the book for me. But this is purely a personal opinion and the rest of the book is very good; especially juxtaposing certain photographs of various palaces, etc. with their present-day appearance."
4,A Good Book For Those That Like History And Pictures,This is a great book if you like history and the personal pictures that go with history. The story of this family is so tragic and this book covers both the personal and public lives of the last Tsar of Russia. I found it very interesting with pictures that are from the families own personal albums plus newer picturs taken in present day. This is a great book if you are interested in this part of history. Beautifully put together it will make a great addition to any personal library.
3,Eugh..,"While the photographs are excellent, the text is awful. Peter Kurth, who most likely was influenced by stupid stories from his friend Francizka Shanzkowska, pretty much bashes Nicholas, Alexandra, and even their children. For those who are Romanov buffs, I for one found the text rather irritating...and, of course, since it's Kurth, he had to draw out the whole Anna Anderson affair. Alas, this had a chance for being good, but with so much negative stuff written about pretty much everyone that's written about (many comments about how the Imperial Family were all just a collection of idiots and how the children could barely speak Russian, English or any of the other languages they knew, etc), well, it goes down the tube fom there."
3,"Good quality prints, but awful software problems!!!","I bought this printer 2 years ago, thinking that since it was so expensive (almost $400) and I had previously only had good experiences with HP, that it was a safe bet. Boy was I wrong!!The printer does make great quality photos, but it goes through ink very quickly, and the ink isn't cheap.Also, every time the drivers need to be updated, the printer causes our computer to freeze up, so in order to use the computer, we have to unplug the printer. This wouldn't be a problem, except that if you want to update the drivers, the PRINTER HAS TO BE PLUGGED IN! Therefore, every time this happens (third time and counting) we have to take it to Best Buy and have the Geek Squad guys upload the new drivers! WHAT A ROYAL PAIN!!This printer is not worth the money. make your life easier and get the Kodak EasyShare docking printer. I will, and I'll never buy an HP ever again."
1,A horrible printer,"I cannot find anything good to report about this printer, except that it was easy to set up. All of the moving parts just feel cheap and junky, like they are ready to break at any moment. The print cartridges jam about 50% of the time. Photos are printed crooked on the paper (on a slight diagonal). There are orange and yellow lines through the middle of the photos. I have had so much wasted paper because the printer decides to spit out sheets of random letters at any time. This printer is going back."
5,Good printer,"I have had this printer for about a month now. I would rate this very good. I have been printing 11 x 8.5 inch pictures and the colors are bold, and the picturs come out very sharp. The paper you use does make a difference as the pictures are even more sharp with the HP glossy paper. Everyone I show these pictures to is very impressed by the quality this printer can produce. Be warned though, at the size that I am printing, the black photo ink cartridge(usually 1/3 full) that came with my printer is almost used up after about ten or twelve 11 x 8.5 inch full DPI pictures. I expected to use a lot of ink though at those print sizes on the max DPI and am more concerned with printing large, vibrant photos than conserving ink."
1,The decline of HP,"Having owned several HP printers over many years, I have noticed a steady and unforgivable decline in the quality of this company's printers with each successive model. The final straw for me is the 7960, by far the worst HP printer I have owned. While producing acceptable prints under most conditions, this printer's liabilities far outweigh its benefits. The workmanship of the unit itself is the flimsiest and most disappointing I have encountered. And the printer's lack of consistent compatibility with the two separate computers I have used it with is both annoying and inexcusable for a supposedly renowned printer company. Bad drivers have caused numerous problems and the driver updates usually make the situation only marginally better. Plus the printer's general overuse of ink and poor paper and envelope handling make the overall experience of owning one distinctly unappealing. This is my last HP printer - I'll be switching to Epson."
5,HP Photosmart 7960 Printer and Outstanding Customer Service,"I must say that this is one of the best amazon transactions I have ever done--it has been outstanding all the way through. Bedamax answered my many questions prior to the sale and was very responsive. I ordered the printer and he shipped same day. It arrived before time alloted and was the best packing job I have ever seen, extremely well packaged and protected. It was shipped across the country and arrived in perfect condition. All the pieces and brochures were included. The new printer is really outstanding and I am so happy with the quality of the pictures. Bedamax provided exemplary customer service, was helpful and courteous throughout the process, and delivered a high quality product on time. Thank you for such outstanding service and this great printer."
2,Disappointing HP - Canon Outperforms.,"I seem to be one of the few disappointed by the HP 7960. I found the photo print quality lacked depth. The machine itself felt too light weight, the intertia of the printing caused it to skid across the desk. The machine was prone to paper jamming. After a week, I returned it in favor of a Canon i900D.The Canon machine is much more substantial and gives much warmer pictures. Downsides - LCD isn't as clear as it could be and the machine takes a little longer to set up. Overall though, the Canon is the winner. (especially as it is almost $100 cheaper)"
5,Easy to use!,"I'm very impressed by the straight forward design and navigation of the HP PhotoSmart 7960. Very easy to use and figure out, even if you're a technophobe like myself. Out of the box it was easy to set up with the step-by-step poster that they provided. Right away I was printing vacation photos straight from my compact flash (with the printer's default settings, without being hooked up to a computer) and I got really good printouts.Pros: The LCD display is bigger than most digital cameras and is very clear, navagation is straight forward and easy to figure out, the color range is good (considering there's ""8 colors""), very easy to use.Cons: It comes with color cartridges that combine colors (CMY, Light-CMY, Grey or Black) so if you run out of one color you have to replace the whole thing. On glossy photo paper the overall color tends to be a bit darker. And at the moment it's a bit pricy compared with it's competition."
1,Zero star. Should not be sold at all.,"It's very dark. You can hardly see or hear anything. It's a complete waste of my money. I felt I was cheated.Oh, the cover was printed very well."
2,Not what I expected from an Easy Spirit shoe,I purchased this Easy Spirit shoe expecting a nice comfy shoes but was totally disappointed. I wore it a couple of times for work and could barely walk after a few hours. I got a medium/wide fit but it was very tight in the front squeezing my hammer toes. It looked nice but did not provide any comfort at all...
2,Nice espresso but...,"Machine is significantly overpriced for build quality. Weighting is incorrect, i.e. the unit is not balanced properly. When you ""pump"" the espresso the machine wants to tip over. The frother position and function is subpar.However, it did make the espresso well! Nice crema and surprisingly easy to use given the concerns people give you re: using a pump machine."
5,MODERN,"HELLO,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO FEEL LOST IN COMMERCIAL FEA-SOFTWARE TUTORIALS."
5,Unbelieveably Awesome!,"This man was way before his time. Anything you can get your hands on to read from Neville, I recommend doing so!"
4,A great teacher for his times,Very prolific for his generation. Way ahead of the conventional way of thinking in his time. It is a book that you have to read at least 4 or 5 times. And than you might GET IT.
5,Best Book By Far On LOA.,"This book is an EXCELLENT example on how to succeed in using the Law of Attraction to get what you want out of life! Neville Goddard cites LOTS of examples of people that have successfully followed his teachings and achieved their hearts' desires. By far, the most useful part of this book are the case studies using his principles. One woman manifested her desire in 48 HOURS! I have to go now and type out all of the case studies so I have a blueprint for my ""desires to come""."
5,well said,The Neville Reader has helped tremendously as I travel through my spiritual journey. Expect to reread in some parts in order to truly understand this great experience. I strongly recommend for any person looking for true purpose in life.
5,Fantastic information,It has to be said that as a mystic Neville is in a whole different dimension. Fabulous information with biblical references included but not so much that a non-Christian would be put off by it. His teachings on the power of the imagination are life-altering. This is a must-read for any metaphysician. Peace and love!
4,A Fine Neville Anthology,"Neville Goddard was a rare bird, even among twentieth century mystics. Not enough is known about his upbringing in Barbados, and what specifically compelled him toward the New Thought Movement and away from his New York theatrical career. According to Neville, the ascended master who became his teacher was awaiting him.Any serious student of Manifestation, New Thought, Law of Attraction, etc. should not be without this fine compendium of Neville's words...and should seek further, namely to recordings of Neville's public lectures. His voice delivers his convincing rhetoric and case histories elegantly. Once one hears it, returning to the written words, that voice echoes within, as though Neville himself was speaking aloud again, from each page.Astute learners would do well to have significant grounding in Old and New Testaments and Kabbalah, as did the author, himself. Some of his subtler assumptions bespeak a pedagogy that far outranks his more popular contemporaries."
4,"Great Collection, Bad Grammar","Great collection of Neville's writings, some of his more brief (shorter) books are my favs. They are all here. Bad puncuation throughout, can be annoying and confusing at some parts. But readable. I cannot believe that this made is past the editor like it did. Not a bad price for all you get. Think I am going to purchase some of my more favorite writings separately (that have been released by a different publisher though.)"
3,The Neville Reader,I did not order this product and do not have this product. It might be a great book but not for me. Thank you.
4,One of the best gamecube games..25yo,"Ive been searching for a good gamecube game now for quite a while. I realy enjoyed Medal of Honor Frontline but found Medal of Honor the Rising Sun to be very disapointing. I couldnt get into Call of Duty and was at the stores ready to buy myself an xbox when i sore this game on sale. And this game is fantastic, The game controls are much easier to master, the graphics are better, the maps are more fun, but like other reveiws say, I do find some missons quite short. I also like the fact that you can store your medical kits and use them at a later stage."
4,Excellent Medal Of Honor entry....,"What is the biggest improvement over the other 2 Gamecube MOH games? You can now look down your gun sights (ala Call Of Duty). No more ""side shooting"" enemies. The graphica are top notch and the enemy AI is very good. Sounds are as excellent as well. The German soldiers love to yell out ""Americana!"" or ""Grenada!"" and the weapons sound deadly. I would rate this just below Call Of Duty Big Red One as a MUST OWN for shooter fans."
5,Great Game!!!,"I love MOH: European Assualt! The graphics are VERY good for the GameCube and the missions are very diverse. Love the weapons, sound quality for them is excellent. Nice layout of the Lifeline meter, ammunition capacity, etc. on the screen. Especially nice and where this game really triumphs Call of Duty, is the weapon sights: turns red when focused on the enemy (though no guarantee you'll smoke him) and the ""magnify"" feature is much better here. Was disappointed when I finally finished all the missions but am having almost as much fun going through them again."
5,MOVE OVER DA VINCI CODE!,"A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the pictures found especially in the appendix of this book are PRICELESS!These pictures depict religious sects, secret organizations and strange looking beings along with one interesting picture of Edward Leedskalnin working an unusual machine while wearing a strange metal mask.There is also one profound picture that is not only astounding but mind opening.Who would have ever had the insight to mirror the everyday pictures published in the forgotten past bt Edward Leedskalnin to reveal a path to his hidden life for all to see and comprehend?What a find!"
1,Perfect example of misinformation,"If you don't want to be lead far off of the trail of any useful insight on ED.L.'s works, then don't waste your time on this book. This book takes possible evidence and steers it in the wrong direction so as to mislead anyone who doesn't use their judgement while reading it, and causes anyone who sees through the misinformation such distaste for the subject that they are deterred from doing any real research into ED.L.'s writtings. I believe that this book was made with the intent to mislead and I am very insulted that the writer would think that anyone would take this book seriously. The author's stile of taking blind shots in the dark when ""decoding"" ED.L.'s writting is so random that the same methods could easily be used to make ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" look like Nazi propaganda."
1,Coral Castle- How to Read His Writings,"How To Read His Writings: The Unauthorized Guide to Decoding Edward Leedskalnin's WorksDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This author needs to write a book on How to read his own writings, man it was painful. Do yourself a favor and just get the original writings of Edward Leedskalnin from the Coral Castle Store:Coral Castle, Edward Leedskalnin, Magnetic Current Book, Magnetic Current Insert, Magnetic Current Advertisement, A book in every home, Mineral Vegetable and Animal Life."
1,Never got it,I will as soon as you people send it to me.I've only been bitching about this for months now.
2,Leasves marks on the wood.,I have used Porter Cable quicksand sanders for years and they work great. I was searching for one and came across this sander. I figured since it was Porter Cable it must be a good product. I was wrong. I am a cabinetmaker and need a sander that leaves my work in finish ready condition. This sander leaves my woodwork with swirl scratches so bad that the staining looks horrible. I had to go to a local home store and pick up another sander to correct this mistake. It was a Makita sander and it did the job as good if not better than the old quicksand sanders. I guesss i will be buying Makita sanders from now on.
1,Obsolete!,"I bought this sander (Porter Cable 344 5"" random orbital sander with PSA pad) and then discovered that it is nearly impossible to find 5"" 8 hole adhesive disks. Ace Hardware is the only place I have found them and they are about a buck a piece. Go with the hook and loop sander.Having said that, the sander works great and the hook and loop version of this same sander would be even better."
3,very relaxing,"This a good CD - I've tried absolutely everything to get my daughter to fall asleep on her own - she's nearly 5 years old now, I think it's about time. This didn't work either, but it's very soothing and my daughter definately drifted off to sleep much faster. I often drifted off too. I liked it alot, but it certainly didn't teach her to sleep any better."
4,Floppy CD Works - Sometimes,"It was taking my 4 year old daughter up to 4 hours to fall asleep. She seemed to recharge once she hit the pillow and her imagination kicked into overdrive. The first night she listened to this CD she was asleep within a half hour. The next night she refused to listen to it because she already heard it. She refused it several more nights, and we didn't want to force the issue.Then one night she asked for it herself and it worked again. Now, she asks for it several nights per week, and it seems to get her to fall asleep within a half hour. It's good for her to direct her imagination to something calming which leads her into to sleep. And this CD really does help her relax and fall asleep. She has to be in the mood for it though.So, in general I would say, this hasn't been a miraculous CD as I had hoped but I believe it really can work overtime. If you get it and at first it doesn't work, I encourage you to gently and occassionally try to reintroduce it.Good luck!"
3,My girls didn't like it,"It may work for others, but my girls did not like it and one girl complained that the second track gave her a headache. It wasn't for us!"
2,Ok,The music is nice and soothing. Please note that the CD is only 20 minutes. I don't think it is worth the 12.99
2,This CD is retarded and the narrator sounds psychotic,"I think this cd is overpriced. It's only 20 minutes and the price is the same as an artist's cd, which is usually about 60 min. Think about all the work that goes into an artist's album compared to this repetitive babbling narrated by a woman who sounds possessed for much of the time. I personally can't stand this and the sound of her voice makes me cringe. I bought this for a 9 yr old boy and after I put it on, I had to get out of the room right away. The cd isn't very effective and I think he thinks it's pretty lame. Maybe this would be better for ages 2-6. We won't be buying any more Patti Teel albums."
5,Sleepy Is A Sleeper!,"Wonderful! I recently received the CD for my 2-1/2 year old twin sons. Though they are pretty good sleepers, I felt that my wife and I, along with my boys, could benefit from the interaction that the CD encourages. The CD has become an integral part of our night time ritual. My one son frequently requests, ""Floppy music Daddy....pleassssssssse!"" (I even think they sleep better too!) Thank you Ms. Teel for your relaxing technique and for assisting in the development of my children. Buy it for your family - and for every friend with little children!"
1,Very poor quality. Could not punch holes in leathr belt,I purchased the product in order to punch holes in my belts as I am loosing weight. It was not strong enough to do the job
4,Hole Punch,Arrived fast and worked as advertised. Punched quality holes for installing snap fasteners. Look to be very sturdy and well made.
2,hanging chads,It does not make clean holes unless I use very strong grip and twist it around. the base plate and hole blades do no match
2,It Still works,The product broke the third time I used itIt still works but you need to be real carefulIt does not lock anymore
5,Great little product!,"I always ending up adding holes on my belts, so the knife-stub method had to stop. I bought this tool and it is better than its description. It matches the hole size and it allows you to center the hole with great ease!The seller was great as well. Good job!"
3,does the job,makes it easy to adjust the belts to make them fit better. Requires some work to get the holes right and clean.
4,"Very good seller, but the product itself is not quite satisfying","Very good seller, fast shipping. However, the leather hold puncher itself is a little bit less than satisfying, requires a lot of extra force to actually making a hole on the belt, and the cut isn't quite neat either."
5,i really like the leather hole puncher it works verry well thank u verry much.,the leather hole puncher is one of the best thangs on the market so u have too get one.
5,Leather Punch,"The item arrived promptly, well packaged, and I found it to be as advertised. It worked well for the purpose for which I purchased it, and I have no complaints about the item, or the purchasing process. I found it to be a good value for the price I paid."
4,Great little gadget,I went to every hardware and craft store in my area and was not able to find a leather hole puncher. This tool did exactly what I needed it to do and it's so affordable. I'm very satisfied.
3,I works fine for me. Had an issue but solved it,"Shipping was fast. The tool had an issue:The safety lever would not open. It was too long so it was not possible for it to slide/turn to open position. Had to use my file to file it down to correct length so it would turn open.After that mod, it worked fine.Punches holes through leather with no problems at all and the tips are sharp enough.In my case, I had to fix it and made it work. So I rated it as OK (3 stars out of 5) because the price was right. You get what you pay for.Now I am happy with it."
1,Not worth it,"Will not recommend. Unable to poke thru my leather belt .. even got my husband to do it, no luck, it slips .. you're better off getting a nail and hammer."
3,Decent,"Not sure if this deserves 3/4 stars. I bought this product just to punch holes in a few leather belts that I have and I must say it does the job. The precision is not that great but it does the job. The tool is quite sturdy and although I have only used it once, it looks like it will last a long time. Overall I would say it is a decent product to punch holes in your leather belts.Oh yeah and it has some safety locks and the product does not come with instructions. One lock for the rolling head which you will need to unscrew, pretty straightforward and the second for the legs which I couldn't figure how to release so I just pulled the legs apart and it left a scratch mark on the tool but it works anyways!"
1,Blunt,"This thing is so blunt, it doesn't cut a hole in a thin piece of leather. And there is no way to sharpen this. It is a great work-out tool tho. I spent half an hour cutting one (!) hole, I was sweating and the next day my arm muscles were sore. At least I got that out of it (and the hole... finally)."
3,Mildly amusing.,A mildly amusing story but nothing special. Not even in the same leagu as Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.
4,Not bad,"I bought this after seeing Hanin in Chicago. She has a lot of energy and is fun to watch.About 5 out of the 15 songs are complete crap, but the others make up for it. She should have just left them out.Just skip over them and you've got a decent album."
4,Her best yet!,"This is Hanin's best album to date! It's much better than the No games, no fun album.Tweakerray (producer of the album for the most part) did an amazing job!This is worth checking out if you're into hardcore electronic beats that are not afraid of sounding sexy from time to time.Go for it!"
4,Natural Factors Acidophilus,"I have been on antibiotics and will be for en extended period of time, in order to maintain a balance ofintestional bacteria without getting an overgrowth of yeast I chose Natural Balance probiotic.The product has worked exceedingly well for me witout the bloating I have had with other brands.I will be using this product for whatever length of time is neccessary as long as I am on Antibiotics."
2,Shuts off during use!!,"I am not sure what genius thought of it, but Sunbeam agreed to let ""him"" develop an iron that shuts off after 30 minutes even if you are ironing! what kind of safety feature is THAT?! I can understand a shut-off feature if the iron senses inactivity but let me get the darned job done first. After ironing for a while the iron starts dragging; you realize it has shut off so you unplug then plug it back in. The sudden blast of internal heat causes it to burst steam and then it leaks all over your article of clothing. Now THAT seems to be a safety issue Sunbeam should address. Save your money. Good luck finding the right iron. Women who iron need to attend Sunbeam's R&D meetings!!!"
2,Avoid this product.,"I bought this this model iron a few years ago. In addition to all the problems previously noted, after a couple of years the markings on the dial *completely* rub off so you can't even see the temperature setting! Silk? Linen? Who knows!?"
2,Sunbeam Iron,"I agree with the other reviewer. I was always ironing and the iron would shut off. Apparently it doesn't matter if your moving iron or not, it shuts off after 30 minutes. Also, as I'm ironing it seems to intermittently leak water on my clothing (not overfilled). Steam is also very random on it's dispersal. I would not recommend this item. Spend a little more on a better iron."
4,The best place to start on 70's funk,"Considered to be at the top of their game here (both in music and designing record covers - although I like the ""Angel"" cover better), ""Honey"" may be the best introduction to this band. It's their most varied album from their best era - the mid-70's. Of course you heard ""Love Rollercoaster,"" but ""Sweet Sticky Thing"" for me is the standout track here, I could listen to the ""Sweet! Sweet sticky thing"" refrain forever, and the sax playing on this track is flowin', flowin', flowin'. ""Alone"" is the perfect album closer - rock this one on the headphones."
2,Backyard Soccer,"The sellers description of the game leads you believe that it will work on the newer computers. The words used were ""works or windows 2000/me/xp 32 bit or higher"". If you have windows 7 with a 64 bit, it does not work. False advertisement."
2,Cute potty & would be great if it just wasn't so small...,"This potty is really cute and the handlebars and rolling ball offer a distraction for a child who needs to sit there and (hopefully) go potty. Unfortunately, my son (who is 22 months) is unable to use it because it is so small. He is a little big for his age, but this seat seems to be made for a child who is very petite. When he sits on it, his knees go all the way up to the handlebars and bump on them. (it looks as if an adult is sitting on a tricycle) Plus, the actual part the child is supposed to go to the bathroom in is not very deep and so tiny that I think if my son was able to fit on the seat and go in it, once he went it would fill up the seat and wind up getting all over his rear! So, while this is a cute potty I would not recommend it unless your child is extremely petite."
2,not comfy to sit on,"It's cute and cheap... but it's hard plastic and just not comfortable for a first time potty user. I think doubling it up into this whole ""fun"" toy thing is distracting for the child and they might not really understand what they are meant to do... (when they're young, obviously for an older child - who should be on the small side - they might get it.) So, if I would be able to go back in time... I would spend more $$ and buy something with a padded seat and nothing that forces the legs apart so the child can decide how to sit and what is comfortable. (I have a girl though, so I don't have to worry about ""the guard"" in the front.)"
1,Right box..Wrong bag..twice,"Camp chef made a boo-boo here. I ordered this carry bag for my Sport grill box bb-60L. The item description outside the box is accurate but the bag itself is about 3 inches shorter of what it's supposed to be. Initially, I thought it was an isolated error.. but when I received my replacement bag...It's still smaller than it's suppose to be. I'm returning my second bag and will be going to a local store to pick up a storage bag for my bb-60L."
4,This camp chef loves the Camp Chef,I bought this grill box to go with the camp chef stove that I have and it is fantastic. I love the integration of the grill box to the existing stove. We use this for camping as well as occasionally for back yard parties to supplement our back yard grill and BBQ. I learned of it from a buddy of mine while we were on a river trip. It functioned flawlessly and cooked our porter house steaks to perfection.
5,"Milet Mini Picture Dictionary, English-Arabic","Wow, thanks for finding this book. I was quite impressed that it was shipped from the UK. The book is ideal. It was in mint shape and the service was very good. I will find great use for it. Thank you again."
5,wonderful,"This singer has an absolutely wonderful voice, and interprets each song in her own unique style. I particularly love Sabor A Mi and Aquellos Ojos Verdes / Green Eyes"
5,Recommended book for all PTA students,A study group of four individuals from my PTA school used A Guide to Success to help us prepare for the state board exam. We found both the academic review and sample questions to be extremely relevant to the actual examination. I would recommend the book to any PTA student preparing for this examination.
4,Upcoming Talent,"I bought this cd back in March in the States on the day of it's release and I'm so glad I did. He's a good singer and the songs on here are great. Not all are great, but the majority. I think it's still only early stages for Frankie J even though this isn't his first cd, but it's going to take some time to come into his own. Sure there are a couple of Usher-esque type sounding songs, but overall, this is a job well done."
5,This CD is a MUST! Especially for R&B fans.,"I am so glad I went out and bought the first CD Frankie J put out. I didn't really know of him but I absolutely loved and related to ""Don't Wanna Try"" and now with his new CD... So glad he didn't disappoint his fans. I can honestly say I can put this CD in and not skip any songs. Great Job!!! My only gripe is that he should've put ""Supa Love"" on this CD. A lot of people don't even know about that song and it is the most amazing song I've ever heard. They really should've thought of putting that song on this album, instead of three versions of Obsession. Like many Frankie J fans, I am a ballad queen, love slow songs. But the upbeat songs on this album are hot and so modern. I am very happy with this purchase. And the fact that he's a fellow Latino, is just gravy. So proud."
3,Could of done better.,"Frankie J has a real nice voice. I've been a fan since I heard ""Don't Wanna Try"", but I think his first album was better that this one. The beats and songs are nice, I just felt his first album was good."
2,leave those high notes to my grrrl christina,"i never heard such stupit squealing from a boy. it's like he a woman or sutphing. i do like that suga suga song though, i won't deny that. how you get so fly"
2,PICK A LANGUAGE!,"frankie j can definetely sing his songs in spanish but he messed up on this cd, he should stick to ""ya no es igual"" and ""despues"" community cause he won't make it singing ""obsession"" forever"
3,Not the worst CD I heard but could've been better,"Wow this CD got trashed by other reviewers. Well I will try not to trash it so much. I enjoyed a few tracks, mostly the slow jams. The up beat tempos were my least favorite. They just did not ""catch"" my ears. I definitely believe it could have been better but nevertheless I do enjoy listening to his smooth voice."
3,"The One That Was Just ""OK"".......","I own his debut CD which was pretty good. Heard ""Obsession"" and knew I was going to buy this right off. It is mediocre at best. Some fine slow jams with a mix of more upbeat club songs. The best song on here, besides ""Obsession"", is: ""On The Floor"" - I love the George Michael sample...nicely done.What just blows me away is the fact that ""Don't Wanna Try"" and ""Suga Suga"" are both included on here as well. They are both SO old! I did not understand the concept behind that. But, oh well. It's a decent CD but I must admit that I expected more."
4,"A good c.d., but it could have been better","When I bought this c.d. I wasn't really lookin' to find a better song than Obsession(no es amor),but after listening to it for a while, I came to find this c.d has a lot to offer. I love the track "" without you"" The way he sings lets you know he really misses this girl he's singin' about. I thought he should have focused on more mid-tempo songs because of his tenor voice.Some of the songs aren't really his style. Like the track ""Get on the floor"" I think he's tryin' to be too mainstream by doin' these tracks. And one of the tracks sounds like a ""Burn"" rip-off! The writers should have tried to stay original w/ his material so he can break out on his own and not have critics compare him to other r&b; singers. But for the most part, this is a good c.d.But why does he have all those bonus tracks that are his old hits? This tottally stumped me!"
2,'The One' CD You Should Skip At All Costs,"Amazon.com's editorial described Frankie J's album as suitable for ""long, late, and lonely nights."" I don't think so. Anyone with any real taste in music knows that on a ""long, late, and lonely night"" you listen to some Sade or Al Green! Anyway, I couldn't get into this album because it's totally boring. I'll tell you one thing: Frankie J is definetly obsessed with Jon Secada and Usher especially. Sorry, Frankie J! But combining the singing styles of two different artists doesn't make you original! ""How To Deal"" sounds way to much like Usher's ""Let It Burn!"" I mean, golly!"
4,Highly under-rated!,"This is really a gem.Not having had a vast awareness of latin music, this would be the album to create great interest. It's his smooth vocal delivery alongside well produced music that has to be the best aspect of this album. He know's how to say it in a way that isn't superficially pop-rnb generated.In an age where real talent is hard to find, Frankie J is one to watch. Don't bother comparing him to Usher or other RnB artists because Frankie J has an individuality within his music style that I think will see him as a stand out artist in the near future. He has found his own way of melding sincere meaning into his songs and in music today, that's hard to find.I must say, i was pleasantly impressed. This album is truly a diamond in the rough."
1,Weak,"Frankie J might be a decent Hook Artist but as a Solo Artist I ain't feeling the Cat at all.vocally he is almost straining&Coming across very generic.""Suga Suga"" with Bash was catchy.""Obsession"" is decent but alot of the material here feels like someone trying to do something that they aren't fully comfortable with doing.there isn't alot of depth to His voice or the songwriting,production."
5,It's Too Factual for Fiction,"Despite being an historical ""novel"" the research and inference suggest far more fact than assumption. The book flows and the story is compelling. Bradshaw has done an excellent job of engaging the reader and keeping the story alive. It is hard to put down once you atart. Whether a history buff or not it is a fine addition to the collection of books about Ney. Reading the research Bradshaw has done in support of the underlying theme one is driven to the conclusion that it is not only plausible that Ney was executed in France but died in the Carolinas, but probably true. One can only wonder what the French will say to this."
2,Pirate Corsair,"My son received this as part of a set for Christmas this year. He will be 5 in Feb. He played gently with it but it still began falling apart. He liked it but was quickly annoyed by the falling sails. He doesn't even bother with it now.Of course, his set came with other parts, but it took us over an hour to assemble just the boat. The only part of the boat that was already assembled was the shell of it. We had to put on everything else.I'm sure there are other products out there that are easier to assemble and easier to play with. This shouldn't be played with. It needs to sit on a shelf to collect dust."
4,Good Nu Wave soul Micki Free shines thoroughout,"I like this album very much great guitar by Micki Free, Hewett is now at the forefront more and is the face of the group at that time ""Dancing in the Sheets"" is a very good 80's type song even though it has not aged very well but the rest of this album rocks great guitar synth on 'Dont Get Stopped In Beverly Hills the songs are tight and Delisa Davis shines on ""Whenever You Need Me"" pop/soul a lovely ballad.With me being a fan of Nu Wave music,this is a good Nu Wave R&B record with rock guitar crunch that sets it's apart. Every black act at that time (trying to keep up with that genius from minnepolis) had one or two songs on their albums that sounded Nu Wavish, it is a very good effort it is not the black pop greatness of ""friends"" but good nevertheless."
2,Average,The Music on this set hasn't aged well.only Howard Heweitt Remains from the Original Shalamar.Don't Get Stopped in Beverly Hills was from the Movie Beverly Hills Cop.The Song Like alot of Songs at the time was a Take off from Michael Jackson's Beat it.The Programed Drum beat&Guitar Solo in the middle.that's the Overall problem with this Album Too Much Formula from a Group that always had their own Idenity.Only Heweitt's Vocals save it.
3,"Conceptually interesting yet, book leaves me unfulfilled","I had high expectation for this book and I must admit that I found the concept behind it quite intriguing. I had seen several images from this book published in numerous photographic magazines and had hoped the entire book was as strong as the images I had seen published. Unfortunately, the balance of the images were not as strong as the few I had seen published. Conceptually strong, photographically not as strong as I might have hoped for."
3,Pales by Comparison,"I've been listening to many Irish albums right now and this one has too much of the same tone throughout. I am not sorry I bought it but with the exception of ""Whiskey In the Jar/I'll Tell Me Ma"" by Barnback, ""Galway Shawl"" by Barnback and ""Fields of Athenry"" by Pete St. John the album didn't excite me. However, this is my first review and I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from buying this album because everyone's tastes differ. Give it a try, listen to the songs."
4,A Bag of Marbles,"Book was recommend by a friend. I thought the book was interesting, especially since it was a true story. Will recommend this book to others."
