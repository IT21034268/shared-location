3,OK for light use!,"Short battery life, had one 18v battery just break from the vibration, you can buy a crummy recip-saw from Harbor Freight for $40.00 that will be much more satisfactory."
1,Battery life stinks,"I've had this tool for about 5 years now, with only occasional use. The batteries don't hold a charge for any appreciable length of time, so unless I think to slap one on the charger a couple of hours before I'm going to use the tool, I end up having to use a hand saw. The charger burned out the second time I used it, so I had to replace it. Bottom line: Chinese batteries are trash, buy something with a Lithium battery and skip the Skil products."
1,Way under powered. Poor representation of U.S. built tools.,"I needed a reciprocating saw to cut up some rotted wood from a fence I had taken down and am replacing. I didn't want to buy another tool I wouldn't use that often, so I borrowed a friend's Skil 18 volt saw. I put both batteries on the charger, and let it take a full charge. Went out to cut up ROTTED 2x4s, and the saw simply choked about a quarter way through. I currently own several U.S. built Skil tools, including a circular saw, sander, etc... I cannot say if this particular saw is indicative of the quality of all of this model. But this particular saw is a serious dud."
4,Like new for Sunday,Came within a week of order. Neatly packed. Wear it every sunday. It still looks brand new! Wish there was an authentic verse replica. But I'm not complaining!
5,Happy Day Tropical Sno is HAPPY with this smiley face purchase.,"Happy Day Tropical Sno is HAPPY with this smiley face purchase.Easily located and most economical price found on the inter-net.I now have a known, reputable, go-to source for my replacement purchases throughout the season.Have a ""Happy Day""."
4,"Good, not great","I guess they're right when they say you get what you pay for. This hookah is relatively cheaply made, as in all the pieces are minimallyglued together with the hose mouth pieces being the prime example. Everything did however arrive new and unbroken. Once set up (a relatively easy set up for first timers) it did create an air-tight seal (optimal in a hookah). I will edit once I actually use it."
4,Great hookah for the price,We bought this for my friend's boyfriend's birthday. He loved it and it was a hit at the party. It worked extremely well and came in perfect condition. My only complaint is that the colors vary slightly from the picture and the hoses are kind of cheap.
3,Its ok,"OK so I ordered this based on price and need a inexpensive hookah for travelin to parties and events. I have several others hookahs, some more expensive some cheaper. so im basing it on my knowledge of other hookahs. If this is your first choice is not bad you could do worse. if your just looking for a travel hookah is decent. There are better products out there for home use. But if your restricted by room this is a good choice. Otherwise it is all around averagePros -Price, Size and case, the coloring is nice.Cons - The hoses are cheap ( were quickly abandoned for better hoses)."
4,Great hookah for the price!,"I don't see the point in having to pay $100+ for a fancy hookah, because this one works great! Easy to assemble, then just fill the bottom half with ice cubes and ice, put some foil paper with your favorite shisha and you're ready to go. Hits very well. The supplied hoses aren't very long though"
2,mediocre,The hookah was what I paid for. The fittings did not fit well. I will probably need to replace it sooner than wanted.
2,Not that original,"I found this not terribly helpful. The career and networking suggestions were nothing new that any other promote-yourself at work book doesn't also tell you.The very real difficulties many introverts have with ""energy drain"" when they're around people weren't discussed much either. Not worth the money, borrow it from a library if you must."
2,Missing some meat,"Yes, this book is an easy read with a lot of helpful suggestions but its really missing something that ties it all together. The sections are short and missing the ""so what"" and don't have a great deal of analysis. I prefer to know all the w's, not just the what, but especially the why. As I was reading I would get to the end of a chapter and think ""that's it?"" and then continue to read hoping to come up with something more than a drawn out ""to do"" list."
5,A real surprise,"I read ""Confessions..."" because of my long term friendship with the author, not really expecting it to be applicable to my life. I was surprised to learn that my discomfort with crowds isn't that unusual. I went on to learn some tips that help me deal with all people I work with every day. Thanks to Meghan for helping an old man understand his lifelong introverted tendencies. Read the book, even if you arn't a shy girl."
4,Great tips for complete introverts and those of us struggling with networking skills,"Many good tips and information. My husband and I both enjoyed the book, and her insights and suggestions. It's an easy read."
5,Helpful to all,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Confessions of an Introvert by Meg Wier. Although I'm not shy or introverted I felt the suggestions were helpful to everyone. This is just one small example, but arriving at a party early and acting as a host or hostess. That's a fabulous tip. Parties can be uncomfortable for almost anyone.Her networking suggestions are also helpful and implementing a few can make a difference. It's a quick read so I would recommend spending an evening reading Meg's book."
5,Great personal perspective and really useful tips,"I am in the center of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, but lean towards introvert. So there was much I could relate to in this book. Meg does a great job of mixing her own personal experiences to her message. She is very open in sharing her own successes and failures. Since I know Meg personally, I felt she was just as real in this book as she is in every-day life. There is a genuineness that makes this a particularly drawing piece of work. She also does a great job of providing practical tactics to being more effective in a business setting. The book is written from the view of a true introvert, but people across the spectrum of personalities will find value in her insights and recommendations. I got the most out of the networking sections. She speaks to the mindset and approach, but also the strategies, tactics and methods to developing a great network. This is an easy read with great content, and I highly recommend it."
5,A classic in the field,"Density functional theory has been used in solid state physics for many decades. It has recently become popular in quantum chemistry. The authors have made seminal contributions to the field and their insight is distilled into this book. The focus of this book is on understanding the physics and chemistry underlying density functional theory - it does not concern itself with computatioonal details of the methodology or specific applications to different systems. Parr and Yang's book has now become a classic in the field, a must-buy for any student or researcher of density functional theory in chemistry."
2,The most over-rated classic,"I've never met anyone who was ""into"" DFT and did not like this book... except me. I think it is the most over-rated book on ab initio theory out there. I liked Szabo and Ostlund and Helgaker et al's books because they were detailed enough that you could not know Hartree-Fock or MP2, but after reading them, you could write a HF or MP2 program. I didn't know DFT before I read this book and I still couldn't write a DFT program after reading it. To me, the text seemed more philisophical than applicable, but considering the limited scope of this book, you would expect it to be more detailed than what it really is."
4,Awesome kit for Home Projects,"I bought an old house that I'm remodeling and started from scratch with nil for power tools. Picked up this kit for the value. I've re done a kitchen and now deep into the second project. Working with 100 yr old timbers and other challenges and these tools have perfomed great. No issues with the drill chucks and the circular saw is a great little trim saw. As with most things now the casings on these tools is plastic. Every one in my seven tool kit has been dropped and dropped on several times, and I can tell you they are tough enough. This may not be a kit for a profesional contractor or commercial application, but for most of us average Joe's out there doing home projects, I would highly recommend."
5,Terrific C.D.,"One of my favorite songs on this C.D. is ""Diamond Girl""! :)Rick Cua's songs are really encouraging. He has faster rock tunes as well as some slower ballads. He's one of my favorite musicians."
4,Great music,"I ordered this CD to replace my cassette tape from many decades ago. This album is good, but I prefer his earlier works, such as ""Can't Stand Too Tall"". As his career progressed, his music became more mellow and mainstream."
3,"Good quality, but a little inconvenient","I like the quality of the tool considering low price. However, its my third multitool and I find that the fact that you have to open the tool before you are able to access the different tools a bit inconvenient. Also the release lever to unlock the blades from the open position, is a little difficult to use. My previous tool was a victorinox, which I lost and I can't afford to get a new one right now. I guess I got spoiled by that one (the victorinox swiss tool)."
2,Faulty Leatherman!,"This Leatherman arrived in fine shape, but curiously, it was not as promised! It has two identical sides, so I have two sets of knives, saws, and screwdrivers, and no scissors or can opener. Clearly this is a faulty item. I am sure it is otherwise fine, but not what I was hoping for."
5,It's everything I want it to be!,"I researched for a good multi tool that would support me when I am at locations requiring me to service PC's (laptops, servers, desktops) and found the Blast! I ordered it feeling if it didn't perform the way I would like, I could probably use it in other tasks. WOW! It has met and exceeded all of my expectations. I received the Blast with a nylon holder (which I would recommend for anyone). I have only had this for about a month but have extensively used it for all kinds of things. I even opened a Smithfield Ham bag today with the pliers (the ham had a metal staple wrapped around the bag)...Whenever I need a tool, I am confident the Blast has it. I now can't imagine going anywhere without this amazing tool. If you don't have a multi tool and are looking for your first one, look no further!"
2,Bummed.,"I was really excited to get my Leatherman. But on the first job, the small standard screw head got chipped. I assume it's rare from leatherman, but I'm still peeved."
3,Plastic in handle broke right out of package,Well made minus the bits of plastic in the handle for whatever reason. This plastic broke right out of package. Would not buy again.
5,Very well done,"An excellent book for it's format, which is aimed at younger readers. It is full of the relevant information on Bix and very well written. The reader will come away with a good picture of the too short life of this brilliant young man."
3,Plus and Minus,"I bought this watch for the vibration alarm. I have it set for every hour. This was the main reason I ordered it, and for this it works great. I had a different vibration watch before and it was bulkier. Though this one is no beauty either, it looks nicer than the others I've seen.However, like other reviewers mentioned, the time is difficult to see. The seconds are in large numbers while the time is in small. Wish that were reversed. I can see the time; it's just more difficult. But as I said the main reason for purchase was for a silent alarm and I'm very pleased with that."
2,Vibration function is about all you get,This watch face is hard to read in normal lighting situations and the light button doesn't improve that much. I bought it seeking a watch with a discreet hourly vibration reminder and it is good for that. Just don't expect to catch the time with a passing glance.
3,makes a bold statement,"This watch is quite large on an average size wrist. I bought it for the workplace where an audible watch alarm would be inappropriate. Love the vibration alarm feature. Very difficult to see the time except at certain angles & lighting situations. More than 50% of the time, unable to see the time with a glance because of the low contrast. Since the buttons are not marked and the numbers are hard to see, using the timers and stopwatch is a chore. So functionally, not the best, however, I don't mind how it looks. Would have been really annoyed if I had paid more. Hoping Casio will make more muliti-functional vibration alarm watches for women."
3,Reading is the Key,"Like Casio very much, first off, I have many Casio watches. Love the color, the intriguing oblong shape loved the overall appearance, I really expected to love it when I got it.Big problem - at least for me! Unless you're out in the sun, and hold it just at the right angle, YOU CAN'T READ IT! Kind of a small handicap in a watch, wouldn't you say?It has all the great Casio features, so I just assumed it would be great, and no one could be more disappointed than me. First time with Casio, too. Wow!I regretfully cannot recommend this lovely watch - not if you plan on reading what time it is."
3,Undecided,I'm not sure if I should buy this set - The drill is a little under-powered (300in/lbs torque)for an 18v model. Most 18's put out around 400in/lbs. Does anyone know the circ. saw arbor diameter? It is extremely hard to find tech. info. on this set. Even the official Skil website has nothing on it. I finally hunted down a picture of this set (at Lowes website) and was disappointed to see that the circ. saw has a right side blade.
3,ok for the price,I bought this kit 2 1/2 years ago when I needed to some home repairs to sell our house. The circular saw was not very powerful and would drain the battery very quickly. Then after about 3 months worth of use I had a very hard time detaching the battery from the saw. So once I finally got the battery to detach the circular saw has sat on the shelf ever since. The drill worked great for about 2 years but now seems that the clutch is slipping so replacing the drill. I still have jigsaw and flashlight and they are working fine. Battery does stick occassionaly on the jigsaw. I guess that I got my moneys worth out of it just hoped that it would last longer than 2 years before 2 of the pieces were broke. The drill is stull useable but have to stop every so often to reset the speed selector because it slips out of gear.
4,Nice bag for your laptop,"I bought this for a laptop that I don't own yet. You can store all kinds of small electronic gadgets in here. It's well made, it looks nice and will do the job. Your laptop could survive damage with this case for sure! I believe what I really need is one of those slim neoprene laptop sleeves for just around the house for everyday protection. Still all around nice."
4,Die Set,Arrived on time and in good condition. Was exactly what I ordered. Would have given it 5 stars but it was a little more pricy than at other gun shops. Needed to use a gift card. Too bad I couldn't use a gift card and get the best price.
1,I just didnt like it,I didn't really like this book. I'm 13 and I think it was not the best book. I love to read too and it is not as good as the other books I have read. Its about this girl named Charlie who likes this guy but then he goes out with her best friend and then he kisses Charlie when her friend is not there. And Charlie kisses him back. So I'm just saying I did not like this book.
3,Pretty good book,"I think it's a cute little story for high school students to read, especially if they are just beginning to be interested in the opposite sex. They could probably learn a lot from it."
2,if you want an ok read...,"Charlotte is a 14 year old freshman who has never kissed a guy. One random day, she ends up kissing Kevin Lazarus, her least favorite guy. That kiss plunges her into a world of uncertainty. Suddenly, Charlie is totally in love with Kevin, but he is acting as if nothing happened. Then he asks her best friend Tess out, and Charlie finds out that her mom is dating Kevin's dad! Unsure of what to do, Charlie gets a boyfriend of her own, but ignores him for Kevin. Both Kevin and Charlie are furious with their parents, but they still have to go on vacation together. Then Kevin and Charlie kiss again. Will Tess find out? Who does Kevin want to be with? Can Charlie find a happy ending in all the craziness?"
3,build up to disappointment,"i'm 20 years old (it's my 14 year old sister's) and i absolutely loved it until the last chapter. sorry but i'm gonna ruin it. how the heck could she pick george. it's such a disappointment. she threw away everything and doesn't even end up with kevin! i understand that it realted to her mother's relationship between joe and her dad, but still. she should have stayed with kevin!"
1,just use a wet paper towel,this product is no better than a wet paper towel. save your money and buy some cue cleaner and a wet paper towel.
3,Porper shaft polisher,"Well made and priced reasonably. It was not what I happened to be looking for, although that's my shortcoming, NOT the product. I was looking for something silicone imbedded to leave a slick finish on the shaft. This product does clean the bluing well enough, however.. The suede finish is top notch. Good size for your case pouch or pocket."
4,Nice jacket,"Tumalo 365 jacket is warm and works well on the slopes. I would give a five stars if the jacket had an extra pocket. Also, the shipping is on time."
3,"Well written, a bit thin on actual work","This book is ideal for the reader who enjoys the traditional format of architectural history. It contains background information, interesting stories behind some of I. M. Pei's most famous works, and a nice biographical sketch of the architect. Arguably, it is also one of the more ""comprehensive"" monogram that features Pei's architecture.Although the photographs are beautiful, this book lacks depth if you are planning to study Pei's work. The plans are too small and are only mere fragments of the buildings. Photographs are artistically taken and fail to give a sense of the entire spatial composition of Pei's intricate design. None of the buildings are examined critically.All in all, if you are looking for an entertaining reading then this book is ideal for you. But if you are looking into critically understanding Pei's work, then this book is really insufficient."
5,Great book,"I am a software engineer, but I love modern architectures. I.M. Pei is my favorite architect, this book gives me a lot of background information about some of the most important buildings Pei designed (do I still need to list some of them?!). I enjoyed reading the book so much."
5,"An underground recording, literally.","The Deep Listening Band's modus operandi is the sonic exploration of music interacting with space, incorporating space as an instrument, in this case, a 186 foot diameter concrete cylinder known as the Fort Worden Cistern. The recording site offers an unusual acoustic space with pure reverberation but no discernable slap echoes. This acoustic quality allows the listener to mentally ""map"" the sound space in a listener-created reality, with a slow-motion, otherworldly blending of voices and instruments unfolding in a liquid sonic boomerang."
5,I've Seen Them Live Also,"Just wanted to let everyone know that i've seen Mushcup live so many times, i can't even count it...they are totally awesome, and i never miss a show, they are truly one of the best bands i've heard. Cd is awesome, you should check it out."
1,There is no need for this book,"Really, I can't really think of anything this book did. The story is a recap of how Peter and Mary Jane met and grew up, and maybe there is some new stuff there, but nothing worth reading the book for. The rest of the book is another fight with Dr. Octapus. And not a very interesting one either. The art is bland like watered down milk. This book just doesn't push any boundaries in story or art, nothing new comes out of it, and it's a shame trees died so this could live, if ever so briefly."
4,Rather pleasant,"A much needed break from the typical pop rap, east coast, and southern style that dominates the rap market. Simplified music and lyrical style popular in the Bay area with a midwestern flair added. Though Rogue Dog Tech N9ne's recent album was much better, this album is of the best from the indy scene today."
1,Talking Down to Graduates,"Collee graduates for years have managed to find apartments, join gyms, and pay taxes. After reading this, I'm shocked!!This book starts with the assumptions that 1. such tasks are rocket science, and 2. there are one-sized fits all answers for all situations. The latter is more problematic. For example, the taxes chapter was the only one that seemed to be more than a list of common sense guidelines with a few (occassionally) funny jokes thrown in. But because the treatment was so short, the advice was superficial and not so useful. They publish guides for many cities, but as far as I can tell don't have staff there - but the Chicago one I have doesn't have any really useful city-specific information.In short, if you have even an ounce of self-sufficiency, ignore this book and research more in-depth resources on the subject you need to learn about."
5,fun and informative,"The book got to me in a timely manner, so kudos to the broker. It's cute and informative about much more than money."
5,My son liked it!,"I got this book as an early graduation gift for my son, and he actually read the whole thing - said it made him laugh alot. I liked the taxes chapter. ..."
4,Great Drill/Driver,"The tool performs well, good torque when you need it and fast enough on the high speed. I was somewhat surprised that the batteries do not maintain charge. So, I learned to keep one always charging. That works well."
5,Awesome camera-the best camera I've ever had before.,"I have owned so many cameras different models for the past 10 years but I love this Fuji S3000 the most. The zoom works very fast, the focus and colors are very sharp. It looks a little bigger than others but it's very light and the price is affordable. All my pictures are so clear even it's in the dark dancing floor. I have taken so many pictures of my house, car, babies for advertisement and making my website. I do not need to touch up on the pictures because all of them look so unreal. I'm so proud to own this Fuji camera. So it's highly recommended."
4,Great Buy!!,I purchased the camera for my not so camera literate husband to take with him on his cruise. He actually brought back pictures that I can see. This camera was easy to use and takes great pictures.Thanks.
3,Poor Action shots,"Overall I am very happy with this camera for still shots. What really gripes me is that if you want to take an action shot, you snap the picture, but it doesnt take the picture right away.....you miss the shot. There is like a second delay or so. I do not recommend this camera for action shots.I have tried to adjust the shutter speed but it doesnt help.....you still have that delay."
4,Worth the money u spend...,"Advantages :Fuji S3000 looks great.. gives good grip, compared to the other cameras in this cadre...Excellent pic quality.. User friendly manual.. moreover, its compact(it looks a bit bulky in the photograph provided)..Registered some queries on the Fujifilm web-page and they responded the next day itself...Disadvantages :Not much difference in pics taken with aperture setting of f2.4 and f8.2...(difficult to get photos with a bulrred background)No manual focus..Suggestions:Rechargeable batteries and charger, and a higher Mb storage card should be included in the camera kit, even if the price has to be hiked by a few dollars...:)"
1,Worst camera I ever had,I bought this camera about 18 months ago from Amazon. It never give me a clear picture.
1,Service a big Problem,I faced a big service issue with Fujifilm. I bought this camera in March and now I am facing issue with the Flash. The service engineer tells me that the flash tube and coil are damaged. I have moved to New Delhi recently and these guys tells me that it will take them confirm that whether the camera is under warranty or not as the bill from Amazon.com does not contains a serial number of the camera. Even if they find out that camera is under warranty they will just waive off the service charges and not the parts cost. I would recommend anynody to buy sony products as they are of much better quality though a bit expensive.
3,serious problem indoors,"This camera takes great pictures, but has one serious problem: it performs lousy indoors. It has major difficulties focusing in low to medium light conditions, so unless your house is exeptionally well lit, this camera will not focuse on the object. It is useless at the parties, museumes, classrooms, etc. Again, if place is very well lit or you use it outdoors, it performs very well. I exchanged it for Sony P72 which like some others has focuse illumination feature and takes crisp pictures indoors. What a relieve!"
3,Good quality book,"Good quality text book. Bit dry but if it's needed, it gets the information across in a concise and thorough manner."
1,little writer on the prairie,"Bruce Bair's characters rise no higher off the page than the print. Everyone he writes about, including himself, is less than 1/2 dimensional. Bair only manages a rare page or two of interesting writing as he describes some of the more grueling farm tasks, but these few pages are lost in the consistent undercurrent of rancor which evoked in the this reader a sad sense of embarrassment for the author and his unfortunate family.Growing up on a working farm and being expected to work long hard hours at thankless and repetive tasks is typical of many family businesses, especially in that time and place. And the same can be said of growing up under a strap wielding dysfunctional parent in that time and place. But if Bair thinks he should stop what he is doing to write a book about such an untypical life I ask that he at least go a writerly step further by giving us one or two characters with whom we can identify or care for."
4,The Polish perspective on Enigma,"This book tells the story of the Polish breaking of the German Enigma code before WWII and thru the early part of the war. The famous English Enigma work was based on the earlier work performed by 3 Polish mathematicians. This book tells how the Polish broke the code using mathematics (not a captured machine as is commonly thought) and details the methods used to decrypt messages when settings were changed. There is a lot of (Polish) patriotic pride in this book which occasionally gets in the way of the content, but it is an excellent book nonetheless. It includes an appendix in which the mathematician who originally broke Enigma explains exactly how he did it which is especially interesting."
1,Too late for Christmas,This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. We ordered on 12-9-05 and it still is not shipped. I will not buy things from this seller again! Loser
1,Put to sleep,My wife and I are both avid history lovers. This movie put us both to sleep in no time at all. Not worth $1.95.
5,Buy this,"I had NO idea who this band was until i heard the song ""bombs away"" on the Blade: Trinity soundtrack, so i bought this album, it is amazing, buy it now"
3,Helpful,This book was clearly written and to the point. It was very useful in helping to write a paper for a graduate course on the subject of working with library boards. It is over twenty-years-old but I found that the subject matter is still pretty applicable.
2,Horrible direction shifter,The switch to change the direction of the drill is flaky to say the least. It barely works. I intend to replace this drill soon.
5,I thorughly enjoyed the mystery and suspense of the book.,A Lost to Love was very interesting and I couldn't put it down. The evolving of the characters and how Diedre became know in such a short time helped keep me reading. Diedre and Robert were kind of slow in figuring out who the rapist was. In all I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
4,Lost to Love!,"Yes, Anderson did not disappoint me with this one. ""Lost to Love"" was great. It was a very enjoyable book to read!"
4,I was intrigued,"I found this book very interesting. I was intrigued and could not put the book down. I could figure out that Bill had something to do with the mystery, but could not figure out why. I had to keep reading until it all came together. Very interesting book."
2,Frustrating,"I bought this for my 3 year thinking it looked like fun for him. It is, but it only works on 1 of our 3 DVD players. Our other two dvd players are on the list of players it should be compatible with. We tried and tried and then called Fisher Price. They walked us through the set up and it still didn't work. They couldn't figure out why so they sent us a new controller free of charge. The new one works on two of our dvd players. The Fisher Price people admitted that it wouldn't work for our Bose player, even though there is a code in the book for it. So apparently even though there may be a code in the book for your dvd player, it is not guaranteed to work."
2,Educational but not compatable,"I bought this for my daughter, and she really liked it and enjoyed it, while she got to play it. Unfortunately the DVD player that we set this up on was older and it broke. We purchased a new one and we have a total of four DVD players in our home all different brands and none of them are now compatable with this system. I lost the set up instructions so I called Fisher Price to get new ones and they never sent them, but someone on the phone was going to help me. When it wouldn't work on any of the DVD players in my home they suggested I buy a new DVD player that was compatable, but we already own four and how many different brands do I need to go through till one works. They should include a list of compatable DVD players on their packaging, since there are so few, so people know before buying, because now this just sits at home with three extra cartridges and it doesn't work."
3,"Read also ""The Emperor's Lady"" by F.W. Kenyon","My fascination with the Empress Josephine began with ""The Emperor's Lady"" by F.W. Kenyon. It was published in 1952. Mrs. DeLorme's book sounds like a good complement to this book, with its indepth commentary on Josephine's impact on art, fashion, and her insights into Josephine as a contributing partner to Napoleon's career. If you like historical fiction, you will also enjoy ""The Emperor's Lady""."
2,Trite,"I loved Schlink's ""The Reader"" and that is why I ordered ""Flights of Love."" It is hard to believe it was penned by the same author. ""The Reader"" is a deeply layered book and one, I must confess, I probably do not fully understand being neither German nor Jewish. Yet, there is meaning that goes well beyond the obvious story line; it is angst and the burden of history.I do not know the time frame that Schlink wrote these short stories but ""Flights of Love"" is more college level writing than professional. The stories are trite to say the least. There are only a few all to brief glimpses of the Schlink of ""The Reader.""Something is always lost in translation of a foreign tongue, a different culture. I thought perhaps the translator was being overly simplistic with his approach - transcribing words and not meaning. Yet, the biography of the translator indicates he is highly respected and experienced. The onus reverts to Schlink. Sorry, I had hoped for more."
4,Love isnt'easy,"Love is not easy: not only attaining it, winning the heart of your loved one, but, most difficult and most important, keeping it. Too many, once they ""won"" the love of somebody, take love for granted, as an acquired boon. They're wrong. This book explains why.This book is all about the self-centeredness, the pettyness, the fear of loving that prevents love to take flight. But it's a recommended reading if one wants to avoid errors. Beware young lovers, where ever you are! Love is a many splendored thing...handle whit care!"
4,Stackable chip trays,The are the same type of trays used in most casinos. They were a little expensive but sometimes you get what you pay for. I only wish now that I had purchased the acrylic carrier when I got the trays.
2,Acrylic Poker Chip Trays,Standard clay chips were larger than the trays and 100 chips could not fit into each tray as advertized. This was a Christmas Gift and was a dissapointment for the giver and the receiver.
1,Precious Essence An Inspirational Adventure,"I ordered this movie because of the review by Herbert L. Calhoun and also because it was an Oprah Winfry production. It sounded like a good moveie by Mr.Calhoun's review. When I received this movie it turned out to be about flowers. Here's a little review: Kendra's adventure includes a visit to her hometown of Salvador, in Bahia, Brazil, where she witnesses a ritual using fragrant plants to invoke the gods and goddesses of ancient Africa. This movie sucks!!!"
1,OOOPS.... wasted my $ on this one,"Starts off like might be pretty sexy. Yet, only about 15% of the movie involves anything remotely sexy. In fact, the first real scene doesn't happen until about thirty minutes in.The sexiest scene in the movie involves the two main characters entering a hotel room where the woman (Jennifer Burton) has tied up a beautiful blonde (Jennifer Behr). Without introductions, talks the man into pleasuring her. Well... it could've been sexy, had the director not cut back and forth like a jack-rabbit sitting on a shot for no longer than three or four seconds.Well... if there isn't a lot of sex and the scenes aren't all that sexy, then you better have a well written story. Uh... It isn't. Picture quality is terrible and the writing is deplorable."
4,Worth Time and Money,"It's the first time I watch a softcore movie with acceptable plot of story. Jennifer Burton might be at her best performance while filming this movie; very fascinating and attractive. In overall, this movie is worth your money and your Friday night. Rating four star just because the picture of VHS Tape is much better than the DVD. No wonder the price of VHS Tape is much higher than of DVD."
2,Way too much summary,"While the story of how ""Andele"" was captured and grew up experiencing the unfamiliar Indian life is interesting and somewhat intriguing, the way it is told has too much summary. There is very little dialouge in the chapters so you really do not feel for any of the characters in the story or anything that happens to them. While it is mostly Andele's story, the book sidetracks to talk about other people's lives, so it distracts from the main storyline. It is a quick read which is nice, but is not a typical novel. I can only recommend it to the younger crowd, since it reads like a fictional storytelling."
4,Rachel becomes a cat in The Visitor,"Rachel ends up getting more morphs than any of the other animorphs, and finding a secret place of human-controller principal of her schools. I think that this is a good book"
3,Not as good as the first.,"I am sorry to say this, but I did not enjoy this 2nd book in the Animorphs series as much as I enjoyed the 1st one. The Visitor seemed to move more slowly than The Invasion. For example (on Kindle) at 24%, Rachel conceives the idea of morphing into Fluffer (a cat that belongs to Mr. Chapman's daughter), but it takes to 35% before they catch Fluffer. Nothing very exciting happens between 24% and 35%; in fact, nothing very exciting happens up to 24%. In this 2nd book, Applegate seems to save the action for the climax-which is indeed exciting. I am going to read Books 3 and 4, to give the series another chance. Meanwhile, if you are a big Animorphs fan, you'll want to read The Visitor for background information. It did have its fun and interesting spots. Otherwise, you might consider reading a plot summary."
3,what is it like to be a cat?,"This book is one of a series about kids saving the worldfrom alien slugs that take over people's bodiesthrough their ears.The group of young teenagers have been given the abilityto morph into different animals once they acquire their DNA.I kind of like these books,but they are pretty light on science."
3,"""The Visitor""","'The Visitor"" is the second book in the animorph series. It is about 5 kids: Rachel, Casey, Marco, Jake, and Tobias. They call themselves the animorphs. The can morph (change) into anything they want when they concentrate.In the book an evil alien Yeerk slug takes over the body of the kid's vice-principal, Mr. chapman. Mr. Chapman has a cat named Fluffer and Rachel morphs into a cat that looks just like Fluffer to spy on him. Chapman figures out that it isn't his real cat! Then a big fight starts between the evil aliens and the animorphs. To find out who wins the fight, read ""The Visitor"".I thought the book was okay. I liked that when they morphed into animals they told how it felt so you can kind of imagine yours being that animal. I thought some parts were a little confusing though. I think that if the author put some pictures in the book it would have made it easier to understand."
5,AWESOME!!,"When Rachel notices that her best friend Melissa Chapmanis acting a little strange, she and the ANIMORPHS leap intoaction. They've already figured out that her dad's acontroller, but now the question is, is Melissa one of""them"" too?"
1,it STUNK,"I thought it was the worst animorphs book and i've read #1 thru 21. it had absolutely NO plot i would definetely NOT recommend this book. But, that is just my opinion"
1,"boring, dry, boring, drab, boring boring boring etc...","I read the first book and it was great. I decided to get the seccond book because I liked the first one and boy was I dissapointed. I had to drag myself through it. I hated it. Don't read this book!!!!!! it was bad! If you read the first one and want to read more don't, after a wile they all get the same. I am tired of the seriese and I have only read 4. THat is all."
3,Too much work,"There are quite a few good ideas in this cookbook, but there are also some duds. As a mom and a daycare provider, I've found that many of the recipes have not been received well by kids, and many have been a downright pain to make. The lasagna recipe turns out runny and tasteless, and a recipe for chocolate pie turned a dessert that could have been made in 10 minutes with instant pudding into a long stove-top ordeal I will never repeat. Overall, I think it was overpriced and prettier than it was useful."
5,Beautiful and fun,I have this cookbook and have used it for the past 5 years. I adore it and all the recipes are tasty. I have had to tinker with a few but overall they are great tasting and very kid freindly recipes. My kids love the peanut noodles under the lunch section. I highly recommend this cookbook. I purchased several for gifts and they are always well recieved.
4,I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK!,"I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK! A CO-WORKER BROUGHT A COPY IN AFTER I MENTIONED THAT I WANTED TO FIND SOME RECEIPIES USING VEGATABLES IN ""HIDDEN"" FORM FOR MY 2 1/2 YEAR OLD. ONCE I SAW HER COPY, I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON.COM! IT'S IN BINDER FORM SO IT LAYS FLAT- A DEFINATE PLUS! IT IS VERY COLORFUL WITH LOTS OF PICTURES AND EYE CATCHING GRAPHICS! MANY GREAT IDEAS USING SIMPLE, EVERY DAY FOODS. NO NEED TO RUN TO THE GOURMET STORE SEARCHING HIGH AND LOW FOR AN EXOTIC SPICE, CUT OF MEAT, OR FRUIT/VEGATABLE. A GREAT COOKBOOK FOR BUSY FAMILIES...I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO MOTIVATED TO COOK AND EXPERIMENT!"
5,family fun cookbook,"my aunt purchased one for my daughter, but i loved the recipes so much i had to have my own.... daughter didn't want to share :).... product as advertised! product arrived quickly and in great condition! thanks!"
5,Great for the whole family,"This is not only a favorite Children's cookbook in my house but I love using it too. Great photos, great recipes and great instructions. We have used this book many times. During the summer months my kids will pick out a recipe to cook and this is one of there favorite books to go to. I involve them not only in selecting the recipe but shopping for the list of ingredients and cooking it.The chocolate dipped pretzels with sprinkles are supper easy to do and make great gifts during the holidays. I have a special needs child and this was a recipe she could do and feel good about."
3,"Wonderful pictures, but not always practical","I love the concept of this cookbook, but in use it has not been as practical as I had hoped. I have found a few good recipes in here, especially the peanut butter and jelly muffins, but on the whole the dishes just aren't something that my kids would eat - or my husband for that matter. The dishes are complicated and often not as kid friendly as they claim to be. Maybe some kids readily eat broccoli and asparagus, but not any kids I know."
2,The muscians enthusiasm needs to match their compositions,"This is a buyer beware and listen to samples of the CD first. It may not be what you are looking for. I enjoy Indian slide guitar and listened to the other reviews posted here, but I should have insisted on hearing samples of this one. It is really just a ""jam"" session and not all that inspiring. I can use it for a 'coaster' I guess."
2,Thank God this is Out Of Print,"What crap is this? Releasing albums like this is what started Michael Bolton's carrerr. This was just painful to listen to. I remember Kane from Alice Cooper and from his first solo cd back in 89. This had one hit on it, so I guess you can call Kane Roberts ""A One Hit Wonder."" He disappeard from the music realm after this and I would to after releasing this album. Bitting of the saw blade on the back cover that makes no sense to me cause this is nothing like a roaring blade. This was very painful to listen to. I can describe it for you as if I was listening to birds churpping outside my window when the sun first comes up. I don't know which one is worse."
3,"Not as good as I thought, but still decent...","After reading the other reviews, I went ahead and bought this CD...I am definitely a fan of 80s/early 90s rock n' roll, and also a fan of the Kane Roberts-era Alice Cooper. So. This album is ok, but I definitely don't get into it as much as the other people who've reviewed it. The stand-out track is, easily, ""Fighter,"" and if the whole album rocked like that one, I'd never stop listening to it. But since most of the songs fall onto the more mediocre side of the fence...I don't know. Like I said, it's not a bad record, but there are plenty of other treasures from the same period in rock n' roll that are much better."
2,Shuts Down,Although the snapshots aren't great the videos came out pretty well. That is until it started shutting down after some seconds of recording. The camera is now usless to me uneless I can find someone to repair it.
4,really 4.5 stars,"great piece of technology. i would give it a 5, but the 3.2mp camera has some flaws with blurring. other than that, i am extremely happy with this camcorder. get a decent video editor, like roxio, and you will be in business for family videos or the crazies on the commuter train.i love this thing!"
2,Very portable but with flaws,"I regret buying this camera. The good: It's very portable and easy to transfer files from the camera to the PC. The bad: The build quality is poor (There are defective CCD pixels that show up as white spots), Noise (If the ambient sound is quiet a constant clicking is heard on the soundtrack, When the zoom is used the motor noise is very load on the soundtrack), image resolution (at 640x480 the quality is much worse than what is available on other cameras.In short, If you're going to take movies that you want to keep and savour, buy a better camcorder."
4,Great Little Camera,"This is a great little camera. I wish this had come out 2 or three years ago, when I bought the first miniDV camera that came out.I am currently in Kuwait. I brought my miniDV Video Camera with me to record my time here, but the dust contamination is so bad here, it is destroying my camera. I started looking for a video camera with no moving parts. Thank God for this Fisher. No moving parts, USB connection, 3.2 Mpixels resolution. Best thing, no rewind. It took forever to get to the front of the tape to see what the video looked like.There are just a few bad points to this model. The cover to the memory card slot is fragile, so a lot of care needs to be taken to keep from breaking it off when opening the compartment. The view finder/screen is a bit small, so it is hard to see unless you hold the camera closer to your face.Granted, a miniDV can record more info, but you just can't beat this little guy for versatility."
4,Good selection,Celso Garrido-Lecca is the best Peruvian composer. Aurelio Tello is a younger Peruvian musician living in Mexico. He is good as composer as well as musicologist. Javier Álvarez is a very interesting Mexican composer living since many years in the United Kingdom. And Roberto Sierra is a Puertorrican who merits to be better known. The Cuarteto Latinoamericano has an excelent level.
4,Very easy and yummy!,"I have try this book and I really like it. It have step by step instructions and even pictures. If you like dim sum, then this book is for you. Try it, you might like it."
3,Unlike all the previous reviews,"I'd like to mention that most of the reviewers come from America or European countries, thus it is truly unfair to judge whether the book is as good as they think it is. Personally, being chinese myself and having gone to Hong kong many times for the dim sum there, I don't really think much of the chinese food in the china town in New york. So when I first read that particular review I had a shock of my life. (With no insult meant to the reviewer of course) The dim sum in this book unlike what previous reviewers have said is not really that great after all"
1,Silly transfer of historical performance,"If you want a recording of this historical recording of Landowska's Goldberg Variations, you may want to shell out about three bucks more and get the new transfer on EMI. In fact, that is just about the only option, for the transfer on this disc is simply silly. The sound quality is awful--worse than EMI's first transfer onto CD. And the way they cut the tracks--the Aria leads straight into the first variation, for only a few bars, however. Then this ""first track"" ends with a pause, and the second track starts with the first variation--starting all over again. Not very careful, were they?"
2,Disappointment,"First of all, it's scandalous that this album is split in two parts -- the total time on ""Convivendo 1+2"" is well within what could fit onto 1 CD.That said, this is definitely the weaker of the two. The melodies are bland pop, the arrangements are heavy on electronic keyboards on virtually all tracks. There aren't any soaring anthems here, unlike his vastly superior best-of album, ""Tra le mie canzoni"". If you feel you must have this album, don't pay full price for it."
4,Very versatile,I really like this tool! Easy to use and can handle most of the small tasks that I need at home.
4,Excellent Value,"Well-balanced, long charge, decent torque. Articulation decent for maneuvering. Bit change simple and fast. Minor issue that only hex shaft bits are accommodated but good compromise for rapid changeovers. Surprisingly long charge for size of unit. Used primarily as power driver for light assembly. At the sale price bought two."
4,Good screwdriver.,Good functional screwdriver. Gets the job done for most routine chores around the house.
2,More Chinese made junk,"After using for a few months, using the slow speed, the clutch slips on all settings. To stop the clutch from slipping, you have to go to the ""drill"" setting at a higher speed. This makes it hard to put in screws with stripping the heads."
3,disappointment,"HelloI use this drill basic home improvement and I like it that way. I wish to give 5 stars but my next experience brake down to 3 stars this product.I bought this item very long time ago, and the rechargeable battery is drained. I try to find a replacement, and I did it... but the joke is: the battery+ shipping is almost same cost if I buy a brand new even upgraded version of this b&d; product."
4,Versatile tool,"Although a bit large, this screwdriver is capable of a multitude of tasks. It has good torque, and with the right attachments, it also works well as a nut driver or a light duty drill. It does come with one drill bit, along with a flat head and phillips head bits. The ability to adjust the angle of the head and the small light are pluses. Mine didn't have the built-in tape measure as advertised, but I don't think it would be very useful anyway."
4,Works great for driving screws,"The Black and Decker PD600 is a very good general purpose battery power screwdriver. It shows pretty good control of rotational speed with the trigger, and enough power to drive most screws (with pre-drilled holes). The size is about right, and the pivot head comes in handy. The easy change chuck makes taking the screw driver bits in and out very quick and easy. The torque setting ring, in the front of the unit, can be hard to turn, and it does not seem to make much difference where it is set for most screws. The battery has enough capacity to do a moderate amount of work, but the lack of removable and replaceable battery case makes it dubious for a full days of work without stopping for a re-charge. It comes with only one very small drill bit that fits its unique chuck. It does not seem very useful to use as a power drill. If you are pre-drilling and then screwing, it would be best to have another more powerful electric drill to accompany this electric screwdriver."
5,great Hand Held Drill,"As usual Black and Decker makes a good, powerful, low cost drill.I like the new features of holding bits. I like the longer handle."
4,Black & Decker PD600 Pivot Screwdriver,"The B&D PD600 Pivot screwdriver is also a good drill. Cordless is very handy working on my fiber travel-trailer away away from 110 voltage. Typically, most of my work needs both a screwdriver and a pilot drill, so this tool handles both."
4,Versatile tool for small house projects/repairs/maintenance,"This is my second unit, I had my first for 5 years then the charger stop charging and the bits change mechanism broke. It was a useful good unit while working so I ordered a new one .The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 star is the long term reliability.I like the easy to change bits mechanism, the build in carry-on for the main 2 bits, 2 speeds, high for drilling and low for screwdriver bits. The built-in LED light in the head helps in darker/shadow places. This is a fairly powerful unit. Use folded like a drill or strait as a screwdriver. It has a clutch to help prevent stripping. Overall a real nice unit. When charged it has enough power to finish most jobs without re-charging."
4,Wow,The only problem I have with this drill is that it held a charge sooo long I lost the rechargeable cord.
4,Electric Screwdriver,"Pros: Just about everything one would want in an electric screwdriver.Cons: I bought this item as a gift for an 85 yr. old and he found the instructions very small to read. Then I got a call saying the instructions talked about a tape measure in the handle but we couldn't find it. We just about took the screwdriver apart in our search. There seems to be a spot it should be but just never got installed. Maybe this was the reason it was on sale. The drill bit seemed to be added as an after thought and almost got thrown out with the packaging.Overall it does the job it was meant to do, with plenty of power and ease of use."
3,Good while works,"I like the tool, BUT battery design is really bad. My older version, which had removable battery (VersaPak), fell and broke. I had that thing for about 8 years. When first battery died I just bought replacements and had 1 extra in case you need one for a bigger job. It's a shame B&D doesn't make it anymore. In my opinion it's unacceptable to buy a new screwdriver just because battery is dead."
1,Bad News Drill/Driver,I bought this driver/drill to get into tight spots.When it arrived I did not realize it has no chuck therefore I had to buy seperate!The discription was vauge as to the lack of a chuck. So I was disappointed in thismachine from the start. I purchased the chuck seperate.This tool has poor power to do the jobs necessary around the house.There is no backup battery and the hole for the charger is in the joint of thepiviot so when you get it you cant fnd the hole to charge it.How stupid of an Idea is that.Dont make the mistake I made. It lasted two screws and the clutch broke.. Ireturned it for full credit..
2,Dead within two years of hardly any use,"This drill did perform satisfactorily light household tasks a few times it was used. I had used this very sparingly, about 4 times in 2 years. Recently when I took it out of the toolbox it didnt turn on and attempts to recharge it didnt work either. It is dead."
1,Poor Quality - Breaks Quickly,"I liked this screwdriver at first. But I've had it for a few months, used it a handful of times, and now I see how much it sucks.1) Battery doesn't keep a charge. And you HAVE to use the battery. You can't run it directly off of the plug in.2) Poor quality. It's really terrible -- I pulled this out of my drawer today and it only works in reverse. For real -- reverse! No indication of damage or anything -- it just stopped working.Black & Decker -- improve the quality next time."
3,Cool one of a kind screw driver with a few flaws short of perfect,Very neat screwdriver with the right idea but needs some work. Weight is a bit heavy and can only be locked into like three positions. Should have more lockable position like 5 or 6 in my opinion as the 3 lockable positions are so close that the angle is almost the same. Doesn't even lock in a 45 degree. Should lock at that and more positions. The light feature comes in handy. Alone thing is it is a very dim orange amber color light. Should of made it a brighter whiter light or use two bulbs instead of just one. I like the two built in screw bit holders at the top which is very handy. The quick release system and the screw driver and drill switch is handy and useful as well. All in all a very good device with some needed improvement. For the $20 bucks I paid you can't find a better deal at that price at any store.
3,Excellent product but the battery seems to be a problem,"I'm buying my 5th of these today. The history is this: I bought one for myself. It was so awesome that I bought two more for gifts for friends. In less than 90 days, my battery died. I took it back to the retailer I had purchased it from and got a replacement. That was 18 months ago. The battery on that one just died and so I'm buying another. For the record, both of my friends' batteries are still fine.The 50% failure rate for me is pretty frustrating, but the product is so excellent (and cheap) that I'm willing to overlook it and buy another one. And for those who note that the tape measure no longer comes with it - it was a cheap tape measure and you're not missing much."
5,"Useful, but beware of the bits","This is a light, sturdy tool with useful add-ons like a level and tape measure. However, be aware that this tool uses Quick Connect bits that are different than standard drill bits. These bits have a hex shank that lock in in lieu of using a standard chuck. These bits are fairly easy to find online and in stores, but don't expect to use your ordinary bits with this tool"
2,Only for simple jobs.,"I've had this screwdriver for over a year, but I only use it for the most basic jobs. My main issue is that the drill itself is so long that the pivoting doesn't really allow you the ability to work in tight spaces. It isn't versatile. I have a cordless drill that is more compact. The battery life is good, and its got enough power for what I use it for -- nothing heavy duty. It is easy to use, and the quick release is handy."
2,LACKS DURABILITY,While the 6 volts of power are very welcome I would have preferred a more durable product. My PD600 is almost one year old and it will no longer hold a charge. I used the power screwdriver for about an hour or two about four days a week. It worked great until three days ago when it ran out of muscle. The battery! For the money I want the tool to last more than a year. My back-up is a VERY old Skil power screwdriver which has never let me down in over 10 years. The Skil lacks torque but is almost perfect.
2,You cannot replace the battery!!!,"This worked on a very light work load--maybe every few months on a small DIY project. After less than two years, it will not hold a charge and is totally useless. We get what we pay for, folks, and Black & Decker apparently knows a lot about making cheap tools."
2,died to quick,"I dont like rating items until I have truley tested them. This screwdriver has served me well. The ONLY concern is that the battery died and I cant replace it, as I have to now buy another electric screwdrive i will think twice about buying a B&D; one.Sorry but thats how it is."
4,Great Tool for the Money,"I bought this tool three weeks ago and have been very happy with it. It has sufficient power even for light-duty drilling (1/8"" pilot holes for screws in wood) and does a fine job of installing and removing screws. The adjustable clutch is very useful for preventing destruction of a screw head. The built-in worklight is a terrific bonus. The unit is comfortable to grip, although I sometimes miss where the trigger button is on the first try. My only beef is that the accessory bit-holding slots do not do a good job of gripping the hex-shank bits I put in there, and they often fall out. Aside from that, a terrific tool at a great price."
2,Not as advertise,"The package I got has the correct model number and description; but the actual product does not have the 'On-Board Tape Measure'. As for the cordless screwdriver itself, it is okay for the price. In hindsight, I should have look for one with a level and removable battery."
2,Disposable,"OK, so I have had this for about 7 years now.It easily outlived its warranty and performed well enough.I haven't used it very much, but as I don't do a ton of DIYthis was my drill and screwdriver, sounds nice right?it was good enough for my purposes, besides being a little underpowered for some jobs.The last time I took it out, though, there was no charge on it. Fine, it had been sitting a while, but now it wont hold a charge. At all.Whats worse, can't change the battery, it's NOT replaceable.so for about 4$ a year, that's not too bad; Still, I hate to throw this thing into a landfill, but what choice do I have?SO~ now I need to either buy another one to throw away later, or throw away all the specialized drill bits I had to buy for this thing. I don't like my choices here. Why not make the battery replaceable?"
3,A bit disappointed - but my fault,"OK, so I don't know the difference between a drill and a screwdriver. Seems to me they do the same thing, but whatever. I got this for my husband, who needed something that 'drilled' too...He likes the screwdriver, but it wasn't what he'd expected. So anyway - disappointment for him (and me), but my fault. I'm sure this is a fine screwdriver - just a sucky drill. ;)"
5,A powerful and useful tool,I always wanted a battery-operated screwdriver and a drill- this one has both features. It can easily switch between the two functions so you get the right power for the specific job you are doing. It has a built-in light which came in handy when I dropped a screw and had trouble finding it. I look for things to fix now- that's how much I enjoy this tool.
2,Save your Money,"This item has a limited life span. Similar to other reviewers, you have to finish any screws yourself and the clutch burns up with any real use. Works to locate studs with small pin holes. Other than that, save your money."
3,ING. MANUEL NAHR,"BUENA POTENCIA Y DURACIÓN DE LA BATERÍA. EL PROBLEMA ES QUE ES MUY POCO PRACTICO PARA TRABAJAR CON EQUIPOS PEQUEÑOS. NO ES FÁCIL DE LLEVAR YA QUE TIENE MUCHO VOLUMEN, SI GIRARÁ 90 O SE PLEGARA 120 SERÍA EXCELENTE."
3,Good while it lasted,"Great battery life (between charges, could go a long time without being charged, and had lots of juice when it was needed), but this is now dead, it won't take a charge, and it's only about 2 years old. It did some great stuff while it worked. I was never happy with the bit storage: the bits are hard to secure in the holders, and fall out easily. the Philips head bit seemed to be the wrong size (too small) for a lot of things; I wish there had been a couple sizes of them."
5,Great little screwdriver,"Purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife and have been installing blinds ever since. While it's not intended to take the place of an 18 volt drill, it does a great job screwing and unscrewing. The forward, reverse rocker switch is more convient than others that we have used and the angles are handy. I would not recommend it as a replacement for the DeWalt heavy duty cordless screwdriver (my favorite), but it's lighter and 1/3 the price. Well worth the money...."
4,Great All Around Screwdriver,"It does everything as advertised.Pros: different torque settings, 2 drive speeds, small LED light, pivot point, overall ""feel"".Cons: drilling is only for light duty jobs (otherwise get a real drill), charging time takes too long. connection for the charger plug is right in the pivot point and it doesn't let you use it while plugged in.Other than the charging issues(that's why I won't give it 5 stars) but it's a great tool at a decent price."
4,Well designed screwdriver/drill.,"I am happy with his product. The design is a little strange for a screwdriver, but easy to get used to it. As a drill it does light jobs effectively."
1,Pivot is useless,It doesn't pivot 90 degrees and the length of the shaft is as long as a standard drill. This means that you can't use it in tight places. Better to get theBlack and Decker XD1200K 12-Volt Ni-Cad 1/4-Inch Hex Cordless 5-Position Drill/Driver Kitwhich has more power and works in tight spaces.
2,Somethin's Wrong,"Unit is a handy thing to have but I think I got a defective unit. The main thing that is wrong is that the Torque is very, very low and the the adjustment to ""increase the Torque"" simply does not work. Simply put....the unit can start a screw into the wood but can't even come close to finishing the job. Somethin's Wrong.Captain Don"
3,"Loved the item, hated the sudden death","I've had plenty of other electric screwdrivers like this, but none that had the power or long-battery that this has. In most cases I've not had to turn to my heavier 19.2v drill/driver because this did the trick. But suddenly in the middle of a job when I pulled the trigger - nothing. It was suddenly dead. I've had it about 1 1/2 years. The light still came on, so the battery was fully charged but the motor wouldn't turn. After numerous attempts to solve the problem I gave up and picked up the drill/driver to finish the job. I've since bought a cheaper Skil screwdriver, but it doesn't have near the power."
1,Major Disappointment,"I have had this for a few months and it has basically stopped working. It will run, but there is no torque. Also there is no ability to LOCK the driver. I.E. when there is not enough power, you often want to finish it by hand...but not possible as there is no lock.I was surprised by this because I have had many B and D products and almost all have performed very well but I would avoid this product."
1,Returned It,After reading the glowing reviews here I was anxious to buy this item.Well after a 9 hour charge it was still weak and easily stalled. My screwdriver did not come with a tape measurer so maybe they've replaced this worthless model with the one in which the reviews were previously written.I'm going to buy another item with a 'cord' and it won't be manufactured by Black and Decker. Buyer be ware.
3,Great drill! Though not much power.,"This is too long and large to be a screwdriver, its more a low voltage drill. Works great as long as that is what you need."
2,inoperable equipment,The 6 volt battery charger did not work at all so I decided to buy a new one. I checked many stores and they didn't have the part and it was less expensive to replace charger than to ship it back to you for another
5,awesome,"Just what I wanted. Works great, has lots of power and perfect for a woman with arthritic hands to operate with ease. Thank you black and decker for making a cordless screwdriver/ drill that is powerful yet easy for a woman to operate."
3,Light Switch Problem,I got this tool and started to charge it and noticed that the light was staying on and if I touched the light switch lightly with my finger it would turn on and off so I returned it and ended up buying a more expensive Bosch driver that works great. The other problem is that you never know when the drill is fully charged because there isn't a light on the charger or the tool plus they don't provide a carrying case or bag.
1,Junk,"Used this literally four times. Last time when reassembling a wooden bed frame, the screwdriver won't tighten down screws....just spins with a rat-tat-tat. Might have well just flushed my money down the toilet. Pay attention to the other one star reviews....mine is not the only one whose clutch went out. Did hold a charge though."
5,cordless screwdriver,This is a great light weight tool that is easy for women to use. and for that matter anyone. I really like this screwdriver.
3,Convenient Measuring Tape - GONE...,I was surprised to see that B&D went away with the measuring tape usually stored in the handle. All the accompanying documentation still mention it.
4,Just right for average home use,This handy cordless screwdriver is simple to use and able to get in tight places thanks to articulating head. Easily adjust the angle with one hand.
2,no power drill driver,I couldn't drill a hole in dry wall. Very disappointed! Set me back again. I did charge it for length of time in instructions. Couldn't even hang a paper towel.
4,A very useful tool,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't up to much as a drill, but it was just what I needed in an electric screwdriver and I wasn't looking for another drill. It feels good in the hand, the buttons are intuitive to use, it comes with some decent driver heads, and the LED light is awesome for dark closets. I keep the clutch on a fairly high setting for removing old screws otherwise it gives up rather sooner than I would like, but all in all, a great buy. I give four stars instead of five because the tape measure isn't there (the symbol indicating that there is one is on the handle, but perhaps I bought a model that doesn't have one.)"
5,Auto Dealership,I work at an Auto Dealership as a Sales Consultant and I use this product frequently to remove and replace license plates. It works great and I highly reccomended it. I thought it might not have enough power for rusted on bolts and screws but I rarely every have to flick the switch to drill strength from screw strength to get that little extra torque. Great tool and it gets plenty of use.
3,decent product from Amazon,"Didn't come with the tape measure, which was OK. I was trying to scres into plyboard and I couldn't adjust the torque to handle the drilling, so I ended up manBlack & Decker PD600 Pivot Plus 6-Volt Nicad Cordless Screwdriver with Articulating Headually screwing in the screws. I imagine with a little more experimenting, I will be able to figure it out. All in all, I am satisfied with the product."
2,LED Trouble battery life non existent,"Gave this to my husband for fathers day, June 19, 2011. By all counts it works as described with one major flaw; the LED stays on and drains the battery. So unless he wants to leave the item plugged in with a bright yellow light emitting, it loses its charge long before he gets to use it for projects around the house. We looked all over the B&D website and there was no information regarding the LED which stated he should be able to switch it off. The switch on the bottom doesn't solve the problem. Would like to know how to get a replacement for this item. Packaging and box it came in are both long gone."
4,It's OK,"This tool does what it says it will do. However, the slot for extra bits does not hold them in place well, and they will drop out - especially the drill bit.The instruction manual refers to a tape measure stored within the base of the handle. The handle shows where the push-button for access would be if there was one. There is none in mine, and a review of the accompanying web page does not show or suggest that there might be one.This is truth is advertising I guess, but I'd like to have the tape also."
2,poor build quality,"I like the features of this screwdriver (except the quick-release collet), but the one I got was poorly constructed...it even ""felt"" that way compared to the craftsman 3.6v it was replacing. On the B&D, the task light would turn off intermittently during use, and the speed-selection switch wouldn't always engage properly. I got the craftsman 7.2v instead, and it's great - solid construction, comes with a case and some screwdriver tips, and only a few bucks more."
4,great but where are the bits?,I have looked everywhere for bits to add to the ones that come with the unit. I have been looking for two years and can't find any. So as long as you are happy with the two bits you get it is a sensational product.
1,Battery not being charged after one year,"This cordless screw driver worked for me for a year. I used it scarcely. After one year it stopped working. Looks like the batery is not being charged. There is no option to put a new battery. Now I have to buy another one, and I will buy where the battery can be replaced."
3,very handy for small jobs,This is a good product for small jobs around the house. The one draw back is you need to have bit type drill bits in order to use the drill feature. I found a small set at home depot but I am still searching for a larger set. Overall its a good product for the price.
5,Great Cordless Screwdriver,"I love this screwdriver, particularly the fact that you can adjust it so that it is straight or bent. The only downside is that it does not take standard drill bits, you have to buy the special hex ones. Still, it's a great product and I highly recommend it."
3,"Ok as a screwdriver, I wasn't planning on buying new drill bits","While this is a great screwdriver, I find myself digging through my toolbox for my old drill that uses real bits instead of funky hex based bits.It would have been nice to just take out a bit and get started. The pinhole bit that was included is also useless."
5,Excellant Screwdriver,I fixed all my blinds within minutes... This tool is very flexible to use and found more useful... This can be used to drill and as a Screwdriver.... Great product for this price (around $25 )
1,Item shown is not item shipped,"I attempted to get an accurate shipment on this product twice and sent them both back.The product shown on Amazon's web site does not exist anymore as verified thru Black & Decker's web site. Same product (PD600) but NO TAPE MEASURE.The product that was actually sent was the Model#PD700G as seen on a Big Box retailer's web site (rhymes with Roam Depot).B&D; keeps the PD600 code but gives the new item with no tape measure.I notified Amazon the first time, in detail, that they are shipping the wrong item and gave them the correct product code.Second time, same problem.Outstanding customer service and got full refund both times."
5,Great for Anyone!,"I bought this screwdriver for my husband, but I think that it would be great for ANYONE! Its a great all around household tool. And it has more power than I could have imagined."
3,For Lightweights,"This is good for what I need it for but would recommend a more heavy duty one for your ""handyman."" The power may not be to his liking but for the occasional job it is just fine."
3,"""its too bulky"" and not enough power","This cordless screwdriver is much too large (bulky) to ""not"" have the turning power you'd expect. I'm just a novice ""fixer upper"" but I've used other 6 volt power tools with much more power than this one has. But since I have it now and its works on some things---and it was inexpensive----I won't send it back."
1,Burned Out !!!,"I used it to drive 2"" screws into a couple pre-drilled holes. The reverse function simply malfunctioned within first 5 minutes. The coil was burned with smell. It's a toy, not a tool."
5,A triumph of musical architecture and intensity,"This is one of the true masterpieces of piano literature from the latter half of the 20th century. Some have called ""el pueblo unido..."" the Diabelli-variations of the 20th century. The piece is a caleidoscope of musical styles, ranging from romanticism to minimalism and to percussive mechanical bursts, all these elements follow a compelling emotional and architectural logic. I have heard the recent Hamelin CD and this earlier recording by Stephen Drury. I find Drury's contribution more convincing since there is more music in it. The passion inherent to the theme itself and the musical contrasts of the variations are more effectively portrayed in Drury's version, I think. Hamelin is good as well but the manual execution gets sometimes over the emotional intensity of the music."
5,A great recording,"Of the three performances of this piece that I've heard, this is the best one aside from a live performance that I heard that was absolutely sensational. The piece itself is dinosauric in scope. It's an absolute monster that has an incredible message and requires superhuman technique from the performer. Drury's execution of the piece is quite good and filled with emotion and his technical prowess is very present on this recording. It's also great that this recording offers a version of the theme (""El Pueblo Unido Jamas Sera Vencido"") in more or less it's original setting. The only thing I could have asked from from Drury is to have employed the optional improvisation that Rzewski offers to the performer after the 36 variations that really can take the piece to a new level. While this recording is really great, I would really like to get my hands on a recording with the improvisation at the end."
1,Fright Night by Bela Lugosi,"Fright Night (10 Movies On 3 DVDs)This set is a total waste of time and money.You only get what you pay for. The set is of poor quality,(Sound&Picture;),House on Haunted Hill has very dark picture."
3,it needed work,The arm's are flimsy the electro staff is cheap plastic the robe/cape is a soft rubber and not much movement I didn't like it as much as I thought it would sitting on my shelf
3,Good features but uncomfortable,"In general the drill worked pretty well, considering what you pay for it. It doesn't have tremendous torque, very secure jaws, or a long pull (of the variable speed trigger) compared to an expensive drill, but again is as good or better than what you might expect in this price range. The major problems I had were ergonomic. There is a sharp ridge along the back, with especially sharp corners where the cut-out for the level is; the level is a nice thought but I didn't find it useful. The grip has a single ridge on the front, not sharp but more of a problem since it is difficult to avoid. Finally, the shape of the neck of the grip was totally unlike my hand, quickly causing a sore spot at the base of my thumb. If not for the last issue I would have kept the drill. I strongly recommend people try holding this one before buying it, especially people with smaller hands."
4,A Good Dependable Tool,"The DR201K is a strong and lightweight variable speed drill. It's handle is ergonomically designed to fit the hand while the trigger is designed to be depressed by two fingers making it easy to work with for long periods of time. The speed is easily controlled from its maximum down to a few rpm. When keeping it on at full speed it doesn't overheat even if its on and working against resistance for 5 minutes or more. Let's not overlook the price. At ~$30.00 it's nicely affordable. Bear in mind, it's not cordless. If that's not an impediment to your demands for a drill, I recommend the Black and Decker DR201K for your tool collection."
1,This line says it all,"From the description:""Nitrogen Gas-Injected Low-Loss Dielectric Insulation For Optimum High-Velocity Signal Strength""That's beautiful. I want to work in Monster's marketing department. If you believe that, then you'll be happy to pay $40 for a $2 cable.HDMI is digital, folks. There's either a signal, or there isn't. Don't waste your money on Monster(r) SnakeOil(tm)."
5,A Beautiful Classic,It has been quite a few years since I first heard Carl Stone - and this music really stands the test of time. There is a satisfying variety of music on this album and in addition to being a classic is a great place to start for an introduction to experimental/electronic music.
4,Great performance,"The conducting is very good, The orchestra is excelent and Gheorghiu really shines! Alagna is not the best tenor around, but he is ok. The same aplies to Barcelona. On the other hand, Julian Konstantinov is really very bad for the Requiem... Any one who doesn't own the Karajan version, casting Pavarotti and the extraordinary Ghiaurov,Price and Cossotto, should definitelly buy that one first. But this one is the best second choice around."
3,Excellent but there must be better,"I grew up with the Telarc version by Robert Shaw on CD and this just doesn't quite fit what I was looking for. Hold on to your remote control because the dynamic range is immense if you are trying to hear the soft sections and it builds to a thunderous roar in a few seconds. I just don't think the soloists were mic'd correctly to stand out. Alagna seemed weak in voice, Angela was gorgeous but I agree a little too dramatic and poor Juluan was a fountain of sweat. The most disappointing aspect of the DVD was the subtitles. Granted in masses these composers tend to repeat phrases....but for those of us who do not know Latin repeating the translation would really help in enjoying the mass. It seems at times as if we did not see a subtitle for about 10 minutes."
4,Kahlo Biography DVD,"This is a very comprehensive video biography of Kahlo's life. Her story is told using vintage still photographs and priceless B/W home movie clips. Also included are on camera interviews with those who knew her best; family members and former students, and those who have written books about her; Hayden Herrera, Martha Zamora and Raquel Tibol. If you're looking for an in-depth discussion of her art you won't find it in this documentary...very little is said about her paintings. If you're unfamiliar with Frida Kahlo, this is a good ""Introduction to Frida Kahlo 101"". On a scale of 1-to-10 I would rate this documentary a 6."
2,Fruit Salad presentation,This is the worst of all the biographies of Frida and maybe the worst biography of the series. The start out in the middle of the story and goes back and forth; there is no coherence. Much of this presentation was lifted from an excellent Mexican production {Frida Kahlo - La Cinta que Envuelve una Bomba (The Ribbon That Ties the Bomb) ~ Jesus Muñoz Delgado (DVD - 1992).} They do not really introduce Hayden Herrera.There is a different spin on a few facets of Frida's life which still is worth watching if true or not. However if you are going to miss anything this documentary would be it.Frida Kahlo - La Cinta que Envuelve una Bomba (The Ribbon That Ties the Bomb)
5,Gray love.....,"One of the most interesting books I happen to read with Mary Motley Kalergis' book about interracial couple called Love In Black And White. All the photo are done in black and white, and they feature couples from all across the country. Most of the couples are black/white pairings, but some are white/biracial and black/hispanic. Some who decided to date and marry got blessings from their families, some did not. But they all have one thing in common: they love and respect each other.Furthermore, many of the couples have kids, and their kids are phtographed with them or there's pics opf their kids in the background.If you want to read about family diversity, pick this book up."
5,Wonderful!,"I loved reading this book. So happy I bought it. This is going in my ""never going to sell or give away pile""! The photography is beautiful and the stories inspiring."
1,A disappointing DVD,"We were very disappointed in this DVD. It is only 10 minutes long. The pictures were often too dark and very few of the artifacts were identified. I would not have given it even one star, except that I was prompted to rate the item."
3,"Needs help out of the box, Great once attended to.","You CANNOT use this tent out of the box.The nylon is not rainproof (or even dew proof.) The seams are not sealed.The zippers are not heavy duty... be gentle with them.You MUST DIY with sealers and waterproof sprays. For 3 tubes of seam sealer from Walmart and 3 cans of fabric water proofing spray from a camping store we spent about $40.~~STILL a good deal for the price~~ even with the extra cost, time input and preparation.Fits my Honda Element perfectly, was a wonderful addition to our NY to CO roadtrip and various weekend music festivals where is poured cats & dogs the whole weekend, we stayed dry. You'll have to maintain the water-proofing (as with any tent) every few years."
5,Nice Gift,"Was shopping for a last minute gift and came across this, the reviews I read kind a scared me about all the different colors of gold etc..I bought it anyways and was very pleased when we opened it to see it was exactly as described and a perfect fit!Awesome!"
5,Awesome,I got the ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it. Definitely a great value.
3,Alot smaller,"This ring is alot smaller in person than in pictures, the pictures make it look like the diamonds are decent size and they are very small, I was a little disappointed."
2,14 K two-tone diamond heart ring,"I review this item, i check out the pro's and the con's. I should of listening to the con's more. I'm very dissatisfied with this ring. The only reason I'm keeping it because I hate to order items and return them. The ring is very small. I order two heart shaped rings, and I love the cheaper one better than i liked the 14K two-tone diamond heart ring. I hope no one else order this ring looking for a good deal, because it's not. I gave it a two-star because for the money I paid for the ring, and it fits perfect, I will keep it. For two hundred bucks I was expecting a little more. Sorry about the bad review, but I tell it like it is."
3,Not Completly Satisfied,Not near as large as I thought it was going to be. My wife is wearing it as a pinky ring becouse of the small size.
3,disappointed customer,I was a little disappointed in the sales person. When all I wanted to do is exchange this ring for a smaller size and I couldn't. I had to return it and then buy a smaller size for money which I felt it was unfair.
3,ring,I was disappointed in the ring because the picture of it looks as if the diamonds and hearts were bigger! The pictures on the website should be more realistic!
2,Useless,Some guy's drunken musings on some great quartets. I think he gave op. 133 2 pages. No structural or harmonic analysis. Antiquated and banal.
2,The Admiral,"The film is excellent but the cost of the DVD was $99.00 + postage. For that price, I expected more than one DVD, especially as the film had recently been serialized into 10 parts of about 45 minutes' duration on Russian television. Only one DVD (with scenes cut out) was sent and the sender explained that the high price was due to that particular DVD being out of print. I still think the price is unreasonably high, especially as the one indicated on the package was $3.00. Also, while the sound was consistently good, the picture was sometimes jerky, which would suggest that the DVD could be a pirated version.So, altogether, I am not very happy with this purchase.Annie Kean"
5,THE field guide to bring on a scuba trip,"An amazingly well done flied guide useful for even advanced fish enthusiasts and scuba divers. I have used this book on dive trips to the Egyptian red sea, the sea of Cortez in Mexico and to Cuba, as well as while walking trough several aquariums in the US, and I have hardly ever failed to find a tropical fish species I observed in this book. The illustrations are well done and include juveniles, sex differences and regional color variants. In addition to the geographic range of a species, the likely occurrence on the reef (lagoon, outward reef, sand ...), the depth ranges and information about fish behavior are indicated. I have found this additional information extremely useful, especially when trying to identify one of several similar species.The book is divided into a Indopacific and a Carribean part, and in addition to the species descriptions there is a short general introduction to corral reefs and fish biology."
3,Good for Identification,"This is an excellent field guide for identification purposes. However there is one major way I would like to see this book improved. I would like to see more detailed information about the fish rather than just identification, maybe more facts about ecology and behavior. Even though I have given the book three stars I would say that if you need a book for strictly identification purposes this book covers a numerous amount of fish, and the pictures provided do point out crucial identification characteristics."
2,Disapointment,"I am engaged in a detailed project involving over sixteen hundred video clips taken during a diving career. Many species are not known to me, or I have simply forgotten their names. So, I ordered Coral Reef Fishes. I expected a book showing accurate photographic examples of 2,500 species. What I received was page after page of artists' impressions, many of which I know to be inaccurate. There are also some glaring ommissions of fishes that are not particularly uncommon in the Indian Ocean and a plethura of sketches of fishes I have never seen in many hours underwater. I have many other books on the subject, each using photographic examples. Leiske Myers' book is a huge disapointment.Brian Leeson. France. 9th October 2012."
3,"No photographs, only drawings!","So I was a bit disappointed that this book contains no photographs, but only drawings. The problem being that some of the fishes we saw in Hawai'i and French Polynesia are really hard to find in the book due to different colors in the wild compared to the drawings.Also, the names seems somewhat funny. Take for example the Hawai'ian reef triggerfish (Humuhumu-Nukunuku-Apua'a) which is called wedge picassofish in the book. Maybe that is the correct name, but I have always seen it called reef triggerfish everywhere else.Also, you really have to know your Ocean areas if you want to understand the very compact and cryptically abbreviated range descriptions for each fish."
5,Excellent...full of humanity and scholarship,"When reading a book about psychology, I often find either scientific theories which are fascinating but somewhat abstracted from the immediacy of emotional functioning, or a weak series of short vignettes about others and their dilemmas. This book overcomes both problems. It treats the primary attachment of baby to mother with empathy and humanity, while citing the science and historical development of attachment theory. I felt as though I could relive my own early experiences through the book...it deeply touched both my heart and my intellect. If you want to understand the profound and precious nature of initial attachment, and perhaps gain an insight into yourself as well (not to mention your baby!), get this book."
3,A good book but not for everyone.,"I started reading this book because I wanted to bring my child up to be securly attached to me. I have to admit the book has a lot of very good information, however it is very long and detailed and is very much a psychology read. It is a good book if you like that form of reading. However it was a bit long and complicated for me who just wanted some basic parenting info. If that is what you are looking for than I recomend the book Attachment parenting. That was more of a guide for parents and was very helpful for me."
3,Good movie.....but widescreen?????,"I've really liked this movie since I was a kid. I'll spare you my analysis of it...enough people have done that already in their reviews. My comments are directed to the so-called ""widescreen"" version. This DVD has both full-screen and widescreen.....but they're both the same. The widescreen version is simply the full-screen with black bars superimposed. It is so obvious. The studio is ripping you off. I have found several other DVDs that are like this. Somebody needs to raise a red flag."
3,Sexy beast (from Venus),"There is something endearing about 1950's B&W sci-fi...perhaps they are the visual equivalent of ""comfort food"". ""20 Million Miles To Earth"" is one of those films. Famed FX-meister Ray Harryhausen's creature (hatched from an egg brought to Earth by returning astronauts) is truly one of the creepiest and most affecting ""stop motion"" creations in the genre (with physical similarities that cast more than a little suspicion on the ""creators"" of the monster in the ""Alien"" films). Much standard ""armed forces vs. the creature"" mayhem ensues (and we all know that there's only one crowd-pleasing reason a monster scales a high object toward the end of a sci-fi film...thank you Isaac Newton). The mostly Italian cast provides unintentional chuckles in a ""MST 3K"" fashion, but Harryhausen's magic saves the day. And besides, how many films can you name that feature a WWF-style throwdown between an elephant and a lizard-primate from Venus?"
3,20 million Miles to Earth,"Old style story. Still ok as a pasttime movie. Ya had to be there in a car at the drive-in with your girl, a coke and popcorn."
3,Always Worth Watching,"This film has Ray Harryhausen's usual excellent special effects: an immense rocketship returning from Venus to a disastrous crash into the Mediterranean, and a quite original monster -- although why he was called ""Ymir"" of all things, I know not.It also offers an interesting glimpse at postwar Italy, not long after the restoration of democracy.Moderate in its violence and well-acted, suitable for all ages, I like it a lot."
4,Harryhausen's Best B&W Film,"After the success of ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" and ""Earth vs the Flying Saucers"", Charles Schneer (producer) and Ray Harryhausen (effects) kept the ball rolling with this top notch sci-fi thriller. A Venus probe returns to earth with an alien egg. Once it hatches, the earth's atmosphere causes the alien to grow to gigantic proportions. Harryhausen's last B&W film contains his best effects up to 1957. The creature is believable and scary, especially in the barn sequence. The combination of animated monster and real backgrounds is impressive, especially when you consider when this movie was made.Today teams of men and dozens of computers create effects. Back in 1957, Harryhausen alone created amazingly lifelike creatures. When you see one of his films, you'll want to see them all."
3,Venus Sends Her Love,"If you love Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation monster movies, this one certainly won't disappoint. One of the FX-Meister's all-time best beasties - the ""Ymir,"" as it is dubbed - is the star of the show. Actually, he's pretty much the only star of the show, the rest of the cast being composed of dubbed Italian actors.The Ymir starts his life as an adorable little lizard from Venus, who hatches with kittenish mews from the cutest little egg, and prances playfully around the coffee table. But he has a helluva metabolism. Before long, he's able to move the coffee table and half the living room set around all by himself, and then the living room - and the rest of the house - as well. Culturally deprived, the Ymir never saw King Kong, and fails to realize that tangling with circus elephants in public and climbing coliseums never comes to a good end.All in all, a memorable little special effects goodie."
4,20 Million Miles To Earth,This well performed (even the clay-mation creature )but limited effects 50's horse STILL has the legs to entertain.
2,why only sony?,"My Toshiba SD 2800 player seems to handle all discs without a problem except these columbia-sony brands ( Ive had the frozen camera angle with the three stooges as well) I contacted sony home entertainment and they said they havent heard of any problems!!!!...well maybe they need to read some of the reviews here...well I guess my next question is,In watching 20,000,000 miles to earth this way, will the camera angle icon ""burn in"" if I watch it this way,,?...I hope sony addresses this, and no, the player is only a year old... to bad."
3,Venus Schmenus...this thing is pretty neat even at 50 yrs old.,"Well, while this is another level of brilliance by Ray Harryhausen, it is not one of my favorite movies but I grabbed it because I enjoy watching it from time to time. Basically this movie got the same treatment that IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA got (see my other review) as far as the colorization and features. This time, our feature critter crash lands in the sea off Rome and a boy finds a capsule contain a gel like substance, which turns out to be protection for.......our critter, once hatched, our critter begins to grow rapidly because of earth's air supply and soon becomes large enough to be a real pain in the butt and starts wreaking havoc all over Rome. While entertaining to watch, there are others in the Harryhausen series that are better but that's just a personal opinion. It is definitely good enough to add to your Sci-Fi Library for sure."
4,REIGN OF A REAL MONSTER!,"Since we're being constantly disappointed with Hollywood's monster movies, so-called, of today....check out the classics like this one, stop-motion genius, Ray Harryhausen's, 20 Million Miles to Earth! Boasting a cool alien, the ""Ymir"" with a King-Kong-type complex going on...a unique setting, Italy, and classic B&W photography and you've got a great time on your hands..."
3,Ray Harryhausen made this film,"I have watched this movie many times and always I am amazed at the genius of Ray Harryhausen. The way the little creature from venus rubs his eyes and moves is incredible, but his screams become more unnerving as time passes. Somehow I tend to feel sorry for the alien creature and think to myself, ""welcome to planet earth"". Keep in mind however that without the special effects created by Mr. Harryhausen the movie would be real bad based on the existing screenplay."
3,20 Million Miles To Earth (50th Anniversary Edition),"What can I say, a classic is a classic is a classic if you like old Sci Fi. Great restoration!"
3,What 's whith the little icon on the upper right...?,"I love all monster / alien movies and these classic with stop animation the most as there was so much work involved. The colorization process for this film was very good and i am very glad to have this special edition.And it looks like most people that does'nt have a Sony dvd player will have to endure having a camera icon displayed on your tv screen at a bothersome place...and yes it something that will bug you througout thewhole movie...b/w or Color version. This icon is used to change from one version to another using the 'angle' button on your remote. Was this change fully tested...maybe tested in China...Guaranteed, that i will make sure that future dvd's that i buy donthave this feature."
4,Saterdays At The Movies,"This movie smacks of the 50's era monster movies. The storylines are very thin, but if you're about ten they don'thave to be remarkable. Seeing Ray Harryhausen's creationsis always a treat."
2,Dud cordless drill,My other drill is a 10-year old DeWalt and it's still a better tool than this wimpy Skil. The dud-batteries are probably the main fault of the drill. Not even close to the run time I get with the DeWalt.
4,Great Drill...........Inexpensive,I bought this drill for my husband and he has yet to have any complaints and has used it for several projects since he got it a couple weeks ago.
1,junk,"i just received product, junk. I charged batteries fully, it did not have enough power to install stormdoor. That was using 2 batteries and still could not get the job done. My old stand by dewalt finished the job."
3,"Not That Great, But What There Is","Barclay briefly describes the various sorts of stateless societies that have been studied by anthropologists, and goes on to describe the relevance of this study for those attempting to create a stateless society. The book is rather mediocre, I think, but since there is no other significant treatment of this topic it is an essential item for anyone interested in the subject."
2,good for the kids but incomplete on arival,nice lil cur for my three boys to learn with. plus the compact ability is good since there are a few spots in my garage that require a shorty stick. big problem is the missing tip. had to fix it myself not a big deal but i favor things i buy to be complete.
5,Great Live Album!,It doesn't matter if you haven't listen Biohazard before...This album is awesome! the live sound it makes Biohazard songs faster and just great... If you did ever went to a underground concert you will appreciate this cd.
1,BEWARE!!,"This reissue is shoddy crap produced by ROADRUNNER RECORDS. This, like all their double discs contains no liner notes, no lyrics, just a lame interview. Buy the single disc remaster of Urban Discipline. Paying the extra bucks is worth it for the original packaging. BTW, The art is completely awful on the double CD version."
3,Kinda Creepy,"This book has an adequate technical description of the techniques and is helped if you also get the DVD book(?), Create with the Designers Beaded Crochet, of hers that contains some of the projects from this book where Ann Benson gives a good demo of the basics.I guess some consider the projects tasteful but I think the majority of them are very old fashioned and I am a 66 year old grandmother! My main objection to this book are the photos of young girls dressed up with lots of makeup wearing these 'jewels'. This is where my review title comes in. These pictures are far too reminiscent of that poor child, JonBinet Ramsey, and therefore Kinda Creepy!"
3,old fashioned,"This is so old fashioned! it looks like the jewles of a grandma, that the grandaughter will love to play with, but, well, nothing I really want to make.maybe the instructions are good, that is why i am giving it 3 stars and not one. but the thing on the cover - this is what inside. do not expect anything modern. this is only my opinion."
3,Nothing to it ....,"Our girl never worked properly but my 3 yr. old loves her anyway and carried her w/ her everywhere for awhile. But I agree w/ the previous comment, for a younger child, you have to supervise pouring the bubbles. I will say the doll is adorable and very, very durable b/c we had ours for awhile and she looks as good as she did when we first purchased her. And my Daughter loved her little glasses ...cute. I would recommend."

2,Poor coverage and poor reception for voice,"I love the blackberry for data, but don't count on it for voice calls. Mine drops calls once about every 20 minutes of talk time. Thats totally unacceptable but T-Mobile's response to my report of poor coverage in my neighborhood was ""try driving a mile to the north-east, you'll have better coverage there."" Hmmm. Very convenient.I suspect the coverage issues are partially poor reception on the blackberry."
2,Lousy Support from T-Mobile,"I love working with the Blackberry. However, try a service other than T-Mobile. On a recent trip to Europe, the unit malfunctioned and I was forced to purchase services ordinarily paid for with T-Mobile. Upon my return to the US, the only compensation provided by T-Mobile was a replacement unit. I had to fight with five different support reps to get $15 in express shipping and $20 credit to my account for outage and $35 in minutes. $70 compensation for over $200 expenses and the inconvenience of missed appointments due to phone outage. Proves to me that T-Mobile does not stand behind its service."
4,Love the new Blackberry 7230,"PRO's:I really like this baby! Does almost everything I would need it to do while being away from my home computer. I like that it is color and it's small size. Fairly easy to learn.Con's: No Speakerphone! That would be great! No adjustment for screen contrast, I would like it a little darker text/icons and brighter display but you cannot adjust?? Easier phone controls to make a phone call would also be nice. Really hard to enter a phone number using that keyboard. Overall I am happy with it, if they ever upgrade to include what I mentioned I am there in a heartbeat!"
1,Check T-Mobile coverage at your home/office,"My zip code ""passed"" the zip code test for T-mobile coverage, but when I got the phone there was zero signal at my house. I called them and they looked up my home address and said yes, they show a dead zone in my area. They were very nice about terminating since well within trial period, and then I had to return to Amazon. BUT HEY - they had my home shipping address in order to open the account and ship the phone to me!!!! If T-Mobile has a database that shows specific dead zones, wouldn't it make sense that most people expect their Blackberry to work at home?So, my advice if you know you are in an area that has spotty coverage for some carriers is to call BEFORE you order. I called AT&T to try to verify with them, but they don't have a map that goes below zip level. Maybe that's because they really have full coverage??? I'll know in another week."
1,On par with Palm OS.....from 1997,"Blackberry needs to get their act together. 3rd party apps range from horrible to non-existent. Usability is atrocious. So I can get my corporate e-mail via a wireless device...so what when everything about the so called ""crackberry"" sucks! But I'm sure all of the ""pointy-haired"" bosses out there love this piece of crap."
5,Guitarists Check This Out!,"Though written for piano, guitarists should have a field day with this tome of knowledge. Even with my experience, I wasn't prepared for the wealth of information. Palindromic scales? Scales that read the same, backward or forward. That is a little tease to get you interested. Use some imagination by reading the bass clef as G clef, turning the book upside down, etc., and new worlds open up. You do this with your ""other"" books right? How about non-symmetric interpolation? Doesn't even sound musical. Polyrhythmic scales, pandiatonic progressions. Order the book and open your eyes!"
2,Wayne Shorter spoke for me.........,"Someone said I should check this book, so I bought it. A great jazz musician, Wayne Shorter would speak for my thoughts on this book (p.110, Artist Transcription Hal Leonard 1990, HL00660120):""There's a book by Nicolas Slonimsky. A lot of musicians had those books, but the book is only scattered as a puzzle to be put together the way you want to put together. A lot of people had the book and they tried to put it together into a puzzle they thought it was supposed to be, and ran into a brick wall and the book becomes part of the library. I think harp books serve the purpose or any other book....... ""Is there anyone who can demonstrate ""how to put together Slonimsky puzzle"" on YouTube? I think some materials sound cool.... but it didn't work for me."
4,modernist musical architectures,"This book is a collection of phrases and scales with the purpose to present some raw material for modern/avantgarde composers, or etude material for the musician preparing themselves to play such ouevres. From a contemporary composer's view, it's probably old news. If you are an improvisor, it is quite interesting stuff, because it contains mainly stuff beyond what you might know as scales from jazz theory. On the other hand be warned, there is nothing of ""real"" musical ""meaning"" in it - most of it is just symetrical, mathematically constructed stuff, similar to the diminished scale or whole tone scale. Up to you how to make sense of this material and incorporate in your playing."
2,Incomplete..... Cast off your outdated beliefs,"After reading carefully, I found an overlap (No.20 & No.393) and a missing ""symmetrical"" scale, 1 b3 3 4 b5 6 b7 7 (= Messiaen's M.T.L.4)..... check No.1142-1190 of the pentatonic scales section...... sketchy information.In fact, the ""Master Chords"" section (unnumbered p.244) is even worse...... it's just a series of dominant chords 1-3-b7 in uncommon terms..... Tritone, Diatone (Maj 3rd), Sesquitone (Minor 3rd) apart.Slonimsky's Thesaurus had become anachronism and I found it's very incomplete. The book is old ...... published in 1947...... and soon people will not want to buy it anymore.Replace the outdated Slonimsky's Thesaurus with Dr. Lateef's ""Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns"" and Yamaguchi's ""The Complete Thesaurus of Musical Scales."""
4,Thesaurus Of Scales And Melodic Patterns - Review,"This is a very good book. It basically outlines series of melodic patterns based on clear principles of harmony set forth in the introductory section. These patterns' harmonic uses are fairly clear and seem to be intended to assist performers in developing proficiency playing melodic lines and ideas in defined harmonic contexts. Since the patterns fit a mathematical (for lack of a better term) taxonomy of musical notes, their logic (both intrinsically as well as their applications)is clear.I would think this would be quite helpful for developing muscular facility with these types of musical ideas and a way of thinking about developing melodic lines."
5,have read at Least 6 times with other wyoming stories,love it each time like gretting old friends again as with most Lindsey series i just cant seem to stay away
3,Good for the money,"First things first: If you're a pro, or a serious woodworker looking for a tool to use every day- or even every week- this ain't the one. It doesn't have the muscle to drive 50 screws deep into wood, or to drill steel, or any of a dozen other things you might want a good cordless drill motor for.But that's not what I bought it for. I've got a good Makita 1/2"" cordless, and a couple of corded drills for that. This was for my girlfriend, who needs a drill once in a blue moon, and would like an electric screw driver for regular tasks around the house. And for that kind of use, it's very good indeed.So if you're looking for a convenient drill for light duty use, the B&D; 9.6v is not a bad choice. One hint: The wall wart charger takes a long time to bring the drill up to full charge, so if you're thinking of regular use, get the fast charger and a second battery."
3,Good enough for what I need,"This is not a high-powered cordless tool, but neither is it expensive -- quite cheap, in fact, as power tools go. And it is perfectly sufficient for many little jobs around the house where the ability to drive in a couple of screws or drill a hole or two is required. If you want to do major construction, this is not your tool of choice; but if you every so often need to use a screwdriver or drill and have arthritis in your hands, as do I, this is a dandy and very inexpensive tool."
4,Not a bad drill,"nice med duty drill. Battery charges ON BOARD THE DRILL, which is a bit unusual. Usually a drill comes with a charger-BASE! Overall, good for household use. Bit inserts are all on board the drill so can change from phillips to straight, etc, very easily.Price was right, but would upgtade in a minute.Joline"
4,Just what I needed for my uses.,"Works fine for me, but if you need a more powerful drill a larger model might be better/"
2,"Weak drill, good for light home use","I bought this drill because of the price. Doesn't feel to cheap when you handle it. It is not very powerful or fast. Works fine for light drilling(installing blinds, cabinet hardware...) I wouldn't build a deck with it. Im not sure of the battery life yet as I have not used it extensively."
4,good product,"Bought for a gift, was a little disappointed cause after I bought this I saw better deals everywhere, will shop around first before doing this again. Shipping and delivery were prompt"
1,Crudy of Revenge,Don't believe the other reviews. This book is extremely poorly written and therefor difficult to read. It is repetitious. It is amateurish. It is speculative. Did I mention it is repetitious. Don't buy a new copy. Don't buy an old copy.
4,Stark Revelations,"Laurie Mylroie's amazingly lengthy and detailed research documentary of the real reason for the attempt to kill 250,000 people points squarely to Saddam Hussein. The American justice system, geared to appease Saddam as part of the current Administration's support structure for the status quo, represented in court that Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind, had fled to Afghanistan, when according to his plane ticket, he had gone to a pro-Iraqi haven. This immense book breaks the assumption of ignorance of the American public."
5,Want to know what we knew before sept 11?,"This book lays out step-by-step the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. There is a good attempt to link Al Qeada to Saddam Hussein. This book is prophetic considering it is written prior to Sept. 11 attack on the WTC. Considering many still have not grasped the state sponsorship aspect of terrorism, this book is a must read."
3,Know the Author,"I have not read this book (though I did read an article published by the author that summarized the book). However, I am not writing this review about the book - just about the author.I had this woman as a professor during college. She is far out on the right and is uncompromising in her views. Whether you agree with her thesis or not, know that about her before reading this book (or you'll be surprised)."
2,Foul Mouthed And Not Very Insightful,"I listened to Nanci regularly in Seattle, and generally enjoyed her show. Often she didn't let the facts get in the way of a good story, but that isn't uncommon in radio broadcasting. She was always entertaining.I couldn't wait for her book to come out, but found myself very disappointed at the result. It is riddled with mindless vulgarity and has very little thoughtful insight into the broadcating business and sports. When in doubt, spew a few f words and hope the audience will laugh. I'm sorry, it doesn't work.While railing against the idiocy of the average sportstalk caller, this book instead contributes to the dumbing down of the American sports fan."
1,crap,I am all for skeptism but this dv was an hour of subject bashing and Nick Pope showing his true colors...do not waste your monet unless you want a one-sided biased film with a misleading title!
4,UFO info galore!,"Very comprehensive look at the span of history as it related to UFO's. Informative and clearly researched very well, this film is geared toward the UFO fan but would be entertaining to even those with slight interest. Very well recommended."
2,Not worth $2.99 to view.,"This video is full of too much CGI and too much dance music. Can hardly hear the questions over the music. And the narrator at the starts seems to have a cold. I've heard his voice before. All and all, there are hundreds of UFO and Alien videos out there that are much better. Don't waste the $2.99 to view."
2,Worked great. . . until it broke. . .,"We bought this saw for tree trimming. First time we used it it worked great, sawed right through tree limbs 3"" and smaller, also worked great trimming the fronds off the palm trees. But during the second use an internal part broke and the blade no longer stays in place, making the saw useless. Can't find the receipt, so we are stuck with it. Our next saw will probably not be a Black & Decker."
1,Bad quality,"The tool idea is good, however the power and quality of materials is inferior. Mine is already making an awful noise and ""freezing"". I used it to cut 2x4's during a room's renovation. I'll never buy black & Decker garbage again."
2,I was expecting a lot - NOT One,"In product description states, 12 pounds weight and I am saving over $100. I only received one single unit?Not as stated in advertisement"
2,12 oz denim is bogus,"These jeans are made of 12 oz denim that is not very good. Almost every pair I have bought has needed holes mended after the first washing. Not big holes but they would have gotten much bigger if not mended.It looks as if some kind of acid has dissolved the denim in places? WTF is up with that? Buy the other riggs jeans made from the 14 oz denim, I have never had any problems with them. Other than that they fit good and I love all the pockets."
3,Not that great,"The book is published in England so its difficult to convert in my head from the metric system to the US system.The atlas is separated onto many pages, making it difficult to figure out what goes with what.Overall not a good choice if you need US measurements and if you need a good atlas."
2,not the best book about Barbados,Not the best maps- One large map would of been nice. Information on buses to take to locations inaccurate. Could of had more sights listed to see.
5,Incredible renditions of Cage piano pieces,"Margaret Leng Tan, the pianist on this album, knew and played for John Cage himself for more than a decade. The insight that comes with such a relationship with the composer shines through on this album. I can scarcely imagine better versions of these wonderful piano pieces. The pieces span a variety of types of pianos (prepared piano, toy piano, regular piano, bowed piano) and moods. From the incredibly beautiful (""In a Landscape"" is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard) to the aggressive (""Ophelia"") to the minimalist (""Music for Piano #2), this album spans quite a bit of the possibilities for piano music. I highly recommend it, but should caution you that you must have an open mind to enjoy this--this could be unlike you might have heard a piano played before (or imagined it could be played). If you like this, I recommend ""The Perilous Night/Four Walls,"" which also has Margaret Leng Tan playing piano."
3,accomplish its purpose,It should have some hole in the key to put it in a key chain... I guess I'll lose it soon...
3,the 1st girl 2 scream,I applaud the fact that she filled up the album with lots of tracks - it's like a buffet table & you'll be sure to find a song you will like.
4,its okay,this album is okay i gess its just to diffrent then what im used to but i like it & i respect kelis for being diffrent with her music i rll like trilogy & bossy + there are some songs ui can tell will grow on me it was def. worth the 10 bucks ultimately if i had to redo it i would buy it!
1,"That's right, she WAS here","This album is completely missed only the songs 2,5,6,9,10 are correct, the others you just want to skip them....quickly. 'Like that', with this horrible Castafiore-like singing is just unlistenable.'Kelis was here', is the album title premonitory???"
1,kelis was here and now shes gone.,"kelis's new album ""Kelis was here"" is very poor. the lyric are extremely poor. the songs lack in everything except for the beats. i actually gave away my kelis was here album. the only song i actually liked was bossy. this CD is very poorly done and the lyric sounds like a last minute thing and the beginnings of the songs are too long. Her album cant stand a chance against others. At this time all these artist comes out with all these strong album and hers cant stand a chance against. like the 15 year old multi platinum artist JoJo, even she can do better. Justin Timberlake, Monica, Beyonce, the list goes on. This album is poor and i really dont know why this album is higher than 3 stars"
2,it's ok,"Kelis is One of those Artists that had she came along during the 80's then her style might have caught on even more so than now. alot of the material She has recorded puts me in the mind of heavy 80's synth Pop some had tight moments&others were kind of filler.Kelis is the Kind of Artist that trys some different things musically&there are Artists who wish they had that kind of vibe at putting something left of center out to see what would go down. now vocally that is what really hurts her to me along with about 6-8 too many songs. if you put about 8-10 tracks on a Album with Kelis then you might have something&keep the direction she is going in. nothing on this album is touching ""Milkshake"" from the last time out though ""Bossy""&a Couple other tracks have moments. Kelis is one of those Artists that had she came out of Group or a Band enviroment then she might be on to something."
4,Kelis Was Here,"This album is a step up from ""Tasty""Best tracks:Till the wheels fall offBlindfold MeTrilogyLil Star"
4,SEVERAL CLASSICS ON THIS JOINT,"First, Bossy is my joint. Cuz im a BOSS. ""AW Sh$t"" she can make a whole song talk Sh$t. Ce-Lo (trk #13, ""Im a Star"") is always appreciated on any track compilation, always some introspective type vibe giving inpiration. I love it (not a party song though). But then theres ""WEEKEND"". Im playing that joint on Monday to get me through til Friday. Ya heard!. ""BLINDFOLD ME"", hmmm now that's an idea, pretty sexy song. And the ""CIRCUS"" brings it full circle for me explaining her perception of the 'entertainment industry' and expectations of entertainers. KELIS continues to impress me. Big UPPS, to Kelis."
4,"Wanted More, But this will Do","Kelis is one of my favorite artist. If you are looking for something that you hear on the radio, then for get it. Kelis is different in the best way. I love her first three albums and wanted alot from this album, since she did this album without the neptunes, it proves that she is here to stay. Out of 18 songs I like 16 and I am a die hard kelis fan, Buy this album and the first three, you will be very happy."
1,Who Is She Again?,"Why is she still recording? I didn't buy anything but the 1st single from her first album. Different is nice if you have the talent to back it up. Bossy? can't be that from the bottom. Kelis is cute but that's where it stops. Leave the realness to Mary and the ability to Beyonce. Bossy is annoying and faceless; I couldn't pick her sound out of a lineup blindfolded. She sounds the same way talking in a microphone. It astounds me, that she has made it this far on so little......um..........well.....Sales.I read somewhere about the labels re-structuring and the criteria with albums. They won't release albums if they don't have more than one hit single then they turnaround and give another record deal to someone who hasn't even had two singles released off of the same album. Enough said."
4,I need help too!!,"I see that a lot of people have been asking about the trailer song in the commercials for ""the notebook"" as well. I want that song, and to my dismay, it's not on the soundtrack!! I know I heard it before, I just don't know where! Please help me with name and artist! I absolutely love it! THANKS!!!"
5,Movie Trailer's score? TV Trailer's score,"I love the music in this movie, they are *THE* best!The sad part though, you won't be finding the music used in the theatrical trailer --(...)As many said before, the music used in the TV trailer is ""Nina Gordon - Tonight And The Rest Of My Life"".I wonder if anyone have any luck with the music used in"
2,Not what I thought,"This soundtrackk album is not what I thought it would be like. I don't mind the fact that majority of it is just music no lyrics, but some of the songs drag out for so long and it becomes a bit boring."
3,The Notebook CD,"I am an audiophile and I much prefer very well recorded CDs or SACDs. I liked the soundtrack of this film, so I ordered the CD. CDs of soundtracks seldom even approach the quality of a movie soundtrack that is heard in DVD format, so I wasn't really expecting much in terms of quality recording. And what I was expecting is what I got therefore I am not disappointed. But I do like the music. Hence 3 stars."
4,The song from the Trailer is ....,"Okay okay okay! Here it is everyone!""Nara"" by ES Posthumus... and for all those who know they've heard it before but can't recall ... it was also used in the trailer for ""Unfaithful"" (no, it's not on the soundtrack either)"
4,thank you,"Thanks for replying to my email about the trailer song for the Notebook, I will look for it now!!!"
5,Perfect...,"The album is just right for the movie. It hs the old jams, and aso it has that old Jazz I never get tired of! I love the album, movie, and book! And I ready to but it all! I love it all! I fell in love with it, for me its the best movie of the summer! Its better than the movie that is rated the best this summer!"
4,To Kim:,"Well, I haven't heard the soundtrack yet, I'm thinking of getting it because I just saw the movie and I really enjoyed the music. But I've played that piece before that Allie played on the piano and it's a Chopin Prelude in E minor. Hope that helps."
1,Item Not Received,"I did not receive the item ordered, despite send an e-mail to ""customer services"" and having no reply.Not a happy bunny at all !!!"
5,"Looking for ""Notebook"" sheet music or string arrangements","I'm a cellist for a string quartet. We're already getting requests to play ""Notebook"" selections for weddings. Can anybody help us find sheet music or string arrangements?"
4,Commercial,"On the commericials there is an instrumental piece playing in the background, I believe it has been in a few other movies (Pleasantville comes to mind) and I'd like to know the name of it. It's a beautiful piece."
5,The Main Title,Does anyone know how to get the sheet music for the Main Title. My girlfriend loves this movie and I would love to learn to play it for her. Thanks.
2,Not for finished walls,"Beam is fine. Water bubbles work fine. What it doesn't tell you on the package is that to mount to the wall you have to puncture it. That's OK for roughed-in walls, but not for hanging pictures on finished walls."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED NOR AS PICTURED!,"Item description was, 10ft Male DVI to Male HDMI Conversion cable & picture clearly shows a magnetic distortion safety on the DVI side. I received a 6ft DVI, HDMI, cable & guess what? No distortion safety. Seller blames Amazon, how could be? Does it really make seance? Anyone can make a mistake and send a wrong item but to blame Amazon is totally unprofessional and uncalled for."
3,So So,"After using a Pentel Pocket brush and a Sakura brush pen I was expecting these to be similar. However, the tip is a lot stiffer than those. It feels a lot more like a standard marker than a brush, but with a flexible pointed marker tip. They get the job done for me and I will definitely use them though.As for colors you get three cold and three warm. The cold and warm sort of clash if used together, so I have been mostly using them three to a single piece. The warm ones go good with pencils, the cold ones seem to go good with black pens.One other thing that seemed a bit odd. The warm ones seem to have light, then dark, and slightly darker tones. The cold ones seem to be more light, medium, dark. I like the warmer ones better, but getting an even flow between the three shades seems rather hard.FYI: I am a total and complete amateur hack when it comes to artistic ability, so if your totally awesome artist friend says something different, trust him and not me."
1,Edit your copy,"The golf cart cooler is great. My husband has one and I'm thinking of getting one for our son. I read your ad, though, and was struck by its poor grammar. &quot;Your&quot; should be &quot;You're.&quot; Granted, children in elementary school often make this mistake, but anyone who writes copy for your company should know better."
3,Not so good as advertised,"Picture is superb, but sound leaves a lot of unfilled satisfaction.I live in Guatemala City and bought this model locally, unfortunately what I found is not what I expected, the audio section of this TV sounds as if the set were inside the box, something strange coming from Panasonic.I had to choose between this brand an Sony an I would have better choosen the other one.I Have tried any possible adjustment combination from the remote control in order to overcome the bad sound it produces and it's been really imposible.Luckyly I have it as part of a Sony home theater that means when playing a DVD the sound goes digitally to the Sony amplifier and that way it sound great, otherwise is lousy."
4,New perspective on an old tale,"This book tells the familiar story of a the little red hen who gets others to help her plant a garden to feed her brood. The story is told through a series of letters to and from the Little Red Hen and Hetty Hen, Little Red Riding Hood and Goldilocks, the Wolf, and even Peter Rabbit. Because of the continuously changing perspective in the authorship of the letters, the storyline would probably be too sophisticated for young readers to follow- -the book might be most appropriate for children 7 years and up. The plot, with its premeditated murder of the chicken, may also be a little scary for young ones. The vocabulary is fairly advanced and includes some suitable challenges for older readers. The book includes about 1200 words."
4,great drill.. but the other model is better,"I actually was going to buy this drill with the gel stuff, but I looked down the shelf at walmart and found the same drill with no gel, and an extra battery for the same price. Its a winner no doubt, but I must agree the case is pathetic. I took a dremel to the case and now its all good, but I shouldn't have had to do that..."
3,Why the high price?,In England the full season 6 was released & it currently goes for 11 pounds(about $19) so why is the price so high in the USA?? The show is great but my rating is for their high price!
5,The Kindness of Strangers,"As a social worker who has worked in the area of child sexual abuse for many years, I was impressed by Katrina Kittle's accuracy and sensitivity to this difficult subject. She has done her research and she covered the protocols and issues of law enforcement and child protection beautifully. She managed to get inside the head of a little boy who was horribly abused and see the world through his eyes---not an easy task. His coping mechanisms, his fears, his loyalty are all uncovered so skillfully; she really got him right. She also approached Sarah and her family in such a real way you feel as though you were living in that house. This is the best book I have read this year!"
3,Very Disturbing,"While the story is well written, the subject is very disturbing. I wish the summary inside had said what this book was really about. Saying that a child needs a foster home due to a tragedy is hardly the same as what really happens in this book: they lose him because they are running a child porn ring and the poor kid is their victim. Some things you can never get out of your head, sadly this is one of them."
1,Not at all worth recommending for reading,"In the first few pages, I couldn't stand reading about the foul language and dirty content that was going on. The characters (two of them) had an extremely bad relationship due to a death in the family, and I didn't like the anger and attitudes of these people. I also didn't like how the young boy, Danny, was exposed to his older brother's Hustler magazine, or the way Nate rudely avoided his mom."
1,Term paper style writing.,"I find it ironic that Ms. Kittle is a school teacher because her style of writing reminded me of a term paper rather than a good novel. This book was recommended on my purchase of ""The Murderer's Daughter"" by Randy Susan Meyers (which was an EXCELLENT read and highly recommended) and the two are nothing alike. There was very little to no character development. Sarah, the mother in the book, was obnoxiously naive and the writers attempt to convey the perspective of a 17 year old high school boy was enough to stop me dead in my tracks and move on to another book.If you like daytime soap operas, ignore my review and have at it!"
3,Disturbing Subject Matter,I think this book was well written but as the parent of a young child I had a hard time getting past the delicate subject matter.
3,Disturbing,I bought this book because it was a book club selection. I thought it was a littlefar fetched and meant to shock instead of trying to be more realistic. Iwouldn't reccomend it.
4,Very Realistic and Well Written,"Sarah Laden, recently widowed, is horrified to learn that her good friend has been accused of child abuse. The victim of the abuse is her son Danny's good friend Jordan. When Sarah's elder son Nate suggests that they should become Jordan's foster family Sarah agrees.This was a very moving and realistically written story about child abuse. The subject matter was sad and disturbing but the story was moving and well told. The details of daily life were vivid, the characters were very realistic and the relationships felt authentic. I really enjoyed the tender exchanges between Sarah and her teenage son Nate as they navigated through the rough terrain between childhood and adulthood.I was impressed by Katrina Kittle's writing and I will look for her work again."
4,"Quick ship, nice price",This book was not an easy read for me. It touches on sad uncomfortable subjects. I love to read. This book is well written but leaves you with a sad empty feeling. Not a feel good book
5,reader beware!,"WOW! Readers beware.....you won't be able to put this book down. I agree with an earlier reviewer...I wish that I had known what I was about to read before I bought this book. The outer cover is a little vague as to the exact subject matter (I picked the book up at SAMS). That said, I doubt I would have bought the book had I known what the basic subject matter is about. Yet, it is probably one of the best books I've read in a long time.It is a disturbing but compelling book, yet tastefully done (you won't believe this unless you read it). The fact remains that sexual child abuse does exist, and this book brilliantly exposes it to the reader. This author is an amazing writer, and I will look forward to more books by her. It is not for every reader, simply because of the subject matter, but it is an excellent book."
5,So real,"I work in ""Oakhaven"" and the mention of local businesses and ""crossing the river to get to the hospital"" were all very real to me. I am aware that child abuse knows no demographic but Kindness of Strangers made it all personal for me. It has helped me stop denying and start looking around for possible dangers to my grandchild."
5,loved this book,"The subject matter is quite disturbing but if you can get past that, this book is very well written and opens your eyes to things that could be happening right next door."
4,Working as desired,My son used it and he said it is good. i had no complains from him. It is Woking as advertised.
2,Wrong choice for me,"Well the mouthpiece might be great, but apparently is not the same size as a 3c for Cornet. We wasted our money"
5,My personal choice of mouthpiece,"Like many other reviewers have mentioned, mouthpieces are such a personal decision that it is tough to review them. Based on my personal experience of 20+ years of playing, I can say that I have gone back to the 3C a number of years ago after trying a variety of mouthpieces in college. I had used a 1 1/2C and then a 1 1/4C at my trumpet professor's instruction. With those mouthpieces I found myself having some range difficulties and lack of comfort while playing in the upper register. For me, the 3C is a good balance allowing easier upper register playing while keeping the tone that I desire. Also, as I have bigger lips I actually found it more beneficial to use a smaller rim to help focus my embouchure. This has worked very well for me and has helped me improve my playing."
1,Illegal Play,"The author uses an illegal play as a metaphor for his spiritual lifestyle. As John Stossel would say, give me a break! Wasn't this about a year after the Nebraska program had coddled a criminal named Lawrence Phillips, after he had beaten his girlfriend to a pulp?"
3,solid soundtrack,"It's a solid soundtrack, with a lot of old songs that makes you feel like you're in the past."
3,"Fair Price for ""Disposable"" LG Car Charger","With the LG name brand attached, I expected this $7 (at the time I bought it) car charger to last longer than the 2 years it did. That said, the current price of $2.63 (2/25/2012) is a fair price for this ""disposable"" LG car charger."
3,"Works, but...","The item arrived promptly and appeared to work, but the connector to the phone would not stay in place. I discovered that the metal clasps in the connector were installed backwards. So I carefully pried open the connector and reversed the position of the metals clasps. That solved the problem.The product is a low dollar product, so all I expected is for it to charge the phone battery. That's all it does. Unlike the factory version, the phone does not show that it is being charged, it just shows a 'full' battery when the charger is plugged in. Still, for the price, I have no complaints other than the minor inconvenience of having to fix the connector."
3,Can't beat the price,"bought this for a friend so she would have the ability to call in an emergency if her cell phone batteries were completely dischared. Phone operated OK when fully discharged and car charger plugged in cigarette lighter receptacle-note on some cars ignition has to be turned on and on others you can just plug in and start charging.When charging, the cell phone screen did not indicate charging was occurring but the phone after several hours appeared to be charged."
3,hydro pump rh1400,"i purchased the hydropump many months ago the pump is working after a number of fixes. soon after the pump was installed it begun to leak water. the hotline number told me to tighted the screws, which i did. this screw tighting did not stop the leakage of water. i sent the pump back before they could send me a new. i installed the new pump. i also went to a pool store to buy a better rubber hose. the one that was in the box was a much thinner rubber than the one i purchased at the pool store. next i purchased a 15 amp battery charger. this charger had differnt options that you could set. in the dc ups mode the charger simultaneously power the dc load (the pump) as well as the battery. the battery charger that is provided is very weak in comparison to samlex battery charger. i hope this will be some help and questions you can asked before purchased"
2,Trash,One does not work at all. I should be able to write 3 words or 10 words. I should be my choiuce. I brought the product.
4,Unleash The Logistic regression,This book is very useful for who wants to learn and apply the logistic regression in practice. Books style and sas version are a bit old. It should be updated. If it happens my mark might be five star. There is also Paul's another book about Survival that now i am reading now.
4,Coming Up From The Deep End,"The Cardinal Sin, are at first glance, a band trying to cash in on Alkaline Trio's sound; the punk is dark and moody, the guitars jangle and crash and the bass hums while the drums are sparatic and heavy, hell, even the lead singer sounds like Matt Skiba, but the Sin have a sound that's more organic and heavier than what the casual listener might expect. ""Where We Shine"" is about the weakest song on this EP, but it's still great and it only gets better until the end, with ""Quarter Life Crisis"" standing out as the best. All in all, give the Cardinal Sin some time and they very well may surprise us with a more evolved disc of doom."
1,unknown,"From what I can read about this product it sounds good, but there is no picture. I will not buy anything that I can't see what it looks like. I'd love to try it but I need to see it so I will know if it is what I'm looking for. Thank You."
5,Sensational,"If you are a fan of this talanted singer, this is a must have dvd. Everyone knows that this gal can out sing her contemperaries, but what they may not know is that she is an amazing stage performer with great charisma and energy. Christina connects with her audience and displays a true love and commitment to her fans.This ""Live in the UK"" show is both emotionally moving and sexy. The many dancers add a wonderful element to the performance ,and Christina interacts with them tremendously.Don`t wait. Order this NOW."
5,Xtina Rules,Christina Aguilera is the best performer ever and she has the most powerful and beatiful voices in music today. She is at the top of the music business and should never stop ever
4,One Of My Favorite Releases From Her,"Honestly, Christina has fallen way off the map today compared to the peak she was at in this DVD. It's almost sad to watch now realizing where she has gone after the heat she brought here. This concert is super entertaining and a must have for concert DVD lovers like myself. She entertains from beginning to end."
5,stripped dvd,"I did not get a chance to go to her concert, so i purchased the DvD. I loved it , it was proberbly one of the best concerts i have seen. she is a true artist. she really sings her songs. and performed to them. Each song has a themed performance that fit perfectly with the song. I loved it. It was worth every cent. can't wait to buy her next cd."
4,Talented,These were the days when Christina knew how to show off her talent. She still has it but has lost her understanding of how to put it to good use. She has an amazing voice and sings really well on this DVD - I thought she put on a good show.
5,Great Show !!!!!,"I WASN'T A BIG FAN OF CRISTINA AGUILERA, BUT I BOUGHT THIS DVD, AND NOW I LOVE HER.THIS IS A GREAT SHOW. I REALLY LIKED IT"
5,A MUST for ANY Xtina fan!,"I was lucky enough to see her Stripped concert -- twice! It was just awesome! I didn't see the WB special, but if it is half as xciting as the concert... She covers a lot of her Stripped album, a few off her self-titled and Spanish albums, Lady Marmalade, and of course some Etta James covers. If you are any type of fan, this disc is for you. It's great if you saw the concert, but even better if you didn't get to see it.My recommendation is it get it as soon as you can!"
1,did not fit 2000 wrangler,"Was advertised to fit 2000 wrangler 2.5L engine. Does not fit. Too long for the airbox, you can jam it into the airbox, but it bends the air filter upwards in the middle, creating space for a considerable amount of anything to be sucked into your engine. Not pleased d/t being useless to me."
2,Wrong size for my Jeep,"Item was listed as fitting a 2004 Jeep Wrangler 2.4l but what I received was the 4.0l version, I think. Either way it didnt fit my Jeep. Thats what I get for buying auto parts on Amazon..."
5,Gift,Bought these as a gift and boy was she happy! She said the shows were awesome and could have sat and watched all three seasons back to back!
2,Not so good,"half of the disks are out of sync for the sound and picture, the casing is cracked, and some of the disks are scratched."
5,Gilmore Girls DVD,"Amazing product. As any GG-fan knows, the first three seasons were amazing, and now with the added extras? Perfect. Loved the interviews!"
1,hard to read,"the copy I got (with this cover) looked like it was typed (not on a computer, but on a typewriter) in an almost unreadable fancy font. The words repeated in every sentence of innumerable lists, an unbelievable number of self-surveys, and LONG SENTENCES AND IMPORTANT IDEAS TYPED WITH ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, plus the fuzzy duplication of pages made this a long slog through the theory. I would only recommend it for someone determined to suffer on the road to leadership."
2,Not Worth It,"I purchased this product thinking that it would be just what I was looking for in a head wrap.The material is too light for my needs,as I do a lot of bicycling and I needed a head wrap to be used for helmut comfort and warmth. ""Not So"" with this item.Had to return it. Maybe I will have better luck next time selecting such an item."
2,"Great sound, poor video.","This review is for the Brilliant Classics import from the Netherlands, as pictured above. Andre Rieu and his orchestra have found a wonderful niche in the music industry, somewhere between serious classical and a ""pops"" concert. This looks like an orchestra that would be a lot of fun to play in. The musicians are all very talented. The sound on this disc is very good. Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst in my entire collection of over 200 DVD. The compression is so bad, especially for the background scenes, that the movie looks like a ""stop-action"" movie, with the picture renewing itself at only half-second intervals. When the camera pans quickly across the scenes, the picture breaks up into little square digital fragements. What a shame, as this is a great concert. The entry of the bagpipers will give you goosebumps. Get his Tuscany DVD first. That one has excellent video."
3,Electronic ignition doesn't work more than 20% of the time,"On the positive side, the brightness of the lantern is far superior to most other lanterns, including several of Coleman's. The base is also more stable that earlier base styles.Unfortunately, the electronic ignition simply isn't reliable. A call to Coleman on this produced advice that it's not a good idea to follow. It was to keep the gas on at a high flow rate while continuing to press the ignition button. The problem with that is that the area inside the glass fills rapidly with gas. If the ignition doesn't work until, say, the 10th try, you've got a spark contacting all that accumulated gas. Recipe for trouble there. Same principle applies if you give up on the electronic igniter and use a match without first letting the accumulated gas dissipate.A smaller point is that the estimate on how long a small propane can will last is too high. They last about 2 1/2 hours if the lantern is operating at the highest brightness level."
5,Upperman's Simplification of the COT,"I've read and used various COT based theories and found none of them compensated for the variations from one commodity to another, making it hard to learn the unique characteristics of each. Floyd's system solves this problem and adds very precise yet simple entry, exit and stop strategies, that to me make good sense. His mathmatical formulas are his property, and he deserves being rewarded for his efforts. Sure someday they may become public knowledge, but how many of us have the math & statistical background to reinvent Floyd's ""wheel""?"
1,with a caveat,"that I have not read his book..but have gone through the material on his website, which is expensive, and more complex then need be. I do not know his success rate..but anytime something is made more complex than necessary..caveat emptor.I have read Larry Williams new COT book. It is a great read..simple and inexpensive. Larry's book is the best kept secret on Wall Street.."
1,Just an expensive ad for his paid website,"Like too many others (DeMark, Summa, etc.), all he does is tell you that he has a magic set of indicators---but you need to purchase them on his website.Save your money; I sent it back."
1,Borderline Useless,"As other reviewers have said, this book is ""proprietary"" in nature and close to useless for serious study of the COT data. As a student of this data for over 20 years I always look for any additional insight from authors. One would be best served buying the Steve Briese or Larry Williams book."
4,Good for the drills alone,"Some of the conditioning things are a little dated, but the sport specific drills are well worth the purchase of this book."
5,a must for rugby union enthusiasts,This book is excellent. It is very informative and the ilustrations are easy to understand.
4,Milestone for my Saz playing...,"Actually solo work by great Saz master from Azerbejan. Style of playing never spotted by me in Turkish or raw Middle Eastern Music. I'm saz/oud player and I cannot imagine that I could go any further without knowledge of such a masterpiece.Lot of improvised music, rich texture, very expressive.Recommended for all who are into ethnic music and all those who are looking for highly expressive solo performances..."
2,college student broke,was looking for a way to save money on texts books for the semester. i needed this book however i did not know the whole book was going to be done for me...too pricey for book to have so much mileage
5,awesome and lucky,Glad i found this book for cheap and the person keep the book in great condition and took a little long but not bad if your willing to wait for it.
1,May not work with older or refurbed PS2s,I purchased this title at a Best Buy (mistake number one due to their return policy) and found that it would not play on my original design Gen 1 PS2. This has happened only once before with a game called Ford Racing. The only common factor is that both disks had blue optical side surfaces. Not the usual clear or black like normal.Don't know if this means anything other than my experience had been unsatisfactory.Buyer beware.
4,great game,"I bought this game only because it has bubble bobble, the rest of the games aren't that good."
1,very sensible - on the surface,"Mr Edell is a strange individual. He sounds intelligent, humerous, and sensible...unless you actually pay attention to what he is writing or saying! Then it becomes manifest that this individual is not quite sane. Why are most Blacks incarcerated? Because of ""police racism"", says ""Doctor"" Edell. Normal men are secretly ""turned on"" by watching homosexual men says Dr E. A mixture of good advice and madness. Do yourself a favor and save your money. There are a lot of better books to buy!"
1,One Star Lookers - Think about this....,"What Dr. Edell says and believes in is -all- based in hard science. Anyone that wants to refute him on -any- item, like those found in any of the negative reviews here, should call in on his radio show and put their mouth and ears where there ego is."
5,"Eat, Drink & Be Merry",Funny yet very informative. You'll be surprised at some of his comments. They're all good.
3,Good book but tiring to read,"Overall, this book was very informative and provided unique insight to a diverse range of health subjects. I appreciated Dr. Dean Edell's commentary and analysis on several health related issues, some controversial. But after 200 pages, I found myself tired of reading this book. I think it was partly due to how Dr Dean Edell wrote his analysis of issues or health stories that were either ridiculous or very serious. In some sections of the book, Dr Dean Edell's writing conveyed a serious mission to dispell a bad health story or prognosis. I found this informative and helpful but at times this book read more like the sermons of street preachers. Reading 300 pages written in this style can either invigorate or exhaust a reader. Despite the great subjects covered, I found myself very tired after reading this book that I probably will never have the energy to read another book by Dr Dean Edell again."
4,Burn the FAT AWAY! Loose weight while you sleep!,"It good to see someone dispelling the notion that you must plunk down $900 for that treadmill before you can get ""healthy"". The book is very entertaining and most of the things that Dean Speaks of - intellegent, conscience thinking - will not suprise most of us. It's still good to see that someone is spouting it in the mainstream. Dean does raise some frightening thoughts - are there that many low IQ types that keep these infomercial health peddlers in biz? FINALLY, ANOTHER BOOK THAT POINTS OUT HOW DUMB THIS AMERICAN SOCIETY, BY LARGE, IS GETTING!"
4,This book is so good I bought it after reading it from the library,"Common sense, not hype. That's this book. If you're looking for the latest medical fad to scare you this is not the one to get. This is real, and enduring medical advice. This one will be so ten, fifty, one hundred years from now; it's not going to change. It's told in great humor and Dr. Dean Edell is my kind of doctor who tells it just exactly like it really is and not how a lot of folks might want it to be. Im an RN and I know most people dont want to know real medical facts, just the sensational and crazy! If you're the type to look for UFO's in your medical advice, leave this one alone. If, however, you want the real thing, get this. Deb, in Texas"
1,Biased and unresearched in modern nutrition/naturopathy!,"I would not recommend this book. He is probably an intelligent man(memorizing the drugs of his profession takes dedication) but has no stand on nutrition/quantum physics/biochemistry in which to have a valid opinion in the areas of nutrition(fats/oils, supplements, detoxification etc.) naturopathy(homeopathy, chiropractics, herbology, reflexology etc.) His ""pushy"" writing style is offensive, blunt, biased, closeminded. On the positive side this book is written in great laymen style. So is the newspaper! Do yourself a favour buy some organic produce with your money instead of purchasing this book! Corey"
1,The book is not a total truth,Dr. Dean either didn't learn well his lesson from his youth not to make judgements without being fully informed or intentionally ignores the existing scientific validation of so called alternative medicine. The book is full of judgements but lacks the solid information.
5,Avec plaisir,"How refreshing it is to read a health book that doesn't scare you. How great that someone could actually write a bestselling health book that's not about dieting.Dr. Dean presents such a rich infostream of great stories about health on-air...if you want to keep up to date about all the latest stories he's talking about on-air, you can visit his web site."
5,"Eat, Drink, and Be Merry","This book is such a refreshing look at the ""alternative"" treatment industry. I commend Dr. Edell for having the courage to stand up for the scientific method and the double-blind experiment. Dr. Edell gored many an ox, but he has given me hope that ""science can triumph over superstition"" once again."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"I've only heard of Dr. Dean, never really seen him, but now I'll make a point to tune in. He brought a fresh, objective, very funny at times approach to the basic health questions we all want answers to but find confusing based on modern medicine."
1,a real waste of money,The book feels like it was written in one afternoon. People lookingfor solid information on playing the keyboard will be disappointed.The book ends even before it starts. There are inconsistencies in theway the instructions are explained in the text. This continues thetradition of poor music books by Warner.
1,Please put honest reviews!,"I bought this album based on reviews and an older album by abed azrie. I am sorry to say this, but I was very disappointed by both artists. The performance is almost like those of amateurs."
4,Windshield Car Mount for T-Mobile G1,"Received product before scheduled time. Product used to hold my G1, where I connect the output to my car stereo so I can listen to my music that is on the G1. I recommend this product to anyone who is in the same situation."
3,This product is nice but it does not suck,"Trying to get this to stick to the window while you are adjusting it's many adjustment angles is simply not doable. It also has a habit of just falling off the window if you drive over any bumps (I know - this is not a problem for most people driving on our well maintained highways), but is does happen.I'm going to try some Duct Tape, because I like the design and adjustments, (and I already bought it) but I would not recommend it if you are not into using other methods to get it to suck up to the window."
5,great,Item arrived quickly in new condition - works great as a replacement for my original cable that was too short for my current office situation.
2,Disappointing,"This is a cheap cord. It does work, but I would recommend paying more and buying a higher quality product."
5,Perfect!,This cable worked perfect for me. I needed the extra length to power my monitor for my new office setup as the outlet location was too far away for the standard 6ft length. Worked as expected with no issues.
4,"Sands very well, dust collection worthless.","I picked one of these sanders up to replace an old Makita quarter sheet palm sander that keeps spitting the pad off. while sanding. I like the operation of the random orbit better as it leaves no swirl marks, and makes quick work of the VERY uneven pine stock I am working with. This sander uses a hook & loop type sanding media, so you have to be careful not to pick up the sticky back sanding media for this sander. The dust collection system uses the holes in the mounting pad and with them plugged up you are in for a dust storm in your shop! A quick swap to the right sanding media, full cleaning of the sander, and a retry resulted in much less dust, but still not low enough dust levels to not need a dust mask.Overall I am happy with the purchase. I do not believe there is a sander out there that has dust collection that works as advertised. This one is as good or better than the competitors in its category."
1,shoddyt,"tool was not satisfactory.did not keep on keeping on.worked o k when new ,just had very little sevice life."
1,Almost Useless,"The only thing a beginner can learn from this VCD is how to hold a violin since a video is better than a book. This VCD doesn't teach how to hold bow. This VCD talks about how to choose a case, history of violin, how to care the violin, etc. One can learn much more from a book than from this VCD. Given its content, it's worth..."
4,A note about the physical construction,"You can see it on the photo, but I want to reiterate that the pods use staggered cable ends. These are designed for situations where the cable turns as it leaves the connection.That is a nice feature when that happens (typically, where your cables turn either up or down at the connection, and the connections are in a vertical row).However, there are some situations where this is a problem. For example, the 3 connectors are not in a row. Or you are making the turn in such a way that the colors do not match.This design would be improved by interchangeable colors where the shortest radius turn matches your component scheme. One other improvement (in case you're reading, Monster) would be to imprint the cable number on the pod to make it easier to reorder. (Fortunately, Amazon lets you easily view all of your past product orders.)Other than that, typically good Monster Cable fit and finish."
4,"An excellent, well illustrated book.","I found Station to Station to be an excellent broad work on the topic. I felt that while it didn't spend too much time on any particular station, it did give good detail on most all major stations of architectural value, including the somewhat obscure. All in all, a book worth reading."
1,High School Book Report Quality,"With a book title like Marketing Minds - you would think you would get some keen insight - but that is not what you get from Marcia Layton Turner's brief, unsubstantial book. Surprisingly she does not seek out these marketing minds to speak to them and only offers us a short bio and some quotes from third sources. It really reads like a high school book report and offers zero insight. There is one passage which stands out. She writes, ""Remember the Tylenol tampering scare? In contrast to executives in that situation, Nike made all the right moves (with sweat shop negative PR)"" - are you kidding me - that is completely backwards. Unbelievable - a published book with this kind of a factual error! Don't waste your time."
4,Go Gos Wild at the greek dvd,"This is a great dvd. It was a home video release back in 1984. The tracks are Head Over Heels, Our Lips Are Sealed, Forget That Day, We Got The Beat, Turn To You, Tonight, You Thought, Yes Or No, I'm With You, This Town, Can't Stop The World, Vacation, and I'm The Only One. The only down side to this dvd is that, it is a Japanese format. I couldn't play in my dvd player, but could on my computer dvd drive. I had to change the format on my computer under different countries, and regions."
3,Acceptable version of a great concert experience,"The content of the video is amazing and brought back great memories, although the tape was a bit worn.Wish they'd put this on DVD!"
4,Excellent but....,"The sound and images of this product are excellent, but I am disappointed that there are no subtitles or English libretto included. I had to go to a Minnesota public radio website to get English and German lyrics. Fine but not really what I had in mind."
2,rather old-fashioned,"The book is not bad, but rather old-fashioned in its content and in the way it approaches the material. It gives an introduction into CFD as it was twenty or thirty years ago, when writing a two-dimensional code was considered THE CFD. The book provides very little in terms of helping a practitioner to prepare for work with modern CFD software."
3,Not the best but worth the two hours,"It's not the best ""last man"" type genre but it has some really funny parts. The sad thing is the guy doesn't know what he has until...won't spoil it for you. Personally I don't know why they never moved into a hotel and got rid of the bodies. Jeri Ryan was a surprise because I'd only really seen her in Voyager. She can really act and never once did I think of her as Seven of Nine--which is saying something when she looks that good! All the acting is great and the twists at the end, although not surprising, are wonderful to watch. I'd recommend it and not recommend ""The New Guy"" DVD."
5,Great Subtle Satire,"Some people (like the last guy) totally miss the point. I saw this film in New York and while it was a low budget , it was a brilliantly funny. The lead Arnot is terrific as an average schmoe who is left with this gorgeous woman (Jeri Ryan) who STILL doesn't like him, even though he is the last man on Earth!! The film just shows that even if you wipe out every one else and get things the way you want them, the world can still suck (if you're an idiot loser). It was very Albert Brooks like. I guess it was over the head of some people, but it is totally smart, sharp and worth seeing. And the soundtrack and quality are great."
5,One of the FUNNIEST MOVIES I saw last year...or any year!,This was a total surprise. I picked this up with little knowledge of what I was in for. What I was in for was the best comedy of 2002. I have watched it 6 times since purchasing it and it actually gets funnier every time I see it. The performances are terrific and with only 3 actors that's important! But it's the story and the writing that are brilliant.I would advise anyone who likes to laugh...BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!
3,Not the worst & not the greatest,"This movie had its ups and downs. It wasnt particularly too funny but it deffinately kept me entertained. Some things could have been fixed, such as having half the film be a fake documentory. Which was relatively annoying at times but the preformance of the actors and the plot of the film made up for this. If you are looking for something to laugh your ass off with keep looking, try Orgazmo or Mallrats. If your looking for a good movie that has little funny parts that will just keep you entertained, this is the film for you."
1,BORING AND IRRITATING,"This is a cheaply produced movie that manages to make all three actors look bad. I didn't think it was possible, but with either none or very poorly done makeup, even Jeri Ryan is unatractive.The basic story idea probably is okay, but the characters are so self indulgent, the movie is very irritating. The video and sound quality are very poor. Don't waste your time or money."
4,A fun read for anyone who's been in a taxi.,"This confirms it. Taxi drivers are an eclectic group. This book gives us a peek inside and a look at the good, bad, and ugly of a day in the life of a taxi driver. ""Last Bus"" gives us a glance at the interaction with police. In ""Mom's Kitchen"" we can feel the community interaction at play. Albino Rossie's Funeral is another must read chapter, oh and that crazy lady to Las Vegas....that was my favorite. I will recommend this book to my friends, for sure."
3,Moderately useful,"While the information available in this book is factual, it is far from complete. The book may be useful as a starting point for older children's research or for research for brief elementary school projects; however, middle school students will need much more in depth information. It also does not have information about lesser-known tribes. I found the book ""500 Nations"" to be a better all-around resource on this subject"
5,Ship of Dreams,Excellent photo's and the story reminds me of my childhood hearing about the sandman. The photo's have so much you can stop and discuss with your child and/or have them pick out. I would highly recommend this book
5,A Mom's Favorite,"As a preschool teacher, I am always on the lookout for that one book that is written and illustrated beautifully. Dean Morrissey has done it with this book. My students and my daughter were mesmerized by the realistic illustrations and I loved the story. My daughter is now ten years old and still looks into the sky to find her ""star"", she can always pick it out. I find myself buying this book again and again and giving it to friends expecting babies and they have expressed how much they liked it too! This is a book that I intend to hand down in the future so that my daughter's children will be caught up in it's magic. Thank you Dean Morrissey for such a beautiful book. Oh, by the way, I just recieved The Christmas Ship and I adore this one too!"
2,PDA battery,The price for this battery was right! I think perhaps the battery was real old stock and as weak as the battery I was replacing.
5,Back to work,"I hadn't used my PDA for a while because the battery needed replacement. For a very reasonable price, this battery got me up and running again. Works well, though I haven't tested the full extent of its charge. I have to say, though, that it keeps me going longer than the battery the PDA came with."
2,Not Quite Average,"The consistency is a little weird due to the types of grains. And I must ask,why in the world would each cup be equal to 2 servings? It's a waste for those who are not doubling up on servings. It takes 5 minutes to prepare at which time the oatmeal is barely warm and needs to be reheated. I expected fresher, bolder flavors. Typically a 'gourmet' type oatmeal in single servings has fresher flavor from the fruit and even a little natural sweetness negating the need for sweeteners, but not this one. Quaker Real Medley's outshine this product by far."
3,Convenient but watch out the sugar,I bought this product based on [...]I liked the taste but it has very high sugar content.I am trying to lose weight and more than 15g of sugar per day severely affects belly fat.So after using couple of times I gave away rest
3,"tastes great, but very pricey","quanity is adequate for a snack, kinda filling i guess, tastes great, but paying [...] for 6 of these is not worth it IMO, 12 for [...] would be an excellent value for this product"
5,"Hearty, Healthy, Flavorful!","Just tried this today...and it was delicious! I have tried Dr. McDougall's Non-Dairy Peach and Raspberry Hot Cereal before, and loved it. Maple Hot Cereal is very flavorful, hearty, and filling!I love Dr. McDougall's products, because they are so natural, with whole grain raw oats (not processed, instant oats), and use soy milk powder to give a creamy texture with out all of the added sugars that normal oatmeal products have.Also, this oatmeal is wonderful, because of the portion size. A usual instant oatmeal packet is skimmpy on size- I usually need two packets for breakfast. This product, however, is a good portion size, and it is convenient because you don't need a bowl to mix it (you use the product container itself, and just add water).Dr. McDougall's Non Dairy Hot Cereal products are the greatest store bought, and the closest to homemade oatmeal you can get!"
4,Average taste but love that it's organic,"I like a lot of McDougall's foods. This one tasted fine but wasn't outstanding. I had to add brown sugar to it as it was kind of bland for me, but I guess oatmeal is kind of bland anyway. I likely will order again but not as often. I love that it is organic and vegan so that's why I gave it 4 stars. You don't get that with most packaged oatmeals. I really like the ease of making it too. If you really want an outstanding hot breakfast, I would suggest McDougall's peach and raspberry cereal over this one. It is very tasty and has fruit in it."
2,"Tastes great, but not that healthy","This stuff does taste good and is convenient to prepare. The downside is that the nutritional info applies to HALF the container. Who would eat half? When you read the specs and double the numbers, it just isn't that healthy. When you eat all the product, you are consuming a lot of calories, carbs, sugar and sodium...way too much for one meal. Also, a breakfast high in protein is much more beneficial.As an aside, I have never understood why manufacturers do this serving size deception. I am sure there are adults out there who eat half a can of soup or half a breakfast cereal cup; but when most adults have soup for lunch, they prepare and eat all the soup, and likewise with this product for breakfast.There are worse choices, but better ones as well."
5,Vegan hot cereal that tastes great,"Add water, microwave for less than 2 minutes. Let set then eat.Great for a busy morning or a healthy filling snack."
1,"Serious paint issue, i would advise against buying...","Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off & it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized. We have not used it since & had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as 'paint eating' & consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes."
3,Good but not so durable,"I liked this toy but I found it didn't hold up well getting in and out of the trunk. We use our stroller all the time and don't take it off each time. Also my daughter got bored with it. It was good for the beginning especially the butterfly because she could chew on it, but only when she could reach."
1,Waste of money,"Like everyone else said, this does not fit my Graco stroller. We even tried to attach it to our umbrella stroller with no luck. On top of it, the little snack tray in the ladybug CONSTANTLY falls out. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
2,"Cute, but.....","May 2005 - This is a cute toy. However there are some significant drawbacks. It does NOT fit any stroller. You really need to have a tray there for this to sit on. But that is not enough. The base of the toy is round, so it doesn't sit flat even on a standard stroller tray. It rolls back and forth, making it frustrating to play with. When it rolls toward your child, the caterpillar can't spin. When it rolls away from your child, his short little arms can't reach to bring it back into a useful position. We had a little butterfly on one end that you could twist and turn. It snapped off within the first 2 weeks (probably from getting pulled repeatedly into the stroller tray) . Cute toy - but needs some revisions."
4,My daughter loves it but...,My daughter loves this but like others have said it doesn't fit on the Graco Quattro Travel System. I have gotten it to work but sometimes it gets in the way of latching the snack tray on the front. I still love it and so does my daughter.
2,"Cute toy, but not durable","I bought this stroller toy for my son. We have an Eddie Bauer full size stroller. It did not fit on the stroller. After a lot of determination I got it to attatch to the stroller. After a couple months of play the snack cup lid broke off exposing a shapr piece and I had to throw it away. It is overall an adorable toy, but not worth wasting your money on it."
2,Not for all strollers,"This bar is very cute, however it does not fit on the Graco stroller bar very easily. It is so difficult to attach and it winds up spinning over so that all of the toys are in his lap instead of upright. Very unhappy with this, maybe it would be fine on a narrower bar."
5,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - GET THIS TOY!,"My son has had this toy since he was 8-months old. He's now 11-months & still loves it. You can use it on a stroller or on a high chair (as in restaurant high chairs). With this bar, he always has toys & always has something to play with. In fact, wherever we go, kids come up to the stroller to play with this. It's like a kid magnet. I also attach additional toys to it with different links. If your kid gets bored when you take him/her out, do yourself a favor & buy this. I can't tell you how many friends have bought it based on watching my son."
3,Paint chipped,"I usually love Sassy toys, but this one was a disappointment. The main reason I didn't like it is the ""bug"" teether paint chipped. My 8 month old son was chewing on it and when I looked over at him he had blue paint chips on his chin."
1,BEWARE - crinkle material may be chewed off!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 7 months old, and had trouble fitting in on the stroller bar. It did fit, but not well. That's not the reason, however, for the low rating.My daughter chewed off the crinkle material on one of the bug's wings, and almost choked on it!!! The material is very thin, and could cover a windpipe, I'm afraid. The toy is cute, but if you have a ""chewer"", beware!!!"
2,cute but not user friendly,"I bought this adorable thing for my 6 month old son. He absolutly loves playing with it, but it does not fit correctly on the stroller. the straps are not long enough, and when he gets excited playing with it he knocks it over. It is not very secure. Not exactly what I had in mind when I purchased it but it now sits on his playroom floor. I recommend that you test it, secure it on your stroller before purchasing it, because it might just be a waste of money and end up sitting on the playroom floor like ours."
2,Fun But Not Practical,"I don't recommend this toy, but we use it, anyway, only because my daughter likes the toys so much and loves being able to grab her Cheerios out of the bug! She loves playing with it...when it stays upright. It says that it will fit stroller trays, but it doesn't fit ours (Graco Cirrus Travel System). I had to attach more velcro for a longer piece and it still doesn't hold the toy upright in place, it slides down and rolls towards my daughter. On restaurant highchairs it stays in place better, but still not as it should."
4,Not as enthused as I thought.,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn't have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Does not fit!,"This toy was a waste of my money. It did not fit on my stroller without some modification and even then, it didn't stay put. It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it. And it had a removable piece in it. Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out. And on top of that, she decided that she'd rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself! Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too). I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up. Needless to say, I did that about twice and then tossed the toy in the trash."
3,Misleading toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was able to sit in his stroller. I to have the Quattro Tour travel system and although I can make it fit by tighting the velcro staps it never stays straight. I always have to keep spinning the toy around so my son can reach the toys. Also, two of the pieces already broke off of the bar within two weeks of having it. I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing."
1,Didn't fit either stroller!,We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!! It was a complete waste of money! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
2,Don't buy this one.,"This toy is really cute. I got it for a gift, but wasn't able to use it for my first child because, like everyone else stated, it didn't fit on the stroller or anything else for that matter so I stored it away. Now, with my second child, I tried putting it on my new Graco stroller and it doesn't fit this stroller either. My husband ""rigged"" it somehow for me, but it wasn't easy and I don't know how long it'll last this way. I would buy something else if I were you."
2,Doesn't stay upright,"The stroller bar is very cute, but I can't get it to stay upright on the snack tray. Cheerios would be everywhere if I filled the little bug cup. I've also found that, at least so far (7 mos), just sitting in the stroller and riding around is entertainment enough for my little travel companion."
4,Not the best but it is entertaining,"Our daughter got this for Christmas when she was 5 months old and has seemed to enjoy it. She loves opening and closing the lady bug and chewing on the crinkle bug. Like a lot of other people, we do have problems keeping it upright. We have a Combi Soho stroller and the straps won't tighten on it so it slides forwards or backwards (when we bought this we had a Peg Perego stroller and it fit very well). For this reason we won't put any food in the lady bug cup. She also likes to take the cup out of the lady bug and we've come close to losing it a few times. We do have to remove it from the stroller every time we fold it up, so it takes a minute or two to put it back on everytime.It does keep her entertained so we are glad that we have it. If we had to get another one we would make sure that we found one that fit snuggly on the stroller."
3,Thought it would last longer,"Very pretty and fun for about 5 months. Then one day she actually pulled the whirly butterfly off the contraption entirely! Thankfully it wasn't super sharp under there, but I retired the toy after that. We also had difficulty attaching it to our Graco stroller and it was nearly impossible to keep stationary on whatever we did manage to attach it to. And the ""snack cup"" was pretty much used to teach ""open and closed"" -the insert came out quite easily and was played with elsewhere! Still, she seemed to have a lot of fun with it while it lasted."
4,Fun toy,Our daughter got this for Christmas when she was 5 months old and has been delighted with it. She pulls herself towards it so she can chew on the bumblebee. We have a Peg Perego stroller and it fits perfectly onto the front bar. We do have to unlatch one side of the toy to fold up the stroller and sometimes it's a pain to thread the velcro back under the toys when we're trying to attach it quickly. This toy does a great job of entertaining her while in the stroller.
2,Cute Bar but...,"This is a very cute toy, my son loved it but as other reviews stated it does not fit on anything. We travel a lot back and forth from VT to SC (16 hours) with baby in car seat and thought this would be so handy, well as long as I sat in the back and held the bar in place he loved it. So in the end it got brougth inside and is not put away in a box. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want to modify or rig something up to make it stay for your child."
4,"Cute, needs improvement, but glad I bought it","I was hesitant to purchase this toy because of all the negative reviews. However, I purchased it today and had no problem attaching it to the tray of my Graco Metrolite stroller dispite other people's comments stating that it did not attach. I agree, it would be better if the bottom of the bar was flat. The cup inside the snack container constantly falls out, I will leave it out for good. Overall, I think it is a good toy and my daughter enjoys it. I am happy I purchased it,"
3,"OK, but doesn't keep upright","I bought this product because it was so cute. My little baby (8 months) likes it too.I had some problems attaching it to the stroller. I have a Graco Quattro Tour stroller. I kind of attached it not directly on top of the tray but more next to the tray (towards my baby). So that's not so bad. However, the worst part about this toy is the round base. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed it. Because my little baby pulls on things, the bar constantly tips over. So I have to adjust it all the time.Also, I find the snack bowl pretty useless."
3,"Cute, but frustrating","I saw this toy and thought it looked like so much fun; a great purchase for entertaining my daughter. However, after recieving my order, I couldn't figure out how to attach the Busy Bug Bar onto my stroller. I have the fairly common Graco travel system stroller, with a snack tray for her. I finally figured out the problem; the velcro attachment just isn't long enough to reach around the tray. So in order to use this toy, I will have to purchase extra velcro to attach it."
1,Didn't fit on anything we owned,"I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless."
1,A complete waste of time and money,This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste. First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.
1,disappointed mom,"I bought this stroller toy for my 7 month old. As others stated, it did not fit around the tray of my Graco stoller....not even close. Big disappointment. I will be returning this item."
3,Busy Bar keeps baby busy!,"This busy bug is a wonderful idea. It also keeps my baby busy while we are out and about and he is in his stroller for a long time. The only problem I find with the busy bar, is that it does not stand up completely while it is straped to the bar of the stroller. I am always picking it up so that my baby can play with it. I think it depends on the style stroller you have. My friend has the same busy bar, and it works just fine for her and always stays up. I would recommend it, even though I am always fixing it, my son enjoys it very much, especially to teethe on!"
4,Great toy!,"This toy is great - my 6 month old loves it! It's a little difficult to strap on the stroller over the cup holders, but it's do-able, and worth the effort."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn't attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup. They need to redesign it with a flat base. There is one company that has one with the flat base - it's made by Kids11, Inc -and my daughter LOVES IT! Don't waste your money on this one - you, and your little one will just be frustrated!"
3,Not so bad,"This toy keeps my 7 month-old daughter busy for at least 15 minutes, which is acceptable. She would rather play with other small toys when in the carriage, but this works for a short-time and she will move the butterfly the most. It fits on the Graco Metrolite by connecting the 2 ties over the tray so I have no complaint with the fit. I use it for the yard only periodically because it only have 3 or 4 little toys on it."
1,Doesn't work for us,DOES NOT FIT ALL STROLLERS. At least not my Graco stroller. I had to fight to get it attached to the tray. My son can pull it over onto himself with ease. I'm constantly moving it back upright. Just does not work. Someday someone is going to have to explain to my why I can buy a highchair with toys attached but can't seem to get something that works for my stroller.
2,"cute, but not for Graco strollers","I thought it was so cute and that it would easily entertain, but it does not fit on to my Graco Blackwell. I already unpacked it, so I can't return it. It's still cute and I might try to velcro it on something else, but the title ""stroller bar"", it isn't..."
3,needs improvement,I bought this for my 6 month old. It is very bright and colorful. I was so disappointed with the way it fit on my stroller.It doesn't sit where it should.We are also not able to close the stroller with it on. We have not gotten much use out of it.
2,"""Fits ALL strollers????""","This is a very cute stroller toy, however, on the package it says ""Fits all strollers."" I have a Graco travel system (it came with the car seat) and tried to attach the toy to the bar which has a cup holder and is approximately 6 inches wide. The straps on the stroller toy were too short to fit around the bar. So the advertisement ""Fits all strollers"" is misleading. Graco is a well-known brand and it did not fit my stroller. Before you buy, be aware of this!!!!"
3,didn't fit on my Graco stroller,"I bought this before my daughter was born and it didn't fit on her stroller, carseat, or anything else she had. I don't know how well the velcro would hold if I did get it to fit on something. I could see how the snack cup would not be left in it place.She has played with it just on the floor but because she has toys to play with on the floor that are made to play with on the floor we gave it away.My daughter is 9 months old and we have not used a stroller toy at all. She never gets bored just going for walks in the park and through the mall. She likes to look around at different people and different things."
3,Ok,I think this toy looks really cute and i would like it if it fit on my sons stroller. The base is way to small for his stroller becase his has little snack areas on it.
1,Cute...but...,"Yes, this is a cute stroller toy! BUT it didn't work on either of my Graco strollers!!!!I tried to keep it on, but it just got smashed and it took up stroller seat space!There are many toys out there for cheaper, that actually work for the purpose they are intended for....don't waste your money on this."
1,Will not fit on my stroller!,"Cute toy, but it's no good to me if it won't fit on my stroller. I have a common Combi stroller and no matter how hard my husband and I tried, there was no way to secure the toy to the stroller. Too bad, because our daughter could not stop staring at the toy while we wrestled with it, trying to attach it to the stroller. It's going back to the store."
4,Doesn't fit my daughter's stroller,"This is such a cute toy but it doesn't fit our stroller. Also, the cup doesn't stay shut. When it's not attached my daughter loves it but when it's on the stroller she can't reach it and it doesn't stay put. We are going to return it this weekend. A suggestion would be to make the bar soft so that it can fit around the stroller bar."
4,Paint chipped off within two months!,"My son loved this toy bar on his stroller. The only problem is that the paint chips off. As you know, kids like to put everything in their mouths. One day, we noticed pieces of paint on our son's face and noticed he had gotten them from the toy bar! What a disappointment to have to throw this away so soon. I felt that for [the price], it should have been more durable than to only last for two months."
1,MUST READ!,My daughter liked to chew on everything when she was first cutting teeth. The first time I put the bar on the stroller she loved it. We were just enjoying our time at the mall when I looked down and she had blue and orange paint on her face and in her mouth. I did call Sassy and they told me the paint was non-toxic and they asked me to send the bar back to them and they gave me a credit. I just don't like the thought of the paint being in her mouth no matter what anybody tells me.
4,watch out for the orange legs they will disapear....,"I have a six month old son who adores this stroller bar I think it is overall worth buying.It is true it does not fit all strollers as easy as it says,but you can make it fit.My biggest problem is the detachable bug legs(snack cup)my son always had them in his mouth and i was constantly loosing them in stores.They come out way to easy.They recently got distroyed by my puppy I made a mistake of leaving my stroller in the house after a walk and she chewed them to pieces.Good news is I dont have to worry about loosing them anymore..."
3,Doesn't fit on Graco Quattro Tray,I rated it average for everything since I never actually got to use it with my almost-four month old baby girl. It would not fit on the stroller tray and I returned it... I don't know why they still sell this thing if it doesn't fit on a tray... but I'm sure it would be great for a shopping cart or a stroller with a bar.
4,"Much more like ""Leviathan"" in space.","I'm guessing that a lot of the people who have seen Lily C.A.T. are more anime people without a horror background. I have owned this movie on VHS for close to 15 years now, and I'm begging to see it released on DVD! This movie IS (if nothing else) a classic!There are few anime titles that approach the horror genre in this manner. It is far more like an American horror from the 80's than a Japanese horror from any time frame.If you grew up watching the 1980's space/underwater horror titles. Buy this now. You will get to see one of the rare instances where an anime pays homage to those great movies.If you have seen ""Leviathan"" then you will recognize this horror. Though it happens in space, it is a very similar situation - but remember this is an anime that predates Akira - It is a classic.Enjoy classic anime/horror fans!"
5,One Of The Best Christmas Albums Ever!,"This has to be my favorite Christmas album before 1990. There were many other excellent Christian artists who made Christmas albums in the 80s, but this one beats them all. I agree with Kimberly who said that this album contains the best version of Silent Night ever written. The best First Noel too. It is just the most upbeat, fun Christmas music you have heard. Many of these songs were played on Christian radio for decades, but have sadly been missing for the last few years. If you grew up with Christian music in the 80s, and you like Christmas music, this is an absolute MUST HAVE. Believe me, I have paid a bit extra to get my hands on rare music, and if any warrants it, this does. I have over 40-50 Christmas CDs, just by Christian artists, and it is a tradition that this is the first I listen to every year. If there ever was an album from the 80s that captured the 80s sound, and still remains timeless, this is it!"
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I was looking for a tape that was made (I believe originally) around 1988-1990. I was expecting that particular tape and the main feature (at least for me) I was looking for was not even on the VHS! What I really was looking for was the: "" Hasta Que Te Conici (Potpurri)"" version that is about 23-25 minutes long!The positive side is 'it did not cost me an-arm-and-a-leg so to speak!Kind of disappointing and however, what I am looking for I understand is very difficult to obtain or not available at all!Anyway, thanks for asking.George F. Kerkhoff"
1,"Bad product , did'nt fit on driver side, bent",What a ripoff to go thru all the work to put these in and the driver side was not even close to fitting.
2,Too hard to use,"I was told by my Dr. to get this brand, but the bulb was very hard to use...I never could get it up to 188 like it suggested. Will return."
5,The girls continue their ups and downs,"More fun and drama abound in the third season of this smartly written series, with the Lorelais dealing with many conflicts--some of their own making--involving Richard and Emily, the self-destructive Jess, explosive Paris Geller, and more.Rory shows her academic smarts but isn't too good at picking guys to fall in love with, while Lorelai and Luke seem to be edging closer to each other. In the meantime, the inn burns severely, leaving Lorelai and the hilarious, high-strung Sookie to hatch plans for a new place that they can manage together.The one character I find tragic is Lane Kim, who is musically gifted and spirited, but this spirit is crushed by her overly strict mother."
5,Gilmore Girls,Gilmore Girls is a nice story of a Mother and Daughter in a small town in Conn. It is fun and great for ages 10yrs and up. Both Mother's and Daughter's will enjoy the funny adventures.
2,Packaging broken,"I love Gilmore Girls and season 3 completes my collection, but when I opened the plastic wrap I found the DVD's floating freely inside. They're not damaged, but the plastic that holds them in place is completely broken off from the outside so they will never be able to stay put. I'm pretty disappointed that a new set of DVD's would arrive like this."
5,Excellent,"Love the Gilmore Girls, could watch the episodes over and over again...okay I do. Each season that is released seems to have better extras!"
3,Packaging,"The packaging of this dvd set is rather shoddy. It is not 1/2 as nice as the previous gilmore girls sets. The box is thinner, and to cut space the plastic pages that hold the actual dvd has been made thinner, and clear. Also the binding of these pages to the box came apart within 5mins of my opening of the case; it is simply a clear sticker that connects the first disks to the last one. The last disk is the only one that is actually bound to the inner case. The show is still great but I wish they had not skimped on the packaging."
3,Gift,Great gift for my girlfriend who loved this show. Priced well and was the next season that she needed when it couldn't be found in store.
3,"Love the show, the DVD leaves alot to be desired","I love this show, don't get me wrong, but after getting great collections on DVD with plenty of commetary and other extras, this season leaves alot to be desired. Not only does it STILL not have any episode commentaries, this season doesn't even have a Gilmore Gooodies And Gossip episode like the first two seasons had. I was very disappointed. In fact, I never pay for these sets, even though I love the show, I always ask for them as gifts because I weon't spend the money on a collection with no commentary. But now to take away the fun pop-up episode too, I am very disappointed. I hope they made changes for the better for Season 4."
5,Great!,Gilmore Girls is fantastic! Each season is better than the previous one. Enjoyed both Seasons 3 and 4. They provide lots of laughs.
5,love those gilmore girls,"I recently purchased ""Gilmore girls""-Season 3 Dvd set. I also purchased seasons 1 and 2 earlier. Season 3 is GREAT, I think the show just gets better and better. I can't wait for seasons 4 and 5 on dvd. I hope the show stays on T.V. for a long time."
1,gave in to the dark side,"The show started out a little cute . . . a little annoying . . . . But by this season it totally gave into the dark side. It became another liberal propaganda show. There were lines about ""dictators who own ranches in Texas"" . . . . There were lines about how great and fabulous Hillary Clinton is . . . what a ""role model"" she is. There were episodes about how ""silly"" mothers of teenagers are who have an issue with LauraLai talking about her pregnancy to them in a school class speech. There is the entire kids sleeping and having their ""firsts"", done with casualty. There were episodes where LauraLai says ""OK Now I believe everything Bush thinks."" And of course the stream of guys floating in and out of these two women's lives and beds gets faster. It was just the decline of a show that was pretty entertaining to begin with."
4,"Very good, but needs some finetuning.","I really enjoy watching the Gilmore Girls. It's light and fun, yet deep enough to make you think about certain issues; especially those involving family; and even more specifically in the mother/daughter relationship. We see how great this relationship can be in the Lorelei/Rory pairing; and how difficult and complex in the Emily/Lorelei one.This said, I find that the show needs to finetune some elements:1. I agree with the previous reviewer who comments that no one in real life speaks so quickly. In reference to Lorelei, I would also add, no one in real life speaks with so many wordplays, pop culture, and literary references and at such speaking speeds. It's more than a bit unrealistic. I would have to agree with Luke saying that Lorelei can be obnoxious, I feel like finding her ""off"" button many times.2. I found"
2,Missing disc,Bought as a christmas present. Found out couple weeks after christmas the preson opened and started watching episodes and a disc was missing.
4,Poor packaging,Well I really enjoy Gilmore Girls and was happy to be able to buy the first 3 seasons on Amazon.com I was very disappointed when they arrived. Season three sounded broken. Thankfully when I opened it up the discs were intact but the plastic that holds all the discs together like a hinge was broken. I don't know if this is an amazon problem or a WB problem but it was disappointing all the same.
1,Dead Battery,Ad indicated it was replacement for Sanyo UF553436.This must have been very old stock. Took 36 hours to charge then got two pix before the battery died. Very dissatisfied.
1,Didn't Work,"Upon receiving this battery, I plugged it in, only to find that it didn't help turn my camera on at all."
1,Replacement battery For Fuji 450,"Battery was inexpensive and I soon found out why, will not hold a charge long when left in the camera. I got 2 of these, but I now have to fully charge both and use the camera within a couple days or the one in the camera goes completely dead, causing me to reset the time and date. Look elsewhere."
1,high self discharge,"Purchased this to replace a Fuji NP-40 for my f700. The battery charges up and is able to power the camera. But it will self discharge in (maybe even less then) a day. The original Fuji NP-40 could hold a charge a long time, at least several weeks.The self discharge rate of this Lenmar part is just to high to be acceptable. I do not recommend it."
1,"Highly defective, practically useless.","I bought this battery for my Fujifilm camera, which worked fine with my Fijifilm battery. Once I started using this battery, the camera stopped functioning properly. It would take multiple tries to actually turn the camera on - the camera would turn on and immediate shut off, and the screen would slowly fade into black, as if the camera is dying. The most annoying thing is, every time it shuts off, the date and time of the camera would reset, requiring me to fill in the date and time again and again so the photos taken would have the correct date and time. This is extremely annoying, if I were to upload the photos without the correct date and time, the order of the photos would be all messed up.Do not buy this battery. It's cheap but definitely not worth the trouble."
1,Doesn't work in my Fugifilm camera as advertised.,"It fits in the camera. But it doesn't charge. Plain old does not work at all. Too much of a hassle to send a $12 item back. Fugi was right. I should have bought the Fugi battery. Now I have to start all over again. Really 0 stars would be more appropriate, but I don't think I can do that."
2,Don't bother,"Ordered this to replace original battery in my 5 year old Pentax camera. After fully charging overnight, this battery gives roughly 25-30 photos without using a flash, or 15-20 photos using a flash. The original battery that came with the camera used to give me at LEAST double that amount. Would not recommend this battery."
5,Something Blue,"I was skeptical that Daddy's point of view would be intriguing but I was wrong. This book is greatly written, I simply couldn't put it down. Great book!"
4,Something Blue,This book is a great read that takes the readers through the journey of life. It's more than about love but also about finding one's self and learning to truly forgive others. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good funny and uplifting story.
4,JET 7110115K JWBS-14DX Bandsaw,"Received on time in perfect condition with all parts. Some difficulty with alignment of drive pulley/motor adjustment. Some cussing was required. Blade supplied was of low quality as expected. I recommend not ever installing the blade provided to avoid temporarily having a bad impression of the saw. Micro adjustable guides work well and fence is a plus. Fence back-side adjustment is a little hairy to get just right, but worth the time to allow smooth side-to-side movement of the fence. Saw runs smooth and performs as advertised. Blade tension release is very nice and helps with blade change time. Blade tension gauge is useful and readable. Hinged doors are great. Set-up instructions are well written."
5,Jet JWBS-14DX Band Saw,Great band saw. A lot of power comes out of the 1-1/4 HP motor. I needed help attaching the upper portion of the saw - HEAVY. A very solid piece of equipment. No vibration.
1,Don't get what is advertised for 6-8 months!,"Just purchased this model. When I opened up the boxes I found that the tool came with a 2"" dust collection port instead of the 4"" port as advertised. A call to Jet technical support let me know that the 4"" dust collection models will not even start to be manufacured for another 6-8 months! the first 1200 units shipped out from the factory will havr the 2"" dust collection port just like the basic 708115K model. I was told that if I wanted the 4"" dust collection port, I should get the Powermatic 14"" model that costs an additional $200.If you want the 4"" dust collection as advertised, you'll have to wait a while, or find another bandsaw."
5,Wonderful Saw,"Got my saw a couple of weeks ago. My son (age 14) and I were able to put the saw together, including installing the Riser Block, in less than two hours. In another 30 minutes the saw was pretty well tuned and we were cutting boards!The saw appears to be very well made. It is solid, and has almost no vibration when running. It is also very quiet, which was a pleasant surprise. The quick-release blade tensioner is also a VERY welcome addition.We have been working on a number of small projects as well as playing around with resawing and some thicker hardwoods. The saw has never bogged down or hesitated (as long as the feed rate is reasonable). The 1 1/4 hp motor is adequate for all that I have tried to do.The only suggestion I have is to invest in high-quality blades - the Timberwolf blades make a HUGE difference when resawing."
4,Jet 710115K Bandsaw,"Purchased the bandsaw based upon reviews I had read here and on other sites. So far am pleased with the tool, but have not used it to any large degree. But test cuts have been accurate, and smooth in operation.Assembly was easy overall. Only real problem is with adjusting the tension on the belt since the nuts on the motor are in the most awkward place and two are hard to reach.Only real complaint was the table, based upon another reviewers comment about the table, it was the first thing I checked, and sure enough it was not level over all the surface. It had about a 6 inch wide concave spot near the blade with the deepest part about 1/8 inch. Called Jet and no problem, they are shipping another table, hope it is completely level. Am happy with customer response to a problem."
3,Pop Tart,"Having 'Chuckies in Love' on the car radio back in the day I have to admit I can live without hearing it again. As for Pop Pop I have to hear it again..and again. It's just as sweet and tart as a Pop Tart. Sometimes the vocals are delivered so cutesy and adorable that I get chills of delight. This mature pop music singer doing some Jazz standards and not blowing it is delightful. Go ahead buy/download Pop Pop, it's a keeper - but if you don't dig it your mommy probably will. Rating: Content **** audio quality ****"
1,Green Fuzzy Jerky,"After paying extra to send this item to a South Pacific Island, I was a bit disappointed that it was inedible.Due to defective heat sealing half the jerky in the package was green and fuzzy.Waiting for a reply regarding the refund which requires the package be shipped back 3,000 miles"
2,Too Salty,"This jerky is way too salty and not at all spicy. However, the jerky is more tender than Jack Links if that is important to you. Personally, I like a little bit more chewiness in my jerky."
1,Run screaming from this CD!,"Halloween soundtracks should be fun, chilling and maybe a little campy - like the soundtrack to and old Universal monster movie. This CD had too many sounds of children and babies in distress. That's not fun, that's unnerving."
4,Versatile!,"My fireplace is small! Candles were too high up so I took the hacksaw and cut the feet off the tallest ones. It still stands due to the accordion design (yay).Also, like another review said, candles are hard to put on. I used a drill to make the holes first..much better!Thirdly, added glass bead/blobs on top of some foil and my unsafe fireplace is a joy!"
5,This Is A Must Have for those Interested in Second Wave Feminism,"Red Stockings was one of the first Radical Feminist groups in the United States. It includes several articles by Kathie Sarachild including ""The Power of History"".This collection is important as a primary source. It does need placing within context as many of the articles were written before the Lavender Menace faction force open and honest discussions regarding lesbian issues.Susan Brownmiller and Ruth Rosen's movement memoirs describing the development of Second Wave Feminism add context and place this most valuable resource within the developmental time line."
2,loose fitting plunge collar,"Great reviews, but I found the clamp holding the base to the motor to be very poor, It allows slop, and angles the base from the motor. There are much better units available."
4,Router w/ a light,I had read some of the reviews and had no problem with the router slipping in it's casing changing the router depth but when I mounted it to my router table the light which is very handy kept coming on even when I wasn't using it just plugged in. I sent it back for a new one and that router seems to be working OK
3,Good Router,"Good Router And Multifunction is Nice, But Takes To Long To Switch Between Plunge And Fixed, And It's Heavy, Much Heavier Than My Old One That Burned Up After 15 yrs. Does Work Well, Just Be Steady The Weight Makes It Easy To Tilt While Working."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"I strongly urge you NOT to buy this product. I have used it one time and am taking it back to the store tomorrow. It is very poorly made. It has 2 built-in, white LEDs to shine on your workpiece. They are very nice, but they do not stay on. They flicker on and off. Also, the bases are very poorly-made cast aluminum. The one had a huge grinding in it so the motor could fit on it. Also, the plunge base sticks, meaning that, as you want to come up from your workpiece, you have to lift the whole router off. That doesn't sound like a problem, but when you're 1/16"" off the wood and the springs decide to work, you mar your workpiece. Also, the plastic body is very flimsy and won't take long to break. Spend the extra $50 to $100 and get yourself something good that's made in America. I'm going to buy the Milwaukee."
1,burned out 4th time,less than 6 months old and the motor is burned out and its past the warranty of only 90 days. seems like a rather short time or they expect this to happen. very disappointed.
1,"nice features, doesn't work, sucky customer service","The features looked great on this, and the price is obviously right. So I bought it, but it didn't work out of the box (depth adjustment on the fixed base was frozen up and wouldn't work). I called Skil and the only options they offered me were (1) to deal with the store where I bought it or (2) to send in the base (at my cost) to their regional service center for them to repair it.Now, I don't know about you, but I expect manufacturers of power tools (particularly Bosch, which owns Skil) to stand behind their products, and this doesn't qualify! After just paying to buy a brand new router, I'm sure not going to shell out even more bucks to get it repaired! Now I'll see if the store where I bought it can help me out...I may give the Skil one more shot, but I hope I don't end up with another dud."
2,Don't waste your money on this pamphlet,"This pamphlet is full of material pulled from the internet. The diagrams are hard to read because of small print, and it only provides basic information. I recomend this pamplet to people who lost their owners manual or don't have access to the internet. I'm sure their are better manuals out there for the hi power. The search continues. I would have givin this one star but because it's printed in english I give it two."
3,"Browning High Power Assembly, Disassembly","It does not go deep enough in depth. I was looking at getting a book on complete disassembly to bare frame, and this just covers what the owners manual covers, field strip and reassembly."
4,Chinese Cuisine Taiwanese Style,"This book is both beautifully illustrated and well detailed. Each recipe is accompanied by a color photograph of the finished dish.The recipes are easy to follow, and the ingredients can be found in your local supermarket or in an Asian speciality food store. Recipes range anywhere from seafood to meat to soup dishes. Taiwanese cooking is light in nature with a large emphasis on the use of vegetables. This book will appeal to home cooks who enjoy preparing chinese dishes."
3,Only for diehard Algonks,"Written by the son of founding Algonquin Round Table members Heywood Broun and Ruth Hale.Heywood Jr parents led a mildly alternative, artistic life focused on their work and other pursuits and not centered on the family unit. Well written, he's obviously quite bright but it's somewhat hard to read due to the overall tone of loneliness he focuses on.Luckily he seemed to find some success in life altho he doesn't get into it here. He was also a commentator for NPR amongst other things.There are some nice little bits about lesser known Algonquin fringe members such as Paul Robeson who he writes glowingly of and so on. This book would only be of interest to those who really want to know more about Heywood Broun and Ruth Hale, but be warned it focuses on their weaknesses."
4,Good cream,I have only used this cream once however I could definitely tell a difference in the performance of my bearing. They do seem smoother.
2,Not worth the hype!,"If you are using WD-40 (which is NOT RECOMMENDED by the way)... then this is a much better alternative. Unfortunately I was not impressed at all. It is a decent lube if you need something in a pinch I guess, but there are far-superior products on the market that cost much less and you get much more. Best bang for your well earned dollar would be a teflon-based or teflon-infused lubricant (if you are fortunate enough to find one). Just because something is designed for a specific use, does not mean there aren't better products available. Fair warning."
5,bones speedcream,Good product works better than any other product I have tried. I down hill and free ride so speed is important to me and this product provides that. Arrived in timely fashion and in good condition. Would also reccomend bones bearing cleaning bottle sold seperately.
4,Bones Speed Cream.,I'll keep this short and simple. It's a great lubricant to put in your bearings after cleaning them in solution. 4/5 stars because it is a bit pricey but seems like the small bottle will last a long time anyways.
5,Bones Speed Cream,Bones Speed Cream use this to lube your Bones Bearings or any other bearings you might have great product.use this after cleaning my bearings for a longer smoother roll.protects the bearings from rust.another all around great product from the Bones camp.
5,Awesome!,"This is a definite must for any one person who skates. Great product, we love it. So much cheaper then, purchasing at the rink."
5,Keep your bearings running smoooooooth,"Great friggin' formula, if you want to keep your bearings in mint shape, get the bottle washer, and after you're done washing them, just place a drop or two inside the bearings, and you're all set, no need to make a mess with spray on lubs, and helps your bearings spin smooth like new! Sk8 or die!"
4,Good Product,The Product is good but the shipping was not as fast as i would like but overall the seller was good and delivered the original product. Will buy again if needed.
5,Amazing Product for a Low Price,"The product came in smaller than I thought it would but that's fine because You only need one or two drops for each bearing. I'm sure this bottle will last me a long time. When I cleaned my bearings, they spun pretty loud but then I add a drop of this in it and it becomes silent. It does slow down a little bit but you just gotta spin it a lot to make it evenly spread out. I did have some minor issues with getting 100% of the drop into the bearing as some gets on the side of the bearing. I'm sure it's just me being sloppy but I'll try to figure out how to drop the cream better next time. This is just me not wanting to waste even a tiny 1% of the drop so don't let this not make you want to buy it. It really is a great product as it makes my bearings run smooth and quiet. Highly recommended product."
5,Excellent stuff,"I do roller derby and skate on some pretty dirty surfaces...gotta keep the old bearings clean and speedy! This is excellent lubricant, I use it every cleaning on my Bonez Redz."
2,Good resource for real beginners,"I bought this for my niece who has started sax lessons; but sadly, she has been at them for nearly a year so she is already well beyond the level of this DVD. It's a good resource for a true, true beginner, but not for someone with a basic mastery/understanding of the alto sax."
4,Eclectic South Beach Sytle,"Showy, stylish, and highly individualistic: the essence of South Beach style and this photo book captures the spirit of SoBe! The photos and explanatory text do not emphasis the ubiquitous Art Deco architecture, but rather blends its influences with a mixture of Mediterranean styles and the eclectic, over-the-top zaniness that is South Beach. I just bought a condo in South Beach, and I am currently immersing myself in the art and social history of South Beach, and photographer Steven Brooke captures a part of South Beach that is the reason I am attracted and in love with this place. A must have book for South Beach culture aficionados. I also recommend Deco Delights, which places greater emphasis on the Art Deco architecture of South Beach."
4,Lots of Family fun,"For any family even those who have not seen the movie, it isn't your usual life with familys and cars and college payments but it keeps everyone laughing and enjoying themselves. I would recommend it."
3,"Loved the Cover, Inside Not as good","I bought this game with the expectation that it would be as fun as I remebered when playing it as a child. The cover of the box really drew me in... my daughter loves pirates of the Caribbean.The game board is not as exciting as the box graphics, and the spinner does not stay seated in it's spot, when you try to spin.If I had to do it over again, I would buy the original game of life. Much more interesting!"
4,"It's a board game, so you know what you're getting.","I got this for my girlfriend b/c she's obsessed w/ Pirates. I never played it, but she did with her family, and they enjoyed it. It's still Life, so don't expect to be shocked out of your trousers by it, but it's a nice twist on an old classic."
4,A fun twist on a classic game,"I bought this game as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old nephew who loves the ""Pirates"" movies. He couldn't wait to play it on Christmas Day! Six of us played and it had the familiar feel of the old ""Life"" game with some fun twists to make it a Pirate's Life. I was a bit simpler in concept, but no less fun. The only criticism I have is that the spinner wheel kept falling off the pin it's balanced on. I was the only one who could seem to spin it without it coming apart. Based on the movie, it could easily have been played with dice, but because it's a ""Life"" version, I guess that's why they used the spinner."
2,too complicated for the younger ones,"We own just about every board game we can get our hands on, and my daughter (9) is a huge fan of Pirates of the Carribean. There was a life game that was themed Pirates (I think based on the first movie) only sold at Disneyland, but we had to pass it up ($[...]!!), so when we saw this one, we bought it on the spot. The concept of the game is similar to Life the original, which I loved as a kid. However, there are some elements that are WAY more complicated such as battleing with ships and the ending. If she and I play together, its fine, but when she attempts to play with friends, it gets confusing for them. This is perhaps a better game for kids over ten. We'll put it up for a few years and give it another try."
5,fun game,"This game is fun for a family night. It is the game of ""Life"" with a different spin on it. We play with 6 people and our boys like the idea that you can steal the best ship from other players. A really fun game."
4,Good ideas,"The game is fun, but way too complicated. I will put it away for a while until my daugter is a little older (she is now 7 1/2), not much fun for her since she has no idea what is going on since mom can hardly figure it out. All in all a good concept and could be enjoyable with older children."
5,Peter Spier - need I say more?,"If you don't know Peter Spier's books, then run, don't walk (or order on Amazon) and get some of his books. They have the more beautiful, most detailed illustrations and you could look at it for hours. It fills your imagination with all kinds of ideas. As a teacher, I have done whole lessons based on his books - check them out. Noah's Ark helps you understand the possibilities."
5,great book!,"This book was purchased for our grandchildren. I chose it because the book had been a family favorite when our children were young. Because the book is basically without words, our children learned to tell the story themselves. Even very young children can recall the story as they turn the pages. As the children get older, the book still captures their interest with incredible detail in the drawings on each page."
2,And so it began...again,"Do YOU know the story?Peter Spier uses rhyme to name all of the creatures that went aboard Noah's ark. This takes place on the first page of the story. The remaining pages ""tell"" the story in illustration only. Although the illustration is wonderfully detailed, if the reader is not familiar with the story, they may get lost in the translation."
5,Great Stripe,"I make cutomized corn hole boards and use this tape for stripping. Works GREAT! To assist with the bonding to the wood, I suggest after setting it up, use a blow dryer and heat the tape to cause it to bond with the wood. Quality product. Been using for about a year and have had no complaints from customers."
1,Buyer Beware,"For those who are new to computers (or just buying cables): This coupler does not work with all Cat5e cables, only RJ45 cables. It would have been nice if the product description said ""ONLY works with RJ45 cables."" I have two 50' Cat5e Patch cables also made by Belkin and a 6' Trisonic networking cable and the coupler does NOT work with ANY of them. The back of the package says ""the use of a coupler in a network environment is not Cat5e certified. For 100Base-T Ethernet Cat5e applications use Belkin R6G050."" Whatever that means - since none of my cables say 100Base-T on them either. The price was so low it's not even worth trying to return it (assuming they would take it back since I opened the package). So, anyway, if you don't have a cable that actually has RJ45 on it, do NOT buy this."
1,This is available in every Dollar store,I am surprised people actually paying $6 or more for something that you can buy for $1 at any Dollar shop. Another thought is why buy an extender when you can buy a 50 feet cable for $10. Extender leaks the signal and can add interference. I was looking for this as a filler under $1 to reach $25 (for free shipping).
2,Could have been a TV episode,This obscure and bizzare film had much promise...but it was much too long...dragged out...boring at points. It could have been a 60-minute TV episode (with commercials) and may have been a hit. The premise and storyline was intriguing...but there were way too many sequences with cliche'-filled dialogue. Good try.
2,Waste of money,"The story line wasn't bad, but the movie itself was a tad boring and difficult to watch, wouldn't recommend this movie and prob won't watch it again. You get what you pay for with this film."
4,Very good.,Very good. Not quite as much action and mystery . More psychological suspense and leans closer to reality than many serial movies.
1,Poor filmmaking,"The person who made this film either was an idiot or thought that his audience was idiots. There are a bunch of mysteries in this film and every time that a key hint in the mystery shows up, the director decides that we shouldn't see it. The murdered body, the message under the rug, the e-mail on the computer screen, the details of the videotape, etc.. It's like the moron who made this thought that he could make the mystery more mysterious by not sharing any of the clues with us. I find that deeply frustrating and aggravating. Not only do I not recommend this film - I think it should cease to exist and I want my money back."
2,Bad Story,"We've all seen this story done before, and we've all seen it done much better. There are too many stereotyped characters, including the lead. The dialogue is all cliches.It doesn't make sense, either. How old are some of the characters supposed to be? We see one of them in flashbacks taking place in the 1950s, where he looks like he's about 13 or 14 years old (and why does he have long hair in these flashbacks? Boys did not wear their hair long at that time). We also see footage of him in the 1960s when he's a young man. Then, 30 years later in the late 1990s, he looks like he's about 40."
5,what has a black gay 'has-been' actor to do?,I giggled with glee all throughout the almost 3 hours! Not a dull moment on this DVD! The Actor/Director/Writer is black and on the wrong side of 30 probably even forty-ish! So what do you do - Well write your own ticket! And boy did he let it RIP! A show that Redefines the family unit. It's also meant to show us that it's stupid to ASSUME (people's sexuality)! And to LIGHTEN up it's just SEX! ONe of the casting coup was the Asian lesbian who happens to be on children's television as one of the TELETUBBIES! GET THIS DVD!
3,Average At Best,"This really isn't what you would consider a metal album, more of a post-hardcore album. Don't worry though, this isn't the fashion-laden plague that has been marketed well. Think more like Haste, Snapcase, Poison The Well, and Skycamefalling.Okay, now to the album. This has some catchy melodies, but the vocals can be quite annoying at times. Overall, if you want something catchy and fun, I'd recommend this. Note that it's not something that's complex and saturated with talent."
5,You have to listen to this album,"This album totally rocks!You have to listen to this album.It's amazing, you'll want to listen to it over and over again.It's that good."
2,Exchanged it,"I was really hyped about this cd. I had heard end of august and loved it. And i thought the heart and the shape was even better. But after these 2 tracks the cd just goes down hill. I kept re-playing it thinking hey this songs gonna be good, oh well the next one will. But no, the cd came to an end and i was left dissapointed. I took the cd back the next day. Hey normally id've kept it to give it a chance to grow on me but i knew it wouldent this time. Anyway heres two stars for the first two tracks. Save your money for something else"
3,????? 3.5 stars,"I will tell you this is a good album, however don't expect the rawness of the debut CD. The fella's went a little more melodic on the majority of this record, which isn't always a bad thing. I really feel this CD lacks the energy of the first one, but it's not bad by any means. Definitly worth the money"
5,OMG.,"This is by far the best album i've heard in 2004. These guys really stepped it up since their debut album. On a similar level of comparison as when hearing Chimaira's 'Impossibility..."" album for the first time. It will be hard for any band this year to put out an album that can compete with this one. Best tracks IMO are: The Heart and the Shape, Destroy the Map, Cure Eclipse, and Installing the Catheter. Go buy this now this is seriously some amazing music."
1,THIS ISNT METAL,"This is 100 % emo trite. Vapid at best, let this band sink into the pit of forgotten music."
4,just ok,"Don't remember this book being anything special, needed it for a college course & amazon always has great prices. I was a few years younger than, but it wasn't anything special to me, it bored me & I did not look forward to reading from it. Hard to keep my attn."
3,Community and Public Health Nursing,I would have liked to have received the book faster because it is a TEXTBOOK. It took almost 3 weeks and my class was 1/2 over.
5,Fifty Words About A WORD OR TWO,"It was my privilege to work with Christopher Andreae editing this new collection of essays, and therefore I can wholeheartedly personally guarantee that his work is delightful and thought-provoking. With his amazing command of the English language, he gives readers unique insight as he describes his experiences through the years."
4,"No, it's not new material.",For the person asking. This is an affordable fairly large color reproduction of a story McCay told over consecutive weeks in newspapers during the turn of the century. Sometimes McCay would draw stand alone pages. Sometimes Little Nemo would dream a connected story over weeks - but of course he would always wake up at the end of exch strip. This is one of those. The book uses original collected color newspapers from the turn of the 1900s so the quality isn't perfect though it's still very impessive. You don't need this if you are going to get the complete collections but the cost is low and it's a perfect way to see if you enjoy this work by catching a continuing story from a high point in quality and imagination.
3,Love the book and I love the band! (Good Charlotte),"If you love the band honestly you need to buy the book.I have never read it though, but I'd buy the book fora little Good Charlotte fan worship thingy. Then, I'd go to a concert and ask them to sign it for me. Read the book andlisten to the music! Remember, If you love Good Charlottehonestly buy the book!"
3,Good book,The reason i read this book is because my favorite band good charlotte named themselves after it so i was looking things up and i read this book cuz i was bored..and it's pretty good..Good charlotte the band rocks too! i've loved them since 2000..anyways the book Good Charlotte is not as good as the band but still kinda good
2,good charlotte the band,"i haven't read the book.. i just wanted to say that to all you good charlotte [the band] lovers like me, they don't particularly like this book... they just thought it was a good band name."
5,THE GREATEST GAME!,Taboo is the most fun! My only complaint is I wish they'd make new cards and sell them separately.
5,Delightful!,This is for adults and teens. Fabulous fun. A workout for the brain that always leaves us laughing. Delightful source of entertainment for friends and family. Makes good memories as we laugh and retell certain moments again and again.
4,Great game but goes by quickly,"This is an awesome party game! Even if you have less than four people, you can manage to have fun with a few adjustments. The problem with these kind of games are that words get used up fast. However, it is a very fun and challenging game. You'll have to find something else to do after a while though...."
3,very worn!,"This Taboo game came with a corroded battery connections making the timer unable to work, very battered box, wrinkled score sheets. I kept it because I needed it for a party the next day, but this game should not have been sold at that price. Shameful. Barbara"
5,Addictive..addictive...addictive!!,"How else could I describe this? Addictive! Lol...Definitely a game you want to include in your party gatherings or family game nights. This is especially fun when there are both males and females involved (think, battle of the sexes, ha!) and the more people the merrier!Definitely recommend; it is worth your money!!!"
5,Amazing Game,"I have recently bought this game, and played it with a group for the first time last week.. I can't describe how much fun we had that night because of this game, I'm so glad I got it.. HIGHLY recommend it!"
5,Excellent and Fun,Perfect expecially those who have a learning disability such as language development. Helps strengthen those vocabulary discription skills.
5,great,Bought this as a gift. My husband says he loves this - he's very happy with all of it. Would order again for friends and relatives.
3,Not for serious Pavarotti fans,"Funny graphic editing made this a jumble of nothing.Not a proper concert, not a proper documentary.NOT recommended!"
1,Don't buy,"Miss led information was not the length it said in the add, plugged hose in and 2 seams busted immediately. The hode was turned on slowly. Maybe the one they showed when I ordered would have wored but the one they sent was much smaller and we didn't get any use out of it at all. Kid's threw it away it was suppose to be their Easter day activity. HUH!!!!!"
3,Whatever my granddaughter wants,"We ordered this for a birthday party and it served well, much shorter than the previous one we owned but needed it on short notice and she was happy so that's all that matters!"
1,False advertising,"Online this product is described as 20'. When you receive it, it is 15'. Big difference, and falsly advertised on the website. I won't be so quick to order something like this again."
2,Aqua blast Dual racing slide,"I bought this for my 2 kids thinking it would be fun to both slide to the end together. I thought it was going to be bigger and longer than it was. Too small, too short for older kids. Ok for cooling off but not as much fun as other slides we have tried!"
3,Racing Slide Hard to set up but good fun,"Found the product hard to set up and even skimped on some of the directions because they were too time consuming. Also you need a very level surface to enjoy this product. However, it is lots of fun for the little ones once set up and in a good spot!"
4,It Won't Make You A Lot Of Money ...,"But it might help you keep what you have now ... The programs are simple, easy to run programs. Most can be done on a hand held calculator - once you find and figure out the formula. Good loan/banking reference formulas."
4,no news,"If you have the earlier release of this set (1992 I think), there's really no need to replace it. This current (2004) release was supposedly remastered, but I can hear little if any difference. Amazon shows both versions, but I'd bet the earlier one may well be out of print. You get all the Caballe trademarks here: floated pianissimos, gorgeous mid-range singing - and the usual glottal stops. Even if you're not a big MC fan, the set is worth getting for all those arias you're not likely to hear elsewhere, or done as well."
1,y-y-yawwwn!,This music i cannot hear it is boring unlike cage or stockhausen or ligeti ok? My parents are entrepeneurs musicales bassoon and dulcimersoh i'm jeannette i am 6
1,Technically Brilliant...,"David Arden is a world class musician from San Diego, California. His keyboard mastery is evident throughout the entire CD. Arden's choice to record Berio compositions, however, is unfortunate."
4,Fun but not everything as advertised,The toys are well made but they are 10 shot rubberband guns not 12 shot.
2,does not work,"installation was easy. sound works for the audio. but that was it. radio controls don't work, and after trying every possible dip switch combination, it malfunctioned, and steering wheel controls do not work. very disappointed. and i would like to know where they come up with that price... its a matchbox sized micro controller that hacks into the stereo system and fools it into thinking it has a cdc or sat hookup. i would say it should be more like 20 dollars. not 100-200. the only thing that does work it the basic audio connection and ipod charging.nothing else seemed to work."
3,Sometimes Tricky to Work,"I found installation super easy. When you hook up the iPod, the stereo should be off, hook up the iPod, give it a few seconds to jump through startup, then press CD until CDCH (CD changer) displays. There were days when I couldn't get the CD changer to display, and had to use my tape deck adapter. The best part is that it always uses the same volume, dispite the volume level displayed on the iPod. Before shutting the car off, you must turn off the stereo, otherwise the iPod will keep playing and charging off the car battery. The aux and the iPod cannot be played simultaneously, so a GPS and iPod cannot both be played with this product."
5,lg,I have used this product for years and nothing else compares. Where can I find it??? Do they not make it anymore? Do not like te Pacquin w/Aloe becaue it is too greasy....
2,For the VERY Beginner,"I am definitely new to this art but even I thought this was a little too basic. Most of the information covered in this 25 minute video can be read in the first few pages of a beginning scrapbook magazine or book. I also didn't love the layouts that they showed as examples. None of them were visually exciting to me.I would recommend renting this from a library if you have never heard of scrapbooking before. Otherwise, it's too basic to watch more than once."
4,Intro to Scrapbooking,"This DVD gives the beginner 25 minutes of advice, so it sticks to the very basic scrapbooking techniques. Even after reading a number of books on the topic, this can help a novice feel a little more confident getting started.It explains what basic tools you need, the importance of acid free paper and pens, and gives a few photography tips. It touches briefly on sorting your pictures, cropping photos and goes into more detail on laying out the page. Seeing how easily the demonstrator matted the photos and what considerations to make for color combinations was reassuring. It also talks about journaling using who/what/where/when/why to get the info onto the page.It's pretty basic, but if you are a beginner, maybe that's what you need."
3,"Good, but lost what made the band unique","This is the scond album from The Toll on Geffen. Their first, ""Price of Progression"" was fantastic, featuring a number of 8+ minute epic songs. The first album had a lot of spoken word parts to songs as well. ""Stick & Stones"" has none of that. Not that it's bad, it just seems like the record company told them to lose all of the aspects that made them unique. The songs are still very good basic rock with excellent, thought-provoking lyrics, but the heart of the thing was gone.The fact that ""Price of Progression"" is selling for $75 used, but ""Sticks and Stones"" is selling for a penny, should tell you something."
4,Damn good!,"This is a great cd, and the best song is ""Nobody knows"". It's a great song to belt out and dance around to! Even my 5 yr. old nephew loves it!"
1,Buy Disney,I do not know why there are two versions of this movie but I can say this is not the one to buy. I bought and returned two of this version. Both paused in the middle of the movie and would not finish no matter how I tried to skip to the next scene. I then bought a Disney one and it played perfectly. PLEASE buy the Disney version and save yourself a lot of frustration.
5,awesome fun,"in the day of filthy language and graphic scenes, this movie is totally refreshing. i have all the air bud movies as well as the air buddies and watch them over and over again. my grandkids love them. some might think that there are scenes in this and the other air bud movies are a bit silly, but then if i want total reality, i will read the newspaper or watch the news. they are all the story of good vs evil and good triumphs. for some good, clean fun, enjoy."
4,GREAT PRODUCT -- SMALL FLAW,"I recently purchased a Hitachi Universal Workstation which is actually the TracRac T3 in Hitachi clothing. I used it to trim out a new house, cutting hundreds of feet of trim and moulding. It works great and is very sturdy...except a part known as a ""end cap"" -- a piece of brittle plastic used as a stop for the telescoping arms. The first one broke in my bare hands -- which I thought must be a fluke, the second broke the first time the extension arm reached the stop.It has taken me awhile just to figure out that the Hitachi I bought is actually the TracRac -- so I am going to give their customer service a chance, otherwise this would be a 5 star review.I really like how easy it easy to remove the saw from the stand and to fold up and store the stand."
5,"best miter stand on the market,if it had a handle","Bought this online from amazon, love that free shipping! i purchased the t3b for my craftsman 12"" slider! its quite a beast,but this tracrac handles it and then some! in the manual they list mostly bosch,dewalt ,hitachi as the preffered saws for compatibility,but my craftsman set up nice and easy! i think this stand will accommodate just about any saw,ingenious in its mounting attachment! if there were to be a complaint,she needs a handle for transporting,other than that,its love at first sight,enjoy,,,,john w."
4,workstation,Workstation is awesome but the directions how to put together is not easy to understand recommend go to TracRac site and download directions much betterand easier to understand
3,Well designed,"Under a 12"" DeWalt, the spread of the saw supports is about 23"", too wide to use the stretcher between the supports. This is a heavy saw and the third support piece would have been nice. Very steady, well made.I had a 3-Star Rating initially, but that was only due to the delay in shipping (from a 1/15/07 order date to the delivery date of 4/30/07. I'd give it a 4-Star rating now that it's here and assembled."
2,Worst of MacKay's Books,"Don't get me wrong. I love Harvey MacKay. I think all of his books (except this one) are phenomenal. this book might have been cutting edge when it was first written but those who are highly knowledgeable about job search strategies in this day and age will agree it just doesn't keep up with the times in being relevant for use today in 2003. It is eerie how the economy back then mirrors how it is now. There's some great Job search & Career books out there, Harvey's just isn't one of them. This is the only MacKay book I've given less than 4 stars. Maybe that's why it's no longer in print?"
2,Its OKAY,"I dont praticularly care for this chapstick. I dont find that it makes my lips looks shiny at all. And I feel like it wears of quickly, without my lips feeling moisturized. The only plus I really have is that it smells good."
1,would rate with negative stars if possible,This is the absolute worst excuse for lip balm ever. It may glide on smoothly but does not last at all. In reality my lips are worse while using it. Do not waste your $$$$
4,another Blistex product I'm addicted to!,"I'm a big fan of Blistex DCT and Lip medex, both of which come in those little tub things, but I was looking for something a little more convenient (you can't dip your finger into a little jar when you have long fingernails), so that's my first compliment to this new Blistex product - it's user friendly. :)As for how it performs, well... it's name is very appropriate.. this product keeps your lips silky and shiney. However, if you are suffering from serious winter-lips (ie. dry and cracked, and needing extra help), then you should try the Lip Medex. Otherwise, this is proving to be a great day-to-day Blistex product."
1,it was a mistake,"I agree with rufus! This one sucks. Bought it from wal-mart b/c i'd left my gloss at home, i expected some shine, maybe even a little moisture... it goes on smooth, sure but when you rub your lips together, it won't feel smooth, it has a dry cheap vibe. Great packaging but it's a hoax.The shine is unique though, makes the lips glimmer like they're covered in thousands of microscopic pieces of glitter and thAt might have a nice appeal to some and hey, it serves it's purpose, i suppose, but I'd rather buy a cheap lip gloss. At least they make the lips shiny without severely chapping the lips in the process.Buy one from a local store before investing in 12."
5,Great theatre and a great DVD production.,"As riviting on film as it was in the theatre. David Drake can, in the blink of an eye take you from a humorous moment deep into thought and retrospect. A great plus of this DVD are the two older endings that suscintly show how our lives have been changed since the beginning of this piece to the 1990's Off Broadway production and to this more current version.This piece was written as a message of hope and it certainly delivers. Thanks, David."
2,Not good for people with allergies,"My daughter tried this product and her eyes got swollen. Since I have fewer problems with allergies than she does, I used it and it looked beautiful the first three days... My eyelashes started falling after that... I should probably try a hypoallergenic version (if there are any available)."
3,Clumps,"My eyelashes clumped before this even touched them.I have very long lashes, but not many of them. There are just not enough bristles to force my lashes apart like other brands do. The bristles are very short too. Brands that I swear by usually seem to have very long bristles.Hope this helps for people with my style lashes.Other than that, the mascara lasts long and does not run. Pretty easy to take off using an oil free cleanser."
4,Belkin Two-Way Phone Jack's a Fine Product,This Belkin Jack Modular T Adapter was a perfect replacement to my old two-way phone jack which was already breaking apart and no longer functioning. It's perfectly compatible with my AT&T Cordless telephone and I haven't had any problems with it since I bought it two months ago. This two-way phone jack is a fine product. It's cheap and easy to install.
4,It works,"I ordered this at the request of my husband. All I can say is it works, so we are happy with it. It did take a little longer to arrive than our Amazon orders typically do though."
1,Not good enough for safety,"I bought this to stripe up a black briefcase so that I could have more visibility at night. This tape is just not visible enough to rely on for safety. It's degree of retroreflection is quite low (I could not find one specified), and the seller notes on other black tapes like this that black is the least reflective color. Only under the very best of conditions (shining a flashlight at just the right angle) did the product show any significant amount of retrofelction. This product reflects a pinkish-orange and is not highly visible. I would give it no stars, but that is not possible. I ended up trashing this product and buying a similar but much more retroreflective product (3M Scotchlite 680-85) elsewhere."
2,Exhausting attempts at literary majesty,The opening chapter of the book resulted in my being determind to battle through Ms Forbes confusing and exhausting attempts to cover a range of subjects which demand that the reader expends as much energy on following the plot as the heroine does in her pursuit of the truth. At times the temptation to admit defeat loomed large but the need to know where the book would end was greater. Frustration is not always an emotion which leads one to complete a task but in the case of Bombay Ice it is worth overcoming. Hopefully the next novel from the author will focus less on attempts of literary majesty and more on the telling of the story.
3,"Too ambitious, confusing, but tantalizing first novel","This is one gritty book! Gritty contents, gritty heroine. It makes one wonder what the author herself is like. The basic story is about a freelance investigative crime reporter who doggedly does her thing in Bombay, focusing on ""Bollywood,"" the Indian movie industry, and on a series of deaths among the city's ""hijra""-- surgically altered male to female prostitutes. Various characters--many are brutally tortured--die, and Roz, our heroine, pursues the truth relentlessly, all the while musing about her own screwed up family background, about chaos theory, about meteorology and any number of other esoteric subjects. I found the plot confusing, but the picture of Bombay, and the importance of the monsoon to the city, fascinating and it's what kept me going. I'll look forward to another novel by Leslie Forbes and hope she smooths out her plotting in that one."
2,overly complex,"The varied and multiple themes of this novel lost my attention. The descriptions of India were interesting, and kept me going past the first chapters, but ultimately, it wasn't enough to hold my interest."
2,Another cliched overglamorized view of India,I'm was sorry John Irving ever went to Goa and Bombay to write Son of the Circus. I'm more sorry that Leslie Forbes wrote this book. It seems to me that westerners fascinated with Eastern culture seek desperately to lionize or demonize it and Leslie is guilty of both. Another childish exploration of foreign lands done with little finesse.
2,Pretentious tosh,"A highly confusing book with the silliest heroine I have come across in ages. However, the depictions of Bombay's underworld life and India itself are fascinating, if perhaps not exactly true to life. However, they were the only reason I finished this book at all!! Forbes has been over-ambitious and shows off her knowledge too much. And yes, I really hated the heroine, Roz!!"
1,Ice this book,"I am surprised this book found a publisher. It is rambling and does not seem to be heading anywhere. The principal character, Roz, is rude, obnocsious, and quite an unbearable person. I would hate to come across someone like her in real life."
4,Vita Bath worth the $,I have always used this bubble bath and never get the dreaded ring around the bathtub. A little goes a long way so it's no more expensive than drugstore products.
5,Nice,This has a fresh smell that isn't overpowering and seems to help with skin that tends to be on the dry side.
4,Reconnecting with an old friend,"I love vitabath and the smell takes me back to younger times.We live at high altitude (5400 ft) and when the boxes arrived, the soap had leaked out. I smelled this as soon as I picked up the package.I wish Vitabath made a lotion."
5,refreshing,Wonderful bath experience. Refreshing and delightful. Feels good on the skin. Not drying especially since I am a Senior. Leaves a wonderful aroma in the bath room as well as on your skin. Can us sparingly and produces wonderful lather.Does not loose its feel throughout the Bath. The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming as often scented soaps/gelees are.Glad I found it. Thanks Amazon for your choices.Bernardine
5,satisfied with purchase,"The item was a gift for someone who likes Vitabath. I'm very pleased with the purchase for two reasons.It's not available in stores any longer, and it was a great price. I bought the Vitabath through Amazon.com."
4,Love Yourself . . . .,". . .When we use this emerald 'goo'(gel) . . it always gave us the feeling, - that we actually love our physical-body, and - it gave us the idea , that we are indeed i m p o r t a n t.It is worth the weight in emerald.ENJOY, - ENJOY, - ENJOY(... we have nothing to do with the producers of this product. (For sure)"
2,Have heard of Vitabath but had never tried it,"After reading the reviews for Vitabath, I was looking forward to trying something moisturizing. I thought this contained Vitamin D but it seems to have been reformulated from what was described online. Anyway, I'm sure it's a great product but I didn't even try it after smelling it. I didn't think it was very ""green"" to try to return it so I will give it to someone else to try. If you're sensitive to strong scents, this may not be for you. The shipping was fast."
5,Last Train,"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thompson at Alcatraz my senior year in high school. After my tour I stopped and visited the gift shop where he had a small table set up to sign his book. He was very quiet and friendly. He was not interested in talking about his time at Alcatraz with just anyone. However, that was okay because his book gives a detailed account of the life up to and in Alcatraz. I thanked him for signing my book and shook his hand. Later after I finished reading the book I realized I met a completely different man. Definitely a changed man. For only having a 6th grade education the book was put together very well. I would recommend it without a doubt!"
3,Good as a primary source but poorly written,"From the Forward:Whitey dpent his four years on the Alcatraz in the same anonnimity as most of the hundreds of other convicts who lived on the rock. He was neither a ""public enemy"" in the Holloywood sense nor a punk kid new to prison life.=================================This book is at best reambeling and tough to follow and at worst tottly confusing. However, there are few enough first person accounts of life on that rock so this is a vlaubale source for people doing work on the famous prison.I think that Whitey's skills as a communicator have greatly improved since this was written and his presentation on TV untervews shows that ""Last Train"" could have been more enjoyable to to read with a little more work."
4,Fiona's Last Words...,"Sorry to say this was fiona's last release! I love all her stuff,but I must admit that Her 1st cd is still my Favorite! This has some great songs but it has a harder edge than her previous material.It was proof that she was growing and maturing with each release! She still has her signature raspy voice and proves she can run with the big boys as usual.I still recommend you buy this cd along with her 1st 2.I believe its out of print now,but check the used section here and your local shops!"
5,Classic stuff!!!,"If you enjoy rock and roll with female singers (Heart, Pat Benatar, etc), you have to own this.I agree with another reviewer that the opening track is lame. However, track #2, AIN'T THAT JUST LIKE LOVE is awesome, and things move along nicely from there. LOTS of good stuff on here, and Fiona has a gorgeous voice (she's not bad to look at, either).If you have the first Saraya CD and enjoy it, this blows that one out of the water, IMO. Also, the Jani Lane-penned LIFE ON THE MOON is a great tune, with a big guitar sound and tremendous vocals.Another quality (and hard to find) female-fronted band is Witness-their self-titled CD is another great one to track down."
4,acquired taste,"I fell in love with this popcorn years ago and until recently it required a trip to the islands to replenish my stock. Often times when I try to order it, it is out of stock. The shipping is a little steep but when you need the fix, you need the fix."
4,bellows,"I love the bellows and price, but hate the zip ties replacing clamps. I put my own clamps on them."
4,I So Wanted More Revenge For Her,There are enough detailed reviews on this one so i'll spare everyone. I only want to prepare you for lots of angst the hero was a SOB and he didn't grovel nearly enough as far as I was concerned and he had her in his control even when she ran away from him. I felt controlled on her behalf and still have a stomach ache over the stress of it all. Glad I got it free online otherwise I would have thrown the paperback across the room in retaliation. I know real mature but it is what it is. Enjoy
5,Outstanding,"I was a bit apprehensive when buying this one. But now, I only get awes for it. For a casual eye, it has the look of an Omega. But for the price, its look and feel is very amazing. I was amazed myself when I first opened the box. It's on the bigger side and chunky. It's heavy, specially for a small wrists like me. But nobody complained and certainly not me. I would rather blame my wrists. It's feature packed with very well luminous hands. And it certainly looks far better in real than in the product pictures."
2,Not bad for people on a budget,"The watch looked nice but it was way too heavy for a watch. The band also felt very cheap. However, it really looks like a Omega Seamaster from a distance so I guess that is a plus. I returned this item due to a delivery problem."
4,Nice time piece......,Good quality. Great price. I am going buy others from Nautica. I have other watches that cost more and this is just as good!
5,Be Careful What You Wish For...,"Gabby La La is like no other musician. It's no wonder why Les Claypool picked her up on his record label Prong Song. Gabby's musical instruments range from a sitar, accordion, toy piano, and ukulele. The album is filled with great music and lyrics all writen by Gabby except 'In Dreams' which was writen by the great Roy and Barbara Orbison. A few tracts are solos with Gabby playing the sitar or ukulele-""In and Out of Dreaming, Little fortune Cookie"", but all the other tacts contain Claypool on both bass and percussion. The album can seem a little bizzare for some, but for the many Claypool fans it should be right up their ally. Mixed with humorus lyrics and catchy riffs, you'll be singing these songs in your head all day long. So be careful what you wish for...'cause it might come true."
4,A little strange and ecclectic but otherwise excellent...,"I bought this album because I am a huge Primus/Claypool fan and after listening to the samples my kids loved it. Gabby La La's vocals sound sort of like Glinda the Good Witch fromthe Wizard of Oz. But if you can get by this or even like music that is a little off, then you need to check this out. All the instruments are played by La La and Claypool, and this really turned out to be quite a spectacle. If you like your music a little experimental, then I highly recommend this disk."
2,"Well produced, but kinda scary","The good news is that this is NOT a canned record label product. We have enough of that from Disney and that Kidz Bop crap. The bad news is that this album presents the exact opposite problem. It's just plain old weird. My daughter was physically scared by this album. Gabby is obviously talented, but her voice is somewhat eerie. Les Claypool's arrangements are excellent and the music is really well produced, but I wouldn't classify this as a kids album. Perhaps world? Scary world? Is that a genre? Anyway, my suggestion for Gabby is that she should embark on a dance album AKA Bjork since this is obviously the school she comes from. If you combine the world elements with her weird voice and add some dance beats, I am sure her fan base would expand.Here's my advice to all ""kids"" artists...Kids like to listen to great, groovy music. Kids, like other human beings, want to have fun. This album is anything but that, more a muse-o foray into oblivion."
3,Great overall introduction to R/3 Basis,"I bought this book after taking the BC360 SAP Basis course. It does a great job treating the material on SAP R3 Basis administration. However my only beef with the text is that it fails to cover the majority of database and SAP administration issues and tasks ie: SAPDBA, SAP R3 database tuning etc. It also covers authorizations and user account maintenance very lightly. However, I will say that I wish I had read this book a week before the BC360 class since I would have been much better prepared. Great as an introduction for advanced R3 Basis get Schneider's Performance Optimization R3 book and Jose Hernandez R3 book."
3,"usefull, but not a detailed reference","I currently support some some 2.2 and 3.x systems, and I bought this book looking for 4.x knowledge. To this end, it succeeds.However, there are many important parts of System Administration that are not covered, or that are barely touched on (i.e.Authorisation Administration, Backup and Recovery, Disk Management etc).Essentially, the book is written for someone who never (or rarely) exits the SAP GUI. Operating system and DBMS issues are not covered very deeply at all. I won't be using it as a BASIS reference book."
4,GOOD,"First off all... That was my first ""shop"" from amazon and was amazing... Amazon Works fast and fine...The book it is one of the best and taking best off them. I'll say more later..."
3,Usefull but not complete,"This handbook cover the most of daily problems of managing a SAP environment, however some particular and not so usual problems (like for example E-mail integration ) are not covered at all."
4,Kool Product,"Really like the lathe, package came wet and all retaped up, but being one unit was ok, scared at first, easy to use, everything works, have turned a few pens, have not tried a bowl yet, two main reasons I got it bowls and pens, got rid of an older shop smith for this so far good tool..variable speed nice option for finishing work and sanding"
2,Highly Rated but be Warned!!,"I ordered this lathe for Christmas and it arrived very fast indeed! Amazon out did itself on the shipping! BIG PROBLEM! My garage is wired with a GFI recepticle as are many houses built in the last 10 years. This model JML-1014VS will NOT run with in a GFI wired setting! I called Jet to inquire why the machine would not work, the short answer from JET is that this motor is not compatible with GFI. I am sure this is a great machine, but it will do nothing for me. So, if your work space is wired with a GFI, you have to disable the GFI (NOT RECOMENDED)or rewire a dedicated service for this particular lathe."
3,Dunno what to say?,"It went and went and went, and then the computer gave out. No one around here wants to work on the computer part of this lathe being VS. I've since bought a midi manual and a full size manual (both Deltas), and no problems.I'm not sure where in the world I'm supposed to take this to get it fixed, because I'd sure like to use the VS feature. Jet has been no help. Their service stations within 3 hours of here do not deal with lathes.The power switch on this lathe will go out on you too. Either have several switches on hand, or use an external in-line switch for it. This should be expected, as much as a person turns a lathe on and off."
1,careless,This item was shipped to me twice with the speed control box shattered and pieces all over the box. The problem lies in Jets packing and U.P.S. shipping methods. Amazon was very good about making things right. I opted to go with the non-variable speed model and glad I did. I don't change speeds that much.
3,Not what I expected,"The lathe was advertised as variable speed and it is,but you still must change pullys to get the full speed range. I bought another lathe from Grizzly for 1/3 the price and it is full variable speed 0-4000."
2,bad blu-ray disc,I purchased this item 6 months ago but am just now watching the blu-ray disc for the first and the bottom of the screen is flickering. I read the back of the box and said made in Mexico maybe that's why the quality is so poor. The dvd disc works fine and that's what we've been using. If I would have known I would get a bad quality blu-ray from amazon I would have saved my money and just bought the dvd. I've bought plenty of blu-ray discs from amazon before so I really disappointed to get a bad disc since I've had such great history with them till now.
3,"Cute, but could be better","Hop has Russell Brand as the voice of E.B. the son of the Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie) who's supposed to inherit the job but he just wants to be a drummer. So he runs off to Hollywood where he meets a deadbeat played by James Marsden who has no goals or ambition. But together they'll find out what they are meant to do.That's not all but if I give away more, that's the whole movie pretty much. The movie feels a little rushed and half the time Marsden doesn't seem to even be looking in the direction of the CGI bunny. I know it's silly to say, but Matthew Lillard at least managed to some how have chemistry with the CGI Scooby Doo in those films. I like Marsden but he feels a bit awkward in Hop. While, am not sure what they were thinking by having the bunny poop jelly beans in a family film. It's nice to get an Easter film, but Hop didn't really leave me with much, the end is kind of silly actually."
5,Great family flick ! Finally a great easter kids movie!,This was a great movie! It has become my 5 year old daughters current favorite movie...Surpassing Tangled which says alot about this movie ! The Easter Bunny brought her 1 of his royal guard the Pink Berets from build a bear which she says must be magic if he brought it all the way from easter island! She is counting the days till this comes out on DVD and has made us promise we will buy this the day it comes out ! It was a really cute movie that your young kids will love and isnt a bad movie for mom and dad either ! We really enjoyed it !
2,Excellent Family Fun,"I first saw this movie with grandkids when it first came out, and thought it was a wonderful exciting family movie. When it came out on DVD, I was disappointed. I really wanted the Blu-ray disc, but the only way that was sold was with the 150% useless ultraviolet so-called ""digital"" copy. If I can't put it on my iPod, it just another Warner Bros. Waste of time. I refuse to pay for it. So I got the regular DVD, and will have to be satisfied with it. For those of you who don't understand the Ultraviolet ""digital"" copy, they give you a serial number that you upload and then they store it in a cloud for you, and it is to their discretion how long it lasts. So, you are NOT paying for the digital copy, but merely renting it. To watch it on your android based phone, you must first log on to the internet and then go to your flixster acct to retrieve the movie, if it's still available. Kinda tough to watch a movie that way at 30,000 feet."
4,Super cute!,"Slow to start, but a great finish! Wonderful for young children, and sophisticated enough for adults. Loved the cameo by Russell Brand. :)"
1,Rebuffering,Frustratibg to have the movie stop numerous times to Rebuffer. This happens every time on amazon. Other service don't do it as often?
1,NO,"About a bunny who poops jelly beans and some how lives in a mansion. About a man with no ambition other than becoming an Easter bunny. Sadly, he does not achieve said dream and becomes a ""co-Easter bunny"". A movie with absolutely no depth, or meaning. Not even my seven year old sister found this funny. Oh yeah, and I only gave it one star cause I had to put in a rating."
2,"Nonsensical, even for a kids movie","I was disappointed in this movie. This is one of those movies that is so sloppily done that it leaves nothing except randomly animated slapstick humor. Your kids may enjoy it well enough, but this isn't a movie that mom and dad and the kids will all get something out of."
4,Would totally Buy this ( we rented it from Blockbuster's ),I am really picky about the movies I would let my kids watch more than once. I would buy this movie. So cute and rockin' !!!
2,Hop away from this movie,"Sorry, folks, but this is not a good movie. The premise behind this flick is too silly for words; to me it looked like someone took every cheesy son-of-Santa movie, stuck them in a blender, hit puree, and then used a word processor to replace the word Christmas with Easter."
4,Fun Movie,"This was a fun movie, but the best part was renting through Amazon Instant video. My child was sick and it was great to be able to get her something new to watch while stuck in bed without leaving the house."
3,Hop for Easter with the kiddos,"Movie was pretty corny but overall ok. The kids aged 4,5, and 7 liked it enough to watch it again the next morning!"
3,Good movie fun for the kids.,"This movie is ok. My daughter loves bunnies so that is why we got it for her, but I think overall it is average."
4,Fast service,"The movie came very quickly. As I watched it, there were 2 glitches from scratches on the surface. We can still catch most of the funny film."
5,gottah see!,"Its a got to see movie again, I loved it and so did my daughter and the rest of my family. you going cry and laugh when you see this movie. I wish it was on dvd already!"
2,Lurking envious foes will smile,"""The word pariah came into English from Tamil paraiyar, the plural of paraiyan, which literally means 'drummer' and comes from the word parai, the name of a drum used at certain festivals... Its use in English and its extension in meaning probably owe much to the long period of British rule in India."" -American Heritage DictionaryRussell Brand is the voice of the Easter Bunny's teenage son, who decides to travel to Hollywood to become a drummer in a rock band instead of succeeding his father on Easter Island. He also poops jelly beans, as many reviewers have already noted."
3,I really did not Hop for it.,I watched the movie with my teenager niece. The movie had it moments but was not as funny as the trailers. Enjoyable but not very funny.
3,Hop,For me as a 21 year old it was a so-so movie but since I'm a babysitter my kids thoroughly enjoyed it and it kept them entertained. Maybe I wasn't such a big fan of it because they showed a lot of things in the previews. Now don't think I'm just a typical 21 year old who only watches dirty movies and that's about it. I still have my inner child I enjoy cartoons and Disney movies but I just thought the movie lacked several things. Personally I think 7 and under will love it but older than that may not like it as much.
3,it's no Despicable Me!,It was watchable but I was expecting more from these guys. Kids would still probably like it just fine though.
2,Tried to like it,"The kids like this OK, but it is not my favorite. I think the problem is that I really don't like EB. He is annoying in a not funny way. It is a shame, because I like the other characters--the cast is great and the idea is funny. Music is good, but we don't watch it very often. It is not one the kids ask for, like Despicable Me--the kids want to watch that one again and again."
2,Cute but a sleeper,I'm giving it 2 stars because it's cute but overall it was just a mess... It was predictable of course and very boring in between little small jokes
1,Rental would not download,this was a $3.99 rental purchase that did not download and after many attempts I gave up. did not get to see the movie.
5,HOP on over,This movie is great for kids and adults. It is wholesome and fun something not often found in todays films.
1,Ultraviolet digital copy is useless!!!,"The movie itself is not bad. Not overwhelmingly great, but still cute. However, if you are buying a movie for the digital copy, DO NOT BUY ULTRAVIOLET!!!! The ultraviolet digital copy makes you set up two different accounts and you still cannot transfer it to iTunes. After contacting customer service several times I received the same information which was not helpful at all and was still unable to watch the digital copy except on my computer after logging into these weird accounts. Digital copy is useless if it is ultraviolet!!!"
4,Not your typical kid movie,"I was expecting a kid movie, but got something different. Not really an adult movie either. Family for sure, but with some mature humor. It is good enough for me to show my grandchildren at Easter time."
5,Great movie! Loved the whole thing. Can't wait to buy the DVD,"I have been waiting anxiously for this movie to come out! I saw it in theaters with my 3 sons and we had a great time. With Easter coming up I can't wait to see it again and was even looking online to try to find it. I thought E.B. was a great character and the plot was cute for kids but still fun for me. I am not sure my husband will want to watch this movie more than once, but the other 4 of us will watch it again and again!"
1,"If you are really desperate for an Easter movie to entertain your children with, this may work. Otherwise, avoid it!","Just watched this movie for the first time last night. I had avoided renting it for over a year, as the previews I had watched convinced me this movie would not be one I would enjoy. Boy was I right! Though my kids said it was OK, I found it to be dull, nonsensical, and tedious to watch. Unlike many kids' movies that are entertaining to adults, as well, this movie put my wife right to sleep and drove me for my iPhone for rescue. Though the actors and animators did their jobs just fine, the boring plot, ludicrous characters, and lack of wit or real humor made this movie a real chore to sit through. One viewing was too many, and I give any other parents fair warning to steer clear of this snore-fest. Worst kids' movie I have seen sinceFurry Vengeance!"
2,NotAMoviePerson,starts out good... gets lame... ends even lame-er. Cute graphics would only be for small kids. Fail on what could have been a cute concept movie. The plot was blown to pieces as the movie progressed. The resolution was an epic fail. Perfect example of why I am not a movie person. PASS.
4,"Funny, sweet","My daughter absolutely loved this film. I'll have to admit I liked it as well, it was funny and cute."
3,"Cute for kids, I fell asleep","This was pretty cute and the kids loved it however not as entertaining for adults. Oh well, I rented it for the kids anyway!"
3,;0),"My kids and I have now watched this 3 times, all within the same week. I am hoping they will get tired of it really soon but it was cute as a button."
1,Hop,"If you were sad that the world had yet to see an animated/live-action hybrid film catering specifically to crowds anticipating the secular aspects of Easter, chin up! In the grand tradition of films like The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks comes Hop, the tale of a CGI rabbit who dreams of becoming a drummer and instead crosses paths with a slacker human with a surprising knack for delivering Easter candy to kids the world over. Let's be honest here: Alvin and the Chipmunks made over $350 million worldwide at the box office and spawned two sequels, and Hop made over $180 million itself. In other words, even though the movie was horrible, it's pretty clear I am not the target demographic. Want something silly and formulaic to babysit the kids while you tend the barbecue? Here you go."
1,Not funny!,"I took my grandkids, ages 3 and 5. They see a lot of movies like this. We were all disappointed. The three year old kept telling me the movie would have a good part soon. They liked the pink ninja bunnies and that was it for the entire movie. I didn't give them my opinion in case they were enjoying the film, but they weren't and I thought it was lackluster and sadly silly."
1,"Um, no","About a bunny who poops jelly beans and some how lives in a mansion. About a man with no ambition other than becoming an Easter bunny. Sadly, he does not achieve said dream and becomes a ""co-Easter bunny"". A movie with absolutely no depth, or meaning. Not even my seven year old sister found this funny. Oh yeah, and I only gave it one star cause I had to put in a rating."
2,"Paid $4 rental, worth $1.99","Yes, there are fun moments, but that's all they are - moments. Between the moments the screen play is slow and plodding. A few times the action actually builds, but instead of making it to the top of a mountain of excitement you realize you're floating ever so slowly down into a pastel colored swirl of bordom with a...ah..zzzz. Grade A animation with a grade B plot and screen play. Somebody tazer me to get my heart beating again please."
5,Excellent Purchase,"Amazing Landscapes Vol. 3 is an excellent purchase! The DVD is great for landscaping ideas for home owners with big aspirations and professional landscapers looking to develop their artistic eye. Each project is hand crafted, unique, and very artistic. Flagstone Palace stood out to me...incredible. There are many other amazing landscapes, waterfalls and terraces...Check it out!"
3,The orientation of the sigs are off.,"Overall, this is a great tool to expand my children's fingerspelling skills. As a deaf person proficient in American Sign Language, I noticed that J, X, and Z are done backwards or incorrectly. I wished they did their research before releasing their product.However, this does not stop my kids from having fun with this product."
1,Worth it for the psychosomatic benefits!,"Despite their claims, I could hear no audible difference with alternative, reasonably priced cables.""You don't have to spend thousands of dollars upgrading your components to achieve high quality audio reproduction. You simply need to upgrade your systems connections with high quality Monster Standard Interlink 200 audio interconnect cables.""No, you may not have to spend thousands to upgrade your component sounds, but investing in good quality components and speakers will make a difference. Spending extra on the ad agency copy that Monster Cables specializes in will only improve your mental image of your stereo.Then again, satisfaction is all in your head.If you don't immediately sense how patronizing AND incorrect the above quote is, you probably should follow their advice."
3,Monster with feet of clay,These cables appear so massive that they could never break. But 2 of the RCA-type end connectors out of 6 total had too loose a grip to make a solid and permanent connection. I had to tighten them with needle-nose pliers. Never had that happen with cheap cables.
1,You must be joking!,"As a licensed engineer, I can say that I would NEVER recommend such an absurdly self-inflated product to my customers. When they have $825.00 to waste on such an item, I am ethically obligated to recommend appropriate value-added services. Unfortunately, there is a sucker born every minute which, by the way, was not a statement by P.T. Barnum.Btw, 0 stars is not an allowable option for reviews."
4,Lyrics from STX hitting hard!,This a great 1st album for the artist Ras Iba...VI massive! Hard hitting lyrics about the conditions of the youth at home reminds us all that we must put the children first if we are to move forward as a people.Give thanks for Ras Iba and Jah Bless!
2,waste of money,After finishing the bottle of product I notice no change what-so-ever. Did not work for me at all. Waste of money.
1,What A Joke,This is a horrible movie it is about a bunch of psycho teenage kids who lose it after James Dean death I mean come on man do yourself a favor don't waste 19.99 $ as I just did it is a BAD movie
2,Classic US Stamps only,"This is essentially a statistical extract of auction lots with some editorial comment for each ""Classic US"" stamp presented. It does not deal with any modern issues or give any insight about the general subject of buying US issues at discount prices. After reading this book, I have no confidence that a beginning or even intermediate collector can avoid buying troublesome classic stamps without expertization."
2,Statistical abstract,"Classic US stamps only. This is not a book for the general US collector or someone seeking information on the best method of buying for his/her US collection, since it deals with US Scott Catalog numbers before 834 only. The likelihood of forgery, fault repair, regumming or other misrepresentation in these issues must be extraordinary, given the frequent use of the term, ""Beware."" Mr. Datz makes a strong case for expertization of nearly every issue in this group. The data on scarcity may be useful for debunking those advertised ""really scarce"" offers in this high dollar area."
3,Best in Music,The musicians and actors in this magnificent disc are the worldd's best. The Wedding Song is a treasure and Glenn Close (who knew she could sing like that???) makes your heart stop with pleasure. Bernadette Peters will make you cry. This music should be a MUST in every library.
3,Disappointed that the full performance not shown,"I am a huge Sondheim fan, but I am disappointed that some of the performances that made the CD recording did not make it to the videotape. For example, the medley of ""Waiting for the Girls Upstairs - Love, I Hear - Live Alone and Like It"" would have been enjoyable to watch, as was the ""Remember"" piece from ""A Little Night Music."" It makes an uneducated viewer wonder why these people join everyone in singing the end to ""A Weekend in the Country."" The order in which they present the songs is a little perplexing. This videotape would work much better if they maintained the integrity of the production by presenting everything in the manner in which it was performed."
3,WARNING! This is not the entire concert!,"If you have this soundtrack, or have seen the program on PBS - it's fantastic, but be warned that this DVD does not tell you it's about HALF of the concert as represented in the soundtrack and on TV. What there is - is fabulous - but I was VERY disapointed that this DVD did not represent itself accurately. It should be clearly marked ""Selections from..."" or something like that, otherwise, it'd decieving. So if you're expecting some of your favorite songs - don't buy it."
4,Dirty Harry Meets the WHeel of TIme,"This was pretty predictable. Very bad guy does many bad things to good guys buddies and friends. The good guy hunts him down for a final show down.So much for the plot, this was a very enjoyable romp. Marcus Wynne knows his guns and hardware so there were no .38 Glock revolvers in this book. What sets this book apart is the Aborignal mysticism that is the core of the fight between Charley and Alfie.I also appreciate that Wynne moves the plot right along. My one complaint is that everything was very pat and tied together. Life is a bit messier than this.Oh, one other thing it is pretty clear that Wynne likes a Glock 30. I prefer a Glock 36 for my carry piece.Still this is a book to read and an author to track.Bye the bye mate - Wonk! Wonk!"
4,Outback battles,"Good action with some mystical stuff thrown in. The author knows his stuff and it shows, I await his next work."
4,Kudos to Wynne: another winner,"Aside from the intelligent action, Marcus Wynne has the rare ability to blend charasmatic depth to his central characters. This is a rare skill in the action genre.Im on the road 160 days a year and go through books very quickly...I know a book is great when I dont want it to end...I felt that way with both of Marcus's books, you cant' but help like the characters.Wynne's books are now on my short list of authors... if youre looking for orginal stories, subtle and witty dialogue, read both his books.Tony Blauer"
5,Senior Citizen gets adrenaline rush from book.,"The pull behind Warriors in the Shadows was so great, I almost missed going to daily Mass. The smooth transitions of events from chapter to chapter took such hold of me I would have stayed up all night if my 70-year-old eyes let me. Needless to say, I gave up breakfast just to finish the book. This is a real 'wow' book and so satisfying. Even the descriptions of weapons seemed to be integral to the plot and I even read them if just to compare weapons, and for a little old lady, that is something. I love the battle scene. The writer's descriptions sure took me into the cave and yet made me see and feel for the aborigines. I see them as powerful despite their ancient practices especially in this technological world."
2,Ana Torroja and Miguel Bose: Girados Live,"Very mediocre live concert video, it should be better if the concert was taped live, instead too much editing, which diminished the dvd. The cd was way much better. This is the perfect example of a live concert being screwed by too much editing."
3,NO ES LO QUE ESPERABA,"LA CALIDAD DE SONIDO ES BUENA Y LA IMAGEN TAMBIÉN. LO QUE NO ME GUSTÓ ES QUE EL CONCIERTO NO ESTE DE CORRIDO, CADA DOS CANCIONES METEN UN COMENTARIO DE BOSE O ANA O JUNTOS EXPLICANDO LA CANCION QUE SIGUE. DEBE SER QUE A MI ME GUSTA VER EN DVD LOS CONCIERTOS COMO SI ESTUVIESE AHI, SIN INTERRUPCIONES. NO DIGO QUE ESTÉ MAL EL PRODUCTO PERO NO LLENÓ MIS ESPECTATIVAS."
3,pudo ser mejor!,"es una lastima que tremendo espectaculo no se supo aprovechar con toda la calidad que ofrece un DVD. empezando por el sonido, y debieron permitir que se pueda deshabilitar los comentarios intermedios de estos tremendos artistas para poder disfrutar de la magia de este concierto."
5,The best of the best!,"I can't stop playing this DVD; what a couple: Ana and Miguel have done the best performance in their artistic lives. Don't miss it, it's really worth it...in Spanish:""lo mejor que he visto en DVD's"""
3,Good material/bad technical quality,"The material selected is excellent, and the quality of the interpretations is 5 stars, but the technical quality of the DVD is not very good by the following reasons:-The Bitrate of the video is about half in average of what a good quality video has, therefore is VERY easy to have frames full of little squares. In conclusion, mediocre video quality..-They choose Dolby Digital 2.0 as the soundstream. I do not mind Dolby digital with multichannel, but with a Stereo soundtrack they should have used PCM to appreciate the true sound quality that a DVD can offer, so in this DVD you have less quality than a CD (Dolby Digital means compressed, like an MP3)."
5,FANTASTICO,Entre los tantos DVDs de conciertos que colecciono este es uno de mis favoritos. El sonido y la imagen son impecables. El concierto es bastante largo y se interrumpe con explicaciones de los protagonistas dando alguna idea del tema que viene. MUY BUENO
4,The price is right,"For a beginner woodworker with a router, it is a good starter set. I regularly use the 3/8 roundover bit and receive good clean cuts. Very happy with my purchase. BTW - Skil is owned by Bosch ( a top notch tool company)."
4,Great dress,My daughter loves this outfit. She wore it as a halloween costume and now wears it every chance that she gets. It has faded a little after a couple of washings but other then that it is great.
5,A truly inspirational movie that will make you think & feel,"The Stan ""Tookie"" Williams Story is one of the stories that really makes you look at the world and how we are living are every day lives.I found this movie to be surprisingly touching and it really made me think of the whole prison system. I didn't really know about this story of Stan Williams as I live in Ireland, Dublin. I rented this movie and after watching it, I couldn't stop thinking of the story and the whole meaning to forgive. I felt Jamie Foxx acting was astonishing and made the film really work of course the storyline was the major part. I first seen Jamie Foxx in Any Given Sunday, I figured he would disappear after words as he was just a comedian at the time, but how I was so wrong. I feel that he could act any role he wanted; he is a truly brilliant actor.I think this movie is probably one of the most amazing eye openings I ever seen, hopefully people will see this and be inspired to recognize the truth."
4,nominado al premio nobel de la paz,"basada en una historia real, nos pone pensar si realmente es la pena de muerte un metodo de justicia. Tookie nominado al premio nobel de la paz por sus escritos sobre las gangas y/o pandillas en el estado de california y sus consecuencias, trabajo para orientar a los niños y alejarlos de estas y todo desde la prision donde cumplia condeda por asesinato. Claro y la estupenda interpretacion de Jamie Foxx en mi apreciacion unos de sus mejores papeles dramaticos."
3,IT WAS O.K.!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS O.K. SO MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME TO GET THIS MOVIE. SO I DECIDED TO GET IT AND WATCH THIS MOVIE. I WAS EXPECTING A LITTLE BIT MORE. U KNOW SHOWIN WHEN HE WAS ON THE STREETS AND WHEN THE POLICE CAME TO HIS HOUSE TO ARREST HIM, JUST MORE OF WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE HE GOT PUT ON DEATHROW. BUT IT WAS GOOD HE REALLY DID CHANGE WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON. BUT ONCE AGAIN I WANTED MORE. AND I DIDNT LIKE THE WAY IT ENDED. COULD HAVE ENDED A LITTLE BIT BETTER........UR GIRL JENN*****"
1,Propaganda/PR Piece,"Mr. Williams has never confessed, never expressed remorse, and never apologized for the murders he committed. How is that ""Redemption""?If Mr. Williams had truly been redeemed, he would have renounced his own personal violent acts, apologized for them, and cooperated with police to take more violent criminals off the streets. He is not interested in anything but saving his own life at this point, PR campaign notwithstanding. This film is a piece of propaganda masquerading as a biopic."
4,Very adaptable,"As a small framed guy, I found the small size to be just right. My inguinal hernia is on the right side but I found that by eliminating the right side pad,then taking the left side pad, flipping it over so the flat side faces in, then inserting it in the right side pouch, made it much more comfortable. I have found also that I get much better support when I pull the sides of the belt up high and over my hip bones which prevents it from sliding down. This takes some experimentation so that the hernia belt is supported by my regular belt that runs through the loops of my jeans. Ultimately, my intent is to have my hernia repaired using the Desarda method which uses no-mesh. If any of you out there are considering surgery, please do your homework and read about all the complications people have encountered with mesh. Until then, this truss should help a lot."
4,"It does the job and it's not ""bulky""","I bought two of these support belts so I could always have one ready to wear when washing the other one.It does the job nothing to say about it! The only problem, if I can call it so, is the two straps in the groin. Sometimes one might get kind of ""in the way"", you know what I mean.But then again, it's a truss and nobody said it had to be 100% comfortable.Finally I had surgery and now I don't have to wear it anymore.Would I use it again?Yes.Other thoughts:It takes too long to dry, especially if you air-dry it as manufacturer recommends."
1,"Wrong Size on Website, poor customer service","After I ordered the product, I noticed some of the reviews said the measurement should be the hip size, and not the waist size as it says on the website. I emailed the company about the size I ordered and cancelling the order. Medlife never responded to my cancellation, and the product was delivered several days later. Now they want me to pay for shipping and a restocking fee. I will never use this company again."
1,leg straps way too long,"my waist and hip size are both 36"" so I ordered the medium size.Box has size Medium on the barcode. Legs straps are about 10"" too long.Gonna try attaching some velcro strips (from Lowes or hardware store) and cutting off excess since its not returnable.Sizing seems to be way off for the smaller side of the product."
3,"well, it was worth a shot","This support belt just didn't work for me in the end. My hernia has really progressed and this belt doesn't have the lift from down under that I need. For early stage hernia, this product will provide some relief. The difference being where and how bad the protrusion is. It did what it was designed to do, and provided some relief, it just wasn't exactly what I needed."
2,Packaging arrived crushed.,The packaging for thjis product arrived crushed from inadequately packaging. Retailer contacted me but did not follow through on promise to rectify the problem.Bill Flatley207 236 6544
4,FINALLY RELIEF,"I was about to give up hope having just returned a completely unusable support belt. Then after reading several opinions I decided that this seemed sensible. Before it arrived I was helpless. It arrived. I put it on with little difficulty and a miracle occurred. I have used it for over a week. All types of exercise, dancing, etc. No problems. The only thing that would make it a five star would be to have two small belt loop like straps on the wings over your hip bone. This would secure the device and the waist strap in place no matter what you were doing. The more I use it the easier it is to use it.Florida Orthopedics Soft Form Hernia Belt - #67-350500 - Size Medium - Completely Adjustable Without Metal Snaps or Buckles"
4,Amazing,"This hernia belt is a wonderful product! Although it is not too comfortable, it does the work and also allows people who are suffering from inguinal hernias stand and walk for longer periods."
1,Lame,Real flimsy. The size is over. I ordered n recieved a med but it fits like xl. I would not buy another one for sure.
4,Very pleased,"I have had 4 hernias and one now open. I do not understand it all, but it allows gas to form in my intestines. It can get trapped and become so painful I can hardly walk-in fact walking seems to promote the gas formation. To get relief I have to kneed my groan area to release to gas. I'm not trying to be crude, but it got to where my hand was inside my pants more than out. I could tell you a funny story about this-but I won't! This hernia belt is very easy to put on. To be effective the straps have to be tight to the point of being uncomfortable. There is also some chafing.I do not know how this product could be made any better.I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BELT!"
5,Ignore the negative reviews -- this is a great product,"I am still $aving for my groin hernia surgery and found this productto work great at keeping my bulge compressed in an essentially pain-free manner. Before, I was using my own straps and cloth (even balledsocks), but they hardly fit the bill. Whoever designed this belt has donean outstanding job with medical application design."
5,"Great Product. Couldn't have made it without this, maybe.","I developed an extremely painful hernia and could not immediately receive a surgical solution. Because of the incredible pain whenever it 'popped,' a temporary solution was needed. This truss was that solution. I wore it for 4 months, and it made my situation easily tolerable.Because I couldn't wait for a delivery, I did not buy via Amazon and instead made a purchase locally.Observations:1. This is a great product. If you have a hernia that is periodically painful, this will help. A lot.2. Pay attention to sizes. Locally and through Amazon, it's not returnable if the package has been opened.3. There are warnings about how to clean (or not clean) the truss. Follow them.4. Buy from Amazon if you can and save $$$."
5,"""Saved My Life""","This hernia belt ""saved my life"". A month before my family (10 of us) and I were to spend 4 days at Disneyland and 2 days in San Diego I came down with an inguinal hernia. All the reservations had been made last year and big money was involved. There was no way I was going to get this hernia fixed and recover in a month. This belt allowed me to do everything I wanted to do during our trip. This involved being on my feet for 17 hours for three continuous days at Disneyland and 2 days in San Diego. I had my hernia surgery three days ago and I am on the road to recovery. Hernias don't repair themselves they only get worse.If you want to function as if you didn't have a hernia while waiting for surgery I recommend you get this belt."
4,"7 Day, 2 Day shipping?","Ordered this truss, got it yesterday. I wore it all day today. I have to say it really made a difference. My job is somewhat physical, with this truss my hernia did not bother as much today. Word of advice, like they say measure around the top or slightly below your hip ""bone"" like they say and it should fit going by your measurement. I used a piece of string and a regular tape measure. Also, going by some of the pics i have seen of hernias I would say mine is fairly minor(for now). I only gave four stars because someone(Amazon or UPS) dropped the ball on delivery. It took 7 days, not 2 days to receive the truss. That has been happening a lot lately. Don't get me wrong I love shopping on Amazon and will continue shopping with them. Most of the time I am in no hurry for anything, this one item was the exception for obvious reasons. Also I ordered another truss from Amazon today."
1,Cheap imitation,"This is a cheap imitation of the FLA Orthepedic belt. This belt also runs huge. I have a 35 1/2 inch hip and ordered small and it was too big!!! I have a FLA Orthepedic In medium and ordered this in small not realising it was not the same belt or manufacturer (was fooled by the picture). The FLA Orthepedic belt runs much more true to size. even the 2 FLA Orthepedic belts I purchased are a little different, but I will still recommend them.I have tried 5 different hernia supports now and far and away the best, at least for me, is the Flat Pad Support from the Support Company. I have two of their belt and another on order. I put it on in the morning and take it off at night and it stays very comfortable and keeps my hernia in when I sneeze, cough, lift. It's expensive but well worth it!!Hope this review helps"
4,Good support.,"Overall this is a good product. It is a little uncomfortable,but serves its purpose by providing good support. The padding does slip out of position if you walk allot and sit a stand up frequently. Would suggest these for anyone having a hernia."
5,Monster Proved Its Price,"After reading a review, by a disgruntled Monster Cable Purchaser (here, at Amazon), I purchased a brand selling for 50% less. I got 50% less visual resolution. After rubbing my eyes red, from using the lower cost cables with MSNTV, I came to my senses and ordered the POD. Big difference. The [money] I spent on the other brand was money thrown away. A worth while alternative for older model TV's, that are still quality televisions, without a ""S"" video jack. MAH"
4,Handy desktop item,"Purchased this to help keep track of multiple class projects and to hold documents while I type. Works well for sorting, and tucks away behind my computer screen when not actively in use. It is simple to insert documents into the holder, but this same simplicity allows documents to be easily knocked out. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It was inexpensive and it suits my needs."
4,Works pretty well,This works pretty well. I had one for home and I just bought a second for work. The only con I have is that the bottom isn't weighted enough so if you put 10 pages in certain slots it will tip over.
5,The most beautiful book,I have an Ukrainian edition of this book.Without a doubt it's the most beautiful book I've ever held in my hands.
4,"Would give 5 stars for illustrations, but not for content","The illustrations in this book are truly breathtaking, the details are amazing! In fact, I am so impressed, I'm looking for posters and other art that can be displayed to decorate my daughter's room.However, the text was a surprise... I did not remember such a strong religious context in it. Even though I already purchased the book, I'm hesitant to read it to my daughter, which is why I give the book 4 stars only."
2,Poor Quality Control,"Machine came well packaged, but needing adjustments and alignments to blades. Snipe was very pronounced and as of yet I have been unable to reduce it much. I will eventually call Powermatic for advice on reducing the snipe or having a technician look over the problem. At present, I would not recommend this product."
3,Maybe a mistake,I purchased this machine several years ago. Presently it costs $800 more than the Delta model.Things to consider.What do you do when you nick a blade? Can't sharpen it on my Tormek T7.Two speeds 16 and 20. I can't tell a difference.The Delta's top speed is 30 fpm. That is a big difference in performance.When planing long boards you have to adjust infeed and outfeed tables on the Powermatic.The Delta allows companies to make permanent infeed and outfeed tables.Mobile base is inline and doesn't allow you to turn easily.Just things to consider. I agree if you are going Powermatic the HH design is probably the better choice.Bobby Stanley
4,Between 3.5 and 4 stars,"I picked up this CD a few days ago and while I find it very enjoyable I can't give it five stars like everybody else. Some of the songs go on a little longer than they need to, almost everyone one on the disk is over 5 minutes! At times they also remind me of Whitesnake, among others, which is not a horrible thing but not a great thing either. Overall, this CD is a worthwhile purchase if you've never heard of Thunder and are looking for something new after completing your Zeppelin, Who, Purple, Sabbath, etc. collections. I'd agree that's it's better than just about anything coming out today (not too hard to do that) but it's still a couple of notches below the best that British rock has to offer."
5,Great blues based Brit Rock...,"Backstreet Symohony is a great release from a great band that simply flew under most people's radar because they were never able to get that hit single in the States. Thunder plays simple straightforward blues based rock with great hooks and melodies(they are NOT a ""hair band"" as they are sometimes lumped in with). Full of guitars, great vocals(I really like Don Bowes' voice) and lyrics with tounge in cheek humor this is just good FUN rock'n'roll.Song Highlights include: Dirty Love, Backstreet Symphony, Love Walked In, An Englishman On Holiday(should be on every barroom jukebox), Gimme Some Lovin'(good cover) and Distant Thunder.If you are a fan of guitar based rock, Thunder delivers it in spades and Backstreet Symphony is worthy of a place in your collection."
5,Similac is easy to use as ready to feed.,"Similac is usually a bit cheaper than Enfamil, my twins take either formula. I like the ""ready to feed"" style formula sometimes even though it's more expensive than the powder, because it is very convienent."
4,"Dull For Adults, But Does Seem To Help With Math Fact Memorization","This is simply a CD of songs that repeat subtraction-related math facts over and over to different tunes and in different patterns. I bought it at the same time asAddition Songs Cdand play both in my car, for my 2nd grader (with my twin 5-year olds also listening.) I find it extremely dull, but the kids actually like it, and sing along. In some places the CD stays silent in the answer portion, so that the kids are supposed to sing along and fill in the blank, which they like. It does seem to be helping my daughter with the rote memorization of these math facts needed to do well on the timed math tests many schools begin at this age. And it is certainly less painful than flash cards, which both my daughter and I hated.I don't think my kids would listen to it at home though, it is really best used in a car, so if you have some regular car-time and need some math facts reinforcement, this is a good option."
3,Canon S3 Fish eye,"This is a fun little lens and a great bargain, more well made than I anticipated.."
1,Buy Standard Deviants,"Buy Standard Deviants School - Basic Math, Program 1 - Integers & Addition (Classroom Edition) (2004)Both are one and the Same and Price is just less than $2"
3,Just ok.,I keep this bit set in my basement where it's dry and they have still rusted for some reason. But for the low price they still do the job.
5,gorgeous,"I got this for my aunt for christmas one year, just on a whim, and every year since she's always made absolutely certain that I'm getting it for her again. She loves it. The thing I like most about it is that it's got a new photo every time you flip a page... I hate the kind that only have, like, 5 pictures total in the whole thing. I suppose my only caution would be that having so many great pics leaves less room for actual writing space... so if you're one of those people who need to plan out ever last little 15 minutes of time between 6 am and midnight... this might not be best for you. ;]"
1,A Treasure Better Off Lost,"""Verdun"" is, sadly, a wretched novel. The writing is shabby, the translation shabbier. The characters are undeveloped and there is no plot. Although in some war novels the chronology alone might suffice to drive the narrative, here the writer leaves so many gaps in the chronology that the narrative breaks down. No wonder the French original is out of print. ""Verdun"" is no ""The Killer Angels,"" let alone ""All's Quiet."" I had hoped to find a novel with which I could teach WWI from the French perspective, but I must stick with Remarque."
3,"Spent, Apparently","These guys might have been done in by their own stylistic virtuosity as much as anything else. Originally known as Monkey Rhythm, the Spent Poets released this self-titled effort in 1992 and then sank without a trace shortly after the follow-up was shelved by the label. Predictably this is now a denizen of the ""Shame It's Out-of-Print"" File, but if you're a fan of late 80's/early 90's alternative, you should check it out if you stumble upon it. It has a quirky inventiveness, a bit of a postmodern Beatles feel. ""Your Existential Past"" is insanely catchy jangle-pop, ""You Don't Know Me"" rises and falls like a wave, and ""You Can't Kill Michael Malloy"" sounds like something off a period film soundtrack. As with any band that tries so hard to be cerebral and unique, there are moments of coyness and pretension, but these are a small price to pay. After all, how can you not like an album that samples ""Orphee"" and has a song named after Walt Whitman's facial hair?"
3,Cool little CD,"This is quite a good, quirky release. Not everybodys cup of tea but if you like pop music in the genre of PreFab Sprout, XTC, Squeeze, this one may be for you!"
3,Adorable,"This dog t-shirt is adorable and made in the USA, which I was thrilled with. Not having ever purchased attire for a dog before, I found it somewhat difficult to size. The medium was too small for my Jack Russell Terrier."
5,LOVE IT,"Love, love Tom Selleck! This is a great family relationship and wonderful interaction. Whole family loves it and can watch it together, rare."
5,Blue Bloods to Afghanistan,"My son is in Sharana, Afghanistan, and has not seen the TV series, Blue Bloods. So for his birthday, I ordered the first series to be sent to him. Much to my delight, he received it even before his birthday, in perfect condition and told me to write a good review because he was very pleased! Thank you!"
5,Strong family police drama,"I bought this sight unknown as I am a fan of Tom Selleck especially his Jesse Stone pictures.The first episode, I feel, was the weakest of them all. The series has built on each episode and has just got better and better. It's clear where the acting talent of the Wahlberg family lies, Donnie Wahlberg keeps building on his tough cop with a heart of gold part. Amy Carlson I haven't seen since Third Watch is great albeit in the background a little. Will Estes I have to say is easy on the eye but has a strong part. Tom Selleck as always has a strong role and plays it well.I like the family aspect of the show with the family sitting down once a week to have dinner, makes such a change from the spoilt, irritating, dysfunctional family dramas that are often seen on TV. I'm please to see it has gone on to a second series and if it keeps on with the family oriented plot lines and the always satisfying finalisation of each episode I feel this will go on for quite a few years."
2,blue bloods the first season,the discs were scratched and could't watch it so we returned it. i don't know if we will reorder or not.
3,Great show - Bad DVD's,"The first season of Bluebloods hooked me with good writing and storylines. I like the shows family centered focus and the way it takes on issues of morality and justice. Acting is good all around from a diverse and talented cast.The quality of the DVD's is another issue. Picture quality was poor on all the discs, all the episodes. It was curious because the menus were crisp and clear but as soon the the episodes started, the picture quality was grainy, pixelated like streaming without enough bandwidth. (I seriously wondered if I somehow ended up with some pirated disks.) It was very disappointing. I hope CBS puts season 2 out on Blue-ray."
3,WE HAVE A PROBLEM with Season one of the BLUE BLOODS,"We bought this DVD from Amazon a few months back and just got around to watching the 4th DVD of the 6 DVD et and it has a flaw in it and you can't really watch the 2nd, third and 4 story on this video because it shakes and misses etc. We have cleaned our DVD and tried to run it a couple more times and there is just a problem with this one record. The other 5 DVD's are fine. Can you replace this one DVD for us. This is a great series and I gave my husband the Season 2 series for Christmas but we haven't started that yet. WE ;OVE THIS SERIES but we would really love to have the one damaged video replaced in the 1st season. Are all the 4th DVD's bad in the first season? Who do I contact at Amazon about this problem? Any help will be appreciated? Thanks, Carol Murphy"
5,GREAT SHOW,"""Blue Bloods"" may be currently the best drama on television. Excellent writing, a fine ensemble cast and the plus of location shooting in NYC make me feel every episode ends too soon. Definitely a fan! I appreciate that I've been able to catch up on the show through Amazon since I only became aware of it this summer due to conflicts with Friday night viewing over the past couple of years."
5,Blue Bloods,"Bought this set for my father who lives in a ""rural"" area and has ""limited"" television programming. Cannot receive cable or satellite, so he doesn't get this show....thought he might like to have it to watch on occasion."
5,Donnie Wahlberg + Tom Selleck = Hit Show That Keeps ou Coming Back,"For those people who wrote this show off as just another shoot them up cop show, I urge you to reconsider. Tom Selleck is an amazing actor who really shows off his ability as an actor to create a realistic character that you can relate to right from the beginging. While Donnie Wahlberg shows that he is so much more then just a singer from a boyband. He pulls you into his world as a third generation New York City cop. He also shows you that he is part of a very close knit family (the Regans) that while they have their flaws come together to support one another.Great show that I think everyone should be watching!!"
5,Really Great Show,"I was already predisposed to love this show cos I'm a huge Bridget Moynaham & Tom Selleck fan, but I was still amazed at how great it was all pulled together. The only thing I could complain about is that it is only an hour long. I could easily watch it longer. I love the repore between Danny and his wife, the brother/sister comraderie between Danny & Erin. But I think I love the dinner scenes the best. You can tell they care about each other even when they have a difference of opinion. I never miss this show and I also take it so I can watch it again. I'm a diehard what can I say?"
5,Blue Bloods,"I love the characters, which means I miss Esposito,the Jackie character. I am encouraged by the family unity, the work ethic and parenting skills of all involved. Great family show even though there is some shooting involved. It is not about the shooting; it is about respecting our neighbors in our community who may have different beliefs and skin color. Tom Selleck is the greatest!"
5,"Selleck successfull, again !","This is one of the best new programs on the air this season ! The selection of parts for actors fits each character, and they blend personalities with the story line lending a dramatic portrayal of respect, duty, and honor to the reputation of any police department portrayed on television today."
5,"3 cheers for ""Blue Bloods""","I have followed the concept write-ups and CBS (Network TEN here in Australia) promotion of ""Blue Bloods"", and it gives me great pleasure in saying that the tone of this new drama (created by Mitchell Burgess and Robin Green, executive producers of ""SouthLAnd""; and executive produced by Leonard Goldberg) offers something very special to those of us who reminisce and crave a return to the days defining Robert J. Thompson's second golden age of television drama - I am thinking of Steven Bochco classics like ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Brooklyn South""; and the lesser known, but one which I hold fond memories of, ""Our Family Honor"". I highly, highly, highly recommend it!!!! And I look forward to the DVD!!!!"
5,Tom Selleck awesome,"What a great show, you have to see it. So much like a real family when you watch the day to day interactions."
2,Television series,"I love Tom Selleck, but sometimes it is too much. Plus, the acting isn't as good as in his other works."
5,Blue Bloods: Season 1,I am so thrilled with this DVD package! I can't wait until Season 3 comes out. I recommend this DVD series to anyone who loves police shows.
5,Best Show,This show is a great to watch specially if you like drama and action. The show has great cast and the plot of the show is great.
3,Tight connection. Not so good when used for Music,"Have brought 1 of these some months back. First impression were that it is very well built and the connectors really connect tightly to you RCA. I am using it as a Coaxial cable from the digital out of my CD player to my DAC. It is certainly an improvement from a standard coaxial cable. But after using it for some time, I found the music to be dull and lacking in dynamics. I thought it was due to my system but I swoop it to a Belden 1694a coaxial cable and the music instantly transformed. It became very dynamic and the bass tightens.I had compare these to the cables I have and these are my personal findings. Monster seems to image better than Canare GS1 but loss out in the dynamic. Currently, Belden 1964 is my choice when compared the the other 2.I would recommend this if you just need a good quality digital cable for other use. For music, please try something else."
1,Lost in the cable world,"As you know I just bought this cable along with the Panasonic DVD-RV31K as you people suggested. Very unfortunately I have no information either in the cable package nor in the player's manual on HOW OR WHERE TO INSTALL this cable from the palyer to my TV set (Sony KV-32S45). Please guide me where or whom to call for this information; otherwise, I'm going to return this cable to you. Thank you in advance for you help. Happy holidays."
3,A short history of American golf,"Though the game of golf was invented outside the US, and much of the drama takes place outside the US, this documentary is about American golf. Some amazing photos, but few good stories. With such an interesting topic, the History of Golf could have been fascinating, but it isn't."
1,Defective DVD,Dvd was defective. I could only view about five minutes of it. Had to throw it away. Is there any way it could be replaced?
5,I-Dog,MY DAUGHTER LOVED THE iDOG FROM THE MINUTE SHE OPENED UP THE PACKAGE. SHE IS ONLY 2 BUT EVERYTIME SHE WANTS TO LISTEN TO MUSIC OR DANCE SHE TURNS IT ON. ITS A GREAT GIFT FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES.
2,I Dog Pup,"I didn't realize this one didn't allow for an MP3 player to be plugged into it. All it does is move to music it hears if set by a speaker. Seems like a good enough product, but not what I was looking for."
4,Junie's Boy's Funeral,Good book. Fast read. Had quite a few surprises. Would definitely recommend reading.
4,Twist and Turns,I enjoyed this book. It is different from other books I have read. The characters were very entertaining and interesting. It was a quick read. Good luck on your next book.
4,Memoirs of a Librarian,"In light of recent budget cuts to school libraries around the United States, perhaps this memoir should be mass produced and made required reading of those in charge of setting budgets for schools. Her memoir shows all the hard work she and her colleagues did to grow the library school system and the rewards their work reaped in terms of test scores and other academic performance. I have to say that her style of writing is a little dry in places so its best read in small chuncks."
5,Fantastic Salsa from a mix and FAST to make,This year I have gone back to using Mrs Wages mixes. They are fast and easy to use. I always recommend Mrs. Wages to all new canners. It's a great way to build your confidence in canning. And its a great way to get your canning done if you need to get it done fast. And this Salsa mix still lets you add your own touch to make it just a little hotter or a little different. Yet still get it done fast!
3,Spring board to introduce classic artists,"A book intended for ages 4-10, the book attempts to introduce the artist and his paintings. A very dry attempt at that, but it is a great spring board to start. A very simple book with cartoons to atract young readers. Samples paints with breif explainations of each work. I have used this book only as an introduction. I do follow up with more books that give a deep explaination. This book is an inexpesive way for children to experience various paintings and engage their natural curiosity to investigate further. To introduce the artists and his works of art this is an average book for the young."
2,Basic-,"Very basic, a little under the age perspective I was hoping for. Would be for a very beginning reader, 5-6 y/o."
3,Great Material,The delivery of this book was done in a timely manner by Amazon.. The author was able to keep the material in a manner necessay to capture the readers attenton. I feel that this author made the reading material more enjoyable than any other of its kind that I had read recently..
2,Regency Fun,"A sweet and fluffy Regency period piece, unfortunately riddled with typos and transcription errors. Some sloppy punctuation also distracted from the story. I enjoyed the book, despite having to grit my teeth over these cosmetic flaws. I sincerely hope this is not a trend popular with this author or her publisher. With 90+ titles, I had hoped to read more of her work, but I refuse to spend my time and money on rough drafts and unedited novels."
4,More Traditional than Gigi's Previous Release,"Anything Gigi touches turns to gold. She could sing the alphabet backwards and it would sound good. As the liner notes will tell you, this is a ""concept album"" with a more classical or traditional Ethiopian sound (call and response singing phrases, traditional instruments like the washint [flute], and more acoustics). Four of the 10 songs are traditional, the others were written by Gigi. Like Gigi's last two albums, this one is also in collaboration with Bill Laswell.This is a beautiful album with more great singing from the excellent Gigi Shibabaw, good musicianship from Ethiopian musicians, very relaxing music. Check out Gigi's other albums as well."
1,The Scholarship Scouting Report: An Insider's Guide to America's Best Scholarships,The book was a waste of money! It is only good for high school students versus older students. It would have been nice to know this since I'm looking for my 24 year old son.
5,High quality cables,This product was an excellent buy. The cables are of good quality and transmit the signal without any noise. Highly recommended.
1,A great problem,I didn't receive the book. Where is my refund: I want receive the book or the refund. I payed two times the book and I didn`t receive. Carlos Alberto
1,Not like the old,Apparently Betsey Johnson's perfume has a new distributor? The quality does NOT compare. It's very disappointing- I loved her perfume and now I need to find a new scent.
3,Not So Perfect,"I was satisfied with the price and size of this bracelet, but when I received it, it was very dirty and needed to be cleaned before being given as a gift. Even after using sterling silver cleaner to remove the tarnish and trying to polish with a clothe there were still some imperfections. Looked like it had already been worn."
5,Track listing - some great late 80s/early 90s dance music on this cassette!,Songs on this cassette released by K-Tel in 1995 are:1. The KLF - What Time is Love2. 2 Unlimited - No Limit3. Technotronic - Move This4. Reality - Yolanda (Club Mix Version)5. Black Box - Strike It Up6. Snap - Ooops Up7. Soul II Soul Featuring Caron Wheeler - Back to Life8. Urban Cookie Collective - The Key the Secret9. Johnny Kemp - Just Got Paidand10. Information Society - What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)
2,Bait & Switch...GRRR,"Beware! I ordered this flashlight for my husband for Valentine's Day thinking it was the same MaxLife 369 that we had received as a Christmas gift a few years ago but a nephew broke the tripod latching system. It has six LEDs that make it possible to adjust the amount of light produced by clicking the on-off switch one to three times. The flashlight listed here says it has this feature, but it does not--it's one LED light.Not only that but the box that the light comes in is labeled on the actual box as 95-112 (which is not camouflage either), but has been relabeled with a sticker claiming that it's the more expensive 95-000Stanley 95-000 Tripod Flashlight, Camouflage. I'm not sure if that one would have had that adjustable lighting feature or not, but this one sure doesn't. I'm mad & I'm sending it back!"
3,OK-not the best,"The product is really solid, but it takes too many batteries to get it running. They better last for a long time."
4,Meets My Needs,"I read the previous reviews before making this purchase and I have no regrets. My only complaint was that assembly took a bit of muscle. I used the vaccume to remove a heavy accumulation of leaves - both wet and dry. Once or twice the unit got a little bogged down, but it quickly cleared and continued to eat up the leaves. What once took up 3-4 leaf bags, only required me to empty the bag twice. The fine mulch created by the leaves could be easily composted.I'm an average-sized female and the weight of this unit was just fine; easy to handle - not awkward at all. I wish I had bought this years ago. It saved me so much time.I have never heard of this brand before, so I didn't know what the quality would be like, but it seems to be well built, sturdy, and easy to store and maintain. Based on my experience with the leaf blower, I would purchase other products of this brand."
1,Did not even last a season,"Went to use my blower and it had shorted out in the switch. Lasted one Fall season. I'll be buying another, but a diff brand of course."
2,Worked great till it died,"Used it for about an hour, Fall of 2010. Seemed to work great, lots of power.Just took it out (Fall 2011) and it died after 20 mins of moderate use.The motor lost power and stopped working (this was while BLOWING, not mulching)- and the motor smelled like burned plastic. I reiterate, this happened while blowing- the motor was not under a load, as it would have been while mulching.I didn't purchase this from Amazon, and I've lost my original purchase documents, so I haven't attempted to exercise the 2-year warranty. With leaves piling up and the rainy season looming, I don't have the time to spend on a warranty return. It's possible that this motor failure is a rarity, but I'm thinking I'll try Toro next, and will buy locally."
2,"Not much black pepper, poor texture.","There didn't seem to be a lot of black pepper on this, almost on par with some traditionally flavored jerky. The texture was tough and the cuts were very thin.Very odd, of the 4 Buffalo Bills flavors I ordered this is the only one that wasn't awesome. Perhaps it was from a not so great batch? Anyhow, I would avoid this one in preference of other varieties."
3,Mixed feelings,"I'm not sure what to make of this jerky. It's incredibly sweet, and upsets my stomach a little bit. A little cloying I suppose. I feel like it could use more pepper to help cut through that a bit. Not as good as the sweet n spicy flavor that buffalo bill's also offers."
1,elec timer,i am unhappy with timer..i feel that enough info was presented when i decide to purchase it..i sold it to an other party and took a loss in the process..it was also overpriced..i would have done better in rodio shack
3,Not what I expected ...,"Be advised: this is a small, very thin (flimsy even), plastic-y ""mousepad"". Best for travel as it fits nicely in a laptop bag/backpack. I do however like the marbled, purple design, hence the 3 star review."
3,Some Good Tracks On Here...but,"My real gripe with this cd is that it is not mixed. Original Nuttah, Blow Out Jungle VIP, and Vibes are the hottest tunes on this cd.. All the other tracks are marginally allright."
4,Takes Me Back!,"This CD provides a fundamental lesson in the earlier history of breakbeat. When Shy FX's ""Original Nuttah"" was released in August of 94 it was one of the hottest records on the scene. This track alone takes you back to the early days of yelling ""REWIND!!"".. and really set the mark for the evolution of Ragga-Jungle. If you buy this CD at all.. but it for the first track!"
3,"This is a great field guide, but this copy is not as described in the description","I have an old copy of this book (original 1997 printing) that is waterproof and included a waterproof fish-viewing bag. This new copy (3rd printing) I just ordered from Amazon is written on glossy non-waterproof paper and doesn't include the fish viewing bag. I never would have ordered this copy if I knew it wasn't waterproof as I intend to take it into the field. Anyway, this is going back to Amazon and I'm going to look for an original waterproof copy."
2,This book only features rough sketches...,"Look closely at the cover of this book. It is filled only with such rough sketches of the day, evening, and sports wear from this decade. This is not a detailed, pattern-oriented fashion book. Rather, it serves better as a quick reference guide for a designer looking for inspiration from classic styles."
4,Great costume resource,"I always turn to John Peacock books when I want an overview of a decade for a costuming project. This one was a lot of help, as usual, for a general reference for a project set in 1934."
2,It's ok.,"If you are buying this book it is probably because you have to as it has been assigned as a text book for a course you are taking.First of all, chapter 9 on epistemology and ontology is extremely poorly written. Too much crammed in to one chapter means they lack explanatory language and you learn very little. Also why is a chapter on ontology and epistemology chapter 9? You'd think it would be at the beginning of the book.Secondly - the amount of spelling and grammatical errors is embarrassing. It is hard to take a book on political science seriously when all I see are amateur spelling and grammatical inconsistencies. Very poor!Other than that, ok book. Have read better on this subject."
5,"Great Kit, Great Price",I purchased this together with the Dremel DuoDremel 1130-01 120V 7.2V Screwdriver / Stylus ComboIt really completes the Duo Kit and provides most if not all of the rotary bits the average rotary tool user will need and provides them in a great case.Not much else to say on it. 5 Stars.
5,Perfect accessory for Dremel. Perfect price.,Pretty much everything you need to get value out of your Dremel tool. Can't beat the price either!
4,My dremel with too much too use,"AWESESOME FOR PRICE,but what is everything for,no manual for woman thats idiot.A man would love this in my opinion. Saves alot of money also..YEah!!!"
1,DOES NOT COME WITH THE DRILL!,"As you read the contents of the advertisement you could very well come away thinking that the ""drill"" comes with the set. WRONG!!! This set just contains a great majority of grinding wheels and that's where most of the ""150"" consists of. Save your money. A very big disappointment to me."
4,Not a bad deal,"This is a great startup kit for a new rotary tool user. The case is okay, but large for the number of pieces included. There are way to many cutting discs and sanding drums in proportion to every thing else included. I dropped a cutting disc from less than a foot and it shattered so maybe it is good to have a bunch of them, but for what it's worth, the second cutting disc did not break after being attached to the tool and cutting metal. Overall, good startup deal."
2,Misleading,States:The lawn mower and garden tool sharpener is also included for easy sharpening of your lawn and garden tools.The lawn mower sharpening attachment is not included. It only includes the grinding stone.
4,I like to keep it short,An excellent expansion...on the accessories contained in a stock dremel kit.Points of interest:Large quantity of cutting/sanding/grinding wheelsSOME very useful individual pieces.Points of contention:Part count includes many multiples of the same items. Im not so sure that everybody needs 3 dozen sanding discs.it would be nice if some of the more robust cutter accessories were included.oh god the case! what a poor use of space! luckily the part trays can be removed. eventually i shall relocate them.
4,Dremel Accessories,I am a DIY and this product is just the right one for some of the things that I have to do around the house
5,Great offer for great price!,"Amazing kit for amazing price, I'd only like to see more reinforced cut-off discs included, instead of general ones."
2,Only one cutter,"This set consists entirely of abrasives, except for a single small cutting bit and one drill bit. It is only worth purchasing if you are looking for adding to your supply of abrasives or replacement arbors for your abrasives."
5,"No more ""pawdicures""!","Dinah our Corgidor is a real drama queen when it comes time to get her nails clipped. Unforrtunately she has been nicked on numerous occassions and she doesn't forget. The dremel tool is the perfect solution! She will sit and let us file down her nails, with no fuss! Thank you for the answer to this problem....we have a much happier dog and less Vet expesne for Pawdicures!!"
5,Inspiring easy step by step,Mr. Schiffman's book made so much sense to me. It is a real (for a change) guide to finding and closing sales and other business deals. I found it informative and refreshing with so many new and old strategies that I need for my career. It was well written and it inspired me. I do think some of his ideas will change the way I deal with perspective and new clients.
1,not happy,I was misled by the advertising on this product as they are not safe for cell phones.. in fact they bubbled up my cell phone face
3,A bit too difficult for young children,"Though the book is well intentioned and provides good ideas of what to do when a parent is away, the text is lengthy and a bit difficult for young children."
5,"Trace Adkins IS ""Comin On Strong""","Trace Adkins has a hit with this cd of beautiful songs.From the fun Hot Mama to the deep emotions of Missing You, it's all Trace Adkins at his best.This album is a must have for everyone."
5,Trace Adkins is Comin' on Strong!!!,Since December 2nd this cd has been the only cd in my car.I would highly recommend that anyone who doesn't have it should run (NOT WALK!)to their nearest music store. While you are there grab his other 4 cds if you haven't already.
5,best one yet,"Trace Adkins has really out done himself! All the songs on the cd are awesome! True Country at its best! Love all of the songs but Hot Mama, Coming on Strong and Then Came the Night are the best! Great job Trace!"
5,In LOVE with Trace Adkins!!!!!!,Trace Adkins is by far one of the best country music stars I have ever heard! His new album is on the cutting edge of risky vs. sensuous and he has the voice to bring it all together to give us spine tingling chills as we listen to his sultry crooning! Hot Mama nearly sizzles through the speakers! I feel as if he has given us that ever coveted look into his private thoughts and life with his new lyrics. I LOVE this album and Trace just keeps getting better and better and better and better.....
4,Comin' On Strong,"That cocky smile he has that can melt a woman's heart is evident thru out the CD packaging and on the CD cover. You can almost hear it in some of the songs as you listen to the tracks. Two of Trace's latest hits are featured on the CD, Red Hot Mama, along with Rough & Ready. They are the first and last songs on the CD, but the songs in between are worth listening too also."
5,Better than ever!,This CD comes on like a rocket. Every song leaves you wanting more. This is Trace's best work ever. The songs go back to original sounding Trace Adkins. Great follow up to his Greatest Hits.
5,ONE HOT TRACE,"Just when you think Trace Adkins' music can't get any better, it dones. He has really outdone himself in this new CD. It's full of music that is pleasing to the ears and songs that will drive you wild! His voice is strong and confident as he belts out everyone of the 11 great new songs. I listen to one song and think ""that's my favorite"", then the next song comes on and I think ""no, that's my favorite"". If I had to pick one favorite, I'd say EVERY ONE. Buy this CD, you won't regret it. You'll become a Trace fan before you realize it! GREAT JOB, TRACE!!!!"
4,COMING ON STRONG,"This cd is awesome. Trace's best one yet, DEFINATELY a must have to anyones cd collection."
5,Hold On!,"You will need to hold on because ""Comin' On Strong"" takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. ""Hot Mama"" shoots you right up to the top, while ""Comin' On Strong"" is the smoothest rolling song you've ever heard. While other tunes will dip you up and down, ""Rough and Ready"" will bring you to a screaching halt at the end of your ride and leave you ready to jump on the ride again and again."
4,Not too bad,"It is hard to give this one anything more than 4 stars because I own and love volume 1 of the Psychotrance series; volume 1 is the best, but we are here to review volume 2! :PSo, the music on this seems a bit sterile and passionless to some extent. But that is what makes it attractive to me. Just like your mood for certain types of food change, you may sometimes find yourself in the mood for music that is not too intrusive.That said, it still rocks in a not-so-obvious way - the songs ""Touchdown"" and ""Music Was Sent"" and the transition between them are great; later on, ""Recognised"" and the subtle TB-303 sounds of ""Artech"" stand out as peaks on the waves of this album. Should you buy this album? I say you should, especially if you can pick it up for around $8.00. Its great for those times when you just want some good background music that will not demand your attention."
3,Moonlight Sonata incredible.,"The recording of this -- if we believe Mr Drake -- was produced when Horowitz was at the peak of his power. His personal life and battle with depression took its toll on his later recordings (post-1980). This remains a monument to the master. Sound quality is a bit airy, which also seems to be explained by Mr. Drake."
5,Powerful little beast,"I received this innocent-looking chainsaw together with a Mini-Mill.I cut a couple of 10"" hard maple logs into beautiful spalted boards last Sunday and I was a bit afraid about the strain on this saw but it cut beautifully, never bogging down once in the heavy rip cuts.If you don't like the mess and the hassle of a gas-powered chainsaw, this is one sweet little deal.Please don't forget to buy bar oil and grease to lubricate before the first use."
4,Chain Saws,"More power than the previous 16"" model.Chain seems to come off too often. Otherwise a good product at a good price."
2,"Great Shorts............., But","These shorts are very comfortable. Lots of pockets, Good length. Only problem is that the second time I zipped them up, the zipper teeth fell off in bunches. Now what am I supposed to do?"
5,Easily installed and keeps Hi-Lift out of the way,"I have the large 60"" Hi-Lift jack and need to store it in the bed of my little Nissan Pickup. I have the Hi-Lift on the inside wall of my bed, and this mounting system is perfect for that!"
3,make sure you have room to mount the jack its huge,hard to find good surface to mount jack on f150 jeeps are much better. Maybe i should buy a jeep to fit my fancy new jack mounts.
2,Just A Taste Of Popcorn,The paintings contained in this book are truly excellent. The fact is there are too few to really justify a whole book. Having seen another hundred fine examples of theaters in this country I am dismayed that so few are represented. The book leaves me longing for more . I wish the artist had included some of the fine interior spaces of these deco palaces. If you love theaters buy this book but also take the time to visit one in your area for the full experience.
5,A fresh new-old outlook,"C. Roy Angell is making a comeback at a time when we need his experiences and insights. He shares stories to use in teaching and in illustrating situations. Yes, it is a walk in sunshine instead of a walk in the gutters of life. Good to read some thing that is not jaded by the cynicism of our time."
2,it's okey but not unique or outstanding,"This is blues based heavy metal with a lot of southern boogie rock, delivered by a band with a rough sounding singer. If you like Lynch Mob's ""Wicked sensation"" and Shortino's ""It's about time"", the chances are rather big that you'll also like this one."
5,Anatomy and Pathology for Bodyworkers,"Loved itI am a massage therapist who wanted to refresh my anatomy and system knowledge. The great graphics made this DVD easy to learn from, and entertaining to watch. It was good to have the pathology section, since it reinforced how the information about the systems relates to working on people with problems."
3,Ok For review,"This is an OK DVD for a quick general review, but lacks the depth needed for each system. Hey what do expect to get in 74 minutes of anatomy and pathology."
1,Waste of money,"When you only have about 5 minutes to cover the nervous system, dumbing it down (not even a description of the parts of the neuron) to include massage strokes and pathologies within that 5 minute framework, it's just ridiculous. The imagery is great - but I don't think I'd have bought it just for that. I wanted more meat on this one, but was disappointed.For the bodyworker, maybe it's simple review, but I hope their knowledge of anatomy and physiology sure isn't limited to this dvd. Better off reading your books and viewing individual system videos on youtube..."
3,excuse me!!,"the guy who wrote the first review has absolutely no taste for good house music!!, ok many of the songs are no top productions, but people who don't like the stuff here from Roger Sanchez,Arnold Jarvis & People Underground(masters at work), have to really check their mental doctor!!"
1,anything to make a buck,The only thing this Cd does is tries to get your dollar. If you want good house check out something well mixed by a DJ who makes a living mixing House music. At no point did I even finish a track on here. I just skipped to the next and next hoping that this thing would soon produce something good. Sadly to say it didn't.
1,Don't bother....,"I have loved watching Sam Elliot in the Louis Lamour stories made into movies. I thought that was what I was getting, I should have read the reviews.... It was awful, foul language, immorality, nudity, no real story line and no real ending.So disappointed....don't bother...."
3,Another good Sam Elliot western,"Even in modern times the battered wife has had trouble.Here Linda Fiorentino plays the battered wife of a Marshal's son,who finally defends herself with deadly force.We find them on a stage going back to where she will be hanged.Love is sometimes found in unexpected places.It seems strange to have the usual hero as the villain and alsoa law man?I really didn't believe the story lineas the love seems a little sudden to be that strong?This movie doesn't end well for anybody."
3,A Western 'Noir' That's A Bit Different,"This western starts out very well, then gets too Rambo-ish, meaning the bad guys can't hit the side of a barn with their shots. Despite that credibility problem, it's a pretty good film with excellent sound, nice cinematography and some interesting special-effects. The soundtrack also is different. Speaking of sound, I was disappointed to hear an excessive amount of Lord's name in vain in here.Actually, this is a modern-day film noir put in a western setting.Edgy characters played by Sam Elliott (the ultimate cowboy face), Craig Sheffer, Linda Fiorentino (hard-nosed, as always), Bradford Whitford and Frank Whalley dominate the film. This is not a movie with a lot of good guys. It may be too edgy for many, especially those (and I'm one) who prefer Elliott to play nicer characters."
3,Worth seeing but don't expect anything special,Desperate Trail is a decent film but nothing really amazing.The story is fairly strait-forward with nothing truly origional but decent. Unfortunatly the characters could use some work. None are particularly well-developed or interesting. Scheffer and Forientino are both rather flat leaving Eliot with the only strong performance and his character really should have gotten more screen time.The action sequences are generally well done with a good use of slow motion and editing. What really pumps up the scenes is the excellent soundtrack. They aren't masterfully done but are exciting enough to warrent seeing the movie.Desperate Trail is a competent western but nothing revolutionary.
2,Sam has done much better,"Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See ""The Sacketts', ""Conagher"", ""The Shadow Riders"", or ""The Quick and the Dead"". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed."
1,Canon ZR200 very bad tape problems,The tape would not work after only using it a few times. The camera was never droped always kept in a case when not filming. Will only work now with the card. Customer support is non-existant. Will never buy a canon camcorder again. Canon should stick to still cameras only.
2,Deceptive Product,"I would still say that it is a good product while it lasts. The problem with this is that you never know when your cassette will stuck inside and never come out; and then that's the end of life of this product. You would rather spend hard-earned money on something that has a better dependability. It may die just when you need it most and without any warning, seriously!"
2,"Good camera, but not the one I ordered","The camera arrived in good shape and seems to work well. I haven't had much time to spend with it yet. The disappointments were that it was not the model I ordered, therefore none of my accessories that I already had fit. Also, it did not come with an instruction manual, nor some of the cords needed to do everything. In fact it even came with a wrong cord that doesn't fit it."
1,Ejection problems have killed this camera -- and apparently many others,"We bought this camera a little over a year ago but have rarely used it. However, just when I need it the most to capture a family event, the camera starts beeping and tells me that the tape must be ejected. So I tried to eject it, but it did not eject. Moved maybe a millimeter then moved back. I don't think we put more than several hours of use on this thing and it broke. Very unhappy.Spoke to tech support, but they didn't offer up anything but disconnecting all power and waiting an hour to start it up again. Didn't work. Have a suspicion that the hour I waited was the hour that tech support closed. Repairs will cost as much as buying a new one. So buying a new one we will, just not a Canon.Still very, very, unhappy."
5,awsome packaged simple 2 input switch,this switch has really simplified my TV arrangement. I have had to manually re cable my TV input on a daily basisswitching between satellite/dvr and antenna for local stations. Wow has this simplified it. with a quick push of a button. switch is solid and laid out nice. comes with mounting screws plus an adhesive pad to stick it somewhere.also Parts Express International Inc.processed and shipped super fast.I recommend.
3,Good useful information but expensive for what you get.,Good book. But the content is sort of light. National Geographic Photography Field Guide - Secrets to making great picture would get you more information and better improve your skill for a similar price.
1,Not worth it,I bought this yardman snow thrower and got one good year out of it. After that all I had were problems with it getting started and working for longer than 5 minutes. It start and stop repeatedly. Don't waste your money on this blower.
4,"Works, but not meant for powered splitter boxes","This cable works as advertised and does make a good extender. I noticed some ghosting on HDTV(most likely due to the thinness of the cable) but works fine on small monitor.Be aware that this does not make a good Male to Female VGA cable for powered splitter. I purchased this for theCables To Go - 29550 - 2-Port UXGA Video Splitter Extenderthat requires a Female to Male VGA cable and this was listed under the 'frequently bought together' section. I later found that the screw connectors don't match the splitter box and the cable cant be plugged into the splitter box.Again, good extension cable but don't buy if you are using this for splitter boxes. What you need is10ft Hi Resolution monitor cable (Male to Female)--see the difference in the screw connections."
5,Works perfectly for me,"There's really not much to review here -- it's an extension cord for your monitor cable. It works. It's the kind of item that you don't think about much unless it doesn't work, which may explain the very few reviews. It allowed me to reposition my monitor where I wanted it and -- best of all -- it was a fraction of the cost of a simliar item at Radio Shack."
5,Hot Summer Magic,"Summer Magic was just that MAGIC. Caryn needing a place to find solitude after a bad marriage was just the prescription she needed. But, she wasn't counting on sharing a house with a dream man called Logan. Now Logan is looking for a place to hide to come to terms after finding his bride to be fanning the sheets with his friend and best man. Now he never told his bride to be why he was breaking off the marriage. Both Caryn and Logan know the couple who rents their house to them for the summer, but the couple fails to tell them that they will have company. Caryn,puts a wall up to not let any man in, but her wall is slowly crumpling until that magic night they made love. She never thought a man could love her so tenderly as Logan did and Logan never thought that a woman can give so much passion. I highly recommed this book. It took me just 2 hours to read. Since reading I have re-read the last 2 chapters over again. This is a must for your collection."
5,What a Man that Logan Prescott!,"This was my very first book by Alers and it was off the chain. ""Summer Magic"" is my second favorite book of all times. It was all of that. The plot for the story was great along with the setting. And the characters!! Logan is very close to being ever woman's dream, talk about dreamy!! I tell you that Caryn was a very lucky lady to have a man like Logan's attention on her only. I loved thier story! It would be great to hear an update on Caryn and Logan along with Cynthia and Ham in other book! Much love Alwe!"
4,Off the chain,"I didn't give it 5 stars, but I was debating it.I am from NYC and a true house head and believe me when I say this triple CD is well worth it.Just like MAW Soul Heaven Defected in the house, this CD takes you on a musical journey.MAW Defected didn't get great reviews, because the people that rated it were idiots and don't even know true house music.I REMEMBER WHEN HOUSE MUSIC WAS SOUL MUSIC & RnB."
1,Poorly Done,"I was Sorry I even BOUGHT this.There were only 3 songs that I really liked. It started off great w/ the first song then tunred terrible fast. The 2 best tracks easily were the Fantastic Track by Natalie Cole ""tell me about it"", and the Timeless Classic, ""club Lonely"" by Lil Louis(one of my all-time personal favorites).Aside from these two great tracks, there wasnt much to Evissa '04."
1,don't waste your money,"They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth.Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out."
1,worthless,Save your money. These cleaning wipes left streaks all over my monitor. A complete waste of money. The monitor looks worse than before.I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.Do NOT wast your money.
1,Am I missing something here???,It's like wiping your monitor off with WD40. Somebodygoofed on these. Not sure what I can use these things fornow. Yes I know I'm from Alabama and a degree fromthe U of A but I need more instructions or a differentbrand.
2,Not too great.,These actually left my screen dirtier than I started with. It left behind annoying streaks and film which I ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution. I suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy; it's cheaper and more effective.
4,Good product,"I give it 4 stars because it clears my screen well. it leavs a little bit of residue but if you clean it till the napkin is dry, you are good. it also if a lot of wipes for a little bit of money so if you need to clean your laptop this is a good product"
1,Streaks,"The side of the tube says ""No Streaks Guaranteed,"" but it left streaks all over my monitor. I contacted the manufacturer, but haven't heard anything back from them. Don't buy this product to clean your screen."
4,Computer Wipes,"The wipes work pretty well except that they are hard to get through the opening so they can be pulled out. Otherwise, they work really well."
2,Streaks,"These wipes did rid my LCD of most of the dirt on it; however, each wipe left behind distracting streaks. Although the streaks aren't always visible, they are definitely nuisance enough to leave me dissatisfied with the product."
1,Total Disappointment,"This is the first time I am dissapointed in an Amazon Product, not only is it impossible to get these wipes to dispense propperly, They streaked my screen and left lint behind"
1,Container design flawed- wipes dried out in a matter of weeks.,"I bought these and the competing ""3M Electronic Equipment Cleaning Wipes"" at the same time for my IT shop.-These wipes dried out shortly after opening the canister. Not just the next wipe in line but, even the wipes inside the canister.-The competing 3M product mentioned earlier is great, though. Both of the canisters were opened at the same time and stored in the same cabinet. One of the products is completely useless, the other is going strong.The product is probably fine, it's the packaging that makes it worthless."
2,No Good,"These wipes dried out before I used half of them. Before they dried out, they left a film on my laptop screen when I used them. And the single-sheet dispenser top was too tight - the wipe I grabbed tore off at the perforation with the next wipe without pulling the corner of the next wipe out. Consequently, I had to pull off the top every time I wanted another wipe. This may explain why they dried out (although I did replace the top every time)."
3,Oops... missed the Deadline?,"Hmm, did r.u. and jude miss the dealine on this one aswell. With the text below the title, ""An Exploded Post-Novel"", it can certainly make you wonder. The style is definitly wired, a precurser to english usage in the digital age. a cybercultural tomb of email babble. more so that most other books, i feel that 'how to mutate and take over the world' would really depend on what the reader goes into the book for. for my purposes of 'technology/culture' research, it proves an excellent resource. aesthetically, the book is quite beatiful; a variety of topography, a catchy semi-translucent cover-sleeve, the digitally altered photograph of an anonymous head on the cover, etc. etc.. if your into the whole ""cypherpunk"" ordeal, this book will look good next to your 'techgnosis'..."
3,Historical meta-document,"This is St. Jude on Zoloft collaborating with RU Sirius to craft a terribly drole chronicle/send up of SanFran's cyberpunk climate in the mid-90's. If you didn't track the culture, you miss a lot of the references, unfortunately, so it has to be viewed as an extended series of inside jokes on a vanished movement."
4,great organizer for a busy mom,"Although the other reviewer complained about the limited questions, as a very busy mom of three and a teacher myself, I found that it has enough information to give you a brief glimps at their school life. I didn't really expect this to have a place for family vactions or birthday parties. After all it is a scrapbook for SCHOOL. I also love the big pockets, plenty of room to store snapshops, artwork, awards, and report cards. However, I only paid (...) each for my three books through someone who was selling books out of a catalog at school a few years ago. I was shocked that the on-line price was $25.00!I have made adjustments to the cover of the book (mine is the blue and red one with all twelve years) since there is no place for a kindergarten picture. I used the 1st grade spot for the kindergarten picture, the 2nd grade spot for the 1st grade picture, etc. and am saving the center for the senior portrait."
1,"Cheap, Flimsy, Memory Book","I was very disappointed when I opened this Memory Keeper School Days book.I cannot believe the price they are charging for this cheaply constructed book. It looked and felt as if it were just glued together and seemed if it were opened and closed too many times it would just fall apart.If I had seen this in the store I would not have even paid $10 for it, let alone almost $30 including s&h.; This is not worth the money at all. I purchased one of these several years ago and paid LESS and it went from Pre-school to 12th grade and had beautiful pocket folders and pictures it it and was very strongly bound together. I thought this would be similar but not even close."
2,School Memories,"I was disappointed with the book I received because it was not the same as the picture shown on the website. It was the same name, however the actual book was not the same. It's deceiving to order what is shown and actually get something different."
2,not what I expected,"I was very disapointed in this book especially since it is one of the more expensive School memory books. There are only 2 pages per grade and the questions are very narrow. No place for information on birthday parties, family trps, etc. While the pockets are nice, there is not enough space for other information about the child. I will be returning this."
1,I can't believe this is being sold for more than $25,I purchased this book 8 years ago for $25. $25 was a super price for the book. You should not pay more than that because the binding falls apart the more years you use it.
5,Perhaps the best discussion of Darwinism yet,"This is definitely THE book to give friends, students and even enemies who are interested in the theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Ernst Mayr, one of the foremost architects of our understanding of the ecological nature of evolution draws on his immense scholarship to bring us a highly readable text on the many facets of Darwinism. I have given this book to graduate and undergraduate students, we have fought over it in seminars, and in general it holds a premier place in the library pf anyone with a genuine interest in understanding one of the key elements of modern biology."
4,Excellent,"I don't know if one person is allowed to submit more than one review of the same CD, but seeing as it's been five months since my previous commentary and no one else has written anything, I have more to add:The reading of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" in particular is a masterpiece. Most readings of that particular story I have heard are either underdone or overdone, but this one is medium RARE. Perfectly done! Every little vocal inflection by the reader was inexpressably PERFECT!! Every little tiny morsel from his voicebox is a treat to the ears. Poe's masterpiece combined with the reader's equally powerful reading make that particular story the definitive reading of it in the 150-odd years since it was written. Absolutely amazing!"
3,GOOD FOR A FIRST EFFORT,"Wasn't too bad. With all that history has to offer though, far more ""incidents"" could've been investigated. Who really shot JFK? Did man really land on the moon? Who stole the Beaumont Children? Who was the Wanda Beach murderer? Did the dingo really do it?"
3,Disappointed,"Loved the concept, but it lost me with the constant and dry ""cut and paste"" historical background sections for each time adventure. I found myself constantly skipping over sections of several pages just to get on with the story.Also, the ending was like the creative tap was just turned off.Afterward, I dropped the book off at a thrift store instead of adding it to my collection as usual (over 3,000 and still growing)."
2,"Almost, but not quite","It read a bit more like a cliff notes for a history book. This was a great premise for a book, but they never came to ultimate fruition. Lee had some great ideas, but it seemed like he didn't know how to get the book there."
4,"Overall, pretty good effort","The Interesting concept of the novel had me hooked enough to ensure I read this in a few days. It was an enjoyable, albeit sometimes flawed, romp through history.First up, English and British are 2 very different entities. The author ignores this concept and you risk alienating all non-English Brits.Secondly, the deus ex machina to wrap up the novel was a little trite. It all seemed a little too easy to stop the mass maurder of so many people.Other than that, however, it was a novel that contained a whole bunch of things I like (history, time travel, geography etc). A decent effort.Tony Hughes is the author of the internationally unpopular and time camera-free novel 'From Fear to Flattery'."
5,History in a Flash,"Well Done Mr Lee.This story takes you on a thrilling ride, through the lens of the Time Camera.Great characters, especially Zak, takes the reader with them whilst they view history's greatest moments and then the events which seem to almost spiral out of control as a result.History with a twist..what will happen next?"
5,Great ideas provided,"I have been practicing massage almost 2 years. Im just getting into hot stone, I have seen other videos, and liked this one the best. It gives more than hot stone, also a briefing on cold stone, and also hot stone on the meridians. I liked her explaination of the hot stone, and also the healing purpose of the few different meridians were helpful, and the stone layouts for each of the maridian. This gave me some ideas for my business. I thought it was helpful."
2,Hmm...,"First, may I say I am a fan and supporter of Mr. Riehl's work; he's not only a fantastic therapist but his instructional films in the past are worthy of repeated viewings.This DVD unfortunately does not fit the same mold.If one wants to learn a general hot stone massage sequence to fill in for a friend at the day spa, this DVD will provide what you're looking for.However, I feel it's fair to state it's not well-filmed, and the woman is a therapist, NOT a good speaker/performer.All in all, a little more film on the cutting room floor and a bit more research should have been done before shrink-wrapping this Hot Stone Massage Comedy."
2,Superstition,"Hot or cold stones may produce a mildly pleasurable feeling for some people. If, however, you believe that placing inert stones on the body can actually HEAL, you are wide open to all varieties of quackery."
5,Shooting at the Moon is on the Mark!,"Shooting at the Moon is the great image Roger Warner employs to shed light on the USA strategy in Laos and perhaps for all of Southeast Asia. With literary aplomb, Warner brings to life many of the key figures in the CIA 's covert attempt to level the playing field in Laos as the overt war raged in Vietnam. The incredible shift from a small operation to a technically air dependent approach in the context of global political strategy, set up the Hmong people, our allies, for inevitable genocide. Warner succeeds in placing the reader inside Laos in its last days of glory as ""The Land of a Million Elephants and a Parasol."" In the end, shooting at the moon eclipses the sincere efforts of a handful of people to stave off the darks days in Laos following the communist takeover."
5,MR. AND MRS. ELLIOTT SHINE IN L'AMOUR CLASSIC,"While Sam Elliott has become (along with, perhaps, Tom Selleck) the personification of the Louis L'Amour screen hero, it's especially nice in CONAGHER to see him opposite one of the first ladies of western cinema, Katherine Ross. It's especially nice when one remembers that Ms. Ross is also Mrs. Elliott in real life.The two provide a power-packed performance in bringing Louis L'Amour's classic western tale to life. CONAGHER is the story of an honorable cowhand who almost single-handedly takes on a gang of marauders bent on doing all the damage they can to everyone they meet. Yes, a classic battle of good against evil ensues but it's done sincerely and lacks some of the schmaltz that surfaces in similar western sagas.Add to Elliott and Ross an all-star western cast including Dub and Buck Taylor, Barry Corbin and Ken Curtis and you have an enduring western classic.THE HORSEMAN"
5,Conagher,I love Sam Elliott movies and this is one of his great worksThis is a true cowboy movie and a wonderful love story forthose who have a romantic streak. Great family viewing.
2,"Sorry, But It's Pretty Much A Snooze Fest.","I love Westerns and I love Sam Elliott. I also don't demand that movies have a lightning pace. But all that said, this was a desperately dull film. It simply lurched from one scene to another with hardly a plot to speak of, and unfortunately the overall solid (but unfortunately wasted) cast isn't able to rise above the material. Uninteresting characters plus a complete lack of narrative focus makes for one of the most surprisingly boring Westerns I've ever seen. If you want to see much better examples of Sam Elliott doing Loius L'Amour, check out 'The Sacketts,' 'The Shadow Riders,' and 'The Quick and the Dead.' None of those films rank among the better Westerns ever made either, but they're miles ahead of 'Conagher.'"
2,Not as exciting as other Sam Elliott fare,"I bought Conagher I will admit only because Sam Elliott is in it. I had great expectations of it because I'm such an Elliott enthusiast, but I was disappointed. I found this film too long and boring and not nearly as engaging as The Quick and The Dead. In my opinion, Sam even had more chemistry with Kate Capshaw in The Quick and the Dead than he did with his real wife Kathryn Ross in Conagher. Of course, I enjoyed seeing Sam, but I was bored and restless and was glad when the movie ended. This is not a reflection on Sam, whom I find most appealing and engaging, but the film was just too boring."
5,Conagher,"Anything with Sam Elliot in it is bound to be a favorite for me! My Dad was a great Louis L'Amour fan, and we watched Conagher together. Dad is gone now, and I remember him by enjoying this movie again!"
5,Louis L Amor and Sam Elliot are a great team!,I have had this movie on VHS for quite some time andjust recently purchased the DVD. This movie tells a great story while revealing L Amor's view of the range cowboys morality. There simply are not enough good westerns being made anymore. This is a great western. I would highly recomend any western that is derived from a Louis L Amor novel.
4,Very good made for cable western,"Katherine Ross and Sam Elliot both did a great job in this quiet, elegiac western. With Barry Corbin as a stagecoach driver and Ken Curtis (who played Festus on ""Gunsmoke"") this has a sort of ""let's-the-get-the-gang-together-and-make-a-western"" feel to it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's full of good, wholesome values--an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, don't steal, don't kill unless you absolutely must--and middle-American common sense and courage.There are some drawbacks, however. First, this was a made for TV movie, and the commercial breaks are as obvious as in any TV show (although there are no commercials on the DVD). Also, it was shot full frame, and the print this DVD was mastered from was not pristine. But for what it is, it is very good."
3,Great Story,"Was made for TV. This DVD was very dark, not very good quality. I had it the first time in VHS. I have seen this move several times. Love Sam Elliott"
4,"looks, feels solid","Got the grey/blue one, but with plastic plate as shown in the non-blue photo. Fit & finish look good. Despite the plastic on it, feels way more solid than I was expecting in something so cheap, has some actual heft to it. Appreciate that it has its own little case with it. No instructions, took a little to figure out the little tool that comes with it, for re-zeroing it, apparently, which I then proceeded to do (wasn't much off to begin with, but I wanted to play with it). Action seems smooth enough. Haven't quite mastered the use of the vernier scale- could be the instrument but might be me- looks easy enough to use down to the closest .001 at least- good enough for its intended purpose as a cheap brake rotor measure. For the price & intended casual use I'm happy so far."
4,A good beginner reading book,"This is a colorful, sparkling beginner level reading book for preschool and Kindergarten readers."
3,noisy industriel,"Decree can described as an extreme scheme of Dive, Brighter Death Now and SPK. ""Wake of Devastation"" contains metallic hammering, noisy industrial sounds and shouts."
4,Teddy Roosevelt Cleans Up Crime in Old New York,"Commissioner Roosevelt is a great account of Theodore Roosevelt's tenure as New York City Police Commission President. As the head of the three-person board that oversaw the city's police, Roosevelt changed our notion of a modern police department. Even as he attempted to institute reforms he faced down police corruption, ethnic-group protests, government foot-dragging, and machine politics in the land of Tamany Hall. This firebrand commissioner would even prowl the gaslighted streets of Old New York looking for policemen asleep at their posts.Join Theodore Roosevelt in this crusade to stop crime and corruption in New York. If you enjoyed Caleb Carr's fictional T.R. in The Alienist, you'll probably enjoy the real life crime-buster in Commissioner Roosevelt. (I liked Mr. Jeffers' real one better.) Anyone interested in politics, especially New York or ethnic politics, might like it too."
2,"A readable biography, but rather superficial","I read this book after having read Jay S. Berman's Police Administration and Progressive Reform, which was written several years earlier. This is interesting, because Jeffer writes that his was the first book on this subject, despite the fact that he cites Berman in his bibliography and proceeds to cover the same ground. Jeffers book is readable but is shallow and superficial, consisting largely of anecdotes and summaries of newspaper accounts from the New York Times. Berman's book is far more scholarly and vastly better researched. Jeffers owes an apology to both his predecessor and his readers for claiming to have written a book that ""needed to be written""."
3,Average Metzger fare,"A Suspicious Affair and An Angel for the Earl are both amusing and relatively entertaining, the second entry being the better of the two. ""Angel"" is innovative and the lead couple likeable and fairly well rounded. Metzger's typical humor is in force in both works, though perhaps more so in the first. While the puns are sometimes trite, the word play and mental twists usually work. The problem with ""Affair"" is that both leads are unpleasant for quite some time and the sudden declaration is not wholly believeable. Both can drag when Metzger's exposition lengthens.This book combines two average Metzger novels. Thus, while diverting, it's not going to account for any money spent on my part."
3,A little boring,This Dvd did not hold my kids(4yrs & 1 1/2yrs) attention. After watching it for 3 minutes they walked away. I have tried it several times and still the same response. The funny thing is I got the idea off of the cable channel(Comcast On Demand) and the kids loved it. I realize that is because on the cable channel they showed the best parts and that is the singing(great songs) but the story is boring and to long before you get to the singing. I will keep trying it as they get older. The animation is very colorful with great looking charactors. The story might be a little to mature for them at this age.
2,Not very functional,"I expected this to have a good solid clip at the top that would hold paper securely. It doesn't; the clip is marginally functional and not at all of the quality I had expected. It's useable, but frustrating, and I would not get this again."
3,A little lighter,"then Epson branded cartridges, but for the money and if you're not printing something critical, you just cannot beat these!"
4,Great Deal,I originally bought this book for my class at the school bookstore. It was over a hundred dollars but this was such a great find. It came a week before the latest delivery time and the seller sent it out really quickly and punctually. I would buy from this seller again.
3,Kilkenny's finest under review,"~Standunder is a super album from Kilkenny, Ireland's finest band My Little Funhouse. While the album can't hold a candle to their classic gigs supporting Guns and Roses in Slane Castle and in the Pumphouse, Standunder goes some way to capture some of that magic. The album is a solid affair, packed with strong guitar rifts and soaked in a grungy vibe. Alan Lawlor's vocals are terrific with a voice reminiscent of a rockier Adam Duritz. The best track is the funky and downright dirty Cookie Jar~~ while the lamentable L.S.D. is the album's nadir. The tone of the album is very inconsistent and it's hard to tell if they're trying to tap into the grunge phase or make a straight out rocker album but there is plenty to recommend especially for fans of fast and catchy guitar choons. A good outing for Kilkenny's finest. Go on the cats.~"
3,3.5 stars - a solid glam/almost alternative rock album,"Here's an interesting album that totally slipped through the cracks in the early `90s. Irish rockers My Little Funhouse released their debut album Standunder in 1991, just as hair metal's popularity was fading and grunge's was rising. My Little Funhouse managed to sound like a mix of both styles, serving up bar rawking sleaze like L.A. Guns and grooving alternative like Jane's Addiction. Somehow they managed to sound dated and ahead of their time all at once.Standunder is actually a totally solid, totally rocking album. The songs are fairly well-written, they've got a great bar rock energy, and I dig the snarling, sleazy vocals. I'm much more into hair metal than alternative rock, so I'd have preferred more catchy hooks, but it's still a fun album. If you're a fan of early `90s rock and run across a cheap used copy (and you will, Standunder is a dollar bin regular), give My Little Funhouse a try."
5,Big deal...,I have been using my cordless rechargeable Dremel for nail jobs for about 15 years and it has always worked perfectly. I use attachments specifically made for nails and not the kind shown on the picture here. They look kind of unhygenic and non-professional.I am surprised that it took such a long time for Dremel to come up with the idea.Please note that I am neither a brain surgeon nor a nuclear scientist. It's plain common sense.
5,Tomcatt,"I collect animae and I've have this entire series, plus the Sakura series. I highly recommend this series, this realeace, it continues the cardcaptor series, in a cute form, that children can understand. Sometimes young children have a hard-time following or reading subtitled animaes like the sakura series. The sad thing about this series is that Pioneer, has cancelled out the rest of the series and there was 4 more left to be realeazed."
5,MY STARS!!!!!,"When my sister and me saw this video we instantly bought it! We LOOOOOOOOOOVE all cardcaptors things.[C] the first episode was great even though there wasn't much about Li.I'm a big fan of him and it's awfully satisfying to see him squirm, especially when he blushes around Sakura![oh, man I'm laughing right now!!].[K]actually, my sister was cracking up! [okay, i was satisfyied about Li's squirming too]. there's this new kid called Eli [C says he's twisted] and he's causing all these tests for Sakura. Eli actually seems to be in love with Sakura,[{C} YEAH RIGHT!] but not really. he actually wants Sakura and Li to get together[{C&K}heheheheheh!].[C&K] anyway, this DVD is great!! buy it and find out!"
5,book purchase review,"took a long time for package to get here and it was a cheap envelope with rips , but the book was great and here before the deadline but just took a little longer then others packages sent. great price. so I happy"
4,Not Bad For The Price,"The sound is pretty good, with nice enough bass, and clear enough high notes.The unit has problems with the reception at the high and low areas of the FM spectrum, with the stations near 88 and 105 and above not coming in very consistently.Otherwise, it works pretty well.The belt hook is o.k., but the arm band fell apart as I tried to put through the loops, making it useless.It's hard to beat this little radio for the price though, if you're willing to put up with the above inconveniences."
2,Digital Wins,this radio explains why analog was replaced by digital. the purpose of my buying this radio was to use it while running. big mistake. being that it's analog not digital the station is not locked in and every little movement takes the station off.
5,Best ROI in 2000!,"I purchased James Murphy's book in 2000, we just completed our financials and I am pleased to report that we doubled our revenues. We contribute this increase to a single statement we found in the book, Business is Combat. ""All of our resources in the Air Force are alligned like a shaft of a spear, pushing the ""pointy end forward"". We did that in our business and the results were dramatic. We have become great planners, we execute efficently and we now debrief, all of this we learned from Mr. Murphy's book. I keep it on my desk and refer to it often because it makes us money."
5,Excellent food storage cookbook,"Based on the principle of ""store what you eat and eat what you store,"" this book provides tasty recipes that use food storage basics such as beans, grains, etc. This book is oriented toward the LDS (Mormon) ""Word of Wisdom"" dietary code, but is a valuable book for non-LDS people who wish to eat healthy. It is not preachy or full of doctrine, although it does have a quote from the Word of Wisdom at the beginning of each section. (The quote is about what foods are good for humans to eat.)"
1,Wrong Image,"The image presented for The Mormon Diet Cookbook is not correct. It is the Mormon Diet. I wanted to buy the Mormon Diet Cookbook but, because the image is not correct, I don't know which book I'd be buying.The actual book, The Mormon Diet Cookbook has a lot of great recipes which are healthy and simple and that is why I want to buy."
5,guitar shreds all over the cutting room floor,"This Album Rips!Kind of a progressive grunge feel with thoughtful guitar shreds all over the cutting room floor. I know that that is not especially flattering sounding. But this album rocks. It never lets up, it's solid all the way though. Fans of Urge Overkill or Chavez will approve. A sleeper indy gem. Axel"
5,excellent -- a must for the casebook,best thing to read before class to brush up on cases or in time crunches!
3,Unknown Collection,"This album is rather dark and creepy for an ambient album. I purchased it for Granule: Withered in my Knapsack, but I have kept several other songs as well. Some were just too avant-garde and exploratory, so I removed those from my iTunes library. Most of these songs do not get radio play; probably because they are difficult to follow."
5,Hot!,"These are so beautiful! Well made, comfortable, and stylish. I've had a million and one people ask me where I got these from when I've worn them. And they're dirt cheap to boot! Trust me, you won't regret buying these."
2,I must be getting old!,"These arm warmers remind me of being a kid wearing leg warmers, thinking they were so cool. Oh man, the purpose???? Oh yeah, keeping your legs warm, NOT. I'm quite sure this arm fad is exactly that, a FAD. Have fun with it."
4,Steam Accesssories,This is a nice little book on steam toy accessories that kid would have in days gone by. I am interested in Steam models and wanted to see what used to be available. It is not a price guide or a complete catalog for the collector but a good sampling of toy steam toys.
4,The best Jungle I've heard yet!,"My reasoning for scoring Jungle Warfare 4 stars is because ofDJ Mickey Finn's mix. There are some *really* good tracks in it but there are a few *oopses* in his mix as well. And this may or may not be attributable to Finn's mix, but the last track by Trinity has it's left channel turned way down so it's as if the song is in mono--the flow of his mix is completely ruined for me at this point.But... DJ Darren Jay saves the day on disc 2. This mix is awesome all the way through. It's clean, it's perfect, has direction and all the tracks are slammin! The [price] would be well justified for Darren's mix alone! This mix is a lot darker than Finn's on disc 1. But hey.. I love both styles. Without the dark, there would be no light!"
3,Eh,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"
2,"Boring, unintelligent story. Cheap animation. Good music.",I purchased this and another Kingdom of Goode title based on the positive reviews from Amazon users. I was extremely disappointed when I received this DVD. The animation is just plain terrible. The story moves along much too slowly to keep a young child's interest. The only positive I found in this video was the quality of the songs. My two-year-old girls very rarely ask to watch this DVD.
5,Keep this book amongst your most precious tools.,"If you are a musician, or even a songwriter, I'd suggest ensuring that a copy of the Indie Bible is always amongst your most precious tools. This is the book that can turn your perilous road with hidden traps and clauses into an easy to follow yellow brick one, leading you straight to your goals. Naturally, you'll still need a couple of things of your own - like talent and drive. If you have those, the rest can't be too far behind with the help you'll find here."
4,Helpful,"This was a good read, full of helpful info and contacts. A bit lengthy but other than that is was cool."
5,Even better than I thought it would be!,"I got the Bible and it was even better than I thought it would be. Great product, I can't wait to start sending stuff out!!"
4,"Good book, but use the Oracle documentation as well..","This book does exactly what it sets out to do - prepare you for the OCP 9i Performance Tuning exam. However, be warned - it is not a comprehensive tuning manual, nor does it have in-depth explanations of tuning concepts. For this reason I would recommend supplementing this guide with the following books from the Oracle Docs: 1) Oracle 9i Database Performance Guide and Reference, 2) Oracle 9i Database Administrator's Guide. I used these two books and Mr. Pack's guide to clear the exam quite handily."
1,NOT VERY GOOD!!!!!,"I have always admired people who spoke with charisma, confidence and seemed as if they have had voice coaching. Thats what I wanted to do too!!!! Sadly though, this book/CD is not for that, the CD bored me completely, I have no problem pronouncing words but I wanted to know how to project it to get power, confidence etc. this book didnt show it- it is for people who have to learn how to use each sound properly.So if your'e looking for a book which shows you how to PROJECT CONFIDENCE, POISE AND POWER ITS NOT FOR YOU!!"
4,Great resource for improving your communication skills,This book provides excellent tips on how to improve your vocal quality in presenting and communicating. Jeffrey does a good job of defining different issues and providing solutions to changing/resolving them. The key is to practice over time. I teach and coach presentation skills and recommend this book to many of my clients.
3,Too little info in the CD,I was a little disappointed that the CD come with the book contains not much - especially the part that suppose to help you to practice your voice.
5,Better Speech,"This is a very good book to help you be a better speaker. I use this book to help train Gospel Preachers to be good speakers in their preaching of God's Word. I highly recommend this book to you, it will help you speak good if you follow the directions and do the assignments in the book.Milton Mathers"
4,"Very good, right up until the part where....","....John Byrne injects *himself* into the actual storyline. The climax has creator Byrne actually drawing himself -- having conversations w/the FF, and even traveling with them to the trial of Reed Richards -- who's on trial for his saving of Galactus back when the FF and Avengers had him at Death's door. This TPB collects this generous act by Richards, as well as the death and rebirth of Terrax the Tamer, his battle against Dr. Doom and the Silver Surfer, and the abduction and trial of Richards, for whom Galactus and Eternity themselves testify."
3,rare chemical brothers track!!!!!!!!!,"If you are a Chemical Brothers fan, this comp contains a track off of their very first and highly sought after ep. Their name back then was the Dust Brothers, but as some know they had to change their name because of the american producers of the same name who did the Fight Club soundtrack. Anyways, My Mercury Mouth, track 2 on here, is one of their first ever tracks and this disc is the only i know of in the world that contains it, since the ""Dust Brothers"" first ep was only produced on vinyl and quickly disappeared. The track is amazing by the way and the rest of the compilation is alright as well."
2,Get it for tracks 8 & 9 only,"Some serious junk on here, but tracks 8 & 9 are classics and if you're putting a mix together are worth getting the CD for. Don't get it if you're on a budget, and need 4/5 tracks to make it worth it."
1,Waste of time,"This movie should have been presented as a 30 minute episode on Goosebumps. There was a constant repitition of needless scenes. All the while I'm thinking, ""Let's get on with the plot already!"" You could see that this technique was a ""time filler"". My granddaughter and I usually enjoy RL Stine-based productions. NOT THIS ONE!"
1,Mostly Ghostly Mostly .....Bad?,"My family and I screened this last last as part of the Wiz-tober Disney Channel presention. The kids were excited as the trailer looked pretty appealing. We popped our popcorn and sat in anticipation and ten minutes into this... we realized this was a stinker.Just about everything is wrong with this film. Cheap production values, really bad script, bad acting, bad casting, cheesy effects... the only bright spot was the over the top acting by the demon (great make-up)We were tricked into this so called treat. But we salvaged the evening with a DVD of Halloween Town.Watch at your own risk. Horrible."
1,MOSTLY GHOSTLY WAS MOSTLY BORING,"Mostly Ghostly was so very boring. Don't Think About (The Haunting Hour) and The Mask (Goosebumps series) were awesome, though."
2,"If by ""no tip"", you mean ""tip""...","I completely agree with the other reviewer in that this toy should not have ""no tip"" on the packaging. Our toddler was unable to balance on it and required us to have to hold his hand(s) to stay on. That said, we did make the best of it, and he had a great time at the pool. It was worth the $5 we paid for it at Target."
2,Not so Totally Awesome,"This game seemed pretty lacking. We've played it once and really pretty much got bored of it already. All the questions seem to revolve around Michael Keaton, Cal Ripken and William Hurt. And there were only four game pieces that were pretty lame (except for the Care Bear).Anyway, if you were a child of the 80's it might be fun for a little bit."
4,TP 80's game,The product was not quite as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered.
1,it was supposed to be a gift.,"i haven't played the game yet, I'm not even sure I'll keep it. i was disappointed that the game did not come wrapped in plastic, (game pieces were) and I'm not happy with the fact that there was a sticker that said ""3.99"" on the package and it won't come off without ripping the box.the packing slip specified that the game is new w/o plastic, but i didn't see that anywhere on the website...I'm not happy, but i may be SOL..."
1,Trivial pursuit,Anothe item I orderd through Amazon and never received. Had to buy it from a local store in time for Christmas. Will never order from Amazon again!
4,Great fun if you remember those years.,"A real ""blast from the past."" If you remember pop culture from those years it can be quite an entertaining game. It will be quite lost on the younger generation. I was young in the 80's and struggled with many questions. My wife was much more aware in those years and mopped the floor with the rest of us."
4,I Love The 80's,"This is a great gqme for those who THINK they know or remember something about the 1980's. It's not as easy as you may think ! Go for it , prove to yourself you haven't forgotten a thing. Told Ya !!!"
2,Teenager in the 80's,"I loved the 80's, but I was not an adult in the 80's. As another had reviewed it,....made for adults in the 80's and not for kids in the 80's. I bought it and my husband and I read the questions. Since we couldn't answer most, we have never pulled it out to play with our friends. Might be better if I give it to my older siblings."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"I love Trivial Pursuit and was very excited to see this '80s version, with its dazzling packaging and all. However, I have been disappointed as it seems this is a half-hearted attempt to market '80s nostalgia. First of all, there is only one box of question cards, and after only two or three games the questions were repeating. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the questions are often either obscure or very easy. You almost get the sense the questions were written by people with no sense of humor. The packaging makes it appear to be a fun, flashy game, but it's kind of a serious game directed at those middle-aged and older."
4,Very cool!!,"If you are into 80s games this one is great. The questions are reasonable but not too easy. The game peices are terrific...a trapper keeper, TRS-80, Care Bear, and a CD. We've played it a lot already and have only had it a short time. The only problem is that there is only one box of cards. Teams have to share the box and we're already repeating questions. I am not sure if there are replacement cards or not but it would be nice if there were more there at purchase."
1,It sounded like a good idea,"Bought this for my husband, who loved living in the 80s. The game pieces are cute at first but difficut to move on the board without the pie-pieces falling off (They slide in from the side instead of drop in from the top). The questions are frustratingly uninteresting - with so many interesting topic possibilities, who cares who the second replacement back-up drummer was to Milli Vanilli?Nice idea, played it once, and it has been gathering dust under our coffee table ever since."
1,Not what you would expect.....,"I am very disappointed by the people who made this game. I thought Trivial Pursuit was better than this. I love the 80s, but I didn't like this game. First of all, it's cheaply made. The cards dont even fit in thier holders. The peices are also cheap, as well as the board, and there arent 6 peices like all thier other games. I will never buy another Trivial Pursuit game with out seeing it first. Very disappointed, thought they were better than that."
3,Just FAIR.... describes this game.,If you grew up in the 80's chances are you'll know some of the questions. Some we found rather hard though. It got boring quickly. The game pieces were neat and the price was way better than any department store. Might be more fun after a few beers!
1,Guess we are not children of the 80's,We were very excited to play this game. On Christmas night a group of five family members...all with college degrees and advanced degrees...tried our hand at this game. Three of us were actually people who grew up in the 80s. I think out of about 50 questions we could answer...maybe 3.......We got frustrated...put it away...opened some brewskis...and watched CARS with the little guys.
4,Good game if you like trivial pursuit,"Overall I like this game although the questions are harder than I expected having grown up in the 80's - especially related to headlines. The character pieces are clever (Trapper Keeper, an old Apple computer,etc.). What kept me from giving the game a 5 is that they only give you one box of cards rather than the two boxes I got last time I bought trivial pursuit (it's been awhile - maybe that's how they do it now). Also, the cards go in the card holder in two stacks that are side by side rather than one long stack. I'm not sure what the point of this is other than to give the illusion that you have more cards than you do but it really makes no sense. The two stacks always want to fall into each other since there is no divider and it's just messy.Overall a good game. I'm glad I bought it."
3,long game ..very hard questions,"I agree with the other reviews..This game is alot harder than I expected..And the 3rd time we played it, we already had gone through all of the cards and were getting repeat questions from the 1st and 2nd time we played..it is a very long game."
3,An OK physics text,"This book was certainly adequate for intro physics in college. Like most physics books, it attempts to make physics engaging through interesting illustrations and ""applications"" problems. I am giving this book three stars because math and physics are not generally interesting when applied to trivial, imaginary problems about frictionless pullies and counting out change: they are better illustrated through the beauty of the theory upon which they are constructed. But I guess the ""applications"" paradigm is not the fault of the author."
3,Not the best,"I am currently using this book for my last quarter of Physics. The subject matter itself can be difficult and confusing but this book makes things even more confusing and difficult at times. Sometimes it's frustrating because even though this book is a requirement for my classes, the professors explain things differently(and better) than how they are explained in the book because they do not agree with the book's method and do not like the book very much. I have to agree with them. This book does a lousy job at explaining the concepts of Physics to the average college student, with no prior experience in the subject matter."
1,horrible book,"This book just throws formulas and examples at you without explaining the ""Principles of the physics"" I was forced to purchase this book for a class but I learn most of the material from other peoples notes on the internet.Unless you have to I would not purchase this book."
1,what?,package never opened or checked from what I could tell b y your plant--thus I receive it with a nice 4-5 inch crack on themarcle. And awaiting info on returning it can't get a reply. Please help! What do I have to do to return it ?Wanted to call can not find a phone number?
2,cheesy but cute,"Not Bombay-type quality, but it'll do. To be honest, unless this is available with free shipping, it's really not worth the effort. To hide in a corner, it's sufficient but rickety."
2,poor quality,"Completely disappointed with this product. Returned the first one, because (I thought) it was damaged. When the replacement came in, it was just as bad. Apparently what I thought was damage, was just the poor quality of this product. Would not recommend anyone to purchase this."
2,not too pleased,"This product of Clorox Toilet Wand was not at all what I was expecting, they were considerably smaller, thinner and just generally punier than the original size. Not at all like the nice full, plump, round scrubber on the picture. I suppose that in all fairness it gets the job done, but it takes a fair bit more scrubbing and ""elbow grease"" than with my older ""original"" wand refills. :( boooooh!!!!!!"
3,"Smaller pads, same cleaning solution","I read the other reviews regarding the smaller scrubbing brushes on these and thought it would be OK. But, I can totally tell a difference. Versus the picture on the box, they are much thinner. While I think there is just as much cleaning solution, they don't seem to hold up as much as putting pressure on to scrub makes them even thinner. I don't know why Clorox changed the pads, maybe because these are one time use and the thinner pads make less of an impact on the environment? Who knows! But they should change the picture on the box to reflect the pads inside the box! Next time I will find at retail and check the inside of the box before I purchase."
5,handy cleaner,"I can no longer find these in our local stores, so I was happy to find them online. They work well and are an easy and convenient cleaner."
5,down comforter,This was a gift and my daughter and son in law love it. It is nice and warm worth the money.
4,We like it!,"This was an exceptional value. It is warm, fluffy... and overall we are very pleased with the quality. We got a king size for our queen bed and it fits beautifully (we like lots of overhang). I would recommend to a friend."
1,Buy Standard Deviants,Search in the standard deviants with the same title - Instead of teaching systems plug in Standard deviants.The Standard Deviants price are cheaper
1,Speed issue...maybe my fault but worth reading,"I was using a D-Link DIR-655 router with a 6' CAT 5 cable. My connection speed is around 40mbs download, 4mbs upload (Roadrunner Lightning service).I wanted to move my router a few feet so I ordered this 10' cable. It's amazingly inexpensive and Linksys and Cisco are great names.Problem? This cable cuts my speed in HALF for downloads (20mbs) and totally ruins upload speed (0.4mps...less than 10% the speed with the other cable).It's not because it's 4' longer because I have a 50' CAT 5 delivering full speed to other parts of the house.This new cable is thinner than the 6' I tried to replace. Maybe that one is shielded and that's what's causing the problem? Maybe I just got a bad cable? If anyone has advice I'd like to hear it. It's not worth returning for a $2 refund, but this cable is unusable for me."
5,Cat 5 Network cable,"We ordered several of these and not much to say about a cable other than it does the job and we have had no issues with it. Everything works and connected great. Quality made, not cheap and flimsy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't bother,Toledo is simply a pale imitation/caricature of Tom Waits. Do yourself a favor and buy one of his albums instead.
4,The Toledo Show,"These Guys Play every Sunday night in Santa Monica at Harvel's,, AMAZING SHOW!! Probably my favorite in LA!!"
4,Repetitious,"Once again, it contains material available on videos I have previously purchased. If you have no other such videos you will undoubtedly like this one. I keep hoping the History Channel will do another one as they seem to use material that is not seen on every train video available. I guess the need to view steam trains is a sign of old age and incipient nostalgia syndrome."
3,Crystal clear sound of a boring recording,"These two orchestral showpieces should be nothing short of thrilling. Lorin Maazel's wonderful technique and penchant for orchestral refinement takes these musical gems and removes all the luster and glow. These are highly polished, crystal clear recordings that are played wonderfully. Yet, the puckish charm of Till Eulenspiegel is missing and the over-indulgent glory of Heldenleben is gone. Buy this CD only if you are interested in Maazel's interpretations, which, in my opinion, are slow, dynamically uninteresting, and odd in their lack of charm."
2,I've read it all and I'm still asking why,"It is clear from reading this book that no one is able to fully understand or explain Mary Kay Letourneau and her obsessive relationship with her student, a 13 year-old boy less than half her age. Although Olsen presents a lot of information, there is no summation and it leaves the reader back at the beginning wondering why it all happened."
2,It needs more details,"This book was ok, but it needed alot more details. It takes you from Mary Kay hanging out with the kids after school to her being pregnant with nothing in between. The story needed to tell of how this came about: how did she just decide she was in love with him, how did they come to have sex, where did they first have sex, what was Vili's thought on the situation, how did he react when she told him she was pregnant? You get my point, maybe these details weren't needed but it certainly would have made the book more interesting."
3,A story that will leave you with many mixed emotions!,"As a women,I see a side to this story that is very romantic, I don't feel that what she did was right,however lets not portray her as a sick women,I believe she was lonely, a very unhappy women,who looked for love in all the wrong places.Unfortunately we must pay for our wrong choices in life.But what about Vili? yes he was 13, ,but what kind of counseling has he recived? Is he protrayed as a sick person? although he was young,I think he knew all along what was happening,and loved every minute of it, I can only hope that when he becomes of legal age these two souls come together again,and get the chance to prove that love has no age. So before you cast the first stone,remember this could have been you.The song goes (if loveing you is wrong,I don't want to be right) how many times have you felt that?"
1,the spirit of love,"this story maybe represent the life which we would like to have it, to have the real feelings which we need it, even we may faces many problems, but who love, he must do the impossible to give his life the satisfying he see it...."
1,What a nut!,"Regardless of Mary Kay's childhood, her distant husband or anything else that is thrown at us as an excuse, Mary Kay is nuts and if she was a man, there wouldn't be one excuse made for him. The real victims are the children of Mary Kay. I can only hope they receive good care and are kept away from this looney tune. I don't know about you, but if I had a friend or neighbor that hung around with a pre-teen day and night, I would drop a dime."
3,If Loving You is Wrong,"It was okay - I think I'm going back to reading these kinds of books as print books, I rather like the pictures."
1,Boring,If you're familiar with the story already don't bother reading this book. It would be a waste of your time.
3,Just O.K.,I did learn some things about the case. But I found that Mr Olsen repeated chapter after chapter that they were in love. It was almost like he felt like he needed to convence us.
3,The price was right and curiosity prompted my purchase,I would not recommend this book to anyone other than to satisfy a behind the scenes mentality. It read fast but that was the best thing about it.
3,Needs Editor's Red Pencil,Needs far more editing. Many incorrect spellings and the last portion of the book repeats itself ad nauseum. The story is interesting but wading through the book really wasn't worth the effort.
5,If Loving You Is Wrong Mary Kay Letourneau,"This gripping book by Gregg Olsen provides the most accurate and behind the scenes information on the tragic case of former 6th grade teacher, Mary Kay Letourneau, and her affair with her student, 13 year old Vili Fualaau. Their relationship produced 2 children. Mr Olsen brings us into the the lives of the people who make up this remarkable story. Jammed packed with solid information on how this affected their families, the community, and those around them. Additionally, the book delves into those who exploited Mary Kay and this story for personal and financial gain. An excellent book. I found this an unable to put down read....thank you Gregg!"
3,Also read Mass With Mary by Christina Dress,"If you liked this book, you'll also like ""Mass With Mary-The Prison Years"" by Christina Dress. Her book picks up where Mr. Olsen's book ends - Mary Letourneau in prison and what happened over the next several years. Her book will make you laugh, cry, and at times, both."
5,TRAGIC,I could not put this book down! It was very well researched and provided a lot of information and insight into why Mary fell in love with a 13 year old. She is a tragic figure. I am left wondering what will become of her and Villi when her 7 years in prison are up. I hope her life - and his - take a turn for the better!
5,A great curl-yourself-up read!,"Again, Greg Olsen has done it. As a true crime fan (I have read them all), he is simply the best. All the questions were answered regarding this strange criminal. The press portrayed her as a lovely teacher/mom who made one tragic error. Instead he creates fabulous portrait of a selfish, materialistic dim bulb. After you read this, it all makes so much sense -- Book is way too delicious to resist."
5,Eye-opening account of a true crime,I thought I knew what this story was about -- and boy was I wrong. This is one of those haunting true crime stories that stays with you as you wonder what will become of the people the author has written about. Highly recommended.
3,"Good coverage of the facts, but you have to dig for them!","I am surprised by the reviews that mention this as a well-written book. It contains sufficient editorial errors (names spelled differently throughout the text, for example) to lose credibility in my eyes. It is also extremely verbose in ways that do not add to the imagery or story in any way. Makes me wonder if the author got paid by the word. That said, the book contains a great deal of information about the Mary Kay phenomenon and I feel as though I got what I wanted to get out of reading this book."
4,"Intriguing, Thought-Provoking Book","This was a book that was very hard to put down. I learned a lot about the Mary Kay/Vili story that I had not known before (after all, how can you rely on the tabloids and/or tabloid television) for accurate information?Mr. Olsen has done a great job of comprehensively researching the key players in this ""predator/victim story"" or ""love story,"" depending on how you view the relationship between Mary and Vili. I was appalled at the level of greed and exploitation in this story (ESPECIALLY among Mary's attorneys, friends close to Mary, members of Vili's family).It is obvious that Mary has problems, but is she a child molestor and did she deserve to be sentenced to prison for 7 1/2 years? I don't know the answer to the former, but to the latter, I emphatically say, ""No!"" I feel that if Mary had been a male and Vili a female, the punishment would have been MUCH less severe."
2,YUCK.,"I was drawn to this book like everyone else, through the awful newspaper stories following this woman. The author never interviews the boy, but does interview Mary from prison. Possibly because of this, the book thankfully does not give details of their sexual relationship, but also never gives insight into what most people want to know--why would she do this? I have always been a true crime fan, but because of the subject matter, I felt awful reading this. Obviously not a book I should have chosen in the first place."
3,Mary is a pedophile,"I am amazed at times at the ability of writers to be neutrally compasionate about their subjects, as is Mr. Olsen. However, as the mother of a fourteen year old boy, I know Mary is a pedophile. I wonder if Mary will now find another young boy to focus on since Vili is older.Almost as offensive as the crimes she committed is the fact that there is some sympathy for her situation. Why? Because she is a female pedophile? She is no different from any male teacher that sexually abuses a young female student. As a society we should be offended at this double standard.I do not understand how or why anyone has sympathy for this pedophile rapist."
2,"Subpar, in all aspects","I don't know which was worse: the behavior of the people depicted in this book, or the writing and lack of editing.I have come to expect to find a few errors in Kindle editions, but the amount in this book was simply staggering. There were errors on every page; errors in grammar, spelling, syntax, italiics, punctuation. The sheer volume of them greatly interfered with the text's meaning. The writing is garbled and confusing.If the author and publisher can't be bothered to proofread the text (and charge seven dollars for it) then why should anyone bother to read it?"
4,"Not bad, but slow-moving!","This book is well-researched, but the author is no Ann Rule! The pace is slow - non-fiction can be done with style and there isn't much here. I found myself skimming large portions."
4,Tastes good,This tastes great although I do add a little more cinnamon. It does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product.
2,just alright,"This product was ok, but due to it's size (each feeds two) it does not really work for me. It tastes fine and I will use up what I have for on the go times."
3,"Good flavor, but too many servings.","This stuff tastes great, maybe because it has too much sugar! Plus each cup has two servings. Smaller cups and not so much sweetnessis needed. Kids liked it at first, but they each wanted their own cup. I wasted 1 cups worth of oatmeal each day since they did not eat all of their own cups. Won't buy again simply because of the waste."
4,Fascinating Presentation,"A look at the life of early american pioneers through the eyes of emigrants from another country. After reading so many books on American Pioneers, I found it interesting to read about the reasons someone from another country would want to come to this one and eak out an existence on the bleak ,completely different new frontier."
1,Critical Errors- DO NOT BUY,"This book is rife with errors and mistakes, an in critical ways. For example, one question, on a fairly basic topic, asked what %age guanines are in a DNA molecule (double-stranded) that contains 20% thymines and 30% purines. Given that guanine is a purine, and adenine is a purine, this implies that the breakdown is as follows: 20% A, 20% T, 10% G, 40% C. This is clearly impossible, as that would not be a stable molecule.Other idiotic errors abound, but I provide that as the absolutely worst examples. This book leaves me with absolutely no idea how well I will do on the GRE, and has basically been a useless study aid. I find myself correcting it far more often than it corrects me."
2,NOT very professional,"I found many typos in this book - the carbon atom has 5 covalent bonds sticking out in the diagram, the math derivation seems not coherent, etc.I am a little disappointed since the book was written by two PhDs."
2,Emphasized the wrong material!,"I bought this book because it was the only test prep book available at the time for the GRE Biochemistry subject test. The book put a lot of emphasis biochemical synthesis and degradation pathways for amino acids, lipids, nucleotides etc. and I was up until 2:00 am the night of my exam trying to memorize all of this material which I had never learned. When I got into the test the next morning, I realized that all of my memorization had been completely pointless.The real GRE is nothing like the practice exams in this book! Also, there are many errors in the questions and in the answer keys.If you want to buy this book as a general review, it has good information for the Cell and Molecular Biology sections, but the Biochem section goes into way too much detail and the practice exams are pretty terrible."
2,An less than adequate test prep,"This book provides a very, very basic review of the major concepts of biochem, cell biology, and molecular biology (i.e. genetics). I found this review helpful, but the detailed questions of the actual exam require a much more detailed review. This prep was also chaulk-full of typos, mistakes, improperly tagged vocab words, and incorrectly drawn chemical structures (texas carbons and nitrogens, double bonds to hydrogen atoms, etc.) that required me to look up the actual structure or correct definition. The practice exams were also a bit easier than the actual exam was, so an accurate gauge of how well you are doing cannot be obtained with this test prep. If all you need is a brief review before your subject exam, then this will probably work, otherwise review your old corsework and notes."
3,"Decent, but harder than the real thing","I used this as a review guide for the Biochem GRE. I'd only taken a one-summer biochem class, so I was feeling weak in that area, although confident about the rest. The book has good organization, and doesn't go too in-depth into one topic at the expense of others.The biggest problem I had with it was that it was much harder than the real test! I was very worried that I was going to do terribly, and this made me more anxious than I should have been. In the last few days before I took the one real exam that I had, and it was much easier than the book's questions. There were much more biochem pathway trivia in the book than on the real exam.There are some factual errors in this book, and hopefully future editions will get a little more proofreading."
4,good,"I received the product very quickly. It was tough to find a GRE book for the biochemistry subject test because there are few out there. Since there are no biochem test prep books to compare this to, I'd have to give this one a thumbs up for its straight to the point style."
3,"Not the Best Kipper Video, But Still Worth Buying","We own Pools Parks & Picnics, Fun In the Sun, Let It Snow, and the Playtime DVDs. I would have to say this ranks at the bottom of the popularity list among all that we own, but it's still good ole Kipper, so if you already have a few, it might be worth adding to your collection. If you haven't yet purchased Playtime, I would recommend that one for sure, followed by Pools Parks & Picnics -- buy those before you buy this one."
3,Cute!,This is a good show for kids from about age two up to six. I got the dvd on time & there was nothing wrong with it.
4,"Lots of air, decent filtering, cleanable.","Certainly the lowest cost cleanable air filter I have seen for my 2001 Grand AM V6 3400 engine. It might just be the unit I got, but the black rubber surround was slightly thicker than the regular Fram air filter that uses a softer orange foam surround. And so it was harder to push this properly into place. But it does fit. Cleaning is easy. Air flow is very high. Though you can see the air holds as the fiber portion is low. So filtering properties are low. Dust will certainly make it inside the engine, but it keeps out larger particles that would be the real issue. Great air flow and long lasting with the ability to easily clean it. That with the low cost compared to K&N and other high airflow filters, makes this a good buy. I gave it 4/5 stars for the tighter than usual fit and for lower filtering properties than non-cleanable filters. But still an excellent filter."
5,Incredibly beautiful proofs for God as Creator of all.,"Whether you believe in God or not, this documentary will change your life with the beauty it holds. It is packed full of history, facts, and amazing views of creation, all presented with an excitement that draws you in and makes you feel like you're there on the islands too. Even the music is amazing. A must see for anyone who cares in the least about where he or she came from."
5,One of the best unknown CD's I've ever heard,This CD is awesome. It has to be because this is the 3rd time I'm buying because somehow or another people end up taking it because they like it so much. Though it is not exactly what you would consider a continuous mix it still a bangin' CD that will keep you moving throughout the whole thing. It's too bad they didn't come out with a sequel.
1,Extreme Safety Hazard could cause injury or death,"Purchased this product. The saw works great, This product has a weak link and could cause injury or death. While using the pole chainsaw the coupling nut on the pole cracked. The now running chain saw pole collapsed and twisted downward toward my body. I released the switch and was spared injury or death. Should you purchase this product be aware of the coupling nut on the pole and be aware it could crack and cause injury. I have contacted the manufacturer and sent photos of the defective coupling. To try and get service on this product also is a hassle. I was sent to a repair dealer Arizona Air Cooled Engines who stated he has not repaired Mcculloch product for several years because of poor working relationships. I have notified Mcculoch of this safty problem and have received no reply. Should you buy this product use EXTREME CAUTION!!!!!!!!!!"
4,McCulloch MS1015P 10-Inch 10 amp 1.5 HP Electric Pole Saw,"Extension pole is round, so when you extend and tighten it the switch rotates to wrong position unless you concentrate on aligning it with the blade. This does allow for lefties to operate it though. The saw is heavy after cutting for a while and the motor interferes with seeing your cut. So far I find no manufacturers wise enough to put the motor at the bottom of the pole."
3,did the job,"bought this little sucker at Costco. did the job of taking down a tree that was buckling my concrete walkway. loaned it to my nephew to trim a tree. came back with it chain off. reattached it came back again. found the chain bar was held by 2 bolts he had lost one of the bolts. no wonder the bar kept slipping. replace the othe bolt and tried to tighten the nuts, bolt head kept slipping in the plastic recess. milled off the plastic to get wrench on both the bolt head and nut. got it back weeks later tried to trim a tree with it, a dull butter knife would have been faster. he swore chain never touch dirt. now looking for a replacement 10 inch chain so far no luck at Lowe's, Home Depot, not even Mclendon."
2,DOESN'T OPEN WIDE,"It's a good concept, and it's good quality. But it doesn't open wide, making it a little frustrating to use. You should know it only opens to 3.25"" max."
3,Hard to use.,I found these tongs difficult to use because of spring tension and they don't grip well.
1,Old version of the project,"This book is way out of date, the current status of this free project can be found at linuxfromscratch.org. The publishers of this book took material from the site and published it in paper form. The LFS version in this book is 2.2, currently it is 2.4.Plus there are some questions about the publishers not talking to the actual author before publishing."
1,Another Game With No System Requirements Listed,"This is the second game I have had to look up on the Internet to find out the system requirements because they are not listed on Amazon. The same company, Valusoft, is the 2 games I have found so far that does not list their system requirements on Amazon. Here are the System Requirements according to Valusoft's web site:5200 Great GamesSystem RequirementsOperating System: Windows ME/XPDirectX: 9.0cProcessor: Pentium III 700 MHz or BetterRAM: 128 MBHard Drive Space: 4 GB hard disk space (to install all games)Drives: DVD-ROM driveVideo Card: 64 MB DirectX 9 compatible video cardSound Card: Direct X compatible sound cardI do not own this game and I have not played this game because I have Windows Vista which is not listed on the requirements. So I can only give this game a one star since the requirements were not listed. It probably is a pretty good game as the previous viewer stated, but I will never know from personal experience."
4,The secret revealed!,"Hibiki gets a REAL taste of war when he ends up on a ship operated by both men and women together, and they are attacked for the ""Harvest."" The reason for the separation of male and female becomes clear as the main battleships come to collect the ""Harvest"" from the Nirvana's crew's home planets.The Nirvana is in deep DEEP trouble when they have to destroy a battleship, but it takes all their wits AND resources to destroy just one. How are they going to handle five?This becomes more interesting as it goes along, and manages to keep it funny at the same time. The interaction between men and women is just hilarious and all the foibles of communication we have is pushed to the extreme. Men are from Mars, Women from Venus indeed!"
4,Take it slow,"I like the size and weight of the tool. Jordan is a big dog that would not let me touch his feet for two years after I got him from the Humane Soceity. I started out just turning it on and playing with my own nails. It has been about three weeks now and I can touch it to two or three of his nails for about a second or two. I expect this is going to gradually increase. I want to make it work, as the alternative of nail clippers is not acceptable to us. The tool would have to be completely silent for me to rate it a 5"
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"Takes way too long to file nails. Dogs seem still stressed, and you can get a back ache after doing just a couple of nails. At least if you clip the nails it is done in a couple of minutes. I think this is less stress on your dog right there. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this."
1,Dremmel pet groomer #761 cordless,"I was really disappointed with this product.It simply can not hold a charge .I go thru the 4AAA batteries like they were water, and I even changed battery brands with no success.Four paws will cost you 16 batteries.If you want to use it for a quick touch up, AFTER using another dremmel it would be ok..just don't use it as the main product.I like the dremmel brand and have two other dremels including a chargable cordless that work fine..I give this a 1 out of 10"
1,Eats Batteries,"The batteries die while being stored within the device, to lengthen battery life. Remove when not being used!!"
1,Not enough power,"With fresh batteries, this tool is still very slow. Not nearly fast enough to do the job quickly (which is essential with an animal that doesn't like to be held)."
1,a waste,I used it one time and it broke ---before it broke it didn't work well---you would be better off just tossing your money out the window rather then buy this piece of junk---a negative 5 stars
2,Not so great on big dogs,"My medium-sized dog was scared by the noise so I don't know how well it would have worked on him; for my larger dog's nails, it did not seem powerful enough to grind them down effectively. Even with the coarsest grinding wheel, it took a long time to do each nail and even then I was worried about the amount of ""heat"" building up from the friction. I regularly get her nails ground at the vet and no issues there, so perhaps the portable home-use variety is just an option for the small dogs with thinner nails."
2,Not bad but not good.,"I have this for my 2 dogs nails and I have to say the batteries don't last very long. It is also not too powerful. When grinding a dogs nail you are not supposed to put pressure on the nail but the grinder should spin fast enough to remove the nail on its own. My dremel doesn't have the speed to do that unless i use new batteries each time. Of course, buying batteries left and right, I could have purchased the rechargable, more powerful minimite and at this point I would have spent less money going that route, I would also have a much better grinder."
2,"Cat owner in San Jose, CA",I bought this item since I thought it would be a quick and painless way to cut my two indoor cat's nails. OMG...My first cat is a little skittish anyways and absolutely freaked out when I turned the Dremel on. It makes a lot of noise and my cat when nuts. My second cat is so laid back and not usually afraid of anything. I got one nail done before he went nuts. I couldn't get near them with this thing. It's too loud and not as easy to use as I thought. I'm going back to the clippers. They're quicker and less traumatic. Too bad I missed returning them back in time. Now I'm stuck with them. Maybe in a couple years I'll get a dog and be able to use them on it if I need to. What a waste of money.
2,Worked well initially but fizzled out after a few months.,"I have a small terrier and really liked how quiet this nail groomer was. She did not seem so tramatized by it.It did quite a nice job when it worked, but unfortunately, it did not last long enough to really make it worth it. Now when I put it up to her nails, it fizzles out immediately. I even ordered 3 more boxes of the discs, and now have no use for them."
5,My Boston Terrier loves her new Dremel!,"My Boston Terrier, Maggie, used to run away from me when I got the nail clippers out. She would pull away and sometimes cause me to cut closer to the quick than I should. Now she lays in my arms while I file her nails. It doesn't hurt her and I don't have to worry about cutting them too close, or splitting them."
3,Good but not great,"Well, my dog hates it. I've used it a bunch of times and she still gives me a murderous look everytime I pull it out, then she runs to her bed. It takes about 30-60 seconds for me to file EACH nail (her nails grow long, thick, and fast), which means it takes just under 5 minutes for each paw, with lots of wriggling and wrestling. I wish I'd gotten the larger size because the heads they gave me seem too small/not rough enough for my dog's nails. She is only 40 pounds.I guess it's less harmful than regular clippers, but it is still not a pleasant experience. Overall, I'd recommend it because it's easy to assemble and uses batteries, but just know that it's not a miracle solution to doggy pedicures."
1,Don't waste your money,This Dremel does not have enough power to trim either of my 45 or 85 pound dogs' nails. It also will suck the battery life and overheat. I can only trim 2 paws and then will have to wait to cool the motor and change the batteries. Very disappointing.
5,Works Great.,Had the Peticure and didn't care for it. Cost $20 for shipment to and for return. Should have spent the $20 on this item to begin with. Product works wonderful and rechargeable batteries are a must.
3,"Works fine, but...","...our dog absolutely hates both the noise and the feeling that this makes against his claws. He is a lab/border collie mix. We got this because he always makes such a ruckus at the vet getting his nails clipped. I was afraid to trim his nails, and thought this would be a good compromise.Since our dog hated this so much we couldn't keep him still, we ordered the bamboo nail clippers instead and he likes those a lot better.If your dog is sensitive to noise, I would avoid this product."
3,Dremmel Pet Groomer,"First of all, using the Dremmel Pet Grooming tool is a lot less stress on me. I always have the fear of clipping into the quick while using clippers. Overall the tool is fast and painless. The only obstical to overcome is getting my dog to sit still when the motor starts."
2,May work on a dog that is under anasthetic...,"We have a pretty mellow lab and even with giving her bones and treats, after she was good and tired, there was no way we were going to get her to allow us to use this product. It is simply too loud and traumatizing. For others interested in this product I really hope you have incredible patience and a lot of money to spend on batteries because that is what it will take to get your dog adjusted to the Dremel."
1,EATS BATTERIES -- Buy one with a cord!,"Although this does a WONDERFUL job trimming my two dogs' nails (JRTs), I would not buy it unless you own stock in a battery company. I literally have to buy new batteries every time I do their nails. Also, because the batteries have to be changed so often, the pieces of the tool are starting to wear from being taken apart/put together. I am going to buy one that plugs in!!!"
4,Nice tool -- here's a tip!,"I just ordered this tool last week and followed the tips of others (getting my dog used to the noise, giving her treats, only working for very short periods). Of course, the treats were ""scarfed down"" very quickly and then she wanted to quit.The solution!! I lined a bowl with peanut butter! Not much, just enough to keep her busy for awhile. It allowed me to work longer & she didn't even care that I was playing with her feet. When the bowl was cleaned, we were both ready to quit. I'll do this every few days until her nails are perfectly trimmed.Hope this works for you, too."
1,Pet nail groomer,"I had a minimite for the past 5 years and it was good, but the battery started to fail and wasn't holding a charge long enough to complete my dog's nails so I need a new one. The pet groomer is a battery HOG. Unsatisfactory run time. Going to find another minimite or other 7.2 V cordless dremmel."
3,"My dog votes ""no""","This item ""works"" but my dog does not like it - after a month of trying to get him used to it, he still won't let me file his nails with it. I will keep trying but I'm not optimistic."
1,Not enough power,"I was disappointed with this dremel. It may work for very, very small dogs or cats but nothing much bigger. It takes forever just to do one nail on my 15Lb. dog and I didn't even attempt to try it on my 70Lb. dog. And the batteries run low very quickly."
2,Good product but it sucks up batteries,"This is my first time using a dremel for my dog's nails. She has always been so squemish when it comes to nail trimming and I figured a dremel would be easier on the both of us.The dremel works very well but it drains alot of batteries. I put in 4 Kirkland signature batteries and it completely drained them within about 30 minutes. I then tried energizer batteries and they lasted a little bit longer but not very much longer.If you want to use this product as a portable device I suggest you use rechargeable batteries, otherwise go for the one with the plug."
2,High speed doesn't work. Low speed best for small dogs.,"When the Dremel arrived, I realized that the high speed doesn't work. Nothing happens. At all. Most annoying.Since my dogs' nails were really long, I used the low speed. This takes forever but works well. The dogs don't like it but I'm sure they'll get use to it. I used a similar product on dog nails when I worked at a vet clinic. Here's a tip: If you dog doesn't get use the Dremel and constantly protests when it's pulled out, try giving them peanut butter. Dogs love it, it's inexpensive, and it's super gooey which keeps them busy while you work on their nails.I'd give this a higher rating if the high speed worked and it had a bit more power. GREAT if you have smaller/medium size dogs (vs my collie and chow)."
4,Great for Dogs mostly....,"It is very good for dogs. Esp. those with dark colored nails so that you can't see the quick. Be careful not to tangle up in the dog's coat. My Sheltie and Port.Water Dog have long coats and I inadvertantly pulled away from the nail and tangled up in their legs.If you are not good with clipping cat nails, I suppose it is good as well. I prefer the clippers for them.My bird freaked when she felt the fibration on her nails. May not be good for them. Esp. small birds. Large birds, if you have the know how and time to teach them to tolerate it, would be great as well."
3,Kind of disappointing,"I am always afraid to clip my dog's nails in fear I will cut too short. I thought this would be a nice replacement for the clippers. My dog's nails were really long and I ended up just going back to the clipper because this took forever. I suppose on a smaller dog this would be fine, but my 55 lb German Shepherd has big feet, long, thick nails. Grinding down even one nail 1/8 inch takes forever, which my dog is completely unwilling to sit by and let me do to him. I hoped it would be super fast and powerful. It's just kind of disappointing. I use it now to smooth out the edges after I use the real clippers, which seems to be an OK role for this dremel."
1,DO NOT BUY,I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS. I HAVE A MINITURE DOXIE AND IT WON'T EVEN WORK ON HIS CLAWS. I EVEN INVESTED IN A 1/4 INCH DRUM MAKING THE SANDER BIGGER AND IT STILL DIES AFTER ABOUT 1 PAW.
5,"Like all Dremel products, it's quality designed and built.","It may not be useful for trim a pet's nails, it's still useful for a myriad of applications. I finally have a pet who will tolerate it's use. The intent was clever, but most animals would find it intolerable. The Dremel design makes it still useful for numerous applications."
3,its ok,"it did the job for years. i think there are better tools out there now. it just recently lost the high speed, but works on low speed. i havent decided whether or not to get another (different) tool, or to just use this one on low speed."
1,Disappointed,"In theory, I thought this product would be great. Unfortunately, I tried three separate sets of batteries, but to no avail."
1,Cheap build,I used the tool 2 or 3 times and noticed that the high speed didnt work. After trying 2 different sets of new batteries I realized that the tool was defective. It was past the 30 day return window so I'm stuck with it. Cheap tool.
2,Not Powerful Enough,"I ordered this ""pet nail trimmer"" because I didn't want to spend the additional $25 for the more powerful Dremel. I just needed it for my small dog's nails. It's battery powered. Even with my very first use and brand new batteries -- it bogs down and does not get the nail ground off. I'm disappointed because now I've wasted the cost for this, and still need a nail trimmer! I would not recommend this unit. Go ahead and get the more powerful Dremel that's rechargeable and multi-purpose."
