5,Insightful and therapeutic,"I have read many of her books and have enjoyed all of them, this was no different. It was difficult to get through the begining of the book, but it is neccesary for people to understand that though the book is fiction the abuse is all to real and all to common. People who disliked the book because of the difficult begining, I believe did so, because of their inability to face what truely happens to so many children. The fact that she was able to live in the convent and find God is the most fictional aspect of the book. All to often children of abuse continue a life of heartache and hardship. They never learn to love or let themselves be loved. But D.S. allows the reader to have hope for the victims. I believe that this book is theraputic for survivors of child abuse."
3,heavy on the pathos,How many terrible things can happen to one person? The plot had too many downers and not enough uppers. Falling in love with your doctor? The ending was too predictable by far.
5,Horse Care Info,This book is a must have for horse/pony owners and or potential owners. Lots of good info in a relatively small book. Check it out!
5,A True Music Fan,"This slight confection is a very listenable, modern,hip-hop tune from the Original Supreme. Her scratchy alto is more comfortable with ballads or rock/soul but she does a good job on a slight tune here. In the past this one-time Supreme only sang &quot;ooh Baby&quot; but now listen to her and you will be the one saying &quot;Ooh Baby!&quot;. All of the former Supremes are extremely talented. Here is one more proof that she has in an overlooked gem and the best kept secret in the music biz."
2,"Disappointing, but some articles of value","This book will be a real disappointment to readers who expect a collect of articles on the restoration or reproduction of houses in the Craftsman style. Most of the builders/architects whose work is included seem to think that ""Craftsman style"" means ""use a lot of visible wood in the interior."" Additionally, there is one real horror of a remuddling of a hapless bungalow.However, there are a handful of articles of real value, mostly on restorations. These are almost worth the relatively inexpensive price of the book."
1,Craftsman-Style Houses by Fine Homebuilding,"At best, this book is mis-titled. With a few exceptions, it takes a smattering of abstract interpretations and applications of the Craftsman Style and incorporates them into new homes. Maybe it was my fault for literally interpreting the title, but this is not a reference for Craftsman/Arts & Crafts/Bungalow style architectural elements nor design. I am a Taunton Publishing fan, but this was a real disappointment and a waste of my money."
3,"Cute, but not what I was going for","I bought these because my daughter has just learned her letters and their sounds, and is starting to put simple words together. The phrases on the cards use letter sounds and combinations that aren't on a beginner level in my opinion, i.e. ""th"", ""gh"" as in night, ""ea"" and other things that aren't the obvious sounds a beginner reader would expect. So, if you're looking for something to encourage a young reader, get something else.They are, however, beautiful, sturdy and simple in design."
3,An interesting view of our future from our past,"In this follow-up to ""Destination Moon"" producer George Pal wanted to show how, possibly, our life in space would look. He used the book THE CONQUEST OF SPACE by Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell as his basis and created a story of the first manned expedition to Mars. While the technology is deeply rooted in the 1950's, it interesting to note that the rotating space station that figures so prominently in the first half of the film is built as a combined project of the US, UK, Germany, Japan, Russia, etc., the same as the soon-to-be-launched ISS. While the film is not nearly as good as some of Pal's other works, such as ""War of the Worlds"" or ""When Worlds Collide,"" it's still definitely worth a look.Sadly, the producers of the video decided to release the tape in the EP/SLP format, resulting in a picture that is OK, but very grainy and sometimes hard to keep on track. It does have Hi-Fi sound, which is nice and clear. END"
3,One Evocative Scene at Least,"There is one very evocative scene showing the ship drifting through space on its way to Mars. I always think of this scene when I contemplate the real Mars trip which hopefully humans will one day take. But the characters don't seem particularly interesting, and the religous fanatic angle comes out of left field. Also, in a movie intended to be a serious look at space travel, it strains credibility that one could change a space mission from the first trip to the Moon to the first trip to Mars on one day's notice! But that one scene mentioned above still sticks with me."
2,Not as good as you remmeber,"This is one of those films that misses the ""classic"" category by a fair bit, and really is for Pal completists only. The science and humor has dated pretty badly, and the FX are pretty funny. The blue-screening on the space wheel makes it somewhat transparent along its bottom circumference. I can't believe no one noticed this, therefore I have to conclude that they let it go hoping no one would notice. Well, that hope is in vain. I can't say much for the acting, either. Still, it's a relatively painless way to spend an hour or so, and has undeniable historical significance in the ranks of sf film. I had remembered this film as being better than it actually is. Of course, the last time I saw it I was about 13 years old, and that was more than 40 years ago. Other films of the era have dated, as well, but they're lots more fun to watch. THEM, for example, or FORBIDDEN PLANET, or even INVADERS FROM MARS. Those still pack a punch. CONQUEST OF SPACE is more of a bitch-slap."
1,A Poor Movie,"I enjoy older classic sci fi movies, but this misses the mark, and does so badly. Don't waste your money."
3,Not one of George Pal's better endeavors,Living and travelling in space and the problems that arise is what the movie is about but the cheap sets and cheaper special effects date its 1954 release. The above and actors Ross Martin and William Hopper make this a cult classic.
4,Conquest of Space,"Seller gave me very good, very prompt and efficient service -- thank you!! The movie's dated but still a lot of fun, rating AAA++++."
5,How far is too far,"Absolutely priceless sci fi / documentary of all the available knowledge on space travel 1955, including smoking in space, a fantastic chase scene with an asteroid and priceless dialogue.If you are interested in the history of sci fi this is an absolute must have purchase :-)"
1,An Embarassment of Astronomical Proportion,"Stupid characters, an idiot plot and excruciatingly bad dialogue kill this turkey long before the rotten set design and bad special effects have a chance. I'm ashamed to admit I bought this one. Stay away!"
4,Useful book for learning more about derivatives,"This is a great handbook for a non specialized audience who want to go further with derivatives instruments. Enter the magic world of swaps, options and even swaptions !"
4,Excellent book for Java Development,This is one of the best books I have read to date on developing Java applications with ANT. I'd highly recomend it to anyone interested in saving time writting JAVA applications.
3,Ok,Worth getting for the low price and engineer's perspective. Gives a few case studies but would benefit with checklists. A great companion is The Expert Witness Handbook.
4,A Must-Have in Time Series Analysis,"I used this book as an undergraduate student. Although it is not an elementary book, it is very well structured so it easy to follow the train of thought of T.W. Anderson.You end learning a lot without ever noticing the effort.Drawbacks?. It's a little bit out of date, since it does not include Garch or other models for heterocedastic series, although it gives some ideas for standarizing them."
4,An essay of statistical tencniques in analizing time series,"A strong mathematical approach to time serie analysis.Sometimes a bit hard to understand, but always anindispensable asset."
2,The Art Of Confusion,"Anyone that can relate to this phrase knows the work of the Devil.1. Nick has more makeup on than Valerie. Huh?2. Nick doesn't have a wedding ring on his finger. Huh?3. Valerie sings I'm Every Woman and goes into the audience and sits in another guys lap. Huh?4. They sing a rendition with a gay guy about being in a gay club with each of them singing about a gay character. Huh?5. Nick's song was called Born This Way. Huh?People I'm sorry, maybe I'm naive but Ashford & Simpson broke my heart with this DVD. Reading between the lines you could clearly see where they were going with this. I believe that Nick had sort of a coming out of the closet party. One of the greatest songwriter duo's of all time have what I believe to be an openly flawed relationship!! No wonder Freddy Jackson was there. It hurt because I held them to such high standards. But it's just showbiz right? Huh?"
4,Wondeful Experience,"I have been a fan of Ashford and Simpson for many years, it was a pleasure to see them perform many times in concert. This DVD was not a let down, it delivered everyting I expected from an Asford and Simpson concert.With the recent passing of Nick Ashford, what an added pleasure to own a copy of one of their many performances.I look forward to the pleasure of seeing them perform on this video for many years to come."
2,not as good as i hoped for,"I love Ashford and Simpson but this video didn't do it for me. Maybe it was my lack of knowledge of the songs sang, but I was not impressed. I hate to say it but I would not buy it again if I had the chance."
5,THE THRILL IS STILL HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT,"How do they STAY FREE after 34 years of marriage, they are still SOLID. It sure doesnt show on nic's face. This is the only dvd featuring Ashford and Simpson. I have one bootleg showcase from 84, when they were on a real stage and had room to move instead of a 70 seat informal setting. Buy this to see Nic and Val without spending a fortune. Their bio answers all the top questions..like how Nic came to write I'm Every Woman.. veryy interesting..I'd know you anywhere and I will CHERISH AND ADORE this dvd for always. Some people may not like them at this age as much as back in the day..BUT IT COMES WITH THE PACKAGE..EVERY THING YOU SEE. Also the Micheal Mcdonald and friends dvd features Nic and Val in leather for those avid fans as myself."
3,SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"The Real Thing [Blu-ray] Although Nick Ashford died unexpectly last week, it doesn't change the fact that I was stunned and disappointed by a large portion of the content of the last half of the concert. I have no knowledge of whether he was or was not gay, nor do I care, but a large portion of last half consisted of non-legendary ""coming out"" songs. Val participated, as did a third unknown member of the backup entourage who appeared to be well-qualified and enjoyed to be assisting in this ""coming out"" exercise. I had been hoping to hear a concert devoted to the Ashford/Simpson musical output that had made them icons of the R&B;/Motown era for decades; they are legendary. That is certainly not what I got in this BluRay; I have watched it twice and I'll be donating it to Goodwill in the very near future."
5,"My Cats Rate Them ""Purr-Fect!""",I have two Bengal/Savannah mix cats so was looking for a large tunnel. My cats love these and have spent a lot of time playing in them! I wish the connector-tunnel was available through Amazon.
5,A little pricey but my dogs love it!,I bought this for my 2 Chiweenie's. They love it. It seems very well made and I like that it doesn't crinkle like the other cat tunnels.
5,loved it,"It's a daily exercise of hide-and-seek and running through the two tunnels tied end to end with each other for my cats. They love running through the tunnel, lying in it, stretching flat in it, squishing it. The seem-to-be flimsy material makes the tunnel collapse easily, but it also allows the cats to free themselves of it if necessary. Putting the tunnel in different places at your residence will keep the cats' curiosity of this toy at its peak all the time. Highly recommended. I might buy a few more, in fact. :)"
4,Do not like the lining,"The tunnel is fine, but I do not like the lining. It is soft, but not durable at all, very easy to be torn apart with cat's claws. This is exactly what my kitten does instead of playing Hide and Seek. She actually likes her crackel tunnel much more."
5,A real hit!,"My cats love this! I've had it for months and they never get tired of it. They sleep in it, chase each other in and around it. It's soft on the inside and sturdy. If the cats had only one toy this would definitely be the one!!"
2,Replacement Theology,"I rate this 2 stars for those that wish to emerse themselves in some reason to eliminate the Jews. Go ahead. Join the rebellion. For the Jews will survive and will (as it is written) call upon their Messiah thereby fulfilling the 'prerequisite' for the Physical return of King Jesus to destroy this rebellion and set up His Millenial Kingdom from the rebuilt Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount - Bless The Lamb of God that was Slain from The Foundation of the World. There is Nothing you can do about it, (Gods Foreknowledge declares it so) except for one thing - Repent......or (sadly) perish.Please remember that the Jews (sinners as they are - but all are sinners), are merely the vehicle by which God Almighty uses to fulfill His Redemptive purposes for His fallen Creation (you don't have a problem with the Jews but with JEHOVAH).I hope The Lord will Bless you!"
4,"Whose Land, Whose Promise",The author's personal journey and transition of thought gives him that much more credibility as he grapples with the heartrending history and current impasse in the Israel/Palestinian situation. His carefully structured and reasoned Biblical basis provides a formidable rebuttal to the Christian Zionism and Dispensationalism that has high-jacked such a large segment of American Christianity. Any clear thinking Christian - clergy and layperson - owes it to himself to be informed. Gary Burge has done us a great service.
4,"grossly interesting, an inspiring read","Having read Medusa'a Hair as part of my University coursework, I was very impressed, Most of the books we are asked to read are fairly dull but this book really captivated me. Obeyesekere's personal opinions on the subject of matted hair in Sri Lankan women attending the festival at Kataragama was facinating. He has a great way of putting across his own opinion and whilst he makes a great bridge between Weber's and Freud's philosphical standpoints, he very effectively shows his position acroos to the reader. This may seem like a difficult book to comprehend but once read will be greatly admired"
3,Medusa's Hair,"Speedy delivery, but I did not enjoy this book very much. It's very hard to get through."
3,It Was Pretty Good,"It wasn't the best ASOUE book, but it was still good. The ending made you want the next book NOW!!! But it had too much detail and too many side stories, you would have to flip a page or two to get back to the real story. Also, it was freaky and kinda too violent talking about lions devouring people. And insulting people and calling them freaks was mean. But the book was still good. I can't wait for the next one."
4,The best series EVER!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!!!!! I couldn't wait until this one came out, and my friends thought it would come out a month from now! I guess I shouldn't have told them that it came out on the 27th because they told me what happened (I told them not to). But still, this was one of the best, and i recommend everybody to read it! It is awesome, and the cliffhanger at the end is too irresistable to not think about what will happen next. I still prefer the 5th book (The Austere Academy) over this one because I read it before any of my friends did. It was also my favorite!"
5,Harry Potter without magic.,"This has all of the evil villains, surprising twists, and exiting plots that a teenager could ever ask for. With a wearwolf chasing them and a two headed freak right on their tail, their sure to be in for it. This book was the best in the series yet, but I still don't know what VFD stands for, I don't know when it'll be on, but I'm ready to find out!The way that Count Olaf as been finding out where the Baudalaires are is by this mysterious fortune teller who seems to always know everything! Also, make sure you read the rest of the eight horroble books in this horrible series or you're not going to know what this book is about! Also, if you have to have HAPPY endings DON'T get these books!"
3,Home stretch...,"Another tale that is a lot like the others. The thing I liked about this is that Sunny's utterings are getting more recognizable as words. Sometimes, Snicket quite cleverly uses French and Spanish words with some relation to 'what Sunny means by this.'At this point, I am just reading because I'd like to know the secret of V.F.D. and what happens in The End."
4,An Interesting book,"After escaping the burning hospital the Baudelaire seek refuge in a trunk of the notorious villain Count Olaf. Count Olaf has come to a rundown carnival to see a mysterious Fortuneteller known as Madam Lulu. In an effort to escape the clutches of count Olaf the Baudelaire use the wide assortment of various items inside Count Olaf's trunk. The Baudelaire disguise themselves as a two headed freak and chabo the wolf baby. The children are worried as the carnival decides to create an attraction where one freak will plunge into the lion pit to increase the carnivals publicity. In store for you in this invigorating, suspense building, and partly grousum story is a hunchback, an ambidextrous person, and a contortionist. Will the Baudelaire survive? Can they evade Count Olaf? Is Madam Lulu all that she appears? All these questions and more will be reviled in ""The Carnivorous Carnival"""
2,The Carnivorous Carnival,"The Baudelaires have escaped the fire of the hospital in the trunk of Count Olafs car and now find themselves at the Caligari Carnival where Olaf is using a psychic to gather information. Madam Lulu has been giving Olaf information on how to find the Baudelaires. Violet, Klaus and Sunny disguise themselves and become a part of this carnival and hope to gain more information about the mysterious VFD and about the fire that killed their parents. A cliffhanger ends this installation of the Series of Unfortunate Events.I am sticking with this series only because I have gotten this far. I am getting a bit bored with the books and sometimes feel I have to drag myself through until the end. Thankfully they are quite short. Then again, Im not the age group that Mr. Snicket is writing for."
5,One of the Best Yet!,"The ninth book in this series was extremely good, and answers some questions of fans of the Lemony Snicket series. A few of my questions about V.F.D. and the Quagmire triplets were answered, and I am pleased with the outcome of this book. Snicket has created another good fantasy."
5,Love it!,I am in love with the Series! Best series ever! I will be upset when I reach the last page of the thirteenth book! I will be so lost! Even if you have not read the last few books I don't think it would make a difference.. although this book was not my number one! The reptile room was my favorite.. (good book too!!)
3,Somewhat disappointed,"It took FOREVER to get here, and there was a price tag on the spine of the book. The spines of the books in this series are soft and velvety, so when I tried to remove the price tag, it ripped the spine of the book. So now there's no title on the side of the book. I really wish this was mentioned in the description, as I don't like to buy books that have a price tag on the side for this very reason. The book itself was wonderful, as are all the books in this series."
3,carnivorous carnival,"I don't know exactly why, but I found the orphans' travails to be unusually painful to read about this time. The Baudelaires disguise themselves as circus freaks in order to take jobs at the Caligari Carnival. They encounter a treacherous fortune teller whose philosophy is tell people what they want to hear, Esmee Squalor, who has become Count Olaf's girlfriend, and Count Olaf himself who tries again to get the orphans in his clutches. Literary references abound: two of the freaks are Colette, the contortionist and Huge, the hunchback. I especially got a kick out of Kevin, who isn't really a freak but considers himself to be one because of his ambidextrosity. The book also pokes fun at mob violence and pop psychology."
5,Two thumbs way up.,In my opinion this book is the third best book in the series (of the 11 books out so far.) It started you off exectly where the 8th book began. It was fast paced and interesting. We also found out how Count Olaf always known where the Baudelairs are. This was something that I hadbeen wondering for a long time. We also find out where the V.F.D headquarters are.Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Please rate wether it was helpful or not. Also remember that theese books should be read in order.
3,Dude,"What a damn letdown. First, Mr snicket keeps us waiting a year for the next darn book (what's up with that), and when he finally releases it, it's the worst book in the whole series. I'm sorry, snicket but this book just wasn't as funny or mysterious as the rest of the books. once again, the three nerdy kids are in disguise, this time a freakin' circus freaks. this book was a total letdown for me, and i think you should read this one last in the series."
5,A Joy To Read!!,"This is undoubtedly one of the best books in the ""Series of Unfortunate Events"". The plot flows smoothly, picking up directly where the eighth book left off. This volume follows everyone's favorite orphans to the Caligari Carnival, where they go for shelter, and to hide from the murderous Count Olaf. I won't give away any more of the story, since you will undoubtedly want to go and read this book now. The fact that there are nearly 300 pages is not at all an issue, even though the length may intimidate some people. Leavened by bits of humor, this story of misfortune will leave readers desirous of the next book. Although amazon.com says this is a book for ages 9-12, ... I would recommend this tale to anyone."
4,seasons of summer-fantasy books,"I, for one, think that this is a really great book. If anyone doesn't enjoy this the they REALLY don't appreciate true literature.The only thing wrong with this series is that after 8 books you get to wondering....when is this book going to end?I mean, it CAN'T end badly.Sooner or later they've got to find their parents!"
4,"Might as well call the 11th chapter ""The Glorious Gorefest.""","But aside the violence, it is a fine book.Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are hiding in the trunk of the automobile that Count Olaf owns. He is heading over to ""Caligari Carnival"" to see Madame Lulu, who is a ""fortune teller.""You should know a few details about the book, mainly a freak show, three starving lions, a nasty crowd of people, two various disguises, and Beverly and Elliot, the two-headed freak.But this book is miserable, so please think twice about ordering it."
4,MORE FUN IN A CARNIVAL THIS TIME,"""The CArnivourous Carnival"" - Accused of murder and on the run from Count Olaf, The Kids find their way to the Caligari where Madame Lulus House of Freaks employs the kids as a sideshow attraction with vilot and Klaus playing a two headed freak and Sunny playing a Wolf baby. The kids continue to unravel more of the mystery about their parents.This was maybe the weakest of the 9 books so far. Not bad at all, but the kids didn't seem quite as clever as we have come accustomed to seeing. Still quite a fun ride!"
5,"A Good Find, and a Great Read.","If you read the series up to this point, the orphins are in the trunk of olafs car. They mainly talk (alot) in the first chapter (and the chapters are long), They later end up in a parking lot at Caligari Carnivle. Home of Madam LuLu. She is a fortune teller, and you find out that she is the one who tells Count Olaf where the orphins. The orphins disquise as Freaks, because the carnivle has a freak house. Oh wait, i almost forgot. For those who read the book before, you know VFD? Well they find out what it is. But you know what?... Im gonna tell you nothing of what it is. But let me just say that one orphin gets traped and the other two are in trouble. Well i got to get out of the belly of the beast.With all due respect,A Respectful Reader"
3,getting boring,"I waited a long time for this book to come out and I even spent a few weeks rereading the rest of the series just so I could fully understand everything that would go on in the book and hopefully solve some of the mysteries. But I am sad to say that all that time I spent preparing for this book is hopelessly lost. I had my hopes up that Lemony Snicket might finaly be able to tie up some of the loose ends having to do with the Baudelaire parents, VFD, and Jacqes Snicket. Although this was a good book, I just don't think it was up to Lemony Snicket's standard. It seemed like there weren't enough major events or findings in the story to make it a good book (it gave me the impression that maybe this book was created as a transition from Book 8 to Book 10). I personaly, am getting bored with waiting to find out about the mysteries. Hopefully we will find out some more imformation in The Slipery Slope, or maybe Lemony Snicket won't be getting as many eager return readers."
3,Nothing to cry about.,Plot: yawn.Entertainment: fine page turner.Suspense: present.Hidden messages: plenty.Purpose: to introduce VFD mysteries.
2,Very Dissapointing...,"After 4 FANTASIC books (5-8), which were a BIG step up from the first half of the series, I was expecting alot from this book...UNFORTUNATLY I was greatly dissapointed. I was SO excited when this came out, and even more so that I had the advantage of getting it early, due to this years book-fair...I don't know what it was...maybe its that the whole things getting old...I mean, it's pretty much the same thing book after book...you know, they move to a new location, Count Olaf has a new disguise (or,in this case, the Baudelaires), yadda,yadda,yadda...Or it may be because awhile after reading book 8, I lost my intrest in the series and charectors, and went toward others...<sigh>, well despite what happend here, I will read maybe the next 2, and see if I like them..."
5,I haven't read this book yet but I will!,. And A Golden Compass has it's moments but mightn ot be for everyone.
3,#9 disappoints as well as keeps you interested in #10,"The children dunt seem as smart,witty and quick as hay have been in previous stories. THe new characters are very interesting. As e dont get to see some of our past favs-Mr Poe and quagmire twins. Some +'s about #9-we find out about VFD. The end is so unbelievable...it'll keep u interested in the series as i think the series has hit a little low."
5,Lemony Snicket's best book out,"The Carnivorous Carnival is Lemony's best book out! I have read them all and it is the best one, It has more pages but is great to read. Lemony put alot of drama in the book and surprises you with things. Warning: Not a book for people who like happy stories!"
5,Carnivorous Carnival,I read The Carnivorous Carnival. It is a great book because it tells lots of things about how Count Olaf found the children in the previous books. It also has lots of interesting parts of stuff that I was wondering about throughout the other books. It is very cool. I think others would like this book but before you read this book it would be better to read the other books in the series so you will understand this book. I recommend this book to people that are 8 and up. I think you should read The Carnivorous Carnival because it is a great book.
5,The Carnivorous Carnival,"The Carnivorous Carnival is probably one of the most exciting of the Unfortunate Events Series. In this book, the Baudelaires, still on the run, have disguised themselves into freaks, now working at the mysterious Madame Lulu's House of Freaks. Also, one clue...Madame Lulu is the one who uses her magic crystal ball to tell Count Olaf where the Baudelaires are, and she's right every time. How does she do that? I highly suggest reading the book. The Carnivorous Carnival was so suspenseful, I finished it in one night."
3,the greatest review ever,"Do you like mystery and exciting books? If you do then you should read the Series of Unfortunate Events books. These books are written by Lemony Snicket and illustrated by Brett Helquist. One of my favorite books of this series is the Carnivorous Carnival. I like this book as one of my best because this book gives a very good description of what is happening in the scene. Like when count Olaf first came to the carnival, the Baudilaire children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny were frightened because they thought that count Olaf was here because he knew they were there. The good part about why the children weren't caught was because they were disguised to be in Madam Lulu's House of Freaks. This was one of the scenes that i could picture right when i started to read this part of this book. This is why I like the book the Carnivorous Carnival and recommend it to you."
4,The Carnivorus Carnival,"...What i think this book really is is that it is a book just to set up future books. There is no plot except Voilet and Klaus trying to stay alive. Although this book has no plot it is quiet interesting. They dress up as freaks so that they can spy on Count Olaf at a Carnival. This book contains Lions, Freaks, Villians, and Surrow. It sounds like a tipical Series of Unfortuante Events.So in Conclusion i would read this book so you can get perpared for the future books and to read the interesting details that Daniel Handler always includes with his marvelous books. Good but not his best."
4,Enjoyable Entry in the Series,"I'm an adult reader who really enjoys this inventive series. The CARNIVOROUS CARNIVAL is another terrific entry - much better than #8 in the series (""The Hostile Hospital""). This time around, the Beaudelaires are chasing Count Olaf in order to get information about VFD and the potential whereabouts of their parents. They disguise themselves to hide from Count Olaf and his troup. It's a great twist in the series, although I really liked the early entries where the family was sent to live with a different foster parent each time. Overall, however, this book is another great entry in a series of excellent books. Highly recommended for young readers as well as adults who enjoy well-written, darkly humorous books."
3,The carnivores Carnival,"Hi, I'm a big Lemony Snicket but this book just didn't do it for me. The Carnivores Carnival needs some work. The story line is good but it could use some work. It gets kind of boring, he needs new and excite ding things that u don't expect. Don't get me wrong I like all he's books just needs some work. Have one of the kids get separated from he's remaining family. Also get some new villains and new friends. I rate this book a three in a half, so if like old story lines with some new things read these books."
5,Good book,This is a good book. If one follows the rules in the book they will definitely increase their speed.
1,At least two reasons to avoid this product,"What can go wrong with such a simple product? There are only two parts, and tworeasons to avoid it.1) The water vessel is made of plastic that does not conduct heat.Since heat is not transfered from the radiator to water in the vessel,evaporation is not done well...2) Hooks are made for very narrow radiators (less than 2"" from the edge to the center).If your radiators are wider, you'll have to make your own hooks to hang the vessel.But it won't help you due to 1)...It's a cheap, but totally non-functional product..."
1,What a hoax,"Purchased 5 Snow Joe radiator humidifiers which arrived very soon after the order and in plenty of time for the East Coast blizzard and freeze. For starters, they are a profoundly ugly, charcoal gray eyesore in most any space but a coal mine. The ridges on the back side did not match the pipes on the radiator and the hangers did not fit without force, making them very difficult to install and remove. We were worried about applying too much pressure because the hangers are held in place by a plastic tab which did not seem strong enough. We filled them as directed, anticipating humidity to increase warmth. Two weeks later, very little water had evaporated, and green scum had developed. I used filtered water to prevent mold. I place the humidifiers in 5 separate rooms and the net result was the same.The cost of the humidifiers was a waste and the house is still an old house heated by expensive-to-fill and circulate radiators. the $50 dollars would have been better spent on the heating bill."
1,Poor Overall Design,Doesn't really work. Plastic construction doesn't conduct heat enough to evaporate enough water to make a difference. Plus the hooks it comes with are a joke. I have really run of the mill radiators and the hooks don't even come close to fitting. I rigged it up with some wire but that doesnt fix the plastic construction problem. Total waste of money.
3,"Adequate, but now exactly what I needed","The humidifiers are made for small radiators not the larger standard size, so the ""ribbing"" doesn't line up correctly. Also the wire hangers are too small for a larger radiator so I had to improvise my own with other wire."
3,Snow Joe Radiator Humidifier,The Snow Joe is essentially the same as I have been using for years. They would be more effective if they were made of metal in order to conduct heat better and therefore put more moisture in the air.A major problem with them are the hooks they supply. They would be fine for a very thin radiator but the average old radiators are much thicker (more depth) and the hooks do not fit. I had to make hooks from wire hangers in order to use them. The old version of the humidifiers came with larger hooks and were bendable as needed.
2,Hooks too small,"The reservior is a little on the small side, but the killer is that the hooks supplied are only for very small radiators. They will not work with larger NYC apartment ones. Hopefully the manufacturer will address this."
5,A must for both casual and hardcore Costello fans!,"Finally, a tribute album worthy of the man's songwriting talents! A daring collection of mostly independent artists, who were not afraid to make interesting choices. It delves deep enough into his catalogue to satisfy the Costello nut, and has reinterpretations of old favorites. Do yourself a favor...buy this CD...you won't be disappointed!"
1,I Threw this Out with the Bag it Came in,"When I looked at the excellent song choices on the cover, I thought ""I don't know these bands, but they have excellent taste in music."" Then I played it. Some of the worst audio I have every heard. Very poorly done covers, some atrocious vocals, and boring because they just copy the original arrangements. I need to hear someone else singing ""Alison"" the same way? All of these sound like the artists are playing along with the radio. File this under community theater of rock."
2,Be Warned,"Elvis Costello is an amazing writer/arranger and it becomes clearer than ever on this so-called tribute album. Some of the covers are OK and some are just plain bad. Personally, I think if you're going to cover songs by another artist you need to bring something to the table. This band of mostly Texas-based performers don't bring much but a little southern twang and Elvis's songs are too complicated for the level of musicianship displayed here. If you're a DIE HARD Costello fan (as I am) the best thing you can say about this disk is that it's unique. EC deserves better."
4,A little bit country...,"I had been warned that this compilation veered toward country (not my favorite genre), but I'm glad I took the risk and bought it anyway. There certainly is a southern feel (7 of 15 songs were recorded in Austin), but only two or three of the tracks are what I would call country. The covers come from 9 different Costello albums and really showcase his diverse talent. A strong recording, this collection is sure to make you dig out your old records (or buy the ones you've missed) just to hear what elvis' versions sound like! ""Beyond Belief"" is a particularly beautiful cover."
3,Not so great,"I'm really trying trying to like this CD. A few of the songs really do stand out...but what's with the songs by Kev Russell's Junker?? They totally ruined and in my opinion made a mockery of what is one of my favorite E.C. songs of all time (Indoor Fireworks). Just awful. Terrible.I do like some of the renditions on here, such as Hem's ""(the angel's wanna wear my) Red Shoes,"" Matt Pond PA's ""Green Shirt,"" and Jon Auer's ""Beyond Belief."" Some of the other songs are starting to grow on me, some of them I know never will.The album is still worth owning for (at least) the few songs I mentioned, just have your remote handy and be prepared to skip over a number of them as they are unlistenable."
4,Solid Session,"Not all that much music on here, but what is here is beautifully arranged and played, and Evidence did a great job on the mastering. It's a good Ra session where he arranges other people's compositions. I brought this out of mothballs yesterday, and quite enjoyed it."
5,Their first-love that cover!,"George Tomsco and the fabulous Fireballs provided fans with a half dozen wonderful instrumentals and a half dozen vocals on this excellent album. ""Torquay"" and ""Bulldog"" are on everyone's list of greatest instrumentals and ""Panic Button"" is not far benind! As for the vocals, Chuck Tharp never achieved great fame, but tunes such as ""Let There Be Love"" will grow on you as they did me. And three bonus tracks that were not on the original album make this an extremely good bargain. The cover is one of the all-time most appropriate album designs!"
5,Revisiting the past,My husband loved reading this book again. He had read it 60 years ago while stationed in Japan. He learned some new customs and habits of military families and really enjoyed revisiting a time in his life when he fell in love with the culture and the people. He was thrilled to find it on Amazon when the library did not have it and referred him to Amazon as source.
4,Perfect snack for kids and moms alike!,"As a snack lover, these bite sized cereal nuggets satisfy my sweet tooth. They are also a low-cal way to snack mid-morning or mid-afternoon. I like the vanilla flavor most of all. If they weren't so much like candy, I would have ranked them five stars. My [...] eats it for breakfast--and says it taste like ice cream. Good for her and she likes it!"
4,People of the Dancing Sky,"While the photos are nice, I would rather have seen more of a focused narrative rather than the scattered glimpses of these people. It is a shame that the photographer fell into the Curtis style of posing people in inauthentic contexts, such as the little boys playing lacrosse in their gustowehs. Teachers using this book are forwarned to read carefully the preface explaining the differences in traditional Iroquoian dress styles and the pow wow dresses or contemporary modern dance costumes shown in this book. It was otherwise fun to see so many people I know. I hope to see more books written by, photographed by, Native Peoples. I would still recommend it, but use it carefully if you are an educator."
5,A great look at Nigel's F1 career with some nice insights,"'Our Nige' is one of Britain's all time F1 heroes, and a video comprising the crucial moments from his 30 victories of the era makes for a must for fans. You see his wheel-to-wheel duel with Ayrton Senna in Spain 1991, his superb duels with Nelson Piquet in 1986 and 87's British races, doubtless hugely memorable to those who were there, and lots more. The interview sections with Murray Walker (a legend in his own right) are interesting and make a great package for fans."
3,Marketing for Dummies,"This was a quick purchase in that I was attempting to gain some valuable information while doing a marketing plan for my MBA. Although interesting, it did not provide the level of information I needed to write a thorough marketing plan. I will admit that it did explain some marketing concepts for me that my text book made overly complicated. So, it has real value in understanding general marketing concepts. It is less valuable for indepth explanations or indepth planning. I would definitely say it will remain in my library for future reference."
2,Don't bother with the Kindle Edition,"I didn't read carefully enough. The kindle edition doesn't include the information contained on the CD Rom that comes with the print copy. That includes all the templates, budgeting plans and countless other items. The book is helpful but basic the real tools are left out of the Kindle edition."
3,Marketing Kit for Dummies,"Marketing Kit for Dummies is a wonderful book to have, especially for those of us that have never done any marketing before. I couldn't live without it trying to run small business and market our products. I use it everyday!"
3,Lots of How to Materials but Practical?,"Each chapter has worksheet and to do list, but you have to evaluate the relevancy to your business and the personality to do it. Networking is the best suggestion but not everyone is good at it. Speaking from personal experience, practice, practice, my friend. I didn't finish the book because I didn't feel like doing the worksheets and exercises."
1,Trivia book falls on it's face,This book was way to easy... I was expecting it to be more challenging... But when half the answers are Hulk Hogan...
5,They are the best dancers and instructors around - buy this!,"Steve and Heidi are not only two of the most accomplished and champion dancers they are truly phenomenal instructors. All of their instructional tapes were put together wonderfully and professionally. They will dance each move in it's entirety to music, they break it down simply and include counts if you want them. Then finish by demonstrating all the moves strung togehter to music so you can see what the moves might actually look like on a reall dance floor. If you are a beginner, or advanced dancer you will not be disappointed. Not to mention that they are super nice people and actively teaching around the world, so if you have an opportunity to study with them grab it!"
5,It's About Time,"Anybody who owned this original LP and the subsequent shoddy transfers on CD (if you can find them still) can now rest at ease. Finally someone has taken the original LP and released it exactly as it was - complete original Nat Hentoff liner notes - The real cover of the LP, and finally the real title!! But the best news here is the remastering job - An amazing recording to begin with, finally sounds amazing on CD. It's about time! SMOKIN' HOT !!"
5,The Best of Big Band Sound,"This recording is the ultimate stereophonic recording of the Big Band sound. The sound of the Big Band does not come any better and natural sounding than this recording. All the players are great, in their prime, and were ready to play at the studio in Long Island City, New York. Most importantly and also as great are the arrangements by the late great Neal Hefti. It is a real important message within the sound project when Neal Hefti was involved."
1,disapointing album by Woody Herman,I've got to tell you when I got this cd I thought it was Tito Puente and Woody Herman and when I listened to it I was disapointed because 6 songs were done by Herman and the 5 were done by Herman and Puente the reason I got it is because I thought the whole album was them together. So I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this album. Don't get this cd.
3,Frustration lies in the details,"I have enjoyed a number of Ames's step-by-step drawing books and was excited to find this one. However, I was somewhat disappointed in it. Here's why. Whereas Ames's other books show completed pictures very much like what I could produce by simply following the steps, in this book, the final results are invariably much more polished with shading and shadowing. That's not a problem in itself, except that Ames provides no instruction or steps which show how to accomplish those additional details. Thus, my frustration. I want my final results to resemble Ames's as closely as possible, but I'm not told how to achieve this. Otherwise, the basic steps are, as always, useful and easy. Just don't expect to learn the details here, even though they are shown in the final picture."
1,Starhawk bombs,"I have all, and I do mean all of Maloney's books. I think the last 3 books in the Wingman series has dwindled to little more than a tired effort of the writer. He has clearly tried to go in directions that would lead to more sales rather than continuing a believable quality. He is reaching to find a connection to his earlier books and falling way, way short. I do hope he is not ""farming out"" the books to other writers. If he is, he needs to re-evaluate his decision and get back on track. I simply want the type of books he began with. The line of fiction he is currently trying is more like fantasy than fiction. Only one good spot in this book. If you start in the middle and quit about 30 pages later you will like this book. If you read more than that it is no doubt the worst book this author has written. I look forward to the author getting his feet back to reality. I will continue to buy his books but I sure hope they improve."
1,Displeased customer.,"I think that there should be an option of supplying this book with zero stars rather than one. I don't think that this book should be under any popular online book store, that has talented writers, because this book doesnt classify under any acceptable reading material. I do not reccomend this book for further reading."
1,Not So Great,"I was disappointed in this book. I found the characters to be black and white (e.g., Mom and Sis were bad; the author was good) and the writing didn't ring true. I felt more empathy for the author when she was writing about her terminally ill sons than about her feelings about her mother and sister."
4,pretty good,"Man, I actually kind of liked this movie. Started a little odd with freeze shots and stuff, but once it got going, there was pretty good suspense. Plus Rebecca Neuenswander is really great in this - actually everyone did well. Probably worth renting before buying to make sure."
4,Excellent Independent Movie,"I watch a lot of independent films. Typically you can tell that they are independent either by the low-grade filming, all outdoor shots, or worthless actors who can't make it in community theatre. It's no easy task, but if those things work for you, you still usually have to be forgiving with issues with story or continuity, but these things are not an issue with ""Fight Night"".The start of the film is a bit messy... the cinematography doesn't settle down for a while and there's too much ""effect"" for effect sake. But soon the lead actors present a story well enough that you soon move pass the effects and start paying attention to the story. It's a shame that neither star has other credits to their name that I can find... they should definitely be holding our attention in more movies."
1,late and wrong,"It took 9 days longer to receive then the lastest shipment date stated. When it finally arrived,it was the wrong product and being so late it was already past the return date. Maybe that is the secret. Ship it late so no one can return it. Not a good experience. Back to real stores were you aren't buying a picture,but the actual product."
1,Blood of Beasts,This DVD was a serious D rated movie. If I buy or go to the theatre I will watch the movie all the way through no matter what. I made it through the thirty minutes before I could not take it anymore. If you like real cheesy and bad movies this is the one for you. WaltBlood of Beasts
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,"The plot of this movie has holes so large Viking longships can easily sail through them. Those holes do not reflect the horrid script. This is not to mention the bikini clad Vikings in one shot or the laughable special effects. The special effects are so bad, they are reminicent of a highschool play. Still, the movie could have still achieved a campy or cult-following quality if the acting were not so bad. I gave my copy away and it is now used to have Mystery Theater 3000 style nights."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"I have no idea how anyone could give this horrible waste a rating better than 1 star. 1 star in generous for this movie, but they don't allow less. The best way I found to describe this movie is a digital romance novel. If you actually enjoy romance novels, you might.... might actually like this thing. Otherwise stay far away!!!"
1,C Movie,"strange, Jane March (main character; big picture on the cover) is not mentioned in the cast listing... the ""clan"" apparently consists of 2 women and 6 or 8 guys. they do a have a real, miniature ship, however."
2,Why bother???,"I'll never understand how some films get made. This film is a fine example why certain films should never get produced. The concept in and of itself (Vikings meet Beauty and the Beast) is decently conceived and had potential. However, the only real thing this film had going for it is the Nordic theme. But this movie was hamfistedly produced, uninspired costumes and sets, boring filmscore, terrible acting, and more. Word of advice to all aspiring filmmakers. If you don't have the material to make a good movie, don't make it!!!"
2,Blood Of Beasts,"This movie was pretty bad.The beast looked something out of a highschool play.Horribale costume!You could totally tell that the men were wearing wigs execpt for Eric.I think that was his real hair for the most part.Maybe he had extensions in.I did like the story,about the beauty and the beast.I also did like the viking setting and I didn't think the costumes were to bad.I also like Justin Whalin in this movie.He really looked good with the long hair.This movie could have been done so much better!"
1,Blood of Beasts,Definitely a 'B' rated kind of movie. Not the worst we've ever seen but more like something you'd watch on TV if there was nothing else on at the time.
2,Beauty and the Beast: The Viking Version,"This is just a new retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story set in the Viking world. The acting, writing and overall design of the movie is just bad. It's just like watching a bad movie on the Sci-Fi Channel. The ONLY reason I bought this movie is because I am a fan of the Beautiful Jane March. If you are a fan of Hers then get it, but if you are not then don't waste your money."
3,blood of beasts,I found the movie a little slow in action. It could have a lot more potential to be a great film.
1,AAAugh.... horrible movie.,"The only good actor and redeeming quality of this movie would be Jane March. The set piece look like they were taken from a high school play, the wigs on some of the warriors looked like jokes and the actors don't even re-act realistically. Watch this movie with friends, have a few beers and be ready to make fun of this horrible movie."
1,Bad fantasy done poorly,"I had hopes for ""Blood of Beasts,"" upon seeing the cover. The information presented on the back cover seemed interesting enough. Maybe it was the clever LOTR-inspired cover art combined with the natural beauty of Jane March that allured me to rent this drek.Basically, it's ""Beauty and the Beast"" set in the curiously warm Viking world. Scientists have told me there was a period of global warming about 800 years ago, but palm trees in Norway? It must be true, because they didn't have enough lumber to make a real Viking boat. Two weeks voyage on that glorified canoe?So there's little point in telling you the rest of this story, because you've probably seen the Disney movie, which was a lot better.If you want a real Viking story, get ""The 13th Warrior."""
3,Not too bad until the end,"I love Beauty and the Beast, but I think I'll stick with Disney from now on. The idea for this wasn't bad. I was enjoying it, really, despite the not so great acting and my doubts about historical truths, until the end. If I ever do pop this DVD in again I'm so skipping the last two minutes! It made my last 1hr and 20 some minutes pointless."
3,OK,The movie itself was not bad. The quality of the DVD is!! Not a clear picture very low quality. One would expect better quality on DVD not so with this movie it is snowy all the time. I would have gave it better marks if not for that.
2,Lighthouse puzzle,"I am normally a huge fan of Jeff Wilke's puzzles. I have most of them and love them very much, but for whatever reason, they changed the cut style of this particular puzzle and it is extremely difficult and no fun at all. I am an avid puzzle enthusiast and have done more puzzles than I can count and I just didn't like the way every piece is almost the exact same shape."
3,IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.,EH! I HEARD HIM IN PERSON AND ENJOYED HIS PLAYING (THE SELECTIONS) MUCH MORE THAN THE ONES ON THIS C.D.
5,Great Book,"Without a doubt The Last American Man is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. Elizabeth Gilbert makes a good case for Eustace as the last American man, but while doing so she denies him of the title.At first Gilbert makes Eustace out to be a respectable woodsman with the honorable job of trying to save the superficial materialistic America from its current path and lead it to a more natural existence.As the book progresses, though, the reader finds that Eustace is arrogant, cold-hearted, and drives anyone seeking his way of life away from him as if they are not capable of or don't deserve it.Gilbert, though, seems to glorify Eustace in his actions which is somewhat disturbing.This book is a good easy read. Gilbert offers a peak into the life of a complex, confusing, and yes definitely American man.Do yourself a favor and read this book."
3,Redundant story & a little boring!,"Well, I seem to have trouble finishing this book. While it is somewhat interesting, it is very redundant of a man who cannot function in modern society. Who would ride a horse across the country just to see how fast it could be done without smelling the beautiful roses along the way? Is this man boring, or what? True, he is a mountain man, but where is his soul? Where is the warmth of the character.The Eat, Pray Love story by Elizabeth was wonderful, even Commitment was at least the final act of this story, but it too morphed into endless research stuff that I found boring."
4,The Last American Man,"I really enjoyed this!! This is written by a friend of Eustace Conway, and you get the sense that nobody but a trusted friend would have this kind of access to such a unique individual. However, even though it is a friend, it is brutally honest. I went back and forth between wanting to sell everything I have and move to Turtle Island to thinking, ""What an IDIOT!!!! He must be the most infuriating man alive."" But a fascinating biography of a fascinating person - it also really makes you think about how we live, what we take for granted, and what we need to focus on. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves a great bio of a quirky, one-of-a-kind person, and for anyone who loves nature/outdoors, etc."
4,Understanding others,This book was interesting to see how others perceive how we waste things here on the earth. To understand the dedicated some men can have about preserving the environment. Was well written and held ones attention while reading.
2,The Last American Man,"After reading ""The Last American Man"" written about Eustace Conway, I have come to the conclusion that I strongly dis-liked this book. The book starts off well but takes a dramatic turn for the worse. The reason in my opinion is that the author has a romantic relationship with Eustace Conway. At certain points it seems that she almost worships him, which I think is sick."
5,great book,eustace conway is my hero. read this book and you will see why. he will be yours too. he's a jerk in some ways but all in all an inspiring guy.
1,Not my type of book,"I would not recommend this book to people who do not share the interest of Eustace Conway. If you're not into buying land, saving the environment, riding on horse back jsut to beat the world record and not for enjoyment then this book is not for you. I will admit there were some interesting parts in the book that were interesting but I honestly was put to sleep by most of it. It could haven been the fact that most of the things talked in the book just didnt interest me. I'm sure if you would have liked the topic you would like the book. I think most of it had to do with the way Gilbert protrays Eustace in the book. She treats him like hes ""holier than thou"". I know what he is striving/wishing for is important; however, there are differnt ways to go about it than the way that he was."
2,The Last American Man,"Interesting story badly told. Gilbert has done better though I credit the honesty she put forth her writing slipped from great to nearly unreadable as she dragged on for pages about 60's utopian visions or skimmed names of numerous of Conway's women. Gilbert made broad sweeping assumptions on things she seems to have no authority and wrote her voice, not just her character so deeply into the story that it was invasive. This was distracting, and dissapointing because she is a far better writer than this work reflects and the story deserved great depth."
5,"An artful portrait, pores, nosehairs and all","I began reading this believing it to be a work of fiction. And I couldn't believe the story of Eustace Conway, modern day mountain man in his deerskin clothes. And I thought the back story--how his parents were raised, and how that affected him--was too much, the narrator too all-knowing. Around page 70, I read on the back that it was a true story. Then it became unbelievable in the sense that the author had accumulated such details and put together such a complete portrait. And Eustace is a fascinating enough character to defy belief. This is as engaging a biography as they come."
3,Too much Gilbert in a book about Conway!,"Worth the read, but not excellent. It is essentially a biography of Eustace Conway by a NY woman who obviously wants him. If she didn't make this so obvious, by talking about how ""hot"" he is, I'd like it better. She also feels the need to intersperse ""goddamn"" and ""f*#$in"" in phrases to emphasize a point, but I found it to be overkill and somewhat immature for a published author."
4,Engaging read about a complicated man,"I enjoyed this book and its mix of personal story, historical background, and insight into a complicated man who comes off to me as earnest, if nothing else (although many aspects of his lifestyle are upsetting). Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is very readable, even when she's giving historical information rather than describing Eustace Conway's lifestyle and philosophy. Other reviews say Gilbert puts Eustace on a pedestal and doesn't convey enough of his dark side, but her friendship and admiration of his ideals is true to her, and I don't feel like she completely romanticizes him. I found his methods of ""living off the land"" and his difficulty with personal relationships to be disturbing, but it feels true to the nature of Eustace Conway and his life. I do wish the story had been told more chronologically, as I often got a little lost and wasn't sure what phase of his life Gilbert was describing. But overall, a good, well-written read that keeps me thinking."
4,A different kind of biography,"This is the biography of a man who has spent his whole life in the woods, living off the land. The difference between him and the many others who live off the land? He has flourished. Plus, he does it partially to convince others to give up the trap of luxury and return to a simple nature-centric lifestyle. The author gives us a solid background then weaves interesting tales about the ""last american man"" and how hardworking and different he is compared to an average man. A well-written book that drags a little in the end reiterating the same dogma that keeping up with the joneses is futile. However Elizabeth Gilbert hadn't quite polished off her writing style as she does in Eat, Pray, Love. A worthy read for anyone disinterested in suburban sprawl along with Into The Wild."
4,Very interesting! Wonderfully written!,"I really enjoyed this book. It gave an unbiased account of a man, who even in his best intentions, falls short of what he wants to be. Contrary to some of the negative reviews, Gilbert DOES see all that is not right about this man, and she tells us about it.This book is a journey through the mind and heart of a troubled man and those people who were raptured by his personality and then inevitably disappointed. I loved it!"
5,Man for All Seasons,"GREAT STUFF, people -- a fast, engaging read that has WOWED everyone I've recommended it to. Elizabeth Gilbert pulls off an amazing trick, writing a subjective biography with the flair of a true [objective] journalist. As a story, I thought I had learned everything there was to know about Eustace Conway, and then: wham. Another astonishing revelation. Every chapter or so we find out more about someone we thought we knew everything about--no mean feat, and wildly compelling. Look up the definition of ""page turner"" in the dictionary and this book should be pictured.And then there is Eustace. As complex and transparent a character as you could possibly imagine, at times endearing, at times frustrating, and always fascinating. I hope he hasn't been bombarded by tourists wanting to get a look at what may indeed be The Last American Man."
3,disappointed,"Hoping to find a true primitivist community. Instead, I find a man who is so driven by his demons he turned himself into a workoholic primitive farmer. What exactly does he want to show the world??!! That workoholism is awful in that setting too? It seems to me that Eustace lost his way long ago. A shame, because the man clearly has mythical dimensions, and his strength, endurance and capability are mindboggling and awe-inspiring.Just think how much more powerful his example would be if he really lived what he preaches: true simplicity, a hunter/gatherer/minimalist gardener lifestyle as much as is possible today, and preserving the land that came into his hands. Gentleness with other humans would not be amiss either. Maybe if he gave himself time to hang in the hammock more often than not, he would be capable of it.Instead, we have just another project-mad pioneer, working like a slave to alter his paradise forever for the worse thru endless infernal busyness."
4,The Last American Man,"Well, The book is well written by Elizabeth Gilbert, It provides a little more information about Eustes Conway than we get from the history channel but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,A fascinating mirror,"This book is more than the biography of an American eccentric. It allows us to look at our own, peculiarly American, mythologies through the lens of one person's life. Many American men aspire to the kind of skills and challenges that Eustace Conway provides for himself. We have a long tradition of reinventing ourselves by way of trials-by-nature. And we are running up to the end of an oil-based economy that has given many Americans unprecedented freedom and mobility, as well as the luxury of ignoring the limitations imposed by natural systems. It is good that Gilbert, with her gentle sense of humor, has documented Conway's achievements and philosophy for us by way of the durable technology of the written book. It may come in handy in years to come."
1,A biography of a man on a pedestal,For our class we had to read this book. At first it looked interesting but the book went down hill quickly. You will often find the writer rambling about one thing or another and when she is not you usually hear about him arguing with someone or being abusive to someone; and after that Elizabeth Gilbert seems to defend his abusive behavior. This is not just my opinion; everyone in the class agreed that this man is as abusive as his father and how Elizabeth Gilbert seems to try to put him in a better light. It was highly speculated in our group that Elizabeth Gilbert overly idealized Eustace Conway or was in love with him which is not a professional stance to take when writing a biography of someone.The best thing of this book was when I found out my views of this man and the writer are the same views as everyone else in the class.
1,"bias, bad writing","Conway's story is interesting and controversial. I, however, cannot stand the way it was written. Gilbert shows major bias in every story about how AMAZING Conway is. It reminds me of when my Grandma talks about me. It is interesting that in one of the reviews Gilbert is compared to Krakuer--there is no comparison. Krakuer tells a truthful story from a neutral bias. Nowhere in Into the Wild does he say McCandless is ""what every American man wants to be"". Krakuer lets you make that decision on your own. Further, Conway is not what I want to be--out of touch and unrealistic. I wish Krakuer had written this book so I could at least enjoy the story, not be frustrated with the author for ruining it."
4,interesting,"I would recommend this book because I learned a lot about how the simple life can sometimes not be so simple. At a first glance it seems as though Eustace is doing something great and wonderful that will finally make him happy. However, everything that he does, he has to do so perfectly. Eustace almost sucks the fun out of his own life. All of the adventures and great accomplishments are wonderful but he never takes the time to enjoy them. Eustace's life is extremely interesting especially because he is so passionate about everything he does. He does almost everything he wants but doesn't find joy in them. Another interesting part of the book is the fact that Eustace says that he lives this simple life yet he makes money and buys a lot of land. Also, Eustace says that anyone can live their life this way but apprentice after apprentice leave because they can't handle it, or Eustace. This book is extremely interesting when you look at it critically and find the contradictory."
2,Last American Man,I thought the book was very interesting. Being a outdoor enthusiast it locked me in from the being. Stories of the Appalachian trail were bizare and entertaining. I wish he would not have turned out to be such a perfectionist like his Dad. It seemed at times that he was more interested in making money than living in the wild. Maybe the book would have been better if it did not go into the boring details of buying land and his search for a dream girl. At the end I did feel the same on some of his points on getting back into the wild.
1,Broken,"Read within these pages the effects of extreme mental and emotional abuse upon a child and the way it plays out as an adult. Eustace is a broken human. His unfortunate treatment at the hands of his father seriously crippled him. People who have suffered like Eustace are often over-achieving, perfectionists; unable to maintain relations with others; either oblivious to the needs of others or slavishly catering to the whims of others and they almost always come to closley resemble the abuser.Big Eustace was a denizen of the office and the classroom- liked to write out long equations and ramble on to hear the sound of his own voice, so little Eustace subcociously chose a path 180 degrees away from father and becomes a creature of the forest but ended up rambling in his classroom just the same, just a different subject.To me this was an eminently sad tale of a boy going to any length for father's notice and approval. Neither of which came at least by the conclusion of this book.Eutace-walk away."
2,"Poor book, great writer","The good: Gilbert is a truly fantastic writer - her vocabulary, grammar, style and tone are truly wonderful and a joy to read. She has an exceptional ability to vary the tempo of her prose and her literary voice is unique and brilliant.The bad: As good a writer as she is, this is a poor book for one reason. Instead of a taking a character (in Eustace) and simply telling his story, Gilbert has taken her idealogy of what Eustace represents and built his character around that. In short, the writing is biased. I had never heard of Eustace Conway until I read the book but even I can tell that she is attempting to push some kind of agenda."
2,Disappointment,"I loved this fragrance at the store, but I would have to agree with one of my colleagues that it smells better on the blotter. Scent disappears almost as soon as you walk out the door."
2,It Was The 70s,"The time was the early 70s. The place was the United States. The people who bought this book were the counter culture, ""lets all feel good"" crowd.Those days are gone but this book lives on in resale shops. A good book for people just beginning to crawl out from under the self-hatred of doing drugs and other destructive behavior. Yeah, it was pop psychology but back then the ideas in this little easy-to-read book had hardly ever been mentioned before at least not by everyday people. The ideas still ring true today even though most people take this stuff for granted and we read the same things in a more sophisticated way. If you would like to see what prompted the politically correct ideas that are all over todays culture The TA Primer is one of the books you'll want to start with."
4,"Simple, But Not For Sissies","T/A (and this instructional little book) are not for dyed-in-the-wool victims or spoiled brats, but very helpful for those who want to take charge of their life and become real grown-ups.The principles are timeless but shunned in the USA because the USA has become what we call a Nanny State: the people want to remain immature and powerless, and have the government take care of everything.""By understanding how we use our 3 personas and how we react to other people's personas and they ours, we can help others, as well as ourselves, feel ""OK""""""You will have more opportunities to love and do what you really want to do when you know how and why you use your inner PARENT, ADULT, and CHILD personas every day."""
3,Enjoyable rhythms,"As usual, the Warp Brothers create an extremely well done and seamless mix with the material presented. The liner claims this was the Warp Brothers first mix CD after their initial success with 'Phatt Bass' and the track selection on this mix CD seems to show their inexperience in a non-live venue. Specifically, the first four tracks--while enjoyable--are a bit slower than expected if you've already heard later Warp Brothers material. This is disappointing, but track five onwards make up for it with driving hardcore beats.P.S. - The Warp Brothers include have even better mix CD on disc two of their 'Warp 10' double album that has hardcore beats from beginning to end."
4,Pretty good for American-made trance,"Just like the other volumes of Tranzworld before it, Tranzworld 6 offers a non-stop compilation of instrumental trance music. Most of the tracks on here lack the melodic feel of my favorite songs found on volumes 4 and 5. There's not much melody to remember them by, so you probably won't find yourself playing them over in your head. Most songs consist of a strong bass line with just a few sound effects and samples spread throughout. Also a minor complaint: For some reason the producers of the album left the staticy vinyl record sound present within most of the tracks. I suppose it gives it more of that ""club feel"", but for a digital format such as an audio CD it just seems unecessary. Ultimately, Tranzworld 6 still delivers the fast-paced electronic music the series is known for that can hold it's own when compared to European artists and compilations. If you like high bpm club/rave style music, you can't go wrong with Webster Hall's Tranzworld 6."
5,Live is better,"I always felt that there was something missing from the Townes Van Zandt studio recordings that I heard. I was never that fond of his voice, but he was obviously a great songwriter, so I always keep listening, hoping that something would click. But to me, his songs sounded better when other artists covered them. On this live recording, however, Townes and his songs really shine. I finally get it. Maybe it's the fact that more of his personality shines through in a club show setting, and also he is playing to a small audience of devotees. Whatever the case, these two discs contain some inspired performances, highlighting the warmth, humor, and tenderness of his songs."
3,Great album but it arrived new with dirty vinyl,The record is great but it arrived new with dust and fingermarks all over the vinyl. Whoever is in charge of inserting the records into the paper sleeve should be reprimanded.
5,The essential Townes Van Zandt recording,"""Townes Van Zandt is the best songwriter in the whole world and I'd stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that,"" is the often repeated quote of Steve Earle, and this is the ultimate proof. Just the legendary troubadour, his acoustic guitar and his charming wit, everybody should own this album. TvZ at his artistic peak."
1,"Disgusting, distasteful, noise not music","How can anyone listen to country music wung by a guy named ""Van Zandt"". He should be playing electronica or euro-trash"
4,The VERY BAD beginning,These kids are unlucky and with Count Olaf after their money which was left behind when their house burned down and killed their parents count olaf tries somthing horrible read it to see the outcome
4,He doesn't lie...,"At the opening of this book, the author tells you that this is NOT a happy book. And he's not kidding. I can see where this would have great appeal as a children/young adult book, and I think it is very clever.However, when I buy kids books, my wife and I are looking for something fun to read to each other in bed, and this was just a bit too depressing for me. My wife loved it (in fact, she knew the author in college at Wesleyan, which was a pretty weird coincidence... Dan -- Mo say hi! )I would recommend it to any child looking for something a bit more off the wall than Harry Potter."
1,Disappointment,"I saw this series in a local bookstore and purchased the whole set for our daughters to read on vacation. The book descriptions on the jacket were hysterical and I couldn't wait to give them to our girls.Fortunately, I was too curious to wait and read the first book myself. What a disappointment! While the jacket cover suggested great humor and funny books, it was anything but. I kept waiting and waiting for the funny parts to come, but they never did. Obviously I missed the humor that other reviewers enjoyed. All I felt after reading book one was depressed.I hate to be a party pooper, and usually, I'm the first one to enjoy silly kids books, but I returned this series of books the next day. The first book wasn't silly, even in an over-the-top way. It just missed the mark for me. I'd recommend parents read some of the books themselves before offering to their kids (especially younger kids)."
1,A book with no value,"For any parent who loves for there children to read books that cause them to come away with a feeling of hope, joy, strength, or at the least to have learned something beneficial, this book is not for you. It was dark, cruel and perverse with what I felt was sexual tendencies. As I told my 11 yr old daughter, there are absolutely thousands of good books out there to read. Don't waste your time on Lemony Snicket!"
4,The Bad Beggining,The bad begginig is about three children and there parents died in a fire and they had to move in with there closest relitive and that was a guy named count olaf and he was a very mean person and he wanted to steel the kids fortune and he treated these kids awful and wouldn't let these kids do anything but there chores so that's all they got to do.Then at the end he made one of the kids marry him and that is a brief paragraph about the book.I reccomend this book to people who like mysteries.
4,A well-written book,"I have been wanting to read this series for some time now. When I finally got my hands on a copy, I read the whole first book in one day. The text is very understandable. The author did a good job on giving definitions of some words that aren't used much. I can't wait to read more from the series."
4,A very good read,"This book was very good and I reccomend this book for everyone. I liked this book because it had a lot of cool things in it, like when count Olaf tried to marry Violet and if she doesn't say ""I do"" he will drop Sunny from the tower. It was a very good read so read it!by, slicknick08"
4,Delicious morsel,"Smooth, creamy, and luscious, though with some very sour notes! Oh crumb cake! Now I must scramble and taste the next course of course! Oh that I had not the fortunate misfortune of devouring this delicacy in a sitting! I fear this feast may be too rich and glorious for my taste! Yet my appetite is whet for what follows. Is Lemony your real name?"
5,The Bad Begging,The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket is the first of eleven books in A Series of Unfortunate Events. The Bad Beginning is a fictional book. The books don't have any awards but there was a movie made about the first three books in the series.The Baudelaire children quickly become the Baudelaire orphans when visiting the beach. Unknowingly at home their house burns down and their parents along with it. The orphans go to live with Count Olaf and he treats them like they are slaves. Count Olaf makes the oldest orphan Violet be in a play where he will secretly marry her. Will he succeed?I like this book because it is a fun book to read. This book is not worth your time if you don't like sad books. If I had to rate this book one through five I would rate it five because it is fun and adventureous book to read.
5,wonderful,I wanted to read it before the movie because usually the book is better than the movie if you have read the book. I found it to be excellent.It is so unique and different.I highly recommend it.
4,The Bad Begining,"I liked this book because it is an adventure book. Also I liked this book because it is a mystery and not only that, its a cliffhanger. There are 11 books in the series and its a journey to come.Whhat happebs in this book is that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny's parents die in a terrible fire accident. They have to live with a relative called Count Olaf. Their relative wants to take the Baudelaires fortune(the one their parents left them when they died) Violet must be 18 to access the fortune. To find out more buy this book and enjoy!"
4,"different, but good..","its true that you keep hoping for the kids to catch a break, because that's usually the way it goes, but they don't. this is an easy book to read and kids may enjoy it. my only problem with it was that it all of a sudden is over, and its really short. I could have realized that before buying it if only i'd looked at the length. but overall i enjoyed it, and i'd recommend it to pull you out of the normal storyline comfort zone."
5,Lemony Snicket is da bomb,"I really like Lemony Snicket's books, they are all consistently good. I like this one because it introduces Esme, who is the perfect satire of the modern fashionista."
4,Lemony Snicket,"This book is extremely exciting. It is a depressing book, but still good. I am 10 years old and I loved this book. At first I thought it would be very boring and long, but it turned out that it was very good. Thinking of Count Olaf sends chills down my spine."
4,The Bad Beginning,"Have your parents or family member died if so you may know how the bauldileirs feel in this. Their parents died in a fire. The fire burned down their house and most everything inside. Now they have to live with their parent's friend temporally until they find a family member for the baudileirs.A couple days later they find a family member and he calls himself count Olaf. While the kids are there they have a miserable time with him. He treats them horrid and makes them do so many chores. I would recommend this book to some one who enjoys mystery and realistic fiction.Now he has planned marry poor violet the oldest of the baudileirs. If he succeeds he will own the entire baudileirs fortune. Will any thing go wrong with the wedding? Lemony, Snicket writes many other books the bad begging is just one of many of his books. It's also a series book. Some of his others are The Basic 8 and watch Your Mouth."
4,A Not Very Nice Book,I really liked this book even though it is really sad. It is really enjoyable and very exciting. The Baudelaire children are very unfortunate children and I hope they make it.
2,BAD BEGINNING INDEED,"I was surprised, after being seduced by the book's cover, how ordinary a read this is. It claims to be like Edward Gorey, but doesn't have half the bite of his work. I found the villians to be stock characters, and I found the resolution ad-libbed. On the other hand, it's a quick, felicitous read."
1,One of the worst books I have read,"As a ten year old, I found the book was really, really boring. I enjoy reading books and have read at least 1000 books or more already. I did not enjoy this book at all. The story involves three kids, whose parents are dead, are left in the care of their uncle. The uncle is a greedy man determined to get hold of the fortune left to the children. Though the beginning had a little bit of excitement, the rest of the book did not compare. The characters do not follow what it written about them. While I do not mean to nitpick, the boy is supposed to be the well read person amongst the three siblings. However, it is the girl who reads a lot in the story and gets the three out of trouble. I would not recommend this book to others."
2,Wanted the next best thing after Harry Potter. didn't get it,"I was looking for a book that would be as fun as reading Harry Potter and I heard that these books were what I was looking for. I'm 21 and LOVE Harry Potter but not these. I felt like I should be 10 yrs younger to read this. Just wasn't entertained at all. So overall, not a book for anyone just the little ones."
1,"Roald Dahl is not alive anymore, thank you very much","Mr. Snicket has read way too many Roald Dahl Books. Unfortunately he has not zeroed in the humorous aspects to said books. The Lemony books feature children who are destined to have terrible things happen to them, with no chance of rising above their fate. It is obvious that HarperCollins has sunk a ton of money in promotion for Mr. Snicket, who apparently has no respect for his fans. Too bad. My three children hated his didactic drivel. Come one, Harpers, wise up!! Get an author who has respect for his fans. When an author shows up saying he is not the author at all but a friend, and signs his books, ""To a future orphan,"" we know the author is trying desperately to be a *star*, but not necessarily a lover of his children-fans!! If only Mr. Snicket would understand that parents are shelling out money based on their kids's suggestions..."
1,Dumbing down children again.,"Harry Potter this is not. There is nothing but a sad attempt to be original or dark in the plot. Defining the mediocre vocabulary is condescending to the reader, especially since most children over 8 years old would be familiar with the words. Even if they weren't, I think it would be a more effective learning tool if they were taught such critical reading skills as learning the meaning of the words from the context of the sentence. I really think the author spent more time thinking up marketing ploys for his books than actually spending quality time in the writing of them."
2,Don't even waste your time...,"This book is horrible, but it's title says it all. This book makes you very scared, not in a fun way. I hate the whole ""forbidden"" thing. If Leminy Stikrit, or what ever the authors name is does not want readers to read his book, why publish this series? It's one horrible thing after another, why read a book like this at these times? I had bad dreams about it, my theory is to stay happy and don't let any thing get in the way of it. This book does that. Plus it has a horrible ending, I mean at least pull it all together at the end of the book so readers finish happy. Where does this even take place? The author describes it as a dirty city, but what city? Is Lippicy Snubbit making fun of where I live? Anyway, I suggest you don't crash yourself by reading this. You will probably stay in a bad mood for a week or two."
4,A Great Book!!!,"This book was great!!! I read it and seconds later I was reading the sequel. Literally. The book was so ADDICTING!!! Violet is literally my younger brother's HERO! The Baudelaires are great people to read about. The series is great so far, and i'm on the ninth book. Keep reading and the book gets better and better."
4,From a Teacher,"This book captivated my 5th Grade students. They were very eager to read along with me and have requested the next 2 books in the series. The language development and short chapters make it a very good book to read to or with a child. As a parent, it provides a good story based on self-reliance."
4,Mixed Feelings,"It's difficult to say whether I liked or disliked this book. Mainly, on the surface, the book seems too unrealistic and ridiculous, but when looking closer, Snicket conveys true, honest feelings and really loves his characters. He often goes on for a few pages, expressing thoughtful, deep thoughts, that I truly appreciated. It's funny...at times I find myself thinking that the books are a little too far fetched...but cant find myself putting the books down! The books appeal is how different it is. Snickets writing is so original, it is difficult to know what he is thinking most of the time. What can I say? The books are so unique...they're addicting!"
4,Strong Determined Kids,"Lemony Snicket has created another great book. I enjoyed this imaginative creation of A Series Of Unfortunate Events.In this version, Count Olaf is a famous auctioneer in disguise and the Baudelaire children are living with a selfish, greedy woman and a weak husband that avoids arguments as much as possible. These children have to go up countless flights of steps, climb up and down a dark elevator shaft many times, get lost in a huge penthouse, and put up with Count Olaf evil terror again. All this did not deter them from trying to save themselves and their friends.There is a great mystery brewing, and it makes you want to read more to find out the entire truth behind the Baudelaire mansion, Count Olaf, and V.F.D. I do recommend the 6th book of the series. Thanks.Joy."
4,The Bad Begining...,"The Bauldelare millionare's soon became the Bauldelaire orphans. Sunny Klause and Violet's mother and father die in a terrible house fire burning down the entire Bauldelaire mansion. This horrible event forced Violet Klause and Sunny to live with a very distant relative, Count Olaf. Olaf forces the children to do boring chores all day, so he can come up with a plan to capture the entire Bauldelaire fortune. He temps the children to spend money on things like better liveing quarters seeing as he only gives them one bed to share amoungst the three. Everywhere the children look they see these eyeballs...I won't give a away the rest so read it yourself because this is a great book and you won't be able to put it down."
4,The Bad Beginning,"This is a wonderful, scary, intriguing story. It is a book that you cannot put down. It starts with a bad beginning and an even worse end. Trust me, by the end of the book you may not have any fingernails left because u will be gnawing away on them.It starts with the three Baudelaire children. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Violet had a knack for inventing. Klaus was the intelligent one. And Sunny liked to bite. They get caught in an awful disaster. They have to stay with an evil relative and work and help him. In the story they learn how to cook, clean, drive, and live in horrible conditions. They learn that they can never be to prepared.To me this story was very well written. I love books where I can't put them down. I would recommend this book for anyone 11 and up who loves wonderful, scary, and intriguing stories.-Hottie"
5,"AWESOME, MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!","The Bad Beginning is the best book I have read in a long time! The Baudelaire Children's lives are filled with very unfortunate events and unforgettable characters. The book is very humorous in a strange, dark kind of way. I bought the first one and couldn't stop! Now, 2 days later I am on the third! This is a really GREAT book! I know that if you start to read it, you will not be able to put it down!!!!!!!!!TRY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
3,The Good Book,The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket is a realistic fiction story with weird characters that keep you reading until the end of the book. In the book there are three children who lose both their parents in a fire that burned their mansion. So they live with a mean relative named Count Olaf.Cout Olaftreas them badly and yet wants something from them. The book is written so young children can easily understand it.Had my father not sent me to bed I would have finished it in one sitting. The book brought alot of sad thoughts in my head and yet I found it quite interesting.
4,GREAT READ!,I read this in about 3 and a half hours! It was really good and a pretty quick read. I think people who like Harry Potter will enjoy it! The Bad Beginning also improved my vocabulary!
5,This was a great book! One of the best!,"The best part about this book was the change in plot. All the earlier ones were ""Count Olaf disguises himself. The guardian doesn't beleive them. Mr. Poe doesn't help, but in the end they pull of Count Olaf's disguise but he runs away."" But this includes helping the Quagmire Triplets, Esme Squalor, a mystery about the tunnel leading to the ashes of the Baudelaire Mansion, and the increasing Mystery of V.F.D. This book also has some very funny humor, exiting action, and a thrilling mystery of betrayal, freindship and hope."
3,I'm on to better stories.,"This is the last Snicket book I'm reading. I guess I'm tired of endless misery or else I'm outgrowing this kind of book. If your parents will let you read young adult books which mine we'll, you should try Holes by Louis Sachar or Sights by Susanna Vance or books by Gary Paulsen. These books show you REAL hard times, but the kids work they're way out of them. Big difference! A lot more fun and exciting. (All these writers have library awards, in case your parents want to know.)"
4,It's not that great...,"But the rest of Lemony's books are awesome. The little amount that it takes to read this book it is worth it. You have to read it to uderstand the rest in the series, which I give all of them 5 stars!"
2,I dislike it,I did not like it. I say a haouse called awful end is better. This book did not have a moral i found it to be life sucks but what can you do?I dont reccomed this book to kids the only reason I read it is 'cuse my cursh was reading it you know how that works. I treied to use it for him to like me but after the first two books I felt like trowing them out the window.
2,not that great but i guess........,"Hello.I am a vivid reader and when my dad and his girlfriend bought me the series of unfortunate events #1 thru #6, I was not exeption-ally pleased.I read them all, so when I had to do a book review for school I picked the bad beginning.I really liked the story line-three sibling's parents die when the house is caught on fire and burnt to the ground and then they go live with the horrendous Count Olaf-but at cirtain points the story really seemed to be getting nowhere.Also, when Lemony Snicket wries things like the first sentence of the book, (from my perception) it seems to discorage me.(""oops"" if I have spelling mistakes)"
3,"Slight and fun, but don't expect Harry Potter","While sometimes awfully clever, don't expect from this slim volume either the giddy imagination or the emotional pull of the Harry Potter books. There is something sillier going on here, something more cartoonish. As an adult reader, I find the Potter books fulfilling in the way that ""Star Wars"" or Greek mythology is fulfilling; they nourish the soul at the same time that they entertain. (Pretentious as that may sound, I think it's true.) ""The Bad Beginning"" (and presumably the rest of the books in the series) is very much a story for children, albeit one that teaches the valuable lesson that life is not always a bed of roses."
1,What is this telling our kids?,"I am a writer and I can tell you that this series is not a good one for kids. Kids need to be taught that through hard work and dedication, happy endings are usually to follow. I don't understand what this series of childrens books is wanting to teach. Books are meant to teach lessons, such as life lessons and morals. This series of childrens books teaches that no matter how hard you try, you will always fail."
3,Review: The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events Book 1),"This book was exactly what I was hoping for to start the series! I bought it for a grandchild who started reading early and think it will be a new favorite. The concept of a child (or family of children) resolving issues and making sense of the uncomfortable events they encounter is empowering. The first vendor sent me a book that was in terrible condition but refunded my money and I bought a copy at the local Barnes and Nobel. The other book I bought from another Amazon vendor, the fourth, in the series was great."
3,OKAY,"The Series of Unfortuanate Events is a really good series, but ever since the Quamire triplets came into the picture I think they in a way ruined everthing. Maybe Lemony Snicket didn't know where the series was going and added those characters so he could have more to write about, but they didn't help at all. I'm currently reading the 8th book and I'm pretty relieved that the Quagmires aren't the main subject anymore.In the Ersazt Elevator the Baudelaires get to go to a new home after their friends, the Quagmires are kidnapped. Then the story really is all about the Quagmires and it just gets borring."
5,You'll be unfortunate if you don't read this book!,Only Lemony Snicket could of wrote this book. If you read the first page you just can't stap reading it. Also if you read THE BAD BEGINNING you have to read the rest of the series. Lemony Snicket is BY FAR the best author the world has ever seen.
4,Reversal of Fortune?,"Am I trying too hard, or is there some connection between Klaus and Sunny and the Von Bulows? Now, if I could just figure out how Violet fits in..."
4,"Definetly not your standard cheerful and innocent children's book, but still good","While much, much darker than probably anything your child has read, the Series of Unfortunate Events is still a good read for younger readers(ages 8-12) provided they are mature enough to handle some of the darker aspects of the book. There's nothing too innapropriate in the books that would make them unsuitable for children to read, but its still a much more mature read than your child might be used to, and may give them an unpleasant glimpse into the harsh realities of the real world."
3,Not suspenseful enough for me. (Some spoilers!),"I bought all 13 books already with my own money, so i intend to finish the series, but it's hard when these books are sometimes not interesting enough. This book has some suspense like V.F.D. and the Ersatz elevator shaft leading to the remains of the Baudelaire mansion, but it seems that it was not as suspenseful as the 5th book for some reason. I think that these books will become more suspenseful and interesting as the series continues, but right now it is just not to that point. I think this series is good so far, but the plot is overly repeated, so as that the reader and almost guess to what is exactly going to happen. I think/know that the Harry Potter series is better then this series. You should read that series if you want a real good read with a lot of suspense, interest, and magic.Thank you for your time,Loran"
5,An excellent book,Lemony snicket did a great job writing this book with lots of action and unfortunate events. A great book for kids
5,screech,"If you don't like sad stories don't read this story.It isn't sad it's just kind of wierd.This book is sad and very unfortunate.A lot of bad things happen to the Baudelaires.One thing that is,oops I can't tell you.The author writes these stories because maybe bad things happened to him when he was a kid.This book was as good as chocolate, and i really love chocolate."
4,Not a bad beginning,"The Bad BeginningWhen I read this book I loved it. And I normally don't read books but I read this one. It was such a good book. I could not put this book down; it's packed with adventure and thrilling suspense. A book this size I normally read in about a week, but this book I read in 2 days. If it was time to put this book down and do something else. I would keep on reading for about 10 more minutes. Like I said this book was hard to put down. If I came upon something that I was curious about earlier in the story, it would answer my question that I had asked myself way back in the book. But I definitely recommend this book to anyone because you will definitely like it. Trust me if you get this book at your library or buy it at a bookstore the money you spent on this book will be well worth it."
2,Children only,"I was drawn to this book by some great reviews that suggested that it might be an amusing read for an adult like Harry Potter, or the Narnia books. It is not. It may be fine for a young child but otherwise it has no interest. It can be read by an adult in an hour or two, has little plot, no well defined characters or locations. It even explains words to you as if you were seven years old. It does have an element of black humour that will amuse some children. Buy it for a child as an easy read to encourage them to pick up a book rather than a video game but otherwise look elsewhere for good children's literature."
5,A Hopeful Review?,"The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket is a very influential book and has had an impact on my life. It was one of the first books I was reading while I was maturing as a reader.The book shows that life isn't always fair, but also that perseverance and never giving up is important and things may work out in the end. Things won't happen if you don't take the initiative. It also depicts that there are people with good and bad intentions within the world. There is a potential within us to do good or bad, the decision is left up to us and we must live with whatever happens, the consequences. The author's style revolves around the use of formal language as well as explaining words and phrases that adds to understanding and the mood of the story. Figurative language such as similes, metaphors, and clichés are also exercised in the book.The book is aimed at a young audience. I would highly recommend this gem of a novel."
4,A Miserably Good Read,"This series is finally getting some much deserved recognition (a spot on CBS' Sunday Morning sure can't hurt sales). And while some may wonder if Lemony and his creations are doomed to the perils of hype, I for one probably wouldn't have bothered reading this first book if it were not for the hype. I must say I found ""The Bad Beginning"" to be enjoyable in a most delectibly wicked way. This is not the Great American Novel, nor is it even Harry Potter, but then it was not intended to be either. Shades of Roald Dahl come to mind, but not to the point where this seems like pure imitation. It is indeed pure inspiration and I delight in the fact that children can peruse these sophisticated tales of morbid melodrama."
5,a thriller for all ages,"if you would like an unfortunate, funny, and definently thrilling book this is the book for you. a great book for everyone. so pick up this book today."
3,A bad life,"I am reading the series The series of unfortunate events. I am reading the book The Bad Beginning. This is a good book for children because it shows what some children's lives are really like and it shows that life isn't always good. I am telling the truth when I say this but, this is a really depressing book. If you like depressing or sad books than this is the book for you.I don't like depressing books but when I picked up this book I couldn't stop reading it, that is how good it really is. My favorite part is when the Baudelaure orphans first meet Justice Strauss. I also like when they go into her library and Sunny says OOO-GASH-BAH. Justice Strauss laughs at the comment, that is my favorite part of this book because they are happy and NOT sad yet. One reason I hate this book is because Count Olaf abuses the children and basically uses Sunny."
3,Bad Begining,"This book was about the three Budulaire children. They had a good life and one day they went home and they found their parents murdered. So one day they had to stay with a guy named Count Olf. He was not a good fosture parent. He didn't have a nice house. And the three Budularie children did not have a good place to sleep. They only had one bed, one messed up matrees, and a box to put their clothes in. Count Olf made the Budulaire children do chours all day and they had to fix dinner every night for Count Olf. Count Olf would go somewhere with his friends.I would recomend this book because it has a lot of drama.To learn more go to target or your local library to read it."
5,This is a wonderful and entertaining book.,"This book is adventorous and full of woesome events.You will never want to put it down.It will pull you in so that you feel like you are actually there.This book will make you cry,laugh,and realize how lucky you really are.This book is great for both boy and girl,adult and child.I love this book and I think you'll like it to."
4,There's something wrong with this one...,"okay, I started reading the series in 4th grade and when I got up to this one, I stopped......just stopped.....then I came back and read it in 6th grade i belive...so, something is wrong with this one,I don't know what but it just put a stop to my attention.so anyway, the book itself.It's not my favorite,which means something, because when I look at all the books I have a hard time chosing my favorite, they're all good! But this one's not the best,no no no, its not, its GOOD,but its not as good as the others.so, when you reach this book when reading the series, expect a little less."
5,Bookabyenee,"I like this book because it is so mysterious. I think other kids should read it because it makes you never want to stop reading it.I read the other books too.I think Lemony Snicket is very talented.I`m looking forward to another book.I hope other kids read these books, too."
5,Funnily Horrible.,"A book where nothing ever comes out right. Horrible, you must think! Well, er, yes. The Series of Unfortunate Events is just that, but it's part of the appeal. These books are amusing horror stories geared toward children in elementary and middle school, and though at times terrible, they still manage to sustain a queer quality that attracts readers."
4,"Very Good, But A Little Annoying","Although this is an excelent book, with a good plot and belivable charachters, I almost put the book down when I saw the description on the back. I mean come on! Lenomy Sniket made me feel that people that like happy endings wouldn't like this book. I am one of those poeple, but I LOVED it! A must read for Harry Potter fans, and everyone else."
3,A decent book.,"A decent 6th novel in the Series of Unfortunate Events. The plots become more outlandish as the series continues, but I suppose they would have to as few obvious ideas remain for putting the Beaudelaires in such dire straits. I enjoy the fact that a mystery is being revealed along the way that will hopefully be concluded at the end of the series. If the books were just the unfortunate events themselves, I may have quit reading some time ago."
1,A Grand Disappointment,"Rarely was a book so aptly named: This one is indeed a Bad Beginning to a series. It's clear that writers like JK Rowlings (of Harry Potter fame), Patricia Wrede (the Dealing with Dragons series) and EL Konigsberg (oh so many wonderful books) -- to name just a few, like and respect their readers, even the young ones. Lemony Snicket, in contrast, is snide and condescending. I can't imagine reading any of the other books this author is pumping out. Two thumbs down!"
2,Bad stuff happens...,"I tried to get into the spirit of this book--yes, bad stuff happens, that's the deal, but it may be fun to read. Well, for me, it wasn't much fun. The kids' parents are killed off, they're then put in the guardianship of some beaureaucrat who doesn't care about their welfare, they get placed with a horrible distant relative who is mistreating them and plotting against them--in no very interesting way. I guess I just don't get it. It was just a series of ugly events about characters that are only marginally interesting in a setting even less marginally interesting. I'm giving the two stars because I like the book cover image and the title and author's name (all those made the books seem very promising), and the kids tried to be somewhat resourceful, but that was it."
3,The Bad Beginning,"My review for The Bad Beginning is that it was a book for people who like a mystery and enjoy reading about people that have alot of troubles in their live. Thre kids, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, have many things go wrong throughout their lives. I the beginning of the book, the kids' parents are killed by a fire in their home. Their house is gonte. The parents left a big fortune for Violet when she comes of age. Count Olaf, a distant uncle, tries to steal the fortune. He is not able to. I would recommend this book to my brother, or someone who thinks it is cool that a kid has many problems in their life. I am not that kind of person, so this book is not one of my favorites."
1,Now THAT was a bad book!,"When i heard my entire grade ranting about how fabulously amazing it was, i decided to read it. it sucked. i was expecting a phenomoneal book full of emotion and sacrifice. instead, you might as well have made a list of bad things that could happen, and publish it in a best selling book. Snicket did what anyone else could have, think of bad things. over all, i would NEVER suggest this book to anyone else."
2,My kids are not pleased.,"Always on the quest to find books that will please my 8 and 9 year olds, I tried Lemony Snicket. The novel starts with the sudden death of the parents of the three Baudelaire children and the gutting of their home by fire. Things go downhill for them from there.The book is heavily ironic and affected. It keeps an ""isn't this clever"" barrier between itself and the reader. My kids snickered once or twice but they were obviously not drawn in by the plight of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans.One gimmick Mr. Snicket uses is to define some words within the narration. Surprisingly, this was what my kids liked the best, particularly when the explanations were for the utterances of the baby.With Harry Potter and Holes, my kids begged me each night to read just one more chapter and failing that just one more word. Not so with Lemony Snicket. We won't be reading Book 2."
1,Parents don't waste your money on this one!,"As a teacher, I have read this for a book group run in my district. Normally I look forward to reading these books. I was frankly disgusted from beginning to end. From the moment the parents burn to death in their house, to the irritatingly intrusive explanations of words, I was completely turned off. I was further disturbed to see the sexual overtones of the cousin, assigned to raise the children, devise a plan to marry the oldest girl (still a young teen) for their fortune. When the plan is foiled the cousin steals the youngest and threatens to drop her from a great height! I looked on [online store] to find out why kids liked it and was completely confounded by the amount of adults who thought this book clever! I hope parents read this review. It has too many mature themes for 4th graders and is too young for teens. I can't see in what age group this fits. I have an open mind when it comes to books, but I implore you to choose something else to read!"
3,Nothing special,"I have to admit that this book will keep you interested in the story and you will laugh two or three times, but it also have to many things that are pathetic, like Sunny going up in the elevator space.At first you will be happy reading the book and all the things that happened to this three kids, but the end of the book is one of the worst ends I ever read, that doesn't mean that you can't have a good time reading this book, that means that LS must think other ways to finish their books, because when you read a regular book and the end is bad, the book is also bad."
2,Short....but pointless,I picked this book up to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out. I was rather disappointed. It seems the story line and development are crafted to fit childrens reading but the vocabulary and patience required to read this book to the end is tartgeted at adults. I'm sure there could be a good balance but this author does not acheive it. I was bored with this book.
5,Bad Beginning Book Review,"I thought the Bad Beginning was a great book. I got the book from a book order. I did not read it in class when we had to read until one day, I didn't have any books to read. Then I remembered I had the book in my backpack. I started reading it and reading it and I thought it was good. Throughout the book, every chapter got better. When we would have to stop reading. I would wonder what would happen next. The book starts out with three Baudelaire children who become orphans. I will not tell how they become orphans, because you would have to read it and find out, so I will not ruin the story. I would give the book 5 stars. I think kids who lost their parents should read this book."
5,the bad beggining by josh wise,"this book is great! although i feel bad saying that because its about three kids whose lives are absolutely awful in pretty much every way! After receiving news of their parents utterly awful (and more to the point unexplainable) demise while playing peacefully on the beach! Violet, sunny & klaus baudelaire are sent (by the ever-coughing mr poe!) to their new guardian(and their FIRST as their are many more books to come!) the ever-evil count olaf! Who attemps to steal the baudelaire fortune. I really enjoyed it! it is funnier (as it is a children's book) than it has any right to be! i particularly recommend this one to kids around 9-14 for it's simplicity of style!"
5,Teaching with Bad Beginnings,"I taught Bad Beginnings to a 6th grade class last year. They become completely addicted, and we ended up reading the entire series throughout the course of the year. Not only is the series fast-paced and written to be a ""cliff-hanger"", from a teacher's standpoint, it is an excellent way to introduce new vocabulary in a painless manner. The books also provide an excellent source of discussion about character traits, and literary ""tricks"", like the way L. Snicket uses descriptive words as place names. All in all, I would highly recommend this book, as well as the others in the series."
3,Is it really for 10+?,"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't quite the dark adventure I was hoping for, but I like the way it introduces vocabulary and idioms, with a definition. However, this did change the character of the book for me, making me feel like it was more appropriate for younger readers. I'm going to read the next few books and consider enjoying it with my class.The Baudelaire children are very bright, but tragedy takes their parents, home, and possessions from them. They are sent across town to live with Count Olaf, a very distant relative who wants nothing more than to have the children's fortune. Nothing of measurable happens to these children, who go through terrible trials and, in the end, have a happy ending snatched from them."
5,Sad but Amazing,This book was very sad but had good feelings to it. I could almost feel I was there. 2nd book!
4,Good book,Amazing and sad book do not read if you don't like sad books other than sad it is a really good book
5,Ersatz Elevator Exceptionally Enjoyable,"Ersatz Elevator is another in the Series of Unfortunate Events series. As with the previous stories, it does not disappoint. I love reading about the Baudelaires and their ability to overcome adversity.I will continue to read the series even though warned that the situations are often dire and could upset my stomach.Signed,An avid but anonymous reader"
4,Count Olaf Appears!,"When I first got this book, the Baudilaires looked like a family to me. Young adult mum, with a husband and a new baby. In fact, the three of them are orphan children. There is Violet, who is fourteen and a talented inventor. Then there is twelve-year old Klaus, more of a researcher and source of info. Last there is Sunny, who is still a baby and likes to bite things. BITE was her first word!When they are on the beach one day, they are informed of a fire that killed their parents. A distant relative named Count Olaf gets custody of them and the adversity really begins for them...It's a decent book but it isn't really one I'd recommend to people. The later books are better."
4,Life isn't always happily ever after,"This book is so gloomy and pessimistic that it's absurd. Seriously, though, I think it's a good introduction to children of the concept that not all stories have happy endings. In real life, optimism is not always warranted. This is a fact that some of our political leaders today would do well to learn."
4,The Bad Begining,"Three children named Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. There parents were killed in a mysterios fire. They were sent to a great friend of thier parents, Mr. Poe. He is in control of all of the childrens affairs. For a while they were with Mr. Poe but then they were sent to Count Olaf,thier very distant relative. Count Olaf was treated the children very badly. He gave them tons of chores. They had poor living conditions. Read the book to see how the children try to get out of Count Olafs care."
4,"Money, Money, Money is the root of all evil. (...)","The best book you'll ever read is The Series of Unfortunate Events, The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket. Three orphans and an evil man go through many twists and turns. I think many people should read The Bad Beginning. It has excruciating details. You wouldn't believe how interesting it is.In the beginning the three orphans' parents perish in a fire. Then they go to a terrible man's house who makes them do horrible things. Count Olaf doesn't treat them nicely. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so mean.In the middle the teribble, Count Olaf wants the orphans fortune. So he tries to put on a play that involves marrying one of the orphans. Then he would get the fortune. Read to find out who keeps the fortune."
5,Shiver up your...eye,"When the Baudelaire Orphans, Violet, Claus, and Sunny are recently informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, the search for a new (safe and the opposite of hostile) guardian begins. However, Count Olaf [the siblings' supposedly closest member to their parents] is exactly the opposite. With a mischevious tatoo of an eye on his left ankle, this greedy and unsympathetic infamous actor plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents. The main ingredients of this takeover being a next-door-justice, acting crew (package includes two white powdered face women, a hookhanded man, a bald person who looks like neither or man or woman, and loads of other vile creatures), and hostility. Quite the intruiging read. I suggest this book to anyone who likes adventure and creepy, tall, thin men with only one eyebrow and a tatoo of an eye on his left ankle."
4,Not for Fairy Tale Lovers!,"In this book there are three main characters, Violet Baudelaire, who loves to invent, Klaus Baudelaire, who is very smart for he reads a lot of books, and Sunny Baudelaire, a little bit larger than a boot, who loves to bite with her four razer sharp teeth. In the beginning, Mr. Poe, an old family friend, comes down to tell them that their parents perished in a terrible fire. They get sent to live with a family member whom they've never heard of, Count Olaf. Is he good or evil? Read the book and find out! I liked this book for its crazy vocabulary and the tension of thinking, ""Will they get out of this tight spot?"" like the Harry Potter series."
5,A Bad Beginning But A Great Book,This book is one of the best books that I have ever read. I loved it! It is very interesting. You never know what Lemony Snickett will do. Anything can happen in his books. Two thumbs up!
4,A Bad Beginning,"Most books start with a happy beginning.That is how it started with this book.For about a few pages it was a happy beginning.Then the sky got dark and that,in my opinion, was the start of Lemony Snicket's book. It is hard to say what age is appropriate for this book. Under the age of eight will probably get a little scary.But I wouldn't be surprised if a adult got spooked by this ghastly tale. There are eight more books in this series and you can go to [the website]"
5,VFW LIVES,"Still one of the darkest and best books of the series, this multivoice/sound effect recording was definitely the way to go for entertainment value! Too bad none of the other 12 audio-books in the series offered this option. I stuck it out to the end for all the audio books and mostly enjoyed them. I would've liked my Lemony Snickets a little meaner and darker but brooding adults probably weren't the target audience LOL! The best part of all the audio books is that each has it's own music track performed by The Gothic Archies, I purchased the additional Series of Unfortunate Events audio CD and can't rave enough about it!"
4,"if you don't like this, give the others a chance","I have read all the books and although they are children's book, (I started reading them b/c of my younger sister,)they are funny and I like Snicket's voice. They are an easy read but I would have to say it truley is a ""bad beginning,"" the others later in the series are much better. I did not like Olaf's relationship with Violet in this one either. See the movie, the costumes are great."
2,"I like the illustrations, but not the story","This book was compared to the Harry Potter books in a famous entertainment magazine and I decided to purchase it since I loved the Harry Potter books. I am not sure if the targetted age group for this book is the same as H.P., but it feels much more juvenile. The author keeps interrupting the story to define words, which is highly annoying. Also the characters are not very well developed and everything is very predictable. It does not live up to the hype. Check it out in a library before you spend your money on it."
4,"Paramount (here meaning ""superior"") story...","Don't be misled by reviewers who insist on either comparing this series to Harry Potter or dismissing it as ""too scary"" or politically incorrect for children. Adult readers who find the author's periodic definitions of big words annoying or insulting are forgetting that they're not the target audience. The premise here--that bad things keep happening to good children--is dealt with fairly tongue-in-cheek, and though it would seem that there's no one in the world to save the Baudelaire children from their presumed fate, it's they themselves who will come to their own rescue (and they do)! Funny, witty, and charmingly different from much of what's being published for kids now."
3,the book,"This book is good but i think that the author could get to the pooint quicker. He can bable on and on for about 2 pages on the differance between the word anxciose and nervouse. In the begining of each chapter he writes what he is thinking even if it has nothing to do with the book. Otherwise this book is good. If you like adventure and mystery books this is a good choice. Its about 250 pages long, so i would recomend it for a 4-6th grader."
4,Good Children's book,"Reading this book as an adult...it wasn't that great at all, especially the ending was very disappointing.Reading this book if I were in elementary school, I would have loved it. So I gave the 4 stars for the children reading this book as that is who it is intended for."
3,"A Good Start, but got kind of depressing...","It had a good start and was interesting enough: An anonomyus author who warns you that the book is depressing and not very good which is funny actually. The thing is is i'm actually applauding the author for his ironic zest and i did not like the books just as he said. Despite a habitual warning every book the readers persisted until the end where they were utterly disapointed. It was almost as if to say ""nanana na na boo boo!"" to all the readers who did not heed his solicitations. It made me laugh so thats why I gave it 3 stars. Interesting style but just too depressing!"
4,Disaster!!!,"Who's vicious, nasty, greedy, and can take poor children's lives and crush them beneath his fingers? That would be the repulsive Count Olaf. In the book A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket all Violet, Clause, and Sunny can think about is how their lives were before a fire changed their lives. Now they must live with Count Olaf, a man who has an eye watching them every second. He will do anything to get his hands on the forbidden fortune which the children's parents left behind for the kids only even if it means getting married to Violet and making the other children work in order to stay. Knowing all this there's only one thing to do either Violet gets married to the conniving Count Olaf or they run for their lives. Will they get through it or will they live a life of misery and agony. To find out read A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket."
4,The Bad Beginning,"I think the 1 Series of Unfortunate events is a good book. The main charaters are Violet the inventor, Klaus the researcher, and Sunny the biter. Theproblem they face is a man trying to steal their parents fortune. Their life is miserable being chased by the man from place to place. One of my faviorate quotes from the book is I warwed you to put this book downbecause then the story starts to get exicting. The plot is that the children are trying to get away from Olaf. The treme is mistey and action. This book is part of a series.This book is for preteens. The author is Lemony Snicket. He is very detailed in his writing This book is like Cinderalla because the children are trapped. He sometimes he does flash fowards."
5,Too delicious!,"I came to this series as a result of an interview with the author that I read in Publishers Weekly. Intrigued, I ordered the first three books. I loved them. They are purportedly children's books but the author has a wicked sense of humor, and includes references that only adults would recognize. (For example, two of the three children are named Sunny and Klaus. Gee, that makes me think about some real-life wicked goings-on.)Aside from everything else, these children actually come alive; they're inventive, clever and resourceful. They also suffer at the hands of their wonderfully conceived evil uncle Count Olaf.I've passed these books along to a number of children who gobbled them up as avidly as I did--which proves that a good book knows no age barriers. This series is pure pleasure."
5,IT'S EVERYTHING THEY SAY IT IS AND MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I recommend this for kids ages 10-15.It was really sad. I have read many of the books in this series and I have to tell you that if you don't read it in order, then you won't understand what's going on. By the way, I recommend the Harry Potter books, too."
3,From a teacher's perspective,"I decided to order the first book in this series because of the ""kid craze"" surrounding the series. Any book that engages and excites students this much is a book I have to read to see what all the fuss is about. These books are relatively easy reads with plots that are not too complicated. I can see why they would be so entertaining to kids due to their spooky nature and zany characters. Hidden within the text are great moral lessons and wonderful vocabulary. The author engages the reader by including them and directly speaking to us upon occasion. These books do not talk down to the reader and will excite students to see what happens in the following books. I will be including this series in my classroom library alongside great quality reads such as Newberry Award winners and Honors books."
1,Huh?,I really don't understand why people say this is a depressing book. The only thing depressing is that I wasted a couple hours reading it. The characters are shallow and the author is insulting by defining small words. Plotline? What plotline? And how am I supposed to care enough about these 1-dimensional characters to actually feel bad for them? Blah. And please don't insult J. K. Rowling by even mentioning Harry Potter in the same paragraph.
1,"Absolutely terrible, never seen a truer title","The book is terrible. It is boring and predictable, and seems like something someone with no writing skills would write for a middle school project. I read it in thirty minutes, and was thoroughly disappointed. I cannot believe that anyone would ever compare these books to the Harry Potter series. Defining words in every other sentence is annoying and does not help a young readers context reading skills."
5,The First of a Saga of Hilarious Events,"Though the mood of the books is dark and dreary, Snicket's witty, clever style brings light upon the subject. While the sett and cast of characters seem unreal at times, it just adds to the laugh-out-loud air of the book and it successors in the series. In this tale, orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to live with their cruel uncle who is after their fortune and attempts to get it by marring the preteen Violet. Snicket will keep you laughing until you get your hands on the next book in the series...an excellent book!"
3,Comedy and Horror,"Just like Lemony Snicket says, ""If you don't like books with unhappy endings, you might as well put this book down."" I gave this book three stars because it was a little too unhappy. I enjoyed it because it had a mix of a little comedy and horror. I liked Sunny because of all the strange things she said. I think the hooked handed man was mostly mean to just Sunny and Violet. Lemony Snicket is a harsh writer, but I enjoy his ability. I please ask you to read this book because it is very interesting."
5,weird words,"One of the best books i've read in a long time! When I read it,I learned a lot of weird words with lots of weird meanings.I especially liked when Sunny Baudelaire yells words no one can understand."
5,I LOVE these books!,"The first on the series, this book is a fantastic read. I love it. It is very good for young reader because it teaches vocabulary and is a fun story."
4,Don't Let This book Fly Out of Your Hands!,"The Bad Beginning by Lemony SnicketHave you ever thought about being slashed by your own father? If you have (which I hope you haven't) you should read The Bad Beginning. This book is about three children, Klaus, Violet, and Sunny Baudelaire whose parents died in a terrible fire (and they have to live with evil Count Olaf who's trying to steal the Baudelaire fortune.)I liked this book because I could never tell what was coming up. I thought the eye on Olaf's ankle was creepy. I also liked this book because of Sunny and all her fake words like ""Wippo!''I think the author was trying to tell children about effort. The example was the children never gave up on trying to get out Olaf's clutches. I hope this book is for you!"
2,Not That Great,"For all you other reviewers raving about how great this book is, did we read the same book? I am 14 and my sister is 8 and we both tried to get through this book. I did after forcing myself to since I had bought it. I didn't really like it at all. The story is passable, but the ending is stupid. I don't want to say too much about it for fear of giving it away in case you actually want to read this book, but its a pretty bad ending. Its the kind of ending somebody would write when they are totally out of ideas. I do not recommend this book, but other people obviously liked it. So instead of buying it, I suggest finding it at a library."
5,Great!,"This time the Baudelaire orphans are living at the street of Dark Avenue. They live with Esme and Jerome Squalor. The Baudelaires must figure out who they can trust before it is to late. Lemony Snicket does an AMAZING job with this book and it is probably the best in the series. You will definetly want to know what happens in this book if you liked the others, and you want to know what happens to the Baudelaires good friends, the Quagmires. Like I said, this book is great and you should read it!"
5,Sad but a great read.,"Enjoyed the story, humor, and the great read. look forward to the next book. Loved the characters and their counterparts."
4,Hooks Young Minds,"As a teacher, I have watched as my students have delved into the lives of the Baudelaire children, reading book after book and then ultimately asking me to read them as well. I love the obvious context clues for vocabulary and the way the book attaches to characters to their reader. I look forward to reading the rest of the books and adding them to my book corner!"
4,Review of book one of debris of unfortunate events.,"Overall a very good book. If you are just starting to read fiction like this, then this is a great place to start. However, if you are an experienced reader, all of these books are a great read and a good stress-reliever."
1,"Too depressing for kids, too condescending for adults","This series was recommended as a suitable way to stave off boredum while waiting for Book 5 of Harry Potter to come out. Terrible recommendation. It is condescending to both adults and children - defining words in the text (although often just with more difficult words than the original.)Plus, it's just depressing - admittedly, they warn you with the title - but it was depressing to me not because of what happens, but because the children are protrayed as being stupid in many ways. Kids aren't dumb. You don't, for example, not tell an adult that you trust that someone has kidnapped your little sister - it's a terrible example to set for your kids.Anyway, don't bother it isn't Harry Potter (although at least they aren't 1000 pages long...)"
5,a book with unfortunate things in it,"This is a good book to read even though there is sad parts and barely any happy parts in it. It keeps you interested through the whole book. It is one of the best books I have ever read,it is so much better then the movie. I can't wait to read the next book."
5,The Saddest Event Ever to Happen,"This book was read to me by my 4th grade teacher. Now I'm in the 6th grade and still reading the series. Lemony Snicket didn't fool me with his reverse psychology. I'm glad I didn't beacause I would have missed out on a lot. I don't know why I like this book, but if you like sad stories then this is the book for you."
5,The Bad Beginning,"The best book I have ever read! A horrible Villian named Count Olaf who the Baudelaire's are forced to live with!Scary, Exciting, and Unfortunate all in one!A must read! 5 stars!!!!-Danielle Daley"
2,Disturbing,"Well, here's another installment from the ""doesn't matter what's in it, as long as it gets kids to read!"" club. The abuse in the book and suggestive nature of Count Olaf's plan for Violet are very disturbing. And it's another ""adults are either nasty or bumbling and confused, while kids are sharp as tacks"" theme, which is getting so common in kids' books and television (especially Disney). Sigh."
1,Disturbing and Inappropriate,"I find it inconceivable that people will slam Harry Potter for its lack of Christian values, but recommend the Lemony Snickett series. That anyone could enjoy a book whose sole plot is a sick old man trying to marry his 14-year-old niece to get her fortune is disturbing to me. The strange warning to the hook man that Violet is ""his"" and a reference to the ""wedding night"" are beyond disgusting. The poor writing, demeaning definitions and lack of any real literary value add up to a cheap piece of trash..."
1,Sick and twisted. No youth (or adult) should read it.,Things like a guardian trying to force a 14 year old girl to marry and tying up an infant and hanging her in a cage 30 feet in the air are REVOLTING. Why would anyone think this is appropriate reading material for teens or children?
1,"Wow, what a bad book!","This is proboably the worst book I've ever read. It seems that most of it was written by an eight year old, or even younger then that. Sometimes it seems like it's some sort of kids TV show. The writing is highly unprofessional, especially when the author keeps saying things simular to, "" The rest of this story is so very sad. Do not read past this page."" Also, the clulessness of the kids' older friend (forgot his name) drives you crazy!And as for the ending, wow. It's like an ending to any old cartoon, tricky, but not any good. This whole book can be made into a 30 minute cartoon."
5,Great book!,This book is the first to a great series. If you like reading about three very talented siblings trying to escape an evil villain than I recommend this book. Count Olaf is the evil villain and he is trying to steal the huge Baudelaire fortune from them. Read this!!!!
4,Book Review,"I had a very enjoyable time reading this book. It pulls you in so you could not put it down. My favorite part of all the books in this series is one thing. In each book at the beginning, it warns you there is not a happy ending so put it down. This makes you so curious about what is going to happen, you have to keep reading. You just cannot resist the story. The characters are so detailed and each one is exciting. It is very descriptive, so you can see every picture. I think young adults probably 10 and older should read this book. I would recommend it to someone who likes to think and is very curious. They should read this because its so intriguing you cannot put it down, and because it is so informative about what happens and you feel like you are there!"
5,Delightful Series of Unfortunate Events,"My younger son, now almost 10, and I discovered this series of books about a year ago. We gobbled up every word in every book and couldn't get enough! The sharp whit and dark humour in these books is refreshing and appropriate for all ages (including adults!). The eleventh book, ""The Grim Grotto"", comes out tomorrow, and I will be at the bookstore first thing in the morning to grab my copy!"
3,"Book 1, a Series of Unfortunate Events",I did not receive any acknowledgement of my order and waited several weeks to get the book.
3,A Series of unfortunate events,My book that i read was A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I thought it was a good book. A good part in the book is when Violet signs the paper with her left hand when she had to sign it with her strong hand in order for the marraige to be a real marraige. So that means that it was not complete. A bad part is when Violet got cought tring to save her sister. Her sister was hanging from a tower. If anything went bad during the wedding she would fall off of the tower and die. Then while the wedding was going on Violets sister escaped and then Violet messed it all up. Then Count oalf's assistant turned off the lights and they all got away.
1,The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events - Book 1),"I bought this book for my daughter who is 8. I decided to read it first though and am so glad I did! Now, there is no way known I will give it to her. This is an INCREDIBLY sinister and disturbing book. It may be very well-written but it is about child abuse and the threat [harm]. The supposedly ""good"" grown-ups are stupid and/or powerless, and the bad grown-ups are truly nasty without being even the slightest bit amusing. The children survive the horrible events by using their wits. While this sounds like it might be a good thing, the situations are entirely possible and real children would have wound up [harmed], dead or both. As is, even the fictitious children only just manage to escape. If your child is the least bit sensitive, don't buy this book."
5,2nd best after Harry Potter,This book is number 2 after Harry Potter It rulz. If you want a book full of sadness but also full of dark humour this is the book for you. It's easy to read so you can finish it easily it took me one day to finish it but I couldn't put it down!
4,Great Sadness Brings Great Enjoyment,"I am an Elementary Education major and absolutely adored this book. The orphan children are easy to relate to, yet bring you into a whole other world through their wild experiences. I highly reccomend this book to readers of all ages!"
5,Not Just for Kids,"I started reading this in a checkout line at the store, and I was so intrigued by it, I bought it and rented the movie that night. I am so thrilled to have stumbled into this series and I am going to buy all of them. This 38 year old is reallying enjoying these books!"
4,Good Book for 9-11 Year Olds,"I recently read this book and it was fairly good, and I'm sure if I were younger I would have enjoyed it more. You are introduced to Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire whose parents just died in a tragic fire. They are sent to live with Count Olaf who is horrible to them and is desperate to steal their fortune. The whole book is about their experiences living with Count Olaf and how badly they hate it their. It's kind of funny how Lemony Snicket tries to explain everything to you. I think he's making fun of child authors who try to explain things that are obvious. Anyway, this was a fairly good book and a quick read for 9-11 year olds."
4,Lemony Snicket Triumphs!,"My brother got this last Christmas and he loves it! However, I prefer the hardcover edition and that's the one I have.Warning: This book does not have a happy ending, only humorous moments."
4,How Unfortunate,"The Series of Unfortunate Events is about three orphans who lost their parents in a horrible fire, and has to move in with a relative. The relative is a wicked, mischief, fortune hungry man named Count Olaf. He treats the children badly by beating them sometimes. Like for example, he slaps Klaus sometimes but doesn't hit Violet because he's trying to marry her, (she's only 14 years old). And Sunny is just an infant so he really doesn't hurt her. The Baudelaire children will inherit their parents' fortune when they reach 18 years old. That's the only reason he wants to marry Violet. But, if you're interested in misfortunes, criminals, and unlucky children then you should read this book."
3,A good book for kids,Was curious and read this book... I would recommend it for a child to read. Intelligent children and despicable adults.
3,Just a Mediocre Beginning,"I read a lot of kids books. And I mean a lot. I usually love fanatasy books, but this one just wasn't up to par.Unlike Harry Potter, or even the lesser known Silver on the Tree series by Susan Cooper, or Taran Wanderer by Lloyd Alexander, this book just felt empty.Although the black humour and magic will appeal to kids now, these books are a fad, and don't have enough substance to provoke much thought - or retain the interest of an adult.Although there is nothing particularily wrong with these books, for the money, there's nothing that spectacular in them either."
4,Unfortunate Events,OMG just finished! It's so good I asked my mom if I could read this late. I recommend this to people who love sarcastic and dark stories.
5,"Sad , Depressing , and Entertaining!","This is a book about three young children Violet,Klaus, and Sunny whose parents die in a fire, there mantion is burnt to the ground.So they have to go livewith there only living relative Count Olaf.I liked it because the Baudelaire children are desperately trying to make their lives the way they want them to be, but Count Olaf kind of turns that hope down. Let's just say he is not the kind of relative you would like to have as the only living one. So that sort of makes their lives even worse than it already is. The effort in this book is amazing, and tragic. But it is still one of the best books I have ever read. If you like this book, you like depressing things. That doesn't mean don't read it. I'd just say it's the best."
4,Marriage madness,It was awesome but very at the same time it's like you didn't know what was going to happen next
3,"O.K., but not the best.","This book was pretty good. The only part I really liked was when Count Olaf tried to marry Violet,inherit the Baudilare fortune and kill the 3 kids.Like the book says, If you like books with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book."
1,How aptly titled,"A bad beginning to a dreary series. Can't believe that anyone would like the way these are written. The story could actually be better without all the sidelines giving definitions to the reader. But then I suppose the author was working under a deadline and word count. No, this is not Harry Potter and should not even be considered in the same class. Drivel, in this I mean it is badly written."
1,One of the most horrible books!!,"I checked this book out of the library because I'd read a lot of good reviews on it but still didn't want to spend nine bucks to buy it. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made! Though the Baudelaire children do not display any charisma (they are slow and dim-witted), Snicket nevertheless pulls readers in by making us care for them because they are poor orphans. This is a clever ploy by Snicket, because I wanted to finish the book to see if the Baudelaires ever do become happy. But true to form, they do not. Even more slow and dim-witted than the Baudelaire children are the adults around them, who realize too late that the menacing Count Olaf is evil. This book is frustrating to read because all of the characters are so bumbling and stupid. Unless you like to read books about children who are in an endless circle of misery and are too dumb to get themselves out of it for longer than five minutes, do not read this book."
5,AMAZING!!!,I thought this was gonna be Horrible book... BUT NO!!!It Was simply......amazinggg!!!i mean it went into a lot of detail.....READ IT!!!!!
5,this book is in,this book is more very bad events for vioet klause and sunny but now they are sent to a penthouse where everything is in or out as you can see orhans are in so are pinstrips suits and living on the 84th floor I will not tell any more so enjoy this book
4,None,A lot of peple think this is a very sad and scary book and do not want to read it but i am intrested in what is going to happen next with the poor chilren. i do feel kind bad for them but i find these books very intresting and creative. thank you mr. snicket for writing these books. now i will always have something to read.
4,My son loves this series!,"I have a 9 year old who is very fussy about what he reads. He's not a passionate reader like his big sister so when he started reading this first book in the series I wasn't sure he'd be interested in it. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw him read the book over the course of a couple of days and reading without any prompting from me or his father. He's now read books 1,2,3 and is currently reading 4. He says they're all very exciting and interesting. I'm so happy I pushed him to start the first book."
1,BOOOOO!!!,"This book was absolutely horrible! I mean, really! The whole series is crazy! I mean, what's the point! The books are awful! I mean, everything comes out happily, but no, can't have them actually being HAPPY! No, no, it's like being happy is against all the rules! It was awful! I don't see why everyone else thinks it is so good! It is NOT good! Don't get this book!"
1,"Poor writing, poor plot, poor characters - don't bother!","This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Not only is the plot dull and uninspired, but the writing is horrible. One of the most annoying aspects is the authors irritating way of taking time out of the story to define words! An example would be ""in a rickety cart - rickety here meaning..."" I prefer when writers allow me to decide which words I know or don't know and decide when to use a dictionary.I like the idea of a ""gothic"" children's series with dark and dangerous mysteries, but this is certainly not it. Save your money. This book is terrible."
1,Miserable little book,"The author oh so cleverly warns you this a dark, dreary book where bad things happen. Believe that. It's not cute and it's not clever. It's a depressing book. The whole selling point of this book is that it's short and fun. It's short, yet too long, because it is not fun. One reviewer says the series improves. I'll never know because I definitely will not waste my time trying to find out."
1,Do not buy this book for your child!!!,"I am a teacher. I loved allof the Harry Potter books and was told that this was a similar series. Wrong. This book is awful. It is about three orphans who are physically & psychologically abused by their caretaker. It also dumbs-down the vocabulary, by explaining what each word means in the text of the story (as if you are reading a dictionary.) I couldn't even finish it and I don't say that about many children's books."
1,"Inappropriate for children, distasteful for adults","I am so glad that I read this book just before giving the set as a present! The first chapter or so and book description gave the impression of the kind of droll humor I love. However, I actually found the contrast between the light tone and the sadistic aspects of the story disturbing. Given the allusions to pederasty, and the torturing of a baby, I would say this book is wholly inappropriate for children, young adults, and anyone with any sensibilities. Time to shop for a replacemnt present!"
3,A Latecomer's Opinion,"Despite all the hype I've been hearing during the last few years over the Series of Unfortunate Events books, I just finally read the first one. I didn't particularly care for the writing style; in fact, I found it rather annoying. But the story was so captivating that I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one sitting...I guess it's partly our morbid curiosity that has made these books so popular. All in all, a good story by a not so good writer. I will probably read the other books in the series just because I'm curious about what happens to these poor, unfortunate children."
3,Interesting to read,I liked this book keeping in mind that it is for kids. I have read much more compelling books for kids though and this book didn't live up to the hype for me.
4,Really good,It was amusing and mysterious just the way i like it.Sometimes i want to read or buy all the series.
5,This book is awesome!!!,This book was filled with mystery and adventure. If you like sad books you'll like this series!!! I know I did!
3,a series of unfortunate events the bad beginng,my favorite section is when olaf house burns down. also i thought the baudelaire children are stuck. they have to live with olaf he treats them poorly violet is the clever one sunny the baby likes to bite stuff. klaus likes to read count olaf trie to kill the children in the book buthe doesnt succedby adam alonzo
4,The Ersatz Elevator,The Ersatz Elevaator is a great book in all. It shows how hard orphans' life can be and Esme is what the heck kind of a person. I learned that life can be hard while searching for Count Olaf. You should read the Ersatz Elevator! :)
4,The Bad Begining,The Bad BeginningIn the Bad Beginning Count Olof tries to take the three Baudelaire kids' fortune. The three kids will not allow this. They have to stop him. He makes them suffer. This story takes you in for a sad ride. This story is crazy.Count Olof tries to marry Violet who is a 16 year old girl who has access to the money. He thinks if he marries one of them he canHe makes it worse by making the kids do lots of work. get the money.Count Olof lies to people a lot. He tries to make himself look good by making the kids look bad. He thinks the world revolves around him.The story is bad but it gets worse. You think something good is going to happen and then boom a terrible thing happens. The new step dad takes the orphans in. Lots of things turn bad. There lives turn up side down. An evil man now controls their whole world. They can only try to escape. I recommend this book because it has lots of twists.
1,"Horrible, creepy, not for young kids/teens!","This book is horrible and creepy - from the children losing their parents in a fire, to being shipped off to their spooky uncle, Count Olaf. The Count threatens and mistreats the kids, and then plots to marry the eldest daughter Violet (who is like 12) in order to take over the family fortune. I would not want a young person/teenager to read this book. It was billed as Harry-Potter-like, but it totally lacked the sweetness and humor of Harry. I was creeped out and disappointed!"
2,"Somewhat funny, but mostly a disappointment","I bought this book because the jacket sounded hilarious. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Written for a younger audience, even youngsters with a good vocabulary would probably find this book dull and condescending, with its vocabulary lessons every page or two (if you haven't read the book, trust me, every other page there is a word that is given, along with is definition...this gets really old after the second chapter).While I thought that the unfortunate events that kept happening throughout the book were funny, the book couldn't hold my interest. I kept waiting for something more to happen. Also, the whole notion of one's legal guardian trying to marry them really turned me off. I thought that was quite repulsive.For Dahl fans who liked the book Matilda, maybe this one will be sufficient. However, I cannot give this book more than two stars."
5,One of the best books that I've read,"This book is sad but exciting.The reason I gave this book five stars is because it is a great book,but if you don't like sad stories you should not read this one."
4,"""Readers"" enjoy","I loved this book. From the gothic looking covers, end papers, and rough cut edges to the dry satire inside. I enjoyed the narrator's use of pretentious vocabulary -- carefully explained in an aside to the audience -- to describe the action. This would be an excellent read aloud book if you love the sound of the English language. I plan to read the rest of the series, and hope I continue to have fun with the Baudelaire's misfortunes."
2,A Book About Bad Things,The Bad Beginning is a scary book. A lot of bad things happen. Count Olaf does a lot of terrible things.You should read this book if you like to see people rescue others. I liked the Baudelaire children because they had good ideas and they never gave up. Klaus was very smart.People shouldn't read this book if they don't like books where bad things happen.
1,J.K. Rowling wannabe,"This is a total ripoff of the Harry Potter series. HELLO? The boy even looks like Harry Potter! They have the same freaking glasses! How could anyone who likes Harry Potter like this book? Bad things happen to Harry Potter too at the beginning you know. I would suggest you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone before you read it so you can see as I have, that this is a total copy of it. Harry Potter is much more original. Like, did this guy, Lemony Snicket, think that people wouldn't notice how his books is like Harry Potter? Does he think kids are stupid and wouldn't notice such things? You know what else are copycats? NSYNC copied BSB, Pepsi copied Coke, Britney copied Mariah..."
1,Sick & twisted. No youth (or adault) should read it.,Things like a guardian trying to force a 14 year old girl to marry and tying up an infant and hanging her in a cage 30 feet in the air are REVOLTING. Why would anyone think this is appropriate reading material for teens or children?
1,This was not a good book,"This book was bad , I hated it. this book makes Goldy locks look good. The reason is it has Sex terms like count Olaf always trying to violate poor violite also violate gets shot by a hook and starts bleeding everywere also it seemed Lemony Snicket is trying to be funny and hes not maby its just Europian comedy that I don't get but it was not funny . also the kids are preety stupid cheesy the kid is upsessed with books the other can make anything out a tooth pick a brisk and a loly pop so basickly tak my advise do not read this book"
1,Was disturbed and dismayed by this book.,"I bought this book at my children's school book fair after reading some of the reviews here. I believed from the text on the book jacket that there must be something delightful and darkly humorous about these books. Unfortunatly all I found was a thin plot line, some rather intellgent but somewhat clueless children, and conniving relative with muderous intents. Also he and his friends have some veiled ""desires"" towards the oldest teenage daughter.I see no true value to this book, other than an excellent writing style and an excellent vocabulary. I for one will not let my children rea"
4,An interesting series.,"""The Bad Beginning"" is not a book I would have chosen in a million years, but I thank my book club for choosing it. I do think this book is a bit too much for juvenile readers, and I think it would be more suitable for teenagers. It's written for the young reader, but its material isn't. I found it interesting how the author defined some words, and while it took a while to get used to it, I think it will benefit the young reader greatly. I must admit to being a tad repulsed about the ""almost"" marriage of Count Olaf and Violet. I may just go ahead and read the other books in this series. I recommend."
1,"Derivative, smug, and dressed-up-to-sell","The School Library Journal review for this book summed up most of what I might write. Will Amazon feature it here? These are slow-moving downers, self-consciously written and pretentious. The gimmick of using big words and then defining them got pretty stale, even for my fourth-grader. Couldn't a big publisher devote the same amount of energy finding and packaging an original book that will last? Ursula would not be amused. Adults can write for children. Will anyone publish them?"
1,The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket,"I am very disappointed in the rating of this book. New York Times Bestseller List published it as age 10 and up. I wasn't going to purchase it for our library and then Booklist reviewed it and also had the age limit as age 10 and up. I purchased it and got a complaint right off quick. I read the book and find it to be very dark humor. In this day of violence and terrorisim, I find this book to be horrendous. The villain is out to kill three children. The mention of him marrying a 14 yr. old child to get her fortune is very suggestive and there is no mention of the care of the infant child, only torture. I had purchased three books before I realized the content. Needless to say they have been moved to our young adult section which is for ages 13 and up. I just feel it is not appropriate for the age level it is being suggested for. I hate to think I have to read every book before I put it on the shelf. That is what I am relying on my reviewers for."
1,"I don't care what they say, THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK!!!","This book creeped me out, and not the good kind of creeped out. It was disturbing. The book was nothing but kids being abused in horrible ways. There were more than blatant sexual overtones to the story, and it's being marketed to the 9-12 age group. Count Olef, the children's creepy old adopted father, tries to force the 14 year old girl, Violet, to marry him, and threatens to kill her baby sister if she doesn't. There is a reference made to the ""wedding night."" The whole thing was just sick. I'm 17, and I don't know if i'm gonna be able to get to sleep tonight, after reading this story. Please don't give this book to a young child."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!,"I have to hand it to Lemony, he got off to a good start. But afterwards, he just starts to drone on and on, and simply put, it gets boring after a while. I myself fell victim to buying the first five books and reading them, but jeez! does Lemony Fresh or whatever his name is start to drone on. ""Gahgo"" said Sunny, (the baby) which probably ment something like, PLEASE STOP WRITING THESE BOOKS, PEACHY SHMICKETT OR WHATEVER YOUR DUMB PEN NAME IS!!!!"
1,"""Pucker Up And Puke""","Dear Readers,If you have ever wondered what happens when writers spend too much time in grad school reading theory, then you have an idea of what to expect from this author's texts.All I can say is that if you like to read books with shallow characters, thin plots, unredeeming and perverse themes, and more self-conscious ""Lemony"" prose than will fit in one's pitcher, then these books are for you. Perhaps you can find a way to make lemonade with them.I'm on a new low-acid diet myself. I am bound to record that these tales are better classified as ""when post-modern meets camp meets ...."" Robert McCloskey showed us in LENTIL that people often want to suck lemons. In this case, it is the lemons that suck."
3,The Bad Beginning,"The book I am reviewing is called The I think it was ok because I didn't hear all of it, but it was ok so far. I wouldn't recommend it because I didn't hear all of it. My favorite part was the end. It was sad. That was my book review."
3,Could Have Been 5 Stars,"I thought this was a good book, until I read the rest in the series. The more I read this book the more I think that he could have been better. I've read it 4 times and all the rest of the books seemed good. Another thing is that those poor children have been through so much and it's just sad how when everything starts to get better for them, something goes wrong. For example when their parents die they get sent to a ""distant relative""; well, personally I think they should have checked background information on Count Olaf."
2,"Interesting, but scary!","I was very excited to hear about this series because I was looking for something good to read until the next Harry Potter book came out. However, I was glad in the end I had only purchased the first one because it scared me a great deal. Maybe it is the new-mom syndrome, but part of the story that dealt with a perilous situation for the baby horrified and terrified me. Plus, there seemed to be some underlying sexual undertones between some of the adults and children. As an educator, I did like how the author explained more complex vocabulary terms, but it did get a little old to an adult reader."
3,The Bad Beginning Review,"I think ""The Bad Beginning"" is to frightening for children under the age of fifteen or sixteen. This book draws you into the fear and the anxiety the children feel from being helpless and left in a dreadful environment. The book made me want to continue reading to see what was going to happen next, to these three helpless orphan children. The descriptions of the friends that Count Olaf had, the lifestyle the children were made to live in and the neglect and torture that was inflicted upon them, by Count Olaf and his friends, was to tremendous for me. In addition there was the possibility of a wonderful ending after the children were deprived from the life they were accustomed to, when there parents were alive, and the book didn't give the children the opportunity to be happy when the possibility arose. The man with the hooks for hands is unceasingly engraved in my memory. I wouldn't recommend this book for young children, unless you have a child you need to scare straight."
5,Unfortunate Events is Great,"This book was really great! It was funny, and sad all at the same time. The three children were living a great life, when all of a sudden their world was shatter. They find themselves having to live with long lost relatives. They realize that their realatives are trying to get rid of them so they could acquire their inheritance. The kids play a game of cat and mouse with their uncle, Klaus Olaf.` I recommend this book to all middle school age kids. Thumbs Up! I give it 5 stars."
4,What a great book.........,The book I am reviewing is The Bad Beginning. It is written by Lemony Snicket. It is the first book in the series called A Series of Unfortunate Events.I liked this book because it was interesting and funny. It doesn't sound good if you only read the first page but if you read into the story you really find it interesting.I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't ddecide to read a book by its first page or cover. If you like the first book then you should keep reading all the way up to the tenth book and so on. I am on the fourth book right now. lemony Snicket is a great author.
5,My Review of this Awesome Book!,"This book is about three children whose lives don't start well and they don't end well neither. In my own words, I would say that trouble is a refridgerater and they are magnets. But it was a very good story even though it scared me some. I can't wait til I get the next book!"
4,A Different Book,"Lemony Snicket has opened up eyes of all young readers by changing his story around. It is not a normal kind of story that you would see in every day life, but Unfortunate events that keep on happening to these 3 poor childeren throughout the series. He has a unique way of showing his talent in writing.Which is different and good.This story also has alot of humor. I recommend this book to all readers who liked to get sucked up in books like you are there, at the scene watching it happen. It is really a very good, well written story."
3,The Bad Begining Part II.,I think that this book has a good start.The only thing that is sad in the begining is that there are three little kids at the beach.They are having a lot of fun and I mean a lot of fun.Until they recieve very very bad news.The bad news was sent by their parents good friend Mr.Poe.He tells them that their parents has just died in the house because of a horriable fire.I think that this book is a book that I'm starting to like this book more than Harry Potter.The Bad Begining is one of those books that are very interesting.I find The Bad Begining a book that I would reccomed to others such like my mother.The reason I think my mother would like this book because she likes books that are very interesting such like this book is.The Bad Begining really starts off as a bad begining.The Bad Begining has a lot of things in it that I really don't enjoy.Like because they are orphans they are being treated very bad.
2,YAWWWWWNNNNNN!!!,"I have a hard time understanding how this book is so popular. The idea is ok and starts off kinda cute, but it lacks any real substance. I kept waiting for some great twist or turn and nothing happened. Then I thought, well maybe there will be some huge climax, and again I was wrong. The part where he explains what certain words mean seems like we are idiots. If he wants kids to understand it, then use different words. I also didn't like talk of marriage to his niece. Thats not something I would want my son to read. I'm not sure if I'll read book 2 or not. Hopefully the movie is better. Jim Carey is such a goofball, he can make anything good. This author however, I'm not to sure about. The Harry Potter series in SO much better."
3,"Good story, Disappointing Author.","I give this book an A for over all concept.I give this book an F for the authors treatment of its audience.The general story is good and keeps you entertained enough.The author needs to stop under estimating his readers. At the oddest times the author finds it neccessary to give a definition to a work or words. It got to a point that I think the other was just trying to get up to a certain word count rather than try to tell a good story.Thanks to series like Harry Potter, many kids are finally reading. If a child can get thru Harry Potter with out needing to pick up a dictionary or ask thier parents a question about a word they certainly dont need either for this series. /rant off"
5,The First Book in a Great Series,The book is called the Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket. This book is a very good book because it is very suspensful and adventurous. I have read the whole series and they are all very exciting. Lemony Snicket is one of my favorite authors. One day at Briny Beach the Baudelaires recieve horrible news. Their parents were killed in a fire that burns their house down! They are left in the hands of their evil relative Count Olaf. Will something turn their luck around? If you like suspensful and adventurous books then you will like this book. It will make you want to read the whole series.
4,Fun grey humor - esp when read by Tim Curry!,"I agree with one of your reviewers who says Lighten Up! These are fun reads and not to be taken so seriously. Not all of life is flowers and roses. It is good for you to walk your children through the dark side of life and here Lemony Snicket has given us a comical view of it, especially with the wonderful vision provided by the voices of the very talented Tim Curry. Unfortuneately, he does not read all of the volumes, and is sorely missed.These are not Harry Potter books, so don't look for masterpieces, but they are fun reads."
5,Amazing,"This was the most amazing children's book I have read in a long time (other than Harry Potter, of course). I went through all 9 books in 3 days, I couldn't put them down! For the people who say they are inappropriate for children, you must be sheltering your kids. I think these books are wonderfully creative and would recommend them over and over again."
5,"A Book About A Marvelous Elevator, Or is it Ersatz?","This Amazing book is full of surprises. Once you pick it to read you can't stop. If I had stopped reading it, I would have been thinking of what could have happened to the unlucky orphans. The Baudelaire's come across many unfortunate events in this story. In fact, after you read this sad but yet great story, you won't wonder why the fantastic author ""Lemony Snicket"" Has named his series ""The Series of Unfortunate events"".In this book all 3 Baudelaire's work together to try to get their friends, Duncan and Isadora out of Count Olaf's clutches but they have to try to convince their new guardians that live in a penthouse on Dark Avenue that Gunther isn't an actioneer. That he is Count Olaf in disguise. Will they convince them soon enough or will they be too late to save their friends?"
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! What happens to the Baudelairs isn't great but Snicket is aware of that and makes a joke about it, and it'd HILARIUOS! I get really scared about scary books, so I was uneasy about reading it when my dad bought it for me, but when i read it I wasn't scared, I was excited. Somebody sad they would give this book 10 stars if they could, i would give it 100 stars! THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"
2,"Too dark for children, but not written for adults.","As a fan of the likes of Invader Zim and Edward Gorey, I thought I should give this series a try. However, the books are written at such a low reading level that I could not recommend them to anyone out of middle school. The author has an annoying habit of explaining every little term that I'm already familiar with (I hate it when authors question my intelligence). I finished reading the book because it was quite short, and I was somewhat amused at the outrageous schemes of Count Olaf and his crew. However, in reality, if the kids would have just called the police, the authorities would have gone beserk and intervened in America anyway. The book lacks any subtlety or complexity. Not recommended."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"When I first heard of this series, I was mildly intrigued. Then I heard the series being likened to Roald Dahl's books, and, having worn my childhood copy of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* to bits, I had to check them out. Mr. Snicket is no Roald Dahl. Sure, both writers understand that a lot of kids like to read about pretty gruesome stuff. But, where Dahl's stories are inventive and charming, *The Bad Beginning* is pretty simplistic and derivative. Things seemed to resolve themselves a bit too quickly. It's not a bad book, just not worthy of its hype. If I happened to find the next book in the series lying in the street, I'd probably read it, but otherwise, probably not."
3,The same review for both - the first and second books,Sometimes you don't know if LS is writing for kids or for adults. Sometimes he explains every 'strange' word for kids and sometimes he assumes that you have a vast experience in life. He made intelligent characters and incredible goofy ones.So if you want to read this book don't expect too much but read it while you have nothing else to read and you want to read something... like myself with the two firsts of the series that were in my doughter's bedroom... It'll be long down the road till I'll read the next one.
1,luv it,"good book , makes u interested, very sad, sorta happy, short, clever, weird, cool, fun, old, has good characters. amazing"
5,Lemony Snicket rocks.,Everybody should by this book it is the book of a lifetime!I would say it is my favorite book.I read this book and I wish I could go back in time and read it over and over again!This book changes your life!
1,The Bad Beginning lives up to its name.,"Let's start out by saying that the only reason this book even got one star was because zero stars wasn't an option. I've read a LOT of children's books and this is far, far down on my list. The main problems with this book (and the whole series) is that the plot is dull, it's poorly written, there's no character development, you can't connect with any of the characters, it's depressing, and it's a teacher's worst nightmare if you value SHOW not TELL since the entire book reads like a plot summary. The appeal for these books is that they introduce vocabulary words, however what a waste of paper to do so in such an unimaginative way. There are so many books in this series, and it's probably because they only take about an hour each to churn out. The ONLY good thing about this book was that it was returnable. Let me plead, there are so many wonderful and creative children's books out there, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH!"
5,The Bad Beginning,"Reviewer: Larry Loamhedge, Mousonto,Cheestario ,SwissanadaThis is the best book EVER! Here in Mousonto I've gotten my paws on every SOUE book in the stores. The movie is coming out soon,and it looks better than the books, but they are still good!First Jacques Lafur with Mousewall, Joanne Rowlpaw with Harry Pot De Cheese, J. R. R. Tolkomouse with Lord of the Rats, now this! This the best book EVER!"
5,The Bad Beginning,"This book is about the three Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus and Sunny.Their fortune began to weaken when their parents died in a fire that destroyed their house as well."
2,We are not amused,"and Queen Victoria would not be either. This is a dry and boring tome dressed up in the press releases to be witty and entertaining and it ain't, folks."
3,The glummiest book iv'e read,"If you don't like unhappy endings, you shouldn't even need to read this review because this is the glummiest book iv'e ever read. it has bad events all the time and nearly no pleasureable events.Even though it is the gloomy book , i still think it is a good book. It is fun to read how the children do everything differently from what they used to do while they lived with teir parents. i also like the way they use to overcome the mean man they lived with and how try to make their friendshelp with out knowing that they helping or what is going on"
1,Zero stars would be more appropriate,"My son picked this book up at his school library. After reading it he handed it to me a suggested I read it. Now I know why - he wanted to discuss everything that is wrong with this book and try to figure out why people would like it. It has no decent plot, has no character development,is not well written, and is just plainly disturbing with an old man planny to marry a young child, and abusing other children. This is not entertainment."
3,the not so good book,The bad beginning was not so good because it wouldtalk about other things than the book like when theytalked about someone they would talk about what theydid yesterday it was ok but not so good as the otherbook the wide window i actually got this book thanThe Bad Beginning it had more detailss and descriptionso thats why i think it is a not so good book.
1,Despicable,I purchased this book to read before giving to my grandchild. Glad I did. This is the worst piece of children's writing around and the author should be taken to task - in court - for perpetrating this on the public - and children in general.
1,Horrible,"I wouldn't even rate this book one star! It probally was an idea from Harry Potter. He made these books so depressing so dont read them they are horrible. They are so boring also, read the Harry Potter books first they are much better."
1,Yuck!,"The only reasons I can think of to read this book are that it might introduce some new vocabulary, it promotes mechanical engineering, and the curious author bio on the jacket. Dull characters, dull story."
1,A BAD Beginning!,"This is possibly the worst beginning to a series EVER written! I mean, whenever I try to go back and read all the books over I always can't because this is the most boring book ever! Waste of money, waste of time. Buy something else please."
2,pointless,"Maybe if I hadn't heard so many wonderful things about this book (as well as the entire line of follow-ups) I wouldn't be reviewing it so harshly.This book is nothing but pointless, weightless children's fluff. Amusing if you are under 10 years of age & looking for some light (ULTRA light) reading, but completely unsatisfying if you crack the cover expecting something more along the lines of 'Harry Potter'.The plot is very thin, and I can only assume it's due to this being one of a series, and thus the overall tale of the Baudelaire orphans is spread over the 10+ novels that have since been released. But this left the first book with very little substance, and left me feeling like I didn't care enough to give it another go with the second installment."
2,I tried to like it but...,"I started reading this book fully expecting to like it. The back cover was wonderfully grim with it's Poe-ish tone and it's Edward Gorey-like illustrations. However, I found the book to be simply grim with little or no tongue-in-cheek humor. The general tone of the book is so depressing that it just wasn't worth it to me to keep reading. I would not particularly recommend this book, although others obviously favor it."
5,Definatly worth it!,"My friend suggested this book to me. At first I didn't want to buy it because our tastes are so different when it comes to books, but I'm really glad I did. I liked this book because of the way it stayed to the basic plot but still added backround imformation to make it fun to read. The way the author talks about the book on the back of the cover may make it sound like it's a completely depressing book but really the way the three kids keep their hopes up more than makes up for it. Also if, like me, your waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out and you need something to read I suggest this. Even if the book is suggested for 9-12 year olds, older kids will also like it too. I'm almost 13 and usually read books meant for people slightly older than me, but this book didn't seem to young for me at all."
4,Taylor's book review,"this was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed reading it. It is a book that will keep you reading and interesteed the whole way through it, you wont want to put it down. I would reccomend this book to almost any body all the Series of unfortunate event books are good. It is one of those books that is pretty easy to follow but still has you on the edge of your seat through it all. I have read this book three times and it never gets boring. So if you like action and adventure you should definetly buy this book. You might even want to get the other books in the series."
5,The Bad Beginning Review,"This is a great book, and I reccomend this series to most people, because it's got humor, suspense, action, and mystery all slamed into one series. The whole series is about these three children, Violet, the oldest who is 14 and loves to invent things. Klaus, 11, loves to read books about anything. Sunny, the youngest, about 12 months old, likes to bite things, anything really. Their family is VERY wealthy. So anyway, the series is about these three children and their unfortunate events that occur after their parents die in from a fire that happened at their house, and they meet a horrible person who keeps going after their fortune. You'll have to find out what happens in the 9 book series."
4,wonderful,This book is wonderful. It unpredictable you don't know what going to happen. From the front to the back you want to turn the pages because the book has a hook hanger at the end of each page.
2,Interesting,"This was an interesting book, although I thought it had a stronger beginning than ending. The three children are good characters, smart and unique. It is an interesting idea that they have such bad luck, similar to say, an Edward Gorey book.The villain, Count Olaf, is truly repulsive, and treats the children horribly. Some of my points of contention arise in the segment involving the Count. First of all, it is very hard for me to believe that the children, having many opportunities to do so, would not tell their kind neighbor Justice Strauss how horribly they were being treated by the Count. Intelligent children such as these, I'm sure would know when the help of an outside adult is needed, and it is hard for me to believe that Mr. Poe, the dead parents' friend would not believe them when they tried to tell him. Also I feel this book failed to build up a sufficient amount of suspense.However, it was interesting, and I am curious to read book two of the series."
4,The Not-So-Bad Beginning,"In ""The Bad Beginning,"" we are introduced to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, who suddenly become heirs to a very large fortune when their parents die in a fire. The encounter all sorts of misery when their guardian attempts to steal their inheritance.This book does contain many depressing things, but it documented in a way that lets the reader percieve the humor in each situation. Also, the Baudelaire children have a camaraderie that helps them (and the reader) survive each event more or less intact.The Bad Beginning is a quick, lighthearted read that is an excellent introduction to the series."
4,The Start of a Bad Thing,"Have you ever had that feeling that you are being watched or followed, when the hairs on the back of your neck shoot up like needles. This is what the Baudelaire orphans experince every where the go in their seemingly horrible lives. But befor we get ahead of our selves this is the beginning of a serise of unfortunate events where the man that is causeing this tension in the orphans life is reveled. A horriable man who will do ANYTHING to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune wich was left to the orphans when their parents, house, and all of their belongings were lost in a terriable fire.This book is so great that anybody of any age can enjoy it and its pure cruelty towrads the Baudelaire orphans. When you are done with this book you will be thanking Lemony Snicket the author for writting eight other books in the series because this book will get you so hooked after reading it that you will want to get to the nearest bookstore as soon as possible to get the next book."
4,Look out behind you!,"Yet another amazing book from Mr. Snicket. The intrigue comes back in the form of the two Quagmire triplets, being kept at the bottom of an elevator shaft. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny perform some simply amazing feats (Sunny climbs the wall with her teeth) and once again a friend who wishes to help them, Jerome, just can't seem to get anything done. After they met the doorman to 667 Dark Avenue, I kind of already had a feeling for what they were in for, and at the end, I was actually surprised that the children didn't figure out Count Olaf's plan when it was obviously right in front of their faces. Let's hope they stick together and catch the evildoer next time."
3,The Bad Begining was quite good.,"Having been an avid reader while growing up i'm ashamed to say that my interest in reading had faded. Between work and other commitments i barely can find time to read.I'd read about ""The unfortunate series of events"" in a magazine and i was intrigued,so i went and purchased it, after reading the first book i was very happy i did.The three main characters(Violet,Klaus,Sunny) are very charming and very resourceful.The story is very dark with the children losing their parents and being forced to live with a distant relative.Count Olafs main concern is to get his hands on the childrens money.He inflicts all sorts of horrible behavior upon the children,even threatening to kill Sunny to get her siblings to go along with his scheme.The way Violet was able to outmanuver Count Olaf was a little to cheesy for my taste.The narrative is a little annoying but i enjoyed the story well enough to over look it."
5,Deserving 5+ Stars!,"""The Bad Beginning"" is an excellent book for young people who want a story that's to the point and fun or for other people who just want a quick and enjoyable read. The story moves quickly, there are no boring details, and the characters are likable or detestable. Lemony Snicket isn't writing a story; the reader feels more like he's telling you a story. He helps and challenges the reader with his style of writing. Be glad it is one in a series of many!"
3,"A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book #1 The Bad Beginning","The Bad Beginning has to be one of my favorite books of all times along with the other Unfortunate Event Books. The story is about three miserable, depressed orphans named Violet, Klause, and baby Sunny. Their parents died in a fire that also destroyed their house and personal belongings. When Violet comes of age, she will inherit her parent's fortune. But, until then, a devious, no wait, better make that a pure evil man named Count Olaf, is trying every trick in and out of the book to ruin their plans. Lemony Snicket has vowed to continue writing these tragic tales, for it is what he does best. I recommend this series to anyone who likes nonstop events one after the other."
5,A quick but satisfying read....,"This was a fun book to read. At a short 160 pages, I was able to read it in one quick setting and look forward to reading the others in the series.My son, age 7, received this series as a Christmas present. He finished the first book, which he read quickly, and started to tell me some of the plot line. Well, my wife and I decided that I better read this book to make sure it was okay for a seven year old.Nothing good happens to these poor children throughout the entire book, but, the events happen in such curious ways, and the writer places much wit into the scenarios that I felt it was fine for him to continue the series. I will say that I believe that it is important for a parent to sit down with their child before allowing them to read this book and explain that it is all in fun. I did this with my son and then he felt better about it.I think that the big problem now will be who gets the next book first!"
5,"The Ersatz Elevator, by Lemony Snicket","For the sixth time Lemony Snicket wrote a book about three orphaned children who always somehow have something bad happen to them. That is why his books are called the Series of Unfortunate Events. I thought the book was good because it had a lot of danger and excitement. It made me want to keep on reading, because each chapter kept you hanging on for the next. I am now reading number seven and am looking forward to number eight."
4,A series of Unfortunaate events.,"The Bad beginning is a great book. It is(obviously) about unlucky kids. They are orphans because their parents get killed in a fire. They stay with their parents friend mr. Poe until they find a family member that they can stay with, and the family member is...Count Olaf Ahhhhhh! he ends up being he big villain of the series. Unlike the other reviewers I think that the chracters are quite well done in these noveels.Lemony Sniket ( the pen name of Daniel Handler) does a great job as a writer in the stories, and it is written in my favorite form, third person. So far there are eight novels in the series and another scheduled for this October. So I would reccomend this series of books for ages 8 and over, and for children who enjoy suspense....... Grade AGoodbye~~~~~~~~~~Dan~~~~"
4,The Ersatz Elevator,When I finished this book The Ersatz ElevatorI really enjoyed it.In case you don't know the Baudlaires orphansI will introduce you to them.The Baudelaire orphans have a very bad life.Their parents died in a fire and they have lived with many foster parents but there is always something that goes wrong either their foster parents die or they have to leave them. Count Olaf who is a very bad guy was the Baudelaires' first foster parent. Mr. Poe who is in charge of the orphans a new home. Count Olaf has been after the very sneaky and along with his theater troupe. Do you think he will get the fortune?
4,The Esratz Elevator,The esratz Elevator was an Interesting book.Orphans are in so the Baudileres got themselves some new owners. They are Esme and Jermey Squalor.Esme is only into whats in and whats out and Jermey is kind but not helpful at all. The Squalor's apartment is huge. It has 74 rooms and on the 48th floor. Count Olaf comes back in action in one of his trials in trying to get the Baudileres fortune. He is obviously in disguise. He's name is gunther and he says he is an auctioneer. He's pretending to be not speaking english correct. He hid the baudileres friends which are the quagmires into the apartment building itself. No one can belive them about Gunther or the Quagmires.
5,misfortune for the baudelaires is everywhere,after the bad time at the austre academy the baudelaires come to live with the squalors yet another misfortune happens in this story count olaf disguises himself as a in auctioneer his name was gunther just like all the other books they dont believe that all the disguises count olaf has been is really count olaf so the baudelaires have to prove they are right and have to live through all of this madness untill violet is of age unlike other authors lemony snicket is a sad author writing down this miserable story hope this was a good review for you
3,Not really suitable for children,"Finished reading this recently and I have mixed feelings. While I found it to be an entertaining and quick read, I am unsure about its appropriatness for its target audience. While I have absolutely no issue with the darker subject matter presented, I do have issues with the way in which some of these dark ideas are developed. Olaf is a wonderfully evil and looney character, we get that pretty clearly in the book as well as the theme that he will stoop to any level to attempt to get the childrens' inheritance. What I disagree with is that a lot of what Olaf and his cohorts do is unnecessary in a book aimed at children. They are just as evil without the drinking and without Olaf being quite so threatening and physically abusive. I just think that it was a bit harsh for young children. Reading (especially at that age) should be an enjoyable escape, not an uncomfortable experience.But then again, maybe I'm way off base here. I don't know."
3,Just ok,"I was looking for a smart sarcastic tone to a macabre background in this story, and I should have gone in with less assumption. The end is anticlimatic, and in today's age of ""nothing in the news but misery"" it wasn't the book I probably should have picked for my plane ride home for the holidays. I was expecting something craftier and ended the book feeling ""ho-hum""."
3,Meh...,"I've seen the movie before I read this book I liked the movie a lot, it was great, but the book was just ok I think I would have liked it better if I haven't seen the movie first and read the series first because without Jim Carey prancing around and the faster pace of the movie the book felt like it was lacking something."
2,Too creepy for young ones & too unrealistic for older ones,"I found the writing style interesting and enjoyable, but found the characters to be so stupid that I could not enjoy reading the story aloud to my 6 and 9-year-old children. I caught myself thinking again and again ""no one would do that"" Yet; the book was filled with seemingly real meanness and danger. I can't think of an appropriate age for this book because no one over 9 would find it believable and the creepiness is way too creepy for anyone under 12 in my opinion."
1,Depressing,If I could have given this book 0 stars I would have. My 10 yearold son read it and hated it. I decided to read it and for the life of me I can't figure out why anyone would want to read anyof these books. You would have to have a warped sense of humor tofind these books the least bit entertaining.
1,What is the big deal?,"What is the big deal? This is the most stupid story line I have ever read. I personally believe that all real life is boring, but if fantasy isn't your cup of tea (for me it's a big gulp) then read something more real lifish at least. You have to be pretty low if you are reuced to reading a story about the awful tortured lives of children. I am writing this review to tell people that even though these books are so poplar not to read them. Also heed the warning on the back cover which literally says if you like a book with any happiness in it at all then don't read this."
1,"Out of the Ordinary, but not Great","When I picked up this book I was full of great expectations. The children were talented, and I especially liked the biting part. THe book gradually dropped off, however, due in part to the authors obsession to share the meanings of everyday words. I found the plot to be lackluster, and predictable. I've read books 1,2, and 3 in the series, and each one shares pretty much the same plot. I would suggest that if you have an urge to read these books you should check them out at the library. The author points out in his letter on the back of the book that his novels are not ordinary novels, but contain only awful mishaps and no happy times. His words are true, but the unhappy quality in his books is the only thing that sets them apart."
3,Good,It was a good book and really had a lot of suspense but the ending was disappointing and lacked the emotion the rest of the book had
5,Learning experience,This book is so good that I couldn't put it down. Thank you for your wonderful book Lemony Snicket I appreciate it.
1,So dreadful I can hardly believe it was published,"When this novel was given to my son as a birthday present, the family proceeded to read it aloud, as is our custom. We're fiction lovers in this family; I'm a writer myself. My husband and I kept waiting for it to get better. No such luck. The ending was awful.If you're looking for a one-dimensional story, with no subplot, no character development, unbelievable sketches built around gimmicks rather than in-depth characters anyway, an ending we pretty much guessed long before the semi-melodramatic finale, loads of flaws in the plot, etc., you're really gonna enjoy this book.Others may wonder, as I do, what on earth is going on with HarperCollins these days. This is yet one more book from my earstwhile favorite publisher where the jacket copy is far more interesting than the book itself. Beneath the hype, a real stinker, sad to say."
2,"Engaging, yes, but very odd","I agree with previous reviewers that these books, while engaging enough to read in one sitting, are quite off-putting. I find the author's tendency to define words annoying. I will, however, admit that I get a certain amusement from the tongue-in-cheek, understated, British humor. Granted, I am an adult with a child of my own, but I don't think I would have enjoyed this series as a kid. The books have references that are way over the heads of the recommended reading level and very disconcerting for us adults. Klaus and Sunny (von Bulow, perhaps?), I mean really! Sure, Harry Potter has a dark side, but the dark side makes sense. These books seem to be misery for misery's sake. We have enough of that in this world, without promoting it in our pre-teen children. Try reading the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series, the ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" or even ""The Hobbit."" There's plenty of trouble in all of these, but plenty of fun, too."
4,Good Stuff,Captivating and heartfelt. This book brought me back to myself and reminded me just how important and necessary reading is for me to feel alive.
4,The Bad Beginning,Great series i read the book in two days and loved it. It is pretty suspenseful and at some times funny
5,Compact and Useful Kit,"I purchased this kit because I'm tired of having to buy a separate cable for every gadget i buy. I needed this one to connect my new printer to my laptop, although the plastic part of the male head of this kit was way too wide for my printer so i had to cut the sides with a knife.. There is supposed to be some standard to it but well.. Other than that it's a great compact kit and comes with a pouch (i have just seen even more compact ones out there that have retractable cables.. just so that you know)"
3,Not what I was looking for...,"Although the kit had 6 pieces like it claimed, none of the pieces were what I needed. I bought this product because I lost my USB cable for my GE E850 digital camera and couldn't transfer pictures to my computer. The kit did not include a piece that fit into my camera."
3,Resource directory nothing more,"A resource directory that needs to be updated badly. Even back in 2002 when I first purchased this book much of the information and resources needed updating. Save yourself the money, do an Internet such. It's much more up to date and if you have access to free wifi, it will only cost you a little bit of time."
5,Excellent JCL Reference The Only Book that Covers Best Practice Techniques,"This book covers the information needed to code JCL efficiently, consistently and improve exisitng JCL code."
1,Needs work,"Poorly done. Read Publisher Weekly's review from above, they are right on, but a little too nice. It's amazing what gets past editors' desks - the dialogue is so cheesy, even young adults should be insulted."
2,"Bad picture &sound, no colour, BARDOT still charms .","If you see a well shot and edited movie made 60 years ago chances are it will still look better than this one. The colour has somehow got lost on the DVD transfer, the sound is scratchy in places and murdered by bad dubbing (particularly with the little boy) and an intrusive musical score drowns out the dialogue. Having said that, although the plot is very thin, Bardot is a true professional and squeezes evrything she can out of her character. Its silly and not terribly funny either and probably not worth playing again for a very long time , but even with so much against it, the Star DOES shine through. She is a megastar and her screen presence can not be denied. If you're a fan buy it anyway. If your new to Brigitte's charms, get ""Une Parisienne"" , ""Come Dance with me"" and ""And God created woman"" before you even think of this one."
2,Lousy transfer of a Bardot Movie,"Well, I'm not going to go into the content of this movie - if you are reading this review you must be familiar with Bardot movies of this period and must know the quality of her work at this time. On the plus side, she looks absolutely gorgeous.....and that's about it. This DVD has to be the worst transfer of a movie to a DVD I have ever seen. It's in Black and White - full frame - dubbed terribly, and is rather grainy and unclear as well. Basically, I'm wishing that I had purchased the VHS edition which according to the other review of the item is at least in some kind of colour, albeit with a green tint to it. Avoid unless you are a completeist."
1,Rip Off.... watch ou!,"Stay as far away from this DVD release as you can. This is a 4x3 Black & White lousy copy of a beautiful 16x9 film from 1970. It has been released in glorious color in Europe, so why do we get this piece of junk?I think the answer is incompetent distributors that don't give a darn, and will do anything for a profit, even release this trashy DVD that was obviously recorded from analog television onto VHS tape. This product should be immediately pulled from distribution. I have sent a letter stating such to KOCH entertainment. No answer... I guess for these people there is no shame."
2,Another case of jaundice?,The bear and the doll was not unlike love on a pillow...colourwise that is..the yellowish tinge on this so called colour film warrants some explanation? What happened during the making of this video? That aside this is another dubbed version which always has the ability to make a movie sound really bad. Another frivolous attempt was made to capture bardot's seductive charm...this time at least she is doing the chasing!!!!great to add to my bardot collection but not something I'd be dying to watch again
3,"Oh well, at least Bardot is worth 3 stars","Cute film, lousy transfer.Hey, shouldn't this film be in color? After all, it was made in '69!"
5,"Extreme guitarism, technical and sublime","I'm more of a guitarista than a Zorn follower. The Zorn experts know far more than I do about how this album fits into his canon of work. But as far as guitar albums are concerned, this has to be one of the most sophisticated and sublime works I've ever heard.The recording method allows much of the process to bleed through, which places the listener in the room. This creates an intimacy that is rare for this level of playing.It's not what I would call a friendly album. Considering its theme, it shouldn't be. It's a challenging exploration of the sonic range of acoustic and electric guitars by three of the best instrumentalists to ever play this instrument."
4,Exquisite renderings,"Some of Zorn's most restrained, sincere work comes in the form of his Masada revisions via a few friends on guitar. Immediately, and throughout the sprawling compilation it is apparent just how spectacularly sensitive playing remains by three alternating guitarists, giving these usually brassed and jacked-up renditions a minimal, lingering sheen any instrumentalist would only wish to bask inside of. A must for classical guitar enthusiasts and seekers of technical talent everywhere."
3,Good but not Great...,"This is a good album but I don't find myself coming back for repeat listening like I do with the Masada quartet. All the guitarist are very good and interesting but the album lacks a coherence. Perhaps having all the Frisell songs together, then all the Ribot songs, etc. would've worked out a little better. The CD might also be improved upon with more guitar players in the mix. Ducret, Kaiser, Frith perhaps, etc. If you're into Masada - get it, if not, skip it."
1,Worst animated film *ever*,"While the story itself may have have had some coherence originally. That was quickly stripped away by this total waste of time and money.I would say that the animation looks like a couple of 9 year old kids found a program, but I know 9 year old kids that could do a much better job at both animation and character development. In reality it looks like Crest Animation was a startup that pulled folks off the street to work the buttons. I really can't express how truly horrible the animation is. For the technical minded, the animators knew nothing about slow-in/slow-out, overlapping, or idle movement.Character design and development are mostly non-existant, and given only cursory swipes here and there by the producers. Lionsgate, you should be ashamed of yourselves.If you still think that you should see this, that the trailer wasn't bad. Find the trailer online and watch it 30-40 times. You'll enjoy it more than attempting to sit through this bomb."
1,Dull Derivative Dross,"An insult to the intelligence and imagination of children everywhere.Hard to imagine grown men and women actually working on this er ""movie experience""."
1,NO STAR AT ALL DON'T ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!,First of all I ordered this Alpha and Omega Dvd/Blueray set for my kids Birthday thinking I would actually receive it! Well apparently they decided to cancel my order. Now I have to find it else where. Thanks a lot................really disappoints me.
4,Alpha and Omega from Amazon,My grandson absolutely loves this movie and has watched it over and over and over! I knew I could find it onAmazon.
3,"""Alpha & Omega""- A cartoon about wolves traveling across country and changing the order of the pack. Fun love story.I say B-, My","Cartoon about 2 wolves, an alpha (Panettiere) and an omega (Long),who get relocated to Idaho and there journey back home. Two wolves that are unable to ""be"" together get captured and relocated to another park halfway across the country. They set out for home with help from some very funny friends. Being a kids movie not much really to review, (except my kids really liked it). For the adults who watch this I really found it to be a metaphor for a class based system of the haves and have-nots. I may have read too much into it, but it makes a good point of love conquering all, no matter who or what you are. Deep enough? There were some really funny scenes in this but it is definitely a kids movie. Adults won't be totally bored, but don't expect ""Shrek"" type humor in this. I give it a B-, My kids give it an A."
3,Stream or Rent Instead,"I decided one evening with my son to check out my new Oppo's Blockbuster streaming service. We watched Alpha & Omega and I'm glad we did instead of blindly buying it. It really seems like Lionsgate is distributing this just so they can say they have an animation film in their library. The animation lacked Pixar or Dreamwork level of detail and an unoriginal plot. I suppose I really lost interest during the ""midnight howl"" sequence when the wolves stood on their hind legs and began dancing like Janet Jackson. Give it a rent or stream it for the kiddies and break out a mag or a netbook to occupy your time. You'll be glad you did."
2,A turkey in wolf's clothing.,"I just got done watching this with some friends/neighbors. There were 5 kids between 6 and 12, a late teen, and 6 adults. I think the only ones who enjoyed this movie in any way were the two youngest. The incredible number of previews generated multiple laughs compared to the turkey of a feature that followed. There is little story, no sense of danger, and very few laughs. There is a cool scene at the beginning with a roller coaster cam shot of wolves sledding downhill on a tree (yes, you read that correctly), but they do the same shot two more times in the movie and it loses its power. And the wolves ""howl""/sing in a way that is unpleasant/weird, which jars you out of scenes that would tolerable otherwise. I gave it more than 1 star because it is not offensive (a few butts, but that's it), some of the afore mentioned ""roller coaster cam"" shots are cool, and my 6 year old liked it OK. But there are much better movies out there."
2,"This story type has been made too many times. This movie was worse than ""Bolt""...","Just watch ""Bolt"" instead, it was far far better than this. Even my seven year old asked if it was free!"
3,ok,My kids liked it.and would watch it over AND over.and never get tyred of it .so watch it ok. Kids approved
4,"Great for kids, not so much for adults","I really couldn't tell you what's missing in this movie. The artistic quality was there, but the story was just lacking overall. Things didn't seem to blend well over the story line. Oh well, the kids loved it and that's all that matters."
3,Christmas gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son, and he loves it. As long as my son loves it then I love it."
5,Great movie,"The movie was great. They made a film that can entertain. This was enjoyable, can't wait to pre-order it."
1,Awful!,Adult-oriented and offensive humor combined with terrible animation. I was very surprised by the content and lack of a storyline.
5,alpha and omega,what a cute movie...purchased by adults and enjoyed very much. would recommend this movie to all families with and without children
4,"Actually, this is really good!","I was surprised that this movie was so good! We've watched it multiple times and it's really funny, well done, and sends a good message. The action scenes are fun and really keep the kiddos engaged! Definitely recommend!"
1,pretty lousy movie even for kids,"Please don't bother watching, you will regret it. Thought it might be fun for my four year olds, it wasn't."
1,"Weak animation by today's standard, aimed at 3D",We saw it with our kids. Apart from some nice howling scenes animation is sub-par in today's standards and the entire movie seems like a result of a conversation revolving around how to put stuff in the movie to look good in 3D.Kind of like the movie of a train going from side to side that my father told me he saw many decades ago when stereo sound was invented.Barely nice for 2010.
1,Are they humans in wolves clothing?,"Great animation requires at least good voice choice and creatures that take your imagination to fantasy that leaves you dreaming. This film was poorly voiced in that the actors chosen sounded more like humans acting like humans. The script and storyline sounded and looked like watching humans in wolves clothing. Just one example: a young female wolf is walking away with hips swaying back and forth and a young male wolf is ogling the view as only a human would understand.Storyline was weak with the predictable good wolves - bad wolves competing for territory; a journey by two young wolves from both packs; hinderance by humans and help by other animals until the denouement where, of course, everyone ends up friends after all.Animation/graphics were a decade old and nothing to remember; in part, I think, because they were subcontracted to some obscure studio."
1,inappropriate content,"Inappropriate content - violent comments such as ""I'll rip your throat out and....down your neck"" in addition to strong sexual suggestions - both clearly inappropriate for a PG rating. Story line is thrown together with no creativity - no cute and cuddly wolves shown here, more like a 'how-to' mate/fight with other wolves. Overall crap."
1,The worst movie,Seller was great and appreciate the prompt mailing. This movie is the worst kids movie and wasn't worth buying.
4,Not to shabby.,"Not to bad of a movie. I think the animation could of looked better. Story was ok to, buoy kids really enjoyed it, so 4 stars for keeping them entertained."
3,Ok,This is not the best animated movie but it is not bad I did enjoy the movie. Now people complain about dancing and singing wolves cmon guys rio has dancing birds so stop complaining. I really do feel that this movie could have been done better and it has potential but it does feel rushed. If they ever do a sequel they really need to animate the movie better and have a better plot but otherwise it was ok. I do love humphrey.
3,Keeps the kids entertained,This is not one of the best animated films that have come out in recent years but it has a decent storyline and the kids enjoy the animals.
1,Painfully contrived and Cheesy.,"This movie was so cheesy it hurt. From the ridiculous over done, over acted ballads- straight out of soft rock via 1985, to the snap your fingers it's all better abrupt ending. It had none of the fun, whit, and creativity that other kid flicks have like ""Despicable Me"" It was a bore. My kids lost interest quickly. I would rather watch Barney on loop for 90's minutes. It was that fake."
1,overcharged,never download but charged my card.....why dont they make it easy to fix problems....scam!!!!!!!seems like u have to complain to get responce
5,GREAT!!!,"Great movie! Imagine having your heart ripped out, run over and then put back togther agin. It makes you realizee how hope is all around. Love,action,drama and these are just of the words that describe what this movie is all about. Buy this movie you will not be sorry. Do not give up on your dreams one day it might just come true. The end might be might look bleek just keep going you will cry guranteed. The End."
4,Worth renting,"I rented this film for my 9 year old twins to watch while I attended a meeting at work. They really enjoyed the film and found it funny, thrilling and a good way to spend time at mommy's office. Thumbs up!"
2,ok but not great,"I got this move because I missed it in the theaters. I thought by the pre-views I had seen that it would be a very good movie.Once it got here and i watched it i was very disapointed. The story has great potential,but falls way short of it."
2,For very young children only,"Visually, this is a great movie, but the story line was goofy and there was some of the worst musical scenes I have ever seen in a movie. My kids and I love a great animated movie, but in their words, this movie was ""dumb."""
1,Just plain awful,this movie's plot was terrible and the acting even worse. definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. Will not be watching it again.
3,Cute movie,not bad if your into animated animal movies. Did a good job with animation and plot was cute with the animals
5,Large Stones at Bonneville,This pretty much follows the development and progress of one man and his car. Well worth seeing a mans dream unfold.
4,great turner with disappointing handle,"this turner is the best, especially in its left-handed version. unfortunately, the handle is not heat-safe, and careless use by my housemates has melted great lumpy chasms into the underside of the handle where it rested in the edge of a hot pan. really disappointing, considering how expensive this turner is."
5,O AND A AT ITS BEST,If you love Ope and Anthony you will love this CD. Best prank calls and some old school funny bits.One thing tho cd case in broken case but for $4 i didnt even bother.CD worked fine
1,Waste of Money,"This CD is poorly produced by two nuckle-head DJ's out of a low budget station in NY. It's content is just NOT FUNNY. It is just old material compiled from an obnoxious duo who it seems has never grown up. These Howard Stern wannabe's take humor to an all-time low, full of racist, anti-woman, anti-gay content. The editing is slip-shod, full of gaps and drivel. It is aimed at those with the IQ of 6-60. Don't waste your time or hard-earned money ."
2,Been done before,"I started listening to O+A when they where on that ""Boston"" station. They were very funny but everything they did was done before, and done better. Yes it is funnier than Adam Sandler but than again so is most of the people on the planet. But, funnier than Howard Stern....never."
1,Even more awful than the radio show!,"This CD is a prime example of what you get when you mix the worst of Stern with the ""best"" of the Grease Man.Like their radio show, this CD would benefit greatly if (1) Opie would quietly disappear from the scene, (2) Anthony would concentrate on performing his voice characterizations, and (3) The duo would refrain from doing their Jerky Boy phone bits and general banter, which cater to the least common ""Yo, Vinny!"" denominator."
1,I'd rather have root canal!,"If you like their reheated ""Greaseman"" bits from the WNEW radio show... if you like their inane chatter about professional wrestling and lactation... or if you are one of their pimply faced, adolescent Gen-X fans then this CD is for you. But if you have an IQ greater than mucus, avoid it like you would a staph infection. Anthony seems funny enough doing his impersonations, but what's the story with Opie? He has all the talent and presence of a modern day Ed McMahon.Trust me: Visit your dentist instead! The drilling is more entertaining...."
1,Worst Stern Impersonators Out There...,"This CD makes you wonder why you don't quit your job, buy Howard Stern's Crucified By The FCC and, like these two no-talents, get a job as a Stern impersonator. Not a single original bit or laugh on the entire CD. All I wish is that I could get back the hour I spent listening to this unfunny, unoriginal, unbelievably bad CD."
3,The Mentality of Many Americans,"Listening to the highly successful Opie and Anthony is at times humorous. More importantly it provides a porthole picture into the minds of many of today's white Americans.Often degrading to women, and nearly always extremely and blatantly racist, these two individuals have masterfully crafted a highly successful career out of behaving like 13 year olds and joking about the perceptions, fears and concerns that most White Americans publicly claim not to have. At the same time these two deceptively intelligent shock jocks point out the hypocrisies, problems and psychological pathology of the black community in order to justify the bigoted views that they espouse."
4,the hostile hospital,i tought that the book lacked the comidy as the others had.it is worth the time though.wich is about 3hours
4,book the 8th,"The Hostile Hospital is the 8th book in the A Series of Unfortunate Events.In this book we find out more about V.F.D and the Baudelaire family.It starts off with the orphans on the run after being falsely accused of a mudrer.Count Olaf is nowhere to be seen.What will happen find out by reading The Hostile Hospital,by Lemony Snicket."
4,summary for kids my age,this book is about the Baudelaires orphans that had disguised themselves as Volunteers for (Volunteers Fighting Disease)locate in the Heimlich Hospital. THey had to sing songs to comfort patients and give out heart-shaped ballons to the thirsty patients. After they had to go to the Library of Records to work and had search for a solution to their parents' death. Count Olaf's girlfriend found out Violet was there and had capture her. On and on Count Olaf escape to.....Read the next book!!!
5,The Hostile Hospital,"This book is mysterious. It is about three kids whos parents died in a fire and now a lot of unfortunet events has happend.Now there in a library of records in the hospital and someone is trying to capture them. Then two of the kids go down a shute and the oldest is captured.Then the bad guys are going to kill her. Then they get to the operating room. If you want to find out what happens next read The Hostile Hospital.I liked this book because it is mysterious.This book is also like the 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,and 12 seiries of Unfortunet Events."
3,kid's review,"Lemony Snicket's books have gone downhill since the second installment. The first 2 I found very original and enjoyed immensely, but the 3rd one was a great disappointement. It seems Lemony Snicket is trying to hard to imagine something more drastic to happen to the three orphans, yet every book appears to have the same basic storyline, with little new information on VFD being divulged, which means the storyline progresses at a very slow pace. The Hostile Hospital was one of the least good of his books due to its often tenacious writing and predictability.However, Lemony Snicket does continue to write in his amusing style and account the lives of the Baudelaire orphans in a way many people will not be able to stop reading until book number 13 is published."
5,Back with the Baudelaires,"When the Baudelaires are framed for murder, they think that a group of Volunteers Fighting Disease, a cheerful band of singing people who believe no news is good news and don't read the newspaper is a perfect place to find shelter. This might work for a normal person that is innocent of a horrible crime, but the Baudelaires are anything but ordinary. Count Olaf, or Mattathias, is after them again. Find out in book 8 about heart-shaped balloons, alphabet soup, an unnecessary surgery that puts Violet's life in danger, and page 13 of the Snicket File. LEMONY SNICKET IS AT IT AGAIN!"
5,"A wonderful book, the best!","Lemony Snicket has outdone himself again. Filled with woe and dispair and quite a few humorous parts Mr. Snicket produces yet another page-turner novel. The series is like one big chapter book each book being another installment in the big mystery he is devolping. Each book tells you some things but makes you want to read more because you have the feeling hes not telling you all of it. The Hostile Hospital is by far my favorite in the series so far. I can't wait for #9-The Carnivorus Carnival! Anyway I absolutely love them and reccomend the whole series to anyone who's sick of the ordinary ""happy ending"" or just wants to read some awesome books!"
3,The Hostile Hospital,"The Baudelaire orphans have escaped the town of VFD and we now find them trying to hide out in a hospital. Wanted for the murder of Count Olaf, the orphans are on the run and looking for information about the mysterious VFD.I found this book a bit more entertaining than previous ones. There was quite a bit of satire involving how hospitals are run. ""Paperwork is the most important thing we do in this hospital."" Although I don't have great things to say about these books, I keep reading them, and keep looking forward to the next. That in itself should say a lot!"
3,Hostile?,"I believe that this book The Hostile Hospital, is way different than the other books. I thought it was hard to read at some points because I was boerd. What made me so boerd was the fact that Klaus and Sunny were going to rescue Violet anyways from getting her head chopped off. I was also suprised that Lemony Snicket was a little more disgusting in this book. I reccomend this book if you are an advanced reader, like me I read about 2 pages in a minute."
3,Too repetitive,"I have read books 1-8, and it just keeps repeating the same things over and over. I want to read all of the series but I am finding myself getting quite bored."
5,Great for older readers!,i am 10 years old and really like this book!!!!!!!!It is a bit scarey for younger people because it sounds like someones going to have their head cut off!!!I think ages 9 1\2 to 18
5,Wow!,"Lemony Snicket has done it again, the eighth time! Snicket has class, spunk, suspense, and humor in his books. His style is so different I'd rather read this then Harry Potter! I highly reccomend for all ages!"
5,Help!-STOP-Count-STOP-Olaf-STOP-Still-STOP-Alive-STOP,"Yes, the story continues, the Baudelaires are fugitives and are on the run!This is the eigth installment to a terrible treacherous series of unfortunate events. Here the Baudelaiers are desperate to clear their name and bring Olaf to justice! Finding shelter will have to settle for now. The Baudelaires find a hospital in nowheresville and spend their short time there. They come across filing cabinets that may reveal all of the questions behind the secrets and lies they have come across. But before anything happens, guess what new ""doctor"" comes along and kidnaps Violet! After quick thinking and ABC soup, this tale ends in fire."
4,Series of Unfortunate Events the 8th Victoria's Review,"I think this book is good for people who like a tragedy story. You have no idea what is going to happen. It is a mystery/scary book about three orphan children. In this book they are still trying to escape Count Olaf, an evil villian. They always get thmeselves in more trouble but they are very smart and they end up getting out of those situations."
5,good book!,this series of books is next best books to Harry Potter. i don't like to read that much but when i read a good book i can't stop. Lemony Snicket writes this story about three orphans who are wanted for their fortune by an evil man Named Count Olaf. these books are great chapter books. and a great family story.
5,The Hostile Hospital,"Best one in the Baudelaires saga! The children are still running away. No help this time from Mr. Poe (as if there was some help ever). The kids grow up and mature. As in every other story, Sunny, Klaus and Violet show their special talents and their unity. Good news: Sunny is starting to talk a little. Olaf has a new accomplice: his girlfriend, Esmee, who is a fantastic villian. She is as bad as Olaf, if not worst. The ending is so exiting and suspensful that I can hardly wait for the next!"
2,Barbara's Review,"The book was ok. It wasn't as good as the others. There wasn't much action.Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are on the run from the police. They sneek on a V.F.D. vad and become volinteers at Heimlich Hospital. They get a job as Hal's helpers in the Library of Records. They have to file papers in one of the many file cabinets. Babs was taken by Count Olaf and he pretends to be the Head of Human Resorces. One day Esme comes to check on the Library. Klaus and Sunny through the mail shute. Does Violet get away?The type of person who would like this book is someone who has read any others in the series."
3,Worst,"I didn't like this book. Everyone was interested in the Quagmires but he didn't even mention them in this book. All of a sudden they're chasing after the Snicket file. I'm not interested!Other than that it was a great book. I loved the part about Laura V. Bleediote's head almost being chopped off, even though it was VERY gruesome."
5,Lemony Pulls off Another Yarn of Misery,"Snicket has done it again! He has created another tale of suspense, evil, and woe.the Baudelaires have ended up at theHeimlich Hospital, where, as expected,Olaf and his troupe are in hiding, readyto get the fortune in their evil clutches.I reccomend this book to anyone, and it will leave you yearning only for the next oneto come out."
4,Fantastic,It was very good Iove Lemony Snickets books there fantastic .I can not wait to get the next one :D
2,Cody's review,"I didn't really like the book The Hostile Hospital by Lemony Snicket. The reason I didn't really like this book is because it was boring all through the story till the end. I think the 7th book is the best so far.In the beginning they run away to a store. They get a ride from the V.F.D to the hospital. Klaus, Sunny, and Violet get jobs as file cabinet organizers. They find out that one of their parents is still alive. The Count Olaf tries to cut off Violet's head. After a while Count Olaf puts the hospital on fire and all three of them escape.I think that people who like boring stories to the end. Then they will like this book."
2,Cleaver Idea,"While this book would be great for a younger audience, to read it as an adult it wasn't nearly as entertaining. I do like some young adult/children's literature (such as the Harry Potter books and Phillip Pulman's books) but this one was a disappointment to me."
2,"ok, horrible at times",This book is horrible. All of the other books are good but this one is just to simple and boring.
2,meh gettin boring,the people out there that like happy books dont read this... there's even a disclaimer on the book about it. anyways its pretty good...fer kids maybe up to 14 cause they're pretty short a good short read. http://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1719175 is a good page to check fer more books like these
5,Two Difficult and Selfish Husbands,Marcia Muller is adept at describing relationships. In this book we meet at least two difficult and selfish husbands whose wives are coming apart with drugs or anger. THERE'S SOMETHING IN A SUNDAY is one of the better entries in the Sharon McCone series.
5,There's Something in a Sunday,Marcia Muller has always been one of my favorite writers. You can't go wrong reading one of her books and this one is no exception. The characters are fully realized and interesting.
4,"Beautiful words, beautiful drawings","""Spirit of the Siskiyous"" is a rare, precious book by a woman with a keen sense of observation and perception. Not only can she translate her knowledge and insights in words, but she can also enhance her writing with drawings and watercolors that visually capture the often profound subtilities of flowers, seasons, bugs and birds. The book is one to be read slowly so that it can be enjoyed graciously. It's a small gem, one that will delight and enlighten its readers."
5,"Well Spoken, Fun Read, No BS","When I got my new horse, several people recommended this book as the best of breed 'manual' for all things equestrian. I took their recommendation and was surprised by how much I enjoyed learning how to love my horse. This book is straight up fact and information without being overly-verbose. Also the the author's fun spunky approach kept the content fresh and inspired me to read it cover to cover in less than a week. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you!"
1,Beware this is an awful cleaner with detergent.,"Yes beware that this is a detergent and not a floor to floor cleaner as advertised. This will leave a dull film on your floors. When we tried to return the product they wanted us to pay another shipping to them, plus a restocking fee plus a portion of our purchase price. We have never had such an awful encounter with an Amazon product sold. The picture on Amazon is in the old white bottle which we wanted, so ordered it. this is the stuff that arrived. Do not buy. Plus it is $8.00 more for this item than what you can buy at any Home Depot store. As you can see, wee are totally disappointed in the product and the seller."
1,GOOD AT PRODUCING A SORE THROAT,THE HOOVER CLEANER GAVE 2 OF MY 3 FAMILY MEMBERS A SOAR THROAT AND ALLERGIC SKIN REACTIONS SIMPLY FROM CONTACT WITH THE VAPORS IN THE AIR. WE TRIED USING AMMONIA AND FOUND THAT TO BE MUCH BETTER.
3,Missing My Favorite Poem,"I bought a 1921 Bobs-Merrill illustrated edition of this work decades ago. While this Kindle Edition has a good sampling, it does not have all the poems in my edition. One that is missing is a rather long poem called ""Tradin' Joe"" that has been a personal favorite since I bought the book. Those that are present are faithfullly reproduced. This Kindle edition is also without illustrations."
5,An excellent resource of hardscape elements for the garden!,"As a landscape architect, I find this book is an excellent resource for hardscape ideas for the garden. The book is divided into the basics planes of the garden ... floors, boundaries & dividers, overhead structures, etc. The wonderful photographics are invaluable as well as the discriptions telling the history, uses and construction of the site elements. I would recommend this book to professionals and weekend gardeners for its inspiration and knowledge."
5,Great!!,"Lew is playing great as always, with a rich and lively tone,he got a tons of colors in his horn....nice. But this is the exact same cd as Speak Low"
1,"Poorly organized, utterly useless","First, this book is very poorly organized. I bought it with a hope that it would at least discuss a few things about web services, but it only devoted a few pages to each of the WS-Standards. The entire rest of the book was case studies and examples, which were all very poorly documented. I will say one thing in favor of this book, all of the code samples had LINE NUMBERS! Who would have thought of a great idea like that! I certainly hope other publishers start using line numbers to reference code samples, but I didn't buy this book for a bunch of line numbers. I bought it to UNDERSTAND the WS-Specifications, which this book did nothing at all to help with."
1,This was the most useless book I've seen from MSPress,"The book offers not more information that can be found on MSDN but formatted much much worse than the MSDN content. There are very few specifics and virtually no detail. The code and XML snippets are hardly described. This material qualified for a magazine article at most, and not for a professional book."
3,Unsure,"I was so glad to get to read this book because I have very much enjoyed her previous books, especially the ""Test"" ones set in the Middle Ages, however this one just did not ""do it"" for me!I had a hard time finishing it, never really cared for the characters, and found the plot way too melodramatic and impractical for my taste. It had lots of action and seemed to be trying to imitate ""Romancing the Stone"" and other similar movies. (Caveat: Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when reading this novel.)This novel had it's cute and funny moments which I enjoyed. You may like it as it is definitely an ""escape from reality"" romance novel.FYI: There are some really cool photos on the author's website that show locations and inspirations for scenes used in the novel - they're great! Check them out."
3,Not her best...,"Cordela was okay, but the story had WAY too much filler. I found it a bit boring, which was an amazing thing since this was also an action story."
2,not her best,Not her best writing. Very hard to get to the end of the book. I almost quit reading her books.
2,Is this a romance?,"I loved Krahn's ""Test"" books. They were hilarious, fun, satisfying romances. With ""The Book of True Desires"" (and even her last book, ""The Book of Seven Delights"") she is venturing too far into the Raiders of the Lost Ark territory. Are these screenplays for adventure movies? That's not what I want when I pick up a romance novel. There is certainly action here, but I feel cheated. Her heroine is gorgeous, confident, and accomplished, right from the get-go. Sadly, I didn't relate to her at all. Krahn's earlier heroines were so much more appealing. They all felt lacking in some way, all searching for ""home"", none feeling too terribly beautiful. I hope that in the future Krahn creates more of those endearing characters. These just turned me off. Crazy, twist-and-turn-type plots can only carry a writer so far. I want my romance novels to center around the romance. This one didn't."
4,Solid 60's rock,"This is enjoyable music and is a good example of mid 60's rock. There are numerous covers here from Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Bo Diddley, The Kinks, etc. so I can't say this was the epitome of originality but it's all very well played and has a good energy level with good sound quality. If you are into mid 60's rock before the songs extended over 6 minutes and the guitar solos took over, this will probably be enjoyable to you. Good stuff."
4,Remains - 'A Session With The Remains' (Sundazed) 4 1/2 stars,"To avoid any confusion, 'Session With The Remains' isn't their second album. They only released one lp, their self-titled record. This CD is a 'lost-in-the-vault' audition that (is supposed) to be of better sound quality than that French import title put on the New Rose label. I've heard both pressings, as I can barely tell the difference. Keep in mind that import is likely harder to find than hen's teeth. Tunes here I thought made the grade were their covers - like Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"", their toe-tapping version of Bo Diddley's ""I'm A Man"" and the demos and studio rehearsals of Remains originals - ""Ain't That Her"", the heart-felt ""Why Do I Cry"", ""Say You're Sorry"" and ""All Good Things"". Deserves a treasured place in your hallowed music collection. A good pick. Long live garage rock & roll."
1,A constant problem with fogging.,"I purchased this mask based on many positive reviews. Unfortunately, it fogged my glasses immediately and I was not able to eliminate the fog. I have used other brands with no fogging at all."
5,Used as protection against dust in humid climate,The respirator valve helped me breathe easily with this mask without getting all fogged up. I also gave one to a friend who had a sinus infection on a plane as a protective measure to minimize his effect on others.
5,"Kind of pricey at the big box stores, but totally worth it....","The little air valve thing really works. I've been working in the crawl space with this, and the outside is nearly black from all the crap it filters after a day of work. So it is doing it's job, but the great thing is that unlike the cheaper filters, I'm not breathing in warm air that I just exhaled. Heck, when I got out of the crawl space, my dog wanted to play frisbee, so I ended up running around with the mask on and it didn't bother me. So like I said...the little air vale thing really works. It could be a little more comfortable, but the straps are also solid (thin waistband material....not cheap elastic). Was kind of annoyed at the price when I bought them, but after using them I'd gladly pay more. Amazon's price is great on this one as well."
4,Comfortable and effective,"Exactly what I needed, a comfortable good fitting mask. It works great and is easy to use. Terrific."
2,Worst Gas Mask Ever,"I bought the 3M 8511 Particulate Sanding Respirator to use while working. I own a medium-sized Pest Control Business, and needed a gas mask in order to enter an otherwise-toxic, sealed house during treatment with poison gas. This did not work, at all. After I entered the house I'd filled with ammonia and cyanide gas, by the time I'd finished zipping closed the seal to the house I was already gagging. After I woke back up, I crawled to the exit and had to leave, without getting any work done. Also, this gas mask caused me headache, nausea and vomiting.Pros: Cheap. Good for sanding.Cons: Terrible Gas Mask. Did not adequately protect me from poisonous gas, radiation, or gunshots."
5,Excellent quality,"We use these masks in our drywall business. They are excellent. They work great, comfortable and the price is very good."
5,Excellent product,"3M 8511 Particulate Sanding Respirator N95 with Valve, 10-PackThe primary reason for switching to this type of respirator was to prevent the fogging up of my sunglasses which constantly happened when I used the cheap respirators. I used this 8511 respirator for the first time this season while trimming the multiple bushes and hedges in our yard. I am pleased to note that it completely prevented the breathing in of spores which always caused lengthy coughing spells in previous years. It also is effective when I spread mulch. That also created long term asthma type breathing spells later on."
1,No expiration date on the box,"I cannot find the expiration date from the box. I contacted an representative at Amazon, she cannot find it either. I don't feel comfortable if a product doesn't specify the expiration date, so I return it."
1,To tight,Unless you have child's size head do not buy this. It is extremely tight on my face. No way to loosen it either.
5,Great mask,This is the best mask out there. Does not fog up my glasses and filters very well!I use it for dusty yard work and in my wood shop. Having the exhaust valve makes it much easier to breatheand helps keep the glasses clear.
5,An excellent basic respirator,"This respirator is better because of the one-way ventilation valve in the front, which keeps your exhalations from coming out and fogging up your glasses. Also, the elastic is much more durable than the really cheap masks."
4,3M 8511,"This respirator did a good job of reducing construction dust (tear-out, sawing, etc.). It didn't fog up my safety glasses like similar products and I didn't get dust in my nose and throat."
3,3M #8511 dust mask,"I make a lot of dust in my woodworking shop and am careful to ALWAYS wear a dust mask. Once you develop a wood allergy, it never goes away so I am very careful to use this mask.First, if you are going to wear a mask all the time, it has to be comfortable. The #8511 is soft and with the adjustable nose-fit feature, it conforms snugly to the contours of my face. The two elastic straps provide snug but not over-tight contact and, with a little care, I get a close enough fit so that my exhalations do not fog up my safety glasses. The masks are durable and I typically can wear one all day, every day for several weeks (as long as I don't sneeze while wearing it!).The masks appear to effectively remove even fine sanding dust as the inside remains clean and I have developed no allergies after many years of usage.Thanks for another fine product 3M!ROD"
4,Great mask,This is a great mask for cleaning and other household chores. I've used this mask in dusty environments. It was also useful when my neighbors were remodeling their house and the dust was coming into our house. These masks are also good for wildfire ash. The valve makes this mask much easier to breathe through. The metal band for the nose is very sturdy. The only problem I had was that the mask was a little large for my face.
4,SoCal wildfire protection,"I bought this 10 pack to get ready for the next wildfire season in San Diego. The box got split up for my extended family to have ready. The smoke in the air is terrible during those few days a year when we are faced with burning all around us. It's good to know we have them ready at hand.I love the ease of use, especially the nose piece that can be pressed to confirm to your face. It is very comfortable and hightly recommended."
5,Good Replacement for Moldex Respirators,"I thought I'd give these a try after finally getting fed up with some equivalent respirators by Moldex. After going through two boxes of 10 each of the Moldex, I found that the straps broke on at least half of them the first time I put them on (""medium/large"" size). These 3M units have a type of strap that I've found to be very strong in the past and I don't anticipate a breakage problem.I use these for yard work and they seem to be very effective against pollen and dust. I'd prefer to have the surface that fits against the face to be as smooth as the Moldex ones, but these will do just fine, as long as the straps don't break.By the way, I tried sending Moldex feedback about this problem after my experience with the first box of 10; sent them an email, never heard a word back from them and the problem never did seem to get fixed. Hard to believe they are an ISO9001 company."
4,Great item except..,Since I do a lot of woodwork sanding I needed something better than the cheap dust masks. This does a great job at the expense of being snug on the head. Would not want to wear this more than 1-2 hours at a time.
5,3M Respirator,My recent Amazon purchase of 3M 8511 Particulate Sanding respirators went as well as I could expect. The product does a good job of protecting me from the sanding dust I generate while making wood projects in my own shop. They fit tight but are comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. I would rate them very high.
4,Good sanding masks,I'm a woodworker and use these masks in my shop. They are comfortable and don't fog up my glasses. The price is much better than buying them individually at the big box stores.
5,"Comfortable, effective respirator","I use these mostly for woodworking, mainly while sanding, but also while sweeping or blowing out the garage. The valve is a big upgrade from the old valveless respirators as it provides a way to exhale without fogging your glasses. The fit is good. The respirator is easy to put on and take off; elastic bands keep it on tightly without being overly tight, at least on me; I have not had any problem getting a good fit or seal.The part over the bridge of the nose does interfere with my glasses resting where they should, but I haven't yet found a respirator that doesn't.These are highly recommended for dusty tasks like sanding, cleaning, etc."
1,Unsatisfactory costume material,"The silver material the Ninja Cyclone Child Halloween Costume is made of caused my grandson to itch very badly. He cannot and will not wear the costume again because of this problem. The very first time he had it on he started itching very badly and we had to give him Benadryl, shower and wash him off before he was comfortable again."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Just like the other books in this series, I read through this in a very short period of time (several hours total over a couple days). Great book and a must read if you're reading the series!"
5,very well explained,I started this series in chronological order instead of publication order and so far THIS book has been such a great read. It helped me learn a better way to explain salvation and the rapture to others. GREAT book
5,spiritually uplifting,This book was excellent. Take out time to read the entire series it comes from. EXCELLENT.
2,disappointment,"I GOT THIS TO COMPLETE THE LEFTBEHIND SERIES. THIS BOOK ISN'T QUITE AS GOOD AS ALL THE REST, ABIT OF A LET DOWN. IT'S TOO ROSY, TOO MADEUP, WHERE THE OTHERS ALL HAD QUITE A BIT OF THRUTH IN THEM. I FEEL LIKE IT WAS A WASTE OF $$!. JMILLER"
3,The Better One of the Prequels,"This is definitely the best one of the prequels. I'm not going to write a plot summary because Amazon and other reviewers provide that. I guess I don't understand why these books weren't put all together and included in the series. I love the parts about the Rapture and what happens after to the people that are Rapture. I didn't enjoy that it didn't really have anything to do with Nicolae in the last part of the book. I got tired of the others in their after the Rapture events. We already knew what Buck, Chloe and Raymond did. Just wish these would have been put into one book."
2,Dissapointed,"The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out. I prefer the unabridged versions."
5,What will it be like in heaven?,"This book answered that question for me. I know that the writers of this book or anyone else on earth does not truly know what heaven will be like, but they did an amazing job of illustrating what heaven might be like. I have read the whole Left Behind Series and I have to say that The Rapture was one of my favorites. The imagery in this book gave me such an excitement of what it will be like the day the Jesus returns for his children. I absolutely loved this book and the Left Behind Series. I am not an Eglish major or anything close to it and I know some people may complain about plots, and charcter development, and all this and that, but if you are a Christian and want to read a great series, then Left Behind is for you. I also recommend this book to non-Christians who have any interest at all in Jesus Christ and his return."
2,Why make such a bad book,"Alright, I am a big fan of the Left Behind Series but the prequels do not compare at all to the original series. The third installment was the worst of the three being used to push a certain religious belief. Personally I felt it was veyr preachy and did not emphasize on the story. The book went no where, it was dry and boring and i didnt even watn to finish it but forced myself to. It picked up towards the last 30-50 pages but thats about it. If anyone is to read the prequels, the first book was the best and half of the second book was alright. But sorry to say the third was a huge dissappointment. The authos were just using the book as a tool to spread their owns beliefs. But im not bashing the Left Behind Series because it was an excellent read of suspent and thrill which was not at all present in the Rapture."
4,Good Read,"I didn't think that I would get into this book the way I had others in the series but it did capture me. It also gave an understanding of the charactes who had already ""left"" in the first book of the series. There were some parts that seemed unnecessarily long."
3,Not as good of condition as advertised,"This book was listed as ""like new,"" but it was far from it. It had a chewed up corner as if a dog had worked it over. It was still readable, though. It did arrive on time. Of the 16 used books I ordered via Amazon, this one was by far in the worst condition."
3,Not a Believer,"I found it very interesting and informative where the Bible is concerned. Like I indicated, I am not a believer in the Rapture. I do believe in Christ, but as a truly remarkable figure in history. I believe he is the son of God just like we all are God's children. LaHaye is telling us that the Bible is the word of God, but man wrote it and than translated it. The Council of Churches decided what books to put in it and who knows what else they changed because they thought it was for the good of mankind. Also, if I want to talk to God I don't need to do it through Christ. I just do it. Maybe I'm wrong, it won't be the first time, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. If I end up going through trbulation, then that's my karma. I enjoyed it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's sciene fiction. I enjoyed it as such."
1,Poor Movie Format,Movie is formated such that it's less than TV resolution. This is the second movie I've rented on Amazon like this. Amazon needs to step up and tell us what the format is. I'm going to be very reluctant about renting another video from Amazon if they can't be forcoming on the format.
3,"Lustful, yet artistic with clever use of mistery.","I was searching some video about the actual countess Bathory. This was the closest I could find in Amazon. I may say it was not what I expected, but putting aside my search, this is what I found: A very lustful story, about a modern countess Bathory. Please don't relate the original with the movie, it won't work. Still, the movie is quite good. The story is very straightforward, though very clever points of mistery add some good ingredients for the movie. Lustful without becoming porn. Very artistic scenes on lesbianism, sado-masoquist relations, etc. The actress performing countess Bathory is a good excuse for the whole movie. Worth to see it."
2,eternal,"The movie wasn't bad, it was actually pretty good. The only problem for me was that for some reason the way the disk was formated made the movie very un-enjoyable to watch. The resolution was bad, and it frequently would pause during a scene, which happend through-out the whole movie."
4,Personal Favorite,"I was a pre-teen when I got this album. The music just stirs me in a way I can't really describe. The tracks of ""Heroes"" and ""Turn the Page"" are deeply thoughtful and are two of my very favorite songs. I enjoy this album a lot since I can sing along with it...(when no one's listening at least). There's just a real passion in this music that I still love to this day."
5,"Great transaction, great product!",Super fast shipment and great product! Would definitely recommend using again. Thank you for such a quick and easy transaction. Cute product too!
5,very nice,"nice quality material for these little scrubs; child especially liked dressing up like family medical member. Runs small, but our child was age 3 although extremly petite and it fix beautifully. Note on size:...3T not for normal 3 year old, this particular item would be too small."
4,Tie a Yellow Ribbon,Now have a CD with the greatest hits to play. Enjoy most of the tracks on the CD & know most.
5,"WONDERFUL, AWESOME","Delilah, a radio show host, gives us encouragement and inspiration as she tells us things that have happened in her life; plus, she shares stories of some of her listeners and friends.I admire Delilah, as a woman who believes in and loves God, as her example as a mother, and as what she appears to be as a person.Delilah hasn't always had it easy, but yet she appears to be a dynamic person. This book is wonderful. If you are going through or have gone through a rough time, either physically or emotionally or both, this book will encourage and inspire you. And if everything is going good for you, this book is also for you. This book is awesome and wonderful."
5,hope,This book gave me so much hope in a time of desperation for my family. It was an excellent reminder that I am not crazy to keep on hoping and believing. I want to thank Delilah for her superb contribution to the enrichment of so many lives and to the sanity of mine!
1,They break off,I bought one of these for each of my two bathrooms.They both broke off in the same place. The compression collar that connects cradle for the showerhead to the swivel ball cracked in half. Either the collar is not strong enough or the plastic is defective and stresses out from expansion from the hot water.In my opinion they were a total waste of money.
2,Acceptable for now,"This hand held shower head was very easy to install and the setting worked wonderfully. I especially liked the misting setting. After a few uses, I noticed that the heavy head did not sit sturdily on the holder and would occasionally fall off. In addition when moving the handle to suit each user the fixture would loosen from the shower nozzle and would have to be tightened. We still use it, but will be looking for a replacement in the near future. For now it seems a shame to discard even though it was purchased at a bargain price."
2,"longest shower ever, takes forever to rinse","You get what you pay for. The amount of water that this puts out is not enough to wash your hair or soap off your body without a great deal of extra time. Might as well have used the sink. The circumference of the spray, not to mention the force, is just pitiful."
4,Almost everything I had hoped. A great product.,"I love this showerhead. I owned a VERY expensive mounted one with 6 settings, but I really wanted a handheld one. I was worried about the quality of the water pressure. I was really in love with the ""mist"" setting on my other shower which is the best mode ever. I was searching for a handheld one with the same mode and this one had it. It was just as great as the moutable one. I love it when it is resting in it's mounted setting because it hangs directly above my head. It does not move that much on the setting, but you can always take it down anyways. The only thing I didn't like that much was that the cord was barely long enough to hold it while laying in the bathtub. Not long enough to rinse hair while sitting."
3,Cheap price,Very cheap price with an adequate performance. If it lasts for a year or so it`ll really be a bargain.
4,serves its purpose,no complaints. like the option of a steady handsfree stream and a handheld in one. The 4 settings are ok but the misting one is pointless and is like being at a carwash with the fine mist. its messy!
3,Okay!!,"This handheld shower is okay....the different settings are great...But one problem i have with it, is the changing of temperature to hot and cold, Which sucks, because i'm not able to enjoy it!!"
1,A worthless piece of junk,"At $11.77 and free shipping, this shower head was dirt cheap, but it is not worth even one cent of that price. The shower head will not stay put in the swivel bracket, and the swivel bracket in turn has cheap, miniature, plastic threads that will not hold the bracket onto the standpipe that comes out of your shower wall. The manufacturer offered to replace the entire shower head for free, and no doubt Amazon would do the same, but you have to send the bad one back in either case, and it would cost almost as much to do that as it's worth. I determined that it was cheaper and less trouble to just take it back out of the shower and throw it in the trash, which is what I did."
3,Pollenex DM209X handheld shower head,"Except for being plastic and needing to be replaced once a year, I really like this product. On the first showerhead needing to be replaced, the plastic split where the hose connects to the shower head. With the one I have to replace now, the plastic split where the hose connects to the water supply. Hopefully, I can find something made out of metal."
1,DON'T GET BURNED LIKE I DID,THIS PIECE OF JUNK LASTED ME FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN IT DEVELOPED CRACKS AND LEAKS UP WERE YOU CONNECT IT TO THE SHOWER PIPE. THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX CHEAP PLASTIC THAT STARTS TO CRACK. I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE AND BOTH DEVELOPED THE SAME PROBLEMS. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU BUY CHEAP STUFF YOU GET BURNED. DON'T TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS ONE.
1,i dont remicomend it,my ant got one of thoes back in 2008 and the outher day she had to replace it she says it broke of the pipe and was unfixubel to me it dozent look like it is a good shower head the spray settings are spray or streem of mist NOT shower like outher shower headsme on the outher hand i am goingto look into bying this shower head just to try it
4,It works but....,"Since using this product I have lost about 8 pounds in about a month. But of course the formula is to attempt to eat healthy, I exercise at least 3 times a week, and all that routine. I haven't had any side effects and I feel comfortable taking this product."
2,Too much speed,"I felt the product gave me too much of a buzz including causing difficulty concetrating and made me short tempered. It also increased heart rate. I won't use it. It might be OK for others but if you try it please start with only one capsule for a few days and see how you feel. If you have any heart problems, STAY AWAY!"
3,Results? not yet...,"I've used this suppliment for almost a month.... I don't see any difference even though I'm working out at least 4 times a week. But just a reminder to everyone who is not use to drinking too much coffee, soda, tea, and energy drink. this product has a lot of caffine. When I first took the pills I was running around crazy because I had too much energy I suppose~ If you are not use to taking caffine like me reconsider before you buy this product."
4,Extra energy without the jitters,"Maybe I'm a little more ""immune"" to some of the jittery problems of which some have complained. I have been using this in conjunction with Bally's vitamins for women, and I'm quite happy with both products. I find that the Fat Burning Complex gives a little boost of energy, but I don't feel as though I'm jumping out of my skin. I give it four-out-of-five, as I feel the energy boost could be a little more. As another reviewer said: This is no miracle pill. There is no such thing!!! This is just a small boost. A well-rounded diet with regular exercise is really the key. It's been said for years for a reason: THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE!!"
4,Will help with definition and energy.,I am on my third bottle of Ballys fat burning complex. I have noticed increased definition. Mostly on my arms and legs. Part of the reason is the increased energy I get from the 100 mg of caffeine. I can complete two complete sets where I normally did 1 1/2 sets. I also sweat alot more.The only draw back I noticed is increased acne. My heart also beats more rapidly. I'm not sure if its because Im working harder or the fat burning complex. I have also maintained the same weight. Hope this helps.
2,Eh,"Not very motivating...Jillian Michaels videoes are just as challenging and easier to get thru. The ""cut and paste"" layout makes it feel longer than it is."
4,great product but could be better,"My dad loves this device. He's 94 and often prefers this over his hearing aid. I do wonder why they provided a stereo headphone with a mono output, as the headphone was therefore only functional on one side. Easy enough to replace with a mono earbud. Seems like it should be set up so if you put a stereo headphone in it sends a signal to both ears. Also a bluetooth model would be great...no wires just a hearing aid size earpiece.All in all a handy device and made nicely."
3,Disappointed,"The recipes might be good....haven't tried them yet. I bought this book for my son as a Christmas present because he likes to cook & loves gumbo. But the only picture is on the cover...that was disappointing. I think everyone wants to see how a recipe should end up looking when the dish is prepared, but without pictures this book doesn't give you a clue."
3,Can only write at 4x,"I had quite an opposite experience with some other users. I was not able to burn with these disks at 2x with a SONY DRU510 (max burning speed 2x), however it burns fine on a DRU800 at 4x (max burning speed 4x).Bottom line, I get a lukewarm feeling of safety with these disks."
1,The rumors are true.,I had ordered the RiData DVD-RW's before I read all the negative feedback about the DVDs being defective. It is true. I had no luck with these disks at all. Sending them back for a refund. Save your time and get another brand.
1,Would not work in any of my Mac computers,"I bought these discs so that I could record TV shows on my Samsung DVD recorder and play them while traveling, on my iBook 14"". Unfortunately these discs aren't recognized on my iBook, nor my G4 Quicksilver desktop machine with a Pioneer DV$-104 drive, nor on my Compaq notebook. So basically these discs are of little value to me. They will only record and play in my home DVD players...not on my Macs. Macintosh users beware."
3,Some Davidson fans might be disappointed...,"I've read just about everything of MaryJanice Davidson's that I could get my hands on, the past year or so. I like her snappy dialogue and her great characters. I picked up Secrets vol 6 solely because of a Davidson story.I just wanted to warn other Davidson fans that this story is a lot darker than most of her stories, and includes a very disturbing scene of forced sex. I like werewolf stories, in general, and I really liked ""Derik's Bane,"" the third in the series (just out as a full-length novel), but I found this one disturbing. I found little about the hero to like (he was a little too alpha) and had a difficult time believing the heroine would develop any softer feelings for him.If you're a fan of the sensual type story, then this is probably a good anthology for you, as other reviews attest. But if you're a Davidson fan looking for something like ""Royal Treatment"" or the ""Undead"" books, you may want to approach this volume with some caution."
2,too much and too little,"too much sex and too little story; insufficient interaction between the characters to yield good story lines, it would have been so much better without the excessive inclusion of hot and heavy sex."
2,...,"Flint's Fuse - I loved Flint, he was the perfect character, except he stupidly falls for a typical spoiled, blond, manipulating slut. I hated her immediately. 2 stars. I gave an extra one for the sexy dialogue Flint uses during intimate scenes.Love's Prisoner - The beginning was funny, very realistic female character. Until she starts getting really bitchy. I loved Michael though. Also, the whole ""rapist"" thing destroyed the mood. 1.5 stars.The Education of Miss Felicity Wells - This story was my favorite, as I love regencies, and this was written so erotically. I loved both characters so much, and was cheering for them at the end. 4 stars. I took off a star because there were some inaccuracies with the setting.A Candidate for the Kiss - First of all, I think I'm getting sick of Angela Knight. The plot here was stupid, the main character Dana was an idiot, in fact, I'd swear she was the other Dana's twin sister, from Flint's Fuse. Typical platinum blond brat. 1 star.Not my favorite Secrets book."
1,Not quite,"I wanted to like secrets, but I didn't. I thought the writing and love scenes were extremely unimaginative and boring. The characters were not very endearing, and the dialogue was flat. For a shining example of what a short, erotic story can be check out Robin Schone's "" A Lady's Pleasure."" It is lightyears ahead of Secrets in both sensuality and character developement.I would not buy another Secrets after having read this one."
1,"Poor content, poor technique ...","I'm sorry but I don't recommend this product to anyone.Pros: NONECons:-Poor content and poor presentation, you can't understand what are the basic strokes and what are the basic rhythms clearly. Rolls, slaps, muted strokes are not covered.-Sometimes explanations are very boring.-The instructor seems very uncomfortable.-Long performances, this has to be an instruction material not a performance record.-Poor technique, the instructor's hands are a bit clumsy."
1,Playing Doumbek,"He is good, I guess I am not! I can play but he was unable to teach me much more. I think the teaching method could have been better. Just didn't seem to have the communication in this tape that the EMedia series for guitar has when teaching. If you don't know anything and are desparate to learn then it has something but your not going to get a lot out of this one."
4,informal economics,"I enjoyed learning about the many ways Jews in early Palestine and in the Diaspora have made their living, as I'm always interested in the life-ways of earlier times. This book is a first attempt at bringing together scattered information, and so is not a finished presentation. There were actually several dozen occupations a Jew could have, even in the restrictions of medieval and renaissance Europe -- not restricted only to tax collecting and money lending."
4,My son seemed to be happy when he got this as a gift,"Seems like the perfect gift for a 12 year old boy. Much better than video games since at least, there appears to be some math and strategy involved with this card game."
2,not feet-friendly,"these shoes hurt my feet a lot, i thought with the price i put in them they'd be comfortable. they do look good, like in picture, but they are just not feet-friendly, though i have thin feet."
2,Super Narrow,"This shoes is simple and classic, but it's way too narrow. I am usually a size 4.5 or 5M and I ordered the 4.5W knowing that my feet could use wide shoes, but when i got it, the length fits perfectly, but it's very narrow. I can't imagine how the normal width would be if the Wide is so narrow. Unfortunately, I had to return them. they do look pretty tho."
3,They are hard and run narrow/small,"These shoes were ok looking. The buckle is golden, and the material is not the best. The leather is very flat/dull looking, and it is hard. This brand tends to be all over the place when it comes to sizes. I own the Rosa heels in Medium width, and they are slightly wide, and I have wide feet for my shoe size. So I was expecting these to fit, but the front of the shoe is quite narrow, so my toes were squeezing in them when I tried them on. As the material felt hard, I thought it would take several sessions of pain to break them in, so I returned them. If you have wide feet, order a half size or one size above your street size, or order the wide widht ones. They are not pretty anyway with the leather being so dull looking."
5,Great shoes!,"I just started ballroom dancing and these have been ultra helpful! They are comfortable, functional, and pretty. I love them!"
5,The Most Important book on Skateing you shall ever read!,"This is the story of Rodney Mullen, the most important street/freestyle skater ever. In this book you read about his life, from his birth, to first skateboard, to winning the world championship in freestyle. You will also read about how he started four of the most known skate companies ever; Enjoi, Almost, World Industries, and Tensor Truck co.. Included in this book is his story of growing up with a father that made his children give up there favorite pass times to pursue the fathers dreams of growing up succesfully. This is, no doubt, the most important book on skaeting ever; From Rodney Mullen inveting the flat ground ollie (or just ollie) to making the 'magic flip' (kickflip) to then creating of 30 of todays most popular tricks."
3,Cute story,"Cute story of authors history of skateboarding, why he and others like me love it. How it changes our outlook on our word of concrete, ourselves and how skateboarding can and will change a lot of peoples lives. More than a sport, it's a borderline obsession. Decent book."
5,"Great book, must read!","Wow! What an amazing story. I wasn't able to put it down. If you have a passion for skating in any form, then I can't say enough great things about this book.Rodney Mullen did more for skateboarding that I ever realized. This is one of the best book's I've ever read!"
2,"outdated, not much use","I am also a software developer and trying to find books on legal issues related to software development contracts. when I purchased this book, it discusses copyrights in REM statements in BASIC language, and the ""major"" computer brands such as Apple, IBM, TRS-80, Atari and RadioShack computers ;). The book could be useful in 1985, but not onw unfortunately."
5,Love It!,"This is probably one of the best books in our collection. What a great imagination the author has! I like how at the end you fold back the flap, and there is little Sara fast asleep after her yawn affected so many people. A must have!!"
1,poor choice,I am on my second Hamilton Beach water cooler. The first one leaked almost half a bottle on the floor. The second cooler is going back to the store because the water does not flow out of the cold spout...Will be looking for another brand
1,Hamilton Beach water cooler,We received 2 Hamilton Beach water coolers and both of them are defective. We put a new water bottle on it and the water kept flowing out from the bottom of the cooler. About 1/4 of water from the bottle flowed out. We are really unsatisify with this product.
1,disappointed,"I, too, wish I read reviews on this thing before I bought it. I bought it for my small room because I hate the water from the well system where I'm living. The water is hardly cold and its compressor runs non-stop (which supposedly indicates it's cooling) -- it sends off a lot of heat into the room. I'm taking back."
1,Water spout was clogged!,"The water flow was very weak and extremely slow. After only a month of use, the water spout appeared clogged and barely any water came out. And the water always tasted at room temperature even though it suppose to be cold. Do not recommend!"
4,A unique account of life under the Khmer Rouge,"It is a year since I read this book and it sticks in the mind. In the original French it is gripping and all the stronger for not being written in purple prose - the writer saves her emotion for the the concluding chapters where she realises the extent of the cruelty of the Khmers Rouges and of the deceptions played on her. (She loses her child to malaria - a disease the KR claimed was all but eradicated.) The gradual loss of her illusions is perhaps the real subject of the book. Given that it is the only account we are likely to have from a Westerner of life at the heart of the KR apparat we are as well served as we could hope to be.I note that the only other person who seems to have read this book describes the writer as a ""bourgeois Marxist"". I am not sure if this is either accurate or fair: If I recall correctly Ms Picq came from a blue collar background; and any connexion between the KR and the 19th century thinker called Marx is pretty tenuous."
2,Beyonde the horizon,"This story of a french woman, married yo a cambodian career revolutionay is sometimes quite incredible. It is quite understandable that she complains about the beheviour of her husband who is more interested in his career than in his family. But suddenly there is a new child in the family..... From the same husband. And the family stays in distress..."
2,"A sterile, uninformative account by a bourgeois Marxist.","Perhaps it was the translation (poor quality) or the author's lack of writing and story-telling skills, but her account of what must have been a harrowing experience was not involving because the author's ""voice"" was totally devoid of emotions and visual descriptions. Her account read as if HAL (from 2001:A Space Odessey) had written it.Or, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein: ""There's no THERE there."" I gave my copy to my local library."
2,Bad Series,"This series from Syngress/Osbourne obviously has no editor or an editor without Industry knowledge. These books cover each objective and thats it, plus the objectives are revealed from the authors standpoint instead of Cisco's. They jump from objective to objective without tying information together. The editor also forgot to check continuity in the examples and figures of the text. A lot of the training aids are wrong with multiple spelling and translational errors that give the reader cause to second guess themselves as well as the book and it's authors. It is written from an informational standpoint instead of the authoritative standpoint which is required in a ""teaching"" book. Buy books from the creators of the tests (Cisco) or find a truly authoritative author and buy his/her books."
2,Dissapointed,"I am half-way through this book and it has NUMEROUS mistakes. I find it hard to learn from a book where I have to question whether everything I read is correct or not. Luckily, if you are logical you'll spot the most obvious errors but it is dissapointing to say the least to be able to spot mistakes in areas that you have no background in.I bought the book because I liked the way that it covered the exam topics and for the boatload of questions throughout the book. I don't know if the other books are any better, but with this one I find myself gathering information from other books and online sources to check what I'm reading. This is annoying if your trying to cover the information quickly."
2,Shoot the editor,"This book covers some topics fairly well and others not so well. There are numerous errors in it and not just typos. A few of the other reviewers also noted this. Many of the errors are in critical places such as IP addresses in examples being wrong. If you already know the subjects somewhat, you'll know the errors when you see them. If you don't know the subjects, you'll be totally confused. This is the only CCNP book I've read so I can't recommend anything else but I don't recommend this one."
2,Too many mistakes,"I agree entirely with R. Krisman (""Should be better."" Far too many mistakes. I certainly learned a lot by troubleshooting the books errors, but much to my frustration. With so many good books in the market, this one needs a serious re-editing."
1,"mistakes, mistakes, and more mistakes","This book is by far the worst book I have ever read. After only reading 2 chapters I have found numerous mistakes, some of which made it very difficult to understand. Some of the scenario questions asked the reader to answer things that were not even covered at that point. I did however complete the reading of the entire book and was more confused then when I first started.When trying to contact the author and editor for comments, I was passed from one HR personnel to another before eventually giving up.I've developed technical courseware books in the past and highly recommend not to buy this book if you are studying for the CCNP Routing exam. Other recommendations would be to read the Exam Cram and Cisco Press Routing books."
1,How Sad!,"This book had so many errors that I couldn't believe it. I mean very easy to catch errors, typos, etc.More disappointing was that the CD continued to have those same errors.For example, it says that a PRIVATE address range was:10.0.0.0 - 255.0.0.0When the correct answer is:10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255Please do not buy this book! Unless you think its fun to constantly be checking with other sources to ensure what you are studying is correct."
2,mediocre to poor resource!,"Avoid this book. Mistakes, poor coverage of OSPF & BGP, poor ""exam-sim"" software. Spend your money elsewhere."
1,TOO MANY MISTAKES,"I used Todd's books to get My MCSE as well as my CCNA & CCDA. I Deserve this horrible book for not waiting for todd's book to come out. This is the worse Cisco book I have ever read. There are Mistakes after Mistakes. I takes you double the Time to read the book Because you keep going back and fixing authors mistakes. Mistakes are in Cisco Ios commands, VLSM And diagrams. Save Time and Money by Todd's BooksANKUR RAWAT CCNA,CCDP, MCSE, MCSE+I,"
1,"Mistakes, repetitions, and disorganized",I found this book to be full of mistakes and repetitions. The material is very disorganized. It jumps from one topic to another without proper transition or explanation of terminology. It's very frustrating to read the book. I feel that each chapter (or even each section in a chapter) is written by different people. Poor cohesiveness. Don't recommend it. I will try a better-written text.
3,Many typo's and mistakes,"Not a bad book - not great either. Just too many mistakes for a tech book, especially a study guide. However, if you can find the mistakes I guess you are learning! The CD is not the best, with a high percentage of questions that are simplistic and some others not worded well. Would make a good supliment book should you use more than one - which is the best idea anyway."
5,Bob Never Sounded So Good,"My late husband was Bob Dylan's biggest fan, so much of our 38 years of marriage had Dylan's gravelly voice as background music. So even though Tom is gone, I still feel compelled to fill the house with Dylan's music. This find is a treasure! I've been listening to some of these songs for decades, but Muldaur's interpretation makes many of them really beautiful love songs, something I didn't hear or appreciate in Bob's originals. I love Muldaur's sexy, sassy voice. She really makes me smile."
5,Easy Intertainment,This is one of the most relaxing album I have purchased in a long time. Regardless of my mood listening to this album makes it better.
3,Heart of Mine: Love Songs of Bob Dylan - Maria Muldaur,Not the gutsy sound that I had expected from Muldaur. Pretty tame.
3,THIN MAN,"Dylan fans probably won""t like,too blusy,same tempo,no ups or down.Maria listeners will say great album..."
3,Maria's Great Sultry Voice: A Little Too Mellow on Bob,"Maria Muldar's sultry, mellow and throaty voice sounds wonderful as usual as she floats through this wide collection of Dylan songs. She sings them in slow tempo and ideally these songs are best for a romantic evening. However, I sometimes found the tempo too slow and the instrumental a bit too laid back. A case in point is my favorite Dylan song ""Lay Lady Lay"" where I miss Dylan's driving and almost desperate emphasis when he belts out ""Why wait any longer for the world to beginYou can have your cake and eat it too"". She sounds wonderful on all the songs with her sexy voice and her touch of humor as noted where she insets the word ""sheep"" for what sounds like to most people Dylan's reference to ""sleep"" creating an interesting contextual change to the song. Always a fan, I just would have liked some faster tempo mixed in."
4,Fair price for the entire set.,"You get all three movies for the price of about 1 and a half, and it comes in a nice box set. It's still not a great price considering that you can buy an entire season of Family Guy for the same price.This is about the length of around 6 episodes.I'll review the the actual movies themselves seperately later. Let's just say Blue Harvest is good, SSSDS is great,and It's a Trap sucks for now."
4,"super funny, but R rated language occasionally","The trilogy is spooftastic, but my 9 year old was exposed to some f-bombs I wasn't expecting from the TV version. Otherwise, I recommend highly for Star Wars and Family Guy fans."
3,"It`s ok, but.....it`s a trap!","I expected more when I got Something, something darkside. One year after,it happened the same when I got It's a trap, I really felt dissapointed. Both don't have the same level than Blue Harvest, which has funny jokes and bunch of good stuffs for Star Wars and Family Guys fans. I think Seth`s ideas has gone.Besides,I have a Mac, and it has been imposible to download the digital copy to I tunes because the code doesn't work.I am really huge Family guy Fan, but I think the Family Guy's creators have gone down, because the show isn't funny like other seasons."
1,What a load of crap,You would think that FOX would have included digital copies of all three movies. But noooooooooo! You only get the digital copy of the 3rd movie. The films are all very funny but the marketing of the set simply stinks.
3,Dolby 5.1 is not true.,"Apparently none of the movies are in 5.1, the ""how to digital copy"" segments before the movies were, but the movies were all in 2 channel. I have a Yamaha receiver that shows the audio output on the display and every movie it went to the two channel set up. I was curious why it's even listed as 5.1 dolby on the audio selection on the on screen menu as well even though it's not."
4,Another Quinnell keeper.,"A. J. Quinnell wrote ""The Mahdi"", one of my top 10 suspense books. ""Blood Ties"" has several plots running parellel in time, which will intersect unexpectedly. I'm thrilled I no longer have to buy used library copies, and can use my Kindle. As I obtain other titles not in my library, what a feast/refeast awaits me! (Forgot I was on my husband's sign-in.) Mrs. Hank"
5,Another Great Quinnell Novel,"This guy is just amazing, I have yet to read a book from him that I didnt like. the story takes a little while to get into, but once it does, theres just soo much going on to keep you busy and wanting to read more. The story was great, well written characters Like Cady (cause hes from Canada!!!)Overall a great story, check it out if you can find it !!Also keep your eyes out for a new Quinnell novel comming out mid 2005 !!!!"
5,Excellent documentary,A gripping story about the courage and faith of one man who defied the odds and lived to tell about it. An inspiring movie that I highly recommend to students and anyone interested in history.
4,Tra vels all over the world in all kinds of ways,"In this very funny book Brian Thacker describes jounreys he has made in many different countries using many different forms of transport. He is equally amusing whether he is writing about traveling by moped in Greece, taxi in Belfast, jeep in Hawaii, camel in Egypt, skis in Switzerland, elephant in Thailand, bicycle in China, horse in Mongolia,or any of the other many and varied forms of transport he's used in his life so far. Some of his observations puzzle me a little, I can't think why he dislikes Macdonalds, for instance, if you have children they're a godsend, and dirt cheap too. As with 'Rule No.5, no sex on the bus' the humour is a bit crude at times, but if you don't mind that you will enjoy this book."
4,Hilarious! A must read for anyone who has ever traveled!,"I bought this book and couldnt put it down. I was laughing out loud continuously throughout the chapters of Rule No.5 No Sex on the Bus!Anyone who has ever traveled to Europe either on a Tour Guide or seeing the sights on their own will appreciate Brian Thacker's sense of humor, his outspokeness about misunderstood european culture and all the things we wish we could say outloud but didnt!It will re-unite you with Europe all over again, or for first time visitors it will give you a down to earth perspective of what its like touring Europe on a bus.This book is one you will enjoy page after page and have you feeling you are apart of the ""Tour"". =))"
4,A pretty good piece of tarot..,I came across this particular tarot one night shopping at one of New York City's flee markets...it is pretty theatrical in it's appearance and rather traditional in it's postures...I have used for the last 4 years and have become very attached to it...it is very stimulating to the imagination in a rather subtle way...the colors are somewhat muted compared to the more cinematic flavored decks...I have made a fair amount of money with this deck.
2,slip for a slip,"I was excited to try this out as I had seen mediocre reviews of this product on QVC. It was quite expensive but I needed a strapless slip with slimming features. But as with other reviews, this does slim you somewhat as it is a slip not a bodysuit BUT the top rolls down below your breasts. There is no way to keep it in place. Little body movement, and it is down. I was constantly in the bathroom fixing it. But it did give me the tummy and rear firmness that I was looking for in a form-fitting strapless dress that one can easily get in and out of for the bathroom that the other products really limit you. For the price it is not worth it."
3,Works as advertised,I am happy with the product. I needed a strapless bra to wear with my Mother of the Groom dress. This will work. It makes me look somewhat flat chested - but with the dress it is OK.
4,"""Eins sehr gut Buch"" publically exclaimeth the Liebermeister","This book was very cleverly written. I had only one problem with the text.The ending, I thought, was not bad, but rather an easy way to end. Other than that, I enjoyed it. Snicket's style and his name are not boisterously humourous, but rather inducing you to have the surreptious smirk of dry humour. There are many allusions through the series,and I understand them all. I also have figured part of the Beatrice enigma. This book is not depressing at all, and by no means will it give a child low self-esteem, or any of those other fabricated problems made by adults."
3,The Vile Village,"In ""The Vile Village"" the Beaudelaire orphans are back with new guardians again. They again are trying to keep one step ahead of Count Olaf, who wants to get his greedy hands on their fortune.The books in this series seem a bit repetitive, however, with the introduction of the Quagmire triplets a few books ago, I continue to read in hopes of actually solving some of the mystery written into the books. Will the Quagmire triplets be found, and what exactly is V.F.D? One of these questions is answered in this book while another still remains a mystery. In addition, we have a new mystery to be solved. I keep coming back to these books to get the answers, regardless of how slowly the answers come.A good series for children, I, however, at age 30, have become a bit bored with them."
3,The Vile Village,"This is a book of very unfortunate events, that is highly disturbing and sad at times. It's a very mysterious and impressive book I thought. This book starts with a fifteen year old lady named Vioet, and her two siblings Klaus and Sunny. They are trying to find their parents , who they lost during a fire. And they are on the run from a evil man. Every clue they find leads to another. Oh yes, did I tell you they are in the middle of nowhere . Lemony Snicket , the auther did a really good job with this book. Take it for a spin"
4,The Vile Village,These orphans lose their parents in a fire. The first home they went to was the worst of them all. There guardian was Count Olaf and has been after the kids fortune ever since he had heard the fortune could be his. Olaf captured two of the closest and only friends they had. The kids are on the run to get their friends back and at the same time their trying not to get captured into one of Olaf's plans. To go through these experiances read the book to see what I mean. Beware these books may give you nightmares so I'd segust reading the book during the day.Happy Reading
2,"Vile Village, Vile Book","BookBatWould you like it if instead of two parents, an entire town was taking care of you? Well, in the book The Vile Village by Lemony Snicket, Violet, Sunny, and Klause are being taken care of by a town called V.F.D. and staying with the handy man named Hector. The three of them and Hector have to do chores all day, every day. The Quagmire triplets are being held captive by Count Olaf, who is after the Quagmire Sapphires and the Baudelaire fortune. To me, this was the first book of the series that I just wanted to read it and get it over with so I could go on to the next book. I didn't like it because it wasn't very exciting and it was too predictable. If you read the other books, can tell which people are in disguise and helping Count Olaf. Will Count Olaf succeed at getting the Quagmire Saphires and the Baudilaire forutune? Or will the Baudilaire Orphans live happy live forever? Read to find out!"
4,Dark but amusing,"My 8 year old and I are enjoying this series. They are dark but in an amusing way. It's hard to say why they are appealing but they are. The three children are resourceful and with ingenuity figure out how to escape the evil Count Olaf on their own. A few of the grown ups are well meaning and kind but they are mostly ineffectual, inefficient and useless. I guess what we like is the fact that the kids are clever and solve their problems with little help from grown ups. They may try some tactic that doesn't work so they try something else. Each child has their own speciality and different situations call for different tactics. They work well as a team, sharing the hardships and responsibilities.The author does some interesting things like using big words and stopping to give the definition. Sometimes the definition is slightly skewed toward fitting the story and even that makes it amusing."
5,"A book full of sadness, surprise and much more!","From a crow-covered village, to a kind cleaner, this book was totally worth reading! The poor Baudilaire orphans, whose parents were killed in a house fire, were moved to live with Count Olaf-who has been following the three Baudilaires, Sunny, Violet and Klaus from home to home. Each time, disguised as someone different, and with a different plan to get closer to the Baudilaires fortune, along with the help of his crew of women, men, and women who look like men. Throughout my 11 years of eager reading, I have never read a series quite this exciting! I highly recommend these books to people age 9 and up. Although all the books of this series are never-put-downs, this one was by far soaring higher than the rest!"
5,The Vile Village,"By: Lemony SnicketName of the book: A Series Of Unfortunate events #7 ""The Vile Village"".It is a town named V.F.D! The three Baudelaires siblings found Hector, the handyman to live with. Later, on the street, they got some news from Count Olaf disguised as Detective Dupin. He said that they were murderers! Hector and the Baudelaires got into big trouble. What will happen there? Read the A Series Of Unfortunate Events #7 ""The Vile Village"" to find out!This book was interesting (I liked it) because when the siblings went to jail, Violet's invention helped them. Just like when I was trapped in Costco and I was thinking about how to get out and get help just like the orphans.If your parents are still alive and your are in fourth grade .You really should read ""The Vile Village"". But if you are in third grade and you are an orphan, don't read it! There are two reasons, one, it is too hard for third graders. Two, if you are an orphan, it might hurt your feelings. Make a smart decision!"
2,Lemony Turns Sour,"I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series. This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told? Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them. 6,000 times."
2,Boring...,I wasn't very happy about this book. It was very boring to me. I didn't get the whole point of this story at all. So I give it a two out of five.
1,idc,the book was very interesting. it was about a mystery. it always kept me on the edge of my steat. it rememded of me because they were doing doing stuff they were sopposed to be doing AND IT WAS FULL A POEMS and i like poems. it was fun but it was was hard. the best thing about IT WAS THAT THERE IS A SEQUAL
2,I picked up this book by accident...,"There's a note on the back of this book from the author that says, ""Dear Reader, You have undoubtably picked up this book by accident, so please put it down."" I think I should have listened to him then. Bad things start happening on the first page. This book was gloomy, and barely nothing happy ever happens. The author does warn you, however. In this book, three orphans are sent to a very stange town, where thay are made to do chores all day. Meanwhile, they are getting mysterious notes from their old friends, who are in the clutches of the villian, Count Olaf. This was a very strange book. It's the reader's choice whether he or she wants to take the author's advice on the back of the book. My advice is to do as the author tells you: put the book down."
1,No product received,I have yet to receive any communication from the seller about my books. I have not received the books or even an e-mail stating that they have been shipped. I would like my money back because I do not think that this is an honest merchant.
5,"Caw, Caw!","Ever heard the expression ""It takes a village to raise a child""? Well, this time, Mr. Poe takes the phrase a little TO seriously, a word which here means ""sends the poor orphans into VFD, the Village of Fowl Devotees"". In this book, you will discover a fake police officer, to many rules, the super deluxe jail cell, the Quagmires in a fountain, and plastic shoes worn by Count Olaf, and ugly hats. LEMONY SNICKET IS AT IT AGAIN!"
5,This book was astounding,I think this book was the most thrilling one of the series so far.It is an amazing book from beginning to end.
1,Dont know.. book never fully downloaded..,Book didn't fully download.. so paid money.. for no book.. Kinda bad for a child.. who was so excited.. Tried going on line to try to redownload.. there wasn't anything to say having trouble..
4,Amazing,This series is simply just getting better and better. Also if you want to read this series start from the bad beginning which is then first book.
5,Best book,You will just not want to stop reading. I would read wherever I would be. Applause to . Lemony Snicket
4,Nice follow-up to a great album,"Goin' to Town is a worthy follow-up to West By Southwest--really right on par with it. Just like the latter album, Goin' sees heavy rotation in my changer. To be honest, it's never out of the player. Favorites include Trav'lin' Light, Three Quarter Moon, and Louisiana Moon. Those are all sentimental ballads, but there are plenty of uptempo tunes like the title track if that's your preference. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this CD is destined to make a big splash. If you like western, western swing, or Craig Chambers's past efforts, listen to the sound clips and then give it a shot."
1,Deceived or not?,"Hello, I want to give a short statement. I recognize through this book that Rebecca has an exact knowledge about demons but not all wisdom that`s why she herself is deceived.The blood of Jesus Christ will reveal it to you. Bye"
2,becoming a vessel of honor,This is an awesome book. I am very sad however that the copy you sent me is missing 3 entire chapters from it. I'm not sure i'll order from Amazon again.
1,Rebecca Brown is a Fraud,"Rebecca Brown (real name: Ruth Bailey) had her license to practice medicine revoked by the state of Indiana for massively injecting herself, her live-in lesbian lover (Mrs. Elaine Moses) and Mrs. Moses' daughter (then a minor) with Demerol. Mrs. Moses almost died in the ER, which started the whole police investigation. Rebecca Brown's husband, Daniel Yoder (real name: William Stewart) has a criminal record with multiple convictions for various types of fraud. Their yarn that he is an ""international banker"" from a ""prominent Jewish family"" simply is not true. These people are highly skilled con artists and liars. Please read the objective journalistic expose of Rebecca Brown at (...) to learn the truth about her."
4,This book will not bore you!,"This book is mainly a book on how to deliver people from occultic bondage. The first couple of chapters are ,again, in story form. Rebecca gives information on how satanist use pushpins and occultic symbols/etc to curse and therefore destroy people. The other part of the book is a deliverance manuel. Rebecca, as a doctor, gives examples by case studies/with a complete breakdown of the person including past history in the occult/lifestyle/etc. Then she goes into techniques (prayers to be said- in every area of the persons life- for complete deliverance).I'm begining to believe that she may be telling the truth. Regardless, I am disgusted how the body of Christ is so NOT united. ... Final point: Rebecca is probablty telling the truth and I'm beginning to feel sorry for her."
3,Ok read,"Interesting reading but I did not share many of the views of the author. The book was educational reading, however."
5,Becoming a Vessel of Honor by Dr Rebecca Brown,The book was just like new and arrived quickly! Thank you for a great experience!
5,Great Glazing Product!,Glazol is leagues better than cheap DAP crap. Excellent workability and performance. I recommend this product to anyone glazing or re-glazing windows!!!
3,Quality issues,"My original review is below, which still stands, but after a second purchase I had to edit this and downgrade the rating for poor quality control. My first purchase was just fine. The second bottle was all cloudy and tasted metallic. I contacted the company and they are sending a replacement, but had no explanation for what happened or why.Thing is, if I had received the cloudy product first, I would never have known how it was supposed to be.Original review: Another reviewer commented on how bad this tasted. If you want sweet fake-cherry-flavored syrup, you may agree. However, look at the labels. This unflavored stuff has a higher percentage of minerals than the other flavored ones that I compared. I'm buying it for the minerals, not the flavorings. And, in my opinion, it doesn't taste that bad."
4,mixing the ingredients,"Buried Treasure Colloidal Minerals Pure 32 OzI've been using this fine product over two years now and it's been a great benefit for health and weight loss. Taking an ounce of this in the morning is better than having 4 cups of coffee or one of those energy drinks. Yes the taste of the liquid does have a slightly strong aftertaste (almost as if drinking liquid aspirin), but I found that one ounce of Buried Treasure mixed with an ounce of your favorite fruit juice (100% Welch's grape juice for me) does wonders and it's quite good after that."
2,"Good Stories, Bad Tape Presentation","""The Laughing Fish"" introduced the new era of Batman animation, and it's a solid story. The Joker's licensing scheme and the resultant skewering of corporate financial dealings makes good comedy. This episode is also notable for the introduction of Harley Quinn as Joker's moll--a character who grew so popular in the animated series that DC Comics eventually had to introduce her to the regular DC Universe (Kevin Smith fans will also note that he has named his daughter after her).While the animation and story are great, this tape is recorded in EP mode, meaning you'll get fuzzy picture and muffled sound. The packaging drops the rating from four stars to two stars."
3,not a classic but good,the first episode is very good but the second one is more gruesome than entertaining althou it's definitly better than the riddler
3,Dahon knock-off,"FYI...this same bike is also branded ""Yeah"" and available from various vendors. They go for considerably less under the Yeah brand name. The folding mechanism and other parts are patented by and used under license from Dahon. These bikes are decent for the price, but used Dahons such as the Speed or Vitesse sell on clearance for just a bit more, have a larger number of shops that can work on them, and hold their value better than these knockoffs."
4,Great watch,"This watch is very light and comfortable. The watch is very easy to read at night. The band could be a little longer. I have average size rists and the band just fits. If you have big rists, I would look at a different model."
2,Disappointed Luminox Purchaser,"In every way except one I love this watch. The nylon band was comfortable, the dial was easily read and astoundingly bright at night. But for the price paid and the advertised (and expected) quality, the minute hand never lined up with the numbers/dots. I expected better. I kept the watch and still have it but I continue to be disappointed in the minute hand's alignment. I won't buy another. I want to qualify one thing: I did not send this watch in for repair due to this error. I expect that Luminox would have repaired it though I did not give them the chance. I've kept it and will continue to wear it as is."
1,The product is different from the picture,"I am very disappointed about the product. The product i received is luminox a3901 series II instead of luminox a3901 original version(the picture one). I have found the original one for a long time. The luminox a3901 series II can buy in everywhere but the luminox a3901 original has been stopped produced. When I see the original one in amazon, i was very happy that i finally can have one. however, the product i received is just a extremely normal one. So disappointed!"
1,Out of sync,Really liked the watch as soon as I got it - it was just what I was looking for. But soon it became apparent that the minute and hour hands were out of sync. When the minute hand reaches the 12 the hour hand is well past the hour it is supposed to be at. I've had the watch about 8 months now and it gets more and more out of sync. I guess I could send it in to be looked at but still have to pay $10 to have just that done. I decided to forget the whole thing and get some other watch. Very disappointing.
2,Dissappointed!!!,My wife bought me the yellow face version a few years ago. Boy was I overjoyed at the yellow face with the Seal logo. However after two years it stopped working. I thought the battery was bad. Took it to get it replaced and found salt water had entered it and caused damage. It was over $90 to get repaired. I sold the watch for $50 and bought me a Tommy Bahama instead with a yellow face. I will never buy brand again or recommend one to anyone.
5,"luminox, great watch for anyone!","I am a watch hound, I have over 20 watches in my collection everyting from Omega to Ball and all in between.I have owned a Luminox 3900 series for over 7 years now, and will say this is the best everyday watch I have ever owned. I work in Law Enforcement and spend a lot of time boarding foregin vessels at sea in the Gulf of Mexico. I am also a diver and have been down to 40 feet several times with this watch and never had a problem.I have replaced the battery once and the watch band once (after my boxer tried to eat my watch, no scratches on the face or case.)Great watch for the money, I wish I would have known about these watches when I was in the Navy."
2,Beneath the Outsider,"A full-blown, foolhardy Philosophical flop, full of flapdoodle.You'd be better off just re-reading the original."
4,In Fisherman - Freshwater Trophies,"In Fisherman: Freshwater Trophies is a great fishing game. Being able to fish for other freshwater species besides bass is a big plus. Fishing for walleye, northern pike, muskie, carp, sauger, lake trout, etc. is a blast. This game even features online fishing tournaments for added replay value.This game does have its flaws, but not as bad as other fishing games I have played through the years.5 stars for fun.4 stars overall."
2,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to playing a more modern fishing simulator. My best one is several years old. This one didn't impress me at all. I tried hard to like it and use the different features.My biggest gripe is the ""lure-cam"" - The underwater camera's field is too narrow - I can't see the fish!... - As a fisherman, I don't want to manipulate the camera while teasing the fish - That's to much to do.Even at the current low price, I can't recommend it. Sorry."
2,Pretty Bad,I bought this game off the discount rack and could only play it for a little while unitl I got frustrated and quit. The graphics are poor and the boat gets stuck all the time. Half the time you make a cast and it says something about the fish was missed and ends the cast. I would not recommend this fishing game.
1,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i picked up this game in a hurry knowing it was in fisherman. i knew they would give you info. about the fish. and best of all you can catch catfish!!!!!! but this game is repetative. you can use a fish finder that doesnt help. what came up as a huge fish on the fish finder was the smallest (...)crappie ive ever seen!!!!!!!!!! and the music!!!!!!! the music is what makes you angry in the morning. im like shut up. i know that you picked the first 3rd grade band you could find but at least dont tell us that. if you press mute you should have a good time w/ the game 4 4 hours tops. fish realistike and lures are realistike but i do wish the graphics were better.
4,Palm Tree Shower Curtain,"I am very happy with my product. I can't say that for the delivery process. It was ordered as a Christmas gift on December 06, 2006 from Target@Amazon, and I finally received it on April 25, 2007."
3,There are better books on RH Administration,"I was really hoping for a good reference for doing real SysAdmin work, this book is too geared towards beginners. First hint is how it mainly covers using GUI Admin tools. It doesn't cover the files being modified by the GUI tools enough. Two other gripes the paper its printed on is very cheap almost like a phone book. Second the index is horrible. As an SysAdmin I live in indexes and table of contents so I can get to the specific information I need quickly. A bad index ruins a book for me as a good reference..."
2,"Only handles ""smooth sailing"" issues","I have a copy. It has its good points and its bad points.+ It quickly gets you set up using the Red Hat GUI tools. Using it so set up Samba and NFS was trivial.- It is very Red Hat specific. It only rarely talks about the underlying Linux configuration files and formats.- If anything goes wrong (say for example permissions were set incorrectly on /etc/myConfiguration), you will have NO CLUE what to do next if the GUI tool fails. You may not even know file names.If you want to know how to do typical configuration tasks, and you stay close to the vanilla Red Hat installation, this book may be OK.On the other hand, if you are using any other installation, or modifying default Red Hat tools, this book doesn't really help. It will NOT tell you much about what the GUI tool actually configured for you."
4,Fast service,"Great service. Was notified the item would be a couple of days late, but still arrived relatively quickly. Quality perfect."
4,Good book that should be reprinted.,"I am fortunate to own both this and More MYOG. I bought them both in Utah, at Deseret Industries (a thrift store chain). I tell you this because that chain has the BEST stuff and if you're driving through the state, STOP AND VISIT!. I'd go back to Utah just for DI!But about the book: It has wonderful recipes,including Corn Toasties, a pop-in-the-toaster breakfast food kind of like corn bread slices. It was available in stores in the 70s but I haven't seen it in years. Also has corn chips like Frito's, baby foods, cold cuts ... lots of stuff you don't normally see in these types of cookbooks. Published by Bobbs-Merrill company of Indiana.This is worth going to your library and asking them to do an ILL (inter-library loan) to find it. Some of the recipes are dated and won't appeal, but there is lots of good stuff in here."
3,There are other options,"I used to own this book but sold it several years ago but not for $100. Really people, you don't need to pay outlandish prices for this book. Anything that is in this book can be found anywhere on the internet for FREE. Just put your fingers to work and search google! You can find just about anything. Also, a lot of these recipes can be found on Pinterest and sites like food.com (formerly recipezarr)."
3,Not all inclusive,"Good manual for unit repairs, unfortunately does not include fluid types, quantities, or maintenance procedures."
5,Top notch,"This item has everything expected in a shop manual, but as expected needs the parts manual to go with it."
4,Had to have it,I needed the info to set my governor linkage and the information was in the book. Got it running like a charm in short order. Book is few pages but some pretty good info.
3,Not totally satisfied.,I have been using product for a few weeks along with my girlfriend who got the female version. We both have been feeling more tired a fatigued when running. We think maybe it helps because if you take it for a while and then stop you will feel a lot better. Maybe I just haven't been using it long enough.
3,"Nothing tops ""Bad Girl"" (see release dates below)","Somewhat disappointed to learn upon hearing this CD that nothing the band did comes close to the manic energy of ""Bad Girl"" (which is available on the ""Nuggets Original Artyfacts"" 4-CD compilation and was my introduction to The Zakary Thaks). Band-member, Chris Gerniottis, states The Zakary Thaks is best-represented on the first two singles and the B-side of the third (before management began to interfere with the direction of the band).Discography is as follows: J-Beck #J-1006 Bad Girl b/w I Need You (1966); J-Beck #J-1009 Face to Face b/w Weekday Blues (1967); J-Beck #J-1101 Please b/w Won't Come Back (1967); J-Beck #J-1103 Mirror of Yesterday b/w Can't You Hear Your Daddy's Footsteps (1967); Thak #1001 Green Crystal Ties b/w Green Door (1968); and Cee-Bee #1005 Everybody Wants to be Somebody b/w Outprint (1969). Enjoy."
2,A little lacking,"I ordered this via Amazon. It was delivered in a regular Amazon box, very discreet. The package was in a white plastic bag inside of the box. It is made up of a soft material that gives when you squeeze it. It is about 4 1/2 inches long. It has three ridges of graduating sizes. The top ridge is 4 1/2 inches in circumference, the second ridge is about 4 3/4 inches in circumference and at the base it is 5 1/2 inches in circumference. It is very quiet. I think is is shaped kinda weird and too short. The vibrations are not earth shaking. It didn't do much for external stimulation either. I thought is was just kinda okay, nothing special. I used it and kept waiting & waiting & waiting. I think I would burn up the batteries before I got any satisfaction."
5,Love those Lucid Dreams.,"Quiet, powerful, nice size, sturdy and effective, what more could a girl ask for! I love the Lucid Dreams collecton!"
3,OK,"This movie has it's moments, but it's not the best disaster film you could see. While the scenes when the comet finally hits is impressive, I feel the filmmakers took too long getting to the climax. much of the movie is just talk. And although the CGI effects in the 30 seconds of disaster scenes are impressive (espacially for a 90's movie) parts of the movie are pretty unrealistic and corny. I'm not saying this movie was bad, it's not. It's just that it could have been more exciting, like Armageddon. This is an OK film for a rainy day, but Titanic and Independence Day are much better films of this genre."
2,*snore*,"Why can't people make entertaining asteroid movies for once? This movie is very boring, and the only good part is a 2 minute disaster at the end. Armageddon was a stupid romance movie, Deep Impact was a boring drama and Asteroid was a boring romance movie! Spend more time on the disaster seens!"
3,Old stuff,"This movie and its illegimate twin, ""Armageddon,"" are efforts to ""do better""--through special effects--than a really good movie of several years ago on the same subject. It fails. I think the older movie was entitled ""Asteroid"" and it starred Sean Connery and Natalie Wood. The special effects in that one were adequate and the plot and action much better."
3,See Armageddon,"This movie has a very slow start. I recommend Armageddon. Deep Impact is just plain copying Armageddon. They try to blow up the asteroid by drilling a hole and dropping a nuke. Sound fimilier? Over all, the movie wasnt that bad."
1,"The ""Ishtar"" of the 90s","This movie is awful! Take a bunch of really good actors, mix them with a bunch of so-so actors from bad NBC sitcoms (Men Behaving Badly and that goofy tabloid sitcom that Tea Leoni was in), and you have a horrible story. Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall must have done this for the money. The movie introduces too many characters. Tea Leoni plays an awful MSNBC journalist. Additionally, MSNBC is advertised all over the place in this movie. Robert Duvall is not a convincing older astronaut. Neither are any of the other actors portraying astronauts. I've seen B movies with a better script."
1,Trading Star Power For Crappy Effects,"If you like the premise of Armageddon but can't stand Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck, then Deep Impact is for you! Full of twists, like when the asteroid breaks into two seperate parts and the smaller one crashes into the Earth and destroys the entire east coast of the United States and they successfully destroy the other one buy having the astronauts drive a space shuttle bomb into it. Wait, did I just ruin the movie? The only bright spots are when Morgan Freeman are on camera."
1,Deep Suck,"Great,they made 2 movies of a really good idea and they both deeply SUCK!Armageddon at least had effects and good action but this doesnt even have that.Bad characters,terrible acting,really bad sub-plots and it just gets boring.The only good thing compared to Armageddon is that here you get to see the comet hit.After the first ten minutes after they tried to blow up the comet i started thinking ""Cant that comet already hit earth"" but nooo,we have to see how the newsreporter played by Tea Leoni settles his problems with her daddy and how Elijah Wood(Most annoying actor after Leo DiCaprio must say) fights to save her girlfriend/wife.When the comet finally hit i couldnt hold my laughter when Tea Leonis character hugs her father.Its got cheesy moments that would be great for MST3K,oh wait,it was cancelled darn,now theres no use for this movie.Still Armageddon sucked also."
3,"ABOVE AVERAGE ,BUT NOT ARAMAGEDDON","Deep Impact is more of a dramatic movie than Armageddon ,but lacks the all around action filled atmosphere that Armageddon produces."
2,rent don't buy,"It is worth seeing but not worth buying. They tried to do too much in a short movie. It needed to be a three part mini series. The first day would have shown the discovery of the comet, the second showing the attempts to stop it and the third showing the destruction and aftermath.Well that is my two cents worth...."
3,"Great entertainment, but poor DVD","As its been said 53 times before me, Deep Impact is more realistic than the idiotic, misogynistic Armageddon. It also manages to be disturbing, not ridiculous, in its depiction of disaster. So why wasn't one of the more pleasant surprises of 1998 given a better treatment on DVD? No extras to speak of, except a blah trailer. Production notes, or some sort of commentary would've been welcome. The widescreen is nice, however. Oh yeah, how come those astronauts caught in space dont grow beards or long hair after a year? A huge error in a pretty good movie."
2,GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS SO-SO STORYLINE,I found DEEP IMPACT somewhat dissappointing although the special effects are great the acting is not and here's why. I found the whole storylines involving TEA LEONI'S character as well as ELIJAH WOOD'S soap opera style and boring although I do think MORGAN FREEMAN and ROBERT DUVALL do a great job in thier roles it's not enough to compensate for the above metiond. Anyway in my opinion the special effects are the only thing besides FREEMAN and DUVALL that save this movie so all in all I can't recommend it.
5,one of Dremaworks' best so far!,"With the similarities among this movie and Armagedon, it's obvious there are going to be people that preffer one over the other. And this one is obviously the choice of the serious and intelligent moviegoers. It has an intelligent plot, great actors, breathtaking special effects, and despite the fact of the 'science-fiction' level of the E.L.E., it still manages to grasp reality in a very moving way. Armagedon on the other hand, lacks every single element that makes this movie so great. But, someone has to make movies for the poorly educated, empty headed moviegoer."
3,The More Things Change ...,"47(!) years earlier (in 1951), George Pal produced ""When Worlds Collide."" The premise of this film was that the earth would be destroyed by collision with another celestial object, and that only a select few (and how they are selected forms the core of the film) could be saved. Is this starting to sound vaguely familiar?About the only improvement I can see in the last half century is that the wonderfully gifted Morgan Freeman is cast as U.S. President -- an idea that would have been unthinkable in 1951. The only reason I mention this is because most viewers of the movie I talk to never noticed Mr. Freeman's race -- only his absolute credibility as the President of a nation in crisis. So, to contradict my subject line, I guess things DO change, after all.In any case, the question of how we as a species would deal with our own individidual and collective exinction is a profound one that deserves more thoughtful treatment than it received in either of these films."
3,"Bad start, but gets better","Although with all the large monolouges you could fall asleep, the end was surprisingly captivating. I must admit I rented it to see Elijah. Overall a decent movie if you fast forward through the first 30 min."
3,Realistic disaster movie,"Some likes more armagueddon than deep impact, me I voted for deep impact. The all star cast help much in a very simple movie and also long to begin. The visuals effects made by industrial light & magic are great and this is the only reason to watch this movie."
4,More than just special effects. A very good film!,"I strongly disagree with the Amazon Editorial review written by David Chute.For a film that is now a decade old, Deep Impact still proves to be a powerful, topical film driven by emotion rather than special effects. Granted, it's not perfect. In fact, some viewers will guess several of the plot twists long before they arrive. Predictability and flaws aside, it's still an emotional journey worth taking. Deep Impact is one of the better films of its genre, and is certainly far more enjoyable than ""Armageddon"", the film it is most often compared to.If you enjoy your disaster pictures with an emphasis on character depth, I highly recommend Deep Impact. If all your looking for is a special effects driven action flick, then look elsewhere.JM"
4,"Okay, so it's not Armageddon...","I liked this film. It was not your average disaster movie in that it tries to have a more human slant than its predecessors. Okay, so it fell down a few times, being a bit sugar sweet with the teenage marriage and the daughter who reconciles with her father just before the killer tidal wave hits. However the special effects were good, the acting was not too bad either, and there were one or two toughing moments that were fairly realistic and not overly sugary. I agree it is no Armageddon, but then did it ever want to be like Armageddon? I doubt it. Both are distinct and enjoyable films that just as watchable as each other for different reasons. So if you want a fairly intelligent disaster movie, that tries its best to be interesting and entertaining in the same breath, then watch Deep Impact. It's not bad and it does have its moments."
4,Spielberg produces this one,Just better than Armageddon period. Much more of a human side story here. Special effects come at the latter half of the movie and they are very good.
2,Too boring,"This movie is not the worst iv'e ever seen but still it sucks.The so called ""characte development"" and sub-plots are really just annoying and boring and the effects aren't as good as in Armageddon.I do think sub-plots and character development is always good but not when it's done as bad as this.Here we have two cute kids played by Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobolowsky who want to get married so they can become saved. And because the parents of the girl can't come with them she refuses to save herself go,i mean this is one of the most idiotic things that you can show on TV.And then theres a news reporter who hates his dad and in the end it ends with her hugging her dad on the beach as the tidal wave is about to sweep them of instead of trying to get away.The sub-plots are too boring and the effects just ain't really good."
2,"If you like cinema, get ""Armageddon"", please.","I will only give you three lines to describe the flick: a negro american president - people being warned of the ominous danger several months before the impact and a national lottery to choose the ones who will go to the ""Noah's Ark"" (instead of preparing the whole thing secretly and putting aside the normal citizen as it is and as it must be) - Would any person with a minimum sense of reality believe that? - Finally, an unnecessary dawdling of a tedious plot threaded with unsubstantial clichéed characters following the most banal and predictable unpredictability. Make yourself a favor and get Armaggedon, a western-in-space that will make you think of a post-modern version of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""The Magnificent Seven"". More fun, more epics, and --being a scifi-opera--, more credible by far than this ""Flat Impact""."
2,The whole movie has no point.,"I couldn't figure out what the point of the movie was, it's a bad drama, it wouldn't make a good Sci-Fi movie because of poor Spercial effects, the story is even more ridiculous than in Armaggedon. Don't waste your money, Armageddon is much better."
2,u cant beat armageddon!!!!!!!!,"deep impact was more realistic than armageddon, butarmageddon was way more entertaining!!!!!"
1,Beyond horrible,"Watching this movie was one of the most unpleasant, unenjoyable experiences of my life. There is a scene in it involving drawing straws which makes me want to vomit with rage. This movie should be drug out in the street and shot."
5,"The blend of a love, tsunami, and meteorite movie. By Guillaume","This movie is half a love movie and half an action movie: Sorry, this movie is much to complicated for me to write a summary on it. I can tell you though, what I do think was interesting in this movie: The action. The whole second half of the movie is full of the same type of action that inspired Armagedon.(The first half is really a mistery-to-find-out part.)This movie includes an incredibe tsunami-smashing New York view and a spaceship-landing-on-a-comet view.I do think this is the best tsunami/action/love movie.Recommended to all buyers"
1,Somebody spent good money to make this TURKEY!,"How could Morgan Freeman and Robert Duval have gotten themselves into this boring, stupid, and totally un-entertaining waste of time and money? By the time it was mercifully over, I was embarrassed to think I had actually watched the whole thing, let alone spent money to rent it. The only redeeming factor was my hopeful anticipation that just maybe, something bad might happen to Tea Leoni's obnoxious mouth-breathing character. I liked all the goofy, over the top ""heroes"" in ARMAGEDDON and cheered when they succeeded. In DEEP IMPACT, after the first few minutes, I was rooting for the comet."
1,pure sap garbage (would be 0 stars if it could),"This movie has got to be the most painful to watch action movie ever made. There is about 2 minutes worth watching in this movie and the rest makes you just wish you paid to see Armageddon. More hugs than any movie should ever have, even Bette Midler movies are better than this."
4,Better than Armageddon,"This movie touches emotions that Armageddon cannot. Whereas Armageddon might have the edge in some areas (soundtrack, big moviestars), Deep Impact wins hands down with character and realism. The bottom line, embarrassing as it may be, I cried watching Deep Impact but not Armageddon."
4,An emotional impact,"Yet another of the 90s disaster movies, again, great for what it is.I thought the film tried hard to develop the characters and plot, which I must say a great effort was made on. I don't think this film is bad at all and I wouldn't feel sorry for anyone who enjoys it.The action and effects do not really lay in until the last fifteen minutes but I thought it was worth the wait. We've seen almost everything from giant insects to earthquakes destroy those wonderful buildings in New York, and having a huge wave crash over the city was just as exciting.The first time I watched it in the cinema was amazing and I'm sure almost everyone had a tear in their eye at one point or another. There was also a great feeling of unity amongst everyone, you wonder if we really would all come together when confronted with such a disaster.I think this has to be added to the list of best disaster movies."
3,Lifetime Network presents,"Okay I realize that this was a big budget movie with a stellar cast. I also appreciate the fact that it wasn't half bad - especially when compared to those great seventies clunkers ( Earthquake, Towering Inferno ). Though it's also a very good possibility in twenty five years this movie will be a groaner as well. Nevertheless I couldn't help but think this was a woman's disaster film. Imagine if the Lifetime Network made a disaster film .... you don't have to here it is. Not a terrible way to burn a couple of hours and compared to Armeggedon I suppose it's more ""realistic"" But good gosh Armmeggedon has something this movie dosen't - a sense of fun."
4,Deep Impact Review,"As for the movie, it's good but not great. If it weren't for Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall and the great graphics (at the time) this movie would probably not be too appealing. The story is good but the other actors are lacking, not too mention the cheesy parts the movie is interlaced with.As for the streaming, I have a great internet connection, which probably helps a lot. The service works great. The picture quality was very good, the sound was also good and the movie loaded and played without any problems. Netflix better watch out ;)"
4,Action Drama Excitement,"I enjoy action and drama with excitement. This I found very enjoyable... Consists of saving the world, but a good played out movie.. Several high actors are in this movie... I would recommend this movie if you enjoy,action,drama and excitement. ! Some parts keep you on the edge of your seat!"
3,"Typical ""Earth ending disaster"" movie",This film is a typical end of the earth disaster film. It really has nothing in it that rises above average.
4,End of the world movie,"Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff, but a little slow if you don't. The action isn't bad but it's not over the top like Armaggedon."
5,"Good exciting stuff, still with a semi/happy ending.","Very plausible story of an impact of earth. Good characters, some good moral lessons, some profanity but nothing ultra offensive. Good enough to watch again and again."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this one,"Tea Leoni was bad. The movie plot was bad. Everything (except the last few minutes where the Liberty was knocked down by the waves) was perfect to watch if you've been suffering from insomnia. Armageddon was much, much better than this one."
1,Cheesy Impact,"This movie was terrible. It built up all this emotional stuff just to get your tear ducts going. I thought it was soooo cheesy. I felt exploited. At least with Armageddon, I knew it was a Bruckheimer with all the macho stuff and the great explosions. This movie started out to be serious and then melted into runny cheese."
4,Deep Enough.,"As far as disaster films go, this is one of the best. The characters have a little more depth than your usual catastrophe cardboard cutouts and are played with conviction by a fine cast. What good's a disaster if you don't really feel for the folks the disaster is happening to. Unlike most other big budget disaster blockbusters, DEEP IMPACT has a decent script that takes itself seriously. Add the cast, assured direction by MIMI LEDER, and some great fx visuals, and the end result is an extreemly enjoyable thrill ride that keeps head and heart intact. It's amazing how this movie gets so much slack when most others in the genere are far inferior (i.e. ARMAGEDDON, DAY AFTER TOMORROW, etc.)."
2,Too many french horns,"Get out your hankies. Saccharin-drenched noble french horns overdone to the max. Some good acting, lots of bad writing. Believability absent. Maybe a good kids' movie. boooo...."
2,I cried twice,"Firstly when young 'Bill' spots what any baboon can see is a comet but he calls it a 'star'!, for Heaven's sake had me in hysterics. Further along when one of his goonish classmates announces to the assembly that Bill willl now get a 'lot of sex' is when I cried ""Who's responsible for this mess! - I've wasted money renting this video!"" Scriptwriters/director have allowed too much nonsense detract from a very frightening theme. A pity that the megabucks involved aren't instead spent on real comet/asteroid detection and research."
2,Too Short,"It's not a bad movie, but it didn't even bring me close to tears...or even make me sniffle. At barely two hours, it tries to cover too much. Everyone raves about how much more character depth Deep Impact had than Armegeddon. At least Armageddon gave you a chance to get to know the characters before they got smashed to jelly or blown up. At the end of the movie I was more enthralled by the tidal wave than the people screaming. Instead of going, ""Run!! Run!!"" I was like, ""Wow!! Look at the size of that sucker!! Maybe it'll wipe out the 106th Congress!""Physics and realism aside, Armageddon wins this contest easily."
4,Great Blu-ray transfer! Still holds up!,"Although this movie is now over 10 years old, it still is as captivating as ever. Deep Impact premiered in theatres along the same time asArmageddonwith a similar premise. This film, however, has more heart and feels less like a summer blockbuster. Add to that Morgan Freeman portraying the President, and you have a total package! The transfer looks perfect and the acting is superb. Only a few onscreen moments date this film: specifically the technology the characters use. Check it out to see Elijah in his pre-The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray] career!"
1,I COULD DO BETTER IN MY BATH!!!!!!,"DEEP IMPACT, THE NAME IS CRAP FOR STARTERS. HOW ABOUT: WHAT IMPACT, THE TIDAL WAVE I WOULD ADMIT WAS PRETTY ERM......LITTLE . OH NO THIS TIDAL WAVE IS GOING TO DESTROY THE EARTH , WELL WAIT A MINUTE, WE'LL FLY INTO THE ASTEROID AND GET SCHOOLS NAMED AFTER US. HATS OFF TO WHOEVER ADDED THAT LINE. I MEAN COME ON THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE NEW GENERATION OF TOP QUALITY FILM ENTERTAINMENT, I WENT TO THE CINEMA TO SEE THAT AND NEARLY CRIED, NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FILM, I HAD TO PAY MONEY WAS THE THING THAT GOT THE TEAR DUCTS TWINGING. BUT I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE WORSE THEY COULD TAKE OUT A SEQUEL. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
1,Really Bad,I think this movie could have done a lot better. Armaggedon is WAY better!! I mean It doesn't have ANY Humor in it. I wish I could give it 0 stars!
1,Don't see it.,I hated it. IT sucked. I don't recomend this movie to others. I never want to watch this movie ever again in my whole entire life. I don't like it because the people are stupid. No one watch this dumb movie. Why didn't they just ram into it in the first place. Die you dumb movie.
1,The worst movie of all time.,"i have never seen such a failure on screen, it was so outlandishly overrated it was sick. I liked it better when it was called Independence Day."
1,too much sappy hollywood,Just rented this movie last night and couldn't believe i actually sat through the entire thing. First off they break the movie up into WAY too many substories to solve in 2 hours. The scenes where people act nobly become so cheesey that by the end of the movie you want the world destroyed. Not only was it too sappy and mushy but they make an issue of launching hundreds of missles at the comets and then don't even include a scene showing it. As unbelievable as I thought Armageddon was it was still a hundred times more enjoyable than this movie. It makes me wonder why they bothered with last minute lovey dovey additions to Armageddon so it wouldn't be only an action movie. Deep Impact has enough mushy fluff for every hollywood movie for about the next 5 years. Basically you've probably figured out that I think it's an awful disappointment from Dreamworks and that it's not worth the time.
3,DEEP IMPACT GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS NOT SO GOOD SUBPLOTS,"I both saw DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON on viedo and I liked ARMAGEDDON better than DEEP IMPACT and here's why. I found that DEEP IMPACT focused too much on soap opera diaolouges such as the story of ELIJHA""S WOOD""S character and TEA LEONI""S as well. I felt that those subplots took away a lot from the fantastic special effects in the movie. Another thing I found unbelivable was that if scientists knew a mile high TIDAL WAVE was heading twoard the coast of the eastern seaboard. I would hope that they and our goverment would do everything possible to move people out of harm's way. Anyway I liked DEEP IMPACT for it's effects not it's story I kinda wished it was more like ARMAGEDDON instead foucsing more on action on action not soap opera subplots."
2,"Bad movie, good actors.","Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall come out ok in this movie, but they can not make an overall bad movie much better. The only people that can really enjoy this movie are from the US, it's far too patriotic."
2,i prefer armageddon because...,"...if you are gonna have a film about an ELE, with the slightlymore serious approach that covers the sort of lottery in thisone (which all seems perfectly believable), you ought to havesome emotional impact to the storymaybe it's been been too long since i saw it, but it just seemedlike no one in the film really cared about what was going tohappen. seemed a little odd to me..."
1,No Impact,The acting was bad. The special effects were bad. The plot dragged. There were no suspenseful points at all. Armaggeddon rules. End of story.
1,Excruciating,"This film starts out so slowly, and with so little energy, that I started praying for the asteroid to make a surprise appearance. Once things started happening, the movie only got worse. Characters behaved strangely and stupidly, the dialogue was cheesy, there was absolutely NO dramatic tension, and the acting was, at best, subpar. The ludicrous ending at least provided a laugh or two. Stay away!"
3,Region??,"What region is this disc? Region 1 or All Region? It is unacceptable that Amazon so often fail to write what Region the discs are in, as the All Region titles are for sale across the world (why otherwise have All Region discs in the first place? I do have 2001, Shining and Blade Runner the 5 disc set, as they are All Region, and I live in Europe.So please, anyone, which region is Deep Impact? And Contact, for that matter-"
1,THIS IS NOT THE REAL DEEP IMPACT,"Don't be fooled by the similar looking cover, this is actually the adult German film about relationships. While the ""impact"" is especially ""deep"" it is intensly boring, and the women don't shave their pits. It's a slow paced romance between an uber-leftenant in post-WWII Czeczhlosclovakia, and a chaste young country fraulien. Not bad if you like that stuff."
1,Low impact,"I totally waste my time, and money for watching this movie. It is the same as Armageddon, but the quality & especial effects are not perfect. I recommend you not to watch this movie."
5,"One word sums up the entire movie ""Awsome""","I saw this movie on VHS and wish I had seen it on a wide screen to take in the extreme video graphic special effects. There is a website up by the makers of the movie also. The site follows the story and makes the video more worth watching. the spfx were flawless and the actors were very believable. especially Morgan Freeman as the president. I have watched this movie several times since purchase and enjoy every time I turn it on. We need more like this, that sit you on the edge of your seat and keep you there. C. Kitchell"
3,Good as good does,Movie has more depth than cartoonish 'Armagedon' although all members of both productions are generally good to excellent. These comments (negative for 'Deep Impact' & positive for 'Armagedon') lead me to believe that most women didn't care for 'Deep Impact'. Proof of why God put female parts on women-So men would talk to them
5,"This one made me, a Man's Man, a little shaky","Although, it can be called a Sci-Fi movie, this one made me think, ""This could really happen"" making choices between life and death. The president, (Morgan Freeman) was forced to make choices that affected the life of every American--Who would live and who would die. RENT THIS MOVIE!! Guaranteed to make you think and possibly wipe your eye."
3,Much better than Armaggedon....MUCH,"There must be two kinds of people in the world...those that like Deep Impact, and those that like Armaggedon. I thought Armaggedon was the worst film of the past two decades. If i could give that one minus five stars I would!Deep Impact is fairly good. Sure it has cliches, etc. But it is understated, if anything, and has wonderful visuals and a good musical score. I enjoyed it much more than, say, Independence Day.Armaggedon, on the other hand, was tripe in every way. Bruce Willis should be ashamed.I wish they would release Ike the War Years with Duvall. In that he was superlative."
4,Good Suspense,"Morgan Freeman is excellent. I would see almost anything that this actor is involved with. The best Afro American actor next to Denzel Washington. Robert Duvall is also very good. :)Some of the acting is weak, but it gets you to ask the question...""What if?"""
2,"Neither Deep, Nor did it have any impact.","Long, boring, self serious without any believable characters. The writers should have taken some clues from people's behavior during the Cuban Missile Crisis to determine what would happen in this situation. At least Armageddon knew it was stupid. The people who made this movie should have ripped off more from On The Beach and less from When Worlds Collide. Funniest bit from the movie: The Statue of Liberty getting knocked over by a giant tidal wave, causing several members in the audience at the theater where I saw it to shout out Charlton Heston's famous last line from Planet of the Apes. I also found it odd that Morgan Freeman's final speech in Deep Impact was parodied more than one year earlier in Tim Burton's somewhat funnier Mars Attacks!."
1,Big fan of Elijah Wood,I have watched this film for five times. The reason was not the movie- actually it was pretty boring- it was Elijah Wood...
1,armageddon without any story,From the very beginning this movie was awful. The story line is very weak. The directore attempts to build tension by showing how the blow the comet. What took armageddon over an hour to do they compressed into six minutes tops. Then they shift to who's going to die and who will live when the comet will hit. The graphics are pretty good for when one piece hits. I especially love watching people attempting to outrun a wave moving at 1100 mph. Pure junk through and through. Rent but don't ever buy
1,Only one thing could have saved this movie...,"If the larger rock had the decency to crash down and finish the film. The acting was terrible, even Morgan Freeman couldn't save it. Mainly because he is givin 3 minutes of real screen time, and one of the worst monologues in history."
3,Well....,"I thought this movie was boring. Of course, thats just my opinion, I could be wrong. Too much crying, for one thing. The asteroids gonna hit, get over it. I like the fact that the director was a woman (they usually do movies like this, who else would have a black president in thier movies) plus the fact that it was more realistic than that comedy (did I say ""comedy?"") Armageddon. I kinda have more respect for this movie, but I did think it was boring and overrated. Course, like I said, that just my opinion, I could be wrong. I am yet to see a movie in which the bad guys (aliens, asteroid, terrorists, prank callers, the like) actually win anyways back to this movie, good job!"
2,Save your money,"Even more disappointing than Armageddon, this waste of 2 hours didn't even have decent special effects. How can ""Hope Survive"" when we have such hopeless ""entertainment."" Freeman and Duval should be ashamed to have appeared in this film, let alone be listed in the credits. Tia Leone's lackluster acting was in keeping with this effortless production. Michael J. Fox was right: TV writers today- as bad as TV is- are doing a better job than the silver screen guild. Sad indeed."
4,Old Time Favorite is in Blu-Ray,"Really love the movie and with Blu-Ray, nothing makes me happier to see my favorite over & over again. Great purchased, i recommend."
4,Its a disaster!,"Well, this movie is another one in my top ten disaster movies list. The world is going to be destroyed by another meteor, ala Armageddon. This a disaster film ""the world is comming to an end"" The special effects are there, we have heroics, and heroism. This movie is about hope, as we get to peer into our players lives, and see how they react, and deal with the information. This movie is a worthwile investment for any collection."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever,I wish I could give this zero stars. I feel sorry for any person that even remotely enjoyed this disaster/ously movie. Morgan you should be ashamed of yourself. Mystery Science Theater can't wait.
2,Does it wrong,"This film has a great premise and exciting opening - a forgotten discovery of a coming impact. But then it cools down and goes into a belabored series of vignettes about the characters...however it forgets the central point. The Disaster which only happens 25 minutes from the end!! And then when we really want to see courage, etc, it ends as suddenly as it starts.These filmmakers need to go back to the Irwin Allen classics like the Towering Inferno. The disaster begins right from the get go and keeps worsening, trapping characters, creating heroes. This film lags because there is no disaster to ""impact"" the characters."
5,"Armageddon, but better","This has most of the excitement of Armageddon but has a plot that you actually care about. You get to go through a range of emotions other than just cool special effects. It's more believable and more realistic which allows you to actually pay attention to the character development. In the end, it is about the same thing as Armageddon and though it does what it does well, nobody's going to win anything for this movie. But as entertainment value for an evening (or many - I've watched it over a dozen times and still love it), it's completely worth it!"
2,more action needed,"for a blockbuster its marginal at best. more focus should have been paid to the comet.and its devastation after impact, duvall and freeman soild efforts. rest of cast forgetable!!!!!!!!!"
5,this movie was soooo cool,"this movie was excellent!!! It deserves all 5 stars. It may not be as great as Armageddon, but the graphics and such were compelling. I didn't even get up to go to the bathroom!"
4,Tons better than Armageddon,"When I went to see Deep Impact, I expected a lot of screaming and shouting and stuff blowing up, the way there was later in Armageddon. Instead, there was an intellectual, emotional plot that made you think. This movie also provided a much more realistic view of how people would react. The movie itself was more plausible (Since when are there asteroids the size of Texas?) Deep Impact was much better than Armageddon!"
5,WOW!!!!!,"As far as the movie goes, the summary says it all. I loved this movie. I just wanted to say a word about the programming. First of all, the movie takes a while to boot up on my machine. Secondly, why is this a dual layer disk? It is an average length movie with only 1 screen format on it. It has no frills, only 2 trailers. Why the dual layers? If anyone has the answer please email me. Thanks"
3,Good but not the best,"I thought that movie was well written and it had decent special effects, but it's lacking if you're are looking for a typical blockbuster-special effects movie. The story may seem similiar to Armageddon, but the focus is more on what would happen if people became a victim of this disaster. The movie has some the best actors (Freeman, Duvall), but just because you have liked these actors' past films does not guarantee you will like this one. I thought the acting was great. The only thing this movie suffers from is jumping from one scenerio to the next in extremely fast manner. This can be frustrating because you want to know more about each scene but you're left blank, and some things are never answered. Armageddon may have been less mature, but, hey, that what makes money. If you liked Armageddon, give ""Deep Impact"" a try. You might like it."
3,Deep Impact = Realism Aramagedon = Special effects,"If you like drama and realism, then Deep Impact is the film to watch. If you like special effects and action then Armagedon is the clear choice. I think neither film really hits the mark. If only the strengths of both films could be combined."
5,"Spectacular, took my breath away. A MUST SEE!!!!!!","This movie is spectacular. The special affects are dazzaling. But this movie is more than that. It has many sub-plots that are dramatic. I know that this is great movie because it is the only one that has been able to make me cry. For teens to love one another that much is mind-boggling. The plot with Tea Leoni and her parents is one that any child could appreciate. All the actors give a stellar porformance. Thiss movie is dramatic, heart-wrenching, realistic, and just all around marvelous. Anyone who has ever loved movies should see this one. This movie set a standard that Hollywood needs to live up to."
1,Typically American we-will-save-the-world film,"If anybody told me the topic of the film before I saw it, I could have guessed 95% of what will happen. Predictable as it is, it offers no excitement whatsoever. And I also think that the Black president is just too much. I would like to see that happen! Everything else is just like I wrote in my summary: America is the saviour of the Earth (especially the incredibly intelligent president), no one else can do anything and is just standing by waiting for the miraculous saving. I am just surprised that the Russian member of the space ship crew was not ridiculed as they usually are in American movies. If you really have to (somebody is pointing a gun at you)go and see this ""film""."
2,Quite stupid,"Much of this movies does not make logical sense.1. Why not use a phone instead of driving?2. Why was the boy that discovered the comet saved? The movie did not show any instance showing that he was smarter than any of the other students in the class3. Why was the senator / president / fbi so stupid? They should have known that the news reporter knew nothing about the comet.4. The drilling team should have accounted for more fuel.Overall it is mildly entertaining, but painful to watch."
1,Extremely disappointing,"The premise of the movie is frightening and captivating at the same time. I expected tremendous special effects, action and drama from a panicked public and government. Instead I got an overated snore fest.Don't waste your time."
1,zzzzzz boring and hardly compelling,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thats my reacion to this film. I expected a lot more from this movie then some depressing borefest. Its hard to believe that they refused to send nukes up to hit this rock as contigency plan C through Z. Obviously a politically correct self righteous narrow minded film crew made this movie. Not to mention that the special effects [were bad]
2,"Get ""Armageddon"", please.","I will only give you three lines to describe the flick: a negro american president - people being warned of the ominous danger several months before the impact and a national lottery to choose the ones who will go to the ""Noah's Ark"" (instead of preparing the whole thing secretly and putting aside the normal citizen as it is and as it must be) - Would any person with a minimum sense of reality believe that? - Finally, an unnecessary dawdling of a tedious plot threaded with unsubstantial clichéed characters following the most banal and predictable unpredictability. Make yourself a favor and get Armaggedon, a western-in-space that will make you think of a post-modern version of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""The Magnificent Seven"". More fun, more epics, and --being a scifi-opera--, more credible by far than this ""Flat Impact""."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"Deep Impact is terrible in every way, a cinematic sharp stick to the eye. I can forgive the lame special effects but the overall mawkish tone made me want to vomit. Truly awful."
1,disgraceful,"We have here a movie that epitomizes everything that is wrong with Hollywood movies: sickening sentimentality, gung-ho patriotic drivel, the completely telegraphed happy ending, and such a persistent effort to be as PC as possible that it paradoxically becomes stereotypical. Did I mention the bad acting and dialogue and the stupid plot? What is with these 'saving the world at the last possible second' movies? Please, can we rub out the disaster movie forever? If I see another bad actor outrunning a fireball, tidal wave, or tornado I'm going to smash my TV set."
1,Fanciful Rubbish.,"This film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes. It is as scientifically realistic as the Roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a Geico commercial.Out of the hundreds of films that I have watched in my lifetime, of every stripe and quality, this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that I began fast-forwarding through simply so that I could see the meteor hit and make the big wave. If this film were a sexual encounter, both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay.Life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film."
3,"Good movie, not exactly what I expected...","I was looking for a disaster flick, and got a human interest story instead. Try as I might, though, I can't completely trash this movie, as this is a case where good acting comes to the rescue of piecemeal editing, and blatantly misleading advertising."
5,Excellent much more realistic than Armageddon,"This is an outstanding movie, very true to life and very realistic. Morgan Freeman is excellent, he can be our President any time."
4,Deep impact,Very good movie dipicks how one migth receivethe news regarding the end of the world as weknow it. Some what advanced.
3,it's ok,"Deep Impact is a good disaster movie, it has a scene wherethey pick those who would be save, Similar to the old1951 movie (when Worlds Collide)they called the ark but there are remakes of some these old george pal movies like thetime machine,ok now I like to see them do a remake of the 1951(when Worlds Collide)."
3,Good but very similar to Armageddon,"This movie was a very good movie but was very similar to Armageddon. I think this movie had more heart to it to. If you want action and lots of special effects, get Armageddon. If you want love, heart, and just a great movie, get this!"
4,Not the Deep Impact I expected,"Deep Impact was not the movie I expected after the first time I watched it. After seeing the cover art of the video box, I thought this must be a movie filled with special effects, showing the destruction of the planet after a large asteroid impacts. Instead, deep impact takes on a different meaning. It doesn't refer to the deep impact of an asteroid (which is really a comet instead) but refers to the deep impact this event has on human society. What you get with Deep Impact is an emotional story with a lot of meaning. Don't expect a whole lot of special effetcs until the very end, only a minute or two. If you prefer a movie with more action, Armageddon may be the one to watch. But if you want a movie with a lot of heart, Deep Impact my friend."
3,Deep Impact is entertaining.,"This movie gives you the entertainment you want but if you're a real action fan you really won't get it until the very end of the movie. However, it has great special effects."
2,Mediocre disaster film,"Tea Leoni gets the Ben Affleck award for acting malpractice. The woman cannot act, and why anyone would give her the starring role in any film is a complete mystery. This woman not only cannot act, at least in this film she appears to be stoned on some powerful drug. And I am being kind. (Very kind.) Granted that she is an ectomorphic blonde, but come on. There are others out there with true acting ability. Leoni has none.Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall save this film from being an utter turkey, but only by a slight margin. Freeman as the President of the United States is very, very good, and he is really the savior of this otherwise awful film. This one is a stinker, but the special effects just barely make it watchable to the end. I never tire of watching New York City get destroyed. This saves the film, just as the destruction of New York has saved several other otherwise horrible films. Only barely though."
4,"I liked it, but some of you may like Armagedon more","Not enough time and too many plot lines killed this movie.First we have the plot line of a High School student that discovers a comet that will kill us allSecond we have an ammeter reporter that blows the cover on the whole thingThird we have the reactions of a president and how he deals with the coming crisis safeguarding his people and suchlikeFourth we have a mission in space to go and destroy the big bad comet before it kills us all.While individually these plot lines are good and the ending is satisfying I thought that they all rushed together sometimes the action was too quick sometimes it was too slow.This is one of those movies that could have been great if it could have known what it wanted and had an actual plan of attack. As it is the film sort of stumbles about haphazardly with moments of real insight breaking in often.Overall-Good movie if you like drama, but don't confuse this with Armageddon it is not a comedy."
3,The Mars & Venus of Disaster Movies,"The only interesting thing I noticed about the two meteorite disaster films that came out the same year, DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON, was how they differed.(I didn't see either one in a theatre since just about everyone told me that, if I saw the trailer, I saw the coolest parts of both movies).ARMAGEDDON is a meteorite disaster flick from a guy's point of view. The underdog rascals are sent into space to destroy the meteorite after much testosterone antics and posturing. The chick (Liv Tyler) is hot. It's a cowboy enterprise.DEEP IMPACT is the same movie but from a woman's point of view. The world is about ready to end, but Tea Leoni tries to come to grips with her troubled relationship with her dad. People hug, make sacrifices, deal with emotions.To be honest, I liked DEEP IMPACT better. Even though it was the more laid back of the two, it was also more thoughtful and interesting. But that ARMAGEDDON opening did kick butt."
2,not even close to armegedon as far as all round movie.,what can i say i seen armegeddon first blew this deep impact away.but must admit that tidal wave seens was well done.
5,Great movie.,"One of the best movies I've seen this year. Compared to this, ""Armageddon"" was pure trash."
2,Very disappointing!,"""Deep Impact"" was very cheesy! The best scene in the movie was the tidal wave, which you saw in the previews. ""Armageddon"" was better because there was humor and it wasn't as corny. ""Deep Impact"" was pretty bland, but if you like commet movies, try it out."
5,Really dressed up the front end of my vehicle,"High quality chrome look and feel and was easy to install. I also purchased the matching Window Replectors as well. With both accessories, it really dressed up my vehicle and made it look more expensive. Ended up purchasing them for my other vehicle as well."
3,self-indulgent,"This book has a premise--that fairy folk are interfering in the world of humans--and not much else. The plot takes fully half the book's length to get going, and results in only one real event. That would probably be okay, if the rest of the reader's time were spent with the fairies, or immersed in Welsh culture, or in historical flashbacks. Sadly, though, we are treated to the dreary company of three not-very-likeable women: an insufferable young artisan, her neurotic mother, and the mother's dull friend. If, however, you have read and liked this book, I'd like to recommend Kathryn Davis' ""The Walking Tour."" Also set in Wales, with a slight element of the supernatural, and a bit more life to it."
3,Clasp problems,"I like the looks of this and it seems to keep time well. However, the pin attaching the clasp to rest of the links keeps falling out and I've had to have it fixed 3 times."
3,Already yellowed,"I got this watch one week ago. It looks good in the pictures with white and black squares and that's why I liked it so much. I read the review and found that the white squares can get yellowed over time. HOWEVER, what I got is a brand new watch with already ""yellowed"" ""white"" squares... Actually, the small white squares within the black ones have the same white color as shown in the pictures but the bigger ""white"" squares have ""yellowed"" color. I am disappointed and don't quite understand why the watch I got is like this."
3,Silver Solstice,"Music was very good. ""DVD"" suggests video. At end of DVD music were some mediocre still pictures of the Cathedral. Bonus DVD not much of a bonus."
2,Grey Solstice-DVD RipOff,"I was very disappointed in this CD/DVD of the 25th Anniversary Winter Solstice Celebration. The CD's are very good. But the DVD is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I was expecting to see the concert recording on the DVD, this was not the case. The DVD consisted of music and still life shots of the concert, which I feel was a rip off to fans of Paul Winter Consort. Why couldn't they have added the recording...I purchased this for my Christmas Eve celebration with the expectation of viewing the concert at St John the Divine, instead I got photographs. BIG RIPOFF. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I did not expect this from the Paul Winter Consort group, I thought they were above ripping off their fans, but I guess not."
3,"Funny, but not as good as others","I am a fan of the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books, and I love how she relates to children, but this book does not show much of that. This book mostly shows parents at their wits' end with their kids, and then magic pills or powders that ""cure"" them.While admittedly ridiculous and full of good, memorable scenes, this book is not up to the same level as ""Mrs. Piggle Wiggle"" or ""Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm"". In those books, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle uses a love and understanding of children, plus reverse psychology, to bring about changed behaviors. No magic dust. Love, patience, and understanding.My favorite cure in this book was the bullying cure: substituting leadership for bullying. But I think it's better to do it without the pills."
5,Love Mrs. Piggle Wiggle books,Great read a loud for my third graders....been reading Mrs. Piggle Wiggle for over twenty years now. Children love to read about other children being bad...and parents love to read Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's cures.
3,Intriguing or maddening,"The title is not explained through 80% of the book. This does make you want to read further. I look for historical romances with children in the storyline and in the child's depiction, Wolf does not disappoint, he is enjoyable to read about. The main characters are true to type, hero, heroine, stupid but evil protagonists. There is a death in the book that is somehow depicted in too brief a fashion, you feel the main characters are class conscious to their detriment. I wish the author would have made it an injury."
4,Very enjoyable,"Well thought out characters, snappy dialog, and a refreshingly different plot made this novel a very enjoyable read."
5,simple!....... necessary.....!,"i wonder how?, i wonder why?,this is the combination between, colors and lyrics, is expresive, natural, beautiful, all created by sam prekop.......I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!, i was waiting for this!simple but true!"
4,refreshing and unique,"I just bought this and have listened several times a day. It is like nothing I've ever heard before - I can float away with the sounds but also feel very alive and aware. It feels slightly Brazilian, very nature filled - as if the trees made music. Full of soft rhythms, dreamy, luscious, wonderfully intriguing melodies, gentle but works it's way into your soul as it sways. I'm so glad I was told about Sam."
4,Fine. Really fine.,Sam is a wonderous talent. This project whispers of past Sea and Cake without being overly indebted. This C.D. is fine. Really fine.
5,Powerful and Disturbing,"An amazing and brutal indictment of the cruelty that lies just beneath the stultifying nature of American family values. Difficult to watch, but brilliant in its gradual escalation through ideas of discipline and parental/guardian control until one by one, each new measure is presented as reasonable, as okay, as not so bad, and then segues out of control into heightened levels of cruelty and horror. Had I not read ""When Rabbit Runs,"" I doubt if I would have believed that this level of child abuse could happen, whether in the fifties, the eighties, or now. But it does, and this movie focuses on it."
4,Ketchum's Girl Next Door Movie,"I'm not gonna bother with some overly detailed commentary or opinions, everyone's is different. This movie is well-made, the acting is done fine, despite what some reviews say. It's brutally real and depressing to the point that it's almost painful to watch (especially when the final lines are crossed). A few loopholes that make you go ""why didn't they/he just do this or that...."" But in the end, you WILL feel hollow. This isn't the kind of movie you expect out of some 'genre' or look for in the store; but it will leave something behind inside that you will never quite get rid of again. Based lightly around a real event just makes that fact stronger."
2,Problems with the way filmed,I watched this movie one night and it started out promising enough with the 2 girls going to live with their aunt and making some friends. There was good character development and the story was interesting. The problem with this movie isn't so much the content which has been in god knows how many horror movies but the fact that when the disturbing part of the movie begins you can't tell what is going on due to inadequate lighting. I'd normally give this 1 star but because of the promising start I'll give it 2 stars
5,Unforgettable and Painfully Powerful,"I walked out of the theater numb and shaking. Very skillfully done, it was a horrifying look at severe child abuse with wonderful acting and full of tension. A third of the people in the theater where I saw this film at were crying or in tears as we left the building. Knowing it was based on a true story made it even more tragic. An emotional rollercoaster ride if you are brave enough to watch. You'll never forget it. Highly recommended."
5,Brutal...,"Not knowing anything about the book I walked in to this expecting a fun and creepy horror film. What I got was easily one of the most unforgettable film experiences I've ever had. Gruesome and disturbing without ever being trashy. As a matter of fact, the most amazing thing about the film is how great the direction and performances are. The woman who plays Ruth creates one of the most frightening monsters in film history. Hats off to the rest of the cast and crew for making a film that's going to take me a while to shake off. I'm not gonna go into details of the story. All I'm saying is SEE IT. You won't be sorry you did."
5,disturbing,"Horror movies are my favorites......not really sure what genre this would fit in--maybe TRUE HORROR?? It was very hard to watch, but I couldn't turn it off.I have several movies on the Holocaust (Nazis, Concentration Camps, etc) and I've even been to Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Buchenwald. The Girl Next Door is off the charts creepy to me. The really sad thing is, this stuff happens daily---somewhere! If you're really squimmish, this is NOT the movie for you."
3,Watch An American Crime instead.,"I'm not saying that The Girl Next Door was bad. It was a well done take on a horrible, horrible situation. I'd say I enjoyed it but while you can appreciate a movie that takes on a real life issue like this, it doesn't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy (actually it was more like queasy and tense). An American Crime feels more, well, the only word I can really think of is ""productive."" The lead-in and the ending of the other movie make it feel more complete."
2,Disturbing but ultimately hollow,"I won't rehash the plot since many have done so here. Suffice it to say that this film's subject mater is disturbing, but there is such a lack of developed characters that I found many of their actions inconceivable. Yes, this is based on actual events, but without motivated characters I sat there wondering why anyone did what he or she did. I'm sure the book delves into the psyches of the participants more fully, but I couldn't help thinking that if the ""moral"" boy next door had just said, ""Mom, Dad, I need you to come next door because our neighbor has a tied up, stripped, and tortured young girl in the basement,"" the film would have lasted about one-half an hour. I mean, c'mon! the door was never even locked."
1,BOORING,"My god what a waste of time. Who ever said this was POWERFUL and INTENSE has a LOT to learn about movies. This movie was so lame and utterly UNWATCHABLE do to the boreing plot line, NOT because it was a powerfully made movie. It was painful to watch because it seemed to be made for tv. LAME, wish I had my 2 hrs back, what a waste"
1,disturbing!!!!,I was absolutely disgusted with the film. Don't read the other reviews as I did. After I watched this movie I actually threw it in the garbage. This is just another one of Stephen King's warped sick mind.
3,The Girl Next Dood (movie),I should see the movie THEN read the book. I guess I get spoiled and have come to expect more having read the book first. Not a bad movie but I thought it should have followed the book a little closer.
4,Faithful Adaptation,"Having read THE GIRL NEXT DOOR by Jack Ketchum a year or two ago, I was mentally prepared for this one going into it. Anyone like me who has daughters is more than likely to feel more than a bit gut-wrenched after this. But aside from the extreme content, this film was actually well made. The aunt's slow almost unnoticeable descent into madness was expertly done and the film was not watered down, but rather captured the theme of the loss of innocence and the horrors of a mass hysteria of sorts.It truly is mind boggling and depressing to dwell on the fact that this is based on a true event, and this is probably not the best date film or family night motion picture event. Get ready for some serious disturbia. The acting is great by some and not-so-great by others, but overall it was pulled off well and is a must-see for any Ketchum fans and those who enjoy real life extreme crime thrillers ."
2,Hallmark movie of the week with a dark twist.,"The story certainly is a strong one, to the book author's merrit. However I find the execution of the film to be very academic and has thus somewhat of a made for TV feel. The cinematography, editing and soundtrack don't offer any suprises. Production and sound design are acceptable. Unfortunately I have to admit that I wasn't sold on some of the kid performances.It seems to me that nobody - despite the heavy subject matter - tried to push the limits. Which is certainly possible without having to show additional violence as the most talented directors have proven us. Was the main objective to produce a film that is in the end an easy sell? Please note the Starz network logo in the beginning of the film who took over distribution for the US market.With an edgier take on the art direction and a visually more compelling director this could have been a very powerful film."
3,Humans are vile.,"I love horror movies, so I have seen some pretty sick stuff. With that said, The Girl Next Door is the most horrifying movie I have ever seen. As one reviewer said, I wish I could wash my brain with bleach. Knowing it is based on a true story and it happened to children, really made this painful. The horrible abuse these girls suffered made me fast forward through a lot of the movie. The acting, direction, cinematography is all very well done, and it's a solid film, but certainly nothing I ever want to see again. It has stayed with me for quite a few days now."
2,Disappointed,"Most of the reveiws for this film were a little misleading. The film could have been absolutely shocking if not produced for sixteen year olds. Having said that, the film was disturbing because it was based on real events. The violence was all off screen or left to your imagination. If you want to be upset without seeing what your upset about, go for it. A good film waisted on age restrictions."
4,What's sick is: It's a true story.,"Rented it off iTunes. This is a very well done depiction of one of the worst crimes ever committed. It's a true story; the fact that a anyone, much less a woman, a MOTHER even, could do this to another person is simply disgusting. Add that to the list of things I wish I didn't know."
3,"Good movie making, bad movie","It is not like a typical sexploitation movie since it does have good technical and production values. There is good acting. The ""bad"" person is really bad and the actress has done a fantastic job of making her bad. I am surprised she wasn't so type-cast as to be unable to get any other acting jobs. Having said that, the movie didn't need to be made nor does it need to be viewed. Movies such as this depress the soul and since this one is made so well, it really depresses the soul. I do not tend to be a prude but this one was too much for me. I give it three stars only for the quality of film-making."
5,PEOPLE!! THIS IS ONE CRAZY MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE IS SO SHOCKING , I DUNNO WHAT TO PUT DOWN ABOUT IT ....."
2,Hell by daylight,"I read the book and my imagination went wild. I imagined everything so much uglier and darker as it is in the movie.The movie is very colourful and has lots of light. There is tension, but not enough, also the mother who gave birth to 3 children still looks like a beauty and not touched by the hard life, which makes it not so believable.My advice buy the book, it is well written and gives you the terror you want. A Disturbing Masterpiece! Even my brother was reading it and he hates reading!"
2,pure trash,"This is the most offensive movie I've seen in my life. Like porn, it has no plot and it's driven by the sick exploitative acts performed on the girl. I admit I have a sadistic side and enjoy sick and disturbing movies but the sheer inhumanness and depravity of this garbage just made me very angry."
5,"I never read this book, and after seeing this movie, I never","will. The acting was very well done, especially the child actors. I was suprised to see Grant Show from Melrose Place fame, he did a good job. I've never heard of the Sylvia Likens case. That this was true story makes it even more horrible to watch. Not for children or people with weak stomachs. Very, very sad."
5,The Ultimate in Depravity,"I have seen a lot of horror movies. From the Guinea Pig Films to the best\worst in Euro-Asian-American shock cinema.There are few, if any movies out there than can reach such a level in depravity as the Girl Next Door. This movie based on the true story is so horrifying, you will wish you never saw it. That being said, the film is remarkably well done. From the acting the production values, to the care of leaving the gore one frame away.For those that enjoyed Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer - The Girl Next Door is the new standard. Nothing, but nothing out there is more horrifying than this film."
5,The aftermath is very distrubing,"I am going to make this as short as possible. This movie will catch you off guard. The movie starts off like just a normal view, kids playing, just a normal atmosphere. But as time goes on it gets more intense and by the end of this movie, it is just disturbing. This is based on a true story. I watched this movie about three months ago, and when I think of the girl next door or even run across it in my dvd collection, I pause and still get a strange uncomfortable feeling. This is one of those stories you will never forget that stays with you after the fact. Don't get me wrong this is a very good movie. But if you are overly sensitive to children, my advice is don't watch it."
4,Daring Film,"This film is both morally and mentally disturbing. The subject matter is such a sensitive topic to people, This film captures what some youth actually have to live with. In a way this film is similar to ""Funny Games"". The story revovles around a sick mother and her children that are very abusive in sexual manner to her children. Torturing, humilating and rape. Disturbing indeed, This film has some hardcore scenes. Hardcore as in wrong and disturbing. Such as the womans teenage son raping a local teenage girl. Most people will be completly repulsed by this film, But for those that are fans of psychological horror or crime should watch it.The film is very familiar to the book, But if the subject of children being subjected to this type of these things. Don't bother with this movie.Recommended for those that like these films:""In A Glass Cage""""Salo""""Apt Pupil"""
5,Jaw-dropping,"First of all, every one of the children in this film are phenomenal young actors! The directing is outstanding. Very well paced too. There is no way you can view this film and not feel some of your strongest emotions. Convincing? So brutal, but this is so realistically done that you can't help but imagine yourself getting your hands on some of these characters. Excellent film making."
2,"Powerful, moving Movie...Weak Blu-Ray Release","I won't go into the specifics of the movie itself since most people know what it's about by now. My review will focus solely on the Blu-Ray release. While the disc shows a stunning picture, that's all there is. No extras, no subtitles, not even a menu! I thought something was wrong when I put it in and the movie started right up. Subs wouldn't be a bad thing for this movie since most of the dialogue between the two main children is either whispered or spoken while crying/in pain. Sometimes, it's just hard to understand what they're saying.The DVD version is loaded with extras: 2 Audio Commentaries, Interview with Cast & Crew, The Making-of featurette, Trailer and Screenplay (DVD-ROM). This is one of those few instances where alot more thought and work went into the standard-definition DVD than the High-definition Blu-Ray. Just buy the DVD and use the upscale part of your Blu-Ray player. You'll be alot happier in the end."
2,"Review for ""The Girl Next Door""","This movie was more like a play with very NON Professional people trying to act. Other than that, you do get the idea of what Sylvia Marie Likens had to go through."
1,The Girl Next Door Horror,"After viewing this movie I vomitted. Depression took over for several days. This is an account of one of the most horrific TRUE stories in our lifetime. The story of Sylvia Likens in the 1950's in Indiana. She was tortured, raped, humiliated, and starved. Her battered body was used like a punching bag until she died. She died in the basement of a house where she was chained and tied up. Sylvia suffered every horror you can imagine one person committing against another. Shockingly, the group of young boys who violated her were allowed to continue until her death if they promised not to tell anyone else. Could your teenage son, brother, nephew, grandson, etc., be capable of these unspeakable violations of poor Sylvia? Or are you the one adult who encouraged this behavior? Do you know what is happening in your neighbors house? Be prepared to have your heart ripped."
2,a disqusting thing to see,"I do not condone any action with violence toward children. This is a fairly sanitized version of what happened. The sad thing is that children will be so very cruel to each other and especially toward someone who becomes marked as an outsider or target. This is called scapegoating. Children will know about dead bodies and bring friends and other back to see it.Finally, someone breaks and makes a phone call. Or perhaps a stranger wanders upon the body also. Yet this person makes a phone call.I would not buy a movie like this. I saw it at a friends house. I got up and left. It will be a cold day in a Christian Hell before I ever enter that Pastors house again.Instead of spending money on this movie, I would reccomend donating it toward a childrens shelter."
1,The Girl Next Door Movie.,"No Point in making a film like this? It glorifies, It does not bring Closure to the Likens and it is sick and it profits off of it for the sake of ""Shock""It's like watching Saw but on a REAL Level as it did it happen,You might as well have been in cahoots with the perps since your watching it. I saw it,I hated it. I didn't read the ""NOVEL"" nor Do I Plan to.The Movie was intentional I believe in not to bring awareness but as some sort of Beef against the 1950's. When The Film Stars the Narrator says something to that effect,and then on to the story, the fact that the narrator was such a COWARD and DID nothing, He Tried on a Small level BUT NOT ENOUGH,The Person deserves to live with Guilt for the rest of his life. Even As A Child myself I knew right from wrong,These Kids Were Monsters. I would have witnessed this I would Have told Everybody not just the neighbors and cops."
2,Only good part was the end....,"...when the evil old hag got beat to death with the little girl's crutch.That's the only scene that made this movie good.Although,I think a more gruesome death for that monster would have been better. ....just my opinion though."
4,They deliver!,"These stands are easy to use, lightweight as they say and do the job I want them to do.My only con is the links of the chain for the pin always break and you have to mend them all time. That means you always have to check on the pin when finished using the stands so as not to lose them.Other than the chain for the pins, they serve their purpose well."
4,Speaker stands,Very light but strong enough to do the job. I would recommend this item to others.Good product and good price
5,"Good stands, nice price",I had a pair of Samson stands for my moblie DJ business for about 5 years and they worked great. They can hold the weight of heavier speakers and are small and light to carry around. Bought a second pair to have with my second set of equipment.
3,"Average performances, only get it if inexpensive","I bought this for the music - specifically, Dishwalla, Brother Cane, and The Nixons. I don't care about the radio station on-air bits and probably won't ever listen to them. If you like any of the 90's rock bands here, it may be worth it to you. Every one is acoustic; some sound like they were in the radio station's studio, and others may have been pulled from existing live shows. Honestly, they're pretty average performances, so don't expect to be blown away...if you're a musician, you'll notice a number of mistakes throughout. I managed to get it new for $5 plus S&H...at that price, it was worth it for the three tracks that interested me in the first place. Any more expensive, and I probably would have been disappointed."
1,"The Radio Fools or ""The Stupid Suspects""","I don't like this CD. Why? Because of the stupid and cruel morons from the radio station who appear on it. A bunch of no class jerks. That Tina Louise call was below the belt. I wish she would called you morons every name in the book. Also, that ""letter to Miguel"" BS. What type of sick low life thinks that is funny? You do messy things to decent people on the air and then laugh about it. I hope you morons know that it's true, what comes around goes around. Hopefully you've all been fired by now. I have NOTHING against the recording artists who appear however, the music was good."
5,Touching Movie,This was a very touching movie. Appreciated the comedic aspects as well as the lessons and family values. Never give up! I loved it!
3,"Positive movie, positive actors","A Chicago Defender reporter completed an interview about the real Jasmine Plummer, and it's been sitting on the first page of Google for months, so I wondered what the popularity was about. But I'm not really into sports movies (mainly because I'm not into sports) and usually because it's about the same plot: undiscovered and previously untalented team who gets a star player and overcomes it all. So I never watched this movie. However, although this movie fit that same theme, I enjoyed the chemistry between KeKe Palmer playing Jasmine Plummer and Ice Cube's character. There were a few humorous scenes, and I respect the real Jasmine Plummer for overcoming the odds of being a bookworm and being so talented. The part about giving your father your hand was the best for me--great move. Overall, this movie was pretty good."
4,positive film for all ages,"Long shots is based on a true story of a run down town and a young lady that achieves confidence on the football field. Against all odds, the town as well as the girl learn to achieve simply by watching the girl overcome obstacles on the football field. This movie is good for all ages to see due to it is positive and it shows that anything can be done if you put the proper effort into it. The movie displays decent acting, humor and drama. You won't be disappointed with watching this film."
2,"Bought phone as it had good reviews, but I'm not happy.","I bought the phone about 2 weeks ago and I am not happy with it! It keeps dropping calls, sometimes it doesn't ring, it only holds a charge for about 12 hours and it has to be charged again. I have to keep turning it off and on to get it to pick up the signal. There are several buttons on the sides, including the mute button. The problem with this is that when you are holding it, you keep accidentally pressing these buttons.It does have a nice display and features. Not worth the price to me!"
2,If you want to use the phone to talk on it forget it.,"The phone is great for music and internet when you can get connected. But for phone calls you might as well forget it. It teases you by telling you , you have a great signal and then when you go to make a phone call the signal goes down to nothing and your call gets dropped over and over again.So if your looking for an MP3 player it's great but for a phone forget it."
2,A Tremendous Disapointment,"The Brain Powered series was a major letdown. It showed promise in the first few installments, even if the plot was a total mess and half of it didn't make sense. So, I figured finally in this last volume, everything would be addressed. I was wrong. If anything, I am now more confused and angry at having blown forty dollars on this manga. This series definately raises more questions than it answers and will leave you extremely frustrated. If you have only bought the first one, conserve your money. You may be compelled to read on, but be forewarned that you would be better off moving on to a different series, Brain Powered will leave you unfulfilled and forty dollars poorer."
4,Alternative views on infrastructure development,Interdisciplinary analysis that highlights the role of incentives in sustainable rural infrastructure. Survey of ideas and many project examples.
3,OK...but a little frustrating,"This was my first time buying and attempting a 3-D puzzle. And I must say Ihave my work cut out for me! NO WAY can a child do this alone!The most frustrating part is that the pieces are not ready to be put together. You have to sort through them and pull off the ""extra"" pieces with the red dots. Then there are levels to add.Maybe more experianced 3-D puzzlers were aware of this but for a newbie it was frustrating!Hopefully it will look great once it is completed!"
3,One more Castle,Not very hard to do. Fun to do with grandchild. Going to add to Cinderella colletion.
5,Esoteric Music Based on the Musical Seership of Richard Wagner (1948),"If you want to dig deeper in a more metaphysically inclined way, this book is for you and your love of Wagner's operas. Heline was a very deep woman with many occult strengths to her name. Her love of music and exploration of metaphysics rings true on every page. Wagner was such a controversial figure in music history, and this book will enable you to see the connection he had to Truth."
3,Made for groups,"I was hoping to use this book as a fun guide for homeschooling devotions, but it is not practical for that use. It is large scale, mostly sugared-up recipes that would be far better suited for occasional church groups rather than small-scale at-home (or healthy-conscious) groups."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Given the enormous spiritual stature of Chuck Pierce in the Christian community, I was expecting much more than I got from this book. It was nothing more than a string of scriptures with a few additional comments. I was expecting something alot more profound. It might have one or two insights, but it's certainly not worth the price of the book. I could have written this book myself. Why didn't I? Because I didn't think anyone would be stupid enough to buy it."
2,"Nice photos, No real help!","Skimming through the book I thought the ideas and projects presented looked very interesting, and they are. The problem is that the author gives only the barest of details on the ""how to"" part.This is NOT a book for someone who has never felted before (fortunately for me, I am familiar with the processes). This book comes close to just being a showcase forthe author's designs, which are lovely....but that's not all I was looking for.Rachel"
3,Good for beginners only,"This book is for very basic felting so if you are new to felting it is a good place to start. Not a lot of fancy ideas, but certainly works for the basics."
3,Not for Knitters,"I bought this book with the hope it offered knitting / felting projects. Instead it is a book about taking old sweaters and turning them into felted items. Many knitters, like myself, like to create felt projects from scratch. The felt projects were basic and most creative people would be able to create these without the help of a book."
5,Great book about felting.,Wonderful creative book about felting. It has been a great addition to my felting library. It has some nice beginner projects that don't look 'beginner'!
2,Buy a metal one instead,"It survived two uses before the little retaining loop parted company and another three before the whole thing stopped working, so maybe two strips of staples...I would not purchase this again, I picked up a second Stanley Sharpshooter pro for only about 30% more. My old one of those has survived eight years of use and abuse and I expect my new one to duplicate that."
5,My yoga class's favorite CD,"I have used the Ambient CD for nearly 10 years now to accompany my yoga class. This music is so beautiful and varied, and has an incredibly lyrical and relaxing wind-down during the last 20 minutes, when we practice savasana in meditation. Everyone in my class says they always feel deeply relaxed and sleep soundly the night after yoga class, and I think this CD contributes a lot to the experience. I use other music in my class, but this CD is by far the best to accompany a focused yoga class that melts away tension and fatigue."
3,Short on power,"Original equiptment has 2, at least 6 ft power cords, giving you a 12 ft. + area from outlet to use computer. This has 2- 3 ft. cords, giving you only a 6 ft reach from outlet to rear of computer, not nearly enough. Seems to have excellent power, I really think my computer is faster than with my original equiptment, but maybe with the damaged cord it was not getting all the power it should have had. If you do not need a long distance from outlet, I would recommend this cord, but if you plan on plugging it in and sitting anywhere other than right on top of outlet, pass this one up. I checked Amazon add, it does not give you the lenght of the cord. I did not realize when I bought that this was something I should have looked at...."
1,Minus 3 Stars,Forget a woman even trying to use this. My husband has to get on the floor and use a great deal of force and dexterity to even get the screw into the cork and hold the bottle so it wont keep turning.... then he uses needle nose pliers to get the cork off the screw. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT!!!!
2,wine bottle opener,Should be 'no stars'! It i a worthless machine that takes a giant to operate. Take it off the market!
1,A tragic waste of the time and talent of a terrific writer,"Uninteresting, purposeless characters lost in a book in which they obviously have no desire to appear -- I am a strong fan of Cecelia Holland, have been since ""The Firedrake,"" and found myself checking and rechecking the front cover because I could not believe this was a Holland book. Howard Carter is a faceless, personality-deficient automaton, the Egyptians are tiresome paper dolls. I still cannot understand why on earth Holland would have written this, let alone let it go to print.Skip this one and go directly to ""Jerusalem"" and ""Great Maria"" or any of Holland's wonderful prior works such as ""Until the Sun Falls,"" ""Rakossy,"" ""The Kings in Winter"" and ""Two Ravens."" Why these are OP I cannot fathom, but they are readily available at used book services on line, and are worth seeking out. Please pass on this hopeless, fortunately uncharacteristic waste of time and paper."
2,"This was ok, but no where near her usual...","I thought I would really like this book. While it did entertain me for an hour or so, I didn't think it was a keeper. The story should have been divided into two distinct parts, rather than the abrupt change at chapter 9. The first part is from the point of view of Howard Carter. The second part is a third person view of King Tut and his family. There for a while I wondered why they had placed Tut's story after Carter, but then some of the nuts fell into place. But the characters have no depth. You don't get to know the Carter gang well enough to care, and they are very shallow. Tut is shown as a spoiled, whiny little brat with his shallow wife. The ONE thing I did find interesting was the theory behind Tut's death.Go ahead and read this book, but don't expect to be overwhelmed. I enjoyed ""Great Maria"" much better."
1,Not in widescreen? What's the point?,"Unless there's a typo, the DVD release is in old-fashioned TV aspect ratio of 1:33 to 1. Kind of unconscionable, but if they're only making these on-demand, maybe they don't care."
5,Great movie--why isn't it available ion DVD?,This was the first Gene Hackman performances I ever saw and I loved it. This is a moving and thoughtful story with great performances by all of the actors. I have a VHS tape and no way to watch it. Will it ever be available on DVD?
4,See it for the performances,"I had to give it four stars because in truth INSFMF is somewhat haphazardly directed, but the acting is out of this world. Melvin Douglas is watchable in just about anything, but he really gives one astounding performance here, as do the rest of the cast.The film rather unflinchingly looks at a strained father & son relationship brought to a head by the mother's death and fathers advancing senility. I think the script does a good job of showing how both parents and children are profoundly flawed in their understanding of each other, and provides no easy answers as to what ""the right thing to do"" is when human frailty requires tough choices."
1,Poor Quality,"I loved the glasses. The print is so colorful. Unfortunately, even though I washed them on the top level of my dishwasher, after many washings, the glasses spidered. And then they started to leak. I had to throw the whole set out. Not a good investment unless you want to hand wash them each and every time."
1,NOT RELIABLE-Read the reviews,"This device may be cheap, but you're getting ripped off for every penny you spend. Look at the average rating on these reviews, and you'll see about half of them are a 1 star rating. This means the charger FAILED for half the people that used it, and probably a lot of those rendered the ipod (or whatever device)useless. Don't risk your new iPhone on a cheap charger, because there's absolutely 0 chance that the supplier will refund you, and you're probably invalidating the warranty when you do this too. There's a reason this product is marked down to TWO cents, and that's because it obviously doesn't work.Mine froze up my new iPod touch, I had to restart it."
5,love it,like this one great not only for ipods apple charge to much for something like this great product
4,Charge it Cheap on the Road,"Why pay for iPod branded products? This charger is cheap and it performs perfectly! The iPod branded version of this adapter is $30.00! Talk about paying for the name! Buy this one and save over $20.00, for something else."
2,Not delivered,"I am a little disappointed with this vendor. In my original review I explained how my items never arrived to me and their delivery method said it was. I gave them a poor review and heard back from them. They asked me to please reconsider my review and that if I changed it to a higher score that they would resennd the complete order. Unfortunately, I only received 1 piece of a 3 piece order. I sent them an email explaining this a few days ago and have not heard from them."
1,won't charge my shuffle,"This won't charge my shuffle, haven't tried it with the our i-pod nano yet. Company offers a guarantee, but the postage would be just as much as the shipping."
2,it's okay,"i bought it because it was the cheapest of the cheap, and it charges, but i am afraid to let my mp3 charge more than two hours, because it doesn't shut off after it is fully charged."
3,ac adapter,"by some twist of fate, I recieved two. First one I used died, so thank goodness the second one was available! So far, so good!"
2,A misleading product,"This product looks good, but unfortunately, it does not do the job.The estimated time to come was good, it came before the day it was supposed to come. However, I didn't like the time it took (almost 1 week and a half) and it wasn't worth it.Now the product itself: at first, the product was working just fine, which is you plugged to your Ipod, connect it and it activates the charge mode. It did actually. The real problem was that when I left it the entire day charging, IT DID NOT CHARGE THE IPOD ENTIRELY. It is a major fail to the product itself and that's a bad thing for me. I rated this 2 starts because of the delivery time and because its still works. if you are looking for a charger that can hold the battery life as long as you have it connected to the wall, I would recommend this, but if you want your Ipod charged entirely, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Cheap and Cheap,"I received the item as depicted in the first picture--it is NOT foldable. It is made of cheap plastic and is not very professional looking.Crucially, it does not stay connected to my outlet (well, extension cord) because the plug is on a narrow platform. It keeps coming unplugged and thus does not perform it's function.On the other hand, it does have a little LED light that indicates whether it is plugged in (or not, as the case may be). However, the light is quite bright, so it isn't appropriate for the bedroom.Ultimately, it did charge my smartphone (not fry it). And, at $3, that is all I expected. But, I've decided to spend more and get something I actually like."
5,works well,"It is a simple product but it works well. I have now two of these, one is still working after a year."
2,Kinda scared to use it,"This item was cheap which is why I got it, but now that I have it, it looks cheap and I'm kind of scared to try it out because I've read that some non-apple brands can short out Iphones. I'd rather not risk it. Spring for the real deal."
5,worked great,for once a cheaper electronic that acctually did what it was supposed to. i love itbecause you dont always have a computer to plug in to and i have seen a few quie pricey but this one was great price great size and got it fast!
2,It doesn't do the one thing it was made for very well.,I bought this as a backup plug to charge my iphone 3GS.I worked fine for the first 3 weeks. Now about 75% I get a message that states this accessory is not compatible and able to charge the device.What the what? That's the only thing it's built for.I noticed that if I plug it in it holds it at the same charge level. So the device does not loose power but it does not charge.
2,Great Price...Not a Great Charger,"Ordered this item because my girlfriend wanted an extra iphone charger to stick in her purse for travel use. While there were mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance for only $2. The red indicator light came on when plugged in but it would not charge her iphone at all. I decided to try it on my HTC EVO 4G. It did charge but did so VERY slowly. I guess it just depends on your device. Personally, I would recommend dishing out a few dollars more for a quality item but if you'd like to take a chance with such a small price point, you may have better luck."
4,USB/AC white,"My son ordered this- it seems to work fine and was affordable. Not a super high quality product, but for what he paid, it works ."
1,Doesn't work,I bought this item and have tried with several different cords and it will not charge my ipod. The red light will come on for a little while and then turn off. I've left the ipod plugged in for 8 hours and it still did not charge. Waiting for a response from company. I would not recommend since it's just a waste of $3.
5,works just fine.,"have used it to charge &/or play zune hd, original zune, moto droid x, htc phone, and portable speakers. great value for money, esp cuz i got it w/free shipping."
4,"Very convenient, one drawback.","Product came in condition described, worked fine with my iPod Touch. There is one drawback, the prongs aren't retractable making it hard to neatly tuck in somewhere. Although the pictures indicate the prongs aren't retractable, it would have been a nice touch."
5,great product,"great product, it arrived promptly and in great condition. works very well with my itouch, and i've had no problems so far. some of the other reviews have mentioned that it takes longer to charge than when connected to a laptop. i cannot say whether or not this is true, but what i do know is that for the great price i got it at it's worth it either way!"
5,I like it :),"I think this was very inexpensive, and it will work for my mp3 too (bought for ipod)! Shipping was a bit of money, and it works. Great gift for the boyfriend."
1,Terrible,I received the USB Travel Charger quite fast. But when I plugged it in it did not work. This item was a waste of money.
4,"Not the speediest charger, but good for the money","Took almost twice as long to charge my 4G ipod. To be fair, my Ipod is several years old, but charging it through the computer never took this long. No worries, just charge it through the night! Great buy considering the price tag."
4,iPod charger,"It's hard to imagine that an item that was inexpensive could actually work, but after a couple of weeks, we've had no problems with it. I seems to charge the Shuffle faster than the computer. Let's hope it lasts."
2,"Cheaply made, cheaply priced","This item is very cheap, and that is why I purchased it. But after several uses, the contact prongs pulled out and got stuck in the electrical outlet. So, I purchased a replacement. Guess what? Same result. The old saying, you get what you pay for, reigns true here. I recommend ordering a better, more expensive model. Or, order a handful of these because they break so often."
1,Very Displeased,"After I took my charger out of the packaging, I attempted to plug it in. But I had barely even gotten it into the plug when there came a big spark and flash of light, it looked like it was going to go on fire. And i know that it was not my outlet in my wall because after that i plugged something else into it and it work just fine. So this product did not work for me at all! Basically i just waisted 6 dollars and never got to use it once. I was very displeased and I will never buy from this company AGAIN!"
4,so far so good,"fast charge,like many of these type products ,it seems cheaply made.It seems to work well though.Lets see how long it lasts."
1,Very Poor Quality,"The product delivered was not the same one as described. After only two months, it stopped working and cannot charge my iPod. Do not buy this USB charger and waste your time and money."
5,Simple and great! Works with my Sony walkman too!,"Not much to say, as this product is very simple- it charges! And for that it works great. An indicator light lets you know it's charging. I used it for a sony x series walkman. It seems it works for any MP3 player. It's definitley worth your $4.00!"
2,"It works, but be careful","The product is definitely worth the price I paid (approx $2.50/unit). It charges my 2nd gen iPod touch, but the prongs don't hold the unit in the socket. I attempted to bend them closer together to see if they'd grip a little tighter, but that hasn't helped. Wall outlets seem to hold on better than power strips or extension cords, but if you live in an old space with few outlets, this wall wart will cause quite an inconvenience. Most importantly, I wouldn't want to leave one of these chargers unattended while plugged in for fear they could come loose enough to start a fire.This product will get the job done, but you might consider going up a price point to find a product with better quality components. Buyer beware."
4,Good buy for the price,I use this to charge my ipod. The product works very well. The only complaint I have is that the red led is too bright when it is plugged in. I overcome this by connecting it to a outlet controlled by a swithc and turn it on only when needed. But for the price this is a great buy especially with free shipping
1,Did not work on iPod Touch 3G,"While many folks say this worked for their iPod, it did not work for me. Red light comes on but iPod does not charge."
5,Save yourself some money.,"After spending nearly $300 for an iPod, why spend an additional $30 for a charger? This charger works just as well as the Apple version."
1,Not worth it,"I originally got this as a side gift for my friend to use with the main present. SO glad I forgot about this when wrapping it up! I decided to use it just to charge my iPod.. plugged the unit in and *poof* a spark. Replugged it in again and same thing. Now, go figure it doesn't work in any outlet.. It's not even the one pictured.. Never really experienced anything like this."
1,Short-lived,The product worked for about three months but then died.I would recommend against buying this product.What more can I say.
1,No go for the Zune,"I bought 2 for our Zune players and both don't work. They light up just fine, but do not charge the Zune."
1,Does not stay in normal outlet,"Both metal plug pieces are the same size, so when you plug this into an outlet, it will fall out."
2,eh its ok,"I got this for my mp3 player so I can charge it on the wall instead and I say its easier to do but you have to wiggle the darn thing to get it to work right and you have to fight it. I still charge it with it, the only reason is cause it is still gives me the option to charge my mp3 player while I can play games on my computer"
5,Works perfect and great price,"I've had this thing plugged into the wall powering my iPod Nano for 2 months. It works perfectly from the start and hasn't had any problems. Seemed too good to be true from the price, but it really is a good product. I can't imagine buying a replacement charger from Apple after getting this.UPDATE: After 18 months, this thing is STILL working like a charm. Works with my iPhone too. Best couple of bucks I've ever spent on a cheap gadget!"
4,WHITE NOT BLACK (I'm not racist),"""It is a very nice item but in the picture it show a white charger although it doesn't specify like it should, so I led to believe it was white but infact it was black. It still works nicely though."""
2,Only charging iPod never used,Seems to not be charging my iPod. Is this perhaps due to the fact that my Shuffle (old style - long) has been used with iTunes? You get what you pay for - almost.
1,Money Wasted,"I purchased this charger for my ipod shuffle and it didn't work. I plugged it in, put the ipod on it and the next day the ipod was totally dead. VERY disappointed with this purchase!"
2,ipod charger,"The product(s) work the way they should, I just wasn't happy that I received 2 of everything that I ordered!"
5,Ipod wall charger,5 people in my house have ipods or ipod shuffles... this was a well needed product. Thanks
1,potential hazard,"cheap, works but take a look inside when one of the plugs breaks off, amazing it passes code, could be a hazard"
3,good,"charges everything in the house, tablet iphone, itouch you name it. love the fact i cat find it in my purse being that is white"
5,Works Great!,"This works great and gives enough power for tablets as well as phones. I would recommend this item, it's worth it."
5,Definitely a Great Deal!,"I purchased this item because of the low price. In fact, the vendor offered this at a much lower price than I found at Walmart - believe it or not. I did select the ""free shipping"" offer since I was not in a hurry to receive it, but I was happy to have received the item much sooner than stated. The item arrived in perfect condition, is well-built, and works just fine. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,Compact and Cheap!,"Just what the doctor ordered. It's robbery what Apple charges for their chargers, considering that if you buy one of their $300+ video ipods, it doesn't even come with one! Just what you need for on-the-road charging, and it weighs next to nothing."
1,Beware...things are usually cheap for a reason...,Broken after 3 uses. Extremely flimsy. Spend a few more buck and buy something more substantial.
1,Doesn't work for the IPod Shuffle,"This product doesn't work with the IPod Shuffle, even though the description says it does."
1,Horrible,It was defective when i got it! It is really cheap and wouldnt work. When i checked why the blade was loose.
5,Great Seller,The items ordered arrived a couple of day after ordering them. They work great for charging an iPod from a wall outlet.
1,total SCAM!,"i wasn't even sent the same charger in the picture, it was crappy, plastic, did not have folded prongs like described, and did have a red indicator light, that always turns on when plugged into the wall, not to indicate charging. DOES NOT work with my nano or shuffle, I won't even bother sending it back because it was cheap. I don't even care what it looks like, as long as it worked, and it doesn't! Was supposed to be for a trip..."
1,"Unfortunately, it didn't work","I purchased the travel charger to charge my FlipVideo camera. Unfortunately, it either isn't compatible or just doesn't work. At least it was inexpensive."
2,"Not what is pictured, but the price was great","The picture and the description implied that this had a folding plug. However, this is not what I received. It seems to work and the price was great. It says on the back that the output is up to 1A, however after 5 hours my phone still isn't fully charged. My old USB AC adaptor that I replaced this had an output up to 700 mA and it charged my phone in about 3-4 hours."
1,Doesn't work.,This thing does not work. The USB port barely fits in and it charges whenever it wants to.
3,"Works, but clunky","Obviously this is an inexpensive product that demonstrates ""you get what you pay for."" It works, my Ipod charges no problem, but the prongs aren't retractable. This makes the product rather awkward to pack and always poses the risk of bending/breaking due to the design. Ultimately, is it really worth $20 for a quality charger when you can have this for next to nothing? I'm happy with my decision."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Sometimes it's true, you do get what you pay for. I paid $[...] for this charger, shipping was free. Pretty cheap! My stepdaughter used it to charge her Creative Zen. It worked fine the first 4 or 5 times. Then, one of the prongs broke off and stuck in the wall outlet when she tried to unplug it. $[...] charger is dead!I do have to say this: I purchased it on Amazon from Importer520. I ordered it late on a Friday night, and it was in my mailbox the next Thursday. That's pretty good service on a cheap item with free shipping."
1,It doesn't work,This wall charger worked for about two times and then it stopped working and it is not charging my iPod anymore.Don't buy it unless you want to waste your money
4,Does more than what you paid for. ;-),"Item says ""charges mp3 players"", but I use it for my GPS and for my phone. Excellent product to pack in your travel bag."
4,Wall USB power,"Great product, but not the same type of charger that is pictured. The size is a little larger than the Apple branded one shown and it has no removable wall prongs. Still does what it needs to do and converts AC power to USB slot."
5,Very pleased,This product is 100% as advertised. Works without a hitch and is usual in charging sveral different devices. Would recomend this product to everyone because it is excellent.
2,Horrid,"Didn't expect much but got way less, shorted out after a week, but it did what it was supposed to"
4,"Feels cheap, works good","This product has a cheap feel or heft to it, but it seems to work well and hold up well. Overall, I am pleased with it especially considering the cost."
1,JIM,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT DAMAGED MY MP3 PLAYER AND MY WIFE'S DIGITAL PHOTO KEYCHAIN. I E-MAILED THE COMPANY WITH NO RESPONSE. I'M SURE THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO SEND ME THE 20 CENTS BACK!
1,Do NOT NOT NOT buy this!,My iPod has just been ruined by this charger!!! Its output voltage is very unstable.
2,"It works, after modification.","This is a very inexpensive charger. It claims to be for MP3 players but it would not work with the Sylvania SMP4029 MP3 Player, until I modified the internal circuit. I removed the label to expose the two screws that hold the case together. Pin 1 is +5 volts and pin 4 is ground. I cut pin 2, leaving it open. Then I soldered a short wire from pin 3 to pin 4. I put it back together and now it works with the Sylvania."
2,The good news and the bad news are the same...it's cheap!!,"I bought a pair of these to have on hand and neither one of them produced enough voltage or current (not sure which) to make the iPod think it was being charged or to charge it either. I have had some chargers that were weak enough that the iPod didn't notice it was being charged, but did eventually charge up...not just very quickly. These didn't even do that. Not recommended. Pay more and get a good one."
3,I Pod charger,"After looking into chargers like this from Apple I decided to look for a less expensive alternative. It works and only cost about $3. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because the battery light doesn't turn on in the ipod while the battery is being charged, I didn't know if it was working or not until I let the battery go completely dead then charged it back up and the ipod was recharged."
5,great value,Does what it's supposed to without picking your pocket. I don't know why anyone buys electronics in brick and mortar stores anymore.
1,not working at all!,"saw a fire on the wall outlet the first time i plugged in, then found out it does not work at all. cheap for a reason."
1,Doesn't Work on Droid Incredible,Does not work with droid incredible. It makes the phone spaz. And does not charge.
1,Marginal Chinese-made product,"The photo illustration that was with the advertisement listing was NOT the illustration I am (after having purchased and being asked by Amazon) to review. The quality is a lightweight plastic POOR replacement for a USB wall charger you'd expect for use with an iPod or similar device.I will not be buying from Handhelditems again, thank you very much!BEWARE !!!!!!!"
3,Jimbo,"It is good for charging ipod, iphone and devices that charge by usb connection.It is not a good quality product but it is functional and need to bevery careful when using it. Otherwise,the plastic core of the usp portwill be broken."
3,functional charger,"this charger works well enough. very cheap, and from other reviews i've read, very inconsistent quality. be very cautious when buying, it worked for me but i'd say you have a 60/40 chance of it working out for you.as people say in my country. ""cheap ting no good, and good ting no cheap!"""
4,Good for the price!,"I bought this product form bargaincell and it shipped to my house 4 days early which was really convenient! At first I was a little worried that it would blow up on me, but it didn't and it worked great with my Ipod nano 3rd generation and it charged it really fast! To use it you just plug it into the wall and then plug your USB cord to it and the ipod. However the actual adapter was mainly made out of plastic. It is incredibly lightweight. The indicator light doesn't show when the ipod is done charger and it lights up if the charger is in use. Overall i recommend it for the great price! ( I paid $0.67)"
1,JUNK! Item arrived INOPERABLE,"Plain an simple as the title, the product did not work in ANY outlet or power strip that I plugged it into right out of the box.It's not even worth me returning from my APO.Do not waste your time or money on this piece of chinese junk."
1,Bad Buy,"i bought this item just about 3 weeks ago it worked for 5 minutes then that was it,the lights arent lighting up and the phone not receivign any charge by far a terrible product"
5,Satisfied Customer,"This Adapter works great. I use it in conjunction w/ the USB cable I also purchased from Amazon. It's Awesome, it get the Ipod charged and I have no problems w/ it."
2,don't let it drop,If you drop it will not work so be careful with it. Spend a little bit more and get a better quality charger
2,Not a good product,This charger causes all my Ipods to freeze up when charging and I usually must do a reset before being able to use it again. It works fine as a USB charger just not as an AC adapter.
5,Just what I needed,Not much to say about this product. Great price. Does what it is supposed to do. Great price. I use it for itouch 4th gen. Great price. Quick shipper. Did I say great price?
4,Great for its price,"I've been using this product for over one year and had no problems with it. Although it looks cheap, it worked great for me. Satisfied with this product!"
2,not as advertised,the charger was ok but the connector to the mpa sansa clip did not fit the player--fortunately i had another connector. too much hassle to return it. just fyi
5,loved it!,My son and I absolutely love this charger!! We use it to charge our Ipod Shuffle or my son's Nano. He also loves the little red light that glows and uses it as a night light when it's charging or not.
1,Sucks!,Does not charge IPOD TOUCH WITH CAMERA (latests) BEWARE!IT CHARGES MY PHONE THOUGH OR MY OLD IPOD JUST NOT THE NEW ONE.I LOVE HOW IT CHARGES A SPECIFIC DEVICE TOO. A USB CHARGER IS A USB CHARGER...COME ON!SOMETIMES PEOPLE ANNOY THE HELL OUT OF ME.................... CRAP THAT IS WHAT THIS IS...CRAP
3,Won't charge my shuffle.....,"Works great for my 4G iPod, but my 2G iPod shuffle won't charge when connected to this."
2,Beware picture doesn't match product,"I've ordered the USB charger that looks similar to a Macbook charger, however I received something completely different.You if click on the ""More buying choices"" panel on the right side, you'll see there's about 17 different merchants selling this product.A few of them put a different picture resembling a small Macbook charger, but in reality they ship a regular, ugly AC adapter.So beware if you expect to receive the product as pictures by merchants like Next Web or Ultimate Web Sales.Other than the form, the product works as advertised. You plug in the wall, and with a USB cable you can charge your iphone or ipod. I also use it to charge my blackberry using a USB to mini-USB adapter.Pros: works as expectedCons: design is very ugly - picture of some vendors are wrong"
1,Nice & cheap but short life,Purchased to charge an iPod shuffle. Charger died after 6 weeks use. Would not purchase again.
2,NOO!,"It's A Product, Cheap And Easy. Here's The Deal, Small Battery Life. It Lasted Me What 4 Months. Shouldn't Waste Money On This Just GO Out And Buy One That Lasts Forever. :/ Cheap. 2/5 The Product is Good The Battery Life Isn't"
3,Good police procedural with a weak ending,"Chief Inspector Wexford, protagonist in many Rendell books, investigates the shooting death, in an apparent robbery, of a well-known writer in her home, along with most of her family. The only survivor and eyewitness is the teenage granddaughter, Daisy, wounded and depressed. As the police investigate, a number of suspicious characters complicate the process; while Wexford's own strained relations with his daughter Sheila make Daisy's plight more poignant.This longish mystery, with well-drawn characters, plenty of red herrings and several social classes, is enjoyable until the end. The book comes to a rapid conclusion, as Wexford uncovers the truth in a burst of insight and detection, while short-changing evidence gathering.--inotherworlds.com"
4,My Introduction To Reginald Wexford,"I read this book in college for a Detective Fiction course and I loved it. I liked this book so much I went on to read about half a dozen other novels that Ruth Rendell has written about Reginald Wexford. This book isn't so much a mysterious whodunnit as it is about the private life of the detective, Reginald Wexford. It is pretty easy to figure out who commited the murders at the beginning of the book, but Wexford's reasoning is clouded somewhat by his personal life and his relationship with his younger daughter Sheila. If you aren't interested in reading a novel that is mostly social commentary, as most of the Wexford novels are, and are more into a murder mysteries that are hard to figure out, then this may not be the novel for you. If you are interested in reading about social trends that are current, and are written in an interesting fashion, I strongly recommmend this book."
3,Memory Lane,"This video serves as a nostalgic trip down memory lane for NASCAR fans. From Dale Jarrett's Daytona 500 win, to Rusty Wallace getting airborne (twice) this one covers it all. A must see for NASCAR fans."
5,Thank goodness for mnftiu,"The clip-art stars of David Rees's website have been my favorite refuge from the surreal events of the past year and a half. Can't believe what you just read in the paper? Feel powerless to change it? Get Your War On helps, somehow.No, the book is not beautifully produced, but the money funds landmine relief in Afghanistan. And your purchase supports the work of someone who isn't afraid to say what needs to be said.Besides, nothing has EVER made me laugh so hard."
2,Poor presentation of fantastic material,"First of all, Get Your War On is hilarious. I think anyone who would consider buying this book already knows that. You should be interested in how the book looks, how it reads, its physical presence, and so forth. As far as that goes, the book is sub-par.Each comic is presented on its own separate page. Since it was sent to the publisher a while ago, this also means that there isnt very much material... only a few weeks worth. So about half of the current online content is missing from the book. Since there are so many pages and so little content, it doesnt develop the same flow as the multi-strip pages on the web site. You'd probably be better off printing out the strips yourself, and putting it together. Now, part of the cost of the book does benefit the Afghan landmine removal campaign, but if you feel bad aboout it, you could always donate money directly to them.Hilarious comics, but not a good book."
3,Welcome to post-9/11 America,"""Get Your War On,"" by David Rees, consists of a series of cartoons in which a cast of office drones discuss life in America during the post-9/11 war on terrorism. Among the topics covered are the military campaign in Afghanistan, the anthrax scare, and the phenomenon of suicide bombing. The tone is satirical, with a very harsh edge.I found the book sometimes clever, but sometimes it is just unfunny ranting. Much of the humor comes from the pairing of banal white collar images with the often over-the-top, profanity laden dialogue."
4,Operation Enduring Freedom is In The House!,"Like Rees's other work, this clip-art homage to apathy, aggravation and the F-word, will definitely make you laugh. That is if you aren't turned off my incessant cursing. Personally, the political angles of Get Your War On don't appeal as much to me as the more random feel of My New Fighting Technique Is Unstoppable or My New Filing Technique Is Unstoppable, but it's funny nonetheless. It's definitely worth it for the price."
5,Great product bros!,"Great product that helps deal with razor bumps. All the brothers know what I'm talking about. If you're tired of having your wife, fiance, girlfriend tweeze those annoying ingrowns then this product will definitely help. I've been using for over a year now and I started seeing results after the first two days. The cocoa butter really makes the skin soft and smooth and helps the hair get soft which eliminates the hair curling back into the skin."
5,Fun!,"Moms and daughters who like the Little Girls' Bible Storybook will enjoy this sticker activity book. Coloring pages, activities, and stickers are all based on the Bible Storybook. It's another fun way for girls to learn about the women of the Bible."
1,Not a good choice,"I do not care for this book. The stories are so heavily retold that they are almost unrecognizable. By always using the point of view of one of the female characters, the stories lose focus. The story of the crucifixion/resurrection is a particularly eggregious example of this. Choose another Bible storybook."
1,Thames & Kosmos Microcontroller problems,"To my disappointment the Thames & Kosmos Microcontroller kit only works properly on Microsoft Operating systems that predate Vista. That said, RC Boca Hobbies accepted my return and the process was smooth as butter."
2,I'm very disappointed.,"Silent Mobius is a story about a team of women that fight monsters. It's like a lame version of Bubblegum Crisis. The things I don't like about this anime are:1: The animation is bad. It's an older series, but the technology for way bTetter quality existed at the time.2: The story had a good initial idea, but was not carried out in an interesting manner.3: The characters. There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care about them.4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube. Definitely don't buy w/o watching first. There are people out there that like this series. This is just my opinion. So you may want to give it a shot. I hope you like it."
2,Nice mud flaps but...,I purchased two sets of these WeatherTech mud flaps for the front and rear of my 2011 extended cab Silverado LT. Five minutes after opening the box I had to make arrangements to return the rear flaps. The first screw was SO TIGHT that the hex wrench stripped the head of the stainless steel screw. The front set of mud flaps fit well and were a breeze to install. If the rear replacement flaps fit as well as the front set and I don't strip anymore screws I would gladly give these flaps 5 stars.UPDATE: The rear replacement flaps arrived last night and went on without a hitch. As another person commented these flaps could stand being a little longer but other than that they are great. The fact that I didn't have to drill any holes to install them was my primary reason for buying them. *****
4,So far so good.,Received my rain bibs just in time to test them. We have had three straight weeks of rain. No complaints they appear to be up to the task.They are quite oversized so order a size smaller than you think. I am 5'10 and 165lbs and the mediums are very roomy. Good news is there will be plenty of space beneath for winter gear.
5,Buy Smaller Than You Think!,"Enough has been written about this fine product and so I will only add that I weigh 190 lbs and stand 6""1"" tall. I would normally order at least a size large and often XL. Thanks to other reviews i ordered the medium which was just right."
3,synflex,product is very good however our dog likes the human formula much better. mu next order will be for the human formula. the product does make a marked differance in oud pet
1,"Too little, too much $$","I don't recommend this! The bottle is tiny and it cost us $25, plus it leaked in the package they sent us. You can get more for your money elsewhere."
3,No Resuls Here After 8 Weeks!,"We did not see any change in our 10 year old American Eskimo. I was hoping to be giving this product a excellent review, but I guess that is not going to be happening in regards to our dog. The product may work for other dogs, but honestly we saw no change in our dog in the past 8 weeks. Best bet I have used up to this point is a coated bayer asprin once or twice a week hidden in some food."
1,No results after 8 weeks.,"My 10 year old cat has hip problems. He will no longer jump on the sofa or bed but he will climb his way up (not good on the furnishings). My vet recommended glucosimine so I researched the brands and I chose synflex because of the reviews. Unfortunately, I have not notice any change with my cat after 8 weeks of use. I have 8 more weeks left in the bottle and plan to continue until it is gone. I will not continue to use it if there are not any noticable results when the bottle is empty. Synflex may work for others but it is not working for my cat at this point. Side note: My cat doesn't seem to mind the orange flavor of synflex; it smells like baby asprin."
4,Works for Cystitis too!,"I started giving this to my 16 year old male kitty for cystitis and he no longer has a problem. It started working in 2 days. He doesn't like it mixed in his food, so I have to give it to him orally with a syringe and he hates it.I've also been giving it to our 16 year old female kitty who has arthritis in her knees, but when on this, she doesn't limp anymore and can go up and down stairs and jump on furniture again.125mg/0.75cc is keeping both conditions in check ;-)Update 9/15/11. I had to switch the male to chewable glucosamine (Glyco-Flex II Feline) because giving him the liquid was stressing him and me out too much. And he loves the little ""fishies"" as I call them. However the female won't touch them so she's still on Synflex."
4,seems to be working,bought this after trying other products for my dog with hip dysplasia.. this product is the first one that seems to be helping her...
3,Not so great for my dog,kept my lab on this for the full 3 months and saw no difference. Disappointed. Maybe she just has too much hip damage at this point. Might have been better if I could have found this when she first started having trouble.
3,very good,I recomended this books its like new and the book dont Have nothing i buy the glencone pre algebra an integrantes transition to algebra geometry
4,Very Helpful,I had to prepare for some college placement exaims and needed a refresher course. This book was a trememdous help to me!
5,My First Real Shooter,"I saw this game for a few dollar at large compuer store and said what the heck. I can say that out of many games I buy like this, one in twenty are worth it. Well this one is one in a hundred. It was a great game and I had tons of fun. What else can you ask for!!!"
4,Bummer,"Did not work with Windows XP as they touted. We tried on two different computers that had XP and it still wouldn't load. We finally bought another Sarge's War for the Wii from a different company and it works great.My ""tween"" loves this game; even his older brothers give their approval. Just bummed out that we lost out on the first try."
3,Just OK,"I'm not sure if I'm being fair, but the topic is just too big to fit in a small-paged, 205 page book. The level of discourse is too high-level. Most anyone with a beginner's level of history will not learn much.The writing is fine, the illustrations are good, but there's not much to this book.You may also find that the author takes some odd sideroads. Britain's history with India was ""parasitic"". Agreed, but it seems odd to follow that up 30 pages later with a favourable comment about the role of seafaring in propagating Iberia's ""rich culture""."
3,GREAT AS AN ADDITIONAL GRAMMAR!,"This Hebrew Grammar is not thorough enough to be used as an independent introductory Hebrew Grammar. I used Page Kelley's Introductory Hebrew Grammar along with the companion handbook to work independently. Kelley's grammar equipped me to skip Hebrew I and II at seminary. But reading Hebrew for Biblical Interpretation along with a solid grammar can be a rewarding exercise. One of the great things about the grammar is that it gives you more than morphology, phonolgy, and some syntax--it actually involves you in the exegetical process that scholars and students alike engage in. One is introduced to the sigla of the masoretic text. If one is looking for a manageable review this book is for you."
4,Excellent Introduction,"This is a good introduction to Biblical Hebrew, or alternatively, a good review for someone that has been away from the language for a while, and is returning. Its strongest point is that every other chapter involves some aspect of Biblical studies (and is not strictly about grammar). This provides a grounding in the language that conventional grammars do not have. Because of this, this book is a good spring board for further studies in Biblical Hebrew."
5,EVIDENCE FOR SPIRITUAL REALITIES,"I was first introduced to this book by some friends in Scotland over 15 years ago and have wanted to find it and read it again ever since. An American friend recently loaned me a copy of another book by Helen Greaves, TESTIMONY OF LIGHT, and I loved it. Thanks to Amazon.com I now discover both the title, THE WHEEL OF ETERNITY, and the author, Helen Greaves, of the book I read and so much liked earlier.Helen Greaves is an excellent writer and has the ability to convey spiritual truth in an attractive and compelling way. THE WHEEL OF ETERNITY demonstrates that what we sometimes refer to as 'ghosts' are merely those who have passed over to 'the other aside'. Above all, she demonstrates again that there is nothing to fear in death and that life is eternal. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand spiritual truth.Read it!HUGH MAGEE"
4,The wheel of eternity,"The book was in excellent condition and I love the contents of this book.It really explains the illusions of death, loss, and separation."
2,It's just OK,"I had higher hopes for this book, and found myself skipping over many parts of it. Just not that interesting. The writing, having been written long ago, was stilted and dry. Basically, the Nun was recounting what she was up to in heaven. Could have been better"
2,Great song but the BEST version is not published,"Have you heard the Tracy Young remix of Dirrty? If so, you know the domestically released version stinks. Tracy Young, in her mastery of remixing, has created an undeniable hit with Dirrty. You Billboard Chart watchers know that Dirrty reached a miserable peak of 45 on the Hot 100, yet the dance version was Top 10.Do yourself a favor and listen to the Tracy Young version. You'll know exactly where I'm coming from."
3,Doctorow's first...,"My third Doctorow book. First was The March, then Billy Bathgate and now Welcome to Hard Times. The man is one versatile writer.The whole idea of rebuilding this small town where you know all the weirdos in the community is fun. It's a simple tale in some ways, but the Bad man from Bodie represents so much more. I believe this is similar to The March, in that it's a quirky, enjoyable story that takes the reader on a wacky ride. At the same time, there's so much underlying meaning besides the events and characters..."
3,Men's Hair Pump Spray,Holds ok but not as good as the Gillete's Dry Look Max Hold when it was on the market. The spray reaches a narrow area of hair when pumped.
1,Broken Item,"I send this set to my friend as a wedding gift.However, he said that it was broken.I am very disappointed because it is a gift,not my stuff."
3,Southwest F.O.B. - Smell of Incense,"Beneath purple violet marshmallow skies, men in chocolate raincoats ran to hide under giant mushrooms before the strobing sun melted their splendor into malted streams which would be tapped and barreled by the by odd inhabitants who lived here there and nowhere. With reality but a mere conception to this gentle race, they pressed their ears to the sides of their sphere, they listened to filtered weak radio signals and smiled with passioned delight, and in unison they all pushed the boundaries, as if to explode the bubble that shaped and nurtured them, determined by a singular act of sheer will to share all they were with something known as the Summer Of Love.Yeah ... this is yesterday's now music, it makes me feel good to have been so carefree and innocent, and while I can no longer see the fire, I can still feel it's heat.Review by Jenell Kesler"
1,Nadine............That's It.,"Southwest F.O.B. was Dan Seals and John Colleys' music catapult to semi-stardom. This album contains all their released tracks, and as Sundazed usually does, features unreleased photos and songs. What I had a problem with was the lack of any ear grabbin or even finger snapping music. ""Smell of Incense"" might have been a good enough single then, but now, it sounds a lot like rehashed wanna-be psychedelia. The vocals are not to the forefront enough for such a talented vocal combo being present. To make matters worse, ""Downtown Woman"" is not remastered in stereo like it's medley counterpart, ""Nadine"", the only song on this album that stands alone. If only the whole album were composed of remixes it mightv'e got a higher rating. Get their seventies stuff."
5,All of Twain's humor but without the anger,"Machado de Assis was a literary master, and it comes through in this collection of tales. ""The Devil's Church"" has a biting wit every good as Mark Twain's, and without the tinge of religious hatred that Twain exhibited in his later writings. ""The Hidden Reason"" is probably the finest short story ever printed; it easily surpasses the best American short stories, and is a cut about the English and French. Read this book!"
3,Disappointing effort!,"This book should be in a larger format! Everything seems so jammed together and the print is small. I don't think the photos of most of the women are very flattering either, some I did not even recognize at all the photo was so bad. Some did'nt have photos ,like Mae West. I thought the whole point of the book was to see the glamour girls! Also since I like vintage fashion and make-up I was very disappointed,I was'nt able to get any inspiration what so ever!"
2,I just want to correct something,Someone mentioned Caroline and Janet Munro. The late actress Janet Munro is not actress Caroline Munro's mother. This bit of misinformation has been around for decades and Caroline Munro has been refuting it for years. They are not related. Just ask her.
3,A Different Definition of Glamour?,"Glamour girls, to me, are women who have been in the spotlight, admired by men, and have had their faces and bodies plastered all over the print media. This book, however, has far too many no-name Playboy centerfolds and far too few of today's REAL glamour girls like Cindy Margolis (way too far down the list for me), Brooke Burke (absent!) and Laeticia Casta."
4,Technically Challenging,"This book is not for the faint of heart.It is a highly technical book and written only for thosewith experience in this field.The book does not start out with basic definitionsand is written for individuals who have professionalcredentials in this particular industry.Personally I look for a technical book to begin withbasic theory and then build from there with orderlyprocedures and fully worked mathematical examples.The author is a good communicator, however if youare looking for basics in this field, it's a littlesteep to try to start from this material.If your a professional already working withexplosives in a research facility you will find thisbook to be an excellent treatise.If like myself youonly have a passing interest and are looking forgeneral content, then this is not for you.I was looking for information regarding pressurerelief for dust explosions inside productionvessels and purchased this book by mistake."
2,"Self-congratulatory profanity, but there is a star in there","Laden with swearing, excessively violent descriptions of food and hunger and mistakes, this story of a few days' drunkenness would be a total waste of time if it weren't for the main star of the story, the city herself. If you can take the time to plough through Grant's blathering about how hard he parties and how good he is in bed, you may well find yourself enticed towards the city he describes, although you'd probably rather not have him in person there as your guide."
1,Grant is ahead of his time...,"...either that or he is an unmitigated fathead. I have read better prose on bathroom walls. His insecurities bleed forth like, not like a wound honorably received, but like a menstrual flow that won't stop - he just keeps dribbling on and on.Don't waste your money."
2,Disapointing quality and content,"The quality of the video production is very marginal. There is a warning at the beginning that it was recorded in EP mode, and to adjust tracking if there is a problem with picture quality. No amount of adjustment could compensate for the overall poor quality of the picture.There wouldn't seem to be many age groups that this video would appeal to. There isn't a lot of big rig action and sounds that seems to captivate childrens interest. The content is weak at best, and there isn't enough action or sound to make up for it.Even at the low price I don't think it is much of a bargain."
2,Should have been more engaging,"A story about a troubled, jazz lover, artistic young man should be more interesting, especially with Amber Tamblyn involved. But it just wasn't. The story plods along and there are too many things left out. I can understand some mystery and uncertainty, but there just isn't enough of substance here to keep most folks interested for long."
4,In Your Head Freaky,Sprial was a decent movie. It wasn't really scary at all. I found that it was just freaky seeing what went on through the whole movie. The ending caught me off guard though. If you like pshycological mysteries then I would take this movie for a spin.
4,Throught-provoking view into the mind of a troubled artist,"Spiral is an interesting independent film. Moore is totally believable in his role as a mentally disturbed artist. His neurosis seems to be amplified with the presence of Amber (played by Amber Tamblyn). Without giving away any spoilers, I would recommend you watch the film without thinking too deeply into the scenes. They initially appear to contain hidden meanings and messages (perhaps the power outages do fulfill this role) but the twist at the end will reveal them to be false and it is a straightforward plot. Albeit, there is an almost Freudian perspective on Mason's behavior and relationship with his parents.Tricia Helfer was in a scene for only a few minutes and sported a shorter haircut. Her dress does make her resemble one of the final 12 cylons from Battlestar Galactica."
3,Even with Tricia Helfer.....,"Like many of the other reviewers, I couldn't help but think of this film as a Film-school project.Without giving anything away - I didn't understand why a string of (apparently) a dozen or so pretty girls found themselves romantically drawn to the main character.His boss - buddy - defender at least hinted that they were somehow high-school classmates. This kind of explains his connection - but does not satisfactorally tell us why he feels so protective.When the boss broke up with his girl-friend...non other than Tricia Helfer from Battlestar Galactica...he lost all cred with me! ;) If she wasn't in this movie - I would have made this a 2-star review."
2,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD MOVIE...........,"....keep looking, 'cause this ain't it. A dark, bizarre movie chronicling the events in the life of a mentally disturbed artist and his interpersonal relationships. There are no likeable characters here...and our leading guy is boring, weird, and completely flat as an actor. At some point the line between fact and fiction becomes completely blurred...for both the actor and the audience (at least in my case). Or maybe I simply dozed off....This is NOT a movie worth purchasing...if you must see it, please rent it. My best advice is don't spend vaulable time on it at all.DYB"
3,Good movie,This movie was an interesting psychological thriller. It was well done with a very unusual twist at the end. I enjoyed it. A good movie for people who pick up on subtle details.
2,silk lined gloves,"The leather and the silk lining were of good quality; however, I was disappointed with the quality of construction."
1,Woefully misinformed,"In typical knee-jerk style Ms. Smart reacts to psychotherapeutic drugs as though the fall of Christ is to come shortly thereafter. Incomplete, insufficient and inaccurate research is the name of the game here. I too could write a story about my experiences on various psychopharmacological drugs and their impact on me, however what is important here is that these drugs when taken properly and under the care of a physician rarely produce the kinds of side effects she describes. Perhaps she needs to understand that Serzone, a popular medication for depression is in fact NOT an SSRI. Interesting idea, no support. Try again.While blaming school shootings on meds is convenient, why not look at the fact that 1. the children had access to guns in the first place and 2. the children managed to breech the campus with them. Furthermore should there not be some analysis in which we ask ourselves why children would bring loaded weapons to school in the first place. Show and tell?"
2,Do not purchase,Do not buy this product. The first time I used it to work out it broke. The plastic piece that adds the strap in securing it on your arm broke. I use to have one of these about 4 years ago and it worked well. But again this one broke the first I used it.
3,Good for the price,"Quick and simple...Pros: I am a 6'3"" lifter and this fits around my arm fine. It fits my mp3 player fine. The plastic ear phone cord holder works as intended.Cons: The other reviews are absolutely correct, the plastic bit that help tighten the arm band broke the second time I had it on(just do what the one reviewer suggested and but the metal ring to replace it immediately). The players buttons were difficult to get to without stopping and looking at the device...a big deal if I am in my ""zone"" and have to mess around with the MP3 player.Cheers!"
2,Broke Quickly,"I really liked this since I lost my Sony pebble :( It is a good idea, but I had to cut a slit in the side to be able to access the on/off button on my mp3 player (not a sansa) The real problem is that after wearing it only a handful of times, the plastic ring buckle broke and now it's useless."
2,A little disappointed.,"I bought this about 3 months ago so I'd have music while I work out..gee, today it fell off of my arm because the plastic loop bracket broke. I'm not tough on this type of thing, so I would have expected to have it for a lot longer than a few months."
1,Griffen armband broke during first use!,I liked this for the first 20 minutes of use but it then it broke. I super glued the plastic ring and used it again. And then the other side of the ring broke.
2,Good product with a weak link,"There's a lot I like about this product: It was very easy to install my Sansa, the armband is comfortable to wear, and the cord wrap works great! The weak link, literally, is the rectangular plastic piece that the adjustable side of the band passes through. I used this armband ONE TIME while jogging for about 20 minutes before the plastic link broke. I like the product well enough to deal with the hassle of returning it for a replacement. I'll post how my replacement fares once I receive it and use it for a little while..."
1,piece of junk,I bought this because it was able to hold the mp3 player (has a slip in pocket) without it being clipped onto a band but the product was very disappointing because after one use of about 30 minutes the plastic piece that the band thread through broke.
3,Not comfortable to wear,The velcro kept poking my skin and it felt uncomfortable to me. I had also ordered a much cheaper armband here on Amazon that might not look as cool but doesn't feel as uncomfortable. Go figure..
3,Not the best quality,"It was fine at the beginning, but ened up coming apart at the seems. Not the best workmanship. One would think they would build something designed to be used for exercise a little more sturdy. I guess I'll sew the seams back together until the rest of the band finishes ripping like it has started to. A little disappointing."
3,Griffin Armband,"The armband certainly does the job: it's heavy-duty, if not a cutie. It allows access to the dial and all functions of my Sansa E280, and certainly won't fall off. The problem is it resembles a brassiere with D cups, while the Sansa is a delicate little device. In other words, the armband does not at all match the style statement that the Sansa makes. It obscures the player and draws attention to itself. Good gravy, Griffin, you oaf, you don't need to suffocate that little woman with those giant cups!"
4,Good Quality,"A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Its heavy duty and holds my E280 in place whenever I go running or play basketball. It gets uncomfortable after an hour but that might just be me because I have skinny arms. Of course if you just wiggle it around once and a while, it feels better to have on for longer periods of time.Good product for a Great MP3 Player!"
1,Broke during first use,"I purchased this to make it easier to listen to my tunes while cutting the lawn.The cheap plastic peice broke, so I replaced it with a LARGE keyring ring.To bad they didnt use a .05 cent peice of metal instead of the crappy plastic part in the first place.Works great now."
4,Navy Seals Luminox Watch,The watch was received on time as promised. It is excellent. The only negative is that the registration card and directions for the watch werenot included with the shipment.
4,Carole does it again,"Carole Lombard was a talented star. She could play drama, comedy andscrewball at the drop of a hat. Her co=star Fred MacMurray gives hera run for the money in this one. I recommend it to anyone who likesjazz, comedy and drama rolled into one good film for the ages."
2,Not one of his best,"Mitchell Leisen is one of the neglected and underrated directors of Hollywood's golden age. This movie, however, is not one of his best. The picture and sound quality are rather poor for starters. Although MacMurray and Lombard have been in other Leisen movies, they don't generate many sparks here. MacMurray plays the troubled brilliant trumpeter part as a kind of physically and morally lazy cipher. There's not much about him for us to get excited about and therefore not much to make us believe that Lombard would go for him and rescue him from the skids. I mainly got the DVD because I wanted something by Leisen, but the joke's on me because now (or very soon) two of his best - Midnight and Easy Living - are out on DVD. Get those and No Man of Her Own (if you can find it)to see how adroitly Leisen mixed comedy, drama, romance, and the darker aspects of human nature."
5,In Silhouette,"This is only one of three Sun Ra albums I own, but is my 2nd favorite, when compared to Nuclear War which is the #1 favorite so far.Jazz in Silhouette is more traditional then some of Sun Ra's sound experiments, such as the first three tracks of Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy. That's too out there to make for enjoyable listening for me personally. Jazz in Silhouette has a few tracks that definitely stray to the bizzare in some parts but there's always a very pleasant flow to the whole thing.Definitely worth my money and a fine addition to the Sun Ra collection."
5,Any Herman Blount record will educate you,"There are literally hundreds if not thousands of Sun Ra albums. Not all in print of course. This one is pretty nice. Some like this one are jazz with a slight twist. Some are completely abstract, some are something different from anything you've ever heard. There are Do Wop and Disco Sun Ra albums made well before the terms Do Wop and Disco were coined. As a matter of fact it could be argued that Sun Ra invented Do Wop, Disco, rock and fusion jazz since he was experimenting in these genres long before most anyone else. They are all worth listening to."
4,Pretty Good Session,"This was released on Ra's Saturn label in 1957. It's not quite as startling, colorful, or brilliant as ""SuperSonic Jazz"", which he released in 1956; the edges seem to have been filed down a bit on the music. But it's good stuff, listenable jazz with an exotic edge.The one amazing track here is ""Ancient Aethiopia"" - it fuses eastern & western motifs together and sounds well ahead of its time."
4,ok,"it wokrs correct and under his instruction. shipment was good and fast as was promised. I recommend this item to all, who search a midi-controller to his vst-instrument.one thing: in my complect was EZ-drummer demo, but I wait for BFD like in description"
3,Not so sure...,"Now that I own this MIDI Control Pad, I'm not so sure. I was really excited by the various videos on youtube and reviews I had read. But the responsiveness is just like every other electronic drum set out there. Not enough sensitivity. I mean, ideally, it should be able to detect any impact with it in anyway, much like a condenser mic. I wasn't expecting THAT, but I was expecting more. It's really not terrible. I'm not going to just throw it up on ebay. It's usable. At least for getting down some basic ideas without plugging away by hand in my DAW."
5,Great Book,"Anyone who has the ""fever"" will love this book. Some of the stories in this book are almost fable like. If you like this book, check out World Record Whitetails for an even more in depth look at large bucks through the past century."
5,Quick Service on a Great Product,The book was perfect.It arrived when needed.It was a great Christmas present that was very hard to find.
5,Bargain,"This is the best bargain I've ever found on the internet. Works flawlessly and is very, very cheap."
3,"great item, but not the length advertised","This is a great cable at a great price, but this item is not as long as it is advertised. It did not work for my application. It is slightly less than 6' 2"" from absolute tip to absolute tip of the cable. It will work great if you only need a 6' cable. It will NOT work if you need a 6.6ft cable as advertised."
3,Pretty Good,"Theses cords are a nice back-up in case more expensive cords stop working. I had a five dollar cable that fizzled after a year and I replaced them with one of these. They work - but the picture doesn't capture contrast as well as a five dollar cable. The sound is very good though. I've ordered a $10 cable that claims to be better for the 120HZ refresh rate my TV has ... I'll come back and add to my review if the ten dollar cables really are better than these.Edit: The ten dollar cable came in and, yeah, I can see a difference. Nothing earth shattering, but the ten dollar cable has better clarity and color. These twelve cent jobs are handy to give out to relatives who don't know their not getting HD or if you run a business with like a million HDTVs and you just want to keep your over-head low. Chatchkas basically."
3,It's Ok,"I purchased these cables out of curiousity. I wanted to see for myself if it was true that all these HDMI cables are the same. I hooked it up to my PS3 and my 46"" Sony XBR4 LCD TV. I compared it to a M1000 Monster cable. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!!! The image on the monster cable was A LOT sharper and the colors were more vibrant. The refresh rate was a huge difference as well. I did get a 1080P resolution so they did get the job done. I would reccomend this cable if you want a high resolution signal and medieocre colors and sharpness. Does it make sense to buy real cheap shoes with an expensive suit? No!"
4,HDMI Cables,"The price is right. The quality of the cable isn't the greatest, but it works very well. I can't complain at all."
3,It was fine...,"The first volume starts off with the shocking fact of how many people regardless of who they are, on an average large number of native Japanese commit suicide. It was very alarming and eye opening. It focuses on how easily young women are hazed while attending high school, and eventually cave in to their peers. Sometimes, when those impressionable or with little will power do something like this, it often times could have been prevented. It also highlights on prostitution in the second half and how at risk teens often get caught up in those things."
4,Digging dog statue,I had seen a statue like this in someones yard and wanted to order one for my friend. She seems to love it (and her Jack Russell has attacked it a few times so it must look real!)
3,The Grim Grotto,"I think this book is distinctly average and fails to really further the series until the last page. Most of the jokes get repetitive after a while and all of the `aye` and water cycling descriptions are tedious.But, the book serves it's purpose of carrying on the series, although it seems to be filling in a gap.Good but a bid dissapointment after the brilliant `The Slippery Slope.`"
2,lemony snicket,"I have the book and the unabridged cds. Tim Curry made the book interesting because he has a great voice; although, I did not like the story because I am into the crime/detectives kind of books. However, if you are into the adventures kind of books then it is a great book for you, because the children go on a lot of unexpected journeys."
4,Finally,"For all those who see the series as simply an exploitation with the same tired plot line, Finally, there is some plot development and a heightening of the mystery. Can you figure it out? Ah, that is where all the bits and pieces that are dropped in teh first 10 books come in. So, there is a point in reading them, don't be discouraged! the end will more than make up for it (p.s. there are at least two more books in teh series)."
4,Edgar A. Guest,"I've enjoyed reading this series, and enjoyed this book. But Mr. Handler- aren't you being a bit hard on Edgar A. Guest? Yes, most of his poetry is undistinguished, but some is charming and enjoyable. What did he do to be held up (as it seems in this book) as a symbol of evil mediocrity? Did your mother force you to recite ""It takes a heap o' livin to make a house a home"" before you could go out and play?"
5,LOVED IT!,"This is a good book. This book ends where The Slippery Slope ends up. Violet, Klaus and Sunny are traveling rapidly downhill on a tobaggan."
5,Awesome,"This 11th book was superb! I finished it within three days. I do agree, Count Olaf and his henchmen are ridiculous now, they've lost their gruelsome characters, and even though they are still evil, they are now laughing for no apparent reason. Overall, this book was very good. Starting from the end of THE SLIPPERY SLOPE, the Baudelaire children encounter new adventures, uncover new information about the VFD, and Sunny gets poisoned by a deadly mushroom. They meet new people, live in an old submarine, and Klaus finds a girl that he likes."
3,Forgettable,"This book isn't bad. It's dull in some parts, a bit exciting in others. The only thing is that it is somewhat forgettable. It could have been a much shorter book, or could have even been packed into the end of The Slippery Slope. Not much is discovered in ""The Grim Grotto"" and it is a bit sad that this is the third to last book in this Series of Unfortunate Events.Violet, Klause, and Sunny enter a submarine with a man with annoying speech habits, a girl whose character changes too dramatically too soon to make any sense, and Phil from ""The Miserable Mill"" which was a pleasant surprise. Count Olaf's new laugh, which he displays on numerous accounts, is annoying, but I must say that the last chapter of this book, in which the Baudelaire's return to Briny Beach, is quite good.I recommend this book because obviously I support the series, but it is not one of the better of the twelve released so far.6/10"
3,A large lack in quality!,"Unfortunately, Lemony Snicket has got the book wrong this time.This book was dull and dry, lacking everything the other books in this thrilling series conspired.In this book, the Baudelaire orphans find themselves in a VFD submarine, where they meet Captain Widdershins and his daughter Fiona.Captain Widdershins and his daughter are on a quest to find the sugar bowl, which is meant to be hidden somewhere inside the grim grotto.Unfortunately it isn't.But Violet learns something very interesting, that the hook-handed man is Fiona's brother.Very interesting!The grotto is infected by a large plume of poisoin mushrooms, and if a spore of the mushrooms touch something, that something will linger on and then die.This unfortunately happens to Sunny.Read the 11th book to find out if Sunny survives!"
3,"It wasn't the best in the series, but isn't woast either.",It's okay. It drags a bit in the middle. This book doesn't stand by it's self. You must read all the other book in the series to understand a lot of this book.
5,Wonderful!,I was delighted to read this wonderful new installment in these unfortunate books. And what an ending! I can't wait for #12!
4,Extra points for unique setting.,"The Beaudelaires are on their own again and in search of the all-important Sugar Bowl. They encounter an irritating submarine captain and learn that sometimes to hesitate is good, and they also have a run-in with a very poisonous fungus. More information is revealed about V.F.D, the identity of one of Olaf's henchmen, and the whereabouts of some friends.We are rushing towards the climax of this series and this book seems more like a bridge between the last chapter and the next than a book of its own. I am loving Sunny's affinity for food and cooking."
3,A bit slow,"A Series of Un-fortunate Events is good reading material for younger children. They probably will want to emulate some of the characters in the books, which would be fine... especially the calm and intelligent Violet. They are interesting stories and well written, I find some of them slow.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,Race to the sugar bowl,"I would recommend that you read this book because it has a lot of suspense, action, and mystery. The Boudalaires race to the Grotto trying to beat Count Olaf and mysterious things happen on their journey. This is one of the best Series of Unfortunate Books, but not my favorite. It still is a good read."
4,"""He Who Hesitates is Lost!"" ""Or She!""","This book is very good. I've read all 11 of the series of unfortunate events books and this is one of my favorites.But, there's only 2 things I didn't like about this book.I'll say the most annoying 1st, which is Captain Widdershins always says""He who hesitates is lost!"", then his retarted stepdaughter Fiona always says ""Or she!"". That got VERY annoying!Also the other annoying thing is Fiona is like really messed up!!!!She's CRAZY!!!!!!!Fiona is the definition of EVIL!!!!!!!Other than those things those the book was cool! The ending was one of the best yet!I hope the next book comes out soon!!And remember He who hesitates is lost!Or she!!!"
5,A Depressing Review,"The Grim Grotto by Lemony Snicket is a great book. It is the eleventh book of the series. This book is about the three Baudelaire orphans. Their parents died in a terrible fire that destroyed their entire home. Ever since then, a banker named Mr. Poe has been leading them to their fate. The first place he brought them was to the house of a villain named Count Olaf. Count Olaf is a murderer and would do anything to get the Baudelaire fortune.In the Grim Grotto, they find a submarine and inside they meet new people and someone they never thought they'd see again. They also interfere with a terrible fungus named Medusoid Mycelium.Will they survive this terrible fungus? Read the book to find out!Written by Anna."
4,_<<^^*!!!thrilling!!!!*^^_>>,"The 11th book in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events is The Grim Grotto, a mystery that takes place under murky waters aboard Captain Widdershin's yellow submarine, the Queequeg. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Bualdelaire must find a crucial Sugar Bowl before their nemesis Count Olaf does. But when Sunny's life is threatened by growing mushrooms the two elder Bualdelaires must find a way to save her, and themselves- in less that an hour!A well-written book that has you hanging onto every moment-hard to put down!I gave it 4 stars because he sort of drones on about the water cycle a lot- a tad bit boring, but other that that, it was GREAT!!!"
