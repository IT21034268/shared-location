1,You must be kidding!,"I have read a lot of science fiction books, mostly television spinoffs or continuations. I have also read the previous books by Mr. Hatch. This 3rd installment should never had seen the light of day. It was the most confusing, poorly written, wandering novel since the ""Prometheus Design"" or ""Mirabile"".I question the wisdom of reading or purchasing the next book. In my opinion, ""What a miserable addition to the Battlestar Galactica universe""."
2,disappointed with this webcam,"I bought this webcam from Staples this Thanksgiving. I have been felt very disappointed about this product. I am thinking to return it.1. The image of the webcam is too sharp, the contrast is too strong! I was like a ghost in the webcam when the light is not bright. Even in the daytime, if the light in the room is not bright, the image is still very dark. This device couldn't adjust itself well according to the brightness of the light.2. No built-in microphone. Maybe it is my fault since I assumed it should have. This feature is important to me since I don't want to always wear the headset.3. The base of it is not secure enough."
4,very good buy,the web cam is really worth the price with all its features. the best part is that the image quality is very good. i would recommend this webcam.
3,Works fine,"The camera works fine, but I hoped for more improvement over the $5 webcam that it replaced. Picture is better, but not that much."
5,Great product for the price,"I have this camera for a year and a half now - it's working great, clear picture, and is very convenient."
2,Just Average,"I received the camera and was not happy when I found a cheap mic that was attached to the cord of an ear peace instead of the the superior sound mic advertised in the ad. I called Amazon, they had no appolgies and said the most they could do was refund my money.On another note the picture quality was ok but froze at least 2 times or better per use, as for sound I had to put the mic up to my mouth before the person on the other end could hear me.Not very happy"
4,Good price!,Works well. software can be installed easily. Good resolution. So far do not have any issues with the CAM.
4,Great Webcam,"Good picture quality, good colors and auto focus. Comes with software that does animations for the live pictures, its fun. Would recomend it"
2,Great picture quality. Bad design.,"I love the picture quality of CL's WebCam Live, but it designed to sit on a flat surface only, it seems. Putting it on my desk would leave too great of an angle between the lens and its object, so it is sitting on top of a pc speaker, which gives it more height. However, there is no way to steady it, so continual adjustment to keep the camera as still and as leveled as I need it is necessary. It has three legs, two of which are ""clawed"" at the ends, so I don't understand how it fits a notebook or an lcd monitor. I just don't like the design. It is picture quality is fantastic though."
2,sucks,"poor image quality. cant see anything unless it is daylight, or you have ten lights on. its stand is akward and doesnt really fit on anything, and the cord is a little too short."
1,Not Vista Compatible,"I really liked this webcam when I had XP on my desktop. Sadly, Creative has decided not to develop drivers to enable Vista compatibility, and believe me, this camera wont run on Vista. Too bad they decided to go the route of forcing people to buy a new camera (hopefully theirs). I wont be one of them."
4,Not bad after rebate,Good but video is kind of slow. It's USB 1.0 not USB 2.0. If you have broadband spend a little bit more and get the Live! Pro USB 2.0.
3,It's OK,"I will rate this webcam as a OK webcam. It got installed without any hassles the picture quality is also good but the frame changes are very slow. Sometime I think I am watching a movie in a less speed. I got this in a good deal in amazon , in about 20 bucks. On that price it is a ok webcam"
1,No Windows Vista Driver Planned,"I bought this about 6 months ago. Now that I have installed Windows Vista on my computer, this webcam is a paperweight. Creative has decided NOT to provide a Windows Vista driver for this webcam. DO NOT BUY this if you plan to upgrade to Windows Vista."
2,Creative Labs WebCam Live!-- Is not Good,The WebCam is not good at all. The picture quality is very bad. It is stuck every time..
2,Software is useless!!!,"I bought this camera to use for motion detection as an extrasecurity device at home to email me if motion is detected.The jocks at creative have helpfully failed to include the option for smtp authentication so no email you try and sendwill ever get through unless you have one of the rare few emailaccounts where the smtp server does not require a password, ifyou do it wont last for long.[...]Aside from that the camera is good but I'd suggest getting another one with software that is useful because this is a bigfeature."
4,"good deal,neat design,made in Korea","actually you can manually adjust brightness and contrastness, as well as gamma correction.good picture quality,a little bit slow caused by data conjestion ? via LAN connection,but where you can find USB2.0 at this price?btw, I believe Koreans' made after I bought 3 iRivers MP3 players."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We bought two Creative Labs WebCams and we could not get the sound to work on either one. (one was for grandma). We worked with Creative Labs to try to get it resolved and never could get the sound to work at all. By the time we got done working with Creative Labs, we passed the return time with Amazon, and Creative Labs would do NOTHING to help us. Now we are stuck with two useless web cams..... TERRIBLE customer service. What should have been a wonderful Christmas gift turned out to be a pain in the you know what all around. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!"
5,Amazing Amazon's Creative Webcam Live!,"I liked the webcam a lot. It has a good picture quality. I also liked the handy headphones with the microphone, it was a pleasant surprise."
4,"Image quality is good, easy to install, affordable.","I am using this webcam since the last 6 months. No issues whatsoever.It was easy to install, took just minutes. Plz install the software and then connect the webcam as specified in the manual.I use it for video chat and everybody says the image quality is good.It sits nicely on top of my laptop display. does not slip or fall.Also got a collar mike with this webcam which was plug and play. No drivers needed.Creative Webcam Live will not disappoint you."
2,"Camera works fine, but drivers/software are making me nuts","I installed the camera, and it works fine and has a good picture. My biggest gripe is with the software that came with the camera. If you install the camera webcenter software, it will launch repeatedly on its own and start filming and snapping photos automatically. If you uninstall the software and leave the drivers installed, you keep getting an error message from the windows image acquisition software. To get rid of this, you have to uninstall the drivers, which disables the camera. I'm not sure if my problems are typical, but I find them highly annoying. In this day of privacy concerns, I would have expected Creative not to introduce something that behaves so suspiciously."
4,Works like a charm,"I got this camera a couple of weeks ago so that we could do video conferencing within our geographically dispersed team. The camera works great, as does the software supplied. We are using it with Viack, which is another great product."
4,Good Webcam,"clear imagewide anglewise design of standthe only thing i dont like is that as long as it is attached to the computer and the computer is on, the green light on the web cam is always on"
4,Webcam Live works well with 3rd party software,"The camera works very well. We use it to communicate with family and it's been great. We've been using 3rd party software from Yahoo IM to make the video conferencing happen. The only problem we're experiencing is difficulty getting the voice data through the microphone that comes with the camera. We usually use the land-line for sound. Otherwise, the camera works very well."
4,Rock n roll say HELL-O to Satan.,"Wow, what a terrific off beat Dario Argento type satanic horror film. Has neat Heavy metal soundtrack and real interesting plot premise about the end of days and Satan coming round the bend. With a nifty climax this movie is one of those you love to tell your friends about. Recommended. If you like The Omen you will like this."
1,this DVD has NO English subtitles,"Although it's a NTSC Region 1 disc, there are no English subtitles. Do not buy this unless you happen to speak Spanish fluently."
4,Nice quality,These are great finger puppets. The kids adore them and they are a good price. I actually broke up the set and gave them out individually as gifts.
1,Now that's what I call nonsense.,"A cute and interesting read. Not bad toliet reading at that. Nice cover, promises much, but delivers little beyond that promise. You can do the same thing on a skateboard too, with skill and practice. Read and enjoy, but you won't get anything beyond another book for your sinister collection of ""dark knowledge"". I think the author has hit on a new way to sell bad fiction. I suppose that's a magick of a sort."
1,Faulty bracket,"Purchased this CAN AM rear trunk box new from our local ATV dealer and used the standard quick release bracket to secure the box to our ATV. During the first trail ride, the bracket released and the box fell off the ATV during the ride. Spent the next three hours searching the trail by foot to find the box and its contents. Once it was recovered we resecured it using a lock. Second trail ride, same thing. Half way through the ride the box fell off, only this time we were NOT able to recover it. This faulty bracket cost us hundreds of dollars of equipment including 2 custom helmet's. We will not be returning to CAN AM for our next ATV accessory purchase."
1,Plano rtv box,"The latches are a joke,the tie down straps are useless,thank god they supplied u bolts to mount it with also."
4,Plano atv box,"I really like the box ,it fits atv perfectly and allows me to carry plenty of gear,would have preffered different hold down system ,but overall great box"
4,Holds a Lot,I've had this box for a couple of years now and have even flip the Grizzly a couple of times and it is none the worse except one of the bungee latches came up missing. As other posters noted the latches are quick but leave something to be desired.
2,SHOULDA COULDA WOUDA,SHOULDA BUILT THIS BETTERCOULDA BEEN A GREAT BOXWOULDA GAVE IT A BETTER REVIEWSHAME ON YOU PLANO YOU LOST A CUSTOMER
3,Bad latches and mounting,"I've been using this box for a couple of years now. The box itself is great, but falls short in the latches and in the mounting system. I've had to replace both twice now. Finally went to bolt thru mounting using some steel strap after the straps rotted away again. I ride a lot, so the bike is outside a lot. The bungee latches are a poor idea. I'm looking now for a replacement steel cam style latch that I can bolt on. Should be able to come up with something once I can spend some quality time in the hardware store. Over all a good box, but disappointing in those two regards."
3,Durable,Very duable but the rubber cords that hold the lid shut suck. could of had a better way to keep the lid shut.
4,Very Simple,"Great inexpensive box for an ATV, I did shop this box and I found it to be twice the price at several other companies. I'm very happy with the price of the unit, I couldn't see paying anymore then what Amazon offers it for... Simple to put together."
4,Nice product for the money,"It's a nice storage box that fits a lot of stuff, and it seems to be sturdy. I was a little disappointed that there was some assembly required. It only took 20 minutes or so, but definitely was something that could easily have been done at the factory. I was also expecting the seal to keep more of the dust out. Maybe the seal needs time to settle in, as I used it for the first time in cold weather...we'll see. Finally, the mounting straps tend to loosen up after riding for a while...they just need to be tightened every so often."
1,Do not Waste your money,"This thing doesn't work at all, It doesn't broadcast the signal 12 feet away with no walls. I think wireless internet and wireless phones are afecting the signal. Anyway do not waste your money like I did!!"
1,Not what I expected,"I was highly disappointed. I plugged Transmitter into my Satellite receiver and the reciever into my Television in my Den, less than 8 feet away and 1 wall between them. The picture had static and the sound was squelching. Tried and tried to adjust and could not get it to come in. I have purchased another unit similar in nature and plugged in and worked immediately, no adjusting at all."
1,Don't waste your time,"It seemed like such a good idea! Unfortunately, when I got it, it didn't work as expected. I hooked it up to my DirecTV box and hooked the other end to a TV in the same room (about 12 feet away). The 2 units were pointing directly at each other. I was using the a/v connectors, and not the cable connector. The picture was satisfactory, but the sound was obscured by hissing. Although it has 4 channels to choose from, none proved to fix the problem. I do not recommend buying this."
2,works well under Ideal conditions,If you have a clear line of sight not over 50 feet this device works well. However if over 50 feet and have to broadcast through walls its performance degrades rapidly.
2,Not worthy,This book is not worth to buy it. It's outdated and the content lacks in depth details. Pictures are old some of them b/w. I would not recommend this book. The off road bible is a lot better book compare to this one.
5,Good refrence,"Handy no nonsence book on fourwheel drive stuff, how to for various situations. As a guy it is sometimes hard to admit to needing instruction, we should have all knowledge through osmosis, this book gives the foundation all that is required after is practical experience."
1,A good book for the ladies,"If you just bought someting like a Ford Explorer, this might be good for you. This is a basic, basic treatment of the subject. The subject has been covered much better in other books that are now out of print. If I had seen this book in a store, I would not have bought it."
4,Rago 6206 Panty Girdle,Excellent fit and the shaper really helps support lower back. Gridle is very well made. I want to try a smaller size for even more support. What I find confortable is the rise and wide band make the fit stay put. It is difficult to find a support girdle for everyday wear that does not create a 'sasuage effect' and is not binding. This is the best overall back support girlde I have found.
4,Almost everything I hoped it would be. . .,"Although the artwork is more than up to par, in a good portion of the book, it's too small to enjoy it fully. If a magnifying glass was included with the purchase, it would be five stars all the way."
4,A very attractive figure,"Fortune is a good figure. She has a very attractive outift equipped with very attractive...er...sunglasses. The figure is fairly easy to pose, but she cant go into complex poses like the Olga figure can. She comes with a pistol and a very cool gun.I had a little difficulty fitting the guns and such into her hands, but they fit fairly well. The figure is very good at standing up.Overall, a solid buyThe good:Great sculptingcool gadgetsThe bad:figure cannot go into very many posesthe ugly:The sunglasses dont fit on very well, and get get very easily lost.Summary: A pretty good figure for the money"
3,MGS 2 Fortune,"Received this product in a timely fashion. I mostly bought this for the RAY piece, and I'm an obsessive completest. Fortune stands find on her own with no attachments. Her little hair thing that covers her eye fell out when I pulled her out of the packaging. The sunglasses stay on as long as she is stationary. The pistol fits well in the holster, but looks silly in her hand with the way her hands are posed (shes meant to hold the rain gun. The raingun is the major problem with this figure. It does not fit well in to her hands, and the little rubber strap broke as soon as I put it over her shoulder.All in all, a decent figure, if you never ever move her after you spend 15 minutes getting her in a decent position (and even then I have to have her subtly lean against the shelf wall."
2,predicatble,"Playing the hold'em a few times I was frustrated with the predictability of play. In the satellite games it became to easy to get enough money to play in the ""main event."" Each time around the same seat raised and after a flop the players would call the first time and then the next would fold. Hands did not seem to be random as too many time I was dealt K7-K7-K7 followed by J6-J6. And if it only happened once maybe but sequences like this were all to common. In the main event rather than play poker it was a study of what the game would deal me in order to take my chips. I played it and uninstalled and then gave it another chance and then uninstalled and trashed it.The satellite game was no fun because it was too easy to win and similarly the main event was no fun because of the nature of cards dealt and contrived play to take chips."
3,No what I had hoped for.,"The fact that you only get advice on No Limit Hold'em was a great disappointment. But I guess for the price it's what I should have expected. Plus, I should have read all of these reviews before ordering. I'm looking forward to playing Wilson's Turbo Texas Hold'em which is currently on it's way to my mailbox."
1,False Advertising,I ordered this game because it stated that it was compatable with Windows 98. My father wanted a Multiple poker game that would work on an old computer with Windows 98. When they received it it would not work. They called the manufacture and they stated that it would not work on Windows 98. They need to list the correct systems this game will work on.
4,Very good Poker Trainer,I am a begainer at texas holdem and wanted a tool to get me started and the program worked as advertized. The tips are great for a new player and it's good that they can be turned off when you've seem them a few times also it's good that the speed of play and player comments have controls all in all a good investment
2,"like the man said, it's scripted","After only a day of use, I can already guess what's coming. Lots of full houses that get beat by better full houses. I've seen lot's of these and they're all the same. I guess they can't do all the analysis if the hands are random. TJ's tips are probably based on specific hands, not generated by some sort of rule.But I only paid $10, so it's not all that bad for my first software poker purchase."
3,Center pole problems,"My baby, who is 7 months old, loves the table, and although she doesn't quite understand pushing the rings in the hole she loves playing with everything on there.Unfortunately, two days ago (about a week after we received the product) she realized if she takes all of the rings off, she can pull the center pole out and chew on it. She does this the moment we put the toy back together, and it is the first thing she does when she goes to the table if we repair it while she's doing something else.Since the reason we got the table was to give her something she could pull up on and cruise around, it still serves its purpose and is a good price for the value. I just wish there was some way to make the pole stay on (other than glue it, which I may have to do eventually)."
4,Entertains babies age 9mos - 2 years,"This toy is easy to assemble, battery free, and loved by my 15 month old and her 2 year old cousin. Our baby loves the stacking rings, but is especially happy about the slot feature. The slot is also a favorite of the 2 year old. My child has never gotten her fingers stuck in the slot, as mentioned in a previous review, but I can see how it could happen.On a side note, we bought this table to encourage our baby to stand and play in the hopes that standing play would encourage walking. It seems to have worked."
1,Don't Buy,"This table is not a good product. Once the kids through the rings and activities on the floor, which is the first thing they do, there is nothing left to do. Buy an activity table were everything is connected so they can continue to enjoy the activities."
4,Sneakers,"I purchased these shoes for my son, for school. The shoes are great, but run narrow in the front. He is a size 12.5, so I figured I would get him a 13 to grow into and they are just right. So, I guess it wont be long in these shoes before he needs a new pair due to just size and not wearing them out. A wide version would have been nice to see in these shoes."
5,Great shoe for a small foot,"My daughter has very small feet for a 15 year old and finding good tennis shoes has been a struggle. These shoes were perfect! Great fit, very comfortable and good support. She wore them for a match on the first day without any problems."
4,Good Guide,"I like that this book because it actually rates hikes. I need an opinion when I am provided with such vast natural beauty to choose from as in Hawaii. He also tells you the best sights for spotting so apart from referencing wildlife, fauna and marine life as you come across you can seek it out. A good reference to use before and during your trip to the islands."
5,Informative and helpful~,I'm moving to Hawaii in February for four months to work outdoors and this book has been invaluable for planning my weekend backpacking trips when Im' not working!
2,"Poor research, poor logic","Stanton's presentation in his book ""Marriage on Trial"" is transparently bigoted and anti-Christian. To suggest that a same-sex set of parents is an affront to a parent of the other sex is petty as well as illogical. To say that a lesbian parentage implies to men they are not needed shows his insecurity about his own effectiveness as a father. I'm a man, and I'm not threatened by lesbian parents I know. Glenn's logic does not hold, for in his view a successful single-parent would imply the same thing. It's nonsensical.This man is simply threatened by homosexuality. Is he above God? Stanton's love is selfish, exclusive, while God's love is inclusive of all. It is not afraid, like this man is. I feel sorry for him, and pray that someday he will be saved and see the true love of Jesus."
4,A Must Read for All Teachers,"I read Marriage on Trial with an open and curious mind. Marriage on Trial draws from hard evidence and well-known studies to back up their facts. I could find no hate for homosexuals in this book, only love for the person and an exposure of lies and myths.This book should be the definitive guide to equipping open-minded citizens in answering questions about homosexuality. After reading Marriage on Trial, I walked away educated, concerned yet feeling compassionate. A good book for K-12 teachers."
3,Not too bad... but there is better...,skateboarding is skateboarding... if you feel you need to have every video out there... then get it. But other wise... go pick up the new Blueprint video (Wainting For The World) its much better.
2,not the same,"the watch that came was not the same of the picture, even the color of the straps were changed..."
1,Did not last very long,"This was a very capable recorder while it worked. I bought it in 2006. It is now 2008 and I am without a working DVD recorder. It will not load the DVD so it will not play, much less record. I think the drive failed. The exact model drive is not available so I purchased a Plexar which list the same specs as the Pioneer. The symptoms changed but it still would not work. I installed the drive into my computer and it would not work, whereas the Plexar did. For the price of the piece of equipment, It should have lasted much longer. This is not to say all of these units are bad. I have owned a lot of Pioneer equipment over the years and have never had a problem until this one. I would not advise anyone to buy this model as it may have a design flaw."
5,"Solid Band, cheap price","I was very impressed with the band, especially for the price. I purchased the bands thinking they would a low quality since they were so cheap. I took a chance and ordered some. I was surprised to see that they such good quality and thick. I'll never go to a sportings good store again for my headband and wrist band needs! I will definitely purchase more from this seller."
3,too small,quality is good. but its too tight for my wrist and not with a huge wrist.. cant give it more than 3 stars
5,Very absorbant sweatbands!,Our summers are so hot and humid anymore that I needed something to wipe my sweat on. My t-shirt sleevesll weren't cutting it anymore. lol. I am an avid gardener and tend to the yard/flowers daily. These are great. I got the wristbands too. Absolutely no more sweat running into my eyes! I recommend these!
4,Very good and cheap,"I've looked and I can't find anything cheaper than these. You buy Nike or any other brand bands and it'll cost you $2.50 per band. Do notice the price is per 1 single band, not per pair.I agree with the other reviewers, they do look old after the first wash, so if look is important to you, you might want to pay more to get something better. But I have been using them for months now and what I really like is that they don't lose their elasticity they are still pretty tight around my wrist. My wilson bands didn't last long before going all lose. They are also SUPER absorbent. So if you are buying them because you don't want sweaty hands and want something cheap that works and don't care about looks, this is what I would recommend. By the way: I bought the 12th pack which comes out slightly cheaper even."
3,Sport Wrist Band,"Be sure to note that each package comes with just ONE wristband, not a pair which is customary. Not such a great deal when you realize that it it is just one wristband. Also, after just one washing they look pretty dull and don't keep their color. I do like the wideness of the band though. Also, a positive was very fast shipping."
4,Good quality wristband,"Wristband is good quality. Thick and soft material. Measures longer than standard wristbands. Have not washed it yet, so I can't review it's durability . It does feel like it would survive the wash. Good buy!"
3,Does not last!,"Great colors, but when I used them they quickly started to fray. They look much older right out of the gate, so I would not have purchased these if I had known."
1,Poor service,"I was waiting for my products over 4 weeks. Had to call in order to ask where my ordered stuff remained, they had no cluewhat was going on and wanted to send it again, but with a delay of another 4 weeks. Not a good service!"
5,Oustanding quality at reasonable price,"I was somewhat suspicious whether I would receive a quality product at the price offered. I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is excellent, and the price is outstanding. I recommend highly."
3,One is the loniest number,The wrist band is fine and seems to be good quality. Be aware that you get only ONE per package.
3,Well...,"I thought there were going to be two. That's my error. I am not really sure what else to say about a sweatband. Do I take the approach of that annoying reviewer who just needs to have an opinion about EVERYTHING to a point of saying ""I have worn sweatbands since I was 10 years old, so trust me when I say 'I know sweatbands...'"", or do I take the angry ignorant consumer route saying ""This company should clearly state that there is only ONE sweatband here!"" just proving to everyone that I do not care to read about the products I purchase.If you buy this sweatband, I wish you good sweating. You may want two... and some legwarmers. Or meggings if you are a complete (insert whatever expletive you'd like here)."
5,Good quality basic band,I have re-ordered these as the one i ordered a couple of years ago (as a trial) is still going strong... this is with heavy use... great value for the price.
4,Wonderful!,it looked great and fit perfectly! it definitely fit the description. i used it for part of my halloween costume and it was a hit!
3,Not good for hard plastics!,"I didn't like the fact that it didn't bond the hard plastic parts on my sewing machine together very well. It smells horrible when you mix the adhesive and the plastic molding solution together, so you must definitely hold it away from your face when you open the tubes to combine the solutions. Ofcourse, as I've said in my tagline title...it doesn't work well on hard-solid type of plastics. Sure, the description mentions that it ""may work on most plastics,"" it needs to specify what type of plastics. Eitherway, it didn't help me at all."
2,Great start that gets bogged down.,"You start with a great protagonist, and follow her through adventure and discovery and then she gets 'lobotimized' and the main character switches to her 'mentor'. Her great story ends and characterization in the novel suffers for the switch in characters. The mentor's story is about as interesting as an auditor trying to find out who's embezzeling money by digging through documents. It's boring and never picks back up from there. I enjoyed many of his other works, but this one is just lacking something for me.One thing this novel does well is present near future technology and the sometimes quirky results of scientific lines of inquiry in the present age."
1,Not Niven as I know him,"Okay, I'll admit up front that perhaps I should not write a review of this book, because I never finished it. I got as far as Page 73 and simply could not stand it any more. Stopping in the middle of any book is rare for me, but the boredome was unbearable. In fact, I only got that far because I am a great fan of Niven, which gave me hope. His ""Mote in God's Eye"" with Pournelle may be my all-time favorite novel. Maybe it's just because he has a different writing partner in this book, or maybe it was just an off time for him. But the spark is not there. The plot and character development were slow, tedious, and completely unrewarding. A painful read, at least the first 73 pages."
2,Promising start quickly deteriorates.,"What began as an exciting mixture of cybernetics and AI soon became a romance/chase seen that never really challanged the reader. Stereotypes abound and I never found myself attached to any of the ""human"" characters. ""The Integral Trees"" by Niven was far more interesting. Nothing new in ""Saturn's Race."""
1,"In this future, we are all politically correct Californians","The comment about being a profound disapoointment, rang true for me too. There is no inspiration here; just alot of formulaic pc ideas that have no life, no depth, no breadth to them; they are never fleshed out, just a string of descriptives: Capuccino, PC, the Kaypro, The Osborne, MAC lives! O comeon, there's more to sci-fi than reading PC Week.Alot of reading this book is like going to Fry's Electronics in Sunnyvale & not FINDING the diy computer kits; just the brand name pre-assembled off-the-shelf pcs & wondering why everyone is talking about this place; as a Niven (and Fry Electronics :-) fan I felt as though I had been rooked; it was incredibly boring and drawn out to get ....where?I honestly could not recommend this book that takes 10 chapters to get to some kind of plot & then jumps someplace before you totally understand what's happening.Buy it used if you must; read it at your own peril."
2,Very disappointing,Don't waste any time reading this one. It started out OK and then fell apart in the middle. It is not worth my time to write more than this.
4,"good sf-mystery, not as crazy as niven can be",this is a straightforward science-fiction mystery story. Evil men in power connive cunningly; clever good folks are interestingly brave in their struggle to uncover and defeat said evil. Niven doesn't play with the ideas as crazily as he could. Maybe the setting is too near-future? Maybe 'the theory and practice of instant learning' didn't click into the cybernetic conflict scenes like I expected...
1,Worst Niven book ever,"I don't know what to say. I love Niven books, and I loved the previous Niven Barnes collaborations.But this book was annoying from the first, and ended even worse. If you can call that an ending. It never WENT anywhere. It had some promising kernels of plot and concept, and utterly wasted them.This is the first Niven book that I can say this about: It was a total waste of my time, and I wish I had never read it. Utterly rotten, with no redeeming value what-so-ever. Ugh."
2,I wouldn't bother...,"The product is represented as being better then the competitors (of course). In my experience its the same thing. The only other one I've used is the Fellowes product. But, I see no difference. It is no easier to apply, and no clearer. It was packaged with a sticker attached to it that said something like this side out, which is fine other then that the adhesive was so strong that, if I wasn't able to get it off with goof off, would have made the product completly unuseable. I have no idea what they were thinking. Bottom line, don't expect a higher quality from this than any other screen protector."
2,Depends on what kind of user you are.....,"Well.. is difficult to explain, but let's start - FIRST : Is not good under certain light conditions because is not as **Clear** as they say.. SECOND : i installed onto my PPC6700 screen following the right directions and just after the installation this protector has scratches on the surface (it's too delicate??? ) THIRD: The surface is not as SOFT as a screen must be,so is easy to catch dust on the surface... in a few words: If you like crystal clear and enjoy the original screen on your equipment do not use it. But if you are a user who can easily scratch the screen then use this product : Is better than nothing."
3,"not very soft, but cute!!!","I ordered these sheets for my 5 year old son's room. I would not sleep on them, but he does not seem to care that they are scratchy. They are very cute and the colors are very vibrant."
1,Almost fit perfectly/Not so perfect anymore,Update (October 7th): I've been meaning to come back to write an update. It's been about three months since I've purchased these sheets. I'm honestly disappointed that the fitted sheet is almost in complete rags. For some reason the fitted sheet is torn at the corners when coming out of the washer. This happened the third time. I'm usually setting the washer at dedicates or perm press. This is such a bummer because one would thing the TH brand is of high quality and I suppose it's not.Original review: I love these sheets for my two-year-old son. I'm trying to do a subtle surfer theme in his room and these work perfectly for what I'm going for. I only have a problem with the fitted sheet as it almost seems like it does not fit properly on the twin mattress. I'll over look it as you won't be able to see the fitted sheet with all the other sheets and duvet over it.
2,Wrinkles,"The Tommy Hilgifer Surfs Up sheets arrived promptly. The pattern and coloring were very nice. The fit was great. So what's not to like? After each washing, the sheets look wrinkled and unappealing. The color did not fade, they did not shrink, THEY WERE JUST WRINKLED so the bed looked disheveled even before sleeping in it. Very disappointing."
5,Great for a surfer theme boys room!,"I love these sheets as my son has a surf themed bedroom. They match perfectly and are cute. They are a tad cheaper than PBKids versions, and good quality too."
4,Nice bright colors,Great sheets...bright colors...if you are not fond of bright colors these mayn't be the sheets for you.
4,Goblin Market is Superb...,"...however, a lot of the other works contained in this short compilation are a bit too feminine for my tastes. Also, unfortunately, a lot of the Judeo-Christian religious references do not exactly ""float my boat."" Goblin Market, though, is an exquisite epic to be enjoyed by all."
3,"Great product, difficult installation",This is my second purchase of the product. I love the locking system. I would rate the lock 4.5 stars. The installation is not that easy. Plan for some extra time to install.
5,Nice lock without batteries,"It is nice lock without batteries like the modern security locks require.ConsBox limits the combo between 2-5 they don't give you any more pins than5. Unless of course you order more.The code doesn't have to be in order and it still works because it's mechanical. So 123 or 321 will work increases the chances of one guessing.You have to drill about 1/4"" hole about 2 inches above a normal dead bolt hole.Means you really can't change it without fixing that hole or getting a similar lock style.Since the lock on the outside is connected to deadbolt I don't know if its possible but seams like it could be you could take a big wrench and just quickly snap that knob open. However you can pretty much break anything with tools but just a immediate thought I had when I was taking it out of the box.ProsNo BatteriesNo KeysNice LookingCan Change code pretty easilyRubber seal for water gets snugThe pros out way the cons for the most part just thought I tell you about the cons."
4,great,"This lock is really convenient, no more drilling locks due to lost keys. It is very smooth for operation and looks cool too. However, it would be nicer if the process of resetting the codes is easier."
3,"Good item, but dented on delivery...","This item was dented and scratched in it's box when delivered to me. It looked like a used part. I installed it anyway, because I was in need. But I suspect the seller on this issue, more than the manufacturer.The item itself is good. It can be a little tricky to hit the right buttons due to the viewing angle of numbers to buttons, in low light. Also, I wish there was a key override."
2,What they don't tell you...,"The advertisement on the internet fails to mention a couple of things:1) The numbers in the combination can be entered in ANY ORDER, exponentially reducing the number of possible combinations. If you choose 2345, you could also open the lock if you push 5432, 3245, any other order of those digits, or if you push those 4 digits simultaneously.2) The lock as purchased only allows you to choose up to 4 digits for your combination. You have to send away and pay more for the other 2 digits."
1,still waiting,I ordered the album on 7/20 and still to this day have not recieved it.I would love to listen to it and post a review but i can't. I e-mailed the seller thru Amazon over a week and a half ago with no responsed.Iam thinking i might of gotten ripped off.
3,Great deal.,"If you love beyonce, you should have the DVD. I like most of the songs. A little bit upset that she didn't dance her ass off like she used too."
5,AWSOME,"If you are a Beyonce fan this are the kind of things you have to buy! is just incredible.if you are not a beyonce fan, BUY IT any way u would experience real music, real passion in all the perfomances, you wont regret it!"
1,Scary Agression,"If you know Beyonce from movies such as Austin Powers, Dreamgirls, and Cadillac Records, you may be shocked by this video! I did not even watch half of it. She is severely agressive, and musically weak. I found the level of rage displayed by her band (and herself) disturbing. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Great tour but expecting too much.,"I think this DVD is a little joke.The private clips are great but I do not understand why many songs have been cut.My questions: where is the full Robot Intro(Sweet Dreams),where are the other Intros? where are Bug A Boo and Jumpin Jumpin between Bootylicios and Upgrade U? Why are many songs so short (Get Me Bodied)?There are some negative things.I think this DVD has a positive and a negative side.Positiv: I Am Tour finally on DVD,private clips,(sometimes) nice shot,great soundNegativ: a lot of things are cut and this is really stu*id.It was thought the entire London show is on dvd.Too early happy."
3,I AM.....satisfied,"I continued to check Amazon to see if anyone would clarify if the DVD/Blu ray was indeed what we saw on the Thanksgiving special that aired on ABC. So let me be the first to say it does differ slightly from what was aired. The television special was edited and terribly if I must say.This Blu ray sounds awesome, but I kept thinking what was the purpose of releasing it on Blu if we have to deal with in and out moments of grainy concert footageand the writing on the top of the screen letting us know what city she is in?We all know Beyonce has talent, she can perform well blah blah blah...she reminds me of janet in her prime. She works hard and I respect her for it.Great Blu for your collection if you're a B fan."
5,Great purchase!,Beyonce took risks and did really well. It is a great show and it is impossible not to feel energized after it. I definetely recommend it!
5,BEEE!!!!!,I F'in loved it!!!! Idkwhat else they want me to type but that how i feel. Amazon never fells or disappoints. I got it in great condition and in perfect timing
5,amazing....,"i love beyonce! this dvd displays the immense talent she has, not to mention her crazy work ethic! i also like the glimpses of her private life, it makes her a little more human.if you are a beyonce fan, i would definitely recommend this dvd to add to your collection!"
3,Mainly for serious bufs of serious films,"The book of Burden of Dreams is a third level of self-reflexivity in action. First we have Herzog's ""Fitzcarraldo"", then we have Blank's excellent film, then we have this book about Blank's movie. Confused yet? For those into ""method"" film making, it's a fascinating read, but not much more enlightening than the films themselves. We get to read journals about how hard it was for Blank's team to watch how hard it was for Werner's team. And, we learn a lot about Blank, who is a treasure as a documentatarian.Fortunately, the stories are worth telling. It's higher minded than, say, ""You'll never eat lunch in this town again"".All have cured me of my desire to visit Peruvian jungle."
2,This is so meta...,"Here it is - a review about how hard it is to read a non-fiction book about how hard it is to make a documentary film about how hard it is to make a fiction film about how hard it is to drag a ship over a mountain. Seriously! The main problem with this book is that we hear the SAME story 4 consecutive times - first in the screenplay to the documentary, then in director Les Blank's journal, then assistant director Maureen Goslin's journal, THEN in a magazine piece. Enough already! I guess this was easier and cheaper than writing a real book on the subject."
4,Buy this MUCH Cheaper from Fisher Price,I am SO excited to be getting this for my 3-year-old son this Christmas. And even more excited that I didn't get it HERE! I just bought the Shepherd's set from the Fisher Price website for just $6.99!!
1,Sent wrong charger twice.,I ordered and sent back this charger twice. I gave the right model number for my phoneand was never able to get the correct charger for it.
4,Cheap but hey it works.,Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item. So far it has worked like a charm. Construction quality is nothing to scream about but all I need it to do is sit on my kitchen counter and charge my three year old spare phone. For that it has worked great. For travel it is very light so it would be good from that perspective but I don't think it would take much wear and tear.
5,"A ""stellar"" full-length","Indie music can be pretty hit or miss. You Shaped Curve, however, is right on the mark. For a band that is unsigned, Matchless has turned out an extremely polished and mature piece of work. Never in a Vermillion Years draws the listener in with sweet harmonies while El Nino takes you on a raucous ride. This album is a must-listen for anyone looking for truly original, authentically delivered indie-rock."
4,Encore! Encore!,Matchless has given us a glipse of what rock is all about. They bring a stunning combination of technical skill and sheer animal drive to this CD. I was grabbed by the tight rhythm and carried aloft by melodic soul buzzing blends. Their music is refreshingly original and stands defiantly in the face of those who would try compare or catagorize it. The one short coming of this CD is appearent only after you've heard them live. But in the mean time...the replay button is activated.
1,Dangerous Cheerleaders,"Some people need encouragement. Regarding our dreams for a 2nd home, most of us are probably stuck in ruts, not knowing how to get out. This book does a good job of helping readers envision the possibilities. Too good a job. They do not present a systematic process for realistically considering what a prospective 2nd home buyer can afford, whether this is even a good idea, the downs of investing (how will you feel after 6 months of no rent in your investment property while still paying the mortgage?) They don't have the reader ask enough tough questions before cheering them on to take this bold and potentially devestating step. Think the dot bomb was rough? How about staring a $2000/month mortgage in the face with no hope of liquidating that property that's worth 10% less than you paid for it! I recommend Investing in a Vacation Home for Pleasure and Profit by James H. Boykin instead."
3,"Good Read, but Leaves me wanting","I like this book, but it left me wanting more. The book does a nice job framing a second home as an investment, but the tax advantages are quickly addressed in chapter two w/o a lot of detail. After one read, I get the general idea, but not all of the implications. Also, the trade-offs of depreciation are only touched on vaguely.However, the book is very readable and uses great antidotal examples (which I found helped me understand the material better). Also, there are lots of references for additional research. This i probably a good introduction into the subject and did leave me with enough information to decide to pursue this idea of a second home a little farther."
2,Deceptive,"I bought this, thinking it would be a whole dvd of Sid the Science Kid, which my daughter loves. Instead it turns out that Sid is only the first segment; the rest are different cartoon characters and stories which did not interest my daughter at all. Disappointing."
3,Decent DVD,"My kids seemed to enjoy this DVD, but the science is pretty simple and I find Sid to be a little annoying."
1,Not For Curly Hair,"I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great. I recently bought another, as my hair is very long and naturally curly (it has to air dry). First of all, this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer, etc., and second, it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy (even with product on it). I'm dissappointed with my purchase, and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried."
5,Great for Long or Thick Hair,"I absolutely LOVE these towels. I got one as a gift years ago, and fell in love with it. I somehow lost track of it, so I replaced it with this one. For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE. It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes. I don't have an issue getting all of my hair into this smaller size (my hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point). However, the towel is left pretty wet after I unwrap my hair, and it takes it a while to dry out. For that reason, I upgraded to the larger 29"" x 55"" size later on. I still use the small one for traveling, or when the big one is in the wash. I've had this one for about 4 years and it's still in good shape. **Remember, don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when you wash your towels - it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent."
3,Didn't notice it drying hair any faster,"I bought this item because I have long, thick hair and my hair dresser suggested I buy a towel specific for drying my hair faster since it takes FOREVER. Well, it arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition, however, I just don't notice it drying my hair any quicker than a plain old towel. It doesn't seem to soak up any more water than before and it's not cutting down on my hair drying time at all. I still use it though because it is a perfect size for my hair. My hair falls halfway down my back and is rather thick and it all fits very nicely in this towel. It's much easier to use than a bath towel that's big and bulky on my head. All in all, it's ok, but doesn't quite get the job done."
4,The towel delivers!,"This towel is definitely an improvement over your regular terry cloth bath towel. It's light-weight & truly does wick the moisture from your hair super fast. I got this towel to try to cut down on the frizzies which I am plagued with, & it has helped with that--not 100%, but much better. I even sleep with my hair wrapped in the towel; it's not too uncomfortable. Overall, I'm very satisfied & would buy another."
5,"great product, fast shipping",GREAT GREAT PRODUCT. I have had one for about 5+ years so it was time to replace it as it gotten a little worn out but I have literally used this everyday for 5+ years. So the fact that it had last that long is amazing. This product came very fast and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a more efficient way to dry your hair.
5,Just ordered one for travel!,"As it works so well, is so light and cuts drying time (I am blessed with really thick hair) dramatically. Ordered it in pink so the hotel maids won't assume it's theirs and ordered another to give my sister - wonderful product."
3,It works,"The towel does what it claims to do. I have thick hair and it drys my hair quickly. The size is right, I doun't think it's too small. But I just don't like the feel of the towel on my skin... It's not smooth. I guess I'm not supposed use it on body because it is a ""hair towel""? I'm just saying if anyone is wondering the feel of the towel."
3,Works,This product does what it says but is not worth the price. May save you 15 seconds of blow drying your hair tops. Wouldn't recommend to anyone on a budget.
2,OK- not noticeable better than a regular towel,"It was Ok. it dries my hair maybe a little better than a regular tower, but it's not noticeable. I've really thick curly hair, so it makes my hair frizzy when i take it off. Most of the time i wear my hair straight so no big deal, but it does not dry much better. if you're on a budget, save your money and buy two cheap towels at Walmart instead"
5,The best towel ever,"Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel - 19 x 39 inchesI have long thick hair which takes ages to towel dry and blow dry. I really needed something to get me out of the house quicker so after some misgivings about the price for a single towel, I decided to give it a try. Am I glad I did because this is one product that lives up to the hype.The towel twists easily into a turban - I wrapped it around soaking wet hair and it felt amazingly light and comfortable. I didn't have to keep rubbing my hair and when I took the towel off a minute or two later it was nearly dry. I didn't have to blow dry my hair for ages either and it feels healthier already.If you have short or fine hair you may not get the real benefit. For any other hair type, I'd say go for it. It'll be a worthwhile investment."
2,dissapointed,"i hate to be one of those people who writes the bad review and brings the rating down but...i'm very dissaopinted. to be honest i was kind of looking for a miracle in the morning; cutting some time out of my morning's 30 minutes just to blow dry. apparently i was wrong. maybe my hair is to long and thick and just can't get it all absorbed, or something. but my thin towel that i've used for a long time does the same thing. i'm trying to find a solution to blow drying it every morning, because i'm sure it can take a toll on it. i'm just dissapointed."
1,Useless,This towel is no more absorbent than an ordinary bath towel. It does a particularly bad job of towel-drying hair. Don't waste your money on it!
1,Not worth the money,This towel does not absorb any more than a regular towel would. It's an overpriced piece of cloth. I actually prefer my old towels to this one for drying my hair.
5,Great product,Great towel. My son is has Muscular Dystrophy and regular towels are to heavy for him. He loved it.ceceq
2,Avoid,"It does not dry my hair a lot faster than most regular towels,It looks dirty after several washes and it smells after two or three days of usage.A regular towel could do better than this."
1,Doesn't Absorb Well And Is Too Small,"The way I measure a product is to judge whether I would buy that same product again. The answer in this case is NO. The towel is too small to contain my just below the shoulder hair (even though it's suppose to be their large towel). It also doesn't absorb as well the regular towels I use after bathing. The only thing I do like about it is that it's light weight. If you have shorter, thin hair this may work for you...otherwise you're just wasting your money."
4,Light weight/quick dry,The Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel ids ideal for those seeking a light weight mini bath towel. It absorbs like a sponge and is completely dry overnight - perfect for my needs (daily fitness activities). I'm happy as can be with this product!
5,Definitely worth every penny!,"Funny because I am the type who always hesitated spending $15 for a Ralph Lauren towel, but have spent so much more for THIS towel and think it's definitely worth every penny. I have long, thick hair and this towel does the trick. I can have my hair wrapped around for as little as 5 minutes and by the time I take the towel off, my hair is no longer dripping or soaked. It's awesome!!! I'm very close to buying another one. :)"
2,A real disappointment,"This towel is not effective for thick hair. It works no better than an ordinary good terry towel. I was looking forward to a product that actually saved significant time by wicking away moisture from my thick wavy medium length hair,but this didn't even come close. Perhaps if you have short, thin hair it might work, but not for my type. Also, it isn't long enough to securely keep in place when you wrap a turban. My advice: Do not spend the money."
5,Natural hair diva,I am so happy that I can stop using old tee shirts to dry my hair. This towel it keeps my hair from getting frizzy!!!
5,I love this towel,"I have three now. 2 white and one blue and one pink. I bought the colored ones, so I would see it in the hotel bathroom and not accidentally leave it behind. It helps dry my hair quickly.....as some of the hotels hairdryers take forever with my thick hair."
4,Helps dry your hair faster,"I like this towel and use it every day to wrap my hair after I get out of the shower. It's lightweight and absorbs a lot of the water in my hair without pulling. Your hair will not be dry after a few minutes with this towel; it will only be less wet. I thought that the towel might completely dry my hair but that is not the case.I noticed some reviews were critical of the towel's ability to contain long hair; my hair is shoulder-length and it's not a problem, but if I had long hair, I probably wouldn't like this towel as much as I don't think I could easily get all my hair in it."
4,A short and lovely Spanish Opera,"This is a relatively short, about an hour, Spanish Opera. The dances are well known, so it is interesting to be able to watch and listen to the whole Opera. The staging is minimalistic and, in my opinion, very effective. The drama is almost all played by Salud (Gallardo-Dumas), and this production is very inventive and in fact Salud is on stage almost all the time. Gallardo-Dumas is a very good actor, and she has to be to respond to the requirements imposed by the director. There are some small changes and variations from the original vision as detailed by the composer, which I think enhances the drama. In terms of the music, I found Gallardo-Dumas voice a little bet harsh, in particular in the high tones. I don't know if this is a result of the sound recording or she sang that way in front of the audience. In any case, I strongly recommend this BlueRay. The dramatization is interesting and profound. The music beautiful, and the overall experience enjoyable."
5,"Extraordinary ""Straight Ahead"" Jazz for sophisticated jazz buffs","If you love ""straight ahead"" jazz played by three extraordinary jazz artists who complement each other incredibly well, then this is a ""must"" CD for you. It swings like no other jazz recording that I've heard for ages. In a way, it could be interpreted as an homage to the old Oscar Peterson Trio. ""Meditation""; ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Beyond the Sea"" are just a few of the standouts on this Grammy-nominated treasure."
5,JUST BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS,"I have been a cross stitch addict for about 30 years and have always been a Sam Hawkins fan. This book is full of designs that really show Mr. Hawkins' skill as a cross stitch designer. From small simple and easy to stitch motifs, to 4 large absolutely beautiful pieces of fine art stitchery for each of the 4 seasons.These 4 (detailed and intricate) patterns to me were worth the cost of the book itself. I cannot express enough the beauty of these designs and found the price to be very much worth it to me. A very excellent selection of designs for all seasons. THANKS AGAIN TO SAM HAWKINS FOR A GREAT DESIGN COLLECTION."
4,So Far So Good!,We bought this for our 9 year old son for christmas last year. He loves it. All the kids from the block come over and ride on it. He is big for his age and fits on fine. My husband even rides this thing. My son has had a few crashes(nothing major/not fast enough) and the razor pocket rocket held up fine. The age guide line could start at 8 or 9 because its so little. We feel this is a great toy and so far worth the money.
4,it's awesome!!!,"i don't have one of these, but i am planning on getting one soon. but seiously, i think it's awesome. if your strong enough, you can pick it up and hug it! it's that small! and that's what makes it cool. if you ask me, a kid my size riding it (i'm 4 foot 9 inches) is like an adult riding a 47 or 49cc motorized one, even the speed of it compares the same too. so dads who think they're a piece of crud and don't want to get one for their kid(s), you're wrong. the're cool, and you should get one. (yes i'm talking to you too dad. yep, it's me, josh, your son.) :-)"
1,Bad brakes on two of them,"Both bikes I purchased have bad brakes, worked on by knowledgeable professional - still unusable due to being unsafe, unreliable. Waste of considerable money."
1,Amazon told me they would pull this product off the shelf!,"I bought 2 of these for my twins. One bike worked, the other not at all. Amazon replaced it nicely. The one I received in exchanged did not work either! Then Amazon told me they would not give me a 3rd one as they needed to invesigate the product. They told me to ship it back. I did; then was told I would not receive ANY refund for the product as it was a few days over the 2 month guarantee. Now I see it still advertised here....good luck is all I can tell you. Amazon, I thought, was a great and fair company to deal with...I will never order from them again. The Razor was defective, but Amazon did not give me any compensation (like a partial refund,even)even after they told me to return it."
3,Great toy for the kids!!,"I purchased this about seven years ago when i was 9 and it was a thrill. It was a good size for me, they're pocket bikes so there gonna be small, check you tube if you need to, although after a few months the battery died and i got about 5 minutes of ride per charge, the speed was fun but it leaves you craving for more. The bike is better for kids, but if its gonna be for a teen i would recommend you buy a gas pocket bike. And most pocket bikes are not street legal, my uncle got a ticket for riding it on the street, or side walks for that matter. Overall its a good bike and lots a fun."
1,Size of item not clear online,I was not pleased with how small the razor scooter was. For the age group and weight recommended I thought it would be perfect for my sone but in receiving the item and allowing my son to sit on it I realized that he could be seriously hurt if he rides it. It really should be recommended to a younger age group like 5yr olds or may 6 not above.
1,this pocket bike sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,do not i repeat do not buy this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!! it sucks you will have it for 2 days and then it falls apart and breaks. you charge it for 5-6 hours and you ride it for 10 mins. that sucks doesnt it. also go for a gas one .even though gas is more dangerous it is still just as dangerous as an electric one. ok so you read what i had to say so be smart and be safe. make the right choise youll be happy garantee it.peace out
1,BROKE AFTER ONE USE,"i was having at fun at 1st and it seems that your real]y going fast but it wasn't .When it was dead i went to charge it. i made sure it was in and left it over night. When i went out with it again and the battery dangled out of center and almost came out and then, to add insult to injury, it just died after a couple minutes. i tried to fix it but its still broken. Disappointed"
3,OK.. it will do,"My 11 year old son has fun, but the bike is really short.It's more for a 7 or 8 year old, or somebody who is small.I'm 5feet tall and my legs were very uncomfortable trying to ride.I wish it was a little taller."
1,don't buy as a gift for x-mas unless you want the surprised ruined.,I am only leaving one star for Amazon's service.How stuipid is it to not pack a gift for x-mas in a box? My son anserwed the door and as clear as day is the pocket rocket not in a box. Thanks amazon. Way to ruin x-mas.
3,why this as a scooters,is this toy unsafe as a kid toy but the toy is very small what if there was a age mix up or a size mix up and the person who it was for hurt there self what would that person do do you ask that ????????????????????????????????????????????????????? if you dont why
1,Disappointing,We bought this product for our 14 year old son to be able to use at horseshows. He only ways 85lbs so he is well under the max weight. He took it outside to try and it barely could get up the mild incline of our driveway. It did not go on the grass at all. I am going to try to return it. We are very disappointed because the specs make it sound like it should be perfect for us.
3,Fun... but way too small,"My friend has one of these things and i was riding it around. it seemed like alot of fun at first but after about 1o min it started to hurt my legs. im 13 but im only 4""11' and it was still uncomfortable. when i got off it was hard to stand up and my knees hurt pretty bad. it is really fun and it seems like you are going faster than you really are because you are closer to the ground wich is really cool. i like it but i woul recomend gettin the chopper because it is more stretched out and comfortable to ride. they go the same speed and the chopper is less expensive. my real rating woule be a 3 1/2 stars but they dont have half stars on the rating thing. i hope this helped!"
5,Its great,"I have this pocketbike and i have to say this thing is a lot of fun. No matter if your riding on flat ground or going down a hill its still fun. I have three electric bikes including this one. One goes 25 and the other goes 20. After getting off those the speed of this one feels just as fast. As for the durability i have had no problems with it and i am 115 pounds. I enjoy this bike very much and i love to ride all the way down my street with my dad and brother while they are riding bikes. I can keep up easily. As far as the price i think it is a steal. I didn't get it from walmart but i did get it at a great price. If you buy it you will enjoy it. The styling is great also. O and by the way, i have had grown adults stop me on all three of my scooters to ask me questions about them and the pocketbike has been the most popular one."
3,Razor pocket Rocket mini bike,"Bought this for my 9 yr old grandson. He loved it and everyone wanted to ride it. It didnt go that fast, perfect for him. He used pretty much daily for a week and then it died!!!. It would not take a charge . He was very unhappy. We called the company and they said they would walk us through troubleshooting. Unfortunately we did not have the bike at our house. >Hopefully we will get this resolved soon! This is the second Razor product and I had the same problem with the first one also."
3,It's ok,I mean its a cool bike its pretty fast for a ''razor''. I would recommend to go too [...] for a whole list of pocket bikes. Because if your like 10-14 years old i woundnt get because its only 15in high (which can be a problem if your tall) and theres only 45 min use of this thing.p.s. I would get a GAS bike.
1,I want to return this terrible item but cannot.,I am not happy about this item. It is very difficult to ride for my 7 year old. I got the MX 350 for my 8 year old and my 7 year old can ride fine on it. The Razor Pocket Rocket is very unstable. I cannot even return it or replace it. How come the Razor Pocket is classified as hazardous material and cannot be returned while the MX 350 can? This is very frustrating and I feel taken.
1,disapointed,"I ordered this item on Dec.18, this was to be a Christmas present for my grand son. this is not a review of the item, I am disapointed when I check the status of my order on Dec.20 it has not even been shipped, but also states it will not arive until after Dec. 25th. this seller should have gotten it out on time. It was advertised super saving shipping for ChristmasRazor Pocket Rocket Miniature Electric Bike"
4,Very small in size but a lot of fun,"We bought it for our office and have been having quite a bit of fun as adults gone wild ;) ! Almost 40-50 folks have taken a ride on this, though it is quite small but thats the fun part !!The only drawback, if you break too hard, the tire leaves a not so easily removeable black streak on the carpet."
4,my kids luv it,"i thought my kids wouldn't like this pocket bike but i was wrong they love it... i got them this bike for christmas and up to now they always hugs me and tell me that this is the best gift ever and that i most tell santa clause thanks... i will recommend this pocket bikes to everyone they are fast and fun to ride and yes i ride it to it was just to tempted... thanks amazon your service was great and i got the bike on the day you guys promise i would get it good job and i will order from you guys in the future,... thanks again."
4,Razor Pocket,My 7 year old loves this bike. It goes alot faster than I expected. My 10 month old tries to get on it all the time.
4,Great Quality! Very fun too!,"Our friends have a razor pocket rocket and they let me try it out. I loved it. Its quality is very good; they've had it for about 3 years now and it is still in mint condition. It takes about 2hours to charge and lasts about 45 minutes.it goes about 15 mph, and is very easy to control.I would recommend this product to kids about 9 years old and up becausethe weight compacity is 220 pounds and anyone under 9 may be afraid ormay not see the fun in this.the cost is pretty low for what you get.I got mine recently for 183 bucks.Overall i recommend that you get this over any other electricly moterized product(I looked for about 1 month and this was the best product i could find for the money)because of cost and Quality.I am 11 years old."
5,Razor Pocket Rocket,"Santa brought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas this year. As parents, we were hoping it was not going to be something that was too fast or too advanced for our son. Much to our delight, it is perfect! Our son loves it, and is very responsible while riding. This is a great age to start!"
4,Just right,"The product is just right for an 8 year old. Should last at least a year depending upon his growth. My 10 year old got one as well but considering he is smaller than the 8 year old, it works. 15Mph does last quite a bit of time before it needs to be recharged. Both kids are 80 pounds or so. The product is perfect for those who can't make the jump yet to the gas Pocket Rockets."
4,love this product,"I bought this for my son for christmas. Several of his friends have them and he has ridden them and he loves it. I like it because it isn't noisy, it doesn't go to fast and it goes in the grass as well as on the pavement. I would recommend this product."
5,Razr Pocket Rocket Fun,"My son is very happy with the bike, I am impressed with it's design and strength. It has proven very capable of handling the weight he carries, about 115 lbs."
4,Razor Pocket Rocket Miniature Electric Bike,"I purchased the bike for my son, 8 years old. He loves the bike and the color except it is very very small (I guess that why it called ""miniature""). The manufacture recommends for the age of 12+, I would not recommend for that age. This bike is good for the age of 5 to 7 of age. I purchased it thru Amazon with free shipping. The order process is very painless."
2,Not feeling the advertised comfort,"I bought this seat because my tailbone would bother me on long rides. I researched different seats, and this one sounded like it would specifically address this issue. At least in my case, it doesn't at all, in fact, my issues are worse. On the factory seat, my wife and I have to stop about every hour or so and walk around. On this one, the pain starts after about 15 minutes.I do like the backrest, but it feels like I'm sitting on a rock, so that cancels out that benefit.It looks great on the bike. I really wanted to love it after spending $400+, and I've been hoping it would get better when it was broken in. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet, and unfortunately, it's too late to return it by the time I've given up hope."
2,Maybe better off buying at store,"Blender worked great- used five times then the glass handle started cracking. So it was almost the 2 month old mark so I know Amazon wouldn't exchange it. They shipped it from Target. Tried to take it/exchange it back at my local Target store. Wouldn't accept it at store, tried the online customer service- no dice because I bought it thru Amazon. Target has a 90 day guarantee but not if you buy thru another retailer.So I am out 50 bucks. Oh well live and learn.Be very careful in choosing what you buy."
3,loved the concent and the product,"I loved the product, i was very sad after 2 weeks when the motor burned out unexepectedly. I called the manufacturer for a return, great bunch of people to deal with. Was very pleased with the customer service and would definitely purchase products again from them. I did not take a replacement on the unit even though one was offered, I took the refund even though I liked the product very much, I was afraid of having another motor burn out."
1,Two of The Three Dumbest Movies Ever Made!,"If you buy the premise that guys in black suits and fedoras are running around guiding your destiny, this travesty of a movie might be right up your alley....Did Matt Damon read the screenplay?Is the studio head who greenlighted this project still employed???"
1,i just can't watch matt damon anymore,i keep waiting for him to quote stalin and it throws me off his characters. at least we got the bourne movies before he went crazy.
1,Small View of God,"Talk about a boring view of God... This movie isn't even consistent within itself. They ""tried"" letting us run things ourselves... Really? Sheesh, don't waste your time."
1,what a waste! for Hollywood and for you!,"stay away*--- don't even rent it.this movie's plot is simple and boring. it's as if some producer was bored and desperate to make a movie. it would have better as a short story instead. nothing happens in it. from the moment matt's character discovers the adjustment bureau, he finds his crush and they run for a few minutes to escape them; until finally finding a brief hiding place on top of a tall magic building. there is no action. instead the (adjstmnt bru, matt and emily) reconcile their differences with the adjstmnt bru-feeling sorry for them and allowing to be--- it's so boring it's pointless.stay away* there's nothing interesting about this movie, well except for the mild coherent connection to God and the universe and all that BS- if you're into that stuff.only watched it because of emily blunt, hence the one shining star.just another crappy movie Hollywood produced from their a*****e."
4,pretty good,"Definitely worth seeing and a fun ride.If you really think carefully about the premise on which the movie is based, it's pretty unbelievable and doesn't make a whole lot of sense.But if you suspend disbelief for the duration of the movie, you'll enjoy a fun and exciting ride..Matt Damon is very likeable as the main character and Emily Blunt is a really good leading lady. She's quite believable as the object of the Matt character's affections.Good pace, interesting storyline."
2,Dumb,"This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I'm surprised M Damon would stoop to such a thin, ridiculous plot, after the likes of Bourne and Oceans. I'm glad I didn't pay full price at a theater for this one!"
3,Great Idea - Flawed Execution,"The premise of this film was 5+ stars.A great idea.But it fell apart in the execution.At the risk of spoiling too much of the movie, I will only point out one odd thing that really struck me.If a group of beings has the ability to manipulate and steer the futures of humans and use ""portal doors"" to get around, it would seem they would be advanced enough to not have to run around to chase people.I was excited when we heard about this film and LOVED the idea of the plot ... but it just didn't come together for some reason.This is an example of a film that would be a good candidate for a remake in 10 years or so --- and hope they can do more with it then."
4,"Good ""Date Night"" Movie","Matt Damon's a versatile actor, and we particularly like him in the Bourne series, but this is a refreshing twist on the usual 'couple falling in love' movie. Though lacking in specifics about how The Adjustment Bureau really works (left up to the imagination), the script is quick-paced, inventive, and ultimately satisfying. I'm not sure if a sequel will spawn from this movie, but if it does, we'll go watch it. Recommended."
5,This movie proves Sci-Fi ain't only for Tech Freaks,"I actually didn't know this was a sci-fi movie based on Philip K. Dick's novella. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be a 'romantic thriller' and I still don't understand what that means. Maybe the 'focus group' thought that a sci-fi label would turn viewers away?In any case, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie with guns/ships/lasers and aliens. This movie stirred the 'romantic' in me and it's refreshing in this era of cynical 'dark' and 'realistic' cinema. It goes past the science jargon and gets to the point quickly. In the end it's about two people who cannot be together due to circumstances out of their control.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have turned in superlative performances and they carry the movie effortlessly. The story is good, the dialogue is crisp and the pace is brisk.Ladies, keep some tissues with you and don't let the mascara run."
5,OMG,"It was so cute! I know, understatement, but I really liked it. The plot, the actors, the everything! But I always had that one question in my mind: ""Why can't they be together?"" and I also wanted to shout to the adjustment bureau ""Leave the couple alone! They belong together! Anyways, I recommend you watch it. Action (I guess you can call it that...?) and romance in one!--and drama! :D"
1,"Shallow, boring movie","Gosh, this was the worst rewriting of Romeo and Juliet I've ever seen. It was embarrassing to watch, even if the actor and actress were dressed up in hipster clothes. Only if you live in Williamsburg, New York City, are you likely to find anything at all to relate to in this boring, slow, poorly written and altogether predictable flick.The only question: Why in the world did Matt Damon ever agree to make it? Surely he's not that hard up?"
1,not so good,"Interesting idea, but poorly carried out by production team and or directors, Mr. Damon struggles to make a story work, some good scenes"
1,The DVD itself is infuriating... didn't get to the movie.,"This DVD forces you to sit there and watch the previews before you can do anything. No skipping to the menu, no changing scenes, no fast forwarding, nothing. Nothing works. I do not want to watch ads for some musical on a DVD I've paid for... I will not be buying or renting any more DVDs from this company."
1,Dear God: please wipe my brain..,"If my brain got wiped I'd never have to think about this piece of cat-gutever again.Now, where was I? Oh, right. I was just about to put this DVD on. It's athriller starring, err...it's a thriller with umm, you know..the film thathas this great scene where this bloke is talking to himself in a toiletand Emily Blunt pops out of a cubicle with champagne and looks really sexyand they snog which is really gross because they don't bother washing theirhands first; and anyway, who wants to snog in a toilet? Disgusting.Now where was I? Oh, right. I was just about to put this DVD on. It's athriller starring, err...you know, wotsisname....."
1,A FRANKFUL BORE,"If you must have this film, wait 'til it's sold for a penny. That's all it's worth. None of it makes any sense, it's the sort of boring viewing which makes you wonder why you're wasting your precious time."
4,It was an original movie,I would definitely suggest this movie. It was an original movie and because of that it was quite enjoyable. Definitely worth the money for the rental
2,One Boring Movie!,I was so surprised how bored I was with this movie starring Matt Damon. I love him and Emily Blunt. I only wish I had waited for cable on this one. I wasted my money.
3,Decent Thriller,"I like Matt Damon and he doesn't disappoint. This is 2 hours of fun. Nothing earth shattering, but I enjoyed it."
2,Disappointed,"I'm usually a huge fan of Matt Damon's movies and the plot of this movie was very promising, but the execution and acting were poor in my opinion. I was pretty disinterested throughout the movie. What a shame."
2,"Very thin plot, full of holes.","Very weak, unbelievable plot. However since we had started watching it we had to finish it! Avoid if at all possible"
4,"The Digital Copy promised expired November 30, 2011","The Digital Copy promised expired November 30, 2011.Movie is excellent, getting both DVD and BluRay is great.Not getting the promised Digital Copy nor advice of it's expiration in negligent and is misrepresents the value vs cost."
3,A spoiler-free review,"Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, this isn't at all the Bourne-esque action-thriller the trailers led me to believe it would be. I don't feel like I can say much without spoiling the plot and some interesting reveals; so, on that note, I'll just say it's a story about faith and faith in love and one's own right to choose how to experience love. The performances were adequate, the concept intriguing, but I never really connected emotionally with the characters as people. The ending was gratifying yet fairly predictable, and I left the theater feeling like I saw an OK film that had missed opportunities to be a great film."
2,READ THE TRUTH!,"simply terrible! Unless you are a female who likes silly romance, this movie is not for you. Mr. Damon usually plays in very nice action films so i made a mistake thinking this is a good thriller."
2,Wait for cable worthy,This movie turned out to be nothing like I thought it was going to be. I will not spoil anything but don't expect to get excited or in suspense during this movie. Not worth money wait for it on cable.
2,Boo,"As a fan of the Bourne series, this was lame. I know it's not Bourne, but the entire premise is too sci-fi for me."
5,beautiful cinema,"This movie is highly recommended. The camera work is certainly poetic and beautiful. The theme of the need to understand responsibility as a means to actually live with free will, is also the hopeful message that the way to find true love is to be responsible as an individual and bring this strength to your marriage...no cheap tricks here!!! Once again a beautiful video."
3,Interesting,"Spoiler AlertI had no idea that the movie had a ""spiritual"" leaning. I dont usually choose movies that contradict Bible teaching. I chose to view this as fantasy rather that possibility."
2,Strange,Matt Damon showed great acting as usually but I just dont get it. Very strange film. I must have missed something.
2,Really weak!,This had potential to be excellent movie but fell disappointingly short... weak plot and Damon con do better. Don't waste your time on this one!
2,Poor attempt at creativity,"I am very surprised by the positive reviews. The movie was forgettable. There was nothing ""deep"" about the concept. There was no reason to care about the two main characters which made it difficult to accept the plot. Their interaction was too silly and unbelievable. The only good thing about the movie was the cool hats. Seriously, that's really it."
2,slowwwwwww,"This was a very slow and boring movie. I was very disappointed with it. And really? Are they serious? ....you have to wear the ""hat"" to walk through their magical doors. :\"
1,Region 2 ( British ) DVD's Don't work in American bought DVD Players !,"I was not aware that a DVD that was made in the United Kingdom, will not work or play at all in a DVD Player that was made & purchased in the United States. That is my difficulty in this order / purchase. It is entirely my fault for the mistake. However, on the bright side, I have seen & really like the movie "" The Adjustment Bureau "" in the past. It's Fantastic & I highly recommend it !!"
2,not what i expected as it was a recommendation,it is a very unusual movie. i just kept expecting for it to have a good plot. never happened. just wasn't my kind of movie
2,Story line just not for me,"The whole story line of who should exercise free will, and ""The Man Upstairs"", or Chairman, as he is called in the movie, just did not strike a cord with me. Liked both Matt Damon and Ms Blunt in other movie roles much better."
3,Predictable,"Indeed, this movie is not for everyone. Same old boy meets girl story dressed up in with a Matrix twist. The ending would or should be clear to any 12 year old. If you have nothing better to do and love a fairy tale ending, then by all means order this one. Yawn"
2,When sci-fi film makers can't gin up a new angle they always resort to...,"A real disappointment if you're expecting something along the lines of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"". The contorted plot line tries to copy the big boys and starts off pretty well, but - like the very worst big-budget fiascos of recent years - it ends up as yet ANOTHER religious-istic, quasi-Xian theme sticking out like a biggole hacked-off sore thumb. I really like Matt Damon and Emily Blunt but they're wasted here. When sci-fi film makers can't gin up a new angle they always resort to good old tired Bible mythology."
2,So many questions,Who else saw the previews to this movie and were not sure how it was going to end before it even started?What did the actors see when the read this script that made them want to do this film?In the end it is a very confusing movie about the over-seers directing our lives and trying to get on the way of true love because it may have a negative effect on the outcome of others. There is a mystery of all of the hidden doors around us that we do not see. I was just sorry I did not find the exit door sooner.
3,Not Bad Worth Watching For Emily..,"This movie is mildly confusing in the beginning jumping from past to present....once you get through about fifteen minutes it pulls you in. The acting is Good. The story is Thought Provoking. The movie felt a little like Heaven Can Wait only with younger actors....and no deaths...just a movie about destiny and fate. I don't think of this movie as one I'd watch ""over and over"". You'll not find yourself mining any gems from the script. However its compelling enough to excite one's curiosity and make you think about ""fate."" Emily Blunt is a very talented lady and intriguing. Matt makes a convincing young politician."
4,Interesting Movie,This is the first movie I rented from Amazon VOD. It's a very interesting movie. Definitely worth seeing a few times.
4,The Adjustment Bureau,This was a very entertaining film. Matt Damon is continuing to solidify his diversity as a versatile actor. This film on life choice and perseverance draws you into the subtilties of the storyline. I enjoyed it.
4,Great Movie,"A good movie that keeps moving, keeps your attention and has an interesting story line. I would definitely watch it again."
5,Great Movie!,"Very creative plot, would watch it again in a heartbeat. If you liked the 1st matrix you would love this movie."
5,Sweet movie!,Matt Damon is one of my favorites. I really loved the plot of this movie; it was really well-done.Nice little twist at the end too with a nice love story intertwined.Entertaining and the acting (of all involved) was excellent.
3,Tweak tweak,"THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, although somewhat underdeveloped, is one of the better Philip K. Dick-inspired movies (this doesn't really qualify as an adaptation as the producers have jettisoned everything except the general concept). It's an intelligent and entertaining movie that successfully blends SF and romance. There's great chemistry between the two leads, and their interactions provide much of the impetus for the movie. The idea is a pleasing, if hugely flawed one, and the script is good enough to carry the dubious logic. It's reasonably tongue-in-cheek, although the potential for greater humour was missed. Good, thoughtful entertainment. 3.5/5"
5,"The Adjustment Bureau, another Phillip K. Dick story brought to life;","I got this as I am updating some of my favorite movies to Blu-Ray. With Blade Runner, the greater resolution brings better skin shading, and a better sense of the immediacy of the actors situation.With the Adjustment Bureau, the sense of ambiance is heightened with the better detail, and the sense of the scenery changes as David moves from door to door to attempt to meet the Chairman brings his dedication to Elise into focus.I am obviously a fan of Phillip K. Dick based movies, so this is a good addition to my collection. On to Minority Report."
3,The Adjustment Bureau,"The Adjustment Bureau was a good movie. It was mediocre. Not the best, but okay. Matt Damon was good in it.."
2,The script is what needed Adjustment,"I can't add Adjustment Bureau to the list of Philip K Dick adapted films that I like. It is rather sappy and also entirely predictable. You know those films where from the beginning you think, ""I hope this doesn't end the the way I'm expecting it to from the first 10 minutes""? Well, this is one of them. I also feel that it fails as an exploration of religion and free will. I hope someone can tell me the short story was better.The acting and production were perfectly competent. But this is an archetypical story that's been told so many times it needs a little something extra for me to be interested these days. Maybe I've seen too many movies."
3,The Adjustment Bureau,"Damon & Blunt have pretty good chemistry, but the script's threadbare treatment of their romance doesn't give them much to work with. On the plus side, I liked the restrained effects work used in the ""space jumps"" through the doors. Terence Stamp is a natural for a MAD MEN guest spot. This should have been called THE ANGEL IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT. +1 for being less annoying then INCEPTION. 5/10"
4,Not too over the top with effects,"I'm not a fan of movies with so much as a hint of religious evangelism in them, but this fantasy thriller goes easy on the faith elements and heavy on the romantic elements so I was okay with it. It's a big budget Hollywood production, and the set values, mostly in New York City, are all real and high quality. There are special effects at work, but very subtle. This is actually a decent movie for thinking adults who can forget their cynicism for a moment and believe in fate, as they call it here. Matt Damon does very well for himself in a role that calls on his acting muscles more than his physical ones, for a change. I did have to laugh at the use of what appears to be an iconic insurance company building in Manhattan as the home of The Man who controls our destinies."
3,Entertaining little movie,"It was fun and interesting concept. A little hokey at times. I liked it but not a great movie, just a nice ez evening."
3,OK. Ending not impressive.,First half of the movie was good and kept the interest level high. But I was disappointed with the ending.
4,Great action love story combo,"This is a good one when you need a movie with a good mix of action and a love story plot. The suspense became less so as the movie went on, almost becoming predictable, but it still held my curiosity to the end. I did become tired of the attempt override a supernatural theme within a corporate context, even though I will give them credit for the unique twist."
4,An interesting proposal about free will!,"The free will is a gift and the way you make use of it will determine your own destiny, no matter how obstacles you find along the way.Through an uneven yarn, the clues will appear one by one until the predictable finale. But the way the raw material of the plot is handled is what it makes the fil worthy to watch.Damon developes a sexual chemistry with Emily Blunt and thanks to a moving script and a dynamic narrative rhythm.Interesting plot, despite of the fact it could be much better due its possibilities."
4,A science fiction fantasy romantic thriller that's clever and fun to watch,"Politician David Norris (Matt Damon) is shown in his unexpected rise to early political success. He's a frontrunner for the New York Senate race, but then an embarrassing photo shows up and derails his election hopes. He's preparing a concession speech and meets a beautiful woman (Emily Blunt), scraps the prepared speech for a spontaneous and genuine one that paves his way for a comeback.It turns out, though, he wasn't ever supposed to meet her again, it was never part of the plan, and when he did someone had to fix it. The ""adjustment bureau"" fixes things, makes things happen the way they're supposed to, according to plans designed by higher ups.It's a very clever idea - as might be expected since the idea came from a Phillip K. Dick story. It makes for an entertaining fast-paced romantic thriller that makes you think (a little bit, at least) about fate and desire and free will. Lots of fun and definitely worth watching."
2,They totally wasted an interesting idea.,Let me get this straight...this movie is telling me God wants another Democrat in the Whitehouse and the love for a woman was the only thing that saved us? Whew! That was close.Emily Blunt has good screen presence but that didn't save this movie.
2,It's a meh movie,"Not a bad movie, but not particularly good either. No climax really. It's so Hollywood-tsy, yet so boring at moments. Was probably inspired by the premise behind Fringe - the ""angels"" wear the same hats as the observers in Fringe, they constantly ""observe"", etc. Unlike Fringe though this movie was too artificial and shallow, and failed to make me believe and identify with the characters. In Fringe love is used as the differentiator, the force that saves humanity, here... meh. Then it has also borrowed stuff from the Matrix - the door-opening to access various route shortcuts, etc. In the end though, it's just that - a sack of borrowed ideas and ""moments"", which were so badly mish-mashed, nothing really meaningful came out, sorry."
4,A Sci-Fi/Romance/Thriller - all in a clever mix,"It is not very often that you will encounter such a movie genre mix like this one. The last such mixture that I stumbled upon was:The Lake House (Widescreen Edition). If you enjoyed the Lake House, you will also like this one.This movie is loosely based on the concept of 'angelic intervention', however, these beings come across more like the agents in the Matrix, but with hats.Although the plot was pretty well written, you get the feeling that more should have been done to raise the level of suspence. A big let down for me was that you never got to see the 'chairman'."
3,Intertaining and different,Unique store that was an enoyable watch. Good acting. May be better for instant video instead of buying to see multiple times.
3,emotionally powerful but not really that good,dont get excited about it being philip k dicksinister ness is lackinggood storyjust powerful emotionally but kinda a chick flick
2,Weird -,"David Norris (Matt Damon) runs for U.S. Senate, loses, but meets a fascinating ballet dancer. But a group of mysterious men using supernatural powers work to keep them apart. It's just too silly and non-sensical to be taken seriously, or viewed."
2,"Cool idea, but needed better script","The premise and acting worked pretty well, but they could not overcome the limitations of the script - perhaps good for a sappy date night rental, but you do not need to own it"

5,Very impressed with the look and information...,"This book has the National Geographic glossy quality and lot of great information! We picked this up for our planned trip to DC. I will update this review when we take the trip. Well, we did the trip and we liked the pictures and information but I found the DK book better for current information and had additional information that this book did not have ....but it was still a good book to get a preview with."
5,Great table set!,"This table and chair set is awesome and very, very durable and well made! And KidKraft has excellent customer service...one of the parts didn't fit well and I called them for a new one and I had it in 3 days for free! They even said if it gets damaged and I ever need any new parts, to call them and they'd send it right away!"
2,So-so table set - fortunately good KidKraft Customer Service,"We found many of the same problems other reviewers mentioned: lousy-quality wood w/many imperfections that reduce its strength, poorly drilled holes that frequently didn't line up well during assembly, etc. That said, KidKraft Customer Service has been good about sending replacment parts, and we won't have to return the table, which our 22-month-old has enjoyed so far. It was reasonably priced and one of few sets that came w/4 chairs -- but if you can afford a better table, I'd buy a different one."
4,"Soft wood, but sturdy","My 18 month old son really likes his table and it is sturdy enough for him to climb on, push the chairs around and cleans up well. It also looks great in the living room as I was trying to steer away from the bright colored ones for that reason. My only complaint, and it is my fault for not mentally preparing myself for this as I should have known, is that it shows the dings from his adventures too. The wood is soft and so it the dents remain from his play, but from afar you cannot see them. I didn't expect it to look ""broken in"" so quickly, but as I said before, I should have considered this as my son is quite active and hands on everything."
2,Disappointed with KidKraft Farmhouse Table & Chair Set,"My husband and I purchased this table and chairs for our grandsons for Christmas (2012) and received a text from my daughter last night that I should contact KidKraft about the quality of the set. She said that it already has numerous indentations and marks on it. We have 2 grandsons but only the 2 1/2 year old is old enough to sit at the table. He has used it to eat from and to play with some of his toys since Christmas (3 weeks). She told me that he hasn't been rough with it and yet all these ""dings"" are showing up on it. I have yet to see it myself but I have a feeling that because it's the expresso color, that any scuffs or indentations will show up even more so than on the lighter colors. I plan on contacting KidKraft and will update this review if they have any suggestions. I am disappointed because I was so hoping this table would outlive us and be used by future generations like the set I have at my house that is 75 years +"
3,Nice table set with great value but poor engineering on the knot on the chair,"We like this table very much because it is stable, durable and good value ($94). We spent about 15 minutes to assemble the table, no problem. But it took us more than 2 hours to assemble 4 chairs. why? Because it is very poor designed. The knot is a circle that turns whenever we put the screw down. And it is very difficult for a circle knot not to turn. That is why I put 3 star for this product. I almost want to return this product, but one of us had the patient to put them together. So only buy it if you have patient to put them together."
3,Wish it was a bigger table,Good for 4 children playing a (1) board game. Do not think 4 children could eat at this table or play individual games
1,"Love it, very disappointed though in damages","Unfortunately, I think this was a great purchase and I've never been disappointed with Amazon until now. I hate to leave a bad review, but I don't see any other options. The product is great, but the packaging and most likely, the shipper were not. I have pictures of the box damage and the internal carnage from shipping, and unfortunately, part of that was one of the chairs being broken and unusable.There were no apparent options as to how I could replace the one chair or receive a partial refund, and also no clear way to notify Amazon directly, so I'm either stuck with three chairs instead of four or I can take them all apart, find a box, pay for return shipment out of pocket, and then hope that the return shipment got here on one piece... in which case I'd have to assemble it all again :-/"
5,play table for my grandsons,This table is exactly what I was looking for. The wood is nice and it was easy to assemble. Chairs are strong enough for me to sit on and work with the children. Of course any chair can tip over so an adult should supervise so that small children don't stand on them. Looks very nice in our family room.
3,Good little table,"PROs:Nice lookingsturdyeasy to put togethergood price for a table and 4 chairsCONs: The top was a little scratched on arrival. I would have sent it back, but I knew my kid would distroy it in a day anyways.the table is a little small, the whole set is supposed to be for kids up to 8 year olds, but my kid is average in size at age 4 and he fits just perfect, so I can't imagine this table being used for more than a year or two. There is no way an 8 year old can sit in those chairs.If it wasn't damaged on arriaval and if they stated the ages were 2-6 I would have gave it a better rating. It's a little misleading since I'll only get a year or two out of the set instead of the 3 I was hoping."
2,Beautiful but not durable,"I bought this table for my two year old. I absolutely love the look of it-- the dark finish matched the rest of my house :D However, after about a week, already looked like an old table with all the scratches and knicks. The wood is very soft. It is perfect as far as height for my little tot. Just wish it could take more wear and tear"
4,great kids table,"after combing table/chairs sets for my 2 year old and their reviews, i settled with this one. total pain in the butt to put together, time-wise, but the overall style and durability make it worth it. great table. my 2 year old is still a bit small for it but she'll grow into it nicely."
3,The product is ok but I was expecting better quality.,"It didn't take very long to put together and looks so cute! Once my daughter (16 months) started using it, it had dents all over within a day. The item is made of very soft wood and any bump leaves a mark. Thankfully we got the light colored table so you can't tell too much. I definitely would NOT recommend the expresso colored table. In addition, the back to one of the chairs is getting loose (no...it has nothing to do with the screws). Again, the table is ok. Had I seen it firsthand before purchasing, I wouldn't have made the purchase."
3,quality could be better,the finish on the table top was not very good and there were huge scratches/indents on two of the seats.
5,A MUST HAVE for any family of small children,This is an awesome table that we keep in the dining area. Our kids sit at this table most of the time right next to our big table. They go over to it and do their drawings and painting and homework and insist on sitting there at meal time. It's also very good for when we have guests so the kids can have their table and the adults can have theirs. It's small enough where it sits in the corner very nicely. One thing... the chairs WILL NOT SURVIVE when mom backs over one of them... take it from me.... that chair was smashed.
5,NE SCREWS,THE DESK WAS GREATTHE OBNLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT IT CAME WITHOUT HTE SCREWSIT TOOK ALMOST 2 WEEKS TO GET THEM
3,Nice but....,"I was very excited about this set. But as we started to put the chairs together we noticed the first one wasn't completely stained. For some reason a 50 cent piece on one of the legs has no stain on it at all and it completely stands out. So disappointing. Other than that, the structure itself is very good."
5,Great Table/Chair Set,"I decided to purchase this table/chair set after much research on-line and some in-store shopping. From what the reviews stated, it was the best one on the market for the price. I was excited to receive it a few days after purchasing and once the hubby and baby (17-mo old) put it together, I was very pleased. It is very solid and looks great. Definitely a good quality table and durable chairs for the price compared to the ones I checked out in the store. I highly recommend this purchase."
4,Great table and chairs,"We bought this set for my daughter and she loves it. She is not quite 2 and she sits here to eat, color, practice drinking water out of a cup, etc. So far it seems pretty durable (she likes to sit the chair on its side and sit/stand between the legs) and my husband had no problems putting it together."
1,VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS ITEM,"This table & chairs set was purchased because of the high ratings given by previous buyers. This was a Christmas gift for my twin grand children and it is not suitable for them to use for years as advertised. I am totally dissatisfied with the quality of the material used to make the table & chairs - very ""soft"" wood that marks easily with a finger nail & the table arrived with a crack in it!! Complained to the seller, sent pictures of the damage & received a new table top ONLY that was of the same poor-quality so-called wood. To get a new replacement that would hopefully be better I would have to pay shipping to return the defective set! Not very good customer service and really crappy product. Would NOT EVER recommend this product or seller to anyone!!! TOTAL WASTE OF $100!!!!!"
2,Smaller than I thought it would be,"I wasn't very impressed by the table and chairs. It was so much smaller than what I thought. It looked the correct size in the pictures, but in person it looks very miniture, almost like a doll's table and chair set. My daughter who is almost 2 will outgrow this set quicker than I'd like. It's good quality and the espresso color looks great, but the size of the table and chairs is a disappointment. This should be priced half of what it is. I think over $100.00 is overpriced for this item. Not very happy with this purchase."
2,Very cheap. Not good for children,"Sadly, my return window expired before I actually opened the product (I bought it for a holiday gift in Oct. and didn't assemble until the holidays)My children (a 2 and 4 year old) had this set so dinged up and scratched in 1 week from just using it to eat on that I was really shocked. The wood is very lightweight and very, very easy to muss. There was a giant gouge in one seat from a snap on a pants pocket! Not at all worth the $. I bought this thinking it would last until they were old enough to sit at the ""big"" table, but it looks so junky and it's only been in use for a month-I will be replacing it as soon as I can save the money. It's way too expensive for how easily it is damaged. If something is made in a child size, it should be able to take a little wear and tear easily. This has been in use for 1.5 months, and looks as if it's been used in a daycare for a year."
2,Chips very easy,"My wife bought the table for her in home daycare to replace a metal card table type kiddy table. I was afraid the wood might not hold up as well as medal. So far I'm not too happy with the wooden finish of the table, it chips very easily. We have 3 kids all around the age of 2 that eat breakfast, lunch and snacks at the table 5 days a week. The strength of the table and chairs seem to be ok for now, but its only been a month so we'll see how well it holds up over time."
2,After a year of use...not impressed!,"We decided to purchase this table for my 18 month old daughter (at the time) last year (2011) for Christmas. We were so excited to set it up and have her use it. It was great for about 6 months, now after a year of use, the finish is chipping horribly, the chairs are falling apart and it was not at all as durable as I had hoped. I would advise paying the extra money for a more sturdy durable activity table. Buyers beware if purchasing for a busy toddler, no chance in it lasting over a year."
2,table is ok. it is not sturdy at all and it scratches easily.,"I bought this table for my 1 1/2 old son. It was much redder that it looked in the photos. Also, it's very light-weight wood and not very sturdy. Lastly, the finish on the wood has already chipped off in several spots, and we've only had it a month. I woudn't recommend this table. If I were to do it again, I'd save the money to buy a better table, like the one from Pottery Barn Kids."
1,Piece of junk,"This table and chair set had soooo many problems. The table top had a huge split running down the entire width of the table. Assembling the chairs was a disaster as the pre-screwed holes are uneven and inconsistently sized throughout, causing all of the chairs to rock from side to side and in a bad way. Our daughther even slipped off the chair because the unevenness/rocking was so severe. The wood seems very soft and had several cracks near the pre-screwed holes. I'm definitely returning this piece of junk.I just don't understand all of the glowing reviews. I suppose if you're going by looks alone, it is a handsome set, but the construction and quality is CRAP."
4,Looks great - we love it - but it scratches easily,We bought this table for our 20 month old son and he took to it immediately. Looks great in our living room and was easy to assemble. Furniture is sturdy. I must criticize the finish on the table... it scratches remarkably easily (my toddler managed to make his mark within a week). But I would still recommend the product.
4,Durable structurally but scratches easy,"Great product, beautiful but scratches easily. I bought it for my twins (2) but my 6 year old can also sit comfortably. All they do is eat on it and the table top already has scratches. If they played games or toys on it, it would probably be scratched more. Easy to put together! I did it by my self in under an hour. Once I figured out the first chair, it was a breeze after that (no written instructions, only pictures but a little hard to follow - but easy enough to figure out)! I'm happy with my purchase!"
5,Great toddler table,"20 month old daughter loves this table. Great for coloring, reading, snacks or meals! Sturdy enough for us to join her. The color matches our kitchen table which she loves."
4,Could be a tad more stable,"Likes:Very easy to put togetherVery easy to cleanFour chairs for a great priceDislikes:The table is a bit light so it moves a lot.Chairs are also light so when getting on and off they tip over easilyTable is a bit small for four chairs.Overall a good purchase for us. If you're looking for something to last for multiple children you may want to splurge on something a little more ""solid"". Just the right height for my 18 month old (who is 95th percentile in height). I could seem him quickly outgrowing it though."
4,Quality kids table and chairs,"This kids table and chair(s) set was received in excellent condition. Care was taken to ensure it was received without scratches, dents or any physical damage. The quality of this product is outstanding with easy to assemble instructions. I would highly recommend this product for 2 -5 year olds."
5,Great Set!,"I have owned this table for my child for over a year. He is now almost 3 and this table still has room for him to grow quite a bit more. He is also very tall and big for his age. Over the past 1.5 years, he has eaten most meals here, colored, paiting, climbed, dragged it and the chairs around, etc. all the things toddlers do and this table and chairs have held up so well. They clean easily and are very sturdy. Anymore it is hard to find things made well and that don't break down. When we were shopping for a table and chair set it seemed like this was all we came across. We gambled on this one and it was a great choice. I would buy it again and again and I would recommend this to others for sure!!!"
4,Perfect toddler table,"I absolutley love this little table! It is perfect for my 19 month old to sit down and eat dinner or to do draw and paint and do arts and crafts,. He uses it everyday and I think he likes it a lot. We had the Little Tykes picnic table and he would fall off because the attached benches were not spacious enough for function. I am very happy with this table and the price on Amazon was unbeatable. The same table with just 2 chairs was $150 at a local toy store in New Orleans. I got the table with 4 chairs for $108 free shipping, no tax on Amazon. My only negative is the screws are visible. The wood is super solid and strong. I just do not think things are made like they used to be. Why leave the screws exposed? I got over it. Love it!"
5,Worth the $$,"After a lot of research and reading reviews, I decided to get this table set for my 19 month old grandson. I am so happy that I paid the extra $$ to get this! My grandson loves it so much.It arrived less than a week after I ordered it, no pieces were missing, nothing was broken and it was extremely easy and fast to put together.This is a sturdy set, my grandson loves climbing on it and sitting on the table. Best of all, it's the perfect size for him and it will last for years. I was concerned about getting a set that had unstable chairs but this is made of solid wood and he has no problem getting into/on the chairs.I have recommended this set to my family and friends."
4,Kids table set,"We love this table and chair set. The only down fall was that they used a pen on it, and it won't come out. On other tables, the pin did come out. It's very durable. Adults in our family sit on the chairs and they hold up great. It was a pain to put together. The screws were a little hard to handle. Overall it is a quality solid wood product that I would buy again."
5,Fabulous set for the $,"I was looking at a much more expensive (double the price) set at a well known high-end retailer... My friend has that set and this one (espresso) looks identical, PLUS has 4 chairs instead of just 2! It's lovely in my kitchen, matches other furniture and my daughter loves it. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. We couldn't be happier with it. My 2 yr old daughter colors, paints and eats every meal at her ""big girl table""."
5,Great Set,I ordered this table and chair set for my grandkids (ages 2 & 4) who live with me and it was one of the best purchases I have made. We have had the set for over a year now and the quality is fabulous. It is something that gets used everyday. I would most definately order Kidcraft again.
2,Looks great but is really cheap!!!,"When putting this together I thought it was very sturdy and durable. After less than a week of using this product the finish already started to peal off. I took the time to polyurathane this product in hopes it would protect it from the cheap finish. This has helped a little bit but the finish is terrible. If you are looking for a product with good quality, this is NOT the product you want."
5,Great quality,"This table is not only great quality for the price, it's just great quality in general. Easy to put together, sturdy, easy to clean and my 3 year old loves it."
3,Chairs were broke,The table is great and for the most part easy to put together. Everything went together with ease until the last chair. The whole for the cam was too big and the cam spins instead of the screw moving. Now I am stuck. Can't get the chair put together and can't get it apart. Called customer service for the manufacturer to only be on hold for close to hour and kept getting disconnected before I ever spoke to a person to explain the problem.
4,Perfect Table and Chair Set,"As with other reviews, I too am happy with the quality of this product. I've ordered other KidKraft toys with great success; it's reassuring to know they consistently produce top-notch items. The color shown is a true representation of what you'll get. It looks fantastic with our decor. It's the perfect edition to round out my 2 year old granddaughter's kitchen play area. Now she can cook and serve her meals for all to enjoy. I know she'll get plenty of use from it over the years to come."
4,Good Little Table,We got this table for our 15 month son. The chairs are just the right height for him to be able to climb into them. The table feels sturdy enough that he will be able to bang away and not cause it much harm.The chairs are sturdy and I (being 190 lbs) can sit in them without the fear of breaking them.We've had the table for about a week and it is exactly what we wanted and expected.
4,Tema muy bien tratado,"La eterna pugna entre la libertad de la madre de disponer de su cuerpo y el derecho a la vida del feto.Me parece que fue tratado con mucha seriedad y la manera en la que razona su voto el Ministro de la Suprema Corte, en la que involucra ambos derechos, ambas libertades, sus implicaciones; pero las liga con el derecho a una vida digna de los niños no deseados, creo que fue sensacional.Realmente la recomiendo."
3,"Fun to play, but over too quick",My first Nancy Drew game and I thought it was fun.It was just over too soon. I wish they had more levels and perhaps each time you play the game some options would change so it isn't always the same ending. Overall I did like the game play and if I had to I would buy it all over again.
3,Fun while it Lasted,"I got this game for Christmas and was excited to play it, I loved playing it but I finished it in one sitting. So it's fun if you want a quick game but if you want one that is tough and long and hard don't buy this one."
1,Over before it starts....,"I'm a huge fan of Nancy Drew and wanted so badly to love this game. Alas, it was not meant to be. By the time I figured out some of the mini-games, (which you can beat by randomly banging on buttons) Nancy is solving the mystery and its over.The dialogue screens become really boring with the same image flashing over and over again.The one thing I found fabulous with this game, was that Nancy, in not so many words, told her boyfriend she wasn't giving up solving mysteries to dote and spend all of her time with him... I had to laugh... the original Nancy Drew from the 30's packed her dad's revolver, they kept that same spunk by letting the boyfriend know it wasn't always about him."
2,Too short,"We bought this game for my daughter for Christmas. We gave it to her about 1 o'clock and she was done with it before dinner. That's too short a game for the money. She didn't even play it for that whole time, either."
1,Might be ok for kids,"Like the previous reviewer, I'm hooked on the Nancy Drew PC games and pre-ordered this one. There is no challenge to this game at all, you walk through rooms and everything that you are supposed to see is highlighted. The mini games that you play to make characters more willing to talk are extremely easy. It might be an ok game for a child, but if you're an adult and want something that even remotely resembles the Her Interactive PC games, don't waste your money on this."
1,HATED IT,"I Purchased this game and I wish I hhadn't It is soooo easy and when the mystery is solved thats it. I even wrote to the maker of the game to ask if this was a joke and maybe there was some kind of hidden games, they never responded. now i know why. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! DON'T BUY THIS GAME"
5,Great for younger Nancy Drew fans!,"I bought this game for my 9-year-old daughter. Her older sister & I enjoy the computer Nancy Drew games, but they are a little too hard/scary for my youngest. She really enjoyed this game -- it is perfect for the girls who want to play the other games, but aren't quite ready. It took her a few days to complete, and was just challenging enough that it kept her interested, but not frustrated."
1,This game sux.,"It's bad. If you want to play a fun DS detective game, get Touch Detective. With this game, it's hard to manuever around - you have to use the + keys, not the touch screen; it's mostly reading - not much sleuthing; the games are easy - like 5-year-old easy; everything is highlighted the minute you walk into a room. The touch screen is hardly used! The PC Nancy Drew games are fun. This one is a dud and a waste of money. I pre-ordered hoping it would be good. Blech."
3,Not like the PC game,It is a cute game but no where near as exciting as the PC games. I hope that they figure out a way to make it more like those.
2,Very little to do - Games Plays it's self,"I play the Nacy drew PC games and thought the DS games would be just as fun. They are, at least this one isn't. It felt like the game was playing its self."
2,A word of warning....,"I just thought that I'd jot a few words to let people who are interested in owning this figure know a few things.....First of all, it's 2 figures...there is the Tree-like Blair Witch, and the Zombie Blair Witch. The packaging and promotional material make no mention of that fact. I ordered the figure assuming (and rightfully so...) that I would be getting the Zombie figure I had been seeing for months in all of the print ads. Not so.....Second- I can't speak for the durability of the figure I REALLY WANTED, But the Tree Witch figure broke in 2 places as soon as I had it out of the box. It's VERY frail, and the hands are really easy to break.I'd advise buyers to beware...."
1,"""Hey, the Blair Witch isn't in the movie!""","That's what most people will be thinking when they see this new toy sculpture from the popular Movie Maniacs line. This is Todd McFarlane's personal vision of what he imagined the Witch to look like. Not being a fan of the film, I can't say if it's what I imagined, but McFarlane completists will want it, even if it is a bit wooden [ha!]. I'd stick to the Terminator in this series though, that's the keeper in this line."
4,Handy Guide,This is a very helpful guide to a vexing issue. The book is a very easy read and has a good bit of great information. Its only drawbacks are dated material and the habbit of rapid topic switching by the author. Neither issue is overly vexing but the latter dose require the reader to pay special attention at times.
3,tennis racket,This is a bit boring and my 8 month old got bored soon. At 1 year and 8 months she is still bored with it. Though it lights up and looks good.
1,This film is a waste of your time and money,Simply put it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
4,Very fun and cute,"I just happened to rent this out of the blue, and was pleasantly suprised. This doesn't have the biggest budget obviously, so the dance and song numbers can be underwhelmingly. But it makes for a sweet romantic comedy with a little bollywood fun thrown in. If you liked Bride and Prejudice, then you'll like this bollywood-lite film also."
4,West Side Story with a happy ending.,"This movie is suprisingly engaging. Though a simple plot, the subject matter is timeless. The movie was done tastefully and unlike American similar movies, done without sex and violence. Nice music, uplifting and entertaining."
2,It wasn't what I had thought it was.,"Unfortunately, this product was not what I thought it was going to be. I saw it and it just was what I had had in mind or what I understood."
3,it fulfill the need,"the scale is a bit odd, steps of 1.4 .... mmm kind of a design flaw, i was expecting something more like steps of 1 or 10... but it works"
3,"Good wrench, bad lower end torque","I bought this wrench with the intent of using it to torque my carbon fiber racing bicycle. While it does just barely make it to the torque specs I need, it does not go any lower than this so I can't torque my bike to a slightly lower tension than the max allowed."
5,A genre classic,"This is one of my favorite movies and a classic in the genre.Just watch it to be entertained, watch it to see an incredible imagination or really delve into the themes and questions it raises. I love the story line and the ""dirty realist"" approach to some off the strange settings and places.You can appreciate this movie on a number of levels, its story has ever twisting interesting events and the ending is a real surprise."
4,Memory foam,"This was a gift for my Uncle and Aunt, they loved them and sleep well on them. They were delivered on time ."
4,Good Paper Airplane book,My 9-year old daughter really enjoyed this book. She built all the airplanes and she included information on the aerodynamics in a book report. She is also happy to be able to use the right vocabulary when talking with her pilot grandfather.
2,"A lot to like, but not what I'd hoped it would be.","I suppose that it is what it is, and if I went in expecting it to be something else, then the problem is mine. But I'd thought there would be at least some footage of the Mats, maybe a bit of their music, even if both were de-emphasized. I should have done some research outside of watching the trailers, though I guess it should have occurred to me then that neither would be present in this film.Watching this film is a lot like sitting at a bar while someone who knew a famous guy tells you all about him. Technically it's great, it's assembled with care and well-edited. Grant Hart's interviews in particular are a real treat.But an hour and a half of that? I don't care who the chatty guy at the bar was, I'd have told him to shut up or just walked away mid-wistful recollection long before that.I can't think of a situation where I'd watch it again, and I wish I'd have rented it instead of buying it."
4,"Great movie, but a different spin on a documentary.","This movie is definately not for those who want to see interviews from Paul, Bob, Tommy, Chris and Slim. It's also not for those who want to see footage from shows or hear their music. However, it is a great look at the band and how they have impacted so many people. The Mats were never a huge band, and yet they have a strong following and influenced so many other artists and fans. The footage of other fans is really a neat way to know that there is a community out there who was as influenced by the music as I was and am. I would not recommend this if you want to crank the volume to 11 and hear Hootenany, but it's a great way to remember the band and the times you had with their music."
5,Great movie about an amazing band,"This film is an absolute must see for any Replacements fan. Neither the band members nor any of their music appears in this film. Instead, the story of The Replacements is told entirely through those who knew them best - their friends, their fans and their contemporaries. Throughout the film, you get the history of the band from those who were there seeing them in the early days, and the stories about the band from those who were there to witness their antics. It's a really well done film that's a blast to watch again and again."
3,This was fun - but would be better if The Replacements were in it,"It was great to learn so much about the early days, but it feels like half a documentary. Replacements performance and interview footage would have made this a home run. That said, there is so much to learn in the first hand stories about the band that are found here. Plus, the behind the scenes drama that only the insiders featured in this film could share is worth the price of admission. If you like The Replacements, then see this, just don't expect to see footage of the band.Best reason to watch this? Grant Hart and Greg Norton from Husker Du are in it."
5,Incredible documentary for an incredible band.,"The Replacements are, in my opinion, the greatest band ever and this film did them justice. From the time it starts to when the credits end, Color Me Obsessed had me riveted. The interviews are great and are funny one moment, moving and poignant another. I have been raving about this movie to whoever will listen."
2,A Good Idea with Poor Execution,"I watched this once and enjoyed parts of it. The filmmaker utilized a lazy and unbalanced approach and it shows. He uses the same graphic over and over in between scenes which becomes a headache almost immediately. One of the most annoying facets being his audible talking over crucial interview subjects. For a fan of the group this is worth watching, but this high school film project may not be worth the sticker price."
1,No Replacements Here,"No Replacements music (not a note). No Replacements (not one single band member represented). No photos, no nothing, just a bunch of yappers talking about how much they were fans. Bar none the lamest ""documentary"" ever made. Crap."
1,Boring,How could a film about one of Americas most raucous bands be boring? Let's start with the fact that there's no Replacements or their music in this thing. Some have called this an amazing choice. I call it idiotic. You REALLY have to want to watch hours of people just talking about them to enjoy this. I'd prefer THEM telling us about heir careers. I'd have thought they could have licensed a few of The Mats better songs. They thought there was no need for music in a film about music. Figure that one out.
5,Great Vest,"Bought this last weekend because I was sick of digging in my old vest pockets for items. This vest has so many different pockets, hangers, hooks that you can customize it to however you want to fish. Also, having two fly boxes built in is great if you, like me, fish two different areas regularly. Fits great over my waders. I use one for the tailwaters and one for the mountain streams. Overall, great quality and I am sure I will get years of use out of it!"
5,I'm gonna find out,I read this book and it is GREAT! I'm sure that I can succeed with Asian women now. I'm going to find out if that sideways thing is true.
1,NO NEED TO READ THE BOOK!!,You don't need a book for this bs! The trick of getting Asian chicks is to simply master the art of cooking a delicious meal. No Asian can resist a lunch special combo of General Tao with a bowl of fried rice!
1,yeah whatever,"You be amazed about what you can write about. This book is just nothing but cheap stereotypes. The world is simply too broad and has too many types of people for one single personality to come out. Unlike most asians i'm not going to go onto a Tirade saying ""Yeah those Asianphiles they are rejects from White society that's why they have to hit on our women"" It's just not an accurate book. This dating guide is like a lot of business books out there. They will give you strategies but no book can ever help you get a date or make money. It's all you and your confidence. This is just as inaccurate and low depth as the Asian men guide to dating white women. Books like this are going to offend people no matter what. If anything this book is more of a joke gift for a friend. It really shouldn't be taken seriously."
2,"This book shoulr be called ""How to date Asian-American Women","Having lived and worked in Asia for 15 years, China, Hong Kong and Singapore, I can tell you there is no secret to meeting women here. Any idiot with even a minor ability to listen and understand how people interact with one another is different here from the US will get by just fine as far as meeting women - better so than in the US! That said, Asian-American women, in my epxerience, are totally, totally different. Most of them are more Westernized than Asian, so interacting with them the way you would any other American woman usually works fine, in my experience. I also wonder what the author means by ""Asian."" The continent contains many nationalities (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, etc) each as different from one another as Westerners are from them. An patronizing book at best, a dumb white man's guide at worst."
2,More Cosmo-type BS,"I bought this book because I like to check my friend's competition .... I expected to get a bunch of ""be romantic/be a nice guy"" BS advice, and I wasn't dissappointed. If you want to be taught how to act like a chump, and possibly get walked on like a doormat, then this book will help you. Otherwise, you're better off buying a book like ""Nice Guys And Players"", ""The Machiavellian's Guide To Womanizing"" or ""How To Suceed With Women"".Women, whether they're Asian or not, operate in similar ways. You're not gonna find much in here that will help you-- unless of course you want to become the man who wines and dines the woman, while another guy wines and grinds her for you."
1,"""The Asian Mystique""","I had never heard of this book until I saw it advertised on Amazon as part of a package deal with The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, & Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient (Hardcover) by Sheridan Prasso.Bravo to Amazon! Sheridan's book should definitely be required reading for anyone considering this one."
1,Terrible advice; useless,"This book danced around the obvious answer of how to attract an asian woman: be born any non-asian male, in particular be born caucasian. Asian women will literally jump at the sight of you, worked for me. The book did not include the aspect of race into the equation which DOES matter in today's American society if you look at the statistics."
2,Only true for Asian American women,"The advice she gives seems to be centered on Asian American women, whom I don't really consider Asian, the same way George Bush isn't an Englishman. Ming Tan, please rename yourself Amy.Regarding all the hatred spewed forth against us asiaphiles by the coalition of Asian American boys who can't get laid and other assorted racists, don't think you are stopping even one of us from pursuing the women we adore, it just spurns us on, because it's really enjoyable to see you pissed off."
1,"Pretty, Pretty Pathetic",Where is the companion volume (for the ladies): How to Repel Creepy Losers Who Bought That Ming Tan Book!
1,Get A Life! A bunch of sterotype that degrade Asian women!,"I cannot believe that anyone wanting to buy this book that promotes stereotype of Asina women. I have read the book and I almost die laughing. If you acutally believe that most Asian women are ""shy and submissive"" as the book suggests, go ahead and take charge. See what the Asian women would do. One advice (I assume this book is aming at the White Male Population) treat every women the same way no matter what nationally they are. One more thing, who the hell still drink tea (quote ""Asian women take tea seriously.."") in this century."
1,Newsflash --,"Asian women are not all the same. I know, what a concept, right? We all have different personalities, family backgrounds, interests, thought processes, and goals in life. Stop fetishizing us so much and start thinking about what you can do to make yourself desirable before buying this book so you can snag an Asian chick."
5,Very Pleasing Translation,"I like the way Stephens includes enough information about Ryokan to help understand the poetry. As Ryokan notes himself, outside his Zen, he has no Poetry to offer.Ryokan refusing to take a position of a Zen Abbot, instead goes back to the place of his youth and takes hermitage. ""The cold wind gathers enough fallen leaves to build my fire.""His code of living avoids flattery as much as objuragation, he teaches with a tear, plays with children, and falls in love with a young nun. All of this brings forward our own starkling humanity!Stephens does a master presentation in bringing this material together in such an artful way as to illuminate all sides of Ryokan with that of the reader themselves. And with that the poetry comes alive."
5,Great Story-Sweet Romance,"This is an excellent book! The romance in this trilogy is very sweet. People who like the couple being together from cover to cover might not enjoy this book. Warprize is a very well crafted story that will appeal to romantics who also like world building, a strong story, and interesting characters. A good portion of the book goes by before Kier and Lara really meet. I like the couple to meet sooner but the author makes this story work for me.My favorite story is one where you get the hero and heroines point of view. This is told from Lara's view only (I did miss the male point of view this is preference on my part).The ending was somewhat abrupt for me but that is fine because there are two more books on this couple. I really LOVE when authors take a couple through more books.The books were already waiting for me.I really enjoyed this I plowed right through it!"
5,Refreshing,"I found this book refreshing and enjoyable. The main characters are Keir the Warlord who is powerful, honorable, intelligent and stubborn and Lara the Warprize who is gentle, caring, just as intellegent and just as stubborn. What makes their story so enticing is that Keir is tough and rough when he needs to be but so gentle and tender with Lara.The secondary characters are just as great and enjoyable. They help enhance the plot and make the main characters more interesting. I loved them all. My favorites being Gils, Atira and Simus.The author has a gift with words and she draws you into the two diifrerent cultures she has created (Xyians and Firelanders). I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it."
1,Girl betrays entire country; does well for herself,"Even leaving aside the wooden stereotyped characters (the young male assistant who wants to be a healer is the perfect example), I really couldn't get beyond the fact that this woman betrayed everyone she knew and loved to an invading force because she thought the leader was hot. Yes, the current leader was mean to her (Oh no!), yet most would feel that opening your city gates to an invading army is a bit of an outsized response. Luckily this army was unlike any army ever. I was not a bit surprised that women like her are highly prized by her new countrymen (apparently a chick linch pin that can bring down a whole city state is common in this universe), but I was appalled that they were going to let her into their own capital."
3,Could be better!,"I found this book to be good, but it often lagged at parts. Wanted to scream hurry up! The romance parts were not very enjoyable and she spend more time with the other characters than with the lead. I will give the second book a shot, maybe it will be better."
4,Good fantasy romance,"Warprize is the first book in a trilogy about Lara and Keir. It is also Elizabeth Vaughan's first novel. I applaude her imagination and writing style. This is a quick and enjoyable read about two warring societies in a fantasy kingdom. There is good romantic tension between Keir and Lara, but nothing too sensual or ""over-the-top"". He is quite protective of her, but she is fiercely independent. I will read Warsworn next and look forward to the 3rd book in the trilogy."
5,Amazing! A keeper!,"I LOVED this book!! Excellent and very creative plot and characterization, as well as sizzling romance. Can't wait for the sequel, Warsworn. But in the meantime, do not miss this book. It's definitely a keeper. This author has a very bright future ahead of her."
5,Great Book!,"I came online specifically to see if Elizabeth Vaughan had written anything else. I would have ordered it tonight! Sadly, I found out it was her first romance. A great read. Keep them coming Elizabeth, you are on my ""Must Read"" Author list."
4,Enjoyable Romantic Read,"This is a lovely romance, set in Medieval times, between a female medical/ healer and a male Warlord. The language makes it appropriate for young adult and teen readers. Nothing graphic. I was pleased with the intelligence and courage of the woman most of the time, but I was annoyed when she refused to believe her brother was trying to kill her, even though the evidence was clear. This wasn't great the way I feel about other young adult novels: Harry Potter or Twilight (by S. Meyer). But I enjoyed it enough that I plan to read the next two books in the trilogy: Warsworn and Warlord."
4,Superb storytelling!,"4.5/5.0There are books we read for suspense, some we read for the beauty of the word, other's to pit our minds against the authors to solve a mystery. Then, there are some that encompass the very reason books exist... the story. That, that has existed since time began, one person imagining worlds and people and love and trials to rise above, then weaving them into a story to entertain and to teach, the kind people used to tell at bedtime to capture the attention then ponder while drifting off. ""Warprize"" is a consummate example. The beauty of the book is simply in the storytelling and Vaughan is it's most gifted sage.Xylara is a princess who chose to become a healer rather than rule. Keir is a Warlord intent on conquest. He wants her for her abilities, she submits to him for her people. Thus the dance between the needs of many vs the desires of a few. Wonderful! Would have been a resounding 5 stars if not for the horrifically abrupt conclusion."
5,Loved it!!!,"I could not put it down. Warprize was such a good book, I went on to read Warsworn, Warlord, Warcry all in the same week. I lost a lot of sleep, but it was worth it. There is depth to the world and the characters created by Ms. Vaughan. The tension between the two societies is entirely believable, and both cultures have their flaws. Plenty of action, interesting plot twists, and believable romance. A great read for both fantasy fans and romance readers. I hope another book is on the way, because I want to know if Kier achieves his ambition, and I want to know how things turn out for Marcus and Liam."
4,easy read,"Nothing too deep here, but interesting and fun. My main reason for writing this review is to complain about the Kindle edition. In the middle of the story several pages were out of place. I was reading and then suddenly the story picked up later on. I kept reading and it jumped back to where I had been in mid-sentence. There were quite a few grammatical mistakes, I don't know it just seemed like they threw this novel together for the Kindle edition. Very disappointed with the publishers, but overall a good story."
5,Didn't want it to end!,"I not one to write reviews but I really, really liked this book! I wasn't sure I even wanted to read it but the reviews got my attention and I couldn't put it down once I stated it. I have the other 2 books in the series on order now. A very good book!"
3,Did not like it at all,"Here's my summary of this book:""Ooo I'm a noble healer and I do what I want! What? My brother the king just gave me away to the enemy? I forgive him because everybody loves me and I love everybody!! What's the plot line you ask? I love the evil warlord who took over my country and I tell him what to do because I'm flawless and amazing!! Ooooo....""Can't say I was a big fan, it was too cliche. I gave three stars because if you're into that sort of thing the writing is pretty decent, editing kinda sucked, but hey, to each his own."
2,Felt flat to me,"I really wanted to like this book, but though the writing was good the story felt flat. I also felt like nothing much happened. While other folks seemed to have enjoyed this book, I was not one of them."
3,Sagging Middle,"Overall an okay read. The story began on a high note, lots of action and tension, but the middle sagged. Nothing exciting happened. Xylara (how do you pronounce that anyway) took charge of the Warlord's healing tent, took on an apprentice, befriended a lot of people, and was constantly hounded by the Warlord's manservant to eat. Yawn.Thankfully the action picked up toward the end of the book and finished in a way that (almost) has me tempted to buy the second book in the series.Also, did anyone else find Ms Vaughan's writing style/characters a lot like Julie Garwood? You know... sticky-sweet heroines that everyone adores. PS: I love Julie Garwood especially The Bride, The Secret, Saving Grace, Honor's Splendor...."
2,Had potential but was lacking depth,"This book has a great premise of a princess who is given to the enemy in exchange for peace in her kingdom. However, as the book progressed it became clear that our heroine lacks depth of character. She is presented as a girl who has a love for healing the sick, is a bit headstrong, and little else. Lara shows no personal growth throughout the book and as a character she remains pretty flat.The plot is predicable with no surprises and shows little creativity. The book is tied up a little too neatly at the end and I was left skeptical of the easy conclusion of things. I was completely unsatisfied buy the dull characterization, laughable metaphors, and the underdeveloped romance.Overall, I did finish the book so it was good enough for me to read the entire thing once I started it, but would I advise anyone else to read it? No."
1,Boring,I guess I'm the only one - but I found this boring and predictable. Didn't get more than halfway through. Recommend the libary.
4,Wonderful Story!!,"This is a great book, particularly considering it's the author's first. Interesting twists and turns, great characters, and a marvelous ending. A little less spicey than I normally prefer, but hopefully the author will remedy that in the next two books. A definite must-buy."
2,Disappointed,"With all the 4 & 5 star reviews I was sure this would be a great escapist read. It wasn't. Most of the book focused on Xylara's skills as a master healer; if you don't think endless scenes describing cleaning wounds, dispensing medicines and emptying slop jars interesting then this'll be a snooze. The romantic parts were sorely lacking as well. In the one and only intimate scene, the warlord, Keir, offers to have another guy ""initiate"" Lara because he says he's not a teacher! This is not what I want to read about a barbarian warlord love interest. Lastly, I had problems with the ""who's trying to kill Lara"" so called mystery. It was clear as day. And the reasons behind it were ridiculous. I won't be reading the rest of the series."
4,Worth seeing for Gabin's performance and Bardot's sexiness,"Well acted, especially by Jean Gabin, and there's no denying Bridget Bardot's sex appeal, although a more gifted actress might have made both the character and the whole film deeper.A middle aged attorney (Gabin) falls for a sexy young client (Bardot) after she bungles a stick up. They carry on an open affair with her, as Gabin's wife keeps waiting for him to come home, and as Bardot keeps vacillating between her older, stable lover, and her hot, volatile young boyfriend.Never boring, but stays pretty much on the surface most of the time, with an oddly light tone. However, the ending twist is quite moving, and gives the whole film a deeper resonance than it would have otherwise."
1,yuck!,"It was all I could do to get a cup of this down. The taste was terrible, sort of sweet but not in a good way. I wouldn't recommend it and in fact I am returning the box I bought. In my opinion, Pixie Mate Green Tea is a good alternative."
3,Out to lunch publishers & editor?,"HORRENDOUSLY UNINTELLIGIBLE FONT used throughout this book, as the previous reviewer mentioned. The FONT is extremely irritating to the eyes after reading just a few pages! WHAT were these publishers thinking? The book is read for INFORMATION and thus, that information should be accessible. As is, this is some editor's, or publisher's, wacky and misguided idea of a quaint, authentic, hand-written ""look."" The font reminds me of those awful, freebie, handwriting fonts you find on the web. A huge mistake. The information is interesting if you can get past the irritation of reading it. Worth more than this monstrosity of a presentation."
4,G-d bless Dr. Lister!,"Terrible font, thus hard to read. Superb introduction to mid-19TH 'Century medicine. If only the medicos had washed their hands nad insturments between operations...!"
4,Not that bad,I am going to go against all of the reviews I read here on Amazon and on other sites and say I don't think the type is all that bad. Don't let that keep you from reading this book or you will miss some interesting reading.
5,Must Have for Kitchens and Bookshelves,"This is one book that every household should have, especially if you just moved out and Mom's no longer doing the cooking for you. I found this book in a single friend's stack of books and started browsing through it and can't put it down. As the title suggests, there is a remedy for most of your cooking mistake. And if there's none, then the book itself is still a funny read."
2,"""how to repair food"" 1998",Was disappointed in first book because did not tell any thing to do with to salty meat loaf and blan green beans. Left out most foods I eat when it came to what the do with left overs.
3,Looks ok,"looks ok, not cheap looking, but not expensive looking either. we gave it as a wedding gift."
1,Not my taste,I could not write a book myself and I don't want to insult the author. I finished it because I had already put 2 books aside and I thought I might be getting too delicate. But I found none of this interesting. Everyone whines. I was hoping they would all just die off when the volcano exploded. Neither happened.
1,Just not all that,"I tend to like this 'kind' of fiction, but actually outside of the author's commentary on world today, the story is quite a bore. I'm quite surprised at the extremely positive reviews thus far.It seems largely a social commentary, without much character development. Perhaps the lack of character development is intended to parody our lives today in the materialistic world, but it makes a dry read."
2,"Light Bulb idea, Short burn life","Using the fictional company Tomorrow Ltd, flat characters, and a few true marketing theories (including Ernest Dichter's ideas regarding propaganda,) Shakker exploits ""american-style marketing"" as a dark, sinister plot against culture. This is a glass-half-empty look at consumer motivation versus company's goals. After finishing the novel, one realizes the reason we continue to read it is the thought provoking and clever ideas Shakker offers throughout the novel. The book itself is not pulled together as a compelling read. Plot and character development are weak; however, those intrigued by social motivation will find themselves highlighting and dogearing a few pages."
4,Like a cultural artifact of the end of the last century,"I just read this book, because I learned about it in this essay by the author, Alex Shakar, about his brief rise to fame in 2001, just before the release of ""The Savage Girl"":[...]In the essay, Shakar talks about how he was becoming a minor celebrity in the literary world, only for his novel to be released the same week as Sept. 11. Since the novel is about consumerism, irony, cultural tourism, and a lot of somewhat ""negative"" and ""anti-business"" ideas that were floating around in the 1990s, it wasn't super popular in the days following Sept. 11. I recommend reading Shakar's essay linked to above, and this book as well, if you're interested in Gen X culture, the 1990s in America, advertising, stealth marketing, trendspotting, etc."
5,my all time favourite movie,"I saw this movie on television, it was trasmitted at the dead of night, such a pity! The plot, acting, cocteau,s narrative and particularly the atmosphere created by use of Bach adaptation to the Vivaldi violin concerto was just awesome!"
3,Pet Gear Auto Carrier,"This is really great for small toy type dogs for going to the vet. But for Travel or vacation, I prefer the 'car seat type' where the dogs can look out etc."
2,If you can get past the arrogance....,"If you can get past the arrogance, you'll find some good ideas, but he would like to think himself as a demigod, and it gets in the way of his otherwise innovative points."
4,A good read reguardless,"There is a ton of information in this. If you want to be a consultant or think you may need one, read it, cover to cover. Might read tween the lines a bit :-). F&P Tech /consulting services"
4,Make Money Fast,"If I get the spam e-mails about Make Money Fast, and don't do 'em, my friend did, and lost, like, a hundred dollars! why should I buy a book?'Cause it works! 'Kay, I'm no Bill Gates yet, but I am making some serious green!I used this and Mikel Levin's Gorilla PR: Wired, and BOOM! Had to go to HR Block just to do my taxes!So, go for it!"
5,WOW!!!,"To quote Emeril, ""Bam! Bam! Bam!"" This book definitely ""kicks it up"" many notches above any alternative. People don't normally think of a business book as one that you can't stop reading, but this is one of those. It carries you from the first page to the last with sound advice on how to start a million dollar consulting business; invaluable information on structuring price {per diem is dead if your smart); shows you the ladder of success in gaining business; and gives invaluable advice on how a contract should be written. There's much more!! Managing capital, turnng ""down"" days into ""up"" ones, and why you should give up part of your client list each year! What?Want to build a consulting business? Start here! Are you a business looking for consultants? Look for one that practices the principles in this book!""Million Dollar Consulting"" is worth 20 times the investment needed to bring it home."
4,A guide for solo consultants,"A lot of what is said here is plain common sense, but as they say, common sense ain't that common, and so a book like this might help in identifying what you failed to notice or to order your thoughts or to validate what you already practise. Some points are certainly interesting and can add to your thoughts on the topic, value-added pricing being one of them. By practising all of what Mr Weiss says, you will finally be ""Achieving Self-Realization"" (the prestige and money way; not the new-age thing!). Good advice and the book --which is part of Mr Weiss plan to expand and attract attention to his practise-- helps to a certain extent in that it shows you the plan/approach taken by a successful consultant. It clearly says at the beginning that it's intended for solo practise."
5,Million Dollar Consulting,Great book. Thanks for writing it and helping consultants with a common language and guideline to follow.
5,Wish I had read it sooner!,"This book was recommended to me last month by my business coach who was pretty surprised I had not already read it. If you think of your consulting business as a BUSINESS, this book is for you too."
5,Best Business Book I've Ever Read,"If a successful, wealthy business person could somehow articulate all they've learned in a neat little package, this is what Alan Weiss has done. It is the perfect book. It has given me a wealth of knowledge of the consulting field, the knowledge to make it grow, and most importantly Alan has convinced me that it is possible to become a wealthy business owner and still maintain a company of one employee, me.I have just completed the book and wrote notes in most of the margins. I use it now as a reference book, because it now acts like an encyclopedia. This is the second consulting book (about the 20th business/management book) I've read and it is by far the best one. Real practical knowledge. Buy it, Keep it, Use it!!"
2,For the CEOs best friend,"I was impressed by the few first pages in the book. But as you read along there is very little added.In my humble opinion the book becomes quite self centric to mister Weiss. If you have access to a lot of top level CEOs and you need somebody to tell you you should charge them fat fees which would exceed ""normal"" hourly rates, then this book is for you, but then again why would you be after a book like this in that situation.Sure there are good lines here and there, but overall for me it was not too much fun reading. It is quite US centric and many parts are on the edge of being childish, see chapters on technology for example.This is the last Weiss book I'll buy."
5,Try it - you might just like it,"True, this is a different Merle we're hearing than the one most country fans are used to. And if you're a first time buyer of Merle's music, this one might not convince you that he is truly the legend he is. But real HAG FANS, and music fans willing to take a bit of a risk, will appreciate this side of Merle. His voice was not what it could have been at the time he recorded this, and we've later found that this was due to his dental problems that have now been repaired. But it's still Merle....the man with the golden pen who has an uncanny ability to capture emotions on a sheet of paper. I think anyone who REALLY listens to this album with an open mind and keen ear will agree that it's a beautiful collection."
2,"An artistic achievement, but not for Billy-Bob.","After escaping the confinement of large record labels in Nashville, the Hag has given us an effort straight from his heart. The songs show raw emotion and they range in style from blues to country swing to traditional ballads.Although the album is well cut and the effort pure, there is not much here for the fan of Mama Cried or I'm a Lonesome Fugitive. If that's what you are looking for, best to go back and find a compilation of oldies."
5,"A little different, but still classic Haggard","I own nearly every Haggard CD there is, I've heard just about everything, I've even seen him in concert, and the new cd stays true to the country music I listened to as a child. This cd has an older country feel, before it was flooded by pop singers, yet it is a little different than the Hag I'm used to. I think it's great and a must for any Hag fan."
5,Pure and simple,"What a great album! Anyone looking for ""real"" country music, look no further than this latest disc by this country legend."
4,Cute toy...once you can get it to work...,"First of all you need a mini USB cable to be able to download your child's name. Thankfully we had one already that came with our video camera. We hooked it up to the desktop computer and for some reason it kept saying our sons' names (Kaiden & Brady) were invalid even though their names were available to download. So, my husband (a computer engineer) had to hook it up to his laptop and it downloaded just fine. Not sure what the problem was, but now that it works, it's a really fun toy! My son just loves that Diego talks to him."
4,My son loves this toy. Doesn't include USB cable though.,"My son recieved this for his 2nd birthday from his friends. You go to the Fisher Price site to download the program so the toy will say your child's name. It works great and he really likes to play with it. Unfortunately, the USB cable needed for this toy is not included and it cost 23.00 dollars from Radio Shack. But as I stated earlier, it was a GREAT gift and my son gets a kick out of hearing his name and really love Go Diego Go."
5,a classic,a very cool book. i even bought copies for my relatives. skip to the brown pages. this book probably affected the course of my life. i got his latest book 'still here' and i was dissapointed. it almost seemed like he sold out. if you like this check out books and audio lectures by Alan Watts.
3,Too Late to Stimulate,"I should have gotten the book when I was in my twenties (over 30 yrs. ago!). But then again, even in my Hippie-dippy days, I didn't particularly care for the countless fonts, script sizes and reading in circles. If you are seeking solid substance and inspiration, read ""The Discourses"" by Meher Baba. If you took out the repetition and redundancies in ""Be Here Now"", the book would be about 30 pages."
3,"Digs deep into the heart, right where the questions are.","Insecurity is a part of many of us. Loneliness, uneasiness, and constant questions about our significance, bring inner turmoil that continuously acts as an acid on our inner Self. Comfort comes to us when we feel that someone can understand these constraints. Be Here Now by Ram Baba Dass gave me hope in a time when hopelessness clung to me. The ideas presented in this art-filled bubble of joyful laughter told me that there was more to life than the terrors I had already seen."
5,The craziest guidebook to life and spirit ever.,"My spiritual father, who was then my father-in-law, introduced me to Be Here Now. I thought he was crazy and the book even crazier.The next time we visited I picked up the book and took a closer look, ahhh, maybe it wasn't so crazy after all, but not for me. Each time I visited I was drawn to read a bit more of this ""far out"" book. Over a year later I finished reading it. And then I read it all over again. How wise my father-in-law had been to set me on this path. I am eternally grateful to him and to Ram Dass for their love and guidance. Ram Dass' words ring true. Any one looking for answers would do well to start with Be Here Now"
3,Be here now,"When I first read the book nearly 30 years ago; it significantly changed my meditation and choices of time spent. Now, been there done that."
1,New Age Garbage,"Ram Das is not for the serious practitioner.A lot of the writings in this book are based upon LSD experiences with Timothy Leary as well as drug advocacy for spiritual reasons. While Ram Das is a very smart person and a good human being as far as humanitarianism goes, there are a bunch of other books to read that have more quality for the spiritual seeker than this one. This is spiritual materialism at it's best."
1,Sprituality of a wrong kind,"This is an example that not every book that talks about Love, God and spirituality is helpful for one's spiritual development. The author read some spiritual books, ideas got all mixed up in his head he added some of his imagination and then put them all on paper. This book if read without critical mind will create more illusions take one away from right path and will be harmful. If read with a critical mind this book of a very little use because of all the garbage one have to sort through to find anything useful."
1,Be here now,"Unlike the great title and the great cover page, this book was not good. It was about drugs and stupid stuff and although I read many books like this one and enjy them, this one I didn't like much. Maybe it had to do with too much talk of drugs and the sixties attitude."
1,even HE has dispensed with this hallucination.,"He thinks all methods are traps now. bhagwan das, who is portrayed as enlightened in the book, is presently hawking a book here at amazon showing his life of the last 30 years and it's wreckage and confusion. What the heck, if it sells, the author makes some money, but isnce he is bedridden, does he need it?"
4,"It's ""out there""","I had a copy of this in the 70s, this is the same book. This later reproduction is not quite the quality of the original-paper and printing seem to be inferior. ""Be here now"", of course, is about living in the present, but the book delves into Eastern Spirtuality, states of mind, even drug use. To me, it is kind of a link to the 60s and early 70s, which is largely why I bought it. Some people will take it more seriously than others. One thing I ca positively say though, is that there will be no other book on your bookshelf like it."
5,Ram Dass is very helpful,"Nice book. Plenty of universal truths that tend to slip through our everyday experience. Dass has been kind enough to pick them up, collect them and show them to us."
5,A Must Read,"I was so happy to find this book online as it is very difficult to find in a bookstore. Re-reading it, I found Be Here Now just as inspiring as the first time I came across this piece of spiritual literature. A life-changing read!"
5,mhhhhm,"Gave this book away as a gift, so i never really got to far into it. What i did read however was excellent. I love books with a message and this book had a message pure and clear as day."
5,Fantastic Book,"This text is soaring and poetic at parts, and practical and informative at others. I find the last section to be the most valuable and it could stand alone as a book. ""Be Here Now"" is an indispensable classic of modern spiritual literature, and should be read by any serious seekers on the path."
4,Very Pleased,The product arrived on time and in the condition as described. I am pleased with the service I received.
4,"fast shipping, great book, good contition","quick delivery, condition as advertised, great book, great price. great transaction, would recommend this seller to anyone."
4,Inspiring,"After weeks of of clouded thoughts leading me back to where I started, a friend recommended I read this book. I went on a search for it and it ended up finding me. I bought it on a Monday, read it all day on tuesday, by Wednesday I had done three drawings, one collage, and one oil painting. Now mind that i hadn't had any creativity flowing through me for a year! This book was obviously written while on acid but it is amazing what words and ideas came out of this man. I would recommend, and have recommended it. Especialy if you are searching for something yrt you have no idea what it is."
5,THE MOST AMAZING BOOK,"AS A 16 YEAR OLD IN CANADA AND GROWING UP IN A VERY RELIGIOUS HOME, THIS WAS THE BOOK THAT HAS OPENED MY EYES. "" THERE IS THE ANSWER.... AND IT WAS INSIDE ME ALL ALONG!!"". I'M READING IT FOR THE 5TH THIME, BECAUSE ONCE, TWICE, FIFTY TIMES IS NEVER ENOUGH!! THIS BOOK JUST OPENS, OPENS, OPENS AGAIN YOUR SOUL, MIND AND BODY..... VERY CAPTIVATING, VERY TRUSTING..... VERY LOVELY. WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS MY LOVE FOR THIS BOOK.... AND FOR A TEENAGER (we get confused, we get upset, we need advice, and we need to know!) THIS BOOK IS THE ONE TO READ....THIS BOOK IS AMAZING."
5,Be Here Now led me to SEVA!,"I LOVE BE HERE NOW & RAM DASS! I'm so grateful to him for writing this wonderful book and for founding the organization SEVA! They do such incredible work! SEVA has restored eyesight to nearly 3 million blind people around the world!!!!Check them out at [...]I particularly love their GIFTS OF SERVICE!!!

3,For use with a teacher,"I have been exploring Classical Chinese for a few months now. I am not following a formal course of study. I have studied Mandarin and Japanese in the past.The book has interesting material on the history of the Chinese language. The introduction to grammar is also useful, and the function word list in the appendix is very handy.On the whole, however, the explanations given, even for the introductory texts, are too concise for someone working on his own. I am finding ""Classical Chinese: A Basic Reader in Three Volumes"" by Yuan et al. much better suited to my needs, because the text analysis is much more thorough and the vocabulary list richer. By the way, Yuan's reader also has a complementary volume on poetry, while Fuller focuses on prose only."
1,Just another racist,"I see where there have been books! written analyzing and questioning Christopher Dardens loyalty to his ""people"". Wellnever fear, if you read his book you will learn that Christopher A. Darden is a racist. He should of never served on this trial.Both him, Marcia Clark and judge Ito should have never been assigned to this trial. The whole thang was pay back for Rodney King anyway. Hey, it never ends.Be sure and get the book thru your library tho. You don't want to support a racist."
2,Some good information but self serving to a fault.,"The first 100 pages or so were packed with insight into Mr. Dardens early years and the start of this case. Later in the book he becomes too self serving as to his role in the Prosecuting Teams screw up of what should have been a ""Cake Walk"" trial"
3,Just as I suspected...,This book confirms that Christopher Darden is an idiot! All is not lost however the pages of this best-seller server to line the floor of my bird's cage
1,Never received!!,"Not only have I not received this order, but I have not heard from the seller about it."
5,Great Perspective,Mr. Zahn evidently knows what he is talking about. I've used his techniques while in business and have found them very effective. I highly recommend this book.
4,The history of a place,"To get the true feeling of a place, I think you have to know the background and what to look for. Visiting Glendalough in Ireland, you'll instantly see that the area is gorgeous, but knowing the rich history of the place and what to look for will enhance the meaning. This book will take you through the monastic city of Glendalough step by step, and explain the rich history of the place."
3,Tour Guide,"Glendalough--A Celtic Pilgrimage, is part tour guide and part Celtic Spirituality with a little bit of history that will take you through the area of this 6-12th Century Monastic community. The book is not the easiest read for in order to fully understand what the authors are discussing, you will need a basic knowledge of what the place was like and a general idea of the ruins and lay of the landscape in order to fully appreciate the text.The book is best used on site as the authors do not provide much in the way of illustrations leaving those who have never been there without any real idea of what a particular structure may look like. The book focuses mainly on structural features of the ruins with some added side notes on St. Kevin and the community he founded. I recommend this book if you have prerequisites knowledge of the area or are planning a visit to the grounds.Readers of this review are invited to comment either below or my email listed in my profile."
4,Slightly dated....but still a nice quick read on OT theology,"You can read more about Edward (E. J.) Young elsewhere. This is a very short read that has long been out of print....but you can still pick it up used for a fairly cheap price. It's written at an introductory/college type level, so most anyone should find the reading style clear. It's a good summary of a generally academic-yet-conservative Reformed view of the Old Testament circa 1950. Lots has happened since then that needs updating, but Young surveys the 1850-1940 period fairly well, even if only in a very cursory fashion."
1,Terrible design including safety hazard,"Bought this Zyliss nutmeg grater after reading the rave what a great product this is. These are the reason why this is not a good product:1. As soon as you insert the whole nutmeg, one finds out the the tension of the steel spring is just too much and it will not let you move the nutmeg nut over the grater part. If you use move strength to make it move over the grater, the nutmeg will shatter and still will not move.2. The handle which you are supposed to hold on to while grating has a very sharp metal edge and will cause injury.This is an unusual ""bad"" product of Zyliss. Recommend not to buy."
2,Dissapointing,"These brownies are quite small and super rich. They are the least brownie like brownies I've ever had. They are more like super moist fudge squares. I like brownies to be more dry, more cake-like and flaky. These have strayed too far from what a brownie actually is."
5,Coggins succeeds again with Vulture Capital,"Witty and fast-paced, Vulture Capital is one fun read. Fans of The Immortal Game will be thrilled with the return of private eye August Riordan, and also the reappearance of his likeable sidekick Chris Duckworth. Newcomers and old fans alike will appreciate Coggins' vivid, stylish prose, well-developed plot line, complex characters, sparkling (and also very funny) dialogue, and the novel's San Francisco Bay Area locations depicted in the author's own photographs that introduce each chapter. I say ""Hammet is a Coggins for the twentieth century."""
2,"Sorry August, but.....","When I read the first book about August Riordan, I thought I found my new hero. A tough guy, PI set in the modern world and a really good story. I could hardly put down the first book. Then I bought Vulture Capital. What a bore! I was more than half-way through the book before we ever saw Riordan. The book didn't even make him the main character. He was doing investigation stuff that we didn't even see or hear about until he was telling the client. I just found it hard to read. If I wanted to read about a venture capitalist, I would have bought one about a venture capitalist. I wanted a book about a private eye. I just hope the ones that follow are better."
4,Great book for those who see the underlying nature of personal agreements - I even bought it after I read it from the Library,"I liked this book. Sure of itself but not too dogmatic.Really insightful info about how we action with respect to the past, present and how to move into the present moment in a thoughtful way. Agreements with yourself are in motion and making some life-changing progress can be sometimes quick and beneficial.A blessing"
4,Beautiful contemplative music,"You don't really need to speak Chinese to understand this as it's not exactly a guide to Qu-igong, but peaceful music designed to accompany a beautiful peaceful activity. I can speak some Chinese but I don't practice Qi-qongAs Liu Sola lives in America, perhaps a Western analogy is correct-- this Chinese good ambient music (without sinking to new age rubbish), for want of a better term"
4,Great book for historians and military buffs,"The book outlines the experiences of a soldier from boot camp to South Pacific in WWII. It is not necessarily a day to day account, but does a great job in retelling the soldier's experiences in his preparation for war. I recommend it!"
3,Product does not match picture.,"As I suspected, the product was actually listed as 36tpi but the picture showed 24tpi. Product sent was pictures but did not match description."
1,"This thing doesn't blow it whispers. I have 2 shih=tsu with gorgeous coats , i will try to sell it or retun it . Not worth $30.","Cheap and a waste of money. Maybe if you have a very small, bald dog it may work. This is not made for any dog."
2,If you like sandalwood....,"....you'll be disappointed.I purchased the shampoo and conditioner anticipating the wonderful scent of sandalwood I was about to whiff, expecting my hair to smell heavenly all day. Didn't happen. In fact, the scent is SO unlike sandalwood, it rather reminded me of your basic drugstore brand, generic, no-name shampoo. I thought something miraculous might happen when activated by water, so I went ahead and used it...it lathered up nicely, and my hair was manageable and soft, but I have hundreds of products in my bathroom that will do that-and they didn't cost a fortune. Not recommended."
5,Great!,"We signed up for a toddler music class and they played a couple of songs from this. When the class was over, I ran out and got the CD. It is great!"
4,Its good...,"Its a great quality action figure,but it only has two weapons with it. It looks great, the design for it. I would recommend you buy more than on action figure with this one. This action figure is no fun by itself. Another reason to collect all three is to assemble Metal Gear Ray. Its a great action figure. Buy it!"
5,stained,my solid snake was stained...actually both were stained in the box with what seems like figure paint.... what the (...)!!!
5,Interesting,"It's quite sad, interesting, and part non-fiction information. It makes me want to read it all over again. But Isabel will soon regret her first words about the ocean. She will surely miss the ocean and her whale family much."
3,Non plussed,"again, little tikes seem to be disappointing me this year. when we got it, and i was wrapping it, the batteries didn't work, so i had to completely take it out and put in new batteries so my son could play with it when he got it... and as all parents know, that is such a chore... whoever invented the twist ties should be shot! i thought it would have a little better sound... but alas i am disappointed."
2,My son has little interest for this toy,My son is 10 months old and has little to no interest for this toy. The sound is very dull. There is little to no learning quality to it. I would certainly spend my money on the Vtech ball next time. A friend has it and my son loves that.
5,great bag,"this bag is great. it was exactly what i was looking for. being able to easily fit a 22' cymbal is nice. the back straps are awesome and make it very easy to transport your cymbals - much more comfortable than a shoulder strap. the cymbal dividers are pretty good too - sure, you could go with a protection racquet's bag with the fleece, but that is much more expensive. i'd say that this bag is the best i have seen for the cost."
1,Don't buy if you actually play out.,"I bought this cymbal bag because it was big, inexpensive, and had shoulder straps. Within a month, it had shown it's worth. The shoulder straps were the first thing to go (both of them), followed closely by the hi hat section up front ripping slowly. I had it taped, hoping it would last me another few weeks while I saved up for a better one, until just now, when my hats fell through the bottom. I immediately came up here to write this review and order a new bag.Seriously, don't buy this piece of junk."
3,Straps Need Improvement,"The bag itself is great for the cymbals. However, the shoulder straps started failing at the top seam a few months after I received it. Poor quality strapping material and sewing in my opinion. I'm looking to have the straps reattached and reinforced at the top seam."
1,Used 6 times and started to fall apart,I used this product a total of 6 times. 4 practices and 2 gigs and the stitching started to come out at the top of the bag. Not a well made bag at all. If you want something to last this is not it! I am sending it back and losing 6 dollars in shipping costs! What a disappointment!
4,Great bag,"I recently purchased this great, practical bag. It has nice space in the main section and the outer pocket is ideal for carrying extras like wing-nuts and and extra felt disks for cymbals. Also, what is very practical, is the back-pack type straps which frees up your hands to carry other pieces of equipment. It is worth the price."
4,Pro Bag,A decent pro bag for a great price. The only reason I replaced my original was the top handle began to tear from the bag after 7 years of constant use. Really like the protective bottom which many higher priced cymbal bags don't have. Great value for the price.
2,not as pictured,"This product is not as pictured, none of the hardware shown is included. I thought it was unusual that the hardware would be included, but it was in the picture...... would have been helpful if the description stated that."
2,"Not much in-depth information, bit superficial.","I expected much more information on how Winona Ryder really is, her hobbies, likes and dislikes etc. If I am correct, the author of this book didn't even have contact with ms. Ryder herself. Still, it gives a summary of her movies, which is nice."
2,This is a greatly Revised edition of the orginal work.,"Having read the orginal version of Helldorado 20 years ago, anticipation of again reading this first hand account of Tombstone days quickly lead to disappoint due to the blatant revisions in this book. For example, the chapter about John Ringo has been completely omitted and substitutions based on author Jack Burrows's derogatory comments from the Gunfighter Who Never Was have been substituted. Orignal photographs have also been omitted. Since William Breakenridge was actually acquainted with the people and times he wrote about, why should a modern revisionist feel compelled to correct his original observations and opinions and thus distort history? If an author has a different viewpoint, then let him/her write their own version, not use the title of another's work."
4,Helldorado Review,"A very interesting book providing a first hand account of life in the Old West. Breakenridge hurts his credibility with his highly biased account of the Sand Creek massacre and with his too cozy relationship with the outlaws in the vicinity of Tombstone but his narrative is nonetheless, fascinating. His anecdotes about life in the West provide a perspective not typically found in contemporary books. Fortunately, the editor included lots of footnotes to explain Breakenridge's factual errors to help the reader figure out what is real and what is not."
2,Breakenridge - A View From Within The Clanton Gang,"Please read this book with the understanding the nature of W.M. Breakenridge's relationship to the ""cowboys"" and Clanton faction. He, along with John Behan were openly aligned with the rustlers and criminal element. Consequently, his comments regarding Mr. Earp and the law in Tombstone are terribly biased and not to be taken as fact. Had Mr. Breakenridge been neutral, his words would have had significance. Mr. Breakenridge was little more than a tax collector, although he paints himself as a force in law. Reading his manuscript as fact would be similar to reading a biography of Adolph Hitler written by Joseph Goebbels and accepting it as pure fact."
3,I guess I'm not the target audience,"I'm disappointed with this book, but maybe my expectations were too high. Revelation 2-3 is one of my favorite sections of Scripture. Plus, the author's father, Leonard Ravenhill, always hit me where I needed it, and hit me hard. This book, unfortunately, isn't really hitting me much at all.The problem for me is that the author frequently seems to assume that the reader has been caught up into some of the dumber aspects of modern Christianity, such as the Prosperity Gospel and Jezebel spirits, and spends a lot of time refuting things that I never bought into, so reading these sections is a waste of time for me. I suppose if you're caught up in these things, this book will either convict you or make you angry, so it might be worth a read. But I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book now, and so far I haven't seen a whole lot here that would seriously challenge someone whose beliefs come strictly from the Bible instead of some loony televangelist."
5,Highly recommended,"my father in law is a very large man, and it it difficult to find shoes that fit him correctley and comfortabley. These were great. i got them for a christmas gift and he actually ended up buying another pair once they were worn out."
3,Second Rate Melville,"I'm a big fan of Melville's work but this is not his best. It's dragged down by too many wasted frames where nothing happens cinematographically or thematically and by the poor acting of his leading lady, Christine Fabréga. Le Circle Rouge and Le Samourai are much better."
2,Good Story - Bad Packaging,"The story itself is good. However, this book, produced by Kessinger Publishing, is of very poor quality. The Description reads that the book is 48 pages. However, there is only writing on 27 of those pages. The rest (with the exclusion of a publisher's mark on the last page) are blank - not even a header of ""Notes"". The book appears to be a poor scan or download from the internet. Many apostrophies are missing - there's just a blank space where they should be. In one place, the goddess ""Juno"" suddenly becomes some named ""Julio"" - easily an error in an OCR program mistaking an ""n"" as an ""li"". All in all, if you are going to buy this book understand that it is little more than a poorly crafted pamphlet."
5,Fantastic summary / reference for Laser cutting shops,"Dr. Caristan has done a fantastic job of providing a comprehensive review of laser cutting of metals for manufacturing. From laser operators to shop managers, this is a must have!"
2,One Whole Day - Wolves,"As an elementary school teacher (2nd grade) who teaches a large unit on wolves and wolf behavior and who has quite an extensive library of children's books about wolves, I was disappointed in Jim Arnosky's book. I also anticipated a higher quality publication from National Geographic. Much of the author's research came from visiting a captive wolf facility in northwestern New Jersey. I would have much rather seen his research coming out of Yellowstone, Idaho, or Montana. Young children can be pretty sophisticated when it comes to learning about wildlife. I think the author could have gone into more detail in his descriptions and could have added much more information re: such things as wolf communication, pack structure, and the predator-prey relationship. Children enjoy learning about such things and there are many better books in print that give children a much better picture of the gray wolf in North America. I was also not impressed by the book's illustrations."
1,Raptured,This movie was not what I expected from a movie in the Christian section. It went from the DVD player to the trash. I would not want anyone to make the same mistake I make when I bought it. There is no rating for this piece of trash.
2,mediocre & over priced,"A lot dimmer than any advertising photos would imply. Additionally, the various cover/shells are pretty mediocre as well...Any positive reviews at sites like engadget are questionable at best (yes, if someone gave me this stuff for free I'd probably give it a better review as well -- especially knowing that good reviews lead companies to send me even more free stuff to review;-)In a lit room, very little is visible on the walls/ceilings -- there are about 10-15 small points of light that have a rather dull pattern of movement -- the interesting patterns are made up of tiny refractions but these points of light are very dim & are not visible in a lit room.I'd suggest waiting a while -- I'm sure someone else will come out with a far superior product as LEDs&lasers; are becoming brighter & cheaper."
3,"Expect a lava lamp, not a planetarium","If you expect a lava lamp type of lamp made with a laserpointer beam and some LEDs, you'll be happy. If you've seen youtube videos and expect a planetarium-like display or something akin to a disco mirrorball effect all over the ceiling, you'll be majorly miffed. Those videos are artfully filmed and highly misleading. This light is very soft and pretty to lie in bed in a pitch-dark room and gaze at. The mechanism is quiet so you could fall asleep to it. I suggest you put a cheap timer on the outlet though as instructions say to not run for longer than 4 hours."
2,"Fairly Disappointed, Effects fairly simple","I just received this product in the mail today. I was fairly disappointed, especially after my friend hyped it up. It's basically either1) red dots on a blue background, or2) red wavy thingsThe diffusers basically just shut off the light, so I don't know what use they are. Also, you're only supposed to have it on for 4 hours.Might be a good $10 toy, but not worth the $100 + shipping I paid for it."
3,Quilt in a Day ...,"this is an ""okay"" book but wish I hadn't purchased it. Next time I'll be more selective on my quilt books."
1,What happened?,"With a very artistic cast, I was expecting this movie to be great. After watching Center Stage........I feel horribly disgusted with this film. It has no plot, no appropriate character development, and overall SUCKED. Nobody should watch this."
4,Know what to expect,"I enjoyed this movie but it wasn't what I was expecting. The description on the DVD leads you to believe that there is a story of a man and woman and ballet happens to be the backdrop. On the contrary, this is a story about a ballet company. There are many characters in and out of the scene and Ry (Neve Campbell's character) just happens to be one of them. So, watch without expecting Ry's story to kick off and you'll enjoy an interesting glimpse into the world of dance.I knew next to nothing but now I know that I'll appreciate ballet all the more next time, thanks to The Company!"
2,the company,i would not share that with no one at all. i would not watch again and not even share it with know body.
3,Great ballet scenes,"The storyline is a bit hard to follow and not written well. But, the dance scenes are worth watching if you love ballet. Neve Campbell did really well for not being a pro."
5,Much better than I expected,"I enjoyed this movie more than I had expected to given the reviews I've read. I think one has to love dance more than the average movie-goer does in order to enjoy The Company.The dancing is wonderful. It is modern in the way it is choreographed and balletic in the way it is danced. And both the choreography and dancing are the very best. As a former member of the Los Angles Ballet Company I can say there is a lot of realism in the depiction of the life of the dancers.I agree that there is not much plot in The Company; but really, aren't we all tired of the overdone young-dancer-gets-a-break-and-becomes-a-star storyline? The Company doesn't need plot because it is not a story; it is a portrait of a way of life. Looked at like that, it is a wonderful movie."
3,OK to watch once,"Good dancing; not much of a plot. Shows what it might be like to be in a ballet company: Career-limiting injuries; lots of silly prancing about. Arbitrary, despotic artistic directors. Moments of beauty. Great bodies; super-skilled."
1,Boring boring boring,"I wanted to see this movie after watching Center Stage and loving it. Boy was I sorry. If dancing is all you want to see, maybe you won't mind it. But this really wasn't a 'movie' about dancers. It's made more like a poor documentary, where the camera seems to just be in the background while performers practice and talk to each other about other stuff. It makes you feel very detached from the characters, and despite liking ballet, I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of it. So, I don't know how it ends, but I know it was boring me to tears for the first 20 minutes. Watch Center Stage instead. Better plot, music, and you'll care about the characters' plights."
2,The Company,"Why did I listen to all of you who said this was such a great movie? The dancing, I do have to say, was wonderful. But the rest of this movie was horrible. Long, horrible and incredibly boring. The story has little continuity and the ending, just ends. ""That's it, we're done"". If you love ballet and especially a ""Cirque du Soleil"" style, then this movie is for you. If you want to watch classical ballet and have a story to follow, watch something else."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to see Neve Campbell on film again. As I was watching The Company I kept thinking, 'When is this story gonna pick up?' The dance sequences are beautiful but there is absolutely no story. I bet Neve has 10 lines in the whole movie and she is clearly the main star. The look of this film is like a documentary...not a drama. If you are a ballet fan then you will adore this film. I found myself fast forwarding the dances to get to the story. Lets just say I did a lot of fast forwarding."
2,Interesting yet boring no plot,"It had no plot and never showed the reason why the company was put together. Not like the others I have seen like this, very disappointed!I expected more from the previews I anticipated a whole lot more."
2,The Company,"Ok, if you want to watch several good Joffrey Ballet pieces, it might be worth the money.....however, this is just a movie trying to cover the ballet world. It's a really bad, unrealistic look at the ballet world through Neve Campbell's eyes. The whole movie is just bad (except for the Joffrey dancing) no plot, no acting skills by any of the ""real"" actors, bad acting on the part of the ballet dancers ... but then they are dancers and not proclaiming to be actors. There's just no plot and it's hard to make sense of what is trying to be portrayed in this film. The only saving grace is watching the ballet pieces that don't involve Neve Campbell as the ""star"".This is truly a tragic way to portray life in a ballet company.......a plot or something would have definitely have helped Neve make this movie into something.."
1,I Hate This Movie,"I hated this movie! It didn't even have a plot, and it was very boring. If your looking for a ballet movie I would recomend Center Stage."
5,Essential viewing for the balletomane,Essential viewing for the balletomane! Naturalistic - almost a documentary - with wonderful dancing and beautifully understated acting. Love it.
2,"BEAUTIFUL DANCING, PLOT LACKING","I really couldn't come to care for any of the characters in this movie. The ballet is beautiful, especially the group performances. However, the actors failed to draw me in. This movie is just okay, nothing special. If you missed it, that's okay. Just rent it and fast forward to all the group performances and u won't be missing much. BOTTOM LINE: WORTH IT FOR THE DANCING, BUT YOU'LL STILL FIGHT TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. GRADE:C-"
2,TUTU'S COMPANY,"Well, it had to happen eventually. A Robert Altman film I truly dislike. I get the impression this ballet company film was way scaled down from a bloated romantic script and consequently we're left with the bare bones of cliched situations and characters, who instead of executing their expectant behavior, manage to do nothing at all. I'm glad that the kid ballet guy with no place to sleep didn't end up hanging from a rope, and that the young star's choice of a common Romeo type over a dashing prancer didn't cause her starry-eyed Mother to rebel, but why ignite these flames at all just to see them die down to a warm but lifeless ember? The love story aspect was particularly insulting, just short of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw catching snowflakes with their tongues. Be it a ballet company stage or a common office, this film only proves that most of us have a pretty dull day."
2,So-so Company,"Though I`m not Robert Altman`s biggest fan, I still expected ""The Company"" to be a bit better. This look into ballet has some well-crafted scenes and an adequate documentary-style direction, yet the story goes nowhere and the characters(?) are underdeveloped to say the least. Yes, the movie contains a couple of interesting and aptly-coreographed dance moments which offer some eye-candy, but that just isn`t enough to carry a film. ""The Company"" is average and doesn`t have much to say, leaving the viewer somehow disappointed and waiting for more. The concept was promising, yet the resolution is, unfortunately, a boring, lifeless and cold letdown.There are better companies around."
3,WASN'T WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE WITH A PLOT, THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE ALL DANCING, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS SOME GREAT BALLET THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. I GIVE ALL THE DANCING A FOUR, BUT OVERALL THE MOVIE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF LET DOWN. IT GOES BEHIND THE SCENES OF WHAT A COMPANY IS LIKE AND THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, BUT I WASN'T. I GUESS IF IT HAD BEEN MORE CLEAR, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS DISAPPOINTED. I WAS HOPING FOR A PLOT LINE AND IF THERE WAS ONE THAN I MAY HAVE MISSED IT. NOT ONE OF ROBERT ALTMAN'S GREATEST. WATCH IT TO GET YOUR OWN OPINION. GREAT DANCE SCENES AND THAT'S ALL THERE REALLY IS TO IT."
5,A wonderful behind the scenes look at artistic production,"First of all, let me make one thing perfectly clear. I am not a big fan of dance in general and ballet particularly. Next, there is essentially no story in this movie--it's more of a documentary style look at how dance productions are put together. With all that, I loved this movie. I was totally swept up with the dance numbers which are extremely creative and haunting and fun to watch. In addition, Malcolm MacDowell is wonderful as that crusty genius who runs the show. He is absolutely convincing. I was fascinated watching the performances rehearsed and how they went from choosing the dancers to the final spectacle on the stage. If you appreciate art at all and are fascinated at what it takes to expose yourself as an artist on the stage, I highly, highly recommend this film. Robert Altman continues to amaze. Bravo!"
3,Read before renting/buying,"This movie has a vey small plot. It should definatley be rated PG13, read the rating before renting/buying becasue of nudity and language. It has great, amazing dancing that is very unique and a must see for any ballerina over the age of 14."
4,GOOD IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT,"When I first saw this, I didn't like it. I watched & actually finished it the second time & was able to enjoy it. It's not your typical movie. More like it's not sure whether it wants to be a movie or a documentary."
4,classic Altman,"Seen Nashville? The Company is like that, with ballet substituted for country music. It's ponderous. It picks up at no particular point and ends without any conclusion. Those aren't complaints - it's a beautiful movie, the ballet is gorgeous. But it's slow, and there's no plot to speak of, and it asks more questions than it answers. I'd watch it again."
1,intellectually uncreative,"All right, there's no story, no plot. Not even really any characters. Fine. I can accept intellectually creative attempts of high art. But I guess this film is just too 'high' for me.OK, I understand that everyone out there isn't some HUGE dance fan and won't potentially comprehend everything about the film. I rented this film because, as I do respect dance as well as Altman's creative visions in past films, that it would at least open up my eyes to the world of dance in some way. I guess this film was only meant to be accessible by those couple dozen die-hard dance followers, not the rest of the public at large. Even the dance sequences got to be pretty boring after a while."
3,Dissapointing.,"The dance choreography in this movie was the one thing that kept me from turning off this flick halfway through.The dancing is gorgeous. However, Altman creates characters that are flat and uninteresting and there is almost no plot. And when I say no plot, you better believe it. The characters' problems are barely there, and the ending is unsatisfying.I wonder why, if the plot is so unimportant to Altman, that he didn't choose to include more dance numbers or show more rehearsal footage?Overall, not an incredibly horrible movie, but for all the hype I was v. dissapointed."
1,Don't bother,"After seeing all the bad reviews I figured to give it a try....it is Altman the master after all. Well, the reviewers were right...this is bad, bad, bad. And even if you are a fan of dancing it is still bad. It makes dance look silly and it makes dance directors look even more silly. I think what this really was was Altman lending his time and name to help someone else do their project. He did this for money and nothing more. This is not really an Altman film at all. The biggest give away is the audio track. There mixture of multiple interchanges is just not there. Altman should have instead done a film about the fashion industry which was something he knew and loved much more than dance. If you love dance, do not watch this film. For me, All That Jazz has some of the best filmed dance of all time. Of course it was made by one greatest choreographers to ever work on Broadway."
4,"My voice never sounded so clear, but......","I love the clarity that this condenser mic brings to my voice --- the high frequencies are far more crisp than with even my best dynamic mic. There is, however, an occasional problem with bass feedback that I have not experienced with other mics. It is, however, controlable with an alternate placement of my subwoofer and turning down the bass on my mixer.Overall, I'm impressed with the mic."
4,Seems like a good value,"Length:: 2:24 MinsAs you can see in the video, this is a fairly solid mic stand. It seems like a good value for the money. Also featured in the video are theNT3 Condenser Microphoneand theBlue Microphones Kiwi 20 Foot Quad Microphone Cable.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. So, please vote (the ""Was this review helpful to you: Yes or No"" buttons) and leave a comment if you'd like, even if it's just to say, ""Hi!"" I respond to all comments so feel free to ask a question about the product. Also, when you leave a comment, I will go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy.Thanks, Claire"
1,Poor Quaility Boom,"I ordered this on a black Friday sale for $14.99. I thought...hey!... for $14.99 I don't really care if it only lasts a year. Well... it lasted one time. I attached a pencil condensor mic to it... so nothing crazy. Upon boom adjustment the thumb screw thread striped out. It's now vertually unusable, unless I want to use duct tape.The reason this is sooo bad, is the fact that in some of these companies infinite wisdom, they decide that using powdered metal is a good solution for cost savings. Powdered metal is a very soft cast alloy, and not a good choice for taping holes in. The bolt is made of steel, so what part's gonna be the sacrificial lamb? The expensive one. Duh!Nice job On-Stage! I won't buy another product from you."
3,Shows promise,"One part bluegrass, one part soundtrack, this effort is more for atmospheric fans than guitar fans.More intent on setting a mood than presenting memorable melodies, it's easy-going, non-challenging background music with a couple of highlights that made the CD worth purchasing: The Spanish Plain and The Prairie's Edge.A quiet Sunday morning, a cup of coffee, and this CD. . . good start to the day.I would love to see him explore more melodic ideas -- but this shows promise."
4,Slow and smooth,"The music is minimal, but well orchestrated. The For Carnation manage to create a sparse, but delicately arranged feeling of melancholy and dark. It's beautiful music, mostly low tempo, with guitar, bass and drums.The percussion can hardly be said to ever evolve into any kind of danceable tempo, but doesn't drag, it simply wades along through thick tranquil atmospheres.Words are breathy and restrained, and all the instrumentation is weaved around the words to create a slowly moving delicate sound. The sparse instrumentation seems to lurk out of the darkness and loom for a moment before submerging into the background - all the while contributing to a wonderful, beautiful texture.It's a very very calm and subdued CD - but it's also very well orchestrated and beautiful.Headphones ++"
1,Piece of junk!!!...,"Was not compatible with our computer (and our computer is brand new with Windows XP!). With more jerking around we probably could have gotten the unit to work, but with the price you pay for it you shouldn't have to go to great lengths. The one DVD we did get to work was not good quality. We were very discouraged with this product and don't recommend anyone buying it."
3,"Software has trouble, Hardware works well.","I had some trouble installing the software. The HP software wanted ""Windows Installer"", that was not installed on my machine. It would have gone to the internet to get it; however, my computer was not connected. It should have been on the CD if it needs it! The help and manual are marginal. I could not find the command to erase a disk! On to the Hardware: I was pleasantly supprised to see it had a FireWire and a USB 2 connection. My notebook has the FireWire connection, and it works great. I burned a DVD+RW in about 30 minutes (4.5 GB). It was also a pleasant suprise to find that my DVD-ROM drive would read the DVD+RW disk. I tried a DVD-ROM to DVD+RW disk copy, and that ran well. I copied a bunch of files to a Disk formated for Windows explorer, it took longer, but was still resonable. It will take me a while to try the video editing software; however. I am very pleased with this product."
4,Hope springs eternal,"I previously reported some problems encountered in capturing, editing and burning a dvd from my digital video camera. I rated the unit a 2 star at the time, but noted at the end of the review that I was still hopeful. Well, many thanks to HP's email support for helping me work out the various bugs. It took a few reinstallations of the software program, but it seems to working just fine now. My home movie looks and sound good (lots of live music on the dvd), and I am actually quite pleased with the results."
2,Outdated,Hp has come out with a DVD300e version. This is an out dated version (DVD200e). Its ok if you don't mind having an out dated version. Hope this helps
1,dried out,There seems to be a quality control issue with this seller. The touch up paint I received was completely dried out. I am sure the person stuffing the envelope woul have seen that with more than a cursory glance
5,A good book with some realistic ideas,"I was amazed at how much someone like Reza Pahlavi (who has been away from his country for some twenty two years) has managed to stay in tune with popular Iranian sentiments.I was never a fan of monarchy(absolute or constitutional) but reading through this book and looking at the other available options, I'd say he represents Iran's best bet for a stable, secure and prosperous future.p.s. despite very harsh penalties, you will be amazed at how many copies of this book are being read and passed around inside Iran. People like this guy!"
1,Pahlavi dynasty: a dark part of history for Iranians,"Thinking about Pahlavis going back to Iran is like thinking about Romanovs to become the Tsars of Russia again. Nobody forgets the dictatorship of Reza Pahlavi's father. Totalitarianism of Islamic Republic regime does not justify going back in the history to revive the dead body of monarchy in Iran. For Iranians the name Pahlavi doesn't mean any thing more than a word like Qajar: These are exterminated dinosaurs who are interesting to watch but nobody wants them back in power again.Iran is a republic and it stays a republic, with or without the word ""Islamic"". Reza Pahlavi should forget about becoming a king in Iran and do his own business in America. Pahlavi family is a part of history for Iranians, ... and I have to say a dark part of it."
4,Excellent,"An Excellent CD of live worship that captures the real elements of praise. I have to say that this CD is superb...different to the usual style of hillsong's music, and a little closer to UNITED live (but still with it's own feel). The vocals are excellent and the production is very well done giving the guitars and drums a rich sound.One thing i have to point out is Natasha Bedingfield's vocals rip through the other backing singers (this is a good thing) as it adds to the sound of harmonies. all in all an excellent CD well worth the buy!"
5,Great book,This is an excellent resource. The illustrations and photographs are wonderful. Carolyn is not afraid to use actual photographs of male and female genetalia....how refreshing! There is nothing worse than medical text using drawings. In real life you will being dealing with the real thing....why not see the real thing in your textbooks! Beyond that...this book is very easy to read and understand. This is a book to keep and use well after you get out of college.
5,Sam Does It Again,"Sam Hawkins books are always a must have to me. I cross stitch a lot as I don't get out too much, and find his books composed with care. They inspire you to add and subtract bits so they ' live' for ever as I have not found one I could not return to and get another idea from. Well laid out in easy to read formatt. Clearly explained from cover to cover. Unusuall designs also included. An all round good buy."
1,Quality Takes A Fall,"I must have missed something, considering the amount of praise heaped on the author on the dust jacket, I thought I was about to read War and Peace. There was nothing new here, and the story line moved around like a heart monitor display - no consistent track - grabs something here, something there. This really is a very disappointing book."
2,Aln interesting book,"This book had an interesting story, but not captivating. I would have to think a bit before reading another book by this author if it was of the samw genre. There is a lot of information contained within but again, the story was not captivating for me.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,"beautiful, but...",I love the look of this headband. The colors and patterns are beautiful and unusual. It is very comfortable as well. The only difficulty is that the plastic relaxes. The second day I wore it the headband fell off when I turned my head. Not exactly the look I was going for. I have found that I can curl it up and put it in the bag they sent my hair combs in and it will return to it's former shape. It cannot be worn for more than a few hours without losing it's shape. Too bad!
3,Nice but overpriced,"It looks pretty good, and is comfortable for longer periods of time than most headbands, but at this price, I won't be buying any more of their multitude of styles and colors. One time purchase only."
4,Comfort Headband,"France Luxe has a very nice product. Their headband quality is very good, the color is beautiful, nice shine, but I would like to see a few more comb teeth for support."
5,I love this book!,"Why didn't I hear about this book until recently? Duprau is an eloquent writer and this is a deep and touching story. Filled with humor and insight, this book is about two women, their Zen practice, their love for each other and the tenuousness of life. More nuanced than Natalie Goldberg, Duprau's sense of irony carries the weight of her story."
1,not worth the money,This book stinks. There's so much focus on Buddhism that the characters are poorly developed.
5,The BEST book on fertility that you will ever find!!!,"Especially if you are older and ttc, please buy this book! It will give you so much hope and information! It explains all the reasons why acupuncture, having a natural, healthy diet and lifestyle, and taking herbs will help you find better health--and help you get pregnant! PLEASE do not think twice about buying this book. I have recommended it to many of my friends and they have all gotten so much out of it. You will, too! Get it, you will not be dissapointed!"
4,Proven methods of fertility reviewed by a male.,"As a male, I bought this book for my wife (who had 3 miscarriages). I started reading the book as it promoted nutrition and health as a way of making the whole woman strong enough to conceive. I really felt for the author, Randine Lewis, after her trials of losing her babies. But was also inspired by her research, persistence and hope to conceive. I have not grasped all of the Chinese Traditional Medicine described. However, by following the nutrition, herbal and massage methods, my wife is feeling better and more hopeful in her latest pregnancy. We now have a beautiful baby girl as of February 2009. Thank you Randine."
3,It Didn't Completely Work For Us,"My wife and I bought this book with great excitement. After adjusting our diet, trying acupuncture and Chinese Herbs, we realized we were not getting any closer to our goal: having a baby. We recently bought a few IVF books - most of which were filled with garbage - until we read ""What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant"".This book takes you step-by-step through the IVF process in a conversational voice, dedicates an entire chapter to ""Living a Fertile Lifestyle"" and lists a number of complementary therapies like acupuncture, aromatherapy, biofeedback, breathing techniques, guided imagery and so on.We had no luck until we stepped up our treatment plan and tried guided imagery and IVF. Together they worked beautifully.Whatever you do - make sure you read ""What to When You Get Pregnant"" along with this book. We can't say enough about it. It worked for us!"
2,Confusing,"This book must be read a few times before it is fully understood. Additionally, what is prescribed is difficult to access thereby limiting the usefulness of this book."
5,Very practical advise,I am already seeing an acupuncturist to support fertility. I appreciated the added insight this book gave to TCM and the authors willingness to work along side western medicine for positive pregnancy outcomes. Highly recommended.
4,Following the Dr's Advice,"I've been seeing an acupunturist for a year now. Throughout my treatments, I've had great results for several other issues ignored by regular doctors, but I still haven't been able to get pregnant.Recently he gave me this book and I nearly ate it up. It has really helped me to be more proactive with my treatments. I was a bit overwhelmed with the sections on herbal suppliments and I've left the responsiblity of deciding which herbs to use with my acupuncturist, but there is also lots of good advice for diet, lifestyle, and at home treatments. I've found the book to be a great source of information for anyone who is open minded to the power of combining Eastern and Western medicine. I hope the changes I've made will make the difference, and if it does, I'll gladly change my rating to 5 stars."
3,Not necessarily well written but makes a lot of sense,"This book made me hopeful that I can actually heal and improve my chances to conceive naturally. The book is poorly written with a lot of repetitions, illogical structure and bad selection of examples that sound like excuses. If you don't believe in Chinese Medicine this book is not going to convert you. But if you believe and if you can get through the book you will find a lot of good practical advice there."
4,New Israeli Study,This book is really great considering it offers natural ways of conceiving...THERE is a new study out of Israel - that HYPNOSIS doubles IVF success rate!! www.ourjerusalem.com. I also read and followed Michelle LeClaire's book/method of HYPNOFERTILITY and it worked. www.leclairemethod.com
3,Pregnancy is possible,I havent tried anything but then it turns out i became preganant before i even got to read the book so either it was the guys last few girlfriends or im just extremely firtile. but i would recommend trying this book if you want to consider trying to get pregnant
4,Very Imformative,"This book was very informative and helpful for someone trying to concieve naturally. Some of the information was not new to me for example some of the diet recommendations but acupuncture and chinese herbs as natural methods to enhance fertility was a plus. It inspired me to look into TCM in my area and began seeking treatment naturally before spending thousands of dollars on Western medicine fertility clinics. I am hopeful and glad I read it....I was not comfortable with the idea of hormone supplements and really stressed over the idea of what is called ""unexplained infertility."" I encourage every women struggling with troubles trying to conceive to follow channels you are most comfortable with and exhaust your options before settling on one medical ideal. Thanks for sharing your stories and recommending this book."
5,Understandable and practical,"This book was recommended by my acupuncturist and has a wealth of information! It really helps you understand the practice of acupuncture, herbs, and what YOU can do to maximize the benefits!"
5,First 28 Day Cycle EVER!,"I'm not pregnant yet, but after taking the recommended herbs for one month, I had my first 28 day cycle ever. I feel better and like my husband better. ;) I would recommend this book for any woman with abnormal cycles that wants to feel ""normal""."
4,Interesting reading,"Very informative. Love the author's perspective which is a combo of Western medicine, Eastern medicine, and a woman who has suffered through this. I have made multiple changes in my lifestyle since reading this, and feel more positive now. I can't say if they have improved my fertility (still not pregnant), but I do think I am headed in the right direction now."
5,It WORKED for us!!!!!!!!,"An absolute MUST for infertile couples. I was fed up of western medicines answers to my 'unexplained' infertility and so purchased this book as an alternative. Within a few months of acupuncture and dietary changes, we became pregnant after YEARS of being unable to conveive. (Now my 1 year old is running around giggling at his new found ability to walk). The book makes a lot of sense and is very user-friendly. It addresses many of the known causes of infertility from both the western and eastern perspective. I had to read it a few times to really digest all of it, but I recommend to all infertile couples without reserve. It even offers suggestions for treating male infertility."
5,for lay people and professionals alike,"Although the main approach to infertility in this book is from traditional Chinese medicine standpoint, it is a very hands on, help yourself to better fertility kind of book. I have read many books on infertility and this one gives the most self-help tips.Dasha Trebichavska,licensed acupuncturist treating fertility issues in San Francisco"
4,Very informative,"This book is really detailed and packed with information. I learned a lot about my own body and how/why it does what it does. In particular, I found the acupressure sequences described to be amazing. I recommend this to anyone who has been given a dark diagnosis or been told they ""just won't get pregnant"". Try this out! It could be what makes your dreams come true.Another great ""alternative"" and/or complement to ART isThe Fertile Female: How the Power of Longing for a Child Can Save Your Life and Change the Worldby Julia Indichova. She has a website and workshops too - you can check her and her work out at [...]. Blessings to you all!"
5,Interesting book if you want to take fertility cure even further,This book really takes you deeper into the mysteries of Traditional Chinese Medicine and gives you useful guidelines for improving your health and hopefully also your fertility.
3,Wiggles Pillowcase,My grandson is a big wiggles fan and this was purchased to make his visit more enjoyable. It did the trick.
4,My 2-year old loves it.,My son loves the pillow case. Price is reasonable. I'm thinking of getting another one for him.
2,There are far better books on the writing process,"This book was intended as a master's thesis and in many ways it reads like one, rather than a book intended for a general audience. It is overly personal in tone, focusing too much on the author's own experience rather than using literary examples. If you are looking for good books to develop your own writing, you would be better off with On Writer's Block by Victoria Nelson, Writing a Novel by Dorothy Bryant, or any of the books on fiction writing by Nancy Kress or John Gardner."
4,Not the prettiest gloves but they do the job,"I use these when doing yardwork, digging or transplanting flowers & plants to keep the dirt to a minimum and also to avoid getting blisters. They do the job although I wouldn't mind if they came in some more interesting colors/patterns besides mud brown."
5,Engaging,"This book is compiled nicely, and without wordiness which can make studies of ancient Rome dull. Watch for the addressees of Pliny's letters to learn more about the interaction of Rome's movers and shakers. Read and then reread as you will have missed details if you go too fast!"
1,Disappointing,Karaoke: Bryan Adams & ForeignerThis is not a Karaoke CD as there are no words appearing on screen just the audio. They give you the words on paper to sing along. Definately not what I expected and I am very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone and it should not be listed under the karaoke catergory.
3,Yummo !!!!,"Wonderful earthen heavy smell, this deep flavor should be used spareingly until you get the flavor intensity as you desire. - TIP ** Keep it in a dark cupboard sunlight ruins it. Adds a mysterious flavor to salad dressing's."
1,junk,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON IT LASTED 7 WEEKS AND THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE IT OR FIXIT AS I LIVE IN BRASIL. ITS JUST JUNK AND THE LOCAL NEC DEALER SAID IT HAD BEEN REFURBISHED ONCE WAS NOT A NEW ITEM. IN OTHER WORDS A REPALCE AND RESHIP AS NEW. GOOD LUCK IF YOU BUY THIS OR ANY ITEM FROM AMAZON. THE NO SERVICE COMPANY.
2,Not that great,"The concept is a good one for a guide book of a very scenic region of the United States. However, the actual implementation of that idea if poor. The maps are horrible. Bad copies of old maps that are barely readable. The directions are confusing and difficult to follow. The writing is stilted and often confusing. Overall, I can't recommend this book at all."
5,Just the good ole' noise.,"This double set showcases the insane noise that was AxCx before they signed to Earache Records. You get all of the classic out of print 7"" records along with stuff that is only availble here, like the swell demo from 1988 and some really crummy live recordings. If you don't already have the Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and Old Stuff 2 CD's I'd highly recommend this, or if you do have those and are a collector geek like me then you need to get this anyways. Oh yeah, they cover a Muppets song on one of the Another EP tracks, its spooky."
1,Just crappy noise...,"Every song sounds like a young kid having a tantrum. It's really just noise. It doesn't incorperate any actual talent. Most songs are devoid of a beat. It's friggin' hilarious and is obviously a total joke, but it's only funny for so long. You can't actually follow a beat or get into any songs any more than you could get into the beat your TV makes on a channel you don't get."
4,This is gonna rock!,"As soon as I saw Top Gun: Combat Zones I thought to myself ""I have to get it"". I used to enjoy playing the Top Gun game for the original NES, and this game looks fifty times more fun. You can fly eight different planes, from the classic F-14 Tomcat to the exotic V-22 Osprey, to the old-but-true F-4 Phantom. You can fly in various campaigns from the Arctic from the Gulf (you know which one) to South East Asia. Unfortunately, this game has no two-player mode as far as I could find. Half the fun of combat flight games is dogfighting human opponents (Incase you were wondering, the other half is a mixture of good graphics and fun gameplay). If it were not for this minor fault, I would've rated it five stars. Otherwise, it looks like this game is gonna ROCK! Definitely something gamers should buy."
1,Top Crap,"This is one of the worst games ever made. I remember the old NES version and if you played that today, it would be about 20 times better. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!Seriously, there are tons of games so much better than this it's ridiculous."
5,great game,I love it looks like a great game.can't wait for it to come out. Ilove the movie and I like jet fighting games
3,Nick-seasoned gamer,"I tell ya, this was one sweet game, but waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy too easy. The controls are great and graphics are superb, but it almost seemed that the further i got into the game, the easier it got and before I knew it, I beat the game. And another bad part is there is no multipleyer (which they could have easily made for it) and hardly andy replay value. There are some bonus planes to unlock, so that should take you a little longer, but like I said, it was tooooo easy. I strongly suggest renting, not buying this game"
4,Good game with some bad design features.,"I really like flying games and this is a good one, but there are a few annoying items.I've crashed several times because when messages come in, control of the aircraft is stopped and returned at the end of the message. This is OK most of the time but for others it means a crash. A message window in a corner would be much better.The heads up display differs depending on the display option selected (plane in the picture or not). There is no heads up display in quickstart free flight.Afterburner or lower thrust means near-instant speed changes."
2,not horrible,"caetainly not great though. Everything seems way out of proportion in this game. The aircraft all move incredibly slow. There no sense of speed whatsoever. the scall of the vehicles is so out of whack it almost makes me want to quit playing in disgust. Tanks about about a fifth of the size of an F-15, let alone trucks. Hell, apparently f-15's are even bigger than battleships! But don't worry, battleship can also be destroyed easily with bullets. the graphics are a little better than one would find in a nintendo 64 version also. If there's any saving grace to this game it's that it is TH EONLY flight sim game on game cube. It is kind of fun to try to spot a small group of bombers in the clouds over a city too, but that's about it."
3,Pretty Good,This game is pretty good. It is very realistic but it is really hard. This game doesn't have multiplayer either which dissapoints me.
2,refuses to grow on me,"Philip Glass and his music are large inspirations in my life. I listen and live his music on a daily basis. I just got finished listening to ""The Photographer"" - a masterpiece he composed years before this. Unlike ""The Photographer"", ""Symphony No. 5"" feels thin and exhausted. There are fragments of this piece that stand out and are lyrical and beautiful. The first two sections -""Before the Creation"" and ""Creation of the Cosmos"" - are perfect. The rest muddles together in my mind until the disc stops. Rarely will I ever even put in part two. I wonder if it is different live and in person, but at home in my stereo, it grows tiring and unpassionate."
5,Saw This On Good Morning America,"Then I picked it up and read it. An amazing book. I was able to use the advise immediately and found that it helped me get what I want at work and at home with my husband and children. I don't expect to need the chapters on cars, houses or divorces but the other chapters are directly applicable to things I have to deal with every day."
3,"Okay, but much better negotiating books out there.","This book has a lot of suggestions for how women can be more effective negotiators. However, if you're looking for a book to read I found Women Don't Ask by Linda Babcock to be much more insightful and a much better read.This book is written by a man and his daughter and some parts of it come off as a bit patronizing. There are a number of instances when the daughter recounts anecdotes about how her father taught her negotiating skills that somehow just bothered me."
5,Theory Development any1 can understand,"If you are a social science student doing research and would like to do something different (from theory verification) this is the book for you. Grounded Theory as explained by Glaser and Strauss is useable, even to the novice. Soon you too will be on your way to theory development!"
3,i have to admitt it,"This game when i first got it was hard. The first level was the easiest of the game, but the other levels are a lot harder than that. I have to say that this game was somewhat boring. It had poor graphics and when u aimed it was not exactly acurate. This game has a good and bad side. The single- player was boring. The mode with multiple players was AWeSomE. The multi- player mode had tons more wepons than the single- player mode. I reccomend u should only rent this game, and not buy it."
4,An honest opinion,I will admit that this isn't the best game I have ever played but it is still a very good game. I have to admit that the best part about this game is the price. You just can't beet $10 for an above average PS2 game.
3,The same old thing...,"This game has not changed at all since Turok on the N64, a pretty game and fun to play but having nothing new to surprise me really let me down. I didn't purchase the game until it was really cheap because of all the bad reviews in mags and from peers. I would be {upset} if I had spent half a bill on this game. If you never played the originals it might be a nice buy."
1,Suspicious Reviews - AVOID THIS GAME!,"I find it suspicious that most reviews are anonymous, or written before the gamer has played the game. This game is HORRIBLE! The graphics on the PS2 version are worse than the N64! The framerate lags at a low teen figure, the textures are amateurish, and the movement looks like a hastily created episode of South Park. I bought this game, played it for six hours, and returned it in disgust! AVOID THIS GAME at ALL cost. No wonder it has been so over-hyped!! It is a horrible example of a rushed, unimaginative, terrible game!!"
1,"Good, but not good enough","OK. First off. The game was alright, but not as good as Turok 2 for N64. You have so many missions too do in TE, but they are very short. In Turok 2, they gave you like 7 missions, but they lasted a long time. The weapons in TE are good, but again the weapons in Turok 2 were better. I would advise you to just rent the game and not buy it. I bought it and I wish I wouldn't have. Just my advice."
2,"Beautiful, but bad play control...","I am not a fan of first person shoot em up games, but after reading reviews of this one, I thought I'd give it a try... Mistake. It was a very beautiful game as far as graphics and scenery, but the play control was CRAZY DIFFICULT! Options weren't easily accessed, and jumping is near impossible! If you aren't a fan, but think you'll give it a try, don't waste your time. I took mine in to a trade in video game shop and got Arc The Lad, instead."
4,Turok Evolution,Turok is a hot game.You go through tons of levels facing raptors and dinosaurs with guns.Watch out 4 the snipers!The game also has a great varity of weapons.At some points this game gets fustrating because a level could last up to a half hour and if u die at the end u have to start over. but in other cases this game is great.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!,"I thought this game would be awesome judging from the screens and movies that I had seen online. I rented before buying and was instantly sorry for wasting just $5 on this game!The graphics are bland and cartoonish...the graphics in Turok 2 were far more impressive (even though the frame-rate was problematic). The game suffers from HORRIBLE pop-up...grass will suddenly appear just 3 or 4 feet in front of you. The characters in the game are lacking in detail and the AI is lousy.The weapons are cool, but after watching the animations one or two times they become old. Overall, I was supremely disappointed with this game. I have been a fan of the Turok series from the beginning and I am a big fan of the PS2. However, this game looks like a rushed product that does not tap the full power of the PS2. Don't waste [your money.]"
3,"Ultraviolence, but still just another first-person shooter","I rented this game because I was a huge fan of Turok 1 for the N-64. After playing it for a while, I realized that it's just another Doom clone. The graphics, especially the blood and gore are crazy violent and explicit, and some weapons would make Ghengis Kahn jealous. For example, there is a weapon called the ""swarm bore,"" which is a gun attatchment that fires hundreds of tiny fast-spinning screws that bore into the enemies (lizardmen) flesh and tear off its limbs and head, with much blood and drill in bone and flesh sounds. AND YOU THOUGHT GRAND THEFT AUTO WAS VIOLENT!!! Anyway, its just another FPS, and it should be kept away from young children."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"I LOVE THIS GAME, IT'S JUST SO BRUTAL ON DINOSAURS AND REPTILE ARMIES (MUTANT LIZARDS)!!! THE GAMEPLAY IS SO HEART-STOPPING, THE STORY IS JUST FANTASTIC AND THE WEAPONS ARE JUST TOTALLY AWSOME!! THE MULT-PLAYER IS UNLIKE ANY YOU'VE EVER SEEN (OR IN THIS CASE PLAYED)!!! THE LEVELS ARE OUTSTANDING, THE GRAPHICS ARE EXCELLENT, MAKE THAT PERFECT!!! THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IS PROBABLY HARD, WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT, AND I'VE COMPLETED THE GAME!!! BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE GTA3, OR GTA:SA OR SNAP YOUR GTA:VICE CITY DISC AND REPLACE IT WITH THIS ONE, OR IF YOUR JUST BORED OR ALL YOUR GAMES SUCK JUST SO LIKE REALLY BAD OR YOU JUST LIKE BUYING OR COLLECTING VIDEO GAMES!!! MUST BUY!!THANKS FOR READING!!!"
5,pull my pants down!,"Turok is a very fun fps with lots of ugly dinos and this one looks to have great graphics and intense game play. i had an old version of this and it had this one gun which drilled this bomb thing into an enemies head and blew it up. thats freakin' pretty tight. and the multiplayer was awsome too. shoot the monkey. thats all i have to say. well, maybe not. one person is a monkey with no gun and all the other people have to go and kill the monkey beore it reaches the thing that turns him back to normal. its really a blast. it's just to bad this comes out so close to need for speed (sept. 9th)."
1,Take this garbage back,The game itself is hard to follow along with the cheesy bad guys and the boring story line im sorry i ever had the misfortune of playing this game. Its a disgrace to the Turok brand and i just dont see how the developers at Acclaim let this glitchy frustrating abomination they call a game out of their doors. I believe it was rushed for the holiday season. Instead of pushing the game to get done they should of gone back and fixed the choppy graphics and all the popup foliage in the game. I definitely dont recomend it.
1,This game sucks....,"This game ... It says it is 1-4 players simultaneosly, but it isnt. It is only 2... so it ... if you have friends and want to play. Either that or my multi taps b, c and d ports are messed up. Also the single player is too linear. You can barely explore or anything. The graphics are ok, but the sound effects ARE VERY BAD!! Everything sounds so cheap and inhuman. I rented this at blockbuster, I hope the game is messed up or something because it stinks. Turok 2 was alot better. I think gaming companies are all about graphics now and not gameplay; which is really sad. Some where I read that this game was going to be awesome, I totally disapprove. All the reviews I read anyways only talk about ""what they heard and saw"" Do not rent this game!! Wait for armored core 3."
2,Bad Battery Life,I purchased this battery not quite a year ago and now am shopping around for another one. Our original battery lasted 5 years. Time to find something that lasts longer.
3,OH. MY. GOD.,"Like sticking needles into your eyes.This CD is extremely hard for an adult to listen to. The tunes are repetitive and annoying. Dr. Tick Tock himself is even worse. On top of this, I don't find the songs to be particularly educational. You learn to say please and thank you, not to talk to strangers . . . and then what a worm does and a tv does (as in, shows images -- not how it works).I would give 1 star (or zero) except that there are so few educational kids' CDs out there, that I'd like to give Dr. Tick Tock a little bit of credit. And, I hate to admit it, but my 3-year-old does like the CD."
2,Not what I expected,"My first camera was a Mustek, and I sold it to someone because they were in urgent need of a camera to take on vacation. After reviewing the reviews for this camera, I said I may as well give it a try. Wrong answer. The pictures are horrible. They don't come out clear regardless of what setting it is on. I would not recommend this camera."
5,mustek digital camera,I used the camera to take pictures of my new grandchild. It seems very easy to use and I am continuing to learn new things about the camera. The size and options on the camera are good and now waiting to try the video option feature.
5,Pioneer in sorting algorithms awaits new edition by Knuth.,"As the inventor of numerous algorithms described in Prof. Knuth's Vol. 3, 1st edition, I am very interested in his 2nd edition, when available. My 1956 MIT thesis, ""Information Sorting in the Application of Electronic Digital Computers to Business Operations,"" was very well treated in his first edition in 1973. I anxiously await his 2nd."
5,Double check your usage before your buy,Good quality stainless hinge for marine or RV usage. This part number comes 2 to a package so be sure of the quantity you order.
3,Thinking Anthropologically???,"I have Patricia Rice for Anthropology 105, although she is a good teacher, I am skeptical of her literary skills. She made us read her book, which I believe would be more appropriately titled ""Thinking with Common Sense"". However, if you are a student of any level that has problems understanding a class or subject, I recommend this book. If you can look past the Anthropology-specific information there is actually a lot of valuable advice on how to learn information even if it does not make sense to you."
3,Cannot Detect Server!!,"I've owned this receiver now over a year. Overall, it's been pretty good with the exception of the network function, which has never worked (cannot detect server). I've allowed it thru all firewalls and even connected a cat 5 cable straight from the cpu to the receiver( bypassing the router); same result! Kenwoods' online tech support takes forever to respond and insists it's a firewall issue. Also, the component assignment feature is difficult to set-up."
3,Good receiver with inoperable add-ons.,Network option never worked. Could never see server.Poor speaker conections.Component video swithching is poor. Shows banding and breaks up in heavy action.Receiver is very detailed though.
4,Great communication tool,"Dinner time and road trips are fun with this book. The questions lead to great conversations that I may not have had with my chldren otherwise. The questions for parents can sometimes be tough, which is probably why my oldest loves to ask them. It is geared for children of a junior high school age or older, yet my four year old enjoys playing as well. If you have a tough time getting more than one or two word responses when talking to your children - this book is for you. Not only will it help you to get to know children's thoughts a feelings a little better they get to know you better too."
2,The Sacrament of the Present Moment,"I was disappointed in the quality of the paper used in the book. If I was going to give a book as a gift, I would not choose Amazon, for that reason. -I do appreciate the availability of the numerous titles, though."
5,My favorite powder,"This powder is wonderful. I have no idea why it is so hard to find in stores now, so I took this opportunity to purchase several. I never want to be without it!"
5,Miss this in the stores,"Can't get this in any local stores, have used it for years. Glad I found it here. Works great for heat rash."
5,Too much fun for you!,"This game is amazing. If you like Everquest or Bauldars Gate, then you will fall in love with Kingsfield. Whether you like the strategy or the fighting, this game is perfect."
2,i'm glad it isnt just me!,"I'm glad that i am not the only one that thought this game .... I got board after 15 minutes. What a waste of [money]! Oh well, that will teach me not to buy games before I rent them. I suggest that everyone should learn from my mistake, and rent first!"
1,what were they thinking!,"I too played this game for all of ten minutes. The game play is FAR TOO SLOW AND AWKWARD. The game style is similar to doom but worse. Since I couldn't force myself to play it any longer, I cannot offer much advice beyond the opening scenes.Trust me, don't waste your time. If by chance you ignore my comments and do play the game, please do other gammers a favor and offer your honest eval. I'll bet it isn't very kind either."
1,DO NOT PLAY,"This is the most tedious game I have ever played, and I am an ardent RPG fan. Only for serious dungeon crawlers."
3,Long live the Zero Boyz!,"The Zero Boyz were very popular in the 80's in Indianapolis. I was what you would call a ""groupie"" of the Zero Boyz, and ultimately married the guitar player, Terry Howe (Hollywood).The band had a very hard edge and was just getting started when they broke up. I have a collection of Zero Boyz albums that I have passed on to my twin boys, because their father Terry passed away 2 years ago. I have always loved punk rock bands, and I think the Zero Boyz were one of the best!"
5,Vicious Circle,One of the best hardcore albums of all time unfortunatley often overlooked! Every song is a gem.
1,Good Theme but Nasty Movie,"I sure hope Blacks have in general progressed much more than this picture depicts. Women sleeping with men on the first date is not only disrespectful and nasty but very unhealthy. I was so upset with the 'man' on the toilet; some things should not be in a movie; that's one of them. It was not the top rate movie I expected. My screen was so small it was maddening; because of the borders, only 1/3 of the picture was actually shown. It kept stopping and refusing to play. Good theme but bad movie. I do not recommend this movie; what a waste of money!'"
1,"Not a durable key ring, but cute","My husband is an assistant coach for our daughter's soccer team- so we got this for him for Father's day. Within 3 weeks the first ""D"" that is attached to the ring broke in half and now is unusable. So, not worth the money if it only lasts a couple weeks."
1,If I could leave minus 5 stars..I would,This has to be the worst toilet seat ever. Do not buy this. I purchased this in January and by April it had disintegrated. Yes you heard me right. It looks gorgeous but you would not expect any less from this cherry piece....but it can not handle moisture in a bathroom! The metal joints totally disintegrated and left a terrible stain on my toilet. It broke in half and is utterly bad. Do not buy it.
4,Decent Purchase,Product works as advertised. I was impressed with how fast shipping was. The color matches pretty well with the picture. It is a maroon color. Installation was a breeze. The only complaint is that it shows stains and water marks very easily.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I have cherry cabinets in my bathroom and was looking for a toilet seat to match. This one did, and perfectly! It arrived in perfect condition, well packed, and had all of the substantial hardware included. The hinges are shiny brass which also compliments the handles on the cabinets. It looks rich and elegant, cleans easily, is fairly light-weight but feels solid, and was much cheaper than ordering directly from the manufacturer. Another happy Amazon customer."
3,Mayfair Cherry Toilet Seat,"The Mayfair 9602BR178 was purchased as a replacement for the (nearly) identical item purchased four years ago. The original item failed recently when both hinges broke. We purchased the new item for reasons of decor and because the cost was lower than in 2005. We are pleasantly surprised to find that the new item has a more attractive ""grainy"" appearance and seems more well made than the original, but in all respects, they seem to be the same product."
4,Cherry like Wood Veneer Toilet seat,This is the 2nd one I purchased. The first one I purchased about 10 years ago and the 2nd replaces that one. They don't last as long as a regular white plastic seat but I like it so much better for my powder room. It is very smooth and it is warmer in feel. The look to me is an upgrade to the norm. It blends well with the cherry wood vanity in my powder room. This product is veneer. So eventually the veneer separated. However it lasted 10 years.
3,Not too impressed,"I am not too impressed with the quality of this product. The hinges are of inferior quality. The last seat I bought at least had solid studs with actual stainless steel nuts that you could tighten down really well. This seat also showed up with a scratch. Having the option to do this again, I would not buy this seat. I expect the hinges on this seat to not last long at all."
1,Arrived Damaged,"A cursory inspection of the toilet seat did not reveal that the top and bottom had crushed spots on the sides, since I didn't pull it all of the way out of the box upon delivery. I was busy and by the time I got around to installing it and saw the damages, I had kept it too long to return it, so I'm out 28.44 for nothing. It otherwise looked okay, if not a tad cheap...but after all, it IS a toilet seat."
4,Impressive Debut,"What an album ! These guys sound like a cross between Death,Slayer and Iron Maiden. I haven't heard something this new in ages. The best song has to be Incisional. It has the right mix of riffs, speed and mood. Wait the 4 weeks, it's worth it."
5,The best beginner book I've seen,"I've watched some hold'em and played some with friends. But never had a clue what would be a good strategy -- so when I saw there was an Idiot's Guide, I thought it would be perfect. The chapter about odds gave me the math without making my eyes glaze over (a major plus, since I'm not a math guy). I'm gearing up to use some of the strategies here on my friends the next time we play."
5,OTTIMO LIBRO,"scrivo in italiano cosi' mi capite ITALIANI.Onestamente posso dire che e' un OTTIMO libro,tutte le tattiche del gioco PRE FLOP,FLOP,TURN,RIVER e molto altro.Molto facile da capire(linguaggio semplice).CONSIGLIATO per i principianti e NON"
2,Very nice but flawed,"Exquisitely detailed, and a joy to have on display, especially for an Evil Dead fan. Fun: 2 stars - Like most McFarlane figures (and most figures altogether) there is no fun to something like this. It cannot be played with, it cannot be posed. But it's not really meant to be. It's a figurine, not an action figure. Educational value: 5 stars!! - There is no education required save to show the joy and rapture that is Army of Darkness. Hail to the king. Durable: 2 stars - The figure itself is very durable.. unfortunately, the accessories are not. The entire purpose of the figures pose is to hold 2 swords. Both swords are exceptionally fragile. One of the sword blades tapers next to the hilt, and therefore broke completely off the first day that I had the item. Very dissapointing."
2,poor quality,I agree with the previous review! the same exact thing happened to me. Dropped them once and the plastic tab broke and the clipper head would not stay on. I also used tape to hold it in place and continued to use the clippers. Then the battery started to die. Same timetable...2 years. Love that the clipper is so quiet and cordless but really the body should not be so delicate...after all.. the blades are good quality metal.
4,"Best Complete Mekons Album Since ""I (Heart) The Mekons""","""Journey"" is the best Mekons album since ""I (Heart) The Mekons,"" and maybe since their epic ""Rock'n'Roll."" They crafted this bugger, and didn't just toss it off, like 1998's ""Me."" Jon Langford returns in full, if mellow, form, and Sally Timms, fresh from the accolades of her solo album, turns in her best performance since ""Retreat to Memphis."" Why does this work so well, even as it rocks so lightly? Mostly because, after years of distraction -- the Waco Bros., solo albums, their rebirth as a conceptual art band -- the Meeks are back as a bloody BAND, and they play like one. If you have friends who've never heard the Mekons, but have heard you rave about them, tell 'em to dive in. It's fine."
1,"""Shiver me timbers, I wish I hadn't bought this.""","Okay, Maybe they have thier place and based on the previous reviews its good to see that they have a faithful fan base. Yet I thoroughly disliked this album. It was a bit like old (very British) 2-tone ska with an overdramatic Nick Cave / Captin Blackbeard as the vocalist. I appreciate it for being a ""new"" genre. But please don't advertise it as something its not. Ther are a few interesting dub reggae bass lines, and otherwise its worth having if your into very cockney, very campy pirate drinking songs. But if you are looking for atmospheric and emotional folk... Don't buy this."
2,Maybe I'm not using enough...,"I used a quarter of this product (as the bottle indicated... 1 oz of a 4 oz bottle). I lubed my deck very thoroughly-- or so I'd thought! In one month (not the 150 miles or 6 months prescribed by my treadmill) I noticed that my deck was completely dry once more. Normally I use the horizon lube for my treadmill and it lasts pretty much right up til my machine beeps at me to let me know the time has come, but the bottle was completely empty and needed it very quickly. So I went ahead and ordered via amazon prime overnight so I could get right back to running. Needless to say, I am disappointed (though I suppose it did get me through until I could get my normal brand). I would not reccommend this due to its lack of longevity."
1,Not as I expected for 14.95,"Hard to get to middle of belt, made no difference to the belt still not smooth. Would not recommend buying."
2,"Difficult to apply, better options exist","This was difficult for me to apply. The instructions included with the spray were vague, so when searching for better ones I discovered there are much easier to use products that exist. I have a LifeSpan treadmill so I figured getting the LifeSpan spray was fine, but now I wish I had searched more before buying this."
4,A little goes a long way,I had failed to lubricate our office treadmill for many years and came across this on accident on amazon and got a bottle. It works well and a little goes a long way. The only problem is trying to get it everywhere under the belt without getting any on top of the belt. But once you get it under the belt it makes a big difference.
1,Not happy,I was not pleased with this product. For $14.99 it was a very small amount. Four ounces to be exact. It is not an aerosol spray making it very difficult to apply. It does not come with a straw for the nozzel making it a messy experience because you need to apply the silicone underneath the tight fitting belt.
3,Good product but user unfriendly,"I've no problem with the lubricant itself, but selling it without a way to project the product over to the tread belt is ridiculous. How hard would it be to add a tube to the outlet? I would NOT BUY this product again for this simple reason."
3,good product,"I have only had to use it once on my treadmill belt so far. but it seems to be working. belt is holding up well, i use my treadmill 4 days a week and use the spray twice a month."
3,it lubes,"It's a lubricant, and it's made of silicone. 'nuff said.No, but really, I can't say I noticed a difference with the treadmill after I put it on, but being that it is a lubricant, it certainly can't hurt the treadmill. I used about 1/3 the bottle to lube up the undertrack portion below the belt. So depending on your treadmill size, you should get around three uses out of this product before it runs out. I'd buy it again when the time comes."
3,Treat your treadmill belt.,"Wasn't sure if this was totally worthwhile, but it did seem to help our belt run more quietly and smoothly."
3,Slicker than a ....,Yeah.... I won't finish that. I bet you get the idea though. I just wish it cane with an applicator. It can be a bit tricky getting the spray every where it should be. You must be careful not to get this on the treadmill deck. This would be for all the obvious and admittedly comedic reasons. ..... And done!
2,It didn't really fix the problem.,"Our treadmill has a fairly loud noise when running at high speed. However, this lubricant didn't really fix this problem so far. We will use the treadmill a couple of more times, hoping that it takes the lubricant a while to work on protecting the machine."
5,Great Product-Easy To Apply-NO Odor,"""Bought this with my purchase of my treadmill....easy to use with the pump sprayer and like others have said there is no odors. Nice product and will re-order in a year."""
3,Blah,"Very difficult application.When you spray it, little drops of product go everywhere and surfaces become slippery.Also the spray stream is not long enough to reach the center of the treadmill."
4,A little hard to use....,"This is a good lubricant, but it's hard to use on the belt because your hands get greasy and then the nozzle moves from side to side. They need to put an extension tube-thing on the end."
3,ok gel,This gel is Not easy to open and use. The amount is limited. But there is no obvious flaw. May only last 2 or 3 times for lubrication.
4,Great product! But hard to spray...,"I have an Image treadmill - and this spray worked great for the belt noises it was starting to have. The only down side is that the bottle doesn't come w/ a long nozzle, which makes it almost impossible to spray at times if you have to 'lift' the belt and aim the bottle under the belt."
3,would be better if it came with better instructions,this product is good for what it does and priced right. It would be better if it had an attachment that allowed for more accurate spraying as well as more detailed instructions. I bought a used treadmill that was dragging and needed lubbed so I got this but wasn't sure how to do it. The instructions aren't very clear.
4,Pure Silicone,It's difficult to find pure silicone to lubricate the decks on treadmills. Most products at auto parts stores have petroleum products in them. The only problem is that it is difficult to apply without a propellent.
5,great for a home treadmill,"I have a home treadmill that I use 4-5 times per week. Have found this very helpful in keeping it running smoothly.A note for those of you who have never used lubricant on your treadmill -- if you're like me, you might be confused as to the type of lubricant you need and how to apply it. I found several videos online which really set my mind at ease. It was nice to actually see it being done rather than just read about it in the instructions.I have been happy with this product. Will be buying again."
2,Not the best - for me,"I guess it would depend on your need. For me, I thought the full brief would be more absorbent than a bulky pad. I thought wrong. I'll go back to my pads during the day. For the price, it was worth the try."
4,Tally Ho! Buy It!,"Greed leads to life and death conflicts in the Irish countryside. There are lots of great characters in this novel - good guys tainted with the gift of blarney, bad guys you love to hate and manipulative women who know how to get what they want. Crissman has a knack for letting us glimpse inside the head of his characters while maintaining a sporting pace. And for equine enthusiasts, there are lots of horses and riding scenes set in a historic hunting lodge. The more I read, the more I liked. Tally Ho! I give it 4 stars."
3,Disappointed,"Bought flash for my Maxxum 5D to use for longer, wider coverage in large rooms. Did some comparison tests against the built-in flash on the camera and the pics with the external flash weren't as well lit as the built-in. These shots were taken at about 15 feet. Haven't tried any yet at the range I bought it for, but would have expected the tests to be better."
3,I sort of agree...,"While I agree that 2012 isn't going to be the end of the world, and I agree that we should take care of the planet we have been blessed with, I don't agree that we should go back a few thousand years where tribes burned their children in the name of false gods and tribes were constantly waring and torturing one another. I am still not sure where people get the idea that Aztecs or Mayans were peaceful. Archaeology has shown a different story. I would rather live in a lawful world where we responsibly use the resources God has provided. Again though, I do agree that 2012 is NOT the end of the world. The Mayans had many calendars, and the long calendar just marks the end of an age like any other."
5,AN ANSWER TO MY THEORY!,"I've watched several documentaries on this topic, but none of them touched on the right answer except for this one. It got right to the point with clear and precise details. I've finally found the answer!"
5,Indestructable?,"I haven't tried to destroy it yet, but I will do my best. Very nice whistle for the outdoors. It is loud, can't rust, easy to keep clean, and will, I'm sure, last a lifetime. If you are an outdoor person, you cannot afford to be without a good whistle! You never know when you're going to need to attract some attention."
4,"Historically significant recordings, off-center masters","The other reviews posted here are correct as to the historical value, as well as the entertainment value, of these recordings. James Europe's place in Jazz history is beyond dispute. I take issue with the re-mastering process.Some of the discs that these samples were taken from were not properly centered on the turntable during mastering. It varies from song to song from barely noticeable (""Mirandy"", ""Dixie is Dixie Once More"") to sickening (""Broadway Hit Medley"", ""Plantation Echoes""). A little more care would have made for a more enjoyable CD.The disc noise is not that much of a problem - it is endemic to the process, especially for acoustic Pathe discs (which is what these are). I could handle the surface noise if it weren't for the pitch bending with every revolution of the original disc.I haven't heard the other re-issue of these recordings yet; I just hope it's better."
4,Pleased,"Really liked the watch... The color was a little brighter than in the picture... It tells the time, date, a stop watch, and a light so that you can see in the dark... I like it because you don't have to buckle it, it just clasp right on you wriest.... so you can put on and take off your watch in no time!.. and people like me, who are always on the good.. this is the watch for you..."
2,Very Short,"I am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me, it says that its adujustable, but it can only be made shorter and not longer. For a kid this is a good jump rope, but its definitely not for a tall person."
4,"Nice, but","The set is nicely made , but a little ""clunky"" due to it's size. The clippers would be easier to use if they were a little smaller."
1,Do Not Buy,"It has been over a month, and I still haven't received my product from this company. I do not recommend using them."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The puppet listed above is described as a 10"" hand-puppet. I have seen this toy in person at stores in my town, and my son fell in love with it. When I discovered it here on Amazon for a fraction of the price listed at the store I was thrilled! HOWEVER, what arrived was not at all what this listing described. Other than it also being a Horton puppet, the 4"" finger puppet that arrived at my door was a sore disappointment. BUYER BEWARE: because this is a 3rd party seller you will have to go through the process of returning the item, waiting for it to arrive, and then waiting for a refund OR if you want to go ahead and pay a second time you can sit and anxiously hope that what arrives will be what you ordered. VERY disappointed. Particularly as this was a holiday gift for my child."
1,Tiny...not a hand puppet more like a finger puppet,"This was such a disappointment. I saw one similar at an education supply store and thought I could easily find the same thing for much less on Amazon. When I saw this one the picture matched exactly the other product I found in the store for much less. I received it in two days using prime shipping and was very sad when I handed this tiny little puppet to my five year old. The ""hand"" opening was so small she couldn't even fit her tiny hand in it. The product I received is nothing like what the picture showed. It wasn't even the same color, Horton was all gray instead of the two-tone Horton the picture shows. Unless you want this to fit on your finger and have a maybe a four inch puppet, do not buy this product."
2,No good...,"I could not use it, I tried to fix the plastic part of the passenger side mirror and did not work at all,even holding it for more than 5 minutes...plus, the inside rest dried off...it was a complete waste."
1,Rofl,"This DVD won't help you any. It's biased, therefore not reliable. And Jehovah's Witnesses are over 6.4 million around the world. Talk to them yourself instead of trying to read lies about them like in this book and other books that are suggested here about them.Mormons are a cult. ROFL they murder their family members and say god told them to do it....."
3,Best for younger gamers,"This game is not for older or experienced gamers.It is a fine game but the play is somewhat repetative and not so engaging for the grown-up gamer. I expect that younger games would have a good time with this though.That said the graphics are fine as is the sound. The levels and scenes are laid out so that there is plenty of variety which is always a good thing.One thing to note is that on some levels the the doorways are hard to see. They look more like someone shining a light in the shape of a door on the wall instead of a real door itself. Once you get used to this, though, it is very clear where the doors are."
3,Half-and-half,"It's okay, but I didn't go nuts about it.You have to be in the right mood to be willing to play this. It gets pretty boring after a while. And I ALWAYS turn off the unbeliveably annoying music; I just can't stand digital music. And if you want to go back to the main menu when you're in the middle of a level, you have to turn your entire GameBoy off and then on again. The basic moves are a little boring; Jump, Walk, Duck and Crawl. No white-nuckled shooting at bad guys. In fact, you are helpless; you have to avoid all the enemies instead of defeating them.Good game to get if you don't have anything to do most of the day."
3,Good and Bad,"This game is good and bad, fun and flawed, good and not good, so I would have given it a 2.5 but because of some good areas I gave it a three as instead of a two. I think some areas are fun, but some are just downright annoying. So I think you should only get it if you are crazy about Stuart Little. Other than those people I would only recomend if you rented first, because some may end up liking it, but not most people."
5,Serious and Thoughtful,"If you were expecting this album to be like all the other Voltaire albums, think again. It is heartfelt, honest, and emotional. It's definetly the cd your parents will love. Highlights on this album include ""Crusade"", ""Goodnight Demonslayer"", and my absolute favorite, ""The Happy Song"". If you're looking for something different, pick this one up."
3,Do NOT Represent All Silat Styles,"This book is really a good book. It analyzes in details the intricacies/'secrets' of silat concepts/techniques.UNFORTUNATELY, the book's analysis is mainly RESTRICTED to Sera Style only. It does NOT analyzes the concepts/techniques of other silat styles such as Cimande, Cikalong, Harimau, etc.I'm somehow disappointed on that part.Overall, it's a very good book though considering how RARE silat books are !!!"
4,Effective street self defense,I've been taking a Silat course and wanted some more information on the subject. It's not easy to find Silat books at your local bookstore. This book was informative but in order to understand the concepts you really need to see them at full speed. Sifu Richard Clear has some really good Silat dvd's that show all the techniques at full speed.
5,"No Matter Your Level, You'll Like This!","Here we have a decent depiction of how the various arts of the Archipelago may be practiced. It is more of a tactics and principles book than a mere techniques catalog, so it will appeal to those who have been in the arts for some years, as well as those who are simply striving for deeper understanding of the basics."
1,Nothing exciting.,"Really basic book, nothing of real interest. Maybe this book would be ok for a rank novice. No depth, really skims over important concepts. You could easily read this information on the internet for free. The book does go deep into how dangerous and great Indonesian martial arts are. Don't waste your time ."
4,awesome,Not a kids toy but gave it to an adult friend of mine and she loved it. She collects scary movie action ffigures and it was a great present.
2,"""Tony Todd in Toy Form? That's Terrifyingly Terrific!""","That's right, McFarlane finally gets the license to do Candyman [albeit from the direct-to-video Candyman 3, starring Baywatch babe Donna D'errico] As far as Clive Barker movie properties go, McFarlane hasn't had much luck with them, but here he succeeds with a decent head sculpt for Todd, and nails the whole exposed rib cage look under the trenchcoat. If you're a fan it doesn't get much better, if you're just a pick and choose collector rather than a completist, I'd pass."
5,A professional review - Dream Change Coalition Magazine,"Spiritual power has long been something attainable only to the few, often through years of study and deprivation. For most, connection to the divine was sought only through intermediaries. It is a time of great change, and rememberance. Rememberence of each of our divine core, of our individual connection, of our individual truth. At the dawn of the new millennium, Chuck Coburn's book, Reality Is Just An Illusion, comes at the perfect time, a primer full of practical ways to remember and empower ourselves.

5,Lighthearted and deeply moving...,This book describes the amazing personal experience which led former businessman Chuck Coburn into a full-time career as a professional psychic. Coburn recounts his odyssey in a very readable story which is both lighthearted and deeply moving.
4,Charles Atkins' 'Sweet Voice',"'Sweet Voice' is Charles Atkins' latest CD release. Previous releases include 'Diggin The Gold', 'The Blues Says It All' and 'Animal Called The Blues'. Unlike his previous releases, the 13 cuts (#14 'Floridas Song', was previously released on 'The Blues Says It All') focus on Mr. Atkins' soulful side. Charles gives The Blues a rest here and explores some R&B and Gospel sounds from his past.Of the 14 original tracks, Charles has penned 11, the other 3 having been wrought by his producer Mr. Greenlee. Eleven out of 14 isn't a bad number and Mr. Atkins' songwriting is definitely at the height of its power here. From the sweet lullaby of the title track Sweet Voice to the beautifully touching Angel Heaven, Charles Atkins has given his fans and the rest world some of the sweetest soul music ever."
3,good but not worth it,IT is a nice shirt and good material....dont know if it was really worth the 50 bucks tho... havn't washed it yet cuz i am giving it as a gift...i feel like it might shrink so that scares me
1,misrepresented,"I specifically bought this shirt because it was described as 100% cotton and it wasn't. The purchase price and shipping was refunded, but I had to pay the price of return shipping. I was very disappointed, since the product was misrepresented."
2,Fair on default,"I'm glad that somebody (Amazon) sells repalcement covers for large ironing boards. After two years of ironing around a permanent stain on my ironing board's old cover, I finally took the initiative to shop for a replacement. It was frustrating to find that department stores and fabric stores only had covers that were too small. Although I'm glad that Amazon had the cover, I was not quite satisfied for how the shipping took three times long as other Amazon products and for how the cover has printed red lines on it for style. Fortunately, the lines dont affect the clothes and tablecloths that I iron, but I still feel not entirely comfortable with the sight of those lines. Overall I'm glad I don't have to worry about that permanent stain on the old one, but I don't understand why it didn't ship at normal Amazon speed and only the ones with printed lines were available."
3,Fabric Stuck Together in Package,"Ill start with the positives. Shipping was super fast. The price was great. Less than $14.00. I got the costume that I was supposed to and it was true to size. Now the negative, I am not sure how to describe the costume upon opening. The shimmery red fabric was somehow fused together, like it had got hot or wet. I had to pull it apart and when I did that, the red color ripped from the fabric. So, instead of a skirt and cape made of red, it was a somewhat red and silver striped skirt and cape. It may not sound too bad but it really was. Overall, this would be a great costume. Very pretty and will last long. But, the manufacturer has got to stop the sticking together part. It ruins the costume."
5,Perfect,Perfect fit. It wasn't complicated at all and pretty simple for what I needed it for - did not require much planning on my part.
3,Costume not so short,"This costume was too big. I was worried that from the title description that it would be small so I got a medium and i'm 5'7"" and the skirt went to my knees. The top was way too big, even the sleeves were long. At least the cape covered up the safety pins I needed to make the top fit."
3,Bad sizing.... cute costume,"I bought the XS and had to have it tailored down! It was more like a S or M. It was very frustrating. The boot tops are also kind of a problem. They don't stay put. I was put together with pins and tape, but I did win ""Best Costume"" at my work party. It's very cute."
1,Worst product to buy!,I don't like this product at all. I did use it a little while until I found the lotion and like it alot better. This product is more like baby oil!
4,Used over 25 years ago !!,"I was pregnant 25 years ago and used Mothers Friend and used it over my stomach, breast and thighs. One bottle was enough, I would have gave it 5 stars but if I remember correctly I didn't care for the smell but I believe it kept me from getting any stretch marks anywhere and I went from an A cup to a large C. So I have just found out my daughter in law is pregnant and I will be buying her Mothers Friend for her, still good reviews after 25 years....keep up the good work."
5,Love it!,"I used this product when I was pregnant with my first daughter. I used it whenever my stomach itched and did not get any stretch marks. Throughout my whole pregnancy, I used less than 1 bottle. It is well worth the price. I am pregnant again and came for more because I think it is the main reason I didn't get any stretch marks. It's the only product I used."
5,Dewalt pressure washer gun side handle,MAKES HANDLING/AIMING OF GUN/WAND COMBO MUCH EASIER. AM SURPRISED MORE MODELS DO NOT OFFER THIS AS AN ACCESSORY.
2,No Directions!!!!,"This item has only one direction - take to a ""certified wireless phone technician"" to install this antenna. Save your money and don't get this item."
4,Decent game for older systems,"This game will play well on older systems, in case you have one. Action is sterotypical, but so are many FPS's. Not that bad, but newer games have better graphics."
4,Absoluteley sickening-ONLY PLAY IF YOUR REALLY MAD,"Because aside of the cool game play, great Jedi Knight II quality graphics and sound, very good AI, and both great sp and mp modes etc, the animated blood & gore + voilence in this game is too nasty. You can literally tear people apart by using just a knife to make their face a blood festival and just cut half of it off etc. It's nasty. And so are the blood sounds. They actuall BLEED when they fall to the floor. And limp when you shoot them in the leg. TOO REALISTIC! Besides that, it ran fine, especially with my new 9500 pro. I cranked up the resolution to 1024x768 and all other settings maximum and still ran like a smooth buttah. I don't suggest this game for gamers that can't take M rated quality gore & blood + animated voilence, or even AO quality, because this game is the nastiest game i have ever seen in my LIFE. I don't suggest this for every gamer...:/(although is a great game overall)"
5,DO NOT REVIEW GAMES BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED!,"Dude, the SOF Multiplayer TEST you have is exactly that, a test. How about waiting for the full version before writing a review? YOu have no clue about the main features of this title. Random Mission Generator for replay value, and trust me, the gore will be amazing. There is a video floating around of just how gory it can be. ... Just wait and see..."
5,Bada-bing-boom.,"One word: Ka-boom. One of the best action-packed games I've ever had the honor of playing all my 31 years of living. This is the Grand Theft Auto III of first-person shooter. Even though it lacks the depth and time-amount of Deus Ex, or the intelligence level of Black Thorn, this is still the king of mindless shooting-fish-in-a-barrell action that Soldier of Fortune used to be. The only difference is the awesome graphics, gameplay, animation, sound, controls, and multiplayer."
2,eh...,"i bought this game shortly after it came out. i'm sitting here and i honestly can't even remember it. i have a great memory for video games, but i just can't remember a single level or mission parameter of this game. i sold it soon after beating it. nothing that great aside from the locational damage and the great character models. other than that, this game really was nothing great."
2,"Eh,its not sll thst good",I really think that this game should have had better graphics. There are many glitches which often occur- such as people disapperaing in thin air. Maybe its just my computer(Pent3) but i think that this game could have been a lot better.
3,Not too bad... patch is a must,"a pretty decent sequel to the previous hit. The most attractive aspect of the original game was to me the damage model where individual parts can be blown off and internal organs exposed. The new version however has improved on the idea by making the level of damage and dismemberment dependent upon the type of weapon used and the body part affected. The disappointing factor is that the although the enemy AI has been ramped up, they seem to possess some sort of body armor that makes them resistant to fire. Also the visible damage is a lot less although more accurately positioned. I like the ability to random generate missions which should give the game long term playability. There is also an extensive selection of multiplayer skins from terrorist, to combatant to tie wearing computer geeks. I have yet to play online as I am still addicted to Delta Force Land Warrior."
1,"Ridiculously Hard,,","Even at the medium level, the enemy can shoot you, but you can't shoot them! Thew game is virtually impossible to efeat.After 3 levels, I threw the CD in the trash, and I will NEVER buy a game by this idiots again.Plus, the save feature is idiotic. You have to waste a save to start your game at the same level.Complete idiots wrote this game."
5,"Soldier Of Fortune 2, The Next Great Game","Soldier of Fortune was a great game that added many new features to the first person shooter genre. Soldier of Fortune 2: Double Helix looks like it will be even better than the first one. Using the Quake 3 engine this game has very beautiful, highly detailed graphics. It will have many new weapons and some old favorites. You will also be able to combine weapons, for example, an Uzi and a Pistol or two pistols. This game will also ship with four multiplayer modes and tons of maps to play them on. It should also have a very good single player campaighn as well. With great graphics, new weapons, awesome single and multiplayer modes, Soldier Of Fortune 2:Double Helix is definitly a game to watch for."
2,good....but far from great,"i found some elements of this game good, and some bad. i was impressed by the weapons selection (the knife was awesome) and the graphics, but the overall game play was kinda rotten.pros:great graphicsawesome weaponsgood storylinecool death animationscons:horrible melee combat'sluggish' gameplayhard controlsoverall, i would not recommend this game, as there are many better games out there."
5,This Game Rocks,"I thought this game was a blast. It took me about a week to complete it on medium setting. I loved the graphics and had a great time playing it. The multiplayer interface is a little clunky and could have been designed a little better but overall, an excellent game. Well worth the wait............"
4,"Good , but could've been great","SOF 2 is a fantastic game, though a bit buggy in places especially for the Quake 3 engine. The storyline is solid with graphics 100 times better than the first game, though a bit sluggish in spots. The main problem with this game however, was the horrible A.I. One look at the ever repeating roll and shoot pattern of the enemy troops and you had them the rest of the game. You would think that A.I. in games would improve with time, but not yet. The only game that has had decent A.I. in the last few years is Half-Life, which still easily holds it's place as the best SP and MP FPS of all time. Even after 4-5 years no game has yet to come close to Half-Life."
4,Excellent...If you've got the rig!,"SOF2...While the graphics have been spoken of in a less than favorable tone, I feel that, sadly , those people are due for a processor, motherboard and video card upgrade if they want impressive graphics. The default settings lean to the side of performance (speed). Slightly better graphics may be attainable with some adjustment of the detail settings. Graphics look as good (or better) than MOH2,RTCW. They should, same engine. Gameplay is great if you like gore, and plenty of it. Sound is unbelievable on a SB Audigy w/EAX. Get the rig first...then get the game!!"
5,Love his water colours,"Had owned a copy of this book a dozen years ago, and had misplaced it. Because I do water colours myself I wanted another copy. The Prince is a good artist and also a 'green' minded person, long before 'green' became popular. The only downside of the book is there are paintings he has done outside of the country, that were of no interest to me. Do so hope he does another book of his paintings geared more to gardening and other English themes."
2,Only Because They Were Painted by Prince Charles,"The paintings did not impress me and the paintings were a bit muddy for watercolors and their luminosity, but it was interesting to see what Prince Charles does and what he has to say about how he did it and what went on that day. I love watercolors but was not too impressed by this book except that it was written by Prince Charles and displays his artwork which was interesting from that standpoint."
2,"DISAPPOINTING, AT BEST","I must disagree with those who gave such rave reviews on this volume by Prince Charles, although I am an ardent admirer of him, his intelligence, his passion for things he believes in, and his love of England. Of the countless really good works published by artists depicting scenes of England, Wales and Scotland, as well as other countries visited and painted by Prince Charles, this volume does not meet the standards nor the beauty one would expect of an artist attempting to capture the beauty of those exceptional places. Prince Charles's watercolors are muddy, his work uninspiring, their value meaningful only in that they were painted by Prince Charles. I was quite disappointed with this book and with Prince Charles's attempts to create watercolors with any true value or meaning."
4,It works well.,"I wanted a low profile cover that was easy to roll up and this does the trick. However, it allows water to pool in pockets when it rains or snows and during the winter this causes chunks of ice to form."
3,Pete always lost,"I've used DirectRoute for several months now. It usually works, but I can't trust it completely. I entered the address of my hotel, saved it as a waypoint, and it led me there. The next day, I wanted to return from a different location, and it directed me to a different location a few streets away. I've experienced this type of event several times. I was in a newer track in Arizona a few weeks ago and the street names were wrong. So, it is not always reliable, but it usually gets me within a mile. It appears that I can only put one map on the SD card. The message indicates that my Meridian Gold doesn't allow more than one map, even if there is room. This is unfortunate because I would like to have several small maps of the West coast on the SD card instead of blocking a single large rectangle."
2,Beware copy protection on Magellan software,"Magellan uses a crippled CD for their copy protection and you must have this CD in the drive to load their software. Some CD drives have difficulty reading the defect; mine spun up so fast that the disk came loose from the spindle and crashed on the platform, scratching it and making it unusable. The worst part is that Magellan has taken the viewpoint that any problems with their copy protection scheme are your fault, and charge $25 to replace the CD."
1,Not User Friendly,"I have attempted to install maps twice, been unsuccessful both times. Too many steps and technical know-how are required. The directions and prompts assume a level of proficiency beyond the handheld GPS user who simply wants to proceed with a minimum of fuss. Another problem is having to use a Windows-based machine. Those of us who primarily use MACS would greatly appreciate a version for us."
1,Waste of time!,"Very difficult to understand the directions, once I did get a street route mapped it would not upload to the device. Got an error message telling me the GPS unit I have is not compatable with the software (it is a magellan unit). No help for this in the HELP section and the Meridian site requires several pages of personal info to even register for support. So after $500 worth of equipment, I am still getting lost. You are much better off asking directions on the way."
5,Works exactly as advertised,"I like this product. It works perfectly on my laptop, and the routes generated are reasonable. I am especially happy that the street maps have been updated, all of the streets/highways that seemed to be mis-digited in the old mapsend software in my area seem to now be corrected! I have had no problems with the copy protection noted in other reviews."
2,unfriendly copy protection,"This map software is fairly easy to use, and I have found the maps to be accurate so far. My only real complaint is the copy protection scheme that requires the original product data disk to be in the CD-drive in order to start the software. This subjects the disk to a lot of wear and tear with frequent use. No backup is provided nor allowed. If you use an ultraportable laptop with external CD-drive, this is an extra hassle when you try to travel light."
1,Magellan MapSend DirectRoute,"Many thanks for those that tested the water for me! I will save my money, thank you. I wanted higher accuracy (not there), desktop and laptop usability (not allowed), use on a computer that only has a CD burner (heaven forbid), and fast user support (fixes available in 3-6 months). I have let software engineers 'go' when they produce garbage. I thought that the internet bubble burst made a lot of good programmers available. Perhaps they are selling their souls generating automatic spamware email bots to flood our in baskets!Magellan - Wise Up: Make your money by 'selling' updates for, say, $10 + S/H, available bi-yearly. You can nickle and dime the dollars out of us honest but cost sensitive and perfomance mandating individuals out here."
4,Cobra microTALK / GMRS 2-Way Radios,"A good price deal; at least 20 percent lower than in major discount stores.The ""up to 12 Mile Range"" is a real ""caveat emptor"", i.e., ""buyer beware"". This range must have been achieved only under the most optimum conditions; maybe over water or in a flat grain field in Kansas.In any case, it does serve its purpose. The rechargeable standard AAA-size NiMH batteries are much better than the battery backs."
2,OUTDATED....,"The illustrations are not really usable, the pictures are dated there's nothing about water testing equipment etc. The systems described are in vague terms with little or no details. If you are looking for a good book on hydroponics for the beginner my advice would be to look elsewhere."
2,Complicated Description,This was a bit complicated. It makes Hydroponics sound very difficult and in actuallity it isn't. Would be nice to get a book that tells us inside gardeners simple instructions on how to grow hydroponicly and get really great results.
5,Excellent guide,This is an excellent guide for hydroponic production both commercial and home garden.
4,Greatest Cube title yet.,"The game is one of the best games ever. This because it has a very Zelda-like qay ofplaying it, and Zelda is also a great game! However, you feel the difference between Zelda and Star Fox Adventures. Eventhough the game takes place on land, the fact that there are missions inside the Arwing make you feel it is still Star Fox, despite of what anyone might say. The story is pretty original,and the graphics as well a sound are impresive! This game is great, a real jaw-dropping game. Highly recommended..."
3,another zelda game?,"this was a pretty good game except, its more like a n64 zelda game than a star fox one. clasic block pushing puzzles and the combat is to easy. once you register a hit on your opponent it is practicly dead already. great for those adveture types but if your looking for old school starfox, you wont find it here."
4,hard but fun,"starfox adventures is fun but also very hard. their are many levels to go through, but most the levels aren't that hard. the one level that a can't pass is that stupid little but strong dinosaur."
3,dissapionting,"I heard there was a starfox game. When I played it, it turned out to be NOTHING like the N64 game that was soooo good.Although the graphics are good, the gameplay is decent.3 stars from me"
3,"Well, sequels are really never that great...","This game is really fun but the only way that it's the same is you have the same characters and you spend about 1/30 of the time you play in your ship. This game has great graphics and effects and awsome diolouge, but it really isn't anything like it's little brother, Star Fox 64. Which adds an extremely intresting twist but, you space shooting gamers are gonna get your hopes up. So this is my conclusion: Nintendo, get a clue! Sequels are supposed to be different, but not as different as this game. So the main reason I chose 4 stars is because I'm one of those space gamers, except a lot more picky. So maybe you should rent it first, but this is an okay gameProsAwsome Battle ModesVery Different, having to start out from scratch kinda gives you a challengeConsVery easy to beat after 10 minutesNot anything like Star Fox 64 (which is very annoying)"
5,The best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game has the best graphics of any gamecube game and the gameplay is superb!Everything about it is great! The voices are awesome and the charecters are cool to!!!!!! If you want a great game then get this one! You wont be disappointed, I prommise!"
4,Pretty Good Game. Tries Something new and Succeds.,"Starfox Adventures tried a new approach, a Action RPG like the Zelda series. The graphics are good, the game is good, but there is only one problem. Why waste money on this when you can buy games like Windwaker and 4 Swords, which are basiclly the same thing but better. If you really want some good Starfox buy Starfox: Assault. If your looking for a long, intresting, fun, and slightly frustrating game this is for you."
2,2 Words...,"To Short. I beat this game in A weekend. I thought it would be more challenging and longer. Like most people said its like Zelda But Much easier and alot shorter. I like Zelda games so I thought this would be cool, the graphics are awsome but like I said TO SHORT!!!"
4,Star Fox,If you like adventure and action this the game for you. I rented it and I got hooked I beat 35% of the game in five days. I have it know but that doesnt matter. This game also has the best graphics and scenierios. The sound effects and music are awesome too. If you like zelda and the old star fox you will love this game. This game also puzzles you have to solve they're hard but fun. So if you like action and like adventure this is the game for you.
2,Boring as a box of undead monkeys,"Well, Ok I had fun with the undead monkeys, but not with this game. I was expecting more arwing flying action and better fighting control. The game is just too easy. All you have to do to defeat an enemy is press the A button. Wow, I can press the A button, you can press the a button, your toddler can press the A button. So, all and all kind of boring. But I think this could be a great game for kids. I think I'll get back to my undead monkees now...."
4,Read This Before You Purchase,"Now I cannot deny that this game has graphics that are so good they just define the awesome capabilites of the Gamecube but there is one thing that really bothered me about the game. In this game Fox is very stuck on himself and seems to think he is God's gift to everything. He is extremely selfish and is only saving Dinosaur Planet because if he does he gets tons of money. He doesn't care about anyone else (unless you consider him having the hotts for the girl fox chick ""caring"") and loves bringing glory to himself by doing heroic things. He has no love for the other Starfox team members and treats Peppy like he is inferior to him. It's very sad to see Nintendo has reduced Fox McCloud to this. If you are a person who is a lover of the good in our world you will find this game very distasteful."
5,great game,im very satisfied with this produce.it was a tiny bit scratched but it works great. i would recommend this to anyone.
3,Decent,"Star Fox Adventures is a decent game. Decent. It doesn't feel like an actual Star Fox at all (probably because it actually WASN'T at first). The voices of the characters get super annoying (ESPECIALLY your sidekick, Tricky). The gameplay is solid, though, and the melee moments with the staff are a good concept. Wish you got Fox's blaster, and I wish there were more space levels. But, the overall feel, and the voices, and the story, are only pretty decent. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Love this game!,"It is a very simple game to play, but it is one of my favorites. I love star fox and this is one of the easier games to play."
3,Rare this game is not,"I've enjoyed many a Rare game over the years. While this game is enjoyable, it feels like Rare is on autopilot. Great controls, great graphics, fun premise, but not a game I will look back and recall too fondly. This game was meant to be a Nintendo 64 game and perhaps that's the problem. It feels just like all their other 64 titles: DK and Banjo-Tooie in particular. These platformers were a lot of fun to play then but now I feel they need to raise the bar the way Insomniac did with Ratchet and Clank and Naughty Dog did with Jak and Daxter or anything Nintendo does. Maybe the change of scene over at Microsoft will help them reignite the creativity that many have copied (including themselves now) but few have duplicated."
4,StarFox for GameCube .....Oh No!!!,I can't believe that Nintendo threw away the main reason the Starfox series was such a success... the flying and fighting. I think that they tried to take the success of Starfox 64 and that of Zelda 64 and meld the two together to insure a top seller. Well ok good I hope they make a zillion dollars but I still want to fly and fight which is what made the prior Starfox games great. Nintendo got scared with xbox and ps2 on the market so they tried to unload all their ammunition with this title. Now unless they come up with new innovative ideas they have no ammunition. They lost confidence in themselves and I hope this doesn't mean the start of a downward trend for them. Now what will they give us for Zelda in GameCube that we have not already seen. They should give us a StarFox II for the gamecube that continues with the flying and fighting! They forget the old saying .........IF IT AINT BROKEN DON'T FIX IT!!!
3,Disappointed,"When I heard about Star Fox Adventures coming out for the Gamecube, my first thoughts were ""cool a fighter game for the GBC."" Then Rare instead made it RPG-style, and my hopes fell. As I played the game my hopes fell even more. To put it plain and simple Star Fox Adventures is sometimes BORING and Nauseating. Tpuzzles in the game doesn't require a lot of thinking and after beating the game you'll find it has no real replay value. However the game did have very vivid graphics and sound qualities. The bosses looked cool and SFA did have some fighter piloting. Still the game isn't worth the price tag. I recommend renting it or borrowing it from a friend like i did."
2,This is not a Five Star Game!,"Please do not listen to the five star reviews of this game. It has all the graphics you'd expect from a AAA Nintendo title and absolutely none of the fun. The levels sereously seem like chores. Artisticly this game is amazing, but the game design is very, very boring. If you are looking for a fun new Nintendo style game I highly recommend you check out truly fun games like Pikmin, Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker, or Mario Sunshine. I'd even choose Luigi's Mansion over this game. It seems like Rare has forgotten how to make fun games. Do yourself a favor and rent this game before you buy it."
4,It's a really good game!,"I really like the Zelda adventure type games like they made SF Adventures. I am not that crazy about the soot them all up in space type games like they made the other SF games. They did a really good job making it like Zelda! The bottom line is,If you like adventure games and RPG games you will love SF Adventures!"
2,Star Fox is not worth your while.,"Where do I start. This game, in my opinion, is a big disappointment. The only good things about this game are the detailed graphics and simple gameplay. This game reminds me of a super cheesy version of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (*****) and it just isn't Star Fox.When I put the disk into my Gamecube I was expecting the same kind of exitement that I got from Star Fox 64. I had been decieved. THERE IS ALMOST NO FLYING IN THIS GAME WHATSOEVER, SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL STAR FOX YOU WON'T FIND IT HERE. Another thing it reminds me of is a violent version of ""The Lion King.""This game was just plain stupid and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Terrible game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The missions are really boaring!!! i got it yesterday, now i want to re-sell it!!!!!!! STARFOX is not like this! i love starfox but when this game came out i hated it! it would have been better if krystal was saved in space. when STARFOX assault came out i loved it!!! i give it 5 stars *****. The publisher Rare should have not published it. IN other words Namco is the best!!!! i hope the next one is better than star fox assault.I heard on TV it missed its goals. it missed its goals by 100000!!!!!!!! The voice of starfox sucked and slippy's voice was terrible!!!! Don't buy this game!!!"
1,this game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLLAYED IN MY LIFE. bESIDES FANTASY STAR ONLINE.YOU PLAY THIS GAME FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THINK,WHY THE(BLEEP)DID I ORDER THIS HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good but not the starfox I know,im not saying that this is a bad game but it surprised me I thought that there would be more flying instead this is sort of like legend of zelda. I like how they tried to take the game in a new direction but it didnt cut it for me I loved star fox 64 in fact it was the first video game I ever played so I hope that star fox comand will have more flying in it than this one. on the plus side this game had a good storyline that made it hard enoughto not beat it in an hour heres how I rate itgameplay: B+graphics: Acontrols A-fun A-overall B As I said there is not enough flying in this game so I dont rate it too high this game can also get frustrating at really hard parts and it can get boring at some points but overall its a good game
2,"good for an hour, two if your patient","Few games can bore me past my patience level. I threw this game in, started playing, and i thought, pretty cool, shooting down flying ships from my flying dinosaur, wierd, but cool! Then i went on and found the gameplay EXTREMELY repetitive. Pick up barrel, throw it at bad guys, repeat until puzzle, then solve puzzle while throwing barrel at bad guys! If you look at my other reviews, im not much of a game cube fan, been sony for years, but i thought i would give this game a chance since all my friends won't stop talking about it. This game is great for about an hour then you get sleepy cuz its boring! The only game worth mentioning on the cube is metroid prime, so pick that up and have a blast!"
2,Simply not fun,"I had really high hopes for this game. However, after getting about 50% of the way through Starfox Adventures, I simply had to admit to myself that the game was boring. I've been entranced by Zelda, and I couldn't put my controller down when playing Eternal Darkness, but Starfox just doesn't do it. As has been said by many, the graphics are spectacular (though the use of character voices gets absolutely nauseating very quickly). Unfortunately this game proves the old adage that gameplay trumps graphical might every time.Younger children might enjoy this, but I honestly see no reason for an adult to pick it up. Try Eternal Darkness instead."
1,Very dumb,"This game is very silly and stupid, it's an insult to the Star Fox series. It's a Zelda clone with a star fox license sprinkled on it and with many gimmicks(Arwings, big dinosaurs, etc.). The gameplay is too easy and it is a waste of time. I don't suggest it to anyone."
3,"good for the young ones, boring for me","first, where were the arwings? second, why make up a language so you have to read subtitles when the gamecube can achieve lifelike spoken words? in short, the game was fun for all of 30 minutes. the makers of this game obviously had children in mind when they produced this title. as for me, give me metroid or give me death."
3,Not as fun as it looks.,I like almost all of Rare's nintendo games. I was looking forward to this one. I bought it the day that it came out. I was exited because the game has really good graphics and it was made by Rare. Yes the graphics are well done but the game is boring. Your always looking for stuff you don't want to look for because it isn't very interesting. I like Zelda because it is interesting and it keeps you wanting to play more. But this game is not too innteresting. It is very easy at some parts. Even if you like Rare's past games I would suggest renting it first.
2,an annoying game,"i got this a wile ago and dont like playing it at all.the game plain sucks.the only good thing is the perfect graphics.the worst part is half the time you dont know what to do or where to gothe characters are annoying,especially their ""dino"" languageif you are four years old this game will be fun to stare at.if you are 20 years old this game will be a pain to beat, and will be a huge waste of timedont buy this game...unless you want to burn 20 bucks.by the way im not a ""kid"" i just didnt wanna sign in."
2,If it went important to the story of fox it be in the trash!,This game suck i mean come on u dont even get a guun if it werent for the fact that a sequal to this game is comeing out i throw it away stay away to hard not fun stupid story thers hardly any flying stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,OVER RATED,"THIS GAME HAS BEEN THE TALK FOR SERVAL WEEKS NOW. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A NICE DEMO ON IT AT E3. I WAS ABLE SEE BOTH 3RD PERSON COMBAT AND THE STARSHIP. THE STARSHIP WAS WELL DONE REALLY NICE GRAPHICS, IT IS COMPARED TO A ROUGE SQUADREN IT HAS WEAK BACKROUND GRAPHICS BUT VERY AMAZINGLY DEATILED STARSHIPS. NOW WHERE THE MOST ACTION IS AT IS THE 3RD PERSON VIEW. THE GRAPHICS ARE EXCATLY LIKE ZELDA 64 WHICH IS NOT SO GREAT WITH THE POWER OF GAMECUBE. FOX HAS NEAT MARTIAL ART MOVES BUT THERE ARE FEW OF THEM.THIS GAME SEEMS TO BE ""OK"". THIS IS OVER E3 DEMOS AND VIDEOS.""FROM E3 THE BEST GAMES WERE METRIOD, RESIDENT EVIL ZERO, DMC2"
4,Good stuff!,"It's a shame I could not give a 4.5 stars. This game is an epic of Zelda like proportions. Fox flies around in his ship (like Star Fox 64, but not quite as good) and also solves puzzles on the ground with the help of a dinosaur named Tricky. RAREWARE the development team, is one of the best ever. The only flaws are the puzzles do become annoying, the camera angle is somtimes icky (a lot of readjusting with the L button), and the battles between Fox and enemies are too simple (only one enemy in a group of six attacks at a time, while the other five do a little dance around Fox.)"
2,Star Fox for GameCube,"This game is pretty good for fans of Zelda.Star Fox fans will be dissapionted to see that Falco is only in it at the end and the rest of the Charecters don't really do anything.Fox has a stupid magical staff that can shoot fire,ice,and make Earthquakes.Defeting enamies with the staff is much to easy,all you do is press A.Also the Arwing(thats Fox's space ship)levels are really easy.Also I think the part where Andross comes back is very stupid.How could Andross ""revive"" himselfif he was already dead???I think this game is to easy and will not please Star Fox fans(I myself am a huge one), but it will please Zelda fans.I can't wait for the Star Fox ""shooter"" to come out."
1,Why enjoyed the original star fox games!,"Just from the review I have to give it only 1 star! First off they are trying to turn it into a zelda of sorts. Secondly, where is Falco? Star Fox is more than just one person! Its a team effort between Fox, Falco, Peppy and Slippy! I will not buy this game because there are too many fighting games on the market and I dont feel we need another! They should have stuck with what was working and what made Star Fox, Star Fox!Star Fox was the only real Space game Nintendo had and now that is gone!I own both the original Star Fox from the super Nintendo and the Star Fox from 64 and I can tell you that they most likely ruined Star fox 4-ever."
2,Star Fox,"This game looks extremely good though it will be very different being made by rare and most of it on land oposed to the normal plane type. I expect it to be a little like donkey, and banjo games, because of the fact that it's about animals, and made by rare. On another note even though it has not yet been realesed NAmco has anounced a 2003 Japenese realese for the next one, which will be another plane format as i hear."
3,IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO LEGEND OF ZELDA,People say this game is alot like legend of zelda but its barley like it the only way its like it is that you can roll cant jump and you sometimes you have to shoot your flame blaster throgh the flame at the right color to advance and and after you vist a area <excecpt for Thorntail Hollow> there is no reason to come back and another thing is that there is only two real bosses the others are just on the jet bike which is fun but easy and there is not very many puzzle thinking and at the end after you beat the final boss <which i wont say the name> you cant do anything else you have to erase your file to do to do anything i would have gave it five stars if there were things to do after the game like side quests but if i were you id stick with starfox 64 its much more fun.
5,I LOVE this game!!!,I tried this game in a store and couldn't get my hands off it.It's so much fun.P.S. Krystal rules
4,the best game ever,star fox deserves a five star rating and best game award.It is so fun I have to play it at my neighbor's house cause she hase gamecube I do not please please please tell the compony that makes star fox to make the game for playstation2 please.
2,A bad game,This game is not for anyone over 13. It is a button masher and does not require any strategy. It tries to mimic Zelda too much and it made it into a bad game.
5,EXCELLENT game to play on the ( Nintendo GameCube ),"StarFox Adventure: Dinosaur Planet is a EXCELLENT game to play on the ( ( Nintendo GameCube ))I give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY WORTH TO BUY and play this game on your Nintendo GameCubeI see the demo on Starfox Adventure: Dinosaur Plant at Video Game retailer stores it have EXCELLENT GRAPHICS on this game made by: Nintendo"
2,greatest graphics on any system but..............,Star Fox Adeventures has the best graphics on any system but.....this just isn't Star Fox's best game in fact the game itself is pretty lame. Rare should have made this a first-person shooter it might have held my interest a little longer. I have already quit playing this game but that might be because i just bought animal crossing and it's getting all my playtime right know. But that no excuse a great game will force you to play it and this game just doesn't do that. Nintendo should have made Star Fox themselves instead of giving the license to RARE!!!! I'm afraid that Fox McCloud and the Star Fox Team has been offically killed after this game. too bad after the great SNES and N64 games. Farewell Fox!!!
4,One last RARE game for the Gamecube.,"This being the first and last Rare game for the gamecube, i was hoping that it would be good, and i was not let down. Let me just first say that Star Fox has the best graphics this side of resident evil (also for the gamecube) and it is a lovely game. The sound is topnotch adding to the varied gameplay reminscent of Zelda for the 64. The adventure aspects are very involving and will keep you into the game, I defiantly recomend this game to anyone, it is just plain good."
3,ehh,"Not as vanilla-y as I had gotten used to with general mills, and more cappuccino-y. Depends on what you are used to drinking, I guess."
1,Too bitter!!,"I purchased this in spite of prior customer reviews that said this drink was not sweet. I found it to be horrible tasting. It is much too bitter to drink, even with adding sweetener. Unfortunately I am stuck with 6 cannisters of this lip curling brew that no one in my family will touch. Don't waste your money, try another brand if you want a sweet cappuccino because this is not sweet or tasty."
2,not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with the flavor of this cappucino. I tried adding more sweetener, more milk, changeing proportions, but never found a combination that I enjoyed."
1,bad news,"a worse-than-poor substitute for the overpriced similar General Foods product that Amazon abruptly stopped carrying(so has Shoprite, but -- persistence! -- Target still carries it.)"
2,Bad new for re-sale,"Orion certainly makes decent telescopes, but all prospective buyers should be warned: Orion won't do business with you if you've bought one of their scopes 2nd hand: they won't return calls, sell you parts, or anything else you might expect from a decent company. Why does that affect folks who are buying new from Orion? Well, if you want to sell your scope in order to upgrade, the buyer will be out of luck when it comes to getting parts, so he or she may be contacting you so that you can act as a go-between with Orion. In the end, that will affect the resale value of your scope. Let's hope Orion changes this absurd policy, but until they do, I'd look elsewhere for a scope."
2,Read other Baldwin books first.,"""If Beale Street Could Talk"" is probably the worst novel by this very important writer. Because Baldwin was so gifted, none of his books is a complete waste of time; the scenes here that are set in church are exquisitely detailed and evocative (Baldwin had no peers when it came to writing about the black church). But the novel is wildly uneven. One scene in particular, in which Fonny and Tish's two families confront each other, reads like a script from a very bad TV show. Also, as the book progresses, the narrator -- Tish -- sounds less and less like a 19-year-old girl and more and more like a certain famous black male writer. Those seeking an introduction to Baldwin's fiction should start with ""Go Tell It on the Mountain,"" ""Giovanni's Room,"" ""Another Country,"" or the vastly underrated ""Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone."""
3,This book is deep and has alot of meaning behind the title,"""If Beale street could talk"" this title kind of throws the story off but, the story within itself is interesting and full of intese emotion."

4,Street People,"James Baldwin is an premiere 20th century writer of literature at the highest level. The fact that he chose a theme which was very important at the time of his writing is admirable. Many people wish that he had not written his book, but many other of us are delighted that he did write it. Once your story is put to print no one can deny the existance of your being.It was very unusual for people of his time to take on the burden of writing about the embrassing topic of race discrimination. Thanks Baldwin for laying the way for the Civil Rights Movement which ostensible started in the 1960's. I hightly recommend this book ."
1,If Beale Street Could Talk,"I have not yet formulated an appropriate review however my intial thoughts on reading this book are as follows. Whoever does make that unfortunate decision to read this book will be greatly dissatisfied. Consider yourself lucky if you can read past the first 48 pages without being able to predict the book, or get fed up with its use of constant bathos and sentimentality. A formal review will be forthcoming in the next two weeks or so."
4,reminding me of.......,"this book took me back to the days of teenage love, and the struggles to understand everything around you at that age. Tish and Fonny's love story was very cute. I had an easy time picturing it. Fonny's time in jail was very well written. The ending touched me deeply, and was very sad. I am looking forward to reading many more of Baldwin's books."
4,James Baldwin is part of the standard.,I say this because if you are a lover of black male authors. James Baldwin is and should be at the top of your list. He brings so much passion and feelling in all his works. I love them all.
5,I Can't Believe I found This Book AGAIN!!!,"I have read this book years ago, and I never forgot it, I would go to different book stores and try to find it with no luck. A friend of me told me to look up a book on Amazon website, and I said let me check for If Beagle Street could talk was available, and IT WAS!!!! I was so happy to see it!!!!!!!"
4,good tech-house compilation,"I found this album by chance on Amazon and as a long time fan of tech house and most things electronic, I figured that it was worth the two bucks. Especially as Plastic City rarely disappoints and some of the artists were not ones that I was familiar with. Good grooves, not too housey, not too techno (not that I mind) it's great all around and fairly older so it still has some of the early quality that these genre's have lost and regained over the last the decade or so.If you like Terry Lee Brown Junior,Timewriter,detroit techno, acid house and electro stuff than this will cover all of that ground in one comp."
3,"Cute, funny, and sexy but what's all the fuss about?","I was so excited when I read the fabulous reviews for this book, only to be extremely dissapointed with its length!This book is a very small paperback romance, which lacks a true and deep character development.Nonetheless, the heroin-Eden-and hero-Ramsey- are endearing and the chemistry between them is extremely sexy and palpable. The whole storyline-about Eden's creative edge going through a stump due to her lack of sexual experience and then unexpectedly finding it back everytime she happens to see the handsome and charming Ramsey- is unique and quite unpredictable.The love story that gradually develops from their ""strictly sexual"" relationship is sweet.Other than that, I do not see where the glowing reviews were coming from because in the end this is a very short, fluffy, and sexy romance that you will finish reading in a couple of hours...."
3,"Good tunes, fun listening.","This debut album from Papas Fritas is good, but it is nothing too special. Catchy melodies and harmonies abound. ""Helioself"" and ""Buildings and Grounds"" are much better."
2,Fun but...,The description for these cards says packs from the 1980's-1990's. We did not receive even one pack from the 80s. All pack were from the 90s. Do not expect to get any great cards in these packs.
2,"Good, but not that good.","Cards from the 80' don't expect too many. I just got like three of them. the rest, 1992 and 1993. better than the cmpany I bought before,but still not what I was looking for."
1,80's and 90's cards,"Good if you want to get your kids into collecting, they were overproduced and they have no value so beating them up don't matter, otherwise if you buy these, pull out any Griffeys, and destroy the rest."
3,A Christmas Gift,I don't have anyway to rate these baseball cards; they were a Christmas gift to our middle-aged son who collects cards. those questions above not relevant for baseball cards. He did say these are common cards thus he wasn't interested in them. They did arrive in a timely manner and packaged as advertised.
4,Great Christmas Present for my grandsons.,Grandsons enjoyed opening-up each and every envelope of these ball cards on Christmas Day. I purchased plastic sleeves and a binders so they could store the cards for safe keeping.
5,great set,buy every year for my son. cards are mint and he loves going thru them. has found some valuable cards in the sets
4,naruto addiction !,"i don't know why but unless your rich, i don't think you should spend the money on cards like anime."
4,Great 80's rock album,"If you are/were into 80's rock this is a pretty good one to have. I had the cassette and I have been waiting for a reissue or the price to drop. Anyone that heard this album know what I am talking about. It will be added to my collection soon... yes, soon, it will be mine again."
3,salty dog or salty mouth,"I was'nt too impress w/this one.It has it's similarities to the likesof greatwhite,only great white stands alone in comparrison.For theprice I just don't think it's worth it.If you want great rock,check outwildside it's way better for your money,It's a real gem.This cd is apetrified prune."
5,A remarkable work of profound exegesis,"The late Fr. Seraphim (Rose) has explained the significance of the relationship between God and man before the Fall, as well as the profound relationship between Genesis and Our Lord Jesus Christ. This is a must-read book. The updated 2011 edition features discussion in the light of contemporary views of evolution and creationism."
3,Good Practice Product,"I found this broadsword to be great for balance and speed. The spring steel created a great deal of flex towards the last 8"" of the blade leaving the impression the product truly is for Form study and competition only. (Don't try chopping anything with it)The nut and bolt construction of the handle allows it to be easily removed in order to modify ( stain & wrap) the handle for added grip and appearance.Overall I was happy with the product for the speed value in performing Forms, however I have switched to the Long Chuan broadsword for a heavier blade to work on strength."
2,"no ""coloured illustrations""!","Do not get caught by the title. There are no colored illustrations. It is a black and white reprint of the original book titled ""Mcian's Costumes of the Clans of Scotland: Seventy-Four Coloured Illustrations, with Descriptive Letterpress by James Logan"" which has these illustrations of clansmen in color."
5,Muscle Milk is Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is the best ever, trust me when I say this. I had Gastric by-pass surgery, so I have to drink alot of these kinds of shakes. This by far is the best,tasting smooth as silk. I just love it all the flavors are wonderful. The protein you get from it is wonderful. Try it is GREAT!!!!!!!! Amazon is great to deal with good prices and shipping is fast."
1,"Arsenic and Lead, I'm not kidding...",The new Consumer Reports (July 2010) reviewed this product. Notable levels of ARSENIC and LEAD. The makers of this drink should be ashamed. This stuff was supposed to be healthy.
5,Excellent Resource,"This is an excellent book for teachers, tutors, and parents who want to help their student grasp modern math concepts easily. The introduction includes a section on tutoring, as well as an overview of the skills that need to be mastered by the end of 5th grade. The format is easy to follow and enjoyable at the same time. Lots of fun activities and games keep interest high. Students love it! It is also a great home schooling resource."
2,"very, very basic info","There's not much to this. It is not worth the $9, even to someone who only needs a basic overview."
5,soap molds,"I ordered these for lotion bars. They are smaller than what I had anticipated, but the size works great for samples or as an assortment for more than one person as a gift."
1,Buyers Beware; Switch and Bait Seller,"I bought the 2 volume book set by John James Audubon The Birds of America and the seller sent me The Birds of America paperback book by Christies Auction House. When I contacted them of their error, they offered me the set I had ordered for almost double the original price I already paid them."
4,It's a fine game,"I'm not a rollerblader, but have always liked these games, but I encountered one main problem. I don't know some of the lingo in the game, and there aren't places to learn them, so it kept me guessing.The control is a bit off, and things move very fast. Otherwise, the worlds you skate in are intuitive long, and worth exploring. This is the game for bladers, and even non bladers to get."
5,A MUST HAVE 4 EVERYONE!!!,This game is really fun because it has all new music from some great bands and plenty of different parks so you'll never get bored! When you fall it shows little drops of blood but its not really gory its really quite funny! Go ahead and buy it!!
1,Cold food! Do not buy!,My husband works outdoors. I bought this container for him so he can eat a hot home made meal once in a while. What a surprise when he tried eating his soup! It was cold after only 4 hours in a temp of 34 DF outdoors. Do not but if you want to eat hot food!
1,Deceiving Manufacturer Description on this Product!!!,"Description says ""FULL line"" of American made products.. Received delivery and was the first thing I looked for...Made in China..enough said..I'm returning it.... Can't say if it's any good but I only buy USA made tools.."
3,The Curity nursing pads were very absorbent. I ...,"The Curity nursing pads were very absorbent. I especially liked the liner that keeps leaks from happening. The one disadvantage I found was the lack of contour of the pad to make it more comfortable. Overall, though, I was very impressed with the product."
3,I found these pads to be a bit ...,I found these pads to be a bit bulky. They showed through very clearly. I also didn't feel they kept me very dry. The different layers separated when they got wet.
4,TRACK LISTING,Disc: 11. Bro'ball2. No Ma'am3. Yes DearDisc: 21. Loose Ends2. Bloodcount3. Mr. Johnson's BluesDisc: 31. The Other2. What Are the Odds?
4,Good read but sad that they lost so many years,I enjoyed this book despite the bittersweet loss of 13 years between such obvious soul mates. Both the H and h were very likable and it was a really believable romance.
5,Je T'aime,"This book is very sexy and sensual. the characters have amazing chemistry, and the author describes them in a unique, almost tender way. i have almost all of lynne graham's books - i always fall in love with her leading men. i can always rely on them to be tall, dark, and mysterious - perfect in all ways."
5,Wrong Item,"I really can not say anyting bad about the product because I am unable to use it :) The product I received was for a motorola phone it looks like and not the Plantronics headset, but this is my fault because I should have sent the product back for the correct items, but it is more trouble than it is worth so just tossed them in the round file, and still do not have the correct charger cords LOL"
3,Real Brazilian electronica... from Brazil!,"This is a 2-CD collection of Brazilian electronica, from the Muquifo label. The first disc (""Organico"") is mellower stuff, while the second ""Sintetico"" disc is much more abrasive and clubby. If you want to hear what Brazilian electronic artists were up to, circa 2001, check this set out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Quide)"
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL HIT VERSION,"Guess what people! I just got this CD, and the version of ""Lean on Me"" here AIN'T THE ORIGINAL VERSION that went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1987... it's a REMAKE! And IT DOESN'T SOUND AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!What a disappointment! This is like playing the shell game... Now I wonder, WHICH CD has the ORIGINAL HIT RECORDING OF THIS SONG? Greatest HITS?!? Talk about deceptive advertising!"
1,Buyers Beware!!!,"Product is good however, totally overprice...Able to buy this exact same product at Target for $0.99 so I don't understand why would they sell this item at Amazon for $4.95."
4,There're so many similar products but this is ...,"There're so many similar products but this is one of the better ones. There are no worries about irritation and so it's good for those with sensitive skin. Although buying bulk baby wipes may be cheaper, these are small and can be placed in handbags or carried on you more easily. They're very soft on the skin and have no strong fragrant odors. I always have some with my first-aid kit. I find them especially helpful on those hot and humid days when you're out and about."
4,This towelette pack is very handy. The pouch ...,"This towelette pack is very handy. The pouch is resealable for future use. Personally, I'm a big fan of Wet Ones and our family uses them all the time. The towelettes are thick and nice. The aloe moisturizes and counteracts the effect of alcohol. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family. I'll buy them whenever I take a trip too."
2,Needs more illustrations and pictures,"Being from Paris and now living in the US, I looked forward to this book. I thought I would get a review of history and maybe find out new things. The history is OK but very slim in many instances. What disappointed me the most was that there were almost no pictures. It would have been fun, for example, to have both historical illustrations and modern pictures of an area being described in this book. Many things are described but it just is not the same as seeing it in pictures. Most illustrations were obscure and not explained within the context of the book.All in all, better to get two books - one on history and the other on architecture. Trying to do justice to both does not work."
3,OK Read,"Rambles along for 2/3rds of the book, then gets more interesting. I really didn't like the main character and his choices."
1,"very poor transfers ,you can find better copies at cheeper prices if you look","i was very disapointed in this set,i know that at cheep price you are going to lose quality, i have bought and reviewed a number of these multi-pack movies ,but these transfers were just the worst i have ever seen. 8 of the movies were unwatchable and when returned they gave me new set and same problem with same movie. even store couldn't get them to play sowatch and look else were for these films."
5,The listed price is wrong.,"I bought this DVD for eight dollars at a Best Buy in Chicago. That's the set retail price as far as I'm concerned. Forty dollars is definitely worth it for all the good movies on here, but any DVD retailer would likely sell it for under ten."
4,So far so good,I've only had this product for a few weeks but it has been REALLY COLD here and it's working fine.
2,Not very powerful,"Bought this item in January 2009 for a 24-inch, shallow-bowl, concrete bird bath. It would keep a circle about 15 inches across free of ice on the coldest mornings - but 2009 was a relatively mild winter here.This year (January 2010), we have had temperatures in the low- to mid- teens and the best it can do is an area about the size of the heater. Granted, this provides water for birds to drink but I have to wonder how it would perform in temperatures at or near zero.Bottom line, if you live in an area where winters are typically very cold, you may want to consider a more powerful unit."
1,Disappointment!,"Sadly, the birdbath heater failed miserably. I will be returning it. It worked perfectly until the temperature hit the freezing mark, then worked when the temperature got back in the 40's. Today it is in the 20's, and the water is so solid I can't get it out."
2,Not very good - might work in warmer climates,"I was very disappointed in this product. When the air temp got below about 20 degrees, it was all it could do just to keep a very small hole open in the water - mostly it was like crushed ice along the outline of the product itself. Our birdbath is only 18"" across (and 3"" deep) so I fully expected this to keep a majority of it open. In the end we pulled it off since it was using electricity and essentially doing nothing but making avian snow cones."
2,Failed after one winter,I've been using this bird bath de-icer for winter 2010-2011. It is only February and it has just failed. It could just barely keep a unfrozen patch in the shallow bird bath on the coldest (-10') days. And it has now given up the ghost entirely.
4,Works as advertised,"The ice eliminator maintained an open area of water in the birdbath down to zero degrees and probably would continue to work well below zero. The low wattage is an energy saving benefit. It is only warm to the touch, which makes it easy to handle to allow easy cleaning of the birdbath. The ice eliminator would benefit from a slightly longer cord so it could be plugged in and be a little less obvious."
3,It works minimally,"It has not been that cold yet (20's F for the past few weeks) but this device is struggling to keep even a circle with a diameter of 3"" open from ice. It was frozen solid when I first deployed this, and it did indeed melt the ice below the device, but then when it sunk into the bath, the water froze above it."
2,Not very powerfull and paint falls off,"I bought one of these back in Nov. 2004 and it just quit working which is pretty good. That said, I never liked it much. It only thaws a softball size area in the water in freezing weather. And the paint on the thing constantly flakes. Also the cover on the underside has a space between it and the element which traps all kinds of gook and is hard to clean out. If they made the bottom plate just snap on somehow instead of being screwed on you could remove it to clean it. Four stars for longevity, 2 for melting power and engineering."
2,weak,"We have only had weather in the 20's and 30's and the birdbath is still forming ice. when it gets to the single dig-gets it will be worthless. I wish I would have saved the packaging and the receipt, would have sent it back."
4,Bird bath de icer,"Ice eliminator is the appropriate description. It melts ice in a small circle around the piece in extremely cold weather.It took 5 days to melt into the frozen birdbath and has since kept that area melted, so it works as stated and I am happy with it. The price was right too. It allows the birds to drink and it looks enough like a rock itself that it is not scary to them.Update June 2012 - This product did not last very long, I ended up throwing it out this spring when it stopped melting the ice. It never did keep the whole thing melted but only a small patch around the piece."
4,Birdbath de-icer,"Product was shipped quickly and the item was exactly as described. The only problem I've found is that it only thaws a small area of my birdbath. However, I guess that's all the birds need at this time."
2,Barely worked,"This worked for a couple of weeks in this very mild winter, then when it got down into the 20's, it stopped working - solid block of ice in bird bath. I'm throwing it away, since we have no way of knowing if it's just ineffective, or if it has a wiring problem that could cause a short. (I would return it, but we didn't use it for several months after purchase, so it's too late.) Since we liked it while it worked, I would have given it more stars on the chance that this one was just a dud. But there are enough other reviews with similar problems that I felt this device might actually have too many problems."
5,Perfect for my fountain.,"I have a decorative fountain on the patio that serves both as a fountain and dog bowl. The dog bowl part was unintended, but what the heck. Every winter the fountain gets winterized until the spring. Sometimes the first frosts come early and I'm not ready to pack up the fountain for the year. This birdbath de-icer allowed me to go in to December with out the fountain freezing up."
2,Worked well for two years at temps down to 15F. then failed,"The heater worked well initially and kept ice from forming in a 16 inch birdbath down to moderately low temperatures. The design is good, made with a heavy, painted ,solid, cast metal housing (probably zinc) with all components potted or encapsulated. No part of the unit appears corroded or damaged after two years of use. This year it has stopped working and I am waiting to see if K&H will honor their 3 year limited warranty on their well made, well designed product. I suspect that either the temperature sensing switch or the heating element has failed open circuit and there is no way to access them. I thought it was good value and may give them another try. It was just the right height for robins to rest on mid-bath!"
2,Lasted One Season,"We had this last winter, and it stopped working before spring. When it worked itwas was fine in our NJ winters."
1,Didn't Work Entire Season,"I purchased one of these products 2 years ago. It worked fine the first year although it was a pretty mild winter. The second year it quit working early in the season and I bought another one just like it as it was the only thing locally I could find and I hated to see the birds go without water. The second one did not work at all when we put it out this winter. I thought the first one was just a fluke, but obviously I was wrong. Our experience has been that this is a disposable product."
4,Bird Bath Heater Performance,"This heater does a very good job of keeping the water clear of ice. However the water must be shallow enough (not much deeper that the heater is thick)to work well. When the water is shallow it does work very well. The cord is extremely short for our application and I would think that would be the case for most applications. We had to purchase an additional short, outdoors extension cord. I think the cord on the heater is about 18 inches long. It would be much better if it were at least 36 inches long."
3,good product,Good Product to about 15 degrees. Lower than 15 degrees should use a more powerful warmer. Would recommend this product to others.
5,Makes my backyard birds happy!,"Perfect for the few cold snaps we have in Memphis. This year, we've had snow and temps in the single digits a few times, but the water in the birdbath has remained unfrozen, and my birds and squirrels love it. I can't speak for extended, super-cold winters, but it's worked great here."
4,Bird bath heater,"This heater is a replacement for a different brand. I have been using this heater for four months and it has been effective down to -2 degrees. It also uses less energy than my previous heater, which is another plus."
4,could be better,"It works really great !!! Problem is , it does not have enough wattage to really clear a big patch ---ice forms all around and just leaves a small hole --- the animals find it, but they have to get on the ice around the hole to drink, bathe.If the ice is soft they bathe whether they planned to or not !!! lol a good product, but needs a bit more watts to keep it ice free when the temps go in the single numbers, (and sometimes in the lo teens depending on the wind )"
2,"If You Live in Midwest, FORGET this one","I had this heater placed in a shallow metal birdbath, it barely works at all. The one ""cold""(temps just below 30 degrees) night we have had so far it kept just a small circle of water clear. I am returning it to get a more powerful heater. I think this one might be ok if you live in an area where it doesn't get too cold, but I cant see it performing at all in our below zero conditions which are coming up."
2,Worked great over two winters,"On the coldest winter days in NJ, it would keep an area of open water, not thaw the whole birdbath, which is fine. The birds find the spot OK. Near the end of last winter, I had to keep filling the bath more frequently than normal. I discovered that the thermostat was stuck on and the thing was hot and cooking the water, even on a mild day. It sports a 3 year warranty sticker, but is past the Amazon return period, having bought it in Dec 2010. Not sure I will go thru the mfgr's warranty hassle, paying freight both ways and probably getting a measly partial refund for a $30 product."
3,Cold weather review,Works great down to 10 degrees. After that the open water area decreases significantly. Will find out this week if below zero freezes it out completely.
4,Works great! Very Happy Birds!,The first one I received at Christmas stopped working. The manufacturer and Amazon were very helpful in exchanging the product. It really does work well and keeps a water source for the wildlife.
5,Bird bath heater,works great very impressed with this product will recomend to all my bird lovers friends. also was a good price.
5,The birds love it!,"The birds like to get fresh water all year long, and with the cold Massachusetts winters, this bird bath heater keeps the water from freezing on even the coldest days!"
2,SO-SO book,"Very general knowledge, not worth buying because you can get same info over the internet, and even more. I would not recommend this book!"
4,Perfect book for the complete newbie!,"I found the presentation and format of this book provided a good, quick, and easy read. Simple diagrams and explanations address those questions you feel too dumb to ask but probably should ask.It is a book I find myself coming back to re-reading items after I have tried them out on the water.This is the book to buy for sit-on-top newbies."
3,A very basic book.,"This book would be good for someone who has never even seen, much less paddled, a kayak. Otherwise, anyone who has been out 1 or 2 times will find this book a bit thin on content. I would recommend ""Sit-On-Top Kayaking"" by Dennis Stuhaug as a better, more comprehensive beginner's book."
5,Neo Lounge with Heart,"A lot of mid-90's releases that jumped on the retro-lounge bandwagon were either just aping a style for the irony or...just jumping on the bandwagon to make a buck. Not so Jim Ruiz. He really loves this kind of music, has totally absorbed it, and will sing its virtues to anyone who will listen, including all the friends and family he has convinced to be in his band. He has also used this musical style as a vehicle for some very impressive, heartfelt songs and performances on this release and the much more varied, better-recorded follow-up, Sniff. Both are fantastic, but if I had to pick one it would be this one."
5,"Best book on the market, detailed, thorough and complete.","Anyone who is interested in the career of a financial planner should consider Nancy Langdon's book the most complete resource. She covers every aspect of the career--the good and the bad. This book isn't what you'd expect, it tells the truth.What I like most about the book is the ""sensitive financial planning"" ethic and how financial planners differ from brokers.This book sees the career of financial planning exactly as it is...you will be able to assess financial institutions for what they really are rather than relying on just their marketing tactics when deciding on which company is best for you.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in financial planning--no other book comes close!"
3,Good Information at a Basic Level,This book provides a large amount of information at a faily basic level. The information provided was useful. The book gives a broad overview of the industry and provides guidance for those considering a career in financial planning. Use this book as a starting point if you are considering a financial planning career.
2,Lacked content,The book was not as clear as it could have been and did not offer much new. I found the added comments scattered through out the book from others to be frustrating. The author failed to provide the nuts and bolts in a format needed to become a financial planner. She should have taken the opportunity to get down and dirty with her own experiences and shared those experiences with the reader. For someone interested in becoming a financial planner I would suggest they look at some of the other books available where you can obtain more information as save some money. I also thought the price was nto appropriate for the content.
2,over priced,"The book was weak and lacked original ideas or helpful hints. Further, I thought the paperback book was way over priced. The author failed miserably in the area of marketing. One of the most important components in a financial planning practice is the type of business you are doing, she provided very little information in that area, and what was provided was short and appeared to have been copied from the regulations and thus was not as clear as it could have been. I did enjoy the references to the email addresses she provided throughout the book, but also, very quickly I got tired of the frequent contributions from other she included in the book.I have not read any of the other books on the subject, but I would recommend exploring the others before attempting this book."
3,Good Cheerleader... but that's about it.,"I get the feeling that the author is a fun person who absolutely loves her job, loves writing about her job, and loves knowing that others out there want to be financial planners. The advice, however, is pretty bland. This would probably be a good book for someone who has not done a lot of research about financial planning but has expressed an interest in it (perhaps a high school or college student). For someone who actually is in the process of starting a financial planning job/career, they probably already know 95% of the stuff in this book. There are nuggets of information here and there, but for the most part, it's a feel-good about financial planning kind of book. If you want specific, in depth details about how to get started, I would recommend Rattiner's ""Getting Started in Financial Planning"" instead."
2,"Overpriced, Underinformed","There are much better choices out there, this is basic information that is way over priced.As a previous reader noted, all of the positive reviews were written on Sept. 9, 2003. For that reason alone I would not purchase this book. Buyer Beware!"
1,"outdated, disgusting planted reviews","First of all, this book is already way outdated. A few years ago it could have helped you, but now things have changed quite a lot. Try Jeffrey Rattiner's updated ""Getting Started"" book (2005 edition) if you are interested in becoming a financial planner and make a decent living managing other people's money. As an ex-planner let me offer this advice: it's a lot of hard work, very competitive, and no guarantee you'll make a lot of money. Plus, you really have to be the extroverted type to like this kind of job, i.e., a lot of kissing up to your clients (what else?).The 5-star reviews from Sept. 8 and 9, 2003 are obviously planted reviews, as so many others have pointed out. Really disgusting behavior."
5,"Shocking, fearless look into the world of the legal system","This newly released book (with an excellent forward written by Christopher Darden ( remember the O. J. trial? )) details injustices in the world of women and children within the context of our legal system. The tangled mazes and webs of the ""justice system"" are untangled for those first entering the often biased ""halls of justice"" in an easy to comprehend eyeopener by author, Karen Winner. When will enough ""injustice"" be enough? The author not only identifies problems but offers solutions to some, as well. There is even an accompanying website, kwinner@divorcedfromjustice.co"
4,Iteresting,This book was written amazingly.The describtions brought the book alive.For any sci-fi fan I recommend this book.
2,Very disappointing,"At first it seemed quite good. It was attractive and optical. The Microban thing was a plus, considering what happened to my last mouse.It immediately, however, proved to be far overpriced for its worth. Right after installing it, I noticed the cursor would slightly stutter. It was veering on its own to the left, despite however I was actually moving it.Now, after a little over a week of use, one of the buttons broke after barely a tap (and I'm a very dainty girl, mind you). It stopped being clickable, and when I investigated, the button fell into its hole and into the mouse itself. Now the button's somewhere inside there, refusing to be shaken out, and I can see all the glowing red doohickeys inside.Bottomline: Do not buy ths mouse."
1,This looks so LAME,I think that inline is so lame. If you want to see a REAL skating game get Tony Hawk 3.
2,Pointless wordplay,"The author of this book is not a native english speaker. As a result, his writing is fresh, lacking cliche'. Unfortunately, he seems to take a little too much delight in just putting words together, without making that wordplay serve his story. An unusual description of someone's hat is entertaining by itself, but if the person's hat has no importance for the story, it's just a distraction. If you have attention deficit disorder, you'll never get through this book, since it constantly diverts you to all manner of irrelevant things."
5,Stunning,"I was blown away by these stories - A Coin left me breathless, I haven't read such an impressive story about war since Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried. Islands was a beauty, with a truly disturbing layer of brutal politics and history lying underneath the tale of a family holiday. I could go on about all the stories but I don't want to give too much away. Hemon is a fantastic writer."
5,Carrots Love Tomatoes,Great information on what vegetables like to be planted with and which other vegetables and which herbs will benefit or adversely affect each vegetable. Lots of great information not available anywhere else.
4,tomatoes love carrots,"The seller of this book was very quick to send it and I received it in less than 10 days. My son and I had decided at the last minute to plant a garden, so by time we received it, we were already moving ahead with the project. However, it did arrive in time for us to get some good use out of it. We found information that we were not aware of, such as planting cucumbers with your corn to help discourage the raccoons, not planting our tomatoes near the potato patch, using herbs and flowers to protect certain other plants, and etc. The garden is in, now all we have to do is to watch, weed, water and wait to see how all this plays out. I am sure that most novice gardeners will find this book as interesting and useful as we have."
3,Helpful,"This book gave me most of what I was looking for, that is, what vegetables should be planted together to get the best growth and prevent pests. I was mainly interested in a vegetable garden and this book covers everything, flowers, shrubs and vegetables. Maybe the additional information will be useful at a later date"
5,a must have gardening book,"I have read these books at least three times and frequently refer to it for reference. I finally decided to let the library keep their copies when I found this ""two for one"" at a price better than one by itself. I'm thrilled to have them both super handy. Very practical gardening knowledge; a must have for any one who grows their own food."
5,A gentle re-minding,"For those who've been exposed to neuro-linguistic programming or simply those who've read some of the wisdoms of the ages, this compilation of deeply considered prose is exquisite. With his unmistakable accent and lilting voice Deepak Chopra speaks of the mystical paradoxes inherent in the human experience of creation. Ranging from the concept of how the world which I experience is ONLY my world by virtue of my sensorial 'hard-wiring' to the contrasts between an internal or external locus of control, this CD is like one of those well-thumbed books which one refers to again and again. And the added bonus is that not only is it an auditory delight, but the most exquisite nature photography accompanies all the readings for those who wish to access the multi-media track. It should be a must for all NLP practitioners, those wishing to explore the ideas of universal consciousness and anyone looking to experience the pure delight of age-old wisdom."
2,Transforming or Transformation?,"I presume this is pre - Madonna! Help. Nobody can even understand this cd. I tried to listen to it with the volume up and even up higher, but no luck. I could not understand the words. I think it is a good idea he met up with Madonna and others as in the cd, ""Gift of love"", because his life as a wanne be musician - singer is over. The music background by Franke is really pitiful and unchallenging. More like boring. Speaking english would really help and may be I could understand this transformation and the the real meaning of the cd.I am sorry that I purchased this cd without hearing it first at Amazon, now I am stuck with it."
4,"Light, funny read with a few pieces of wonderful wit","While the story itself isn't exactly outstanding, the book is quite interesting and well written. There are enough twists and turns to keep anyone occupied, and for the keen reader there are quite a few lovely pieces of wit spread throughout the book. One example - ""... of such monumental ugliness as to be magnificently impressive, like Chicago""."
4,No con...,"Hilarious, and a good mystery to boot.Too bad the Kindle edition is carp-full of tyypoos. Bad conversion, I guess. But it's 99% readable."
4,Comic relief,"If the government or the economy is getting you down, try a dose ofGod Save the Markby Donald Westlake. The hero is the mark who never met a scam he didn't like. He trusts everyone until it's just too late. When he inherits $300k from an uncle he never heard of, he summons his best defenses. Alas, this time the money is real. There are, however, a few strings attached, such as people who will do whatever is necessary to acquire the money, perhaps even killing him, if necessary.When I read Westlake's humorous mysteries, and this one is a good example, I usually get about 2-3 spp (smiles per page) and 1-2 gfc (guffaws per chapter). Your mileage may vary, but I'd suggest you give it a try."
4,Clean and Funny!,"I really enjoyed this book! The different cons were very entertaining (I might have fallen for some of them myself!). The writer has some great sentences that make you laugh at how clever the phrasing is. My favorite was when the character is repeatedly telling people that his near death experience ""Wasn't a big deal,"" thus ""overstating an understatement."""
2,less than stellar,"I started reading ""God Save the Mark"" by Donald Westlake last week and halfway through it I did an unusual thing: I gave up. I've probably read about twenty books by Westlake, but that was the first time I had ever stopped reading one before finishing. But less than a hundred pages into it, I realized that I just wasn't enjoying the book. In fact it was starting to really annoy me with silly plot twists. And the worse thing; it didn't have the same charm as Westlake's usual caper fare. Very far from ""classic Westlake"" in my opinion. I knew before starting this book that it wasn't part of his wonderful Dortmunder series, but even Westlake titles that aren't part of that series are usually very good. Not this one. But I won't hold it against the very talented Mr. Westlake: this book was written way back in 1967, presumably before he honed his style."
4,"Smallish and ugly, but does the job","Bought this hat for a cheap headcover for an African safari. It definitely did the job, but it's a bit small for a size M/L. I'd say it's closer to a S/M, or even just a Small. It still provided ample cover.It's also ugly, but I guess I can't really knock that since the pictures wouldn't for a moment suggest otherwise.Also, it's really ugly.... Like... really ugly."
4,basic quality head covering,"though quite bland in color, this is a great camping hat. Cool, shady, somewhat stylish. Kinda expensive for the large size but I'm glad I bought it. It can be dampened with cool water and act as an evaporative cooler when in the sun."
4,Red Promotes His Records,"This CD is a compilation of ""transcriptions"" produced to be played on the radio on two different radio programs that promoted Brunswick ""electric"" records. As such they contain great period announcing for each cut.Most recordings are expanded recordings of specific releases or medleys of popular tunes of the day, some of which Nichols never actually released on commercial records. Liner notes are complete and its easy to pick out Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Pee Wee Russell and so forth as they take their hot solos.These recordings are probably as close as you can get today to the way hot dance music was played in person. For example ""I May Be Wrong"" follows the release closely, but at a slower tempo until the vocal, at which time they break out into extended jazz solos at a faster tempo than the release.A quality CD showcasing Red's style of hot dance music and Brunswick's record marketing circa 1929-30."
5,Wedding scrap book,The wedding scrap book helps you keep your memories organized. It's very cute and helpful.
2,Crappy Scrapbook,Very disappointed in the contents of this book. There were no extra pages or any pockets for momentos. Wouldn't bother for half the price.
1,It's Lousy,"I purchased this product to deter my cat from scratching at doors and furniture. After repeated doses it does nothing. She still continues to scratch where I have sprayed. I wasted my money. It says it is guaranteed or my money back and I intend to return it. How can you rate something which is lousy, so in order to complete this form I had to indicate one star."
5,Greatly expands PowerPoint and also works with Excel,"If you do a lot of PowerPoint presentations this program will be your constant companion. It's a PowerPoint plug-in that provides the following capabilities:- auto-enhance slides and graphics, including beveling, anti aliasing (for sharper text), gradient fills, text kerning and better shadow effects.- slideshow timing controls and better annotation abilities- ability to manage slides more effectively: you can jump to any slide with a click, reorder slides quickly and have more transition and color scheme optionsThis application also works with Excel, and greatly shortens the time it takes to create a chart, as well as provide more control over the chart's appearance.The main value of this program is for the frequent presenter or the presentation developer. It will save time and quickly pay for itself if you develop or deliver more than a presentation a week."
5,A pretty good end to the series,"I waited for this book for over a year, and I have to say, it was pretty much worth it. ""Final Confrontation"" tells the story of Jesus' ministry on earth,along with his resurrection, from an angelic point of view. I found the view points of the various angels and demons quite interesting, especially during his birth and crucifiction.I did find a few grammatical errors in the book, but other then that, I would definitely give this book five stars. Although I wish that the series would not have ended witht his book, I think that the author, D. Brian Shafer, did a fantastic job in both his writing and accuracy. You've probably all ready read about the life of Jesus through our (a human's) viewpoint. I would reccommend reading this book, so you can see it through a spiritual one."
4,Bishop as Pawn,"""Bishop as Pawn"" is the 3rd Father Dowling mystery by Ralph McInerny. Billy Murkin appears at the St. Hillary's rectory in Fox River, Illinois. He is the husband of Marie Murkin, the rectory's housekeeper, even though she hasn't seen him in 15 years. Later that night he is found dead of a gunshot wound in the rectory. It becomes apparent to Father Dowling and his friend Phil Keegan, captain of the Fox River Police Department, that Murkin had been living in Fox River all along under the name of James Dunbar. Then, Bishop Arthur Rooney is kidnapped from the rectory where he is staying on church business. Father Dowling wonders if he may have been the target of both crimes since they both happened at the rectory. Are the murder of Billy Murkin and the kidnapping of the Bishop related? Father Dowling works with Phil Keegan in solving the crimes. As always in this series, all loose ends are tied up. ""Bishop as Pawn"" is a good read."
3,Sweet and touching~,"This was a very nice read. It tells of the link between mothers and their children that cannever truly be described. We ahve all heard the stories over the years of mothers who know when a child has come to harm or needs them in some way. This book chronicles stories such as these.As a mother of grown children, it made me smile. I passed it on to a young friend, and it made her cry.I would indeed suggest this one to a friend, if that friend has a child. There is really not esnough substance here to hold the interest of a casual reader."
3,5 Stars if I EVER got it...,"Like another Caleca buyer, I never got it. Ordered early Sept. and still not projected to ship till Jan 25. Really wanted it as it was lighter weight, beautiful, very chip resistant, Micro and Dish Washer safe.I ordered 3 sets and was going to order a 4th. Plus I ordered additional accessories such as serving plates, casserols...just about everything they had in this pattern.Very bummed. Perhaps it was not to be."
1,Rate an Item - or rate an item never delivered,"I would say that for the frustration of having these on order for 5 months and still not having received them, money would be better off spent elsewhere. They look to be beautiful, and folks who actually do have these plates attest to their quality....however, they are not worth waiting for 5+ months for.Look elsewhere."
3,Wish I had known . . .,"I bought 8 sets of this pattern the end of 2005. Yes, that's seven years ago I know, but the glaze in my coffee mugs has been mostly gone (digested?) for the past year or so. Between two people, only 2 or maybe 3 of the eight mugs get used every day. I have had cups in the past get stained but never lose the glaze like this. Wish I had known."
4,A different Kinky twist,"Kinky's ""Guide..."" is a bit of a twist for the author, speaking as someone who has read virtually everything he's ever written. I have to say, it's clever, features some very unusual pieces for the author, and as always, will have you laughing out every orafice."
4,Another Great Book By the Kinkster!,"Even though I'm not from Texas I found this book to be both funny and informative. Once again Kinky has penned yet another satirical classic that everyone should enjoy. Not a ""who-done-it"" but a hilarious look into The Lonestar State and what makes it great!"
2,Don't give it to a true Texan,"I bought three copies, two for gifts, one for myself. After I finished my copy I decided I couldn't give my Texan friends the books I bought for them. A little of the Kinkster goes a long way. True, he turns a funny phrase, and only Dennis Miller can beat him for arcane references. But true Texans would not be amused."
4,"Small and Compact / However, not really sure if it works.","The Zadro is small and folds closed like a small flip cell phone. It can easily fit in a pocket or your purse.The Zadro only has one button that you press and hold for about 10 seconds. The purple light will come on along with a Red LCD light to let you know that it's working.All you need to do is simply hold the light over an object like a phone, toilet seat, keyboard, etc for 10 seconds and the unit is supposed to kill all of the germs.Unfortuately, since I'm not a scientist, I really cannot tell if germs are being killed."
2,Disinfection Scanner uses limited,"You can buy this product, it will kill bacteria, germs, and some things, but not all things. This product is limited to certain things."
4,Energizing and inspiring,"Imagine an 'elderly person' who is homeless by choice, and works her way through her life, travelling the world like a backpacking student? Dicky Jensen is this person. She travels the world on a strict budget and travels alone by choice. Not back and forth to Florida but to Brazil, Czech Republic, and Ireland. This book is simply what seems to be a small portion of her fascinating experiences, and if ever a person answers the question of 'what have you given back to the world?', she is it! I had the great pleasure of meeting Dicky Jensen at a book promotion, and after finishing the book, I do feel that it doesn't do her complete justice. She is so engaging and interesting, and the places she has been and the people she has encountered is astounding. However, the book is an easy and cheerful read, full of inspiration to get out and do something with yourself. I think it's worth the time spent appreciating her fine and meaningful life!"
5,Life after kids! Homeless and happy!,"Every wonder what you'll do when you kids are gone, and you are divorced or your husband has passed away? You will be in charge of your own life and happiness.This is a must read! Dicky says don't whine and mope about how you can't afford this or that, how you wish you could travel but this or that stops you. Dicky, who no longer has a home to call her own travels to amazing places, meets engaging people by staying in hostels, and finds life fun and interesting.It's a quick and inspiring read!"
2,not worth the money,"I purchased two of these and within a few days, gave them away. They are flimsy and the pockets stretch. But more importantly, the little ties that Graco provides to hold the bottom down (so it doesn't flap around) came untied several time per day. The ties are just six inches long and had to be ties to the pocket of the seat in front. Bad system and, like I said, we promptly gave them away."
4,20 year user,"As a user of Zeasorb for the past 20 years, I works better than any other drying powder I tried before. It was recommended by my doctor for excessive sweeting and has helped. As for the warning label, I take in more Acrylamide in the french fries I eat."
1,Research the ingredients first,"When I received this product, I saw that a warning on the back reads: This product contains Acrylamide, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.Had I known this, I would not have ordered this product. It would be helpful if this warning could be included in the product description."
1,Contains carcinogens,"After I bought this, I read the back and was shocked to find this warning:WARNING: This product contains Acrylamide, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.They should disclose in the product description. I'm not going to proactively rub carcinogens on my body."
5,Not the one to miss,"For some reasons unknown, everytime I listen to this latest Mark Whitfield's live sets I always feel like I am listening to Grey Osby's ""Banned In New York"". Raw is quite different from what Mark Whitfield did in the past. As the title suggests, the music in there often gives you a sense of ""raw"" feeling which is missing in other Mark Whitfield's albums. He did well in what he accomplished thus far, and the direction he approaches in there definitely makes this live dates worth listening over and over again."
3,AIRSHOTS FROM LATE DECEMBER 1934,"This CD is an expanded version of airshots released on a London LP HMG-5023, probably in the Radio Years series. It features broadcasts from late 1928 by a big band fronted by Joe Venuti. The complete line-up is unknown, but it included Louis Prima (trumpet & vocals), Jerry Colonna (trombone), Larry Binyon (tenor sax & flute), Frank Victor (guitar), Fulton McGrath or Joe White (piano), Neil Marshall (drums) and Red Norvo (xylophone).In addition to a number of jazz standards, Venuti also reprised some of the numbers like ""Wild Cat"" and ""Running Ragged"" which he'd laid down first with his musical soulmate Eddie Lang, who had died the previous year. There's an affectionate liner note by the late Richard M. Sudhalter, who makes the point that these were live performances, in the sense that there was no second chance. Sound quality is somewhat muffled, but worth tolerating for the quality of the performances."
5,Fun & creative,"I bought both ""Conveyor Company Start Set"" & ""Power Chute Start Set"" together for my 10 years old son for the Christmas. I had first seen the demo of Rokenbok in the store when my son was 3. He wasn't that interested then but earlier this year changed. He had both them setup in the Christmas Day and started to play. Quickly I have joined with him to modify and connected both sets into one. Now we need to buy more parts to build the factory even bigger. I don't recall how many ""thanks Dad!"" he has said since the day he opened the boxes.This set is not as fun as ""Conveyor Company Start Set"". But I used this set to get the stuff I want. Additional controller pad, RC Skip Track vehicle would cost near the whole set. And I got building parts and spare control center."
4,Just a great movie,"Several emotions wrapped up in one fine movie. Sad, happy, wasrm hearted, funny. Just a great movie with exceptional acting. An enjoyable film for anyone..."
3,Please Read the Book,"Before you watch this movie..., please read the novel. I have never in my lifetime read a book that changed my life the way this one did (with the exception of To Kill a Mockingbird) Now that I have said that..., to the movie.The acting and casting were superb. I was glad that I watched the movie. I was on a high from reading the novel and went out to rent the movie right after. I was disappointed..., but most movies don't own up to what the book portrays anyway(with the exception of To Kill a Mockingbird). Anyway, don't hesitate to rent this, but not before you stay online here and buy a copy of ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" by John Irving. Simon Birch may have been a decent guy, but he was no match for the real Simon (Owen Meany)!"
5,"This movie will make you laugh and cry :) :""(","Simon Birch was a fabulous movie! I laughed and cried throughout the movie. The CUTIE-PUTIE, Joseph Mazzello, gave a spectacular performance, as well as Ian Michael Smith as Simon. These two made a perfect two-some and hope to see them acting together again."
4,"An Offbeat, Crude, Warm, Interesting, Satisfying Film!","""Simon Birch"" is unlike any movie I've seen before. It's about frindship, being different, overcoming obstacles, and trying to discern God's purpose in our lives in the midst of a seemingly chaotic, random, and often cruel world. Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, & Oliver Platt all give memorable performances. I also appreciated Jim Carrey's work. Highly recommended."
4,Heartwarming,"Reba and I loved this movie. Although we are miles away from each other, the tenderness and heart-felt sympathies of this film unites us ever closer....Someday I hope we may be able to watch it together...I have faith, too, Simon!!"
5,The Most Beautiful Films,"This was quite possibly one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen! I am a tremendous John Irving fan but that did not prevent me from getting lost in the world of Simon Birch. Mark Steven Johnson has created a story filled with richness, emotion, and beauty--you know, the kind they don't make anymore? My only request would be that the DVD have more additional materials as I would love to know much more about the making of this fine film. Ashely Judd has never been better than she is here. And Oliver Platt has never been as charming. I have seen this movie with my two daughters now three times. And every time they ask again to watch this amazing story."
2,"Plot bad, actors good","Joe Wentworth's best childhood friend was a dwarf named Simon Birch, who was convinced God had a special plan for his life. When Joe's mom Rebecca is killed at a baseball game, it's up to Simon to help Joe figure out who his father is (Rebecca never told of the father's identity). I give five stars for the Oscar-deserving actors, but I take away three stars for the sooooooooooooooo predictable plot."
1,Very Disappointed,"This movie is such a disappointment compared to the book A Prayer For Owen Meany by John Irving. True some parts would be difficult to portray on the screen, but a better job could have been done to bring this novel to life. Read the book and don't bother with the movie. The book is amazing from the first page to the last. Already seen the movie? Read the book! you will enjoy it so much more. This is truly the best book I've ever read and I encourage everyone to read it. It is defintely a classic."
3,A fantastic novel...a so-so movie,"My review is not so much about the movie and whether it's good or bad (it's nothing special), but a response to the person who said that the book that it's (sort of) based on, ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" by John Irving, isnt that great a book. On the contrary, ""Meany"" is one of the best novels by one of the greatest authors of the last 50 years."
4,SURPRISINGLY PLEASURABLE,"Shame this movie wasn't properly marketed, as it's a fun and enjoyable movie which I've enjoyed watching several times. The 12-year-old dwarf, Simon Birch, makes you laugh and feel that frog in your throat. Also, the scenery in this movie is splendid. (Congratulations to whomever was responsible for finding the location for this movie.)I would've given 5 stars, but some profanity and sexual innuendos take away from what should've been a 5-star movie. And it's just like Hollywood to make a movie that would appeal to kids, and taint it. That aside, it isn't often you'll find a movie that'll hit every emotion.Have a box of Kleenex by your side before you hit the play button.This movie is a definite buy."
2,MUSH,"...A Prayer For Owen Meany was a transcendental experience as anovel. Yes, this movie needs to be taken on its own terms as aseparate entity, and in doing so, it is a decidedly mixed bag. The character of Simon Birch rips your heart out not because of the weak and soppy screenplay, but because the small actor playing him is so frail looking and sad as a human being. This movie is shameless in its use of him, and successfully garners some lumps in the throat as the movie soppily explores one of the least interesting episodes from the novel. The character of Joe is given way too much emphasis in this version; everything seems calculated and designed to pull your heartstrings. Though there are a few genuine laughs (which come directly from John Irving's skewed life-view as set in the novel), this movie lambasts you with way too much autumnal color and weepy, bombastic music swelling on the soundtrack. Forgettable. END"
4,A real tear-jerker,"I watched this movie on a suggestion from my wife. Actually, I bought it for her for Christmas. It was a very tender story and a real tear-jerker. Not one that I would watch repeatedly, but a good family movie for a rainy day."
3,big courage comes in a small package,"Here a first friendship has a real impact on the life of a boy, Joe.Simon is a boy who is born small and thought not to live long.The events of this movie are about the ""bastard"" Joe, his best friendthe freakishly small Simon and finding out who his father is.Along thew way two very important people in his life die:one by accident and the other from an courageous act.Simon raises the problem of ""purpose"" and God's plan for us all.For the religious this may be a very inspiring film, but it just might gives some young people the wrong ideasabout how it is all right to actand question authority. The film is funny and very heart warming,and overall, well acted."
5,Simon Birch,this is one of the best movies that I have seen. I had the video but wanted to get the dvd and what a great price.
5,Great Movie!,"Simon Birch is a wonderful movie that will make you giggle in delight and cry. Overall, it's a wonderful movie and highly recommended."
1,overrated,This movie takes a great story (A Prayer for Owen Meany) and turns it into a horrible cliched melodrama. I recomend you read the wonderful John Irving novel instead of subjecting yourself to this virtually meaningless desecration.
2,"Hamfisted, manipulative twaddle","On the strength of so many positive reviews, I took a look at ""Simon Birch"". In brief, it is a play-the-cards-you're-dealt story, besotted with new-age apologetics. Religious fluff and hamfisted directing ruined what could have been a fair - if hackneyed - tale of courage. I find it hard to believe this story emerged from John Irving's (""The World According to Garp"", ""The Cider House Rules"") word processor. Thus until I read the original story, I'll blame director Mark Steven Johnson for producing an adolescent interpretation."
1,Unbelieveable,"Like most of the people who read the book first, I think this movie could not have sucked more. It sucked, sucked, SUCKED. If you have ever read the book, save yourself the trouble. If you've never read the book, well, read the book. This movie sucks."
2,Forced...,"I'm one of the people who have read A Prayer for Owen Meany before seeing this movie. As soon as I saw the credit, ""SUGGESTED by a novel by John Irving,"" I knew I was in trouble. This is obvious, as there is no character named ""Simon Birch"" in the book. Is it a good adaptation of the book? No. But it is unfair to judge a movie only in comparison to its source-material. Does it stand on its own? Well...NO! Holy cow, does this film NOT know what it wants to be. It tries to be sentimental and farcical at the same time. The jokes are ""punched-up"" by the dopey music on the soundtrack. It falls into a category of desperately sentimental, middle-brow, coming-of-age-in-a-small-town movies. It's the type of film a sewing circle might label ""nice.""Perhaps I'm being too hard on it. The film isn't awful - it's just not that good. The insult is that it was based on such a wonderful novel. Too many moments ring false and are forced for me to recommend it."
1,Owen Meany beats Simon Birch's anyday,"If you have ever read A Prayer for Owen Meany you would agree that this is the worst movie to ever come out of Hollywood. The movie leaves out many scenes that are vital to the story. It follows the story line very poorly and changes the ending. Don't waste your time, read the book instead."
2,A travesty of the book,"If you have read ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" you will not like this film. It is the loosest adaptation of a book idea I have ever seen. Entire circumstances are different and it is very unfaithful to the book. VERY disappointing film."
5,Simon Birch,"Simon Birch is a great movie, I never get tired of watching this. It is a great story with some great actors, and Ian Micheal Smith does a wonderful job as Simon."
5,A must see,"The first time I saw this movie i was stayin at a friends house. I thought it was gonna be another one of those boring movies with no point to it. So i was not happy about watchin it. But soon enough,i was both laughin and cryin all at the same time. Simon Birch was small in size, but had a huge heart. He believed that God had a plan for him, n his goal was to find out what it was. After watchin this movie, i actually believe that God has a plan for all of us, and findin out wat it is, is one of the many challenges we will come across in life. This is definatly a must see movie. Although, there was one little thing that I thought was kinda stupid. How Simon's best friends mother dies. Watch the movie and maybe you'll agree with me."
5,Heartwarming,"I really enjoyed this movie. Though the story is not built around Christmas, it has a Christmas play in it so it has become a Seasonal favorite of mine. I wouldn't classify this as a kid's movie even though the main characters are pre-teens. Don't expect to see much of Jim Carey. He's the narrator and doesn't show up until the very end of the story. I thought it was really cute and got a lot of mileage out of it. But in all fairness, two of my friends, who apparently are not given to inspirational-type stories, didn't like it -- which surprised me. They can write their own reviews. :>) In the meantime, occasionally,I want to disconnect by pulling this off the shelf and watching it -- even though it's not Christmas."
5,Simon Birch is a must see.,"Simon Birch is a movie that has you laughing one minute and crying the next. Each of the movie's individual characters adds something to the film, including the small role by Jim Carrey. Everyone should see this tearjerker at least once..."
3,If you've not read the book it's great.,The movie's great until you compare it to the book. The movie missed out a huge portion of the book and the ending of the movie was nowhere near as powerful as the book. But i enjoyed the movie despite this and i would watch it again.
5,Best movie in years!!!,"I loved this movie. Yes, it's a tear-jerker, but what's wrong with that? I think it's terrible that it had such a short run in the movies. A lot of people missed out on a GREAT movie. Critics (and the American public) are always complaining about the excessive amount of sex and violence in movies today, yet they ignore a wonderful movie like this-I don't get it. This is a great movie that everyone should see-I know I will be watching it over and over."
4,Very heart warming and meaningful!,"Even though there was some swearing in this movie, I felt it safe for my 8 year old to watch. Realizing that everyone was put here on earth for a purupose and had something to do while here, made the whole movie excting and truly meaningful! Two friends from oppoisite side of the ""tracks"" can be the truest of best friends."
1,Please stop ruining my life,"Buck this stupid movie.No, really, buck it.That this Hallmark piece of crap could possibly have been inspired by the truly great novel ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" is beyond comprehension. This turd of a movie is about as far from a faithful adaptation of a book as I have ever seen. It's Bonfire of the Vanities bad, and that adaptation was so wrong they wrote a great book about just how and why it went so wrong (it's called The Devil's Candy, and it's well worth a read). Somebody should give this movie the same treatment. How on earth did this movie (barely) manage to get released? It is that bad.Buck Oliver Platt. And buck Ashley Judd, too.I trust you understand what I'm saying."
3,Really Touching Movie yet plot was so so.,I enjoyed this movie but had to stop it and start it. Its not a movie I could sit through. The plot was ok. Some parts of the movie were interesting and other times boring. I thought the movie gave a good message and boy did I cry! There's a lot of twists and turns in the movie. It gets one thinking. But I felt the directors and actors could of used better language. To much cursing and sexual comments.
4,A film that beckons to be seen over and over again.,"My family and I were curious about this one after seeing promo ads on another video we had rented - so we rented Simon Birch as part of a family video night together. Although we were put off by some of the language at first (and had to apologize to our six year old who was watching it with us), we were all moved to tears through many scenes. Little Simon knew all along he was a hero and he proved it too. We recommend this film highly. We will be buying a DVD of it to keep in our own film library."
5,This is one of the top five movies I've ever seen.,"It shows that what we are inside and what we make of ourselves is the important thing. I can't recall any other movie that has made me both laugh and cry as this one did. I viewed this movie with a group of co-workers of varying ages and we all loved it. Now, several months later, I still smile when I think of it"
5,VERY SWEET AND MOVING MOTION PICTURE!!,"IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SIMON BIRCH, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SEE IT. THIS MOVIE IS QUITE HARD TO DISLIKE. IT IS ALSO QUITE HARD TO FORGET. IF YOU ENJOY GOOD DRAMAS WITH A LITTLE HUMOR MIXED IN, THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!THE TWO LEAD ACTORS GIVE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES!"
5,One of the absolute best movies I've ever seen!!!,"A movie has to be full of love, drama, excitement, adventure and so many other things to land in ""My personal top 5"" movies and when I saw Simon Birch the other night for the first time that's where it landed. Ian Michael Smith is an absolutely endearing boy who leaps from the screen right into your heart and deserves an Oscar of his own for this performance. The storyline is exceptional, the writing is well done, the actors who portrayed Miss Wentworth, Simon, Joe, Ben Goodrich and all others were chosen to a ""T"". If you have not had the opportunity to see this movie and want to see something heartwarming and special...something that will touch your heart and make you laugh and cry and smile...this is a *MUST* movie to see. Will be in my home library as soon as the price is affordable!"
3,"Too many cliches, right down to the predictable ""cough""","Saying anything negative about ""Simon Birch"" is like being against motherhood and apple pie; it's a sweet, positive movie that would be good for kids over 8 years old to watch (the ""rough"" language isn't anything 8 y.o.'s haven't heard before.) While I enjoyed the actors and the cinematography tremendously, the script was filled with too many cliches to give the movie real emotional impact. Predictablity is the death of good cinema and ""Simon Birch"" is about as predictable as they come. I'd recommend the widescreen version because of the location shots and the DVD transfer was good with no technical hiccups."
5,Best movie message in a long time..,"I found this movie halfway over on t.v. one day, and it was so compelling that I had to buy it for my family. It has a wonderful lesson to teach: God has a special plan for all of us and we don't even have to know what it is, for when the time comes to complete your mission, God will have already trained you for the task.I forced my family to watch this on a family movie night, and at the end everyone was glad I'd bought it. The actors are great, the story is full of humor, tragedy, and mystery. But mostly, it's about Simon, the boy who is different, who told everyone that he was going to be a hero and finally proved himself."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I saw Simon Birch many years ago and remembered it again after reading ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"". This is a humorous and enjoyable film. The acting is good - especially the boy who plays Simon- and the story is inspiring. It might not be appropriate for children under 12 due to some of the references to breasts and other body parts that would not be an unusual exchange between two twelve year old kids. I would recommend this film."
5,The best child acting I've seen in a long while!,"Joe Mazzello acting as Joe was displaying the same amazing talent as he did in Jurassic Park and The Cure and Ian Michael Smith preformed perfectly as the dwarf Simon Birch! An amazing, spiritual film. I still don't understand why the critics hated it so mch. Maybe they're all non-religious! Who knows. But this film is an awesome A+!!"
1,SIMON BIRCH,THE FIRST ONE WE RECEIVED IN A SHORT TIME BUT THE SOUND WAS NOT GOOD SO I NOTIFIED AMAZON AND THEY TOOK CARE OF THE MATTER PROMPTLY AND WE HAD A NEW ONE IN 2 DAYS WHICH WAS PERFECT. MY HUSBAND WAS VERY HAPPY.
2,Pointless,"The film is reduced to drivel, cliché, and melodrama to tug our heartstrings into submission...October Sky MUCH better."
1,BOOO....BOOOO....where is my refund?,"I went to see this atrocity in the theater and I am still waiting for my refund. Mark Steven Johnson vandalized John Irving's classic novel and created a film which plays to cheap emotion and nostalgia. This is just a warning to all film viewers (and, especially, fans of Irving), avoid this movie like the plague!"
1,An insult to a fabulous book,"Owen Meany is one of my absolute favorite books. Seeing this movie left me stunned. How could anyone destroy John Irving's wonderful story? Other than a few individual scenes, this movie has none of the spirit, power, or story of the book. Consider that Irving wanted his name completely removed from this project and that should tell you something about the quality of this film."
2,"""DUMBING DOWN"" OF JOHN IRVING'S ORIGINAL TEXT","This movie is basically a ""dumbing-down"" of John Irving's book. The story line was simplified so much, that for me, all meaning was lost. The book is wonderfully engaging and complex while the movie is a one-dimensional interpretation of the original text. I find this ""pirating"" of an author's work to be infuriating. Making a movie is not just about representing a story, this movie would have been better if it had captured some of John Irving's magic and irony and focused less on making the story fit neatly into a two hour package."
1,Like a Lifetime Television Movie Minus the Commercials,"Every scene in this movie was stretched out as long as possible in order to turn what could have been a 30 minute show into a full length movie. A walk from a porch to a car, for instance, takes the viewer on every single step... inside, I was screaming ""get to the car already!!!""Here's the plot. Kid has one friend with a sweet mother. Mother dies. Kid becomes hero saving many lives, but dies. The end.It was just that story stretched into an hour and a half. I was SO glad I had a scene skip button and didn't waste my money on this at a theater.Yeah... go ahead and say ""you missed the point."" Tell me ""it was an inspiring movie."" I get your point... and I don't disagree... it's just that it wasn't much of a story. I've seen WAY MORE plot in a 30-minute episode of Twilight Zone, and this thing just took too long!"
5,A good buy,Before buying these I used to use my nails to try and pry split rings open - and bust a lot of nails. These work great - I'm just mad that I didn't buy these 10 years ago !!!!
5,Excellent Tool,"I am very pleased with the quality and ease of use of this tool. I will never again struggle to open another split ring. I purchased tool to open 9 mm split rings, opens rings with no problem."
5,Love the fragrance. It was lightly scented and ...,Love the fragrance. It was lightly scented and it left my skin silky and smooth.
4,"I've used this product for years, and was ...","I've used this product for years, and was very happy to have an opportunity to write a review on it. Due to allergies and asthma, I've had to be very selective of the powders I use. Johnson's seems to be the least irritating of all I've tried. It smells great, is absorbent, and silky on my skin. I would've given it a five-star rating, but the amount of talc that drifts into the air is still slightly too much in my opinion. Hope they can improve on that, but otherwise, this is a first-rate product!"
3,Just so so,"This is a transitional book in the series, but I was disappointed because the emotions do not connect in this sequel. There is limited action and too much misunderstanding and mistrust. I really liked Lara in Warprize, but she is not nearly as likable in this book. Keir is also only a shadow of the strong character portrayed previously. I hope the next book will be more on the level with Warprize."
3,Not as good...,"The first novel in this triology was solid gold, but the sequel didn't rank a bronze.The plot is long-- action sparse-- and for a herbalist/healer she really didn't look for obvious clues to aid in treating the plague. Characters we grew to love are killed off for little or no purpose...and the love affair that was so deep and touching is now whittled down to nil.I was dejected at how different this novel was from the last--the characters flattened, the deaths non-sensical and the subplot of treachery in the ranks minimalized to tom foolery.I was counting the days until this sequel hit the shelves, all I can say is I hope the final installment returns to its roots."
5,The Fairy Tale Continues...,"Lara, the Warprize, is journeying with the Firelander Warlord Keir and his people through her land. Lara is now the Queen of Xy. They come upon a village battling plague. Keir tells Lara to not take care of the sick, but as a healer, she is compelled to help. She is also their queen. She is such a beautiful and noble woman. The plague spreads among the People of the Plains while she frantically seeks a cure. Keir and Lara are thinking about having children in the midst of all the chaos. During the sickness, Keir's leadership is threatened by a rival warlord. The rival's threat is averted, but more problems are coming. In the third book of the trilogy, it can be assumed, those problems will become quite ugly."
5,Second Book Was Worth The Wait!,"I have been eagerly awaiting the second installment to Lara and Keir's story. Vaughn has created a richly detailed world that you won't want to leave. I loved Lara all the more because she's an imperfect heroine. She makes mistakes and pays dearly for them, as does her Warlord. The secondary characters will grab at your heart. Tragedy strikes in this book and its heartwrenching but Lara and Keir fall more deeply in love and are learning what a true commitment requires. Warprize was a keeper and is pathetically creased and dog-eared from many happy re-reads. I have no doubt my copy of Warsworn will end up in just the same condition. The last entry in this terrific, inventive and moving series is Warlord coming in 2007. If I had my way, this series would continue to a dozen books."
1,Warsworn. not impressive,"I really enjoyed her first book, Warprize. However, I just couldn't force myself to finish this book. I got really tired of everyone getting sick one at a time and wondered when things were going to move on. When I found myself more than half way through the book and nothing going anywhere, I just gave up. I guess I will never learn how it ends"
3,Let Down!,"I was very disappointed in this book. In the first one(warprize) Lara was such a strong women. In this one she was stupid. Not only that because of her stupidity she got characters you loved in the first book killed. I was so not happy about that fact. The strong passion between her and Keir just wasn't their. That saddened me. Every page I turned I was hoping it was the last. If you want to read the trilogy all I have to tell you is get the kleenex's out and hope for the end, but it does give you some imformation for the next book. I don't think I will write her off yet, she is just starting out."
3,Interesting but not riveting,"3.5/5.0This second in a trilogy continues the wonderful story of the warlord Keir and his warprize, Xylara. The story is just as well written as the first, The topic of fighting the plague just wasn't nearly as riveting a subject as others would have been. Still, it has me captivated enough to dive into the third book!"
3,Okay middle to a great series,"This is the 2nd book in the Chronicles of the Warlands trilogy, and it's definitely a transitional book. I still liked it, but didn't feel it really moved the plot forward. The whole book focused on the plague and everyone getting sick and trying to treat them. I thought we'd see Lara really shine here using her healing skills and finding a cure, but she just didn't. She stumbled around almost figuring ""something"" out, but then never really does. This book fell flat, but I'd still recommend it as part of this series."
2,Not nearly as endearing as the first,"Vaughan takes a decidedly dark turn with WARSWORN, and it just doesn't fit after a very endearing and entertaining WARPRIZE. I don't believe the novel successfully enmeshes the continued romance between Lara & Keir in the midst of a plague which kills thousands.Also, the constant first-person vantage point started to wear in this novel. Just seems to limit the overall reading experience considerably, especially so in a dark novel like this one."
5,"The plot, and heat, thickens...","I truly enjoyed following Lara's growth as she breaks away from her homelands and travels with the sexy, strong, spicy Keir. [SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!] The plague as a vehicle to explore their heretofore idyllic relationship adds tension and heat to the story. As a suspense stretcher taking us from the formation of the Warprize/Warlord bond in book one to the, er, climax of the journey to the Heart of the Plains in book three, it serves very well in fleshing out the world, conflicts, tension, and their relationship.Read Elizabeth Vaughan; it's effortless, all-nighter, very entertaining reading that will have you as in love with the protagonists as they are with each other. Or, as I did, you will fall for Simus, the character that just leaps with virile booming humor right off the pages! RECOMMENDED for fantasy, romance, and ALL readers!"
3,pleasant continuation -- not a stand alone book,"""Warsworn"" picks up where ""Warprize"" left off. This novel relates the adventures of L--, a young lady in a medieval society who is a healer. L-- is married (sort of) to K--, a warleader from another country. This novel portrays L-- and K--'s journey to K--'s capital, which journey gets waylaid for quite awhile by a plague.This book was a pleasant read. The plot is a fantasy adventure, with a romantic sub-plot. The romantic plot takes a decided back-burner to L--'s adventure. The journey is the plot, so don't be annoyed when L-- and K-- stop for extended period of time. Alas, ""Warsworn"" is a sequel and suffers all of the usual flaws -- few unique worldbuilding surpises, and a rough plot that simply gets the characters from point A to point B. This is not a stand alone book, and suffers in comparison to ""Warprize"". Still, the plot holds together and left me wanting to read the next book.Overall, light entertainment suitable to pass the time"
1,A huge let down,"After reading Warpirze I ran out to a friend's house since she had it already. She sent me a word of warning, but I brushed it off thinking how could such a great beginning have such a bad sequel. I should have listened and now I'm in no right of mind to read the 3rd book.I might pick it up if my local library has it for loan, but I won't be running out to buy it."
4,"Enjoyable, but felt like filler","This book was well written and a good follow-up to Warprize. The story helps bring more understanding of Keir's people as they travel towards his homeland. But, they reach a village that shows signs of plague. Lara cannot resist to help. This introduces an illness that Keir's people have never seen. It brings hardships onto everyone and some devastating events that will bring tears to your eyes. But in the end, I felt like this book was more of a filler leading up to the third book. This book prepares the reader for the next book, Warlord."
4,Interesting and insightful,I have been reading this book with my husband couple weeks ago. We find this book interesting and insightful. We all have one of those event(s) we went through as a child that shapes our character as an adult today. Before I read this book just never think about it as much. I actually really looking forward to finish the book.
4,How we love,Product was fine but took an exceptionally long time to get it. Do not order from Amazon if you are on a timeline!
2,Shallow psycho-babble,"While some might find this book interesting, those who have studied relationship literature will find it more suitable to popular psychology and talk shows. It's emphasis on parental imprinting, childhood experiences, and emotional immaturity are old themes that allow adults to blame others for their lack of maturity and irresponsible behaviors. I wanted more depth, fresh ideas, new insights and instead got shallow themes, trite examples and elementary writing, and certainly not the ""revolutionary approach to deeper connections in marriage"" as advertised on the jacket."
5,How We Love,This book is an essential. I would not only recommend it to a married couple but also a single person. This book has given meAwareness and knowledge to things going on in me and my spouse.
5,great book for any couple,Clear and an easy read. Good examples and explanations for each of the styles. Will definitely make you think about yourself and spouse.
5,Heal and Enhance Your Marriage,"This book offers simple yet profound insights for improving the way you relate, and thus the way you and your spouse relate. The principles will help transform suffering relationships, and they will offer icing on the cake for thriving relationships. Milan and Kay offer you ways to change that are completely doable, and bring great results. The principles also apply to your other relationships. I love this book!"
4,So far so good,"It looks real nice and i have had some great moments with it after eating dairy products and tex-mex cuisine. only downside is the screw to tighten to bowl keeps coming loose. it may be a install problem, but i'm satisfied."
1,You get what you pay for!,This was a very foolish buy on my part. Toilet seat was for a bathroom that isn't used much so I didn't want to buy an expensive one. The package it came in was ripped and there was a horrible odor to the seat. I cleaned it several times and the odor did not leave...possibly this is the way a bamboo seat is supposed to smell? Gross! Whatever...it hit the garbage can and I made my way to the store to replace. This site does NOT allow for you to not provide at least one star for an item...so the one star is only so this will be allowed to be posted!
3,missing parts,"The seat itself was lovely, exactly as expected. It was obviously used or an attempt was made to install it. It came with original packaging but not in it. There were missing parts to assemble the seat to the toilet. I had to go out of my way to figure out what to use to attach the seat. I had to go to a hardware store to get the right fitting bolt, nuts and washers to use. I did manage to attach the seat to the toilet with some difficulty without the original screws, nuts or bolts. If the description described the missing parts I would not had been upset. The cost was cheap enough as a used item I may have still considered purchasing it with the ""knowledge"" of missing parts."
1,Do NOT buy this,"I ignored a warning on a review for this seat from someone saying the opening was too small for a man to use. Looks pretty, but totally impractical. I cannot fit all my parts over the hole, only one part at a time making it difficult to do number 2."
2,Its for children,"bamboo is great for standing up to moisture and it is substanable and resist germs better than the average material,BUT this thing is center diamater is too small for my husband and it would be sutable for a childrens bathroom except for the bump stops rise the seat too high off the porcelin for the little boys who can have a spray thru accident frequently"
1,Opening too small,"I unfortunately bought and installed two before I became aware of the issue. My husband and I both agree that the interior opening is too small. It's a struggle to word it delicately, but I have to slide backward or forward depending on which bodily function is occurring. It looks great, not cold to the touch, seems to be well constructed, but those things are not enough to outweigh the discomfort of every single use. I would return them if I could (and will buy replacements as soon as the budget allows)."
1,"""A Hole Too Small"" unusable . . . .","The seat is beautiful. The seat is unusable. The opening is only 9"" x 8"". The opening in the seat it is replacing is 10"" x 9"". I have visited the nearest store with my tape measure and found that none of the seats there have such a tiny opening. All the openings there for ""round"" toilets are AS large or LARGER than my original seat. This tiny opening may be adequate for a small child, tiny people, or your pet cat, but not an average ADULT. I wish that Amazon included this crucial measurement in the product description. I will need to return this - or use it for a picture frame. Very, very disappointed!!"
3,Color Is An Issue,"All wood products of course will vary in how they take a stain, but the seat I received is NOT dark. It's not blonde, but it's nowhere near as dark as the picture. I'd say it's closer to a maple color. It's a pretty color, but not dark.On the plus side, it seems to be well made. It takes a bit longer to install than other toilet seats because the nickle hinge is solid on the top side, so the screw has to be tightened entirely from the bottom. This means no dirt will collect inside the screw heads or hinge covers, because there are no screw heads or hinge covers. A nice touch."
3,"Attractive, but poorly constructed","The bamboo is lovely, and the color is rich and warm, but one of the plastic screws that goes through the toilet to secure the seat sheared off after a few months."
5,well made,This was very comfortable considering it was made of bamboo. Also well crafted and goes well with wooden accents in bath.
5,great looking and sturdy,"Perfect, sturdy construction, nice feel. This seat has metal hinges, not plastic like most of them do. So, it will probably last long."
1,Excessively small opening spoils an otherwise nice product,How the manufacturer could manage to make a product with too small an opening (a whole inch shorter lengthwise than the seat it replaced) goes beyond comprehension. Don't waste your money on this seat.
1,Stupid design,Never seen a toilet seat with such a small opening!!! I am not a big person. Nothing wrong with the Bamboo!
2,This Ain't No Halo. . .,"If you're looking to satisfy the craving HALO gave you for 1st person shooters, Turok is like eating a Turkey Club while craving Thanksgiving Dinner. It's similar, has some of what you want, but lacking a great deal in many other areas. Unecessarily difficult in some areas, not many ""check points"", and a flying aspect that blows and really slows the game. On the positive side, this game has great graphics and sweet weapons not to mention very violent ends to your enemies. A noble effort but I wish the good people at XBOX game development would get their act together and start making richer, more layered games. . . like HALO."
3,...I've had better.,"If you love eye candy I must confess that Turok Evolution is worth your money. The environments are awesome, and the creature models are very cool even if the graphics are a little rough. Its just to bad the controls are clunky and the weapon scheme is bad(No quick select). An assult rifle would have been nice too. The enemy AI wasn't all that good either. The multiplayer is average, but co-op, system link or bots could have made it a lot better. All in all, the game could have used more work, and I surly would have waited another six months for a better version that met XBOX standards.-Graphics 3/5-Visuals 5/5-gameplay 3/5-Sound 2/5-Enemy AI 2/5"
1,"Can somebody say ""Game of the Year""?","I cant begin to tell u how much this game rules. This game could easily beats in my opinion beats out halo. Halo has about 10 levels and this game which goes my chapters and has about 5 levels per chapter has triple as many levels halo. Also, the multiplayer action is awesome!!! This is a muct buy for any fps fan or anyone with a xbox"
2,big letdown,i think that turok could have been much better if they put more time into the gameplay. I loved the multiplayer that was the best part of the game. so i guess ill give it a 2 only for the multiplayer if the multiplayer was bad i would've liked to give it less than a 1.
3,turok,"it has an awesome arsenal of weapons, but gets a little anoying.the little dinosaurs run around you and gets on your nerves that you can't nail him. (I held myself back!)If you want a shooter thats fun, leave this one out!"
1,COULD be a 3.6 stars,The main reason for this game getting such a LOW RATING is because the control configuration is REALLY MESSED UP. You have to play with one of the two ways they give you which are basicly the same. And also the levels are easy to get lost on. IF you don't already have HALO buy it instead of this garbage.
2,"Maybe I'm on [crazy], but...","...this game was not all it was cracked up to be. Some of the graphics are nice, but you get a feeling that it lacks the polish I require when shelling out [the money]. You can tell that game development was ported from another, less powerful system than the XBOX. I'm willing to bet market timing forced it out the door a little fast, because this won't be able to compete with the titles coming out for the Christmas season. The game play is fast and smooth, but the jumping and weapon handling are rather awkward. Falling off of things is easy to do when jumping because the player's view does not seem to be consistent with algorithmic realities of time and space. There's a trick to jumping and all, but the physics, player control and graphics conspire to annoy you after a while. Turok Evolution made for a good rental with a friend, but I'd buy something else when the new generation of XBOX games and XBOX LIVE come out in Nov.'02. (reviewed Sept-2002)"
3,Dan from Tulsa,"I was a little disapointed with this game. I am all about multiplayer and for that Halo is a much better buy. It is really fun to do missions with your buddies and you can't do that with single player Turok. The multiplayer ""fight mode"" is ok but just not as good as halo. In fact Quake on Playstation 1 was just as good or better.Graphics are pretty good but movement is a little cumbersome. I played it on my Xbox and can tell you that Turok on the 64 was much better and easier to play.This could have been a great game with a few more options like co-op play. I was thinking about buying some Akklaim stock but I think I will pass..."
2,"Don't buy this game, maybe a rental ...","Turok isn't that great of game. Based on a five star scale (halo) then Turok is a two. Mainly for some interesting graphics. However, the enemy aren't that smart considering after one shot they surrender. The killing a raptor is like killing a rat in Morrowwind... not very fun for a first person shooter.After a few hours of play, the game was ready to go back to the retailer.Also, the multiplayer action is okay, but by No Link play is No fun.Rent before you regret your buy."
1,What the hell is this?,"Do not buy this game. Even though it is only 5 bucks on Amazon, and probably cheaper elsewhere the shipping wait is not worth it as you will put it down in the first hour or so. When i got it it was lame when all you do is shoot tiny little dinosaurs that could easily be stepped on. All the weopans suck and the only one i wanted was the nuke that you only get once(if you dont use it, it doesn't carry on to the next level) I wanted to see the end of the game but i despised it too much to bother playing it so i used cheat codes, the end almost sucks as much as the game. Multiplayer blows and the controls are retarded.Save yourself the frustration of looking at it next to your xbox"
2,Waste of Money,"This game was an absolute waste of money. The controls are terrible, aiming is a joke. Sometimes you move to fast, sometimes you move too slow. The worst thing about the game is the lack of checkpoints, you have to finish the entire level before proceeding...if you die (even when you are close to finishing the level) you have to restart the whole level. The graphics are good, but other than that, this game is worthless."
3,Big let down,"I sure was let down by this one. Anyone that compares it with Halo doesn't know what they are talking about. Way too much time and system resources were used to try to make the forest ""lush"". Well, it works and is impressive for about 30 seconds. After that you realize that the game is somewhat fun, but gameplay and graphics could be so much better. There are way too much adventure type jumping and finding stuff and not near enough action. I'll give it three stars because it is fun to play and in hopes that it gets better as I go along."
2,What a shame...,"The only thing I can say about this game that is truly positive, is that it doesn't completely .... I think having to live up to the Turok name is very difficult. The first few levels are very enjoyable. But the game becomes a little ridiculous. The storyline is not very good. I guess I still think back to the sense of amazement I had with the first Turok game, and this game just doesn't come close. Some of the graphics are a letdown. Look elsewhere..."
3,Dino World,"Warning: this game is not for kids!Turok Evolution for the Xbox is a first person shooter game (FPS), where you hunt dinosaurs and lizard-like aliens. Your first weapon is a club, then you'll get pistols, shotgun, mini-gun, sniper rifle, and more. The weapons get better as you progress through the game. And the best part is that most of the weapons have a secondary fire mode! There are also a few original weapons never before seen in a FPS. I don't want to spoil the fun for you, just trust me when I say they are cool. The levles are also varied. There are a few levels where you fly around. Then there are levels where you use stealth. They even included some levels where allies fight along your side. The game has a lot of potential but feels kind of limited.Pros:+good controls+good graphics+secondary fire modes+lots of multiplayer modes+good music+lots of enemies+flying levels+stealth levels+bloodyCons:-linear gameplay-small maps-limited weapon availabilty-stupid A.I."
2,Turok Evolution,This game as many others in the past has fallen way short of all the the things they said it would be. The graphics are not so great at times you think you are playing a PS2 game or even N-64 it is pretty sad. The controls are not responsive at all you have to move the analog stick at least a 1/2in before the character moves aiming is sloppy and not responsive at all in the heat of battle. It seems like this game is a demo or beta version it might be fine for people who have PS2 and don't expect better but I am sorry I wasted my money so don't waste yours it really isn't worth it. The game is setup bad and you play at least 3-4 boards with nothing but the pistol all the cool guns no where to be seen and also takes forever to load it stops game play to load in the middle of whatever you are doing. Once again a game on a 3 system release and anyone with a Xbox gets ... SAVE YOUR MONEY GET A DIFFERENT GAME!!!
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this game the day that it came out. I had played the previous Turok games, and thought that this baby would rock my world. WRONG! Each mission takes like an hour to beat, with tons of enemies with shotguns, etc. while your armed with a pistol and some arrows. The A.I. just keeps coming, and when you think you've killed them all, more are on the way. There is very little dinosaur hunting! You are always fighting stupid lizard/cyborg things. The cut scenes stink, with absolutely NO plot. I can't beleive that I bought this...It should go down in history as THE WORST TUROK GAME EVER!!!"
2,Not a very good game,"When i first rented this game, i thought i was going to get some raw, heart-pounding action. Instead i got some guys shooting a bow and arrow. I didn't play very far into the game but i don't think this will keep your interest very long. Another thing, it should be rated E not Mature."
1,Rent it first before you regret buying it !!!,"One of the worst game that I've ever played. The AI is pretty dumb. Not much action, it is more on jumping, running around and getting lost. Cant play 2 players against AI (not like in Halo). Oh did I already mention that its boring."
1,Turok evolution,"I rented Turok Evolution ,And boy am I glad I did.It saved me money buying such a lousey game.The first chapter is ok but after that it goes down hill.They give you a scope for the gun that drifts and the enemy is already lobeing gernades and fireing at you befor you get there.then they give you only one way to go but your ememies can still sneak up behind you and surround you on all sides.you can never sneak up on the enemy they know your comming before you do.Do not buy do not even rent this it is a waste of your money and time"
2,Save your money!,"... Poor graphics, boring play. .... Eventually there'll be a better FPS, but Turok ISN'T it! The ONLY reason I can see for purchasing this game is if you are reeeeally into the Turok series. This game looks and plays barely better than the version that came out on N64."
4,Not What I Excpected But Still Cool!,"I was looking at the X Box games to see if their were any I wanted.I put my eyes on Turok:EVOLUTION and I remember playing a short multiplayer round with my friend once.I ovcourse bought it and it wasn't what I excpected,but I was not desappointed either.The game has good graphics,details,overwelming weapons,interesting enviroments,cool enemys.Greate multiplayer gaming as well.This game is deffinetly a keeper.GOOD FOR EVERY TUROK FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,bad bad bad`,"I hate this book, it is not helpful, doesn't translate a lot of the exercises or examples so you don't really learn anything, you have to really search for the vocab, translation, grammer instructions, or even what chapter you are in. Bad book. Buy ""Genki""."
1,"Unsatisfying, watered-down textbook","I'm currently using Yookoso in Japanese class, and I'm unimpressed.The authors repeatedly introduce new grammatical points in the exercises, but don't explain them anywhere in the accompanying text. They take complicated problems (like when to use ""wa"" and when to use ""ga"") and reduce them to a laundry list of useless suggestions--one of which I've seen mentioned in several other sources as a common misperception about Japanese. And when there is a simple grammatical rule which would save the student much time and aggravation, the authors coyly suggest that the student learn to ""make generalizations"" and guess in order to become a ""better language learner."" Er, is this a Japanese language course or a game of keep-away? The vocabulary is good, the exercises are good, and the speed at which kanji are introduced is challenging, but I'd trade it all for a textbook which wasn't afraid to teach me how to speak Japanese."
3,hmm is 3 stars too much?,"This book does not teach at a fast pace at all. When I completed just one semester of Japanese I already amassed 3Xs the vocabulary than what it has presented in this book. If you want to study at a slower pace then go ahead and get this. It does possess some properties that make it not totally bad but remeber that there are also better, CHEAPER, books out there. If you are studying outside of a class atmosphere using either a Japanese friend or the internet chatrooms you will have better luck with this book than a normal text."
4,Anti-Fungal Powder,"Athough the item that we received was not the one picutured, it is close enough to do the job that it needs. The reason that we wanteded the Zeasorb AF is that it was recommended by a dermetologist for use on the body for allergies that my wife has. What we got was the regualar Zeasorb. If it is the same as the AF kind, that should be so stated."
5,Works great!,Worked where other products haven't. After a couple weeks the problem was solved! I had been dealing with this for years without success from creams.
3,Great product,Great product and friendly service. Good company. Love the product. Would buy again. Very happy with coupler. Everything went well.
1,Zeasorb does not work for me.,"I recently purchased Zeasorb Antifungal Powder for jock itch. It doesn't work for me. It has escalated the irratation in my groin area and has caused small itchy blisters between my fingers after applying it. It must be powerful stuff,and may be a good product, but I will resort back to my Gold Bond that never caused any problems, but wasn't all that effective on what I was using it for."
5,An inspirational and deeply touching book.,"Unafraid of the Dark is a beautifully written, inspirational and deeply touching book. I was unable to put it down from the moment I read the first page. I admire Rosemary and feel that she is an inspiration to all African American women."
3,Soleil Zip Front Hoodie,"I purchased this for my teenage grandaughter. She thought it was hot and cool. I wasn't pleased with the price, but items from this line are a little pricey for my taste. If you have a teenage girl, then she'll love it. The paarent just want like the price."
1,Not Worth It,This is essentially a bibliography--not at all worth the money if you're in need of thorough research.
2,"Get Dragon Tales, Not Great Unknown","When I bought this album, I truly ventured into The Great Unknown. I didn't know how mediocre it would turn out to be. A bit on the lame side even. Although it contains a sprinkle of the old Koxbox sound, it is not as tight as it is weird. And what's the deal with the cover art? If anything, it is likely to boost sales to the members of the community with more active libidos, but that doesn't make the music any better. Perhaps it is to make you think that the erection you get from the album is caused by the music itself. ""Wow, this must be good music, it aroused me, huh hyuk!"" I don't think so. No amount of soft porn will mask this album's repetitiveness. If you think you are in for the perfection that was their last album, think again. Dragon Tales is where it's at. Good luck finding it though."
5,"Insomniac's: ""Electric Daisy Carnival"" CD Mixed by Doran","Doran is probably one the most well known trance DJ's on the West Coast scene. He holds residency at Insomniac parties as well as the infamous Dune desert parties along side the likes of Christopher Lawrence, Sandra Collins, and Taylor. This warm energetic mix is very similar to the sunrise morning sets he performs at West Coast parties. The song selection is excellent with strong driving builds and smooth melodic breakdowns. For any trance fan this CD is definitly worth purchasing."
5,This is Baseball Fiction at its Best,"Finally a sports fiction for both children and adults. The Box Seat Dream touches the heart and soul of anyone who has ever played baseball or any sport for that matter. My son is not an avid reader but loves to play ball. He couldn't put this book down. He even brought it to the dinner table. I loved it as well. Exciting baseball games, realistic life obstacles, skills learning and fantasy all wrapped up in one book. Mark my words, this story will one day become a movie. If books were honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame, The Box Seat Dream would be inducted. It is that good!"
1,Disappointing vendor experience,"Unfortunately, I cannot review this item, since the vendor (Quality Information) sent the wrong DVD. I realized after the fact that they do have a return policy listed with Amazon. I have tried to email them directly, but have not received a response (almost one month later). Very disappointing experience, and I am troubled that Amazon would partner with such lax and irresponsible vendors. Was very much looking forward to this DVD..."
4,Great piece of work for its time,"Touch the sky is a great book for its time, but don't buy this book and expect to find a modern day guidebook. Lots has changed over the years and lots of details were not included in this guidebook. There is a new book out for the Mount Rushmore area and other areas east of Harney Peak that has something like 900 routes in it. Plenty of adventure climbs to keep you busy. If you are a fan of the Needles, and like climbing history...be sure to grab a copy of Touch the Sky. If you are looking to come and climb here...grab the new Busse and Burr book."
3,nice,i enjoy this cd. it was bought to use in a spa enviroment and has been complimented on several times. good buy.
5,Hemingway's France: Images of the Lost Generation,"A book that will make you want to see Paris for the first time and check out the haunts of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Piccasso. The book's narrative, photographs and illustrations, and use of quotations by Hemingway and his contemporaries, take the reader on a remarkably vivd tour of the writer's France."
4,stretch motivator,I tried out the precor version at the YMCA and loved the idea of systematic way to stretch my legs and hips with assistance. The Precor machine was too expensive but the Life Span accomplishes exactly the same thing for much less. It is solidly built and easy to assemble.I love that the Amazon Prime membership makes shipping to my doorstep free.
3,Definitely not built for someone who is tall,"I have always enjoyed using the Precor stretcher at the gym. I read the reviews and saw the LifeSpan was not only cheaper, but had more stretches. I am a 5' 10"" older woman in good condition with some extra weight. I was very uncomfortable leaning back as it seemed to crush my abdomin. It was difficult to breathe. I have never experienced this with the Precor. It helped holding the upper bars, but the LifeSpan was not nearly as comfortable as the Precor. In addition there is little or no padding on the outside rim of the knee pad. When bending back it is very uncomfortable on my upper shins. The black grip handles are hard on my palms. I am going to look for a leather wrap so I don't have to wear gym gloves. On the plus side there are more stretches available on the LifeSpan, and I really like LifeSpan's Quad stretch. I am going to continue trying to adjust my body position to find a more comfortable stretch."
3,okay overall,"I would rather have a stretch machine that's going to give a DEEP back stretch. This machine gives a fairly good stretch to other body parts but not really the lower back. I was a little disappointed with that, but you never know until you try :) Quality built to last a long time, for sure."
5,Stretch Machine Review,"I Love the product and customer service was great! I would definitely purchase other items from this vendor. I don't use it as much as I would like to, but, I always feel really good after I do use it."
4,Good stretch,I purchased this product after using a similar product at a hotel fitness center. It was easy to assemble and has written instructions as well as a video on how to use it. My back is feeling better since I use the machine several times a week. It takes only a few minutes to complete all the exercises.
1,Faux Stones,"Not at all what I was expecting - my daughter loves real stones, I didn't realize these were faux."
5,Washed Hat-White,"The service was quick and excellent. The size, M/L, was just right=. The hats are of very high quality and the price was very reasonable."
1,Why the price difference?,"I considered ordering this hat, but there is a $10 price difference between the small/medium ($10) and the large/XL ($20). I would need the L/XL, but not ordering because of the price jump."
5,Highly recommended for nature lovers!,"A great little book that makes it easy to wander the best of the countryside around Tokyo. We used an earlier edition that had 25 daytrips around the city and it tells you how to get there, degree of difficulty, and a suggested route along the way. It also provides details on points of historical and natural interest along each walk.It's great reading ahead of time, along the way, and afterwards."
2,A Promise Kept by Robertson mcQuilkin,The book is a good start but I was disappointed. My husband has Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease and I thought the book would talk more about a struggle he had with accepting his new roll and making peace with God for allowing it to happen. I thought is was about his journey to that acceptance.
4,General but Helpful Overview!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book, written by Kaplan. Although some of their LSAT books were not helpful to me, this ""strategic approach"" to applying to law schools was quite effective in offering solid information.The strongest sections of this book deal with how to write the personal statement, and how to create a special theme for your application. These sections give practical and insightful advice, allowing readers to hone in on their strengths and weaknesses.The main drawback of this book is that most chapters are brief and pretty general. If I could suggest to Kaplan how to improve this book, I'd tell them to expand their shorter sections with more indepth material.Overall, I'd recommend that readers check this book at their local bookstores first. It's possible that you can obtain all the secrets and tips on a brief skim of the book. For others who have not done much reading on applying to law schools, this book should be useful to them."
5,Great book,Filled with Christmas comics from the decades. Great to share with my kids. I say get a copy for your family.
5,Exactly what I wanted,This book is exactly what I wanted. Good service and no problems. So glad I ordered it. It is a very cute book.
1,Rick Wakeman referred to this as Onion,...because it made him cry.Absolutely the nadir of an otherwise brilliant career as a band.Don't take my word for it. Read about it in Bill Bruford's book. This was a dream project of the corporate jackals. May they all rot in a desert somewhere.
3,One story stands out.,"My perspective on this collection of stories is different than the other reviewers,because this is the first and only collection from the Wild Card series that I have read. To be honest, I did not think much of the stories in general, but one story stood out as excellent.Daniel Abraham's story, ""Father Henry's Little Miracle"" is the best short story I have read in sometime. The two main characters of the story are Father Henry and Gina. When I had read the story, I really wanted to take Father Henry out for a beer, and I really wanted to sleep with Gina."
4,A local politician goes to Congress,The standard treatment of Lincoln's frustrating service in the U.S. House of Representatives. Highly recommended to anyone seeking information on that subject. The author knows what he is writing about.
5,Gordon Ramsay,"This book is heaven. I love the whole book, and I am very picky about cookbooks!!! Gordon goes over the whole animal and how to make, even vegitarian meals terrific. I have recommended this book to several people."
5,Passion That Packs A Punch,"As a true poetry lover, I have yet to come across the likes of Eric Zork Alan. If anyone is reading this trying to figure out whether or not to order a copy ""Stolen Snapshots"", don't hesitate any longer. You won't regret it. The writing is passionate, honest,and completely engaging. Mr. Alan combines tremendous heart with a truly unique style. I enjoyed his book so much, in fact, I sent it to a friend. Buy it, read it, and remember what love feels like!"
5,Concise and well written,"I have for years believed in the gap theory. Without question, absolving the knowledge from many christain ministers and writers. I did no study on this until now. After a long search for a book that actually talks about the gap and what happened, I picked this book. But the author approaches the topic with an open mind, examining arguements for and against the existence of the gap. I will not say if he is a pro-gap theorist, you have to buy the book to find out. Of course Arthur Custance is quoted in many places from his masterly work ""Without Form and Void"". There is the hebrew literal examination which laymen may find boring but is certainly worth the read, you may have to read it twice to grasp the scholarly language analysis. The last couple of chapters in the book was revealing and certainly made me sit up and meditate seriously. There is meat here."
3,It looks great but not very comfortable.,"This pair of slide looks great on the website. However, it hurt my feet after I walked with it for 30 minutes."
2,not what I expected,This puppy is cute but not as cute as the picture. It is not what you expect from Gund. It is stuffed so that it's quite firm and not cuddly soft. I sent it back.
5,Brian Dack's Acoustic Guitar Disk,"A careful listening to Brain Dack's new disk Tributaries might reveal musical influences from all over the world. However, the distinctive presentation of this collection of acoustic guitar pieces is solidly grounded in Dack's home turf-- Minnesota's North Shore. It's clean, honest music that draws from the boreal elements of rock, balsam fir, northern lights, and, as the title infers, rushing water.While obviously an accomplished guitarist, Dack resists the temptation to sacrifice the soul of his songs to use them as showpieces of his technical skills. He has an excellent sense of when an extra riff, even an extra note, would detract from a song rather than improve it. The result is unpretentious music that speaks directly to places deep within the listener."
4,A Marvelous Reference,"This marvelous reference book has chapters covering fantasy fiction, horror fiction, poetry in both genres, reference sources, teaching approaches, fantasy art and illustration, a theme index, and animation (film, television, radio). Two reservations kept me from judging the book a 5: it is a bit dated with few bibliographic references more recent than 1997, and it has some remarkable gaps of coverage. For example, neither Margaret Weis nor Tracy Hickman (nor the two as collaborators) appear; the book makes no reference to J. K. Rowling, either. A reference ignoring both the Dragonlance series of more than 150 novels and the widely popular and influential novels starring Harry Potter (at least the first one) desperately needs revision."
3,Great for 1 or 2 shaves...,"I was so excited when I first used this razor because I got a really close shave and it took less than half the time that it usually does, mainly because I didn't have to stop every couple of strokes and rinse out all the shaving cream. Unfortunately, the third time I used it, the gel thing was almost gone and it gave me razor burn. I got such a good shave the first couple of times I considered buying more refills and just using them for a few times, but after seeing the prices, I can't afford to do that. I could probably save up and get electrolosis for that kind of money!"
2,Gillette Breeze Vs. Schick Intuition,"I have been using the Schick Intuition razor since it showed up on store shelves. So, when Gillette finally came out with their version of a 2 in 1 razor, I was excited to try it. Although the Gillette Breeze makes maneuvering more simplistic due to it's sleek style, the moisture/shaving strips ran out after one shave. At that rate, it could become quite expensive to replace the blade. I also agree with others - it didn't give a close enough shave and a bit of razor burn too.* Bottom Line - I prefer the Schick Intuition and will continue to use it."
1,"not a close shave with a rash for the win! er, lose.","I was looking for a new razor to see if I could improve my underarm shaving. I'm so sorry I tried this one. It had only been two or three days since I last shaved my legs, but my legs are nowhere near smooth. There's a fine stubble. In addition, immediately after use my skin got rashy and itchy anywhere the razor had touched. One of the worst razors I've ever used -- and a complete waste of my money, as the skin irritation means I don't dare use it again."
2,Itchy!,"I loved this razor the first two times I used it. But by the third time, the gel wasn't really useful anymore. I'm not the kind of person to spend the money on buying razor blades every other week. That wasn't necessarily why I'm giving it 2 stars though. If you want to spend the money, go ahead, but for me, personally, my legs started to itch very badly after a couple days. I couldn't figure out what it was at first because it persisted at least a week after I stopped using the Venus Breeze. I definitely don't want to deal with that again!It doesn't seem like everyone has this problem, so I would find one to use once and see what happens. If no itching, go ahead! It's great for about two uses - after that you might want to use some shave gel."
1,Not my fave,"I don't usually have sensitive skin on my legs but this product was very harsh. It made me itch like crazy. I've recently gone back to the regular venus divine product and the itching is gone. Be careful when using this, it wasn't much fun for me."
4,"Great results, a little pricey","I'm very pleased with the results of this razor. The gel bars are great, providing just the right amount of lubrication for a shave. Other reviewers seem disappointed with the gel - it's not a ""gel"" like one you would dispense from a can. You definitely couldn't shave dry with this razor, and it doesn't foam up, but in the shower/bath, it provides just the right amount of gel for a smooth, painless shave. I was surprised how long the gel did last. I didn't have any problems with the closeness of the shave as other reviewers noted, felt it was just right and lasted as long as other razors.This razor is 100 times better than theSchick Intuition Plus Moisturizing Care Pack, Variety Pack, 1 Pack. That is just a big block of moisturizing soap around a razor that dulls after the first use (which isn't that great itself).Overall, I'm very pleased with this razor and will continue to use it. Just wish it was a little less expensive for refills."
3,Might be handy for vacation...,"...but I could never use this as my ""daily driver."" Maybe I'm just a cheapskate, but I expect to get more than four or five shaves out of a blade-- I couldn't afford not to! Like a lot of the reviewers, I was impressed with the first couple of shaves, but noticed the gel strips dying quickly on me in the shower. Once they fell off, I found the razor head overly cumbersome to use (especially since a standard Venus razor head is no petite thing). If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor. If you're looking for something to last, though, I'd go with the Venus Divine.For the best, least irritating shave, though, I find conditioner works better than shaving gel."
5,COOLEST RAZOR EVER!!!!!!,"Venus Breeze is the best razor! Venus always makes the best women's razors. I used to only shave 2-3 times a week because I just couldn't bother with it, but this is so easy to pick up and use. Forget the shave cream or soap and buy this razor! You'll love it! (It smells really nice too) Highly recommended."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,THE 'LOTION' EDGES WERE GOOEY AT TIMES. COULD NOT GET A CLOSE ENOUGH SHAVE. HANDLES DIFFICULT TO GRIP WHEN WET AND SOAPY. DISPOSIBLE DOUBLE BLADES WORK JUST AS WELL AND ARE MUCH CHEAPER. SORRY-JUST MY OPINION.
1,YUCK!!!!!!!,"This razor does provide a smooth shave, that's all the good I can say about it. I have stubble a few hours later like always, so it doesn't help reduce shaving. I cut my ankles with this razor around 4 times because the head is so big and bulky and I missed a million spots on my knees but it shaved the main part of my leg fine. I hate the gel bars on this razor, they get gooey and stringy and the goop gets on the blades and makes it hard to shave. I would NOT buy this razor again. Also I have very pale, sensitive skin, and my skin did not break out in a rash or get bumps like other people have reported.EDIT: Do not attempt to shave your lady bits with this razor. It SUCKS! It can't even cut the hair right! It took like 30 minutes to shave down there when it takes like 10 with a normal razor. The stupid gel bars are in the way and the razors don't want to get close to the skin. Not to mention the hairs get trapped in there. GROSS!"
1,Beware of Horrible Rash,"When I first bought this razor, I was looking forward to trying it out. I tried it for around a week and a half and enjoyed using it. I felt like it was a close and moisturizing shave. However, I began to develop a horrible itchy rash on my legs. I didn't immediately connect it with this product, but it finally dawned on me that the itching got way worse every time I used it. It was a red, spotty, extremely uncomfortable rash. I stopped using this razor and went back to my old Mach 3, and my rash took around 2 weeks to heal. I tried the Venus Breeze again a few months later (I really liked it!) and that darn rash came back. It's too bad. I wish Gillette could make more products that are safe for sensitive skin."
2,Ok for legs,"The shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible. This razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary. But using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin. This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it. I did not notice a tropical scent."
1,The worst!,"I love Venus razors, but the Venus Breeze is absolutely horrible. I've never gotten so many nicks and cuts. The shave gel bars don't produce enough moisture and/or lather, so I find myself using shaving gel, and I still get nicks, cuts, and irritation. The last time I used it, a chunk of skin actually came off my leg. With the other Venus razors, I NEVER even get small nicks. To top it all off (as if the former wasn't enough) I don't even feel like I'm getting a close shave, and I actually end up shaving every day, instead of every other or every three days. I hate to be so negative, but this razor really has nothing to offer. Go for one of the other varieties of Venus razors."
1,I hate this razor!,Those pieces come out so far you can't get a close shave. They only lasted a couple of shaves then fell off and I am glad because now I can use the razor and get a close shave.
3,"good concept, but doesn't hold up","I like not having to add gel or lather to get a smooth shave. The first few times I used the Venus Breeze, I did notice a little dripping/oozing from the shave gel bars. Not after that. But the bottom shave gel bar fell off the razor long before it was 'used up'. And there didn't seem to be any way to make it stick back on. This is my first gel cartridge, so I don't know if this was a fluke or an ongoing problem. The razor still shaves: but I'm back to adding gel or lather, which really defeats the purpose of the '2 in 1' cartridge."
1,HATE THIS RAZOR!!!,"So I bought this razor thinking it'll save me time by not applying shaving cream and because I ABSOLUTELY fell in love with Venus Embrace, so I figured all Venus products would work the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! This razor doesn't get a close shave (I shaved last night and I have stubble this morning). But that's not the worse: I got razor burn and broke out in huge hives!!!! It happened last night a couple hours after I shaved. It was sooo bad, that nothing could touch my legs (pants, bed sheets) and this is even after I slathered myself with Triple Antibiotic Cream. I also got a lot of cuts.This NEVER happened to me before with Venus Embrace. I'm returning this product and going back to Embrace!!!!!"
4,Enchantment with a Twist,"This book is the story of a girl named Enid, who is just like a regualr kid the way kids actually are, and not the way that they are usually portrayed by adults. She and her babysitting charge (he wants ot be called Terrific) go everyday to the park and meet and befriend a variety of real life people. The characters, setting, and situation are just like real life, but not so ordinary that it gets boring. Many ages would like this book, but I think the reader will appreciate it more if they are older (around 9 or 10) and have a larger view and better understanding of the way life is for different kinds of people."
3,What a teenager's life is all about!,"This story takes place in the present, at the Public Garden which is a park in the city. The setting is important because the Public Garden is where the characters had most of their adventures.This book is mostly about a 14- year old girl named Enid Crowley who is a babysitter for a 4-year old boy named Joshua Cameran . they go to the Public Garden everyday and meet new friends, and have adventures, too.In my opinion it was a pretty good book. Although, they did repeat things and that got boring. But, other than that it was an interesting book. I would recommend this book because you get really into it."
4,"Fits Well, Very Thin Material","I purchased these gloves because they are watertight in the fingers and they are a small size. It isn't easy to find small sized gloves, and if there were other alternatives I might have picked something else. The gloves fit well and they keep out water, but the material is very thin. I haven't had them that long, but I doubt they will hold up to much heavy work like weeding and digging."
5,OFF THE HOOK!!!,"The Sounds of My Life is a high quality cd and you can certainly tell that a great deal of effort and passion went into creating this masterpiece! Each song is not only anointed and powerful, but they all have a unique way of taking you into a more intimate place of worship with the Most High! You can definitely sense the heartfelt worship of this artist!"
3,Excellent Start but Tepid Finish,"This book has a very creative premise, is well-written with interesting characters, and got off to fascinating start. Halfway through this book I would have rated it with 5 stars. However, I found the last third somewhat disappointing. After creating a mysterious and fascinating antagonist, the author seemed to run out of plot ideas in terms of how to satisfactorily resolve the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist and as a result the ending was very flat as the story seemed to run out of gas without any real or compelling resolution."
5,Just like the jacket says - a Catcher in the Rye,"I read this book several years ago. I was suprised to see so few comments on amazon.com. I would have thought more people found this book simply amazing, as I did. It was loaned to me by a friend with a sticky note: ""This reminds me of you.""This book is a powerful narcotic. I especially love the combination of his experiences as a child actor in Kathryn Bigelow's 'Near Dark'. I grew up haunted by the explosion of the vampire boy on a deserted highway. It was one of the first moments of sheer terror that I can remember as a small child watching movies.He was obviously more haunted by it than I."
4,Moving and Disturbing Account of Hollywood Life,"I purchased this book ten years ago, loaned out my copy and just got around to finding it and reading it. All I can tell you is, it was worth the wait. Miller's tale of Hollywood excess and dysfunctional family leaves you shaken and haunted. Jordan Highland, the main character, lacks any sort of stable upbringing save for his relationship with his grandmother, an acclaimed photographer. When her life is threatened by cancer, Jordan's own life is in the balance as well. Will he become another drug overdose statistic or will he discover the will to live in his grandma's dying moments?"
1,Does Not Deserve One Star!,I finished the book waiting for some exciting insightfulthoughts to pass but instead wound up wondering if this was just anauthors daily notes of his thoughts expressed through a third person.Please do not buy this book. END
1,Bad gingerbread,I found this product to taste like chemicals. I am a huge fan of the Starbucks gingerbread syrup so I was hopeful to find something similar. But this was awful! I gave it one star because I was required to do so.
