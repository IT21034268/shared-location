1,Never read it,"Cant say good or bad, never read it... sorry, been so busy im sure it has great stories and maybe sometime I will get to it"
1,SO boring!,I think this book was offered at 99 cents. It wasn't worth a penny! Very very boring! I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,So interesting I could not stop reading until the end.,When the book ended it made me want more. In fact the only thing that would have been better is a longer book.. Anyone who has ever had a longing for the tidbits of the past will adore this read.
1,A long read that does not hold your interest,I had high hopes for this book based on the title but found that it fell very short. I would not recommend this book unless you are looking for something that will put you to sleep for in my opinion it will not hold your interest.
3,Fair,"Book seemed disconnected and hard to remember all the characters. For a more intellectual reader who is interested in the subject and the area, it would be much more interesting."
4,Pretty good Bon'odori collection,"The person who gave this recording one star clearly did not know what they were ordering. This is a collection of music for Bon Dancing. It is a fairly good collection. I would have prefered that it match one of the printed collections of bon dances so that all of the tracks could be easily applied to dance. Also, I was less than fond of the one track that included electric guitar music. Electric guitars were still very atypical in the 1980's when I presume that this recording was produced. Regardless, I have used this recording help introduce people to Japanese festival dance."
1,A good CD to sleep!,"This CD may not be considered as dance. I thought I would hear modern songs, hit parades, but I find songs from samurai's age! I can't stand little hammers anymore. Give me a break! I slept..."
1,zero satisfaction,"I have written once that this cable is faulty,and you promised me to replace it,but...zero!!!where is a right cable for my nokia 6225 that would recognisable by my computer?Send me,pleaseEli"
5,British Aristocracy meets Gone With the Wind...,"Ardor for the Edwardian-era TV-drama ""DOWNTON ABBEY"" has spread like wildfire... THIS book (THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE BRITISH ARISTOCRACY) should be bought/read along with another (LADY ALMIDA AND THE REAL DOWNTON ABBEY- by the Countess of Carnarvon). Both books are well-written, FASCINATING, amply-illustrated accounts of privileged life, huge estates, and the excesses of an era BEFORE the War: princes, kings, queens, their MANY changes-of-clothes in one day; hierachies of invisible servants; elaborate ""no-expense-spared"" house-parties, shooting parties; the HATS; as well as no small amount of hanky-panky-behind-the-scenes... all of which DRASTICALLY changed DURING, and AFTER the War: males of all 'stations' went into battle; many were wounded; many did not return. In their absence, women were forced to manage- and prevail- during great social upheaval, political shifts, and financial constraints."
4,A Serious Study of the Decline of the British Class System,"For followers of Masterpiece Theater, be forewarned that this a serious study and definitely not a light overview of the decline of the British aristocracy. But if you have the patience to read the 700+ pages you will come away with a more profound insight into British social class and politics. Obviously David Cannadine has done his research. For an American like myself who has long been something of an Anglophile, this filled in many gaps for me. Although it assumes a knowledge of the British political and class systems that is over my head, that is not essential for gleaning the main points of this study. On the down side, the paperback copy that I have has very small, crowded print and all the pictures are dull and faded. Nevertheless, if you are seriously interested in the British class system, this is a great study. It will inform all my British reading in the future."
4,Erosion of Power,Cannadine clearly chronicles the disintegration of the British aristocracy. The book looks at several different arenas in which the aristocracy is removed from preeminence. Then it goes through the aristocracy's struggle to find a place in this new Britain. Cannadine illustrates the decline of the aristocracy with many examples of individual aristocrats' stories. I enjoyed this book mostly because of these stories.
4,Enlightening,"The book certainly makes it clear that the heyda y of the titled elite is passed. As an American I had no idea the aristocratic class in Britian had become so financially obsolete. I was aware that their wealth and political influence had declined but until reading this book I was quite under the impression that the majority of Britain's old, landed families still had their wealth and land. I had no idea those who were still prosperous were in a shrinking minority. It was an enlightening and also sad story to read."
3,Hey Greg: I'd like to maybe buy that disc from you.,"I have not seen this DVD, but might like to take up Greg the previous reviewer up on his offer to sell it for cheaper. My e-mail is: shaber@uoregon.edu. Let me know!"
5,Superb!,"I've been a Creedence and John Fogerty fan since Creedence first appeared back in the 60s. The Long Road Home is a superb compilation covering a bit of Creedence and Fogerty. Of all the CCR compilations, this one is actually the best. I highly recommend this for any CCR or JF fan."
3,"Good collection, but............................","Well, you can't go wrong with Creedence/Fogerty material, can you?This set is nice and adequate but hardly an ultimate collection.Why not make it a 2 CD set and add some pre-Creedence tracks that have John's vocals? Also, the addition of the 1973 single ""Back To The Hills"" and 1974's ""Coming Down The Road"" would have been a nice gesture.Legend says that Mr. Fogerty had the tapes of the los ""Hoodoo"" album destroyed, but the same has been said from The Beach Boys Smile session tapes, which all were digitalized in order to record the Smile we all know. Even if the ""Hoodoo"" tapes had been destroyed, why not re-record two or three of the best songs that were intended for that album?For the new fans ""The Long Road Home"" is a good start of a collection. For most of the Creedence/Fogerty fans this must feel like a missed opportunity."
5,Excellent CD,"I bought the CD for my husband and the minute he showed everyone at work, they immediately put it in and play it daily."
3,The Long Road Home,All John Fogerty songs seem to sound pretty much the same. I like most of his songs but 24 on the same CD sort of get to all sound the same
1,IT SKIPS,"SORRY, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT PURCHASES FROM AMAZON THAT IS DEFECTIVE. IT SKIPS, NEED I SAY MORE. OF COURSE I DID NOT REALIZE IT UNTIL I OPENED IT AND PUT IT ON MY IPOD."
2,A poor introduction,"As an introduction to Fogerty's career, an examination of the songwriting, this new compilation is absorbing. As an ""Ultimate"" collection though, it falls way short. It's a mess of a package. Scrambling eras, scrambling studio and live. It could work I guess, but not here. Why include ""Keep On Choogin (live)"" or two versions of Fortunate Son, when so many great tunes are left off. Where was ""Change in the weather"" or ""Someday never comes"" for example.Another thing I can't stand is when a record label chooses to combine material, such as, Sting and the Police greatest hits or the Tijuana Brass and solo Herb Alpert collection. Please don't combine. Buyers beware!"
4,Would have been 5 stars....,"This is a great retrospective hits collection and contains most of the best tracks from the two Chronicles discs, and my favorite cuts from Centerfield.But why did they leave out CCR's outstanding +11 minute version of ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine""?This track is sorely missed {:O("
3,Another Never Received Item from Amazon,"Although I placed my order on May 4, to date I have not received this CD or the other three I ordered at the same time. Apparently they're lost somewhere in U.S. Mail limbo at a recovery center. Amazon refuses to issue me a credit and I'm out $50. Don't ever take advantage of their free shipping option. You may never get your order!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"I expected alot more from the CD! I expected more or what Creedance Clearwater Revival WAS....The songs on the CD weren't the best & the quality of the CD was only average.This is not worth the time or the money! And I'm a BIG FAN of 60's Rock!! Try Buffalo Springfield, or Crosby, Still, Nash & Young or Janis Joplin with Big Brother & the Holding Co. And the old Stand By's: Beatles & Stones!! Long Live Rock & Roll!!"
2,This should be SO much better...,"This isn't even close to 'ultimate'. I loved Creedence, and I still do, but I have all these songs on Chronicle. After 40 years, Fogerty rates a first-class anthology, filled with Golliwogs material, those hard-to-find Fantasy solo singles, some Blue Ridge Rangers material, the original Asylum versions of 'Rockin' All Over The World' and 'Almost Saturday Night' (and 'You Got The Magic' as well) and any other odds and ends we can scrape together - 'My Toot Toot' perhaps? This comp is only marginally better than all those awful Fantasy repackages, and I'll be saving my scratch for the real thing - if it ever comes."
5,Nice Collection Item,My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.
4,Mediocre sound but excellent portability,"The sound from these speakers is mediocre at best: lots of midrange, very little bass. They sound like cheap car speakers. However, I teach classes and like to start the day with some music, and these speakers are perfect for quiet background music from my PC. If your music software has an EQ, increase the volume on your PC to the max, keep the speaker volume at 5, boost the bass EQ a little, cut the mid EQ a lot, and boost the treble EQ a lot. They'll sound ok at low volume, and they're so small and light won't even notice you have them in your luggage. (NOTE: the SI-5 is basically the same speaker without a USB cable.)"
4,USB Speakers w/o batteries !,This is a great on the go set of USB speakers ...Great for DVDs and MP3s on my LaptopMy Presario Laptop has crappy speakers so this really adds a dimension of sound to my laptop. Speakers had a few minor scratches on them but the sound is great for passing a quiet night in a far away hotel ...The aesthetics are only reason I am not giving 5 stars ...
1,WARNING: AVOID THIS CD,"this is one of the early CDs they put out and the sound is impossibly bad, grainy and distant. If you want to hear it, get the LP"
2,more self promotion than the discussion of the subject matter,"After reading so many positive reviews, I ordered the book, and expected to learn in-depth insight into the immortality of cells.I was disappointed. This book is more of the author's personal story of pursuing the goal of reversing aging rather than detailed look into the biological nature of aging. There are tidbits of gems here and there, but the density is low. If you are looking for a serious discussion of the subject matter, this book is not for you."
5,Great book.....hope he writes another!,"I wasn't sure if I would get ""into"" this book or not, but I found it hard to put down at the end of the lunch break or at night. Very interesting and the good doc describes even the most complex science in terms that are easy to understand-without making the reader feel like a dummy! I wish President Bush and other lawmakers would take the time to read this book to get the facts behind the science before making any more legislation regarding stem cell research."
5,Bakken rocks!,"I was assigned to read the whole book for my History 170A summer course. The info in this book is clear and easy to read and understand compared to other ridiculously boring, long books. The best part of having gotten this book assigned is that the course I took is taught by one of the authors, Gordon Bakken. Great guy, great personality, has written over 20 books, his most recent work, ""Women Who Kill Men""..recommend it!"
2,"MURDER SHE WROTE and wrote, and wrote, and wrote ...","Reruns of ""Murder She Wrote"" on cable TV were good for one thing - power naps after work. The episodes put me to sleep every time. I have yet to master the art of falling asleep while reading. The book is dull, routine, and dumb, just like the tv show, but not without that addictive pulp fiction downgraded IQ quality that keeps the pages turning. The resolution is a major let down, like a cold, burnt match concluding the final chapter. When my elderly grandmother died I inherited (took) her boxes of paperback mysteries, which certainly would have been tossed away by less inclined members of my family, mostly classics of the genre and the oddball title like this, based on the popular tv show. Assuming she had read this well-thumbed copy, I'm hoping gramma wasn't bored to, ahem, tears."
3,Not bad but not great !,"This was the first book I have read in the series (after diligently watching every episode on TV) and I have to say it wasn't bad. I felt that some of her TV characters are better developed than one or two of the characters in the book. The ending was also a bit disappointing but overall it was not the worst book I have ever read. I am, however, looking forward to reading the rest."
5,"Murder,She Wrote!","This book is the first in the ""Murder she wrote"" series and it deserves 10 stars if that was possible. I read this book and I LOVED IT! The Murder She Wrote Book series comes from the tv series which I am a big fan of as well.It stars Angela Lansbury (my favorite actress by far) as jessica fletcher a writer who stumbles upon murder's.If you have not read this book and you like mysteries read it!"
5,Awesome Headphones,"This little baby rocks my world. Comfortable, portable, good sound, good bass, good looks. What more can I say."
5,"High Quality, stylish, and sound awesome!!!","These are great headphones, and look and sound as great as my $150 Sony monitor dj headphones you see all the d.j's and mix masters wearing. I swear, these produce some serious sound quality and almost sounds as well as my sony's for almost 1/5 the price. They are comfortable, wear well on my head, have a long enough cord, and are adjustable with a few clicks on each side. Did I mention that there are little tabs on the metal rods for wrapping the cord around when the headphones are not in use. They are also foldable for easy compact storage. As for the &quot;sweat problem&quot; some people claimed to have with these, all I can tell you is that ALL traditional style headphones will have such a inconvenience. The ones I've had in the past had it, my Sonys have it, and these Philips ones have it as well. Just a flaw with the overall traditional design. These are excellent headphones and I would recommend these to anyone."
5,Great headphones for the good of the price.,"These are really the type of headphones you can use on your portable cd player. The sound quality is just what any person could ask for in headphones (only if they know what the specifications mean). First stop, the frequency response is 10 - 28,000 hz.....the wider the range, the better its sounds. And its sensitivity is up to 102 db....the higher, the louder (you always want aleast more than a 100 db). So, when the next time anyone wants to buy good headphones, always look for the sensitivity, and the frequency response. Anyways, these headphones are a good choice for sound. Also, its comfortable, adjustable, and its foldable so u can take it in your school bookbag, suitcase, pocketbook, or whatever. Buy these headphones if you dont wanna waste time looking for the right price, or a brand name."
2,Philips HP550 - Poor Sound,"Reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase the headphones. They have very poor sound reproduction on the bass end - they sound ""tinny"" with no solid base. The headphones that came with my walkman sound better - no lie - I put them to the test, side-by-side listening to the same song under the same conditions. They just aren't worth the money, honestly."
4,BEST HEADPHONES FOR THE MONEY,"SOLID VALUE WITH GOOD BASS & CLARITY. ABOVE AVERAGE IN MOST AREAS. KEEPS OUT 90% OF OUTSIDE SOUNDS. FULL SIZE EARCUPS SOFT BUT VERY WARM, THUS BETTER FOR WINTER JOGS THAN SUMMER TIME USE. PERFORMS AS WELL AS MORE [OTHER] HEADPHONES. HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION YET FAIRLY LITE. EYE CATCHING DESIGN. 4 & A HALF STARS."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with these headphones and would not buy it again. THe sound is good although ratherr hollow. A peron gets used to the hollow sound and for the money it may be expected. However the phone cups are rather small and squeeze the ears so much it becomes unformtable within a short time. The best part of wearing them is the moment they are taken off. Its a great relief to remove them. The price is good, but unless a person needs closed headphones and cant spend more, I would not recommend them. I would also note that while these are closed phones there is a considerable amount of sound leakage. Should not be used on a bus or in a library where they might disturb others."
2,poor quality,"Specifications of those headphones made them look extremely attractive especially for portable use, but unfortunately the sound this set provides is very poor. The base is nonexistent, and they do not isolate the outside noise at all. But again, those headphones only cost $..., and I guess you can't expect much for that price."
5,Excellent headphones,I bought these to replace the ... earbuds that came with my mp3 player. Needless to say I was used to poor sound quality and interference from outside noise. After first using these I knew that I would never go back to my earbuds for listening. The sound quality is awesome and Linkin Park was a good test of their bass capabilities.
2,Tawdry headphone,"I bought it based on the reviews, but this headphone is a not good. It's very uncomfortable (unless you plan to use it occasionally for a couple of minutes) and the quality of the sound is inferior to most of the ... headphones. In conclusion, this is a tawdry headphone, ... and showy."
2,Useless for blocking any outside noise,"One reason to buy circumnaural (around the ear) headphones is to reduce environmental sound.These headphones block nothing at all....nothing. I can hear the environment just as easily as if they were not on.Otherwise, adequate for the price...nothing special."
3,So-so,"I got these a few weeks ago. I didn't feel that they were as great as the other reviewers thought. In certain environments, they even seem to enhance outside noise! I've had less expensive earphones with better sound quality. But perhaps it is as one reviewer said...it depends on the device it is used with. I use mine with the Creative Nomad II MP3 player and haven't tried them with anything else. However, the earphones that originally came with the player were much better."
2,nice enough,"save your money and buy bead head phones. the sound on these is hollow, which was a suprise considering their size. essentially just not worth the price."
3,Don't expect Sonys.,"I bought these as a secondary set for my CD player, and I was dissapoitned. First of all, I got laughed at by everyone at my school because of the foolish way these things look - they look like you are from the planet Klingon or whatever - you will look like a GEEK if you wear these. Those into styles SHOULD NOT get these. Secondly, even for the price these don't deliver the quality I'd expect. I bought Labtec headphones for the same price and the bass response was MUCH greater and the exagerated tone is perfect for anyone's tastes. I am bringing these back and spending the extra money to get a Sennheiser set - but even those don't beat my 170 dollar sony's :)"
2,Average or less,"The sound quality is decent, but I had problems with sweat on the earpads, also it sits rather firmly, so I couldn't wear it for longer than an hour at one time. Also, the plastic support for the sliding frame chipped in a few weeks, I patched it up with tape, but a bigger piece broke again, so the headphones were effectively ruined. There's a reason why it's on clearance, clearly it's not worth the full price (build quality, comfort). I will probably try a Sennheiser the next time round."
4,Good for Stay- At - Home Phones,"Me and my Mp3 player, are everywhere around town. So I am constantly looking for good headphones. I have had 3 pair scince I got the Mp3 player 6 pair combined with the old cd player. When I got these I thought they were awsome at first. True they sound great, true they are comfortable, but they are by now means durable. I droped them once in a bathroom, and the fall to the floor, cracked the inside plastic, facing the ear on the headband. So I took it home fixed it and then they got droped again. The ""C"" claw that pivots the headphone, broke. Each time I tried to fix it it was to no avail. The one other thing I will give to it's credit, it that it does fold up. If you like headphones that you can really shut out the rest of the world with and then when you need to do some talking and put your phones away, these will fold up neatly into a jacket pocket. If you buy them, try not to love them too much, cuz they won't love you back."
4,Candleshoe- Book review,"So not how I thought the story would go! I'm not sure how many people have seen Disney's ""Candleshoe"", but this book is a completely different direction. What is similar: there is a little old who is raising a bunch of orphan's in her manor and there is a treasure that people are looking for. However, the main character is a little boy and the treasure hunt and other activities are unlike the movie.It was a wonderful book and as soon as I dig it out of the moving boxes, I can't wait to read it again. Just don't look for a book of the movie as this book came before the movie was made."
2,Niche product; probably best avoided,"The major selling point of this duster (and, indeed, all CO2 based dusters) is that it doesn't use a liquid propellant which can be flammable, hazardously cold (if the can isn't handled properly), or damaging to surfaces such as camera lens coatings and negative emulsions.That being said, this duster isn't nearly as ""powerful"" as the liquid propellant dusters. In fact, this model of duster is comparatively puny when compared to just about any other brand of liquid propelled duster. Also, the CO2 cannisters don't last very long at all. I was surprised when I emptied my first cannister after only a few minutes of playing around.I still use the CO2 duster when I don't want to risk getting liquid propellant on things, but for everything else I still use regular canned air."
1,This is only the English paperback of Ch. 3,"Be wary of this listing! It is NOT the hardcover of the original volume! Instead, it is a paperback (albeit in good condition) of the English translation of Boldt's chapter 3. This should have been a classic of German dressage, but instead is an expensive drop in the bucket. The paperback listing only comes up after you navigate to several layers of this site. BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
2,Caution,... as said before an expensive drop in the bucket......this is a excellent translation of only one chapter and by no means gives the overall insight that the illustrations in the original provide
4,Very good if specifically looking for info on Hotel Industry Marketing Research,"Very good if specifically looking for info on Hotel Industry Marketing ResearchPricey Yes, but has some good essential info. Not just abstract and philosophical advice on methods like in some self help type marketing books, but also has some real detailed info. For instance it has industry figures and percentages on some obscure items such as how many guests order movies in their rooms, and what types of movies they order (yes it's porn). Also other detailed figures on margins etc.Definitely a good book to have in your resource library if you are focusing on hotel/hospitality/travel marketing research (if not save your money). As I said, it's a bit pricey. Must be somewhere to get it cheaper?Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"
2,Dire picture quality!,"Even for the die-hard collector of ballet films, Anna Karenina is a dubious investment. As other reviewers have said, the picture quality of this VAI release is terrible - dark, grainy and full of filmic flickers and sparkles. Recommended for fans of Maya Plisetskaya only. For other fans of ballet, save your money on this one."
2,"Wonderful Plisetskaya, Awful Movie","It would have been a wonderful ballet, unfortunately it is a soviet movie...Images are really hard to see, everything is almost always mixed up in a dark bottom where movements and expressions are not distinguishable.Maya is really great, she has something great and dramatic that can reach your soul beyond the poor quality if images, this only can make this DVD worthy being seen."
3,Study Guide for the Therapeutic Recreation Specialist Cert.,"The guide was helpful as a general review. Just took my recertification test and did pass, but was surprized how much the guide left out. Some of the questions/topics on the test were not addressed in the guide. The outline was more helpful if you use it to research and find further information. Good Luck!"
3,CTRS study guide,"I just took NCTRC's exam in Atlanta. I passed. The book helped, but could have been improved with a broader based diagnostic groupings section. The book could also recommed other resources to help prepare the candidate"
3,Plaza Sesamo: Lola Aventras,I own several DVD's in the collection; I found this specific title really unimpressive. It's OK; I thought that they could've made it better.
4,Pretty Decent,"Pretty decent book. The best part is the ""Where to See"" portion, where hot spots to sight certain birds os listed."
4,Birds of Minnesota & Wisconsin,The book has very good descriptions and pictures. Enjoyed the front listing of birds by type. Would definitely recomend this book to others.
5,Tea Set,"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter to go with her wooden kitchen set. She's used it practically everyday since then. She's always off to ""make tea"" that's ""hot and delicious!"" It's held up so well and is definitely a quality product."
5,For piercings,"I got this product to put on my nose every night after I got it pierced, and it has yet to become infected! Great product"
4,Great for Hair,"This oil has a consistency thicker than Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The Castor oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and several other organic oils has really revived my natural coils."
3,Smells weird,I bought this product because I heard that it helps to grow your hair. To be honest I've only used it probably 4 or 5 times and I had to mix it with olive oil and fresh smelling rose water because I couldn't stand the smell or the very glue like sticky thickness of it. I guess I haven't used it enought to see the results that I wanted.
5,Wonderful enchanting music!,This album is a fresh interpretation of late medieval music. The musicians are at their best with a close personal representation of this beautiful music. Highly recomended!
2,Not versatile,"Like the other reviewer said, the speakers are cheesy, but I was hoping that the adapter would be of use in other ways. Unfortunately, their plug will pretty much fit only their own product."
1,A good toy camera,I got this camera from a gift. It looks very slim and compact. Unfortunately it always takes picture off the target because it takes 1-2 seconds to shutter after your press the button. I just gave it to my 2 year son as a toy.
4,good for the money...,"For the money this camera is not a bad investment. I just bought it a few days ago and have used it quite a few times. The battery depletes a bit quickly but I have found that most digital cameras ""eat up"" batteries so this doesn't bother me much. The picture quality could be better but, like I said, for the money it isn't bad..."
4,Great Compiliation of Lionel Catalogs,"In a nutshell, these are excellent references for Lionel collectors. The catalogs are not modified or severely retouched and this is one heck of alot cheaper than purchasing the actual antiques.It should also be noted that there are variations of these catalogs and that these books really do not go into why there were variations or details between the catalogs. However, they are still excellent reference points for Lionel and should be the starting point for any serious collector."
3,Great book with a lot of mistakes,This book was recommended to my by a professor. When I received the manual I started searching some of the sites. Many of them are out dated and no longer exhist. I also found a lot of spelling and typing errors. The book is a great resource but an updated version would be nice.
5,Simply the best!,What can I say; this tiny gadget works perfect in my blackberry phone giving me increased memory space and fast data retrieval.It is good!!!!!!!
5,Great deal if you can find it!,"This is a great deal. If you are looking for a micro card, definitely get this one because of the adapters unless you know you'll never need the adapter. I stayed safe by getting this one since it has both adapters. It all comes in a great clear plastic storage case. What I'm discovering is that even with a search on Amazon, you might not find all they have. I almost bought a micro SD card without the adapters because I couldn't find it. Keep searching in different ways and you might find what you really want."
5,"GREAT Price + all the converters, awesome!","Funny thing is, my friend had to buy a little 2gb micro sd immediately and he ended up at bestbuy.... spent $44 for a 2 gb card and the same 2 converters. He bragged about catching it on sale! Crazy!I checked out amazon and found the same thing for $15 dollars .... with almost no shipping. Great price and the exact same product.Came in about 5 days.Can't beat amazon :D"
3,"Well, it is not a genuine sandisk, but it works fine.","Uh, just what the subject says. Not a genuine sandisk, the label looks like it came from a inkjet printer on low, and the microsd card pins are bronze, not gold plated, like a genuine one, but it works like a charm."
2,Digital Media Source has high shipping,"This is a great product, but watch who you buy from. Some of the individual sellers, like Digital Media Source, rake you over the coals in shipping charges. I tried to order 4, which should be $5 max shipping for the size, and they were charging $30 for the shipping. I didn't complete the order and will look for another seller. Even if they are charging a bit more, at least they are honest in their pricing."
3,card works but adaptor doesen't !,"I received the 2 gb mcroSD card with the two adaptors as advertised. The screw up is that the SD adaptor does not work. Even though it is convenient to use this from my cell phone directly (through a USB cable that came with the cell phone), this is nevertheless a problem. The card itself works fine !"
2,Not as Good as Words,"I was disappointed in this most recent album of Ms. Austin. Her material is becoming more pop than country and her voice is sweet but not outstanding. Jolene is one of the best songs on the album in my opinion, however. I would not rank this album with recent efforts of Sara Evans, Trisha Yearwood, etc."
3,Including all the tracks from the original album would help.,"With the exclusion of ""Hedgehog"" and ""The Stanley"" from the original album it leaves a bit to be desired. Fidelity is lacking being a little short at higher frequencies. On a upscale note, however, ""No One's More Important Than The Earthworm"" has the very distinguishable flavor of the 1970's. A combinaton of classic hard rock and psychodelic lyrics that no one can relate to."
3,Good Quality but uncomfortable,"Good sounding headphones, bass is good, I like the volume controls on each side. Only problem is that the inside will hurt your ear. I used covers that I had on my aviation headset that you can get for $4 and then they were very comfortable. My headphones lasted for 2 weeks, my 5 month old son, pulled on the cable and one side doesn't work anymore. I'll be heading to target to get another one."
1,Don't buy it!,"These are probably the worst headphones ever built. They are totally uncomfortable and oversized for a normal person (the one with a head diameter under 12 inches). I can't imagine who wears them at full size. Also, they worked fine for about 15 minutes. After that the left speaker literally ""died"" and never recovered, no sound at all. Please don't waste your money on this stuff!"
3,"I though I killed them, but others have same problem","These head phones are great, comfortable, good sounds, good bass.My only problems were the volume control, besides the fact that they are worthless (who want to change it independently? It just plain silly) my problem was like one other reviewer, one of the volume controls would cut out right around maximun"
3,"Good value, but not enough comfort","Not bad for the price. The padding is made out of synthetic leather, which does not dissipate body heat well. You'd be surprised how warm and weird it makes your ears feel after an hour of use. otherwise, it's comfortable.Sound quality is acceptable, although i didn't hear much bass.I especially like how there's only a single cord coming from the left earcup.Conclusion: if it's comfort you're after, make sure the padding is especially design to facilitate heat dissipation."
5,5 Stars for the Value for what I paid for,"I am easily distracted by the sounds of coworkers snapping gum, eating sunflower seeds or clipping fingernails. Rather than be a complainer, I used little headphones and cranked my music. It helped until the little headphones broke. I went running to the corner store and found these on sale. That was 3 years ago. They are great. Their extra large size really helped cut out surrounding noise, and gave the added bonus of better music tones than my little headphones gave me. Mine are the same model number but they look a little different. Mine being the Philips Headphone ""SBC"" HP170, I think the SBC = more padding around the ears? Hard to say with that photo here. But they do look a bit different. Definitely worth the price I paid and then some."
3,Meh... you can do better with your money,"So I bought these headphones about 10 years ago or something like that and they have worked all the way up until now... the jack is starting to go bad... but that's a pretty long time... that's about the only positive thing about these things... the sound quality is ""OK"" and the comfort is... well lets just say they aren't the MOST comfortable headphones... for the money their are a LOT better... one of my biggest problems with them is they aren't very loud at ALL... the Bass isn't good at all... they are a cheap pair of headphones... I mean if your looking for good headphones for cheap I would look elsewhere unless these go on sell for about 15 bucks... that's really all they are worth."
3,good until the ear covers disintegrate into a million flakes,"I really enjoyed these headphone until the plasticky covering over the ear pads started to flake. When I arrived home from work my wife kept asking from where are these black chunks coming. Eventually I realized it was from these headphones.Ears pad covering aside, the head phones are great.1. They fully cover my ears but they don't make my ears hot because they're big enough to leave some gap between my ear and the ear pads.2. The built-in volume control is nice.3. Extra long cord."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Granted, these headphones sound great when turned down very low, but i listen to death metal and if you listen to the same, do not buy these headphones, they sound like crap"
1,Boo,"I know these are old headphones but in case anyone is considering getting a pair... DON'T. Worst headphones ever! Sound, comfort, quality... horrible. Simply horrible."
1,For big heads only,"I bought a pair for use at work and I loved them, so I ordered another pair for at home. Too bad they had changed them so that they were too big for my head. It was a big disappointment. I hate when things get ""updated"" in a bad way. Fortunately they paid the return postage..."
4,Good Headphones for the price!,I received the Philips HP170 headphones recently. I find they're comfortable and they rest easily on your head. The sound is pretty good. I haven't had any problems with this product.
4,Great headphones for $20.,"I read a review about the philips HP170 on a hi-fi forum and went to target.com and found they carried these at my local Target. I went there and they had about 6 pair of em in stock. They didnt fit so good at first but the band is really durable and they seem to mold yoru head after about 20 minutes. I did push on em a little to try and get the seal a little better. The sound quality is excelent, they are a nice set of cans for $20. I would recomend them to anyone looking for a good sounding set of headphones. The sound is full, nothign is scouped or left out. The HP170 have a very neutral sound and give higher end cans at 2X the price a run for their money. Remember headphones get better over time, the diaphram loosens after hours of use (usualy about 50-100) and they really start to sweeten up.These deserve a 5 star but i only gave them a 4 because of the fit. There isnt much for adjustments. The band is flexable so they can be bent and twisted to fit better."
1,Terrible,I bought these headphones because i was impressed with the specs for the cheap price. I later realized that these headphones have a cheap price for a reason. They are not durable. They do not cancel any sound. and they just all around suck. Dont not buy these headphones for any reason whatsoever. I recommend the Senneheiser 212 Pro model headphones for a much better quality and sound.
2,horrible,big mistake i just ordered some koss r80s go with those they are 10 bux more and have 2 times as much bass..im listening to metallica right now and cant even eher any bass....treble is ok recommended if you want to waste your money..dont buyyou get what u pay for
3,Not too bad... some problems,"I just got these and the first problem I encountered was the right speakers volume control wasn't working properly. When it was turned up all the way it would cut in and out unless I got it set in the right spot. Other than that they seem to work pretty well. They're not the most comfortable heaphones around (a little bit stiff) and as I write this and look at them, the covering for the left speaker is starting to come off... 15 minutes after I opened the box. Of course, for $(...) it's not a bad buy."
3,plug short,"I have had these headphones for 4 months, 3 of those months i have been using only one side because of a short in the cord. I cannot fault the Headphones for the short because I tend to step on the long cord. so I spent 6 bucks for a new connector at another retailer and soldered it on. If I have another a problem I am going for a more expensive brand. The sound is great for the price tho."
5,Little giant,"Excelent product....there is nothing as good for the price....I own it with my media player slimdevices squeezebox, and they match perfectly!If you have a small to medium room, and a pair of speakers with at least 89dB, this product is for you!!Vitor"
4,"How 'bout that! Small, but oh my. . .","I'm very pleased with the little jewel of an amplifier that Sonic Impact puts out. The first one I purchased failed within hours, but Beach Audio replaced it promptly, and I have been using it on a nearly continuous basis for weeks now. The clarity of sound is outstanding and rivals that of any sound system I have owned (and I've owned a few!). I bought a power supply (14v 2+amps) from Fry's Electronics to power it. That was a wise decision, as I now get about all the sound I can safely wring out of this little unit. I coupled it with a pair of JBL Control One speakers, and when disappointed with the lower end (hey, forgive me; I'm a string bass player!), I added a powered sub-woofer. Now my CDs and XM radio broadcasts are reproduced with clean power and sound fantastic. So much belt for the buck!"
3,Really needs some very efficient speakers,"This little thing wont pump a lot of volumen if not hooked up with some high efficient speakers, with >90 db of sensitivity. Very noticeable lack of bass. You get what you pay."
4,A Great Little Amp,"I purchased this amplifier to hook up to my digital cable box. I was impressed by the power of such a little device. It took about 5 minutes to install. I could not find a power adapter, so I am using 8 AA batteries. Now I can listen to the music channels on digital cable without the television on. Very enjoyable.My only complaint is the battery compartment. It has 2 layers of 4 batteries. The springs on the top level made it difficult to insert the lower level of batteries. Very frustrating."
4,great amp just as expected,"Have owned and used this amplifier for approximately 4 months. There weren't many options for miniture amplifiers, but it was great to find such a perfect solution. The Sonic Impact T-Amp received great reviews, so I figured it would be a good purchase, and it has been so far. I only use it with an AC/DC adapter, so no idea if the battery operated feature works well. But it works great with an AC/DC adapter. And it is really easy to use. Only the on/off/volume dial leaves a little to be desired. It is flat against the surface of the product and does not stick out enough to grasp with a finger and thumb, so you end up using the friction of a finger or thumb to turn the dial. Wish they would have used a knob, but I presume I could change that myself if it really mattered."
2,Sonic Impact,"The product was faulty. One of the springs in the battery compartment was broken off, so it will not hold the batteries properly."
4,Sonic Impact Amplifier is excellent,"Install the batteries, plug in the 3.5mm stereo input, connect bare flying speaker wires between the amplifier and the speakers and you are done. I would have liked to have had a 3.5mm stereo out as well."
4,Poof!,"Driving my bookshelf speakers, my 5066 sounded just great for the money (for any money really), though it lacked tone and balance controls, looked awful and had cheezy interconnect terminals. I speak in the past tense about it because while re-arranging the multitudes of equipment on my workbench, I managed to plug the wrong AC adapter into the poor thing. Poof, my little 5066 became a thing of the past. I then bought the Super-T amp which performs like the orignal T-amp and also lacks tone and balance controls, but the Super-T has a nice looking metal case and better quality interconnects. I recommend the Super-T over the 5066 if only for aesthetic reasons, assuming you can afford the extra $'s. Otherwise, if you are on a tight budget, get the 5066. Either way, you won't be sorry."
4,good amp - but does not include power brick (!),"The Sonic Impact T-Amp is good, it works and sounds great (i've got it hooked to a pair of JBL E10 speakers and my slimdevices SqueezeBox).However it is lacking one major thing:It does not include the AC power adaptor brick that anyone sane will need. As if I'm going to use 8 AA batteries for an amp. Ordering the 12V transformer from sonic impact costs as much as the amp itself. Are most people seriously buying this thing for portable use?"
3,Nice fit but WOW what a cost,"Replaces white original on my TroyBilt 8 HP chipper vac, and the fit is fine, but what a high price. If it lasts the 10 years the original did I'll be OK with it, but this is much more than buying a second bag with the unit would have been. Live and learn - buy extra high wear parts when you buy the unit."
2,"bag fit, but quality is questionable","The bag I bought fit the chipper, but after a few loads the elastic that fits around the top of the chipper chute broke, thus the bag now falls off and leaks around the chute. It was very expensive for the quality of the product."
1,"Bag fit, but not worth the money","The bag fit perfectly, but when I used it for the second time the seams starting comming apart, and I noticed that the zipper was coming unsowed. In my openion it is not worth $10."
4,Emerald Aisles video - Gary Moore,"Arrived in condition exactly as described - VHS cassette in excellent condition, cover/slipcase a bit worn, but still very good. Thank you - this item has been very difficult to track down. I first viewed it about 15 years ago when I borrowed it from a friend, and have never seen it in any retail outlet, so I'm very happy to have acquired it at last. This is an excellent portrait of Gary's hard rock period (before ""Still Got The Blues"" and the subsequent blues-oriented albums). He amply demonstrates his guitar-shredding prowess, and deserves to be regarded as one of the all-time greatest guitarists."
4,There Goes a Garbage Truck,This is my first purchase in the series. My 16 month old son loves it and watches it intently every single time. Becky and Dave are indeed silly but consider the age of the audience. I wish the video would stay focused a little longer on the garbage truck doing it's thing. They show it often but cut away so quickly. My son does not care so much for the parts with too much conversation. (At least not yet). He just wants to watch the trucks. I think the video is educational and is definitely worth purchasing. I'm the one with the complaints - I'm sure my son loves it. He carries it around with him just to look at the garbage truck on the cover. When I say that we are going to watch it he sits down and waits and does not get up till it's over.
4,Dave and Becky are at it again,"Dave and Becky explore the world of garbage collection and recycling in this instalment that is typical of this popular video series. Maybe because there are fewer types of trucks, there is more horseplay than usual and less information. In contrast to a previous reviewer's child, our toddler prefers ""There Goes a Fire Truck"" which has the opposite tendency -- more explanation and just a few antics. The garbage trucks are interesting, especially the automatic truck that has an arm that lifts the containers and dumps them, and there is encouragement to recycle as we visit a recycling plant. We have about ten of this series and I'd rank this toward the middle of the pack; though it's still worth watching, our child views this one less frequently than others."
2,Disaster at the garbage dump,"This video briefly touches upon the workings of a gabage truck and the dump site. The main characters Becky and Dave act silly most of the time. Parents, beware of the garbage truck that gets loose and rolls down the street by itself, Becky being dumped from the dumpster into the garbage truck and Dave locking Becky in the garbage can. Not at all appropriate for a 3 yr old."
5,ANOTHER GREAT TAPE IN THE SERIES,"MY 3 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS VIDEO.IT IS VERY EDUCATIONAL,EXPLAINING WHERE THE TRASH GOES AFTER IT HAS BEEN PIKED UP;TALKING ABOUT LANDFILLS,RECYCLING,AND SHOWS ALL KIND OF GARBARGE TRUCKS AND STREET SWEEPERS.OF COURSE,HOSTS DAVE AND BECKY MAKE IT ENJOYABLE FOR CHILDREN."
2,Not enough garbage trucks in action.,"Even though this is one of the only garbage truck videos I have ever found, I wish it had more to do with the trucks than the two stars of this movie. My 3 year old son (whose whole world is garbage trucks) said said he wanted to see more trucks and less of the ""stupid man"" acting silly."
1,farce,"this video was a farce to all garbage collectors. it advertised rearend trucks on the box but none in the video!! that's false advertising. their idiotic cariature was a slap in the face to trash workers in general. you don't stop to pick up trash w/o applying the parking brake if you leave the cab!! what if the truck ran away & hurt or killed someone? it's was a limited display of front & sideloaders. how can they forget the most versatile of them all?! the good old rear loader. it uses chains, cart tippers, kickbars or cables. also they could've talked about rolloff trucks or lugger trucks. it ws very limited on the trucks they talked about with their buffoonic shenanigans."
1,Not for air dusters,"I got this for the reload able keyboard duster I got from staples and it is not the correct size, furthermore the duster itself is not worth any price other than free"
4,Nice gift for a collector,"I got this for my grandson who is 11 years old. The stones are unlabeled and there's a little book where the collector can look up the stones and determine what they are, then write the names on little cards which fit in the compartments."
3,basic,It is exactly what is says it is...a box of rocks. My daughter loves them so its a great deal for the price. I only wish they would have a better labeling system for the rocks instead of searching through the book and trying to match them.
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting the rocks to be labeled in the kit. They came with a book that you are supposed to use to identify them, but the book had a lot more rocks in it than were in the kit. I could not tell what half the rocks were, which totally defeated the purpose of the kit. I'm going to send it back."
4,Geo rocks,"The rocks will be interesting to study for my 5 year old. However, the rocks came in a bag instead of the handy box. I would have liked to have the box to keep the rocks organized."
2,"Audio Flashcards for Passing the PMP and CAPM Exams, 4th Edition","Unfortunately I didn't realize this was not the study material for the PMP Certification test after Sept 25, 2005. Do not order the 4th edition as it is now out of date."
2,Format Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased the CD to listen in my car while commuting, but the CD doesn't work in my car. I have an older CD player and my car doesn't read a CD-R format. Sadly, this defeats my purpose. For the price, they should be delivering a higher quality product"
5,easy to follow tutorial,"I really like this book because the author leads the reader step by step and he gives lots of examples. The appendix part at the end of the book is very helpful. Although there are parts that are not-so clear, if you follow it through it'll be clear at the end. I would definitely recommend this book for somebody who just started using actionscript."
4,Excellent teaching methods - proofreaders apply please,"This is a good book and well worth its price. I especially liked the smartclip chapter and the keyboard has been very busy with me putting what I learned to good use. If you are a game writer this may be an excellent book for you also. There is a caveat here, however. The book is filled with errors, references that aren't there, missing flas, flas with ""work"" already done when they are meant to be the ones readers practice with. No doubt this was due to deadlines. Still [sigh]. This is a good book for getting used to writing your code from scratch. No references to the ""normal"" actionscript mode, so you more or less have to type away. Not a bad thing. If, however, you are the kind of person that is very ""linear"" and do not do well when you have to figure out why something doesn't work when you did ALL the steps correctly - this may not be the book for you."
5,Author is a born teacher,"The best thing about this book? It teaches ActionScript in a way that's easy and fun to learn, as opposed to following how the language is structured. How to describe this better ... would it be more fun to learn English by reading Stephen King or books about grammar? King, of course, and that's what this book does - it teaches in a way that's easy to absorb, but still technically deep. The other Actionscript books are just dry tomes on grammar, or written for those who are already experts.Actionscript in Action is clear enough for non-programmers, but deep enough for Flash gurus. It's reader-centered, not language centered - the author is really trying to show us how great actionscript can be - he's more like a quirky nature show host than a boring, droning professor.The book covers everything you need to get up and running quickly, from basic interactivity to OOP to XML, and some really bizarre effects. And, of course, the fish. The fish are cool."
4,Decent install kit,"I bought a ventless gas stove for my living room, and it came with no connecting materials. I found this setup (which claims to be for dryers, but can be used on any similar gas appliance). The gas piping is flexible but sturdy and it comes with the adapters one might need to match the gas feed to the hose. It took only minutes to add in an adapter and connect up my stove/fireplace. It has brief instructions that will get anyone through a hookup, but it really doesn't take much to use the kit to install a gas feed to an appliance: water heater, clothes dryer, whatever. I'm not sure its half-inch size is suitable for a full sized cooking range though. It works fine with liquid propane or natural gas. I think I did okay choosing to purchase this kit, and my stove/fireplace warmly agrees."
3,"Great shooter mechanics, horrid voice acting","Castle Shikigami 2 is a must have for anyone itching for a return to games like Raiden or R-Type or even Galaga. it's very itcy triggered, and the x8 bonus makes sure you try to skirt danger as closely as possible. The story is basically nonexistent, and the english dub of the cutscenes are not only nonsensical (but hillarious) engrish but are also recorded on bad equipment (I swear it's a Radio Shack mic, and it doesn't mix properly with the rest of the sound.) but they keep the japanese for the actual shooting segments so you're not snorting milk out your nose while you're trying to kill stuff. Unless you're still laughing at the cutscene before the boss fight. also, it supports screen rotation, so if you can turn your TV sideways(or maybe lay on your side just right), you can enlarge it to fill up the whole tv screen with shooting action. All this adds up to a very nice kitschy package for a suggested price of $9.99. Make Purchase for Happy Time!!"
5,timeless,"As a teenage tourist who frequented the U.S. during the early eighties, a copy of Lisa Burnbach's TOPH was a guide to the world of preparatory schools, Ivy League and Brooks Brothers. This book was fun to read as it revealed the core of the American upperclass system . A journey from the crib, prep school,country club life to the Prep Parthenon without missing a beat. This book from the eighties is truly timeless."
5,TOP DRAWER,I absolutely LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this book (said squarely with lock-jawed teeth)! This book is great I stole my older sister's copy shortly after she got it. It was in my backpack nearly everyday from 7th grade til 9th. I used to be able to quote page and verse... then we moved to Texas where I had to hide my preppy heritage until collage them it came back out with a vengeance! Still have this well dog eared book on my bookself today. By the by the Bloody Mary Recipe contained in the book is fabulous!
5,"Great book, funny and true at the same time","I received a copy of this book as a ""Secret Santa"" gift in college, because it it screamed my name according to the gift giver. Later, my friends chose a nickname from the pages of the book, only to choose the same nickname my grandfather had all his life. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the book is priceless, but at the end of the day, Birnbach hits the mark so well. Her humour and truth at the same time bacame a hallmark in later books, like her ""Guide to Colleges"". A definite must read and must own. If you can find the ""I Hate Preppies Handbook"" it makes a nice companion."
5,Excellent Book,"I like this book for so many reasons, I enjoy it in a tongue-in-cheek way about how silly preppies were. But I also truly enjoy a peek into this kind of society life, there are definitely aspects of this life that I'd like to emulate. The book was easy to read and I got through it very quickly, its also full of fun pictures and diagrams. Preppy sex?! check it out!"
4,A Sociological Masterpiece-or a Disaster,"I ran into this book in 1982, when I transferred from a small college to a major university-not because I wanted to be Preppy, but because how it had absolutely consumed the majority of the student body to BE as Prep as possible-and it couldn't be avoided, no matter how hard one tried to ignore it. While the book was meant to be somewhat satirical, the impact it had was huge at that time, increasing and encouraging an already present 'us VS them' mindset that I think persists to this day. It's a good book nonetheless, and I'm surprised that a updated/revised version hasn't come out by now. But I shudder at the possible impact that would have."
3,Excellent Product!,Excellent product but pay attention to the description and not so much the picture. I did not pay attention and from just looking at the picture I thought it was a CAP! Ordered wrong -product.
3,The method is great the book could be improved,"Catalysis as a method is very powerful no doubt. Catalysis the book is a different story. I consider myself lucky in the respect that I had a subset of the method taught to me by people that have had some input to the Catalysis method (from University of Brighton, UK). I was also impressed by IS A RUNNING THROUGH EXAMPLE? A case study is desperately needed and it could easily replace some of the other material in the book. I know that if one can apply the techniques described in this book (not necessarily the full set) better more robust software will be the result. It is a shame that you need loads of time to get through the book. Given the choice I would have still bought this book but I believe there is area for improvement in the book not the method. END"
1,confusing and incoherent,"If you know a lot about UML, don't read this book. If you know nothing about UML, don't read this book. If you have picked up a few UML books but never finished any of them, you won't be able to fininsh this one either. There are use case diagrams that are not UML's use case diagrams. There are static diagrams that are not UML's static diagrams. Joint actions are use cases. Type spec is degenerate collaboration. Collaborations are refinement of use cases...This book is full of this kind of slightly off definitons and NOTHING NEW."
4,Cats into everything,This is another picture book as a tribute to the Walkers cats and their special bonds with their cats. Good photography and i enjoyedthis as well as other books/magazine articles on them.. I have thecat walk with some of their additions/posts/colors. My cats love itand recommend using their suggestions. This is another tribute topeople who love their cats and aren't afraid to show it and share their love.please spay and neuter so that many cats won't die in shelters.
5,They Sure Are!!!,"Amazing what cats can ""Think"" of to get into. Such delightful creatures to watch,enjoy,love!!!"
1,Cats into Everything,"After everyone's 5-star rating, this book was a big dissapointment. I love cat picture books, but not this one. It's too modern with ""rapid fire"" pictures, too many on a page, way too many boring shots of cats on glass shot from below. Individual pictures were so cluttered with household stuff the result was a ""find-the-cat"" puzzle. I also hate full pictures in the ditch of the binding. Pages were so cluttered it reminded me of a modern math text with a scramble of information splattered all over the page. To tell you the truth, I hated it so much I haven't read any of the captions or text. And I can't think of a soul I know to give it to. I guess it's a Salvation Army donation."
3,Novice need to read,"If your a novice/beginner this is a good start. It covers a great deal of areas in a consice way. However, if you are already in the market and trading this book is a waist of time. There were not any insights into the mind of a market maker like I was hoping for."
5,Marker Maker Must have,"This is the first book written for the public from a market makers point of view. If you day trade you must read this book. It fills in gaps in all other day trading books. The author does go out side this area to fill the book, but the additional material is worth the read."
4,Great,Good reading for all. Action oriented real world ideas. Good description of mental & physical state required for success in the market.
3,Nothing New,A typical basic stock book that tells you about moving averages and most of the other basics you probably already know. I did not learn any tricks of market makers in this book as I hoped I would.
2,No Market Maker's Edge,"Any of the techniques described in this book are available to anyone. However, these are tactics that are probably explained better elsewhere. I still feel those just getting started should read a book like this, but the title of this book is a misnomer. He does not provide any detail on what ""The Market Maker's Edge"" is. He certainly doesn't give away any secrets about what market makers do differently that gives them an advantage over the average day trader."
2,Very misleading title,"I had high expectation for this book but it failed me. It is a general trading book, does not even mention market makers much."
1,Title is Misleading.,"After reading the book, I still do not know the ""edge."" All it talks about is the usual nonsense about moving averages, oscillators, etc. which one can find free online."
5,Required reading in my opinion.,"This was the 30th book on the markets and trading that I read. I'll admit I quit trading several times. But, I find this book is way better than the books I read years ago because it has specific ideas on how to trade. I loved the section on gaps and the great ideas like what he calls up-hooks and reverse hooks. I believe this book kind of screwed my head on straight for trading. But, I'm still in a period where I wanted to read for several months before I start actively trading again.I should note however, that I did a weirdly good trade right after reading the book. I believe this was the first time I made an amazing trade. I shorted a stock close to $29 and exited two days later when the stock was around $24. (Actually, I had bought a put option for $0.80 and sold it for $2.15.)"
2,"good primer, but buyer beware","This book teaches the basics, but you never have the experience you need to be successful until you have actually done day trading. No book can teach you those hands on skills."
2,Disappointing book- misleading title,"This is a good book if you do hot have other trading books on your shelf. Otherwise, I didn't find any other insights in this books that aren't in any others. As far as the ""market maker's edge"", it didn't expose very much about how market make's trade. It cover's a lot of the strategies used and covered in most good trading books, i.e. support/resistance, indicators etc. If this is the way that mm's trade - then I guess this book is accurate. But I would like to know what leads mm's to move a stock in one direction or another, how do they work in concert with each other to effect moves in a stock etc. Those insights I would find useful in my trading."
3,Some Insider Secrets Worth Knowing,"While much of what Josh Lukeman has written in ""The Market Maker's Edge"" you can find in a dozen other investment books, his insights into how a 'market maker' thinks and operates were worth the price of the book for me. We all wonder who the 'they' is that actually buys and sells the stocks we invest in. In every stock, there is usually one person who determines at what price the stock will open, and who is the traffic cop entrusted with seeing that the trading in a stock or contract is as orderly and fair as possible.Since Josh has 'been there and done that', I found some of his insider knowledge to be most useful as I look at making or exiting a trade. All-in-all, this book is a worthwhile addition to your library and you'll probably get your money's worth out of it."
2,Jack of all trades,"Covers a little bit of almost everything, but none more that scratches more than just the surface. I did find one chapter useful: the economic indicators and expected reactions of missing or exceesing estimates. Otherwise, the rest of the book covers only the most basic chart patterns, candles and indicators and will be fairly useless to most people."
3,Decent book but I wanted more,"I wanted more stories about how the market makers take our money, how they work big orders, how they deceive each other, and I didn't get that from this book. This book is still worth reading."
3,Good but not that good,I LIKED THE LION PORTION BETTER THEN THE SNOW LEAPARD PORTION. I DONT LIKE TO SEE HUMANS IN MY ANIMAL SHOWS. WHEN THEY DONT GET ENOUGH FOOTAGE THEY ALWAYS SHOW HOW THEY TRIED TO GET THE FOOTAGE & THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO WATCH. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS DVD
5,"Get this book first, if you're interested in simple living.","This is the best book I have ever read on simple living. The writer not only knows his history, but he can write. I especially liked the chapter on Emersonian views of simple living.Richard J. Lorenz"
5,Best book on plain living,"I was one of the few (maybe the only one) that reviewed this book when it was in hardback version. Then, and now, I'll say this. I have read almost everything on the Simple Life, on the esp. American versions of same, and frankly, no book, no tens of books, are better than this one.Since you can buy it used pretty cheaply, do so. You will never forget this book.Then, as now, I esp. liked the details of the Simple and Plain living philosophies of the Emersonian era, along with the revolutionary era.Ok, some specifics. It goes by chapter through different stages of America, from the revolution (this is from memory) through the Carter era (again, if I remember correctly). It gives dispassionate detail and is very well written. The section of David Bok (the editor of the Ladies Home Journal (if I recall correctly) was also interesting.I don't know why this guy (David E. Shi) isn't more well known.Buy the book.Richard J. Lorenz"
3,It didn't do much for me .,"When Queen Zara of the supposedly neutral planet Nubria hides refuge rebels from the Union, she is punished with a forced marriage to Logan. There is a great deal of physical attraction between the two, but can Zara trust her unknown husband with the psychic bond that forms between husband and wife on Nubria? Patricia Waddell creates a world both futurist and ancient in Whispers in the Stars, but I found the pacing slow and the arranged marriage problems poorly handled. It is not a bad book, just one that I had problems getting into, but fans of this sort of romance might like it."
2,"Decent bag for your dice, if you don't have tons.","I got this dice bag for my birthday, so I'd have somewhere to keep my dice other than a bunch of ziplocks. It is *MUCH* smaller than I expected, and can only hold 1-2 sets of dice. I gave it to my neice, who's only got one set. The quality of the bag is GREAT, it's just really small. This is good for keeping a couple of dice for someone new to the hobby, or a special set of dice. The seller was AWESOME, so don't hesitate to buy from them."
2,Remember The Alamo!,"Let me say this: this dvd is not what most people would expect from the title at all. If you are a student of military history, forget this dvd. Less than two minutes are devoted to the actual fight. Basically, it says a young Tejano boy is asleep in the Alamo, he hears his mom shout that the Mexicans are attacking, there is some shooting and hand to hand combat, and it's over. From this dvd you would think the Mexicans attacked once, and the Alamo fell. Want to learn about Davey Crockett? He's barely even mentioned. Jim Bowie? The same. Forget about the last stand at the chapel, the line in the sand, heck it doesn't even mention Santa Anna spared the women, children, and the slaves. The reinforcements that made it to the Alamo? Not mentioned either.However, if you do want to learn a different perspective on the Alamo, this isn't a bad dvd. It focuses exclusively on the contributions of the Tejanos to the independence of Texas."
4,Enjoyable,"Like everyone else here, I enjoyed the book. But one must question its accuracy when the writer consistantly refers to ""the five wounds of christ"" as hands, feet and side. That's three wounds. The five wounds of Christ are hands, feet, side, crown of thorns and scourging. One does not count each hand. To do so would indicate that one having a mark on one hand may have stigmata. Not true. One must have the mark on both hands to have what is considered one wound of Christ."
4,Who wanta some wang,"Now I didn't buy this product, but I did get it off the back of a truck from some guy named Habib. I didn't think it would be a good deal for only five bucks. But man! This thing works wonderfully. Definitly begin to start to commence considering buying this baby. It is great if you like it, but not good if you don't."
5,The Isley Brothers Are BANGIN'!,"I'm only 13 but I gotta say that the Isley Brothers are the best old school R&B band still out today. Their songs have been an inspiration in my life. I can't get through the day without listening to at least on of their hits. Their songs have funk and invigorating rhtyhm. Buy this CD because it is da bomb! ""Choosey Lover"" is the definite hit!"
4,excellent,"George Russell was a jazz arranger who later got into free jazz and eletronics: check outELECTRONIC SONATA FOR SOULS LOVED BY NATURE.In 1958, though, he made this terrific album with stars like Bill Evans, Max Roach, and John Coltrane. New York New York is a swing portrait of the big apple as the jazz capitol of the world. It does include some standards, reworked by Russel, as well as his fine, progressive swing compositions.Russell is not well known, and more jazz people should get hip to George. He was flexible enough to work in many genres, experimenting liberally, as jazz grew. If Russell has a stamp, it is his work's ability to convey a sense of time, place and mood for his chosen subject.Check George Russell out. This would be a great start."
4,Taste-Time-Health,"Keywords of this approach. Recipes mostly deliver these intended three, although for some the short time might cause some problems. Must be organized with ingredients and prep and know techniques ahead of time.Organized by season, with full menu, usually entree, accompanying dish and dessert, typically three-course. Great results with these: The Turkey Cutlet Caper, A Rea; Snappy Supper, and a Southern Porch Supper."
3,Truly uneven work of fiction,"The reviews here ruin any surprise as to whether Sarah finds her birth mother. Instead this work's charm lies in how much the reader can emotionally invest in Sarah, the adoptee searching for Kyung Sook, her birth mother. That's a shame because Sarah continually underwhelms. She is as awkward as Lee Fiora in Prep, without the clear, astute observations that made Prep a satisfying read. Surprisingly this book's strength comes from the background story of birth mother Kyung-Sook. She is much more compelling in telling her story. Sarah, however, reveals little about herself that is charming, nuanced or self-aware. Unless you are a stalwart supporter of As-Am lit or very interested in adoptive lit then I suggest you pass on this one."
5,A must read for anyone with an internationally adopted child,"Having spent a year in Korea as a military nurse, then adopting a child from China several years later, this book was incredibly powerful for me. Ms. Lee does an exceptional job of creating an accurate multi-sensorial picture of the Korea I remember, as well as developing believable characters. Unable to put the book down, I was mesmerized by the story and feelings of Kyung-Sook, the birth mother, and Sarah's journey to find her. This is a great book, one that I will recommend to all my ""reader"" friends. Enjoy!"
5,A story that should be read worldwide,"This is not only great storytelling, a great novel, but it explores a theme that resonates with readers in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China and Vietnam, where many cross-racial adoptions have been taking place since the 1950s. It's a uniquely American story, but it's also uniquely Asian in its own way. I'd love to see this become a movie someday, something Hollywood could do real well. Lights! Camera! Action!"
2,hard to fly,"I don't know how I seemingly had such a different experience as the other reviewers. I'm a normal kite buyer as far as I know. I've flown kites as a kid, and I bought one to fly with my daughter. We had another older kite that broke and bought this one as a replacement, I'm no expert, but I did all the normal things one does to fly a kite, ran into the wind, had a one of us hold the kite 20 yards down wind and threw it up into the air. We've tried in low and relatively high wind conditions, and it was always easy to get started, but we were never able to get it to stay in the air. In low wind, it would just drop once you stopped running, in higher wind, it would zig and zag all over the place and eventually nose dive to the ground. Like I said, we've had fine luck with the older kite we had previously, but after 3+ tries with this one, I'm back on Amazon looking for a kite that's easier to fly."
5,excellent kite,Years ago I bought same kite at the museum store of Air and Space Museum in DC. However this one is fraction of the price and perfoms similarly.I especially love the fact that this design folds into a small size. Stays with me in my car all the time. you never know when you'll need a little fun :)
5,A singular album,"I've found that this is one of the albums I listen to on a regular basis. It may be because it's alphabetically near the top of my playlist, but there's definitely more to it than that. Put simply, this is quite unlike any other vocal album I've encountered, thanks to the backing of Gerry Mulligan's famous piano-less combo. No piano, no strings. Just one human voice among several instrumental ones plus rhythm, which makes for surprisingly interesting harmony. Annie Ross is remarkable as well. She sings with characteristic frankness and personality.The tempos for most of the songs are comfortably laid-back, which allow Ross and Mulligan to interplay quite elegantly. They are joined by the trumpet of Chet Baker or Art Farmer, the bass of Bill Crow or Henry Grimes, and the drumming of Dave Bailey. The recording quality could be better -- Ross at times sounds slightly echo-y -- but it doesn't detract from enjoying the music. This is one of my favorite albums to relax to."
3,Okay is the best i can do,i have been a follower of Annie Ross for many years and have some fine recordings of hers but this CD shows that she is past her best and i was disappointed in her vocal contribution to this CD.Mulligan on the other hand was as good as ever and in my opinion has yet to make a poor recording
2,"I agree with BooLab, these things are a joke!","I'll probably also get 1 out of 11 helpful ratings from all the Sonic Impact PR folks shilling on this page, heh heh...People, don't fall for all these cutesy gimmicks. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you are simply sacrificing sound quality for a novel gimmicky form factor, and at these Walmart prices it means a HUGE sacrifice in sound.I listened to one of these at a local shop and it was enough to make me cringe.Godawful!Stick to a simple 2.0 or 2.1 self-powered computer speaker system by Logitech, Altec Lansing or Klipsch from forty to a hundred and forty bucks and you'll be fine!"
1,Bad customer service,I ordered this book and realized the day after I placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself. When I emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason I got no response. I sent another email 2 days later and I still never received a response. I then got the book (which I'm stuck with) and not even in good condition! BAD EXPERIENCE.
2,Where's the art?,"Another book that seems to carry the tag ""the art of"" but not have any real art. As a aspiring cg, digital artist going to school I look to these books for direction ideas and examples but there where none in this book."
2,Poor insight into the film.,"Absolutely pales in comparison with similar books that came out in the 80s such as the Star Wars sketchbooks. After reading this sycophantic gloss, you'll actually feel like more of a groveling Batman groupie; Mark Cotta Vaz excels at superficialities while denying the reader true criticism. Simply, there is little understanding of the artistic mind and what we have here is nothing much more than 50 or so production pieces of art, most of which do not differ from the final product to any appreciable degree.For instance, a little foam-rubber mock-up of the Batmobile takes up an entire page. Also, Cotta Vaz thinks a quote from Nolan such as ""Gotham City is like New York on steroids"" is a revealing statement. I give one star for a smattering of info. regarding various props and the reasoning behind them. But even this is something akin to a DK ""Visual Guide"" not an exploration of a film's artistry."
2,Its no episode 3 art book........,"I got this book expecting it to have many concept drawings such as the the star wars concept books, and with that in mind, i was throughly dissapointed to find it was nothing like that. it was more so the making of the movie and shots of car sculpts. It does have alot of info about the making of the movie, so if your into that, this book is for you, if your into concept, stay away...."
2,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Not only does it include very few of the conceptual design artworks from the movie, some of the artworks are displayed in the whole page that you can't help but wondering, did they run out of photos, pictures when composing this book? Also, without the inclusion of the film's script (which they published as a stand-alone scriptbook) I feel like I've been ripped off my money. I hope the Art of the Dark Knight book doesn't suck like this one."
3,not 48 inches,"I'm not sure how they measure the length, but this was much shorter than the true 48 inch connecter it replaced. Maybe they include the length of the 3 fittings in the bag? With the range pulled out, with the back in line with the cabinet fronts, this connector was pulled nice and tight and had little room for sliding the range right or left. The bag was marked 48"" but I'd say this was more like a 36""."
1,This book lacks substance,This book needs a new revision. The content and format are OK but I don't think they did a good job of matching up with the exam requirements. This book will not be your only resource if you are to pass this exam the first time. Also remember that the quetions in the bok are not representative of the exam. The probem is that there are not a lot of great resources for this exam but you should consider a different one because this one will leave a lot of unanswered questions.
2,Adequate,"This book contains fewer typos and outright inaccuracies than does its Win2000 Professional counterpart; however, the accompanying ""exam prep"" cd contains plenty of each. This book is written for a more novice level than most IT professionals would care to read, while the discrepancies between the book and the cd would certainly frustrate even the most patient novice. I recommend this book to anyone who can get it for free and doesn't mind using the Microsoft TechNet site to look up the answers to the discrepancies which NewRiders thoughtfully includes with no additional charge."
3,Not bad but some things missing,This book series like always has a good hands on feature where you can do exercises and learn the material. However in this book they go a bit too far. They devote step by step exercises during the chapters and at the end of the chapters repeat some of them. A lot of material is irrelevant and they exclude important topics like GPO policies and active directory specifics which are needed for the w2k server environment. The questions and explanations at the end of the chapters are pretty good but the 50 or so questions on the Preplogic demo aren't that good. Overall it will help you pass but i had to do further research on some topics at microsoft.com.
2,Quite a number of topics are missing,"I appreciate the step to step guide for most of the examples. However, it ends up wasting too many pages. The book gives a general discussion on almost all of the topics. There aren't much detailed/technical discussion. I end up heading to Microsoft Technet for more details.I went to the exam and found out that certain topics are not covered in the book at all like Active directory, OU. I barely passed the exam."
3,The Future of Brands : Twenty-Five Visions.,This is a must read for anyone interested in the explosive growth of the future markets. It's not just informative but visonary.
1,The worst OS there is!!!!,I got this vista upgrade the other day. I was really excited about this upgrade. When i was done downloading it. The desktop came up and I WAS JUST LIKE XP BUT THE ICONS WHERE BIGGER AND IT HAD A COOL BACKROUND. I was bot able to get internet connection because my wireless modem wasn't compadable for vista. Also i didn't have the 3-d compadablittiy. I also have a vista capable sticker and i guess.... I had to reformat my comp. for xp. I was on the phone with this indian guy for 3 HOURS!!!!Bottom line: WORST UPGRADE AND OS SYSTEM EVER!!!
3,XPS was a disappointment,"This isn't a review of everything in Vista!The Financial Times says Vista has two really big new features: an unbreakable security kernel, and a new document format, XPS, touted as a big threat to pdf. They said the security kernel will be.. changed? weakened? as a result of EU legal pressure. But I tried XPS today, because I badly need better compression than the awful adobe version 4 my division just got with its copier. Adobe 4 gave 5+ megabytes for a 35 page scanned document! I read it in, ""printed"" it out as XPS, using the only instructions I could find on the MS XPS web site. Result: no reduction in size, but huge reduction in quality! (By comparison, Adobe 7 would give much better cmpression for scanned images, when I tried it at home; CVISION and Adobe Image Capture beter yet.) I hope there will be better news in the future... but this is now..."
1,Do Not buy this crap,This is not Windows Vista this is a Program Upgrade intended for people who are stupid enough to buy a product they do not need. This product is completely useless . I cannot Stress enough that you do not buy this product. I received my First computer in 1984 and have had a vast amount of experience with programming software this is not for anyone.
1,The worst operating system Microsoft has come up with,"this is the worst operating system Microsoft has come up with. Take my word, don't waste your money, this system has too many failures, doesn't work properly and if your computer is not a state-of-the-art, would make it slower and give you trouble. Better stay with XP one that really works!"
3,New Operating System,Installation was difficult but everything is working well enough after a week of use. I still have some problems with this new operating system but perhaps I will figure it out over time.
1,Ruined my alienware. waste of time and money.,"Do not waste your money or your time with this product. lemon laws should apply here. I bought the item at Target, Sacramento. They would not refund my money - and would only do a product exchange. They had a bin behind the exchange counter dedicated to returned Windows Vista.Buyer beware."
1,THIS SHOULD BE CRIMINIAL,Microsoft does it a gain. Sell a product that doesn't work. I had to format hard drive to get XP reinstalled. 1 star is to high of a rating for this product. If I didn't have two new systems I would by a MAC. I am done with MS and their monoply.
3,Wait!,If I had to do it over again I'd have waited 6 month's to a year so that venders can get up to speed on the Vista operating system. Lots of programs don't work yet and lots of others needed new drivers downloaded.
1,technical foul,I can't use this because I had WIN XP PRO..I would have to erase ALL Files and do a CLEAN or COMPLETE install...Nice bit of engineering..I had to go all the way to ULTIMATE just to keep my files...Upgrades are difficult with this new OS..
1,Vista is a terrible offering,"I am a Microsoft Certified Professional and have been using Windows operating system all the way back to Windows 1.0.Vista, bar none, is the worst experience I have ever been made to suffer. Recently bought software stops working, hardware and peripherals that worked OK with XP now don't.Fax which worked with XP Home Edition no longer works with Home Premium. Microsoft has taken away something that I had, paid for and I feel this outright stealing! I feel the term UPGRADE should be just that.Linux and Apple are looking better."
1,Junk software,"I bougt a Vista ready laptop with 2 gb memory and dual core processors. It continuously locks up, sound doesn't play, the wireless software is crap, etc. I am going back to XP until Vista can figure out its problems."
3,The Vista challenge,"As with most all purchases from Amazon, the service was great! Now as to the product itself, the information on the package is a bit deceiving. The UPGRADE statement is only true IF you have Windows XP Home version on the computer. Once installed, the product seems a bit more difficult to use with significant changes to basic tasks. The graphics are GREAT! and the multimedia functions will be very useful. The RAM and vidoe card requirements are right on."
2,Why was I stupid?,"I really thought my laptop would love Vista, but the premium upgrade took exception to Windows XP professional (a lot of machines have this so why did Microsoft not provide a migration path without having to buy an even more expensive Vista upgrade package?) As a result the upgrade jammed, I thought I had lost everything on the machine, and now I have to choose my old Windows XP everytime I switch on. I will ignore Vista until it is next computer buying time.Geoffrey Rivett"
1,I should've waited....,I waited anxiously for the release of Windows Vista and now I releaze I should have waited. I own a 3 month old Dell notebook that worked fine up until I installed Windows Vista on Tuesday. Now I'm having all kinds of program issues; especially with iTunes and my iPod 30G...seems they don't get along very well. Why all these software conflicts?!?!! It's so damn frustrating for a company like Microsoft to release such a shoddy OS! They've had 5 years to perfect it. Take it from me...WAIT until you buy a new computer or they fix the glitches.
1,Beware of Microsoft Windows Vista,"Rendered several good software programs useless; Nero, Band in a Box, Real Recorder and Real Flight. After numerous attempts to remove Vista, finally brought out a spare computer and started using XP again.LarryTrussville AL"
2,too many drivers missing,"I like Microsoft, but Vista makes the use of my computer so limited. I use 2 computers one with XP and one with Vista. I try to put everything on the Vista computer, but now have 4 programs that won't work on Vista and therefore I need 2 computers on my desk. I would immediately go back to XP on this computer, but right now I don't have the time. Until drivers are updated on more programs I recommend using XP"
1,Vista sucks,"I bought a new computer in January of 07 it was made compatible for Vista but the program wisent out yet; I was excited to get it when it came out. I bought it and installed it and have had nothing but problems, the printers I have are not compatible with it the office programs I have don't work correctly, my external back up hard drive doesn't work correctly either, none of the items people have now are compatible with Vista, so unless you want to spend a Lot of money I would jut stay with Windows XP it was a great operating system, Vista has changed the way of saving files and looking up files and have security issues, when you want to delete something it will ask you if your sure, you say yes and it you ask you again if your sure, I don't under stand why windows thinks you should do every thing twice, I have a computer to make my life easer not more complicated."
2,"If it comes with a new computer ok, DON'T UPGRADE TO VISTA","Vista feels good and looks good. If it comes with a new computer go for it. If you are an XP user stay with XP until your computer dies. If you have lots of time to spare, money to buy updates for your existing software, money for more memory, money for a larger hard drive... then go for it. To get Vista to work I had to do a clean install, then reinstall all my programs. Pc-cillian, the recommended Virus checker mucked things up so another clean install this time using AVG, an excellent virus checker. A couple of my photo editing programs, Photoshop Elements and Picasa had issues with Vista and my HP Slide scanner would not work, driver issues. Then.. Vista's Windows Media Player, forget it. Use WinAmp, an excellent media player. My D-link media server would not work with Vista, firewall issues between my wireless router and Vista. I reinstalled XP with AVG virus and I'm back in business."
1,The worst I have ever seen!,"Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP."
3,Don't do it now! Wait,"I just upgraded to Vista Home Premium addition. The upgrade process actually went pretty smooth. It was afterwards that I had issues. It is amazing to me that so many software venders have not updated their software to work with Vista after Vista was 5 years in the making and then delayed their release date! I had to spend $250 for a memory upgrade, I had to buy a new ethernet card because linksys had not written a driver for Vista, and I get constant popups from Vista saying that Norten Antivirus software is not compatible, I also get other error messages relating to HP software for my printer. I have spent 2 full days haseling with these problems. And honestly, the look and functionaliy is not much different from Windows XP. The real difference is in the security area. It really makes you think about the new Mac TV commericals having a point."
4,Read The Negative Vista Reviews With A Grain Of Salt,"There are a lot of fanatical haters of Microsoft and its products. For some reason Linux geeks and Apple Mac enthusiasts love to attack Microsoft. You see this hateful behavior where ever Microsoft products are reviewed. You even find hateful attacks on Microsoft on the financial boards at sites like Yahoo. My evaluation of Vista Home Premium is that it's a pretty good Operating System but there will be some issues with device drivers on older machines. Vista also requires a lot more horsepower, a dual core processor and a minimum of 2 gigs of RAM. The OS is very stable with good security features. The graphics are particularly nice. However, I see no compelling reason to upgrade from Windows XP at this early stage. I would wait about a year and then simply buy a new computer with Vista already preinstalled. That's my honest evaluation. (Expect to see negative comments and ratings about my review from the same people that attack Microsoft)."
3,Licensing,"Im somewhat disappointed in this product, not in the actual product itself but the licensing terms behind it are too constricting. Once you install this version of windows on your computer you cannot install it again on another computer. It costs $50 to buy an extra license and for families it gets quiet expensive. All I wanted to to is put vista on my main computer and laptop and to charge an extra $50 just so I can use a product I already bought on 2 computers seems outrageous. Also the upgrade version involves you having a previous version of windows on your computer before installation which also seems idiotic considering installing a new OS is better with a clean install so it will run smoother. If I were windows I would have given 3 serials per box just so people with multiple computers can install, if Microsoft still thinks each household only has one computer theyre sadly mistaken and im sure not going to buy extra licenses for a product I should already own."
1,Vista will ruin your life,"If you buy a new computer with Vista, go ahead and also buy a copy of XP, format your drive, and install XP. Or better yet, just throw the computer out the window or have someone bash you to death with it, it will be less painful. The computer that can run Vista fast will not be invented for 100 years. Everything will turn to pain, and you will wish you were dead if you try and use it. And dual boot, don't even think about it.P.S. It does have a decent repartitioning software."
1,Awful Software,"This apparently untested software is not ready for general release.Windows Media Player version 11 (which is now apparently a ""core"" part of the Vista operating system (and is therefore un-uninstallable) crashes both itself and Internet Explorer everytime I run across a web-page that has video on it (which is an increasingly common on most destination web-portals). This is all on brand-new hardware that was sold as ""Vista-ready"". Don't waste your money...or more importantly your time...until a more stable version or bug-fix (service pack) comes out.Tim"
1,"Always liked Microsoft products, until Vista came along","This software should have never been released. It is not ready. Two machines several tries and no luck.Save your money, stick with XP"
1,Upgrade? NOT!,"If you want Vista, buy a new computer. The upgrade is ridiculous, crashes my machine, and the incompatibilities are a mile long. I doubt I will ever get the upgrade to work, and I am a fairly sophisticated computer user.Also, the marketing claims it comes with both 32-bit and 64-bit, which is patently untrue - you have to send away for the 64 bit, which costs an additional $10.Take a pass, buy a new computer in a few years with it pre-installed.Really disappointing"
1,Vista an XP Pro Service pack.,"As far as I'm concerned Microsoft could have made a service pack 3 or 4 for windows XP Pro. Then you could apply the patches needed to run the upgrade. As far as I'm concerned Microsoft is out just to make money. Thats all they care about. Windows XP Pro will be my last windows os, I myself will be changing over to Lenix OS. I can't belive that Microsoft went to all this trouble to make Vista. With all the different versions to boot. People if you want to upgrade to Vista be my guest. Microsoft can have and keep their Vista OS. I am removing mine and reinstalling XP Pro until I do my change over to Lenix OS. I will never purchase a new computer with Vista on it."
2,dont buy this the upgrade disk buy the full verion,i am not bad mouthing window vista at all but what i was saying is to beware of the upgrade becaue of some errors you mite get do a clean install an you should be fine i love the windows products but the this upgrade in not is esay is the upgrades in the past and not for for beginner i got it working after about 4 or 5 tries and many hours
1,Awful.,"Bill gates probably was running short of his multi-billion dollars and needed some extra pocket change. You need special amounts of memory and more money to upgrade to 64 bit. The apple commercials are right. You do need major upgrades to get vista. I went back to xp. I'm done with windows for good.I'm going to sell my computer and go to my macbook. Runs faster, and doesnt need special crap."
1,Mac OSX Beta lite,Again windows tries to catch up to the superior Mac OSX but falls short. Apple was light years ahead of windows when the OSX was released and still proves so.
1,"STAY FAR, FAR, FAAAAAAR AWAY","Please stay away from spending money on this program. It makes you feel like you are a thief... only supports microsoft programs, downloading files is a real pain, if not impossible, it crashes frequently, its heavy on the RAM. Its the worst thing that has happend to computers.The grafics are nice, though, but beware that all you'll get to do is watch the pretty icons, everything else, EVERYTHING is a problem.I have to give it one star, but actually I rate it -5 stars."
1,I want to be compensated...,"for the time i spent screwing around with this useless piece of sofware aprox 49 hours Ive gone back to XP I dont know why I left, it was perfectly fuctional I didnt need specuial graphics to make my life more happier"
1,Vista Train Wreck,"I recently purchased a very high end desktop that came installed with Vista Ultimate. Unbelieveable!New hardware, new software - exactly what does work with this over priced mess?If you buy this disaster, you better enjoy slow performnace and lots of blue-screens of death.Microsoft should offer free ""UPGRADES"" to XP, or ME for that matter.Why isn't there a zero or negative star rating?"
3,Almost Happy,"I purchased the Vista Ultimate Version and it runs great with two exceptions. My GeForce Video card works with no acceleration and no advanced features. NVidea is saying that they will develop drivers in the near future, but I am disappointed that the drivers are not already available. Compatibility Mode is still a joke, only advanced programmers will have any success with that feature. Of all programs, Internet Explorer gives errors and shuts down when attempting to select certain links online. That could be video card related. I do not recommend the upgrade if you have only one PC or you need it for your work or business. There is promise, but there are problems too!"
2,"Not worth the headache, yet.","Vista may be a good upgrade a year down the road, but not yet.Many hardware manufacturers have no drivers for vista.Looks nice on the eyes, but works as slow as windows 95.Will give it another try after its been out a while. But for now I will stick with xp pro. I like speed and stability."
5,Windows Vista Home Premium,"As a matter of fact I purchased this article in order to solve a licence problem. Have to use only serial key to solve my problema. Original OS in my PC was latest edition (Home Premium SP2), remember that this edition is an old version. But no matter happen this is a very usefull operative system despite what a lot o users says. My PC is a not expensive clone made by myself operating excellent."
1,Vista home premium,Vista home premium that I have received from you the CD did not match the product to key number .
4,Windows Vista Upgrade,"This was easy to install and did not take too long. Vista takes some getting used to, but after using it for awhile I have found that I prefer it over Windows XP, it is easier to use. It has some new annoying features, but overall, it is easy to use."
1,hard to see any benefits,"Incredibly disappointed. I was happy with XP, now that I'm on Vista I've had to get accustomed all over again with operating a computer. This includes learning how to uninstall programs, navigate folders, changing options, and the like, all over again. I'm also using a much upgraded, more recent computer and the speed of powering up, shutting down, opening programs is the same as it was under my older, cheaper computer using XP. In short, I feel like I've spent a lot of money to get exactly what I had before using an older computer and XP, not withstanding the nuisance of familiarising myself with something new all over again. If I could choose again I'd have just stuck with windows XP."
1,Junk,"You can bet those people gaving Vista a good rating here, work for the company. It's a piece of JUNK. If you have a good working XP, or anything else, please don't buy Vista. I bought it a month ago already installed on a good HP computer. I've worked on it from sun-up to sun-down for a month and still, all I've got is a pile of junk. And, it's so slow, that you have to take a coffee break while it's gathering up a program to run. Don't buy their One-Care either. I've owned Windows since ""98"". I'm considering re-installing my old HP/XP. It's still here in the closet."
1,"Just a Beta - Unstable, unreliable, unsecure. Do not buy. KEEP Windows XP","It took me less than a week to have 2 blue screens.Huge compatibility problems with WinXP.Many of the applications I was using with WinXP, do not work properly, so make sure you have Vista drivers for your old webcam, scanner, printer, etc, or you might need to buy new ones.MS Outlook 2002 crashed the system after a few days and sent it into recovery mode, after which Outlook was wiped out and the Norton antivirus did not work anymore.Not only that, WMP11 gets the library corrupted at every reboot, Windows Movie Maker has plenty of bugs.All in all, I deeply regret the upgrade to VistaMicrosoft, this is unacceptable!! Get a SP quick! You can not treat your customers this way!"
2,Not ready for prime time,"Thank god I didn't have to upgrade my own computer with this not ready for prime time OS, instead I used on a text box here at work, where we need to be able to perform tests on different operating systems.I've read many of the complaints others have had with Vista, and thankfully, my needs for the OS are so minimal that I haven't had to struggle with the same kinds of issues others have dealt with. My upgrade went fairly smoothly, although it did take forever.My beef with Vista (other than the sluggish performance, and the fact that I can't figure out what you really get other than a translucent interface) is that after I installed a new audio driver, that Vista keeps removing it, so that the only way to have audio working is to reinstall the driver, and then wait for Windows to uninstall it with no warning at all.How much time and money did MS put into this? Pitiful, pitiful. Even MS apologist/cheerleader, PC Magazine, is starting to admit that this OS is a dog."
1,Absolutely awful,"Vista has ruined my computer life. I have a 3 month-old computer and upgraded from XP. Worst mistake I could have made-nothing is compatible with Vista. Itunes turned into a disaster area, the computer won't recognize my phone and Motorola says a patch is coming ""sometime in 2007"", my printer stopped working, my modem won't work with my router anymore-the list goes on and on. I'm seriously thinking of either switching to Mac or going to XP Professional. I use that at work and it is far more stable than Vista for home."
2,Totally Overrated,"This is just a prettier version of Windows XP--I don't understand what all the hype was about.Microsoft has done a terrible job refining the PC operating system, and that's really unfortunate, because I HATE Macs. As so many other reviewers have said, it's best just to wait until you buy a new computer before upgrading."
1,Nightmare,"Vista has only brought stress to my life. So much does not work.Third party items like eFax do not work. Vista drivers will not be ready for months. I had to buy a new version of Office, 2007, which I am unfamiliar with. I have had to buy a new printer. I work from my computer and have now lost days of billable time. I only upgraded as I had a pirate version of XP, unable to receive updates, even though I have the original disk?!Do not buy Vista yet. Microsoft will make money, but if you work from your pc, you'll lose."
1,ANOTHER horrible Microsoft Product,"The list of problems with Vista is too great to list here, mostly because my blood pressure will rise to the point that my head explodes.know this: most games compatable with XP will NOT run on vista properly.bottom line, STAY WITH XP AS LONG AS YOU CAN!!! or buy an apple..."
5,Wow!,"This is the coolest! Compared to Windows 98, XP was cool but Vista blows both those out of the water. I had Windows XP Home and the upgrade went flawless. Love the 3-D flip and the live taskbar. So far I'm highly impressed."
5,read the negative but gave it a shot,I read all the negative but still gave it a shot. I'm so glad i did!!!! Only had 1 program with conflicts but i never used it anyway. Had it 30 days now no hiccups. Starts great loads fast and there's no way i'd go back
1,Windows,"Had a problem with the Product Key,Could not register this copy of Windows Vista upgrade,Had to exchange it,"
1,Frustrating,It's like having to relearn the whole windows again. A lot of incompatibility issues with my gadgets. Not to mention the bugs by a fellow upgrader. I'll just stick to XP until Micosoft stop supporting it.............. Why is this so complicated?
2,Tiger?,"Is it just me or am I looking at a clone of Mac's Tiger. Their are the widgets, located at the right, and the same feel as a mac, yet its not.Cancel, or Allow?"
3,if you like bling...,"then vista will impress. if you prefer substance, DON'T INSTALL. Fortunately, I like bling on my computer...but sometimes the 'substance' part of me longs for XP again."
1,"Slow, slow, crashing and freezing: Here is Windows Vista Premium","After realising that my old PC running on XP was much faster than my newly purchased Acer Pentium D, with 2GB RAM, I doubled the RAM to 4 GB to ... zero effect. Office 2006 further worsens the scenario as you get mad with the fatal ""ribbon"". If you venture for Windows Vista be ready for a lot of frustration. Better stick to XP as long as possible."
3,Had to replace peripherals,Vista is very different than XP. Everything's in a different place takes some getting used to. Didn't like not being able to download drivers for Vista from HP who said they would NEVER make drivers for my printer or scanner. HP said they were too old (printer's maybe 3 yrs. old). Vista asks permission for access quite a lot. That feature can be annoying. I do love the graphics and some functions are easier. Those Mac commercials on TV about dissing Vista are funny but accurate. I bought it for the high security and that is an excellent feature and worth it to me. I still have a lot to learn about this software and I have to refer to the help section quite a bit.
3,Vista Problems,"I had hoped that MicroSoft would have fixed this problem before they released the final version , but they didn't. I had even reported it to MicroSoft as one of their Beta testers but it still has not been fixed:Even though Microsoft had problems with the Program Compatability Wizard in Release Candidate 1, they failed to fiin the Commercial release of Windows Vista.I am still waiting for Lexmark to release updated drivers so that I can use my printers with Vista, instead of having a partitioned hard drive so that I can save in Vista, copy it to My Documents in Windows XP partition, restart my computer in Wibdows XP and then print it.I do like most of the features in Vista, but this problem with the Compatability Wizard makes it frustrating, as well as time-consuming."
3,Needs a little work on it,I think the product is going to be great but first all the bugs aren't out of it. I had a long lengthy session with Microsoft in getting a printing problem straightened out with them which they finally got corrected for me.
5,Awsome response,The product was received faster than any other item I have ordered from Amazon in the past and worked without any problems.
3,Never Buy....,"I don't mean this in a bad way at all! Customers should never buy a operating system software until the Developer's have ironed out at least the majior problems. When one purchases a newly released operating system product the customer becomes the real true Quaility-Control group for the big Corporations. If you are a novice, beginer, etc. WAIT!!!! For the developer to clean-up the unexpected driver, software compatability problems. Other than that Windows Vista is a wonderful product and after you iron out all the kinks...the Vista product is a wonderful tool for Companies and small businesses, and home use alike. Overall it is a good product."
1,WOW!!! I'm buying a Mac!!!!!,"This was such an incredible pain to install, and then impossible to run. My printer didn't work anymore, my favorite software didn't work anymore, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what benefit I might derive from this if I was even able to fix these problems, so I went back to XP. My next computer will not run Windows of any description - I'm done with Microsoft."
1,Hate is a strong word...But if the shoe fits...,"Man this program is a total nightmare. Stick with XP. The system freezes up and crashes often. Good luck finding drivers that will actually work for your printer, scanner, and digital camera. Some of my older software is not even accepted by the system. The pre-installed internet explorer 7 is insane too and you don't even have the chance of installing version 6. I tried solve this by installing Mozilla Firefox, but Vista makes it difficult to do this as well. I am no computer expert. I just want to surf the internet and be able to print things from time to time. I DON'T want to spend my time finding millions of new drivers and patches for a system that should NOT have never been released until the bugs were worked out!!!! Thanks Microsoft..."
1,My new laptop is now the buggiest computer I've ever owned!,"I'd just like to point just like to point out to the people having trouble with vista after upgrading their computers: I bought a laptop with vista pre-installed, and I'm having the same problems as you, quite possibly worse. Vista is slow, frustratingly dumbed down, and riddled with bugs. Hopefully there's a download coming out to fix some of this, but right now I'm longing for xp or a mac."
3,Good but wouldn't say ready.,"Dual booting vista at the moment. It's alright, if you luckily have the drivers for everything. For me it seemed to have all the motherboard drivers, and didn't even need to use the motherboard disc. Only problem I think everyone will have is that sound problems people will have.Since the new kind of sound vista uses, unless you have high end creative sound card, or a sound card that supports vista well, you won't be able to have surround on.As for 64 bit of vista, wouldn't install. Most drivers won't work for vista, let alone 64 bit vista. Also little note to NVIDIA SLI fans, at the moment there isn't any drivers that suppot it, except for 8800 series owners."
1,Terrible,"Due to a dead laptop, I was essentially forced to get Vista as part of getting a new machine. By far the worst OS experience I've had in years. Buggy, unstable, and adds nothing useful. (Before you buy, look at the list of new features and see if you actually will use any of them. I don't.)Stick with XP, buy a Mac, etc. Even an abacus suddenly seems worth considering."
1,Don't buy it... yet.,"Stupid, stupid, stupid. I usually have a better head on my shoulders and don't rush out and buy the new operating system until it has some of the bugs worked out, I don't know what I was thinking this time. So now I have a beautiful operating system on which none of my programs will run. Talk about frustrating. I guess I'll put this away until they have a version that works. Oh well, live and learn."
1,You'd be better off with an abacus!,"This product is a downgrade from windows 95. I don't care to go into the details because if I have to think about how much heck this Un-Operating System has put me though any longer I'd probably slip into a coma. Lets just say that a computer that once worked with XP now has no sound (if bought TWO new sound cards), no tv tuner, it runs at 1/3d of the speed it used to, and is not able to successfully ad hoc to my laptop.Lets all hope that this un-OS goes the way of Windows ME, or at least gets a Service Pack right away."
1,"A slow, busy, obtrusive operating system","Operating systems should operate efficiently and modestly in the background.Vista wants to make itself the star of the show. With its endless pop-up warnings and status messages, running Vista is like trying to eat in a restaurant where every five minutes the waiter scrapes crumbs off your table and asks you if everything is fine.Vista is slower than XP, it requires more memory and processor speed, and it doesn't run older programs like Acrobat 6. Does this product have any reason to exist other than to improve Microsoft's profit margin?I am uninstalling Vista from my laptop this weekend and replacing it with XP."
2,What the heck is Microsoft doing?,"What a disaster. Wouldn't upgrade and wouldn't work, despite what the Microsoft adviser said. Tech support was amazingly bad. They determined that Vista was not compatible with my AMD Athlon processor (I'm sure AMD will be thrilled to hear this).Microsoft did refund my money, however. I'll give 'em an extra star for that.Now the full version of Vista that came on my new notebook computer is alright. It runs very nice (though takes forever to boot).I'm not sure what is happening at Microsoft. Vista is the worst upgrade they have ever delivered -- and they spent billions developing it. I just don't know."
2,UPGRADE could really be a DOWNGRADE,"I checked online that my HP computer was compatible with the Vista Upgrade and decided to go for it. The upgrade install itself went smoothly. Now, I have a machine that works but usually has to be shut down by on-off switch - the shut-down choice leaves my machine ""shutting down"" all night. The screen savers don't work (I had screen savers with Windows XP - I think Vista doesn't like my video card), none of my Roxio software works (including Media Creator 9 which says it works with Vista), the new Aero feature doesn't work (I think Vista still doesn't like my video card), and web sites like Amazon and Barnes & Noble that used to happily let me listen to music clips can no longer find my Windows Media Player. The Vista Windows gadgets are a plus but the rest of my experience rates the UPGRADE to Vista as a DOWNGRADE in my computer's functionality."
2,Wait if you can,If you will be purchasing a computer in the next year I would recommend that you wait to buy Vista. Purchase your next pc with it installed and you may save yourself a lot of aggrevation and head aches. My installation was horrific and made my other PC unusable for many hours and many hours of my time to get working.
3,returned couldn't use,I couldn't load it on the computer. I needed to get the Ultimate version.so this was returned.
3,IF XP works don't bother yet.,"I thought that since Vista came out that I needed to have it for my laptops. Well, I guess I should've waited. It doesn't work that much better as of yet, in fact some of my old software doesn't work not to mention not all manufacturers have drivers for their hardware yet, very disturbing. I suggest that if you haven't spent the money yet, to wait until all the bugs are worked out and the hardware drivers are available."
5,I also used this book as an undergrad...,"and it's terrific. Dr. DeSerpa presents a complex topic in way that blends the basics of economics with ""real world"" applications. Most importantly, I still use what I gained from DeSerpa's curriculum. This book is definitely a must have for econ students and anyone interested in the subject of law and economics.Sincerely,James D. RayNew York, NY"
5,Historical Washington DC -- A Primer,"As a child growing up in Washington DC, I had the privilege of meeting Bryson Rash at the old WMAL Studios at Military Road & Connecticut Ave NW during his ""Tailwaggers"" show. At that time in the late '40's early 50's, he would launch into one of his historical anecdotes which would leave even jaded native Washingtonians in bewildered awe.This book is pure gold! No amount of mentoring or preparation for the DC Tour Guide licensing credentials would ever reveal the pearls contained within in its covers.For those with any interest at all in the wonderful stories associated with this town outside of mainstream tourism, this volume is a must! Enjoy."
1,Let off some steam Bennett!,"Working at a bookstore, one gets to see all the really nifty right-wing books that come in, books from the insatiable Ann Coulter to the rotund William Bennett. Of course, these books are prominently displayed, as the right-wing will go into hysterics if they were not and cry ""LIBERAL CABAL!!!""The Gambler Bennett, well, he's broke even with his new manual on how to convince the world on the need to end moral decline once and for all in the United States, especially after the wretched events of 9/11. And of course, The Gambler has all the answers to our problems. But, as Spencer Tracy says to Fredric March in the classic 1960 film ""Inherit The Wind"", ""It's a shame we don't all possess your positive knowledge of what is right and what is wrong, Mr. Brady."""
1,Why fight? The Lies. The Lies.,"Don't be ridiculous.So The Chickenhaw-in-Chief can get re-elected.So Morals Czar Bennett has enough money to wager in Las Vegas while he lifts his nose longingly at the half-naked women.So people like Rush Limbaugh can moralize while blowing enough prescription powder up his nose that if it were concrete, you could replace the World Trade Center -- although it would wobble like the big fat idio.If you want some moralizing, get them from someone who isn't a two-fisted masturbating phony. Oh yeah, then keep it to yourself.Anyone who gives this book more than one star obviously can't read or suffers from a form of mental disease."
1,"""Moral Clarity"" from a draft dodging gambling addict",Do I really need lectures on morals from this clown. The only thing you're doing by buying this trash is supporting the casinos in Vegas.
2,Bennett has lost all credibility,The ethics guru is teaching us all to gamble and lose millions of dollars. DO not waste your time on this hypocrite!
1,Why We Wight,"You Bennett fans...don't you ever get tired of the way he lies?He says W. spoke ""eloquently and compellingly"" on Sept. 11. You know, we all know, that that just isn't true. W. stuttered like a child and ran like a coward, after the attacks. My soldier friends, who aren't exactly leftwingers, were so disgusted they still won't even mention W.'s name.He talks about ""the President"" as if the office conferred a halo on its occupant--but when he mentions Clinton, the grand dignity of the office somehow vanishes.He says ""Fundamentalist Christians don't seek power""; that's a lie which can be refuted by a simple list of names: Falwell, Robertson, Graham....He asks ""Why do they hate us?"" and then says it's ""irrelevant."" Well no, it's not irrelevant--not with Manhattan in ruinsI'm trying to believe you people have some decency in you, but it's difficult, when you swallow such obvious lies and say, ""Delicious!"" It's hard to believe you're being honest, when your reaction itself must be a lie."
1,"What do you mean ""We"" Mr. Bennett.","If there is one thing I can not stand it is arm-chair generals like Mr. Bennett. How goes on and on about war and his opinions about how to win a war, yet this man never served in the military. In the end, his idea of morality and war in this: I support war, just as long as I don't have to fight. Opinions like Mr. Bennett's make me think that it is time this country had national service so rantings like these would be tempered by reality."
5,"Clear, Lucid, Inspirational","As usual, Mr. Bennett brings his clearly-written, lucid style to a topic that should be required reading in all American civics classes (do these still exist?).The force of the man's arguments as to why we fight are right-on and powerful. He does not argue for a lock-step state that supresses criticism but rather for a reaffirmation of the values and ideals of what makes this great country worth fighting for.The premise is this: If every citizen had a clear understanding of what this country is about, especially when compared to all the other nations of the world, there would be no need for this book. Criticism of our government is, indeed, a hallowed right for Americans, but knee-jerk Anti-Americanism that runs counter to all logic and common sense is just downright stupid...."
1,narrow minded dogmatisim,"There are a few good points made in the book. But a lot of this tome is an angry, narrow-minded diatribe against independent thinking. Yes, these so-called Muslim fundamentalists (they are terrorists, not Muslims) that attacked America are a true threat, but so are dangerous ""intellectuals"" like Bill Bennett who would happily trash the Constitution to get all terrorists and free-thinkers locked up, to boot. We need to work together to protect America; William Bennett`s book shows that he has no real idea what American freedom really is, or why we fight to protect it. Read this book to get an idea of how fascism begins, and then go pick up The Nation magazine for a glimpse of REAL patriotism."
1,Nations don't have morals - they only have interests!,I don't see where morality comes into the picture at all. Politicians and nations only have interests - no friends.Where is the moral clarity when you talk about Israel for instance? Or Pakistan? Or China?Mr.Bennett is either really naive or pretending to be. Either way this book is a shoddily written hastily put together riff-raff of nothing in particular. I would hardly recommend it to a college student except as an example of how and what not to write!
1,This book is terrible,"I was reading a debate between Noam Chomsky and William Bennet on their new books, so I decided to buy them both. I won't review Mr. Chomsky's book here, but Mr. Bennet's book is terrible. I thought it was bad enough to actually write a review so other people do not buy this book. The message is basically, if you love your country, agree and support what your government does."
1,"Very, very sad","Bennett's own logic undermines itself. He is in essence arguing that to be a truly patriotic American, one must check your brains in at the door and unquestioningly accept everything our government tells us. Welcome to the machine.Our country was founded on the premise that individuals should have the capability to think for themselves and critique those in power. It's time that we rediscovered that to appropriately confront those in power is true American patriotism."
1,What drivel....,"Well, what can one expect from a guy who once berated a kid from a podium for wearing a Bart Simpson shirt.What I don't quite get, though, is why Bennett wrote this? Is he looking to whip the rabid conservatives into a complete frenzy by showing them the true nature of those evil lefties? Reminds me of the way terrorist leaders recruit suicide bombers.I recently discovered that Dr. Bennett got his Bachelors degree from my alma mater, Williams College. As I remember, Williams had always had a very powerful pluralistic tradition (""moral relativism"", Bennett calls it). I am rather ashamed that it produced such a self-righteous, hypocritical whiner as Dr. Bennett. It also seems that English 101 wasn't quite as good back then. Otherwise, the professors might have taught Bennett that phrases like ""superior goodness"" and ""fake facade"" are not exactly the best of English. But I guess a person talking about moral clarity can't be criticized, 'cause criticism is un-American, as we all know."
4,More preaching of moral clarity from the morally confused...,"By getting this from a local library, you can avoid indirectly contributing to your local casino and thus assisting the American moral decline Mr. Bennett so greatly abhors. As a high-stakes player of the type who would make the late John Gotti blush, we can easily determine why he is so gung-ho for a bloody, global war against ""radical Islam"". A war that, in the mind of Mr. Bennett, includes even non-radical Muslim countries somewhat friendly to the US (i.e. Egypt). Numerous verses in the Koran decry gambling as the work of Satan, and it is expressly prohibited in many (if not all) Islamic countries."
5,The Short Version And The Complete Story,"William J. Bennett has produced another thoughtful and intelligent work. It's his answer to why we fight -- the short version. I will simply say that, before you jump to conclusions one way or the other, read ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson"" by Norman Thomas Remick to bring why we fight into clear focus --- the complete story."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This item is not what you think it is! It's from way back in 1995, which is a technological ice age ago. It requires a 40 pin SCSI cable to run (which is tricky for the average non-IT person to install). It requires special software to run it, and it doesn't scan to PDF. Yes, that's right, no PDFs. I am in the process of returning one I just bought and I cannot tell you how disappointed we were in it. The one we bought had other issues, though, like falling apart and not working due to mechanical issues. This one may be in perfect working order, but just know what you are getting into. Buyer beware."
2,Sadly Superficial Stan,"Yep, I'm a big fan of Silver Age Marvel comics and yep, I'm a big fan of Stan himself - his liberal humanist philosophy, his corny sense of humour and his frequent self-deprecation.However, the problem with this autobiography is that it doesn't shed any further light on Stan beyond what you knew from reading his Soapbox. He's just the kind of guy you expected him to be, but he's giving away scant insight into his life beyond the bare facts. There's little self-examination in these 200 pages and what little there is reads like Peter Parker thought bubbles. The ""amazing"" ups and downs of Stan's life seem to have caused no mental struggle or anguish and the rumours of feuds with Kirby and Ditko are dismissed in a couple of paragraphs. Apparently Stan didn't know they were upset!All in all, more a coffee table book or an extended self-promotional essay rather than a genuine autobiography."
4,A fun read...,"This is not an in-depth self analysis of the man and mind behind Marvel Comics. Rather, it is a light and fun journey through the life and times of one Mr. Stan 'The Man' Lee. I enjoyed it quite a bit. And I think most people who grew up on Marvel Comics, who also don't expect loads of controversial dialogue and introspection, will dig it too!"
4,The King of Comics,"Like the Hulk and Spider-manRead about their creator Stan!If you are a comic fan,reading this should be your plan!Buy it as quickly as ypi can-you'll agree that Stan's the Man!"
2,"I love Stan Lee, but not this...","I am not a Stan-hater. Yes I love Kirby & Ditko, & probably wouldn't read comics if not for cool art. But Stan is a legend, & if his writing looks corny now, remember, he was writing primarily for 8 to 13-yr-olds, until Marvel caught on in high schools & colleges. I probably learned (or wanted to learn) to read from Stan's writing in the FF & Spider-Man. That being said, this book is soooo boring. No real details, just a vague remembrance of his life. What is not said is often more interesting to speculate on. His co-writer/editor is a relentless yes-man. No, I didn't want to hear any anti-Stan tirades, but some balance would have been nice. Quotes from his collaborators & competitors would've been good too. I'm sure there is a great, more objective book about Stan Lee (& I'd like to read it), with liberal quotes from him, but this book is not it."
5,A Must Read for All Comic Fans,"I could not put this book down. I was a fan of Marvel Comics growing up and have passed on to my son quite a collection of comics. I had read many of Stan's other works regarding comics (Origins of Marvel Comics, Sons of Origins, Bring On the Bad Guys). Each of those books were excellent. However, those books dealt with nothing prior to The Fantastic Four.In this book we learn that Stan had a long career (about 20 years) in the comic book field, Marvel wasn't called Marvel until the 1960's, Stan used to churn out close to 80 titles a month in the 1950's, Stan actually wrote a few books in the 1950's that sold well, and Stan was actually going to quit the trade on the day he was told to create a superhero group (later called the Fantastic Four) for Atlas comics. And those are just of few of tidbits that are contained in this wonderfully written bio/auto bio."
5,Real Ford Motocraft Part,"This was a direct replacement for the oil cap on my 2002 Ford Excursion V10. Even ratchets the same. It comes in a Motocraft box. Same as the dealer sells, but a few dollars cheaper here on Amazon."
4,my little guy loves Godzuki!,"Its pretty small, but I don't think there's another one of these out there. Anyway, my little guy calls him Godzuki from the old cartoon and loves him to death. Good enough for me!"
5,Absolutely fantastic.,"Don't get this book right away if you are a beginner, or want an SQL reference.DO get this book if you want to know the details of SQL Server. If you already know SQL, and if you already have some sort of data structures background, you can learn HOW the product works in order to fully exploit its usefulness.The book doesn't preach about the product, and the writing style is clear and straightforward. I have found the book to be extremely accurate, and I wouldn't say it's a stretch to say that this book is almost the K&R of SQL Server. Analogy is rarely used in the text - this is meant for computing professionals who have a background in the discipline.I found it to be a fascinating and useful book. Ms. Delaney is also active on the SQL Server newsgroups, and has an ""Inside SQL Server"" website on the 'net. The authors really do care about the quality of this book, and it shows. I'm going to buy the next edition as soon as it comes out."
3,Not for 70-029 fast training,"This is a good book if you want a wide, comprehensive, historical and perhaps anecdoctycal point of view of SQL Server 7.0. Don't spend money in this book if you are aiming just to pass the 70-029 exam quickly."
3,"No OLAP Server, No DTS - a let-down.","Trying to get your mind around OLAP Server? Guess we'll have to wait for an OLAP book. MDX? Not even in the index! Will DTS suffice for your ETL problems? No help here. English Query? Nope. These are classified as tools that ship with SQL Server, and when they are mentioned, the reader is pointed towards Books Online.The book appears to be a straight revision of the 6.5 edition - you might get by with that edition and the documentation that ships with SQL Server 7.0.I'd give it five stars for describing the core product in detail - its stated mission - but leaving out the new toys???"
5,The best SQL Server book you can buy,"If you already know the basics and are interested in intelligent database design, this is the book for you. It delves into the internal workings of SQL Server and helps you understand how the program actually stores your data and the factors that could affect database performance. (After reading this book, I was able to redesign my some tables to reduce long-running queries by about 90%.)You can also buy the more recent edition on SQL Server 2000 if you are planning to upgrade soon."
5,The best available,"This is a great book for giving a novice SQL 7 user a detailed understanding of how SQL 7 really works. While not billed as an exam prep guide, this text was absolutely key to getting me past 70-29. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to learn SQL or wants to attain their MCDBA."
5,A must read material for profesional SQL Server developer,"If you are focused on SQL server you must have this. It does not cover everything (for example administration), you can not learn the basics, BUT you will learn architecture details that will clear the fog..."
2,NOT A GOOD BOOK on SQL 7,"I guess that people who gave 5 stars work for microsoft and/or wrote this book...how can anyone otherwise rank this junk so high! As most ""microsof press"" books, this book is no good, it lacks structure, examples are copied from the on-line documentation...authors have no clue towards what audience they're targeting. DON'T BUY! Look for ""IDG"" publications. Peter"
1,One of the worst test preparation guides. Ever.,"Using this book wasted my time (and, of course, my money). This book will likely worsen test day performance since it gives the reader a very mistaken idea about the content of the GSFLT. First, this guide does not give any test-specific information, such as how many sections there are (2), how long the sections are (45 mins and 60 mins) or what will be on the exam (grammar then reading passages). It is merely a big book of standardized-style French questions with answers only (ie A,B,C), but no explanations of correct and incorrect responses. The actual exam focuses on academic French whereas this book has a lot of material covering ""everyday"" French. The editor of this book seems to have compiled the material from preparation materials for other French exams and not the GSFLT."
4,wine bottle glas insert,"I recently bought 2 sets of the wine bottle inserts and tried one the other day.I used La-Tee-Da scented lamp oil ( is more volatile then regular lamp oil )and a little funnel bought at Pier 1 to fill the vial.Careful do not overfill stop about 1/8"" from top !The candle will burn for 2 + hoursI like the inserts because you can turn any bottle short or very long neck into aoil lamp without filling the whole bottle with lampoil."
2,Disappointing,"It wasn't clear to me that you have to pour the lamp oil into the tiny opening at the top of this glass insert. If you don't have a very small funnel you will end up pouring half the lamp oil all over the floor. Lamp oil is expensive and messy. Fill the insert over the sink. I'm not sure what the capacity of the insert is - perhaps 2oz - but it's only enough to burn for about 10 minutes. It's hard to get into the romantic mood if you have to keep refilling your candle with messy, smelly lamp oil every 10 minutes.I was expecting the insert to be open at the bottom and the wick to reach the bottom of the bottle. Then I'd fill the bottle with lamp oil and my candle would burn for several hours. That's not what we're buying here.The stem part is 5"" long. If you have a short wine bottle, maybe 6"" tall, you could carefully knock off the bottom with a hammer and you'd have a decent candle. None of my wine bottles are that short - not even the port.I don't recommend this product."
4,The Long and Living Shadow by Daoma Winston,"Description from the book back cover:Having been married four years, twenty-three-year-old Marion Mayfield had just returned to her childhood home after the death of her fifty-five-year-old husband. At first she thought that the cryptic note she received was just a prank. Marion was the last of the line, and as such, had inherited a fortune. But there were some who thought she might not be the last surviving family member. Soon the seemingly innocent note became a warning, and later, the words held a threat of danger. Who could be the instigator of this horror? And why?"
5,Just what I needed,I was looking for non-violent games for my kids that they would actually be interested in playing. This fit the bill. It was in great condition and came right on time.
4,"Good, but not that good ...","This Model is a PLAYER/RECORDER with only 10-Second Shock Resistant Memory (when most have 40 sec.), Multi Function Remote Control and 3-Mode Digital X-Bass . It sounds pretty good, but it lacks a good buildquality, that you might expect from SHARP . It looks great and user-friendly, but it's just no IT ... you'd expect from a company like SHARP that it would release a better device that could compete with those of other companies, and most of all - with SONY . Don't get me wrong - I like this MD, and use it alot, but I was kinda disapointed ."
4,How can I use that MD to record from a CD or COM?,"I got it a few days ago. It looks good and I like it. However, I can't record some music from a CD player or a computer. I often download music from some website and I want to record it into a MD disc. There is no fit wire for recording. I am very dispointed about that."
2,Very Safe,"I have put fuel into these cans and cannot return them; so am stuck with them. I purchased several metal fuel cans in assorted sizes for both gas and diesel. What these pictures do not show is it is virtually impossible to put your chosen fuel into these cans. You need at least four hands and maybe more for the larger size cans. After my first time of trying to fill my mower from the one gallon can I realized the assorted safety virtues are there for those people who have no clue. Kind of like the ones who designed the can I suppose, unless the whole idea is if you can't get fuel into the can, you are safe. People whose hands are small have a hard time with these cans, people with large hands may have it easier. I spilled nearly the entire gallon when filling my mower, back to plastic I think. If I ever find an older metal can at a yard sale I will be much happier."
5,easy,"Very easy to keep track of groups and team members, once you get the hang of it it is very simple."
2,Does not work with NB-2LH Canon Rebel XT battery,"I'm not sure if I'm a special case or not, but my battery fits into the charger, and it plugs in and the lights flash and everything, however when I pop the battery back into the camera after a long charge, nothing.To make sure that the problem was the charger not the battery, I tried charging the battery with a friends charger who has the same camera. Voila, no problem.Again, I'm not sure if I have a defective model, and I appreciate the company offering an affordable model, however this turned out not to be a viable option for me."
1,Stewart McDonalds,Well what i am looking for is a book so that I can learn how to build acoustic guitars. I am not familiar with the internet - I just found this so I thought I will give it a try - can somebody help me - I will appreciate it.A real good book for learning how to build acoustic guitars. Thank you
5,Great CD,"This is my second David Wilcox CD, and I love it. It is a well-rounded album, without a bunch of ""filler"" songs surrounding a few good ones. I highly recommend it."
2,Try Elsewhere,"If you're looking for music from David Wilcox (the sensitive singer/songwriter from North Carolina, not the gutbucket bloozman from Canada), you should pick up 2 of the best CD's of the 90's: How Did You Find Me Here and Big Horizon. Wilcox reminds a lot of people of John Gorka but the more apt comparison is to James Taylor. The title track is about the only thing here that equals the best of those albums: an acoustic blues that showcases the singer's butterscotch vocals. ""With your tongue in your ear you say come and I come walking/a glide in my stride/what you whispered well it keeps me satisfied."" Them's lyrics! On the other hand, David should stay away from overt comedy. When he's not trying to hard he can be very funny, but then there's a (rap?) song about Sex and Death which is way off the mark. He's one of the few artists that I used to buy a new release from without even listening to it. But that was then."
5,DORMONT RANGE CONNECTOR,"THIS ITEM WAS A PERFECT FIT, EXTRA CONNECTORS A PLUS. NO KINKS, A PERFECT LENGTH, INSTALLED IN 5 MINUTES! ALTHOUGH LIMITED IN FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE HOSES, BUT HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU MOVE YOUR RANGE!! THE PRICE WAS RIGHT!! THE PACKAGING WAS EXCELLENT, THE EXTRA HARDWARE NEVER MOVED. THANKS FOR THE GREAT DEAL!!"
4,Good Intense Yoga workout,"I have a number of yoga videos, but this is the one I use to work out. Mark has a wonderful intensity and enthusiasm, and the workout is at a high level. Not really for beginners, but very good for anyone who wants to extend their yoga experience. Very nice!"
5,Not to be missed!,"You will be touched by these compelling stories. Peter Laufer reveals some previously unreported tragedies of the Iraq invasion. Unlike the predictable ""collateral damage"" to civilians in the line of fire, the casualties presented in this book are back home -- the families of those who made the difficult, principled decision not to fight and die in another pointless war. Laufer goes into their homes and their hearts and their heads. His thorough journalism shows the awful price one can pay to be a conscientious objector.While most Americans sit comfortably and ignorantly on the outside, Mission Rejected presents a painful insight into the reality of Bush's war. If you ever wondered whether there are parallels between this military adventure and the Vietnam War, here is solid evidence."
1,Ashamed to be in the same uniform,"I am not sure what these soldiers were called to do. It was a difficult road, yes, but it was a war. What people forget is that it is a war in which much good is growing. If these soldiers did not see any beauty, it was their own fault. They were not looking for beauty if they saw none. I walked a lot of the same dirt and endured a lot of heartbreak right along with them, but I would also give my life in a second to provide my new Iraqi friends/family with the possibilty of hope. God Bless and please be careful of what you read. Is the glass half empty or half full to you?"
4,NICE EARRINGS,"After long research, I found the shape of earrings I was looking for. I like them, even if they are a little bit small."
3,Tastes like olives,"These are fun for Bloody Mary drinks, but I expected them to taste unique. Honestly, they taste a lot like olives, which we already put onto our drinks."
1,Huh?,"After reading this book, that was pretty much the thought I was left with.Very weird, loose, writing style, and a lot of content that made me feel like I was missing out on some sort of inside joke (despite being a foreigner who's lived in Japan).I hate giving bad reviews, but I'm glad I bought this used for 300 yen, otherwise I would be annoyed to say the least."
1,cheesy,"Trite, contrived and written in a style popular on message boards all over the internet. This is even worse than that Dave Barry Does Japan fiasco. I was glad I had access to a copy prior to purchase. I'd rather not have any more money go towards this drivel.I've lived in Japan for a number of years myself. The author does a fair job of exploiting a number of stereotypes, both in practice and in writing - think about it.... If you're into that sort of thing, then maybe this is for you."
5,A Real World Financial Thriller by a Real World Practitioner,"Are these the real people who run the world's metals markets? The colourful characters who populate this novel are obviously fictitious, but as close as you're likely to get to the real thing. So too is the plot, a ""how it might have happened"" scenario of the copper scam that rocked the copper market in the nineties and cost Sumitomo billions. And guess what? The rogue trader who manipulated the copper markets at the time gets out of jail shortly. It is refreshing (and informative) to read a financial thriller with an understanding of how the markets really work. If this is prescribed reading for financial traders, then even more so for the regulators, who have to learn to stay a step ahead rather than behind. And then, of course, anyone who enjoys a really good thriller."
5,Great ideas,"This is a great book. If you feel overwhelmed by your clutter and don't know where to start and how to go about cleaning it up, Emilie has some great ideas. For example, for starters, work 1 room at a time and separate things by what to keep, what to get rid of, etc...."
3,Nice ring...but...,Nice...but once you have adjusted I would HIGHLY recommend to bring it to a jeweler and have it soldered. Makes a structurally stronger ring.
4,Pretty good for beginners,"I've been ballroom dancing for over 40 years and bought this disc along with vols. 1 & 2 to brush up on some of the dances that we don't do frequently. If you don't keep dancing, you forget a lot of what used to come naturally. Their specialty seems to be Latin dances - swing is not their forte. The instruction is slow paced and repetitive. All steps from discs 1 and 2 are reviewed in disc 3 and that is all I really needed to buy. The pace is slow and repetitive for experienced dancers, but might be just fine for real beginners. Since they cover so many styles the cd set can't go much beyond the basics. The instruction is pretty clear and the camera shots are good enough to learn the steps."
1,Purely Frustrating,"Save yourself some money. Don't buy this game, because it is too hard to control.I have tried a gamepad, an optical mouse, and a keyboard. Forget it!Maybe they have a keyboard just for the game... similar to a control panel on a jet!On the other hand, the puzzles were designed by ""Special Ed""."
2,Not so hot on WinXP,"I haven't gotten too far with the game yet, because just getting it to run is such a frustrating experience. I can only play it after a fresh reboot because there is something wrong with the copy protection scheme. Searching the web for solutions found nothing except other people with the same problem.The other thing that has been a setback is the fact that it doesn't save my game position. To get used to the somewhat different movement used in this game, I'm practicing in the Manor, but I have to start over from scratch every time I go back. I have not yet had a big enough block of time to get through it all in one shot, but at least I'm getting used to the movement!As for the play experience, so far so good. I'm new to this type of game, so it is still challenging for me to find the keys to the next stage of play. The main reason for my low rating is the DRM problems. DRM should not get in the way of legitimate users!!!!"
3,tomb raider anniversary,"well, the game WAS going fine BUT...at the level of the city of vilabamba...at the large locked door...right side to open that lock was fine BUT LEFT SIDE (after many many tries and hellp from comp savy friends) has been determined that IT'S I BUG in the game!!!!so buying it was wrong and i didn't know that...if the game is exchanged, would there still be that BUG!???? so i'm sorry that i made that purchase...needly to say....what can i do?? any thoughts &/or suggestions???is there a was to by-pass that part of the game???can the bug be cured??....liddiebugm@yahoo.com"
5,much better than the original one...,"i loved the first game, and this is soooo much beter, the graphics are way past awesome! the gameplay is relatively the same as legend. the story is almost the same as the first, which is great. the music is awesome. and overall, i love this game... its absolutely stunning.words can't explain how great this game really is... it's even better then legend... you've got to have a first hand experience at this masterpiece.if you are a long time fan of tomb raider... you must get this perfect game. and no it doesn't have any bugs.oh, and yes it works much much better on vista."
4,A Few Drawbacks,"The occasionally klutzy combat mechanism tends to steal some pleasure from a marvelously executed game. The game is also slightly schizophrenic as it moves from a pleasant story-oriented adventure to an overly precision-oriented button-pushing mechanic. Still, at four stars, compared to most games, TRA is a steal."
3,Pretty scenery doesn't mean a great game,"I haven't been playing many video games lately, but when I read the high praise being given to this game I decided to get it and see if it could bring back some of the enjoyment of old TR games. I will say the graphics are beautiful and Lara's moves aren't so mechanical, but the game play is no better and in many ways inferior to past games. The bulk of game is 3 jumps & a grapple throw - repeated until boring, with the a few switch pulls - never very tricky - pick-ups that are pointed out by glowing orbs, box pushes and a bit of shooting. Highly repetitive and becomes very predictable once you get the feel for it. Sadly the way too short Manor level comes closer to being like TR of old. I guess some fans will argue that any decent game is better than the last two Core versions and maybe I should be happy with what I have, but it seems like a pale imitation compared to the glory days of the '90s"
2,Frustrating!!!!!!!!! >:-(,"I can't stand this game. I played through the first few levels. The graphics are great and the concept is good, but the gameplay is awful! Controling Lara takes time to get used to and even then it's frustrating!"
1,Do not buy if you have a Creative sound card!,"I am sure this is a great game, but do not buy it if you have a Soundblaster sound card or any integrated or aftermarket sound that uses Creative's technology. The game will run but all audio will be glitchy and inaudible. It makes the game unplayable unless you want to just put everything on mute. Until Eidos fixes the issue I cannot recommend this game.Oh, and Legend has the same problem too."
1,Wait for patches: there are still some buggs!,"Argh! I just bought the game, played for 2 hours enjoying the game... I took a break and tried to load my previous game and suddenly I got the error ""Unable to load profile!"". Hum.. some googleing and I realized that many persons were in the same case than I and that the problem has been noticed beginning of June...3 weeks later, Eidos hasn't released a patch yet!! What the heck? Their only answer for now is to overwrite a folder WHILE the game is running! Nice, I'm not playing at the same resolution than my desktop so each time I alt-tab, my icons on my Desktop are getting foobar. Moreover, their ""solution"" does not resolve the problem for the autosave in the manor: all the progress I made seem lost. This is probably an easy patch and I'm very disappointed than Eidos released a game not fully debugged. Advice: wait and see!"
3,Would be perfect without all those bugs,"I loved the first episode of Tomb Raider, so I was kinda pleased to see that they've done a remake of it. The game is beautiful, and it's way more fun to play it than the classic one. Except for the numerous bugs in the game that ruined a bit my gaming experience, especially when you try to finish the game in the time trial mode.Bugs often happen with the bosses of each chapter, for instance the TRex always gets stuck in the landscape. Same for the centaurs in Greece, I had 2 minutes to kill them, which is way enough, but lost my time trial cause one of them was stuck in the temple wall.That's a bit annoying, especially when it's at the end of the level.I had other bugs, like Lara getting stuck between stairs, etc.In that sense, I enjoyed Underworld more than Anniversary :)Still, it's a great game to play. Buy it."
1,Laura Croft fall down,Too many tricks to figure out the game. The author needed to put in a save game button. The author will save the game but where he wants to save the game. Every new site requires a different trick to escape. You need help to complete this game the author gives no clues.
1,Computer games...I don't know...?,"When I purchased 'Tomb Raider Anniversary' for Windows I was really excited, however when I installed it on my computer (Windows XP) my smile turned upside down. The game didn't work properly, it was glitchy, the main menu for the game wouldn't even display. All that was displayed was a blank screen. That's when I thought ok, I'm sticking to game console video games. And it was my first time trying out a PC game too...aswell as my last."
3,anybody know if it works with Windows 7 ????,"I purchased this for pc a couple of months ago - just got around to installing (actually TRYING TO INSTALL) it on my new desktop. It seems to not want to install it. I have selected 'install' several times, and NOTHING happens. Would love to actually play it, I am a big fan of the series, does anybody know if the issue could be that I have 'Windows 7', and not XP or Vista???diamonddave01@hotmail.com"
4,i have none,"I always liked tomb raider games, what I do not like is the Boss levels. I some times can not get pass them."
5,Just what I needed.,"Great product. Just what I was looking for. My backyard tree where I hang my bird feeder has very high branches, and I needed something to bring my feeder down to a decent height. This works perfectly. I still have to stand on a stool to fill the feeder, but at least I don't need a ladder."
1,Very disappointed,By the time the alarm went off I was within sight of police cars. It is very specific; it tells you exactly what is there -but not until you see it at the same time.
4,great cd,"There are few cds I can listen to from beginning to end without getting bored, but I can definitely say all the tracks on this one keep me pumping.If you liked groups like LaBouche, dance remix albums, or the ""house"" synth bass-type music that used to be played in clubs before hip-hop took over, this is a great choice."
1,B -Mores Best?,"You gotta be kidding me....If this is all Baltimore can come with good luck....Album sucks, artwork sucks, Baltimore sucks!"
3,bmore comin out!?,"To be his frist CD Tim is coming strong to the seen, putin bmor on spot..... dont sleep this mans skills..."
1,Not interesting,This video is really not recommended - It is not interesting at all .. I wish I never had bought it. :(
1,misrepresented item,"The item I received was neither a 5 pack, nor Memorex as the photo and the title indicate. Instead it was 2 single Fuji Mini Discs. When I contacted the dealer I was told I should have read the fine print (sellers comments)which clearly stated what I was purchasing. Although the packing slip, email confirmation and origninal listing all matched the photo at Amazon, the items did not. I was told It would cost considerably more to purchase a five pack, which is simply not true. Buyers beware, check the Sellers comments. I don't fault Amazon, but think the sellers comments should not be allowed to contradict both the title and photo of the item up for sale."
5,A Christmas list MUST READ!,I loved THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL--This is by far one of the best series I have ever read-and this book certainly puts the reader in the HOLIDAY SPIRIT!!
5,He still has it...,"Yet again, Thomas Kinkade has delivered. Beautifully, I might add. I still stick with my thought since I've read his first book...this man can tell a story as beautifully as he can paint a picture. Again, I was able to close my eyes and imagine I was there...He does with a story the same as he does with a picture, he brings it to life and makes you want to be there; He does this SO vividly that if you can block out the rest of the world, you ARE in the town of Cape Light. Way to go Thomas Kinkade! Keep up the good work and I can't WAIT for the next one!"
5,Another winner from Thomas Kinkade!,Kinkade continues his wonderful story about the residents of Cape Light. An abandoned baby brings healing to one of the families. I enjoy continuing to get to know the families and Kinkade stays true to the storyline.
5,nawal is not the best,"nawal is the best and we must not included with others she is a miracle she is a yellow diamond so how can we say that she is just number one she is the only staron the ground she is a superstar always shineand with all my love ,buy her cd and you'll found your self in every wonderfull song"
3,I like the original,I like the original story better. This one is shortened and doesn't work quite as well. But the artwork is beautiful.
4,Not Smooth Jazz,"All jazz is not created with equal intent, in that the artists pursue different aesthetic goals. The reviewers who disliked this CD made the mistake of going by the absolute value of the critical ratings, not the subjective value. Perhaps they should have bought something like the latest Spyro Gyra instead, which, while quite competently arranged, performed and recorded, places emphasis on accessibility and dance-able rhythyms. This is a more challenging and intriguing set of recordings which will give greater reward upon repeated listening to the sophisticated ear."
2,Do Listeners Count?,"Well the critics certainly loved this CD, indeed Jazz Times gave it CD of the Year. Why? Every time I've played it this effort comes up short for one fundamental reason- any sane musical listener would want to turn it off straight away. Presumably young Jason is loved by the Jazz critics because he has awesome chops. But guys, don't the poor old listeners count for anything these days? Honestly this CD sounds like a car accident. I gave it two stars because Sam Rivers at least plays some nice solos on a couple of tracks. The rest of it is not worth your time."
5,FITS THE BILL,The book was just what I expected and catches the attention of the intended recipient while he learns some history
4,All Velodyne are excellents .,"Excellent subwoofer , I have the crossover @ 199 hz , and I use it for Stereo music , maybe for movie it will sound better , because for music is a little boxy , the box is detectable , something that do not happen with the SC10 that sound better because the box is not present in the Stereo so You can focus more in midrange details and tweeters . The box is relative small , smaller is the SC10 Box , maybe if I reduced internally with wood , the Subwoofer SC12 will improve for Stereo . I use velodyne crossover sms-1 @ 199 hz , no subsonic , 18 DB slope . 2 of This sound better than one . For amplification always use Digital amplifier class D , But with normal AB sound also good .I Have 4 type of Velodyne :number 1 is SC10number 2 is SC12number 3 is impact 12number 4 is impact 10but all are excellent subwoofers ."
3,Its ok but...,"If you are on a tight budget and need some heads these are the best you are going to find for the price. They aren't bad heads. I do have one issue with them however. Somehow they take all of the musicality out of your drums. not the tone, they actually perform there. but in volume. To me they seem to only have one volume... somehow. Playing softer (unless it's a lot softer) doesn't have much effect on the volume. Ghost notes and other musical nuances kind of go away."
1,No Quick Recipes Here!,"If you are looking for a book to help you make dinner quick--this is not the book for you. I recently bought six different cookbooks, trying to find something to make for dinner in a hurry so I wouldn't be tempted to eat out. Tonight I made the Garlicky Chicken out of this book. It was a hugh pain, a lot of work, took an hour, and wasn't even all that good. If you are looking for a recipe book with dinner ideas that you can make quickly try Desperation Dinners by Mills and Ross; The College Student's Cookbook by Bahr; or The 5 in 10 Cookbook by Hamilton."
3,Average Performance of the great Opera,"To be honest, when I bought this recording, I expected more, but it turned out to be pretty week performance. The only bright point of that night appears to be Kiri Te Kanawa, who is outstanding Desdemona and nothing is new about it. But my dissapointment starts and ends with Domingo's Otello. He is not the greatest in this role, his voice is so sweet and gentle, he can not be the moor! Especially, I feel it in the second act, which is for me the best movement in the opera, it demands power and volcano type voice (as Del Monaco's) which Domingo certainly lacks. However, his love duet with Desdemona in the first act is wonderful.So finally, I think if you want to listen to Domingo's Otello you should try the other VHS, with Cappuccilli and Freni (in La Scala), it appears that that particular night Domingo's voice was much better than the night in Covent Garden. For the ""Otello"" lovers I recommend Del Monaco, Tucci, Gobbi recording, which is the best so far"
4,Splendid,"This is a rather traditional, if spare, presentation of Verdi's masterpiece with a superb cast. Domingo and Te Kanawa are at their peak and both sing and act magnificently. The real surprise for me was Leiferkus, whom I have seen in person in the past and have not enjoyed; here, however, he is absolutely marvelous. In short, you can't go wrong with this DVD, which should make a fine companion piece to the later film of Domingo and Fleming at the Met. And how poignant it is to see Lady Diana applauding from the audience during the curtain call."
3,"Good, but...","As I accumulate a library of Operatic and Ballet performances I am especially attuned to the technical aspects of the recording, such as audio mix, lighting etc. This performance has a less than perfect audio mix. The orchestra is well represented but the singers sound distant. Microphone placement maybe? It is one of the reasons many live performances that are recorded do not sound as good as the film version. The people who put a film together seem to be very good at getting these things right. I have to agree with the reviewer who praised Kiri and panned Placido. His acting is very good but this opera seemed to test his range. But this too may have been related to the mike placement. The lighting was also minimal in many scenes."
5,Shipping on time and in good condition,"state on the title, it shipped to me within 3 days and in new condition that i asked for"
3,"easy read, but a little elementary...","The topic of fraud examination seems a little high-minded for a textbook mostly about defining fraud and introducing accounting ethics. There is really not much of a difference than an auditing book. It is an easy read though, and explains even the simplest of concepts in extreme detail. The large amount of examples are great, but sometimes there are a few too many."
3,Used book,The book was honestly ok. There were too many highlights but I could still read the text so over all I was happy with the book.
1,Disapproval,I found this to be one of the most poorly written texts I've ever read. It is very redundant and full of grammatical errors. It's as if two or three authors wrote the same material in their own respective words and bound it together to form one book. This same amount of material could have been covered in a comprehensive essay as opposed to a poorly written 18 chapter text book.
2,not as good as you may think ...,"I bought this detector after I got a speeding ticket from a Sheriff which I was sure I would have avoided if I had had a detector in hand. I ""tested"" it on several occassions and I have to say that it did save me from a few tickets. My next ticket came in spite of my cherished detector from a well hidden trooper. The only sign from the detector was a short bleep, which I didn't think anything off until it was too late. The bottom line is that this detector does not have good long range detection, and if you do hear something chances are you've already been clocked! It is a nice detector if you want to be aware of emergency vehicles, some construction signs, and some cops with old equipment. The compas is also nice to have if you need to know quickly which way you're heading. But be cautious if you speed, because this baby won't tell you until its too late."
2,not pleased,I am not pleased. There are not many false signals but there are not many signals period. I've been driving by cops that i'm sure have had their radar on and its not picking up anything. I do not feel confident that I will not get a ticket. It has great extra features as compared to another detector I had but if it dosn't detect well whats the point.
5,Great for any Gringo,"My decidedly American husband was able feed his bicycle addition into the Alps of Italy with this book. He bonded with the local bicylists, didn't wreck and managed to find his way back to the appartementi by dark. This book has the basic phrases and a maps that will allow you to enjoy a little adventure off the beaten track. You might even ride with a fleet of people that share a love of life, filled with riding into the anoxic elevations and descending with gusto to a glass of wine. He saw a magical bit of Italy that most tourists never see."
2,Not Pleased,This book is not straight forward. I think it is difficult to read and I felt like it wasn't a good expediture of my time or my money.
2,Compressed sound and bad vocals make a sad dvd,"WOW what can I say, I was awaiting this DVD. I'm very disappointed with this DVD, where to start, the sound is so compressed it can't drive my 5.1 setup well at all, the mix is aweful. I had to turn it way up just to hear it a bit. Most DVDS you see all the speaker meters full to the limit with driven sound, this DVD does not even move the the meters at all. His choice of vocalist is not good at all, this guy just does not have the energy that I expect, most strained and unskilled.The people in the crowd seem to be dead or sleeping little wonder. the fact is I have always enjoyed Michael Schenker, but without a vocalist the caliber of Phil{UFO}Mogg. This band sinks Like a german U-boat. Even the soul felt playing of Schenker can't save this DVD from the bad sound and poor vocals. Do yourself a favor if your a UFO fan, pull out the old albums and have a listen, save your money better spent."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I just received my copy and being a HUGE Michael Schenker fan since the 70's, I must say this is a big let down. First the sound quality is horrible, whats up with that in this day and age?? Compared to many other concert DVD's I've purchased this one by far is the worst sounding. My next nit is this: Where's Michael Schenker? The camera is shooting everyone BUT MS. Maybe a better description of this disk should be: ""If you look close and quickly, you might notice Michael Schenker on guitar"". I can really do without his bass player's drama and posing, obviously has some major self esteem issues. It seems to me that MS gets maybe 20/30% camera time. This is HIS concert right???They could have found a better crowd for shooting a live concert DVD, this crowd was, lets say, non existant for a better word. My advice is to save your money. I'm still a big MS fan, always will be, but this disk just does not due the man justice."
4,My Review,"I think this is quite a good dvd from MSG. Chris Logan does a suprisingly good job on covering different lead vocalists other tunes. I wasn't sure what to expect vocal wise but he does a good job covering Barden, Mogg, and Bonnett vocals. The best performance on the dvd for me is into the arena. I think it's very well done. The poorest performance is Only you can rock me. It's not a perfect dvd. The crowd isn't all that enthuastic but the performances are good for the most part. It's not the video for Strangers in the night but it's much better than a bootleg performance."
4,ken hower's review,"having been a long time UFO fan (up until the Chapman years of course) and a loyal Schenker fan, this DVD was a great addition to my collection, only second after the coveted led zeppelin dvd. i do though have an issue with KEN HOWER'S review. he obviously cannot shake his known boy-band preoccupation. Having been acquainted with him for a few years, his review brings to mind the illness I feel when walking up to his house and hearing the ever present, blaring, ballad ridden boy-band cacaphony(grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrril i , i , i want to play jax wif you)...the canned music that follows will stop any true rocker in their tracks. Hower's prepubescent problem is clearly reflected in his brief synopsis of this dvd. i won't be surprised to see his review of the journey dvd with the well known destroyer of journey..steve (stop that guitar solo, neil) perry."
2,"Someone fire the editor, please!!","We have here 14 very good songs from MSG; we have Michale sometimes even smiling to the audience, something rare indeed; we have an amazingly skillful bass player called James Jones (I guess)... but we can not see none of this, because the edition is so blinding fast, that it is utterly annoying, and it seriously damages the hwole watching experience of this concert."
4,are you ready to rock?,MSG was one of my favorite bands in the 80'sand it was ashame they didn't get the creditthey deserved. The first 3 MSG are the best& I admit didn't listen to much of his stuffafterwards. I just saw MSG on the last showof the tour in LA & they were great exceptBarden's vocals were not good. Schenker wasamazing & I couldn't believe he was stillthat good! Even my newphew who only knowsDoctor Doctor was blown away. I bought thisat Hollywood record store and watched itseveral times and it's awesome. The band isreally good and I actually like the vocalist.He sings things that Barden never could. Isay if your a Schenker fan from UFO or hissolo stuff this is a definite must have!I hope MSG continues with Barden for oneor more albums and tours. I will be there!
4,A must have,"I gave this 4 stars and not 5 simply because there's no Mogg. I think he made those songs complete with his expressive voice. Other than that, they were great! And the bonus interview will explain why schenker leftUFO!"
2,Horrendous DVD DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I was in Chicago at the recording of some of the songs on ""Strangers,"" including the opening introduction of the band. For the next 10 or so yrs I tried learning the solo to ""Rock Bottom"" and it became embedded in my head!!!! UFO was one of my favorite bands, influencing me to rip on the fret boards... Anyhows, I saw this DVD and bought it. Big mistake! Why does Michael just stand there on the side of the stage looking like a statue. Bill Wyman mastered that. Then the camera is a mile away. Lastly the solo to ""Rock Bottom"" was so bad! UGGGH! Muting and turning the volume low is not how to play it! That just broke my heart and to this day I'm super pist about this crap! Damn, I was so mad I only saw it once and never want to see another MSG live video or dvd again! I'll stick with the cd."
5,GREAT Book about DNS and BIND!!,"while the reference from Paul Albitz/Cricket Liu is sometimes hard to read and long winded, this text from Mr. Aitchinson covers everything and yet stays very clear and simple. I could configure and start a caching only DNS server in less than 30 minutes (well, after omitting the first few introductory chapters ;-). If you want to look up sth., there is also a big reference section. There is also an errata-page at:http://www.netwidget.net/books/apress/dns/notes.htmlI also found this book *much* more useful as the first, because of the fact that it is much more up-to-date!I can recommend this book to everyone, who*) wants to install/configure/start/maintain a DNS server*) wants to get informed about the Domain Name System in generalUp to now, this book is really an insiders' tip!!"
5,Wonderful book for both novice and expert!,"This is by far the best book available on DNS. It is very informative and yet the reading style is entertaining (not fluffy though). Overall, it is a joy to read. The author is able to communicate effectively to both the expert and the novice. Look no further than here for a great DNS reference book. Way to go Ron Aitchison!"
3,"Of Humor, Dark and Biting","This novel recalled for me a Thomas M. Disch novel that I read back in high school. I'm not sure of the title at the moment, but I think it was The Puppies of Terra. Tenn's novel could easily be retitled The Cockroaches of Terra. Earth has been invaded, and conquered, by giant beings. Mankind is still alive--underground and in the walls of the houses built by the monsters. The first part of the book reads like your typical post-holocaust story: young man seeks acceptance in the new order of society, which gives the author plenty of chance to show you how things have changed. Luckily, Tenn has an agenda, and we quickly move beyond the standard hunter/gatherer phase into a darkly satiric view of humans. Tenn is supposedly a very funny author, but in Of Men and Monsters, it's all black (as in Disch's novels)."
4,Worth checking out,"This book was pretty cool, an entertaining read. Humans as pests. Good stuff that even adults will like. The really good and smart people who know everything are somewhat predictable, but I found the story to be a very interesting, thought-provoking adventure."
3,"Great movie, OK collection","The Man Who Planted Trees is a great animated short about the power of one individual to make a difference for our environment. It's an excellent film. The collection, however, pales in comparison. It's not worth the extra money-- if you want the Man Who Planted Trees, just buy the DVD of that alone."
5,"I cried, while I was watching the movie.","If you care about the nature, humanity, or you just want to watch a good/quite European animation movie. You must see it.Since I watched this movie, it makes me feel more connected with the environmental issue we are facing now. I even started to love Oak trees.Whenever I pass any Oak trees, it always reminds me the movie.It's based on the true story which makes it even more fascinated.Just go to library or DVD rental store to rent it. Or, just buy it. It's 100% worth your time and money."
5,The Man Who Planted trees DVD,Superb content!!! The only slight niggle is that the DVDs were floating in the box when it arrived and although being brand new are already scratched ;-(
3,"Buy ""The Man Who Planted Trees"" on its own, not this boxed set","5 stars+ for ""The Man Who Planted Trees"" it is a gorgeous piece of animation, and beautiful heartfelt story about one man's stoic determination to restore a wind ravaged denuded landscape. Having seen The Man Who Planted Trees many years ago and loving it, I was keen to check out the animator's other work, but couldn't help but be disappointed as none of Frederic Back's other work lives up to his masterpiece The Man Who Planted Trees. Unless you are truely a diehard animation aficionado, and like to explore an artist's earlier musing's and influences i can't recommend this box set. But i highly recommend buying ""The Man Who Planted Trees"" on it own. Beautiful, moving and inspirational."
5,I love it!,"I first saw this film some years ago and it made an impact on me then. Now I have my own copy.It is a wonderful emvironmental film that tells a story that we all can relate to. It shows how one person can make a difference. It is a vision of making the world a better place. No celebrity, no stars, only the story. The artwork is magnificent. It really draws you into the story.It doesn't take a lot of your time. Heaven knows we are all busy enough. But it is more than worth the 30 minutes of your time that it takes to watch it."
4,Required reading,I have been in wine sales for 10 years and have never heard some of the stories in this book. This is a must for anyone in the industry (I just purchased copies for everyone that works for me).
2,kindle edition full of errors,The content was interesting though a little scattered. The formatting for Kindlr was atrocious. Multiple sentences on each page missing punctuation at the end and words supposed to end in rn ending in m instead.
5,Very Real!!!,"The reason why I love Electa Rome Parks' books is because she writes about real life issues that most everyone can relate to. I believe every woman goes through a low self-esteem or worthlessness stage of her life and Electa's books gives us hope that we can overcome that. There's nothing like reading about strong women, especially women of color. Electa, keep on writing and I will keep on reading. Can't wait for the next book."
3,Did not enjoy this work by Mrs. Parks,"Although her first two books were a little violent for my tastes, I more or less enjoyed them. This one, I did NOT. Aside from the editing errors, the storyline just didn't appeal to me. It was rushed together, and I didn't feel an ounce of anything for any of the characters."
3,Decent Read,"This story was about letting go of childhood secrets and really accepting who you are, and how you got there. Mercedes and her mother have always had a rocky relationship, but the summer that she spends with her mother proves worthwhile because both of them really come to grips with their past. Mercedes also finds a man (in a grocery store of all places) and develops a crazy summer fling that turns into more than she bargains for."
4,ALMOST DOESNT COUNT,"hello electa,once again girl you did a great job with your 3rd book. i enjoyed the characters alot, there were a couple of times i was in tears (my husband called me silly). well the pressure is on again; i need another book to read so get them gears moving. i love your style of writing. after i finish your books i share them with my clients (im a hairstylist), they are falling in love with electa rome parks!!!congratulations ,love from one of many of your fanstracy debarros , massachusetts"
2,DVD - director's discussion/reivew,The DVD we got only has a review/director's type discussion dubbed over the film. Not the actual movie. Bummer because we were looking forward to watching this movie. It was recommended to us by a French teacher. Be aware - odd DVD copy.
5,Tres Navarre rocks cause of Rick Riordan,"One of the series of seven ""Tres Navarre"" P.I. books by Rick Riordan. Tres is smart, funny, likes the ladies & can't keep his nose out of other people's business to the extent he gets shot at/actually shot/beat to a pulp/drugged by the bad guys. So cool - Everyone in Texas carries a gun or at the very least owns one. If you like cats - you'll love ""Robert Johnson"" - Tres makes him Mexican kitty food!"
4,I have never heard anything like it!,This c.d. is really good! It makes you want to get up and dance. The first time I listened to it was in my car and it just made me want to speed. I would recommend to a friend.
3,Good soundtrack but so much is missing,"The soundtrack is good but not what I expected. Sting's Windmills of your Mind is excellent, but I agree with what has been said - there is such a lot of instrumental songs missing - those songs that gave the movie such a wonderful feel. We could not get hold of the CD in South Africa and after quite a search we ordered from Amazon. I must admit that I was disappointed when I first heard it. I would not go to all the trouble of looking for it again!"
3,Kind of a let down,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is my all time favorite movie, so when I got the soundtrack I was looking forward to it being another fave. But after buying it I was let down, half the songs that I bought the cd for weren't on the soundtrack. Instead of having the instrumental songs I liked (when they were stealing the painting, the dance scene, the muted trumpet when they got the warrant for his house) they had other instrumentals that I didn't recognize because I hadn't liked them as much. I am glad that I bought the cd because I am a huge fan of the film, but it could have been better. Maybe they will make another one to follow it up..."
2,"Caution! Sinnerman runs 10+ mins! (""POWER....""etc)","Liked the movie so I wanted to get the soundtrack, BUT it doesn't play well for me as a regular listenable CD: relatively short (38min CD) and Sinnerman is the WHOLE song (you'll hear ""POWER"" more than you wish for! I dare you to count! The snippets in the movie are easier to take). Conti's instrumentals are lumped at the end and run short and repetitive. Can't say I listen to this much, but have been thinking of just taping the parts I like. :("
2,Where is Everything?,"When I saw ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" what I liked best about it was the music. Not the songs, but the music. So I kept an eye open for this CD. Finally, I found it, bought it, put it in my CD player, skipped the songs, and was shocked to see that all the terrific music I remember from the film was drained. And when there was good music, it was shortened down to about 50 seconds.Only tracks 5, 6, and 2 save this from being a total waste of money."
2,Disappointing,"If the songs are what you want, go ahead and buy this CD. If, on the other hand, you're after a substantial chunk of Bill Conti's original music,forget it! Go and see then film instead. They've left out all the best bits of it, most notably the music which runs from the point at which the crate enters the museum store, through the burglary and up to Crown's arrival at home with the stolen Monet. All the tracks which are included are too short and if your attention span is longer than 3 minutes, you might find this irritating."
4,GREAT soundtrack,"I agree with some other review, I wish this was longer, but what is here is really great. Especially Sinnerman, I had never heard the entire song until I purchased the soundtrack. I am very pleased, of course I just LOVE the movie to begin with !"
4,Grea....,"Great CD, WAY TOO SHORT! The music here is fantastic, there just needs to be more! You're just getting into it and it's over!"
3,"A Decent, Yet Short Compilation","The Thomas Crown Affair Soundtrack (1999) has some true musical highlights including the obvious Sting version of ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" which was a remake of a song found in the original movie. Another highlights include George Cordandt's ""Caban..."" and Bill Conti's piano theme found on tracks 5, 6, 8, and 9. The main drawback to this cd is it's short length. There are quite a number of songs missing from the film including the music of the heist, as well as the big band number from the dance sequence between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Still a good album, and worth a buy from any fan of the film."
2,Missing Music!,There are 3 major songs MISSING from the CD. The first was played during the breaking out of the horse at the beginning. The second was during the hot dance scene and the major mistake was not including the music from the love scene following the hot dance scene. Maybe a second CD is coming - we can only hope. Meanwhile - does anyone have any info on the songs above? Artist's name? Anything? Otherwise what music that is on the CD is quite good but - geez I hope that the missing songs surface somehow.
2,Where's Bill Conti?,"Yes, yes, you get to hear Sting doing an adequate cover of the famous song from the original movie, but I can hear Sting doing adequate covers any time. What drove me to want the CD was to hear more of Conti's driving score and to hear it alone without the movie -- which is very well done. You get about a minute and a half of 5 pieces here. It's hardly worth it."
3,nice diverse sounds,"I bought this cd after watching the movie...it was Sting singing Windmills that sold me...it's smooth jazz as only Sting can sing it. The disappointment is that the orthestrated samba track was not included in the cd...that was a disappointment. Also the cd is too short; more elaboration would have been great, but to hear Nina Simone's Sinnerman is a rare treat."
4,Love the movie! Love the CD!,"After watching the great movie, I just had to buy the soundtrack. The first four tracks are my favorite, while the others simply add to an already great CD. My only complaint is that the CD should have been longer."
5,"Listenable and diverse, very polished","I think the 2 best tracks are Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"" and Sting's cover of the theme song. Bill Conti did a great job orchestrating some great music."
4,Perfect complement to the movie but a bit weak standalone.,Overall I'm very pleased. The songs are very evocative of the movie and even Sting's warbling is tolerable. A little too much 'mellow Jazz' by Bill Conti on the original score but I love the piano motif. Watch out for Nina Simone's Sinnerman which is excellent. (Now how about releasing it in the U.K. at an affordable price instead of having to pay a small fortune for an 'Import').
1,The Thomas Crown Affair (Broken),"I had a horrible experience with this purchase, when I received the CD, the jewel case, as well as the CD were broken, I tried calling 800, etc but got nowhere. I suspect UPS broke it, and called their claims Dept, they said they'd call me and possibly pick up the CD to inspect it, needless to say they never did, and I've been getting the runaround from UPS since. I already purchased the CD from my local Amoeba Records store. If at all possible can I get a store credit to buy something else. Thank you.And if I may suggest don't use UPS to ship stuff."
5,"great movie, great music","Jazzy, at ease and up tempo. It is all there in the music. A must for a man (or women) of the world..."
2,AAAhhhhh...,"The first 3 songs are good. Sting starts it off (""Windmills of my mind?"") with a bang. ""Sinner Man"" is fun. But, alas, the rest is just elevator music recreated easily by any 14-year-old with a Casio. (OK, I'm exaggerating; a little)"
1,sounds are very muffled coming over net....,not my kind of music....but thought you should know the quality coming out over the net is very bad.... muffled and not clear at all
3,Better on CD than in the Movie,"I borrowed this CD from the library because I was so disappointed in the Bill Conti music, but liked some of the other artists heard briefly in the film. The CD is much better than as a soundtrack because the most of the loud and distracting Conti music is cut back here. Sting is the highlight on the CD.... he is a genuine talent and seems to get better and more sophisticated with time. As strictly a CD it is a good compilation."
4,Perfect Atmosphere,"This soundtrack fits the mood, sensuality, and atmosphere of this movie perfect. Complex, emotional, diverse, sophisticated. As mentioned above, it lacks several cuts from the film which was VERY disappointing. I wore out Henry Mancini's version of ""Windmills..."" on my record player long ago. Bright spot on this soundtrack is Wasip Diop's ""Everything"" with a beautiful female vocal by Beth Hirsch (Orton?)... I'm desperately searching for more from her...anyone help? Is this the gal from the UK who is 6' tall dark hair? I'd like to find more of her music to listen to. I'm now collecting Wasip Diop!********UPDATE!******* I found more from Beth Hirsch, she does amazing vocals on ""You Make It Easy"" by the French keyboard/techno band ""Air"". She also has some acoustic solo albums that are nice. Check her out! http://www.bethhirsch.com"
4,"Great Music, missing some songs from the movie","Summary:It was a great movie and the CD is almost as good. It was fast paced, great cinematography, and great music that matched the scenes. The CD brings you back to the movie. And, it stands on its own as a great listening CD.Outstanding songs include: (worth the CD)Sinnerman (Nina Simone)Everything (Wasis Diop)Caban La Ka Kratchie (Georges Fordant)The jazz is fresh, energetic, and exotic.Negative:But, it gets only 4 stars because it is missing songs from the movie. When you find you like the CD, you will have to get the movie and vice versa. It is one of those rarities that everything fits together really well. (...)"
3,"Good Start, Weak Finish","I really liked the first two songs on the CD; Sting's version of Windmills (which is why I was interested in buying it in the first place) and Nina Simone's Sinnerman. I thought the remaining songs were too short, and it seemed to me that some of the music from the movie was missing."
3,GETTING ALL HELLRASERS,I JUST ORDERED THIS TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION.. IT WAS OK.THE FIRST THREE MOVIES WERE THE BEST.BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE PINHEAD.
2,Not what I expected,"I like the flat hose for it's lightness, but the reel is difficult to use. In order to use the hose you really need to unwind the whole thing and that is not how this was advertised. I am not even using the reel and the hose is now tangled and hanging on my old hose holder. I purchased a similar Magna flat hose several years ago that was terrific, but this one is far from it."
1,"great hose, cheap fittings","Great hose, lightweight and doesn't kink, but very cheap fittings. The first time I used it, I pulled a little too hard and it broke off at the faucet. Obviously a hose is worthless if you can't connect it to anything. I bought this hose once locally for $8, and it lasted about a year and a half before it started leaking, and I've been trying to find another one. This one felt like the same hose, but the fittings make it a zero."
1,I should pay attention to reviews.,"These hoses are junk. No water pressure, cheap, leaky, plastic fittings. You'll get ""hosed"" royally. At least I got a refund and surprisingly, ""As Seen on TV"" was very concerned about my displeasure and made amends."
1,Magna Hose Flat Hose Reel,"This hose ruptured after second use. Cannot get any response from shipper, dealer, nor manufacturer.Not recommended."
4,Bursting your bubble,This hose is great as long as you remember to turn off the water when not using it. If you don't then the hose will burst from built up water pressure when it is not being used.
3,Works OK,"Works as advertised, only problem is that, given the diameter, the flow is not that high. Does roll up real well."
1,Avoid this mistake,"The reel thing doesn't work well at all, as others have noted, but I didn't mind that so much. What I did mind was that the hose itself is rather delicate. I was using it with the included nozzle, and when the nozzle was shut off, the hose ruptured from the water pressure. This on the third time of using it. This must have happened to many other users, making me wonder how it can still be on the market."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I bought two of these pieces of junk a few weeks ago, and both of them have split along the tubes so they are useless. The lightweight hose is great to use, but it just doesn't last."
1,Worked great...for a while,"I have had mine for a few years and it worked great. Now the female end is leaking like crazy and of course, there is no way to repair this.I contacted Melnor, their name was on this and they gave me a ""bum rush"" regarding this and disavowed any responsibility...sort of odd, since their BRAND name is on it. So, I guess this goes to the dump.Don't waste your money if you are expecting this to work long term."
1,This Hose Sucks,it is hard to wind and rewind....you have to carry the holder with you when you unwind it ....I finally took it out of the holder and it tangles all the time...and now it has holes in it and I can't find a repair kit for it.....
4,Love this hose!!,"I LOVE this hose. It NEVER kinks, and is extremely lightweight. I can pull it all over the yard with no effort, and it doesn't crush plants if it gets pulled over them.I have a large yard and the expensive (rubber) hoses were much too heavy to drag around, and the cheaper hoses were, also. In addition, all the other hoses kink.The only small negative is that the pressure is not as good as standard hoses -- but for straight watering it is no problem. If I want to use a sprinkler, I have to turn the water on harder than for other hoses.But all in all, I think it's a super hose and I'm buying 2 more."
1,Magna hose is junk,I've only had problems with it since purchase. I should have read the reviews first!
4,An interesting view on Iran's atomic bomb,"Recent events since the book has been released show that Iran wants a bomb but probably is further away then this book suggests. As most of the other reviews have covered the book, well enough as I will just add that I found the large section that the writer discusses on South Africa annoying as I thought it was off topic and yet an interesting one as he states that South Africa in actively spreading helping the spreading of nuclear and advanced conventional weapons. I am not totally convinced on the nuclear weapons. I hope the writer will in future, supply more information on this subject."
5,Ghost Hunting dudes,I have to tell you this season has been one of the best. I really love watching these guys and girls. I hope that they will keep going with this and doing their investigation. I recommend this to anyone that likes the paranormal. It is intriguing.
3,What the Frig....,"Because I live in Northern Delaware I was excited to get this set so that I would have the episode where GH first visited Fort Delaware. Instead, that episode was left off(??) and instead there is an edited version of the live Halloween episode from the Fort. This set should have had the first visit and the Halloween episode should be on a separate DVD. What the Frig????"
1,Material out of date,"Returned publication immediately. Badly out of date. Example did not show I26 complete from Asheville,Nc to Johnson City, Tenn. This section has been completed for over 10 years. Did not show grade information on I40 between Asheville,NC and Tenn. state line this interstate has been complete for years. Writers asked for updated information from reader yet asked the for all the research data. Why should a reader be asked to do the research and then pay for the publication?"
3,Good but not the best,"Its a good book overall but there was lot of topics this book fails to cover.Pros.* Explaining standard MPLS mibs.* Lot of material good for beginner* SNMP code* Sample buildout of a simple MPLS network* Only chapter that is useful is Chapter 8 and a bit in 9.Cons.* Explaining standard MIBs just on the froth, no in depth analyis or things like relationships between MIB values in different tables.* Only few chapters useful for a person already in OSS domain.* SNMP code again is for beginners and they are a big eyewash.* The book has been stretched out to write 300 odd pages. Not worth the cost.* Chapters 5,6,7 were not useful.I recomend this book for absolute novices in this area. And to others the book is not worth the money you will pay for.BTW. MPLS Network management from Thomas Nadeau is a lot better."
4,Valuable Resource,The book does a great job of illustrating the basics of the components and challenges that encompass Network Management using the emerging MPLS technology as a practical example. A pleasant read for those new to Network Management & MPLS as well as the more seasoned veterans. I found the book very easy to read and the order of the material and presentation of examples tied together the concepts very well.
3,Soars low,"3 1/2Barring a mostly abysmal sound quality (which in all fairness can help emulate its '51 pedigree), this energetic live disc captures Davis in a surprisingly aggressive mode, never relenting through ten tracks of hardcore hard-bop."
5,LIVE DRUGGED OUT MILES ALL RIGHT!!!,"I have not heard this one, but I Know that Miles was the coolest!"
3,Not as difficult as I thought,"I bought this dictionary because I have just started a graduate program in English. I thought it might cut out some of the more well-known words and give me a more compact dictionary that I could really use. It seems that they only cut out small words (apparently, ""difficult""=polysyllabic), and I find myself still turning to this worn-out old Webster's dictionary my boyfriend bought in high school. Also, there is not much etymological information. Having a B.A. in Latin and being very interested in poetry, I find that the dictionary is not very useful for my purposes. It's good for a basic overview of words--probably good for GRE or LSAT study. Not the dictionary for English grad students. (I have access to the OED online, so I rely on that much more heavily)"
3,cute and funny but pay attention to the message,This is a very cute and funny book but there's a serious message too. Women are responsible for their own happiness so if you don't want to be a perpetual victim make wise choices about the men you fall in love with.
2,This was not good.....,"I have seen Wicked City on vidoetape years ago and found it to be very good anime. The animation was excellent and the storyline was extremely interesting. I decided to rent the DVD and it was NOTHING like what I saw years ago. Firstly, it was NOT anime. It looked like a cheesy b-movie. Secondly, although the story was the same (at least the parts I watched before I turned it off in disgust) the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. I would think twice about watching this."
1,HORRIBLE,"This is a big miss. An inexcusably convoluted plot and laughable effects. Tsui Hark still employs the same look, fx, and, apparently, budget that he used to make movies ten years earlier, and the movie suffers greatly because of it. It all seems thrown together like some last minute school project you had a month to work on but ended up doing nothing until the night before it was due. Avoid this movie and instead watch the anime it was based on."
1,Don't even waste your time,"This is by far the worst transition of a decent story to film. It by no means holds true to the spirit of the anime. It only accomplishes mass amounts of ""sucktitude"" as it butchers everything that made the anime slick and enjoyable. Save your cash."
1,What a stinker!,Possibly the worst movie in all of creation. A sad live action version of the great anime feature. Ed Wood would not have touched this production with a ten foot pole.
3,AN AVERAGE ANIME,This anime is average.Its about a guy and a girl from another world who are supposed to guard an old man attending an important meeting between humans and the demon world but in the end they were the ones that have to attend.The movie has quite some nudity which is not nice to put in an anime.Not the best anime ive seen
2,Not for martial arts seekers,"First of all, this movie is not co-directed by yuen woo ping. Woo ping acts in this movie,and from the lack of fight scenes you can tell he didn't have anything to do with directing. Don't get me wrong though, this does have some very interesting scenes. For example, monster father and son standing on top of and controlling some airplanes. Or their complete disregard of the laws of physics. Bottom line. if you're looking for a woo ping directed martial arts masterpiece, you'll want to look elsewhere. Like,Iron Monkey,tai chi2, wing chun, Twin Warriors"
2,"buy the cartoon instead,this film is only ok.","i bought this movie because the cartoon version knocked my socks off,(i liked it).this movie was incoherent,with only a few good scenes,if your not a HUGE fan of b movies you best avoid this one.for collecters its ok."
1,One of the Worst CD's Ever!!!!!,"Dear Lord please make it stop!!!! I like world music, but not this. The pieces are way too long and each musician seems to be playing a different song. I have had this disc for for over ten years and have not been able to sit though it."
3,"Interesting reference book, though somewhat dry","Kleck has but together quite a useful overview of the research on guns. I liked the detailed discussions of the existing literature, and, as a nonacademic, I did not find it too difficult to read. ...On the survey data, I wish that Kleck would have dealt more with the survey data about offensive gun use. I also wish that he could explain why his survey data does not imply a net benefit from using guns.My only real complaint on the quality of the writing is that too much of the book is such and such shows this and such and such shows that and .... This is fine if the book is to serve as a reference source. It is not too thrilling to have to read through."
5,A must for all costumers!,"I am a former student of Rosemary Ingham's, now graduated and working as the Costume Shop Supervisor for Signature Theatre in Arlington, Va. I use her book almost everyday. Her instructions for sewing, altering, and patterning are easy to understand, clear, and concise. Plus there are great visuals to go along with the words by her writing partner Liz Covey. I can't wait until the next edition is complete. This best thing about it is that you don't have to be a professional costumer to use this book. A must for all sewers."
4,great for the home beginner or the student,picked this up off the shelf in order to help myself with a major sewing project which will result in my throwing an historical costume party to debut my creation. It has to be good so I needed the extra tips because I have no quick access to anyone with experienced costuming under their belt. Have been no less than satisfied. It could use some more concise instructions and is in need of more color pictures.
2,"Picky, picky, picky about paper!","If you want a straight-forward printer... this is a pretty good printer.If you want to scan, it's marginalIf you want to print envelopes it is absolutely terrible, awful - don't waste your time.If you want to print on any paper other than regular ink-jet flat average weight paper, get another printer. This printer smears every print job on any other type of paper.Online support/FAQ is terrible."
2,Too Heavy on Ink,"Not a bad printer, but it's way too heavy on ink.I replaced the cartridges once. (very expensive)I only printed maybe half a dozen pages and it's idle for a long time.Now it says it's out of cyan.I primarily bought it for the document feeder, and for that it does a very good job.If it wasn't for the need to scan a lot of paper, I wouldn't give it house room."
4,Not bad... not bad at all,"I just bought this printer because my old hp office jet 6110 was flaking out on me and being a college student i can't have any down time. i wan not originally looking for another all in one because my HP was so big but considering that this was small and $50 more than the printer i was looking at AND it had networking ability i decided to try it out... the print quality is not bad for a $150 printer and it's small size is great. i only have one problem with it... it seems that you have to install the brother software to be able to print... most of the ""network ready"" printers run a print server so you can just enter the ip address and go... but for the price and features overall it is a good piece of equipment"
4,Almost Adequate,"I bought this because I needed a networked all-in-one with a small footprint that didn't take a lot of power. Assembly and setup was a bit involved, but the instructions were good and even the networking Just Worked. I connected it to a LAN with three Wintel boxes on it. Print speed was acceptable for a low-volume SOHO environment, and I had no trouble with scanning and fax. I missed the ability to scan to a USB drive, although you could scan to other memory devices. The only function I had trouble with was copying; pages would frequently have areas that were unacceptably light. I finally returned it for this reason."
4,Fantastic all around,"I bought this 6 months ago for home use which includes some work and also printing out craft projects for the kids at home. Setup was fantastic on my Mac WiFi network... plugged right into the router and everything just works.When I loaded it with cheap thin paper, it would jam, but as long as I use regular ink jet paper it works like a charm. I haven't replaced an ink cartridge yet, and this has never happened to me before.I'd buy brother again."
2,"OK, but too many paper jams uses lots of ink",I definitely got my money's worth but I also got lots of aggravation with paper jams. This machine seems to use a disproportionate amount of ink.I'm going to get another Brother the MFC 465cn which received much higher reviews without any complaints about paper jams and ink.
1,"ok, but not recommended","up until i bought this printer i was a big fan of brother printers. this machine will be my last one. the online manuals are confusing and hard to read, although the internet manuals are better. print quality is below average. ink cartridges run out WAY too fast, even when printing in only black. cartridges indicate they are empty even when there is still ink in them. importing pictures from a camera card should be easy to do, but are cludgy and sometimes impossible. my recommendation is to not buy this POS."
3,Nortorious Brother MFC Error 41 (or equiv) Fatal Failures,"...I currently have a MFC-3420C. It had it's 3rd and fatal Error 41 failure April 4, 2008. The first two were fixed by Brother warranty. But, this fatal error is out of warranty. The local repair facility wants $120 to fix it....I write this review because I have read many dozens of reviews about the Error 41 (or equiv) and this fatal failure is common to many of Bothers MFC ink-jet printers, including the 38XX models. It usually takes about 6 months or so for the failure to occur....One would hope that Brother finally fixed the flaw and that it does NOT apply to the MFC-5460cn. I really liked the 3420. It never gave me any problems except for the Fatal Error 41s; which, of course, is not too good and there are a jillion previous Brother MFC ink-jet owners who really hate Brother!"
2,Use a cartridge per week?,"There are obviously 4 ink cartridges in this unit. We typically print B/W only, and 99.9% of the time print in DRAFT mode. It seems we go through a cartridge per week, and we serve no business need (private family only). As you know, these cartridges are expensive. I would suggest not buying this product or any product made by brother."
2,Ink consumption is the only drawback here.......,"The people who rave on this item do so because they have not replaced ink yet or got it for around $100.00. I paid a little more than a $100.00 and let me tell you that I am disappointed in the fact that I had to buy a complete ink set about six months ago and have had maybe 10 black and white faxes faxed to me. I was expecting an important fax today and suprise! I cant recieve it because cyan is out! These cartridges cost an arm and a leg too, almost sixty bucks (full set). I am going to break my own creed and now go to cartridge world. If I refill with brother ink one more time (full set), it will be more than I paid for the machine.The machine is sturdy and works great........just a money pit when it comes to ink. Damn glad I don't have to use color."
1,Dissapointed,"Poor quality printing, and blurry photo printing. Brother sent me a new unit, which was nice, but new one was no better. I really want my money back, but somehow I don't think Brother is going to fork it over."
5,A refreshingly honest and witty look at singleness.,"Rand writes her reflections on 30+ years of singleness in this witty and honest book. She writes from a Christian perspective, but without the cloistered and unrealistic attitudes that seem to pervade much of such literature. Rand makes it clear being single brings with it difficult and lonely times. She doesn't sugarcoat the frustrations, but doesn't resort to self-pity, either. An articulate and strong writer, Rand's sense of humor and pithy observations make this book a delight to read"
5,Timeless and priceless,"I've been tracking the music of Tracy Nelson and when I saw her name listed on the credits I had to give this album a shot -- this body of work is timeless; I know it's been out for years but the songs themselves have stood the test of time and Ms. Muldaur has done them justice. So has everyone on the album.Acoustic blues, superb musicians and vocalists - you need this album in your collection."
1,Dating 101,"Appropriate advice for those just coming out to the gay scene, but much too basic for those with a few years experience under their belt. Common sense pointers such as work-out, dress nice, exude self-confidence and get out as much as possible to network. The author has the annoying habit of using dated terms like ""sisters"" to describe gay friends and pushes his own monogamous relationship as an ""ideal""."
5,Finally good sound advice for gay men to follow!,"Finally a book that is directed towards gay men written by a gay man who is experienced in helping others find stable, healthy, monogamous relationships. This is what many of us need out here - not another relationship-touting self-help book that goes by stereotypes and pre-conceived notions and leaves you feeling even more hopeless if you are indeed hoping to build a real relationship with someone of the same sex. It is possible and Dr. Kantor gives us a wonderful step-by-step approach. I find myself going back and reading again certain sections and committing it to memory. THANK YOU, Dr. Kantor, for this wonderful guide. It is much needed and much appreciated."
5,10 stars,"If I could have given it 10 stars I would have. This is an amazing book, just what the single gay man looking to give up frantic cruising and settle down ordered. Hot tips on how to meet that guy of your dreams helped my friends find the man they were looking for. Full of specific doable suggestions based on Dr. Kantor's startling insights into how gay men operate, and sometimes malfunction, with advice on ways to look deeply at yourself and change along indicated lines so that you not only can find the right man for you, you can be the right man for him."
4,Totally OK,"I should start by saying that these are being used as a toddler toy, not as musical instruments. They make a slightly lower shake sound than I expected, but certainly perform the task of entertaining a busy 14-month old. I imagine that the eggs are not intended to be intentionally thrown on the floor, but so far they have been up for the challenge. I will try to remember to post an update if they meet their demise during such an activity."
1,Don't be a Stooge!,I was disappointed with both the selection and particularly since Shemp is in most of the films. When one thinks of the Three Stooges the original Curly is essential. Sure give Shemp one but every other one! You are better off taping the shows and viewing them on your VCR; DVD doesn't necessarily mean better!
5,Can't get any better for the price!,"I really like this item. It is easy to install and remove. This NSA 100S item is no longer available, but there is a replacement out there."
1,Waterboyfilters,I would not order from this outfit. The sent me the wrong filter and I have been trying to get in touch with them for 4 days with no luck. It is in dispute with my credit card company.
2,Not my favorite quote book,Didn't care for the selection of quotes in this book. Gave it away. Wish I'd spent my money on something else.
3,Really a Garden Thesaurus,"I have just finished writing the ZEN OF WATERING YOUR GARDEN. Which some may consider a ""coffee table book"" but it is really a challenge to the reader to get out and garden. My book has 70 quotes juxtaposed to 145 full-color photographs. If I had had this book before I then I might not have written as much as I, and guest contributors wrote. Some of the famous qoutes from the Quotable Gardener are as a matter of coincidence also in the Zen of Watering Your Garden but with illustration: which I think encourage the reader to develoop their own mantas as the water , as they garden."
4,Wide range of topics with light touch,The National Geographic Visual History of the World is good as a coffee table book - leisurely reading offering nuggets of information. It only scratches the surface of the wide range of topics covered which is expected as it is not meant to be a definitive source of historical information. The photographs in the book are all superb as should be expected from a book offering a visual history of the world. The book goes for volume of information rather than context or impact but it is a very good buy for the price.
4,informatie and pleasing to read,"This was an in-depth look at our world history and written in an easy fashion.The pictures were well rendered and I loved the stuff written on the early cultures (the byzantine empire, etc).However, I was a little disappointed on the all-too brief pages written on Asian history. Asia has over 12,000 years of history combined (if you include India, Japan, China, Korea and the Islamic worlds etc). and the authors/editors decide to skim it with only 15 pages or so?That's not quite a complete view of the world, if you ask me....There's plenty of focus on the European eras (all of them) and not enough on the Asian ones.Still an excellent read though; and for any student of history (or needing a paper done in minutes) this is definitely the book to use!"
2,few maps for a history book,"In my opinion the book has a major flow, which is it contains very few maps. Unless the reader has a good idea about ancient and modern world history, it is quite hard to figure out where everyhing is where. The book is very superficial in this respect."
5,Worthy Of Its Title,"The good reviews National Geographic Visual History of the World has gotten on Amazon aren't hype, this is a history book worth owning. This is more of a survey overview of earth's past than it is an in-depth study, but for family use it's absolutely magnificent. This book has illustrations that rise to the levels of high art and the text is a near perfect blend of impressive scholarly expertise and colloquial readability. This is a book to pore over for fun and to take pleasure in owning. It makes a great adornment to any home library and rises above any other history text that's even close to this price range."
4,"Ernest Tubb, elder statesman","This collection represents an effort by Pete Drake to make Tubb's hits available, after MCA/Decca had lost interest in Tubb and let almost his entire catalogue slide out of print. Tubb's voice is weathered and aged, and the band isn't as good as Tubb's mid 60s unit. That said, Ernest Tubb was never Caruso anyway. Tubb's strength was his warm personality and the character in his voice, both of which continued to shine through in his vocals. This is a worthwhile collection that any Tubb fan will want to own. If some of the recordings sound excessively familiar,it is because many of these recordings were overdubbed with guest stars for an Ernest Tubb tribute album. Almost all the classic songs are here, and Tubb fans will be singing along with the CD player"
4,"entertaining read, good historical novel","so maybe this book is a little postmodern--hence the other reviewers irritation at its fragmentation. however, i really appreciated the multiplicity of points of view in the novel--skinner allows you to reach your own interpretation about mata hari rather than spoonfeeding you his own conclusion about her. the writing is pretty good, but not outstanding, but the book is very effective in it's evocation of orientalism and of an era."
4,History in narrartive,"I have been aware of the name mata hari for many years. However, I suddenlt became fascinated with this extraordinary woman's life story when it was dramatised on radio 4 in the autmn of 2003. Red Dancer, follows in that vein. Rather than an hostorical biography in the traditonal sense, the author presents a series of what are effectively vignettes whereby different characters in the story tell their own tale of this ambitious, talented, notorious but ultimately tragic woman. I found it very absorbing particularly as there is a clever balance of imagined accounts of her life as told by others and historical and media information (press cuttings etc) from the time. Well worth a read"
2,such promise but lacked purpose,"This book was very exciting at first, as Skinner chose to reveal the character and life of Mata Hari through the eyes of others in her life, each chapter from the account of a different person... however he lost track from that orginal idea and once I finished the book- I didn't feel like I had learned anything about who Mata Hari was. It nearly had nothing at all to do with her. It contains some lovely character sketches but there is no story. And he gives Mata Hari absolutely no personality, even in the chapters from her own point of view. There are some interesting histories thrown in on Picasso, absinthe, and other era points of interests but they are so out-of-the-blue... I felt like at the end all this random information would somehow tie together but it never did. I wish he had had an editor who pushed him a little harder because he is a talented writer and the concept had so much potential."
1,Truth or fiction?,"This book was very disjointed. Each semi-fictional chapter about Mata Hari's life was followed by a chapter about an aspect of her times. I learned quite a bit about dowsing, the invention & use of the Zepplin balloon, the Orient Express, the roots of cubism, & the history of absinthe. Unfortunately for Skinner, I found these interspersed chapters to be much more interesting than the chapters dealing directly with his primary subject. His style of writing left me confused as to what was fiction & what was truth. In addition, the story is told from so many conflicting points of view that it is impossible to piece together a cohesive picture. Stick with the non-fiction biographies of Mata Hari for a more interesting & cohesive read."
1,waste of money,"I started reading this book a few days ago because I wanted to learn more about the life of Mata Hari, but the author talks about other topics instead of the main subject.I don't really recommend this book unless you wanna know more about other topics that are NOT related to Mata Hari."
2,"Good, but sooooo Many Errors","Yes, this book is packed full of facts and photos that will delight any Ford enthusiast and it will provide hours of interesting reading.Having said that, it is also the most poorly edited book I have ever read. Seemingly every page has numerous errors of every type. Not just simple typo's. Many pages include photos of vehicles that are mis-named or from a model year covered in another chapter (a 1974 LTD being marked as a 1973 for example). The author's spelling, grammar and syntax is poor (note to George Dammann, when making a comparison of two things, use ""more"" and ""less"", not ""most"" and ""least"").In the beginning of at least one chapter, the opening text columns are in the wrong order, making the reader sift through everything to read properly.If you can overlook all of this, the book is enjoyable. But you may end up wondering what other errors are contained in the book, besides the ones that jump out."
5,A BETTER IDEA,"This is a book sure to delight any Ford lover and especially anyone who loves classic Fords. The photographs are a major bonus. Readers get treated to some really cool pictures of some really serious cars, e.g. Ford Falcons and soaring Thunderbirds.I like the way the equipment and number of automobiles manufactured is included. I also really liked some of the classic photographs, such as a beautiful 1961 Ford Falcon in a showroom and sale pictures as well. This is a comprehensive, well researched book that certainly lives up to the classic Ford slogan, ""Drive a Ford! It's a Better Idea!"""
5,Typically hilarious,"Like the best of MST3K's work, it is smart without being intellectual, sarcastic without being snotty, silly without being dumb. It makes for a very funny experience."
2,Problems,The doorbell rings after pushing several times. I have missed several people who have come to the door because the bell didn't ring when they pushed it. And not one but both buttons broke after only 4 months.
3,"Good, but...","I purchased this door chime unit because the button on a less expensive unit was not working regularly.Now I have received this unit, and sometimes the button works and sometimes it doesn't. Not really what I was looking for."
1,A joke... A pure joke,"It advertise 100 feet range, but I think it's for open air, not for walls between the devices. Who is using this via open air anyway? Who is using this all outdoor or indoor? The range more like 10 feet at most if not via open air. They should also advertise the product both indoor and outdoor ranges so I don't have to waste my time and just move on look for something else."
1,no range for two buttons,"I had the receiver set between both buttons, and the front door was only 15 ft away, as I plugged the receiver in the dining room far wall from the door. my dinning room is right by the front door. i figured I might miss some back door rings as the back door is off the kitchen on the other side. so far the back door is hit and miss with the receiver 25 ft from the button but I found out I was also missing front door rings!so maybe this does not work on brick houses? I now have the receiver on the wall just behind the button. but I had to give up on the back door. I am going to buy a new one for the back door, but from a better company. wasted my money on a two button set. dont waste yours, save your packaging for a few weeks..... it only worked the first few days. oh, and the tape does not hold, use screws for the buttons."
5,Wireless Door Bell,Received the Heath Zenith wireless door bell in very short order after ordering on-line. Simple installation instructions had both the front and back units installed and working in less than 15 minutes. Units work great...no problem.
4,very pleased,I am just wanting to say i received the product yesterday and within 5 minutes of opening the item i had the bell tones set and the front and back door bells in place. It is a very convinient item and glad i chose to purchase this one. My only concern that i have is that when i attempted to increase the volume on the base it just would turn and turn and actually not increase to the volume level i was trying to get..So i feel that is the only problem is that if you are alittle hard of hearing this product may not be what you need. Other than that am very pleased
3,The occasional false alarm,I mounted this doorchime on the door of my residence as it can be difficult to hear someone knocking. The building is concrete and the door metal but the chime signals the base 15 metres away just fine. The only downside is that the chime will occasionally ring without someone having activated the button. This is random and occurs approx twice per month.
2,Not Happy,I received two back door buttons though one reads front. Back door is automatically set to one chime.They are both set to one chime.
2,returned this item because one of the outdoor ringer buttons refused to work at only 20 feet away from main unit,"I now have holes in my siding without a door bell after securing the ringer buttons. I tried the ringers before I screwed in the unit and they worked fine. After I secured the ringer to the siding, it didn't work."
3,Wireless Plug in chime Zenith SL-6167-C,"I just started using it so I don't have much to say other than the Volume control doesn't work. The item came with a very high volume sound, and I tried to lower it but no matter which way I turned the volume regulator, it did not change. I called the manufacturer and the technician told me that the volume didn't work in this item so I had to leave like that. Well, they advertise volume regulator and it doesn't work. I haven't tried to change the tones so I don't know if it is the same story."
2,Didn't work very long,Regrettably I've had very little success with wireless doorbells and this was no exception. Looked good out of the box..but after a few weeks it did not function.
3,wireless doorbell,"I had bought an older model of this doorbell a number of years ago. It worked okay until the push button on the back door (which is the one everyone uses at my house) quit working. Instead of buying a new pushbutton (which costs almost as much as the whole thing) I decided to try the new one. It got really good marks. First of all, don't use the double sided sticky tape that comes with it as it lasts about two seconds. The push button for the back door lasted about a week before it wouldn't work anymore. I tried putting in a new battery to no avail. At this time, I'm waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. I think they will replace it. Sure hope it doesn't go out that fast again."
4,A Good Product,"This wireless door bell is just what I was looking for. It has a button for both the front door and the back door. Although the range of the signal is a bit exaggerated it was enough for me to position the bell chime to pick up the signal from both my front and back door. The bell chime works from the electricity of a wall outlet, not a battery. A small 12v battery is needed for both the front and rear door buttons, but those batteries come free with this set. The bell chime itself is nice and small, so that it is easy to plug it into the bottom ofwall outlet and still have room on the top plug of the outlet to plug in something else. Let's see how long it lasts. So far, I am delighted."
3,A Ghost at the Door,"This bell come with two buttons, one with a complex chime for the front door, and another with a simple chime for the back door. For some reason on my model the complex chime just goes off sometimes. For the first week we were always going to the front door, and finding no one there. Even after I took down the front door button, and took out the battery it sill goes off from time to time, though less often.Very strange. But hey, that backdoor is working well."
2,Fails soon (trust me!),"The mail failure with this product for me is that the button on the outside unit stops making a proper connection. I'm now on my 3rd push button unit, and it's stopped working after just a few months. If you push and wiggle the button, it will make contact and set off the bell, but FedEx and UPS don't have time to play around with the doorbell, despite the notes I've had to write on and around it. Trust me... 3 of these push buttons have failed (and I've wasted batteries assuming initially that they are the cause). Without a well-built push-button, the whole system is a waste of money. Don't buy this system."
1,Worse purchase ever!,"We thought this would be perfect for us as we are elderly and could not hear the doorbell when we are upstairs. However, this thing keeps going off all on its own. We threw out the packing slip and package so are unable to return it. We are really disappointed."
5,Most Amazing Sitarist,"Mr. Seshadri is the greatest Indian Classical Sitarist today! His music permeates all times and places, creating one of the most thought-provoking, life energizing experiences one can have. One must listen to the beauty and grace to understand what I am conveying."
5,Illuminations,A must CD for any serious enthusiast of the sitar! The performance and recording is splendid!!
5,The Story of the Famous 34th Infantry Division,"I was in the Division and I wanted to read about the things I participated in. I truly loved this book, and recomend it for anyone, veteran, history buff, or anyone who is interested in a famous division."
1,Waste of money!,The grate started to bend and warp after the first fire. After the fourth fire it was garbage.
1,Need to replace after only a few fires,After only two or three fires the metal warped and sagged to the point that I need to replace it. I would NOT buy this product again.
4,A good read,"I feel it's a good book for someone wanting to get started in surround sound, but doesn't want to wade through the technical jargon found in the only two other industry books.It's definitely simple, but has a lot of illustrations that are helpful in getting a room set up. If you're building a high $$ surround room, this isn't the right book. If you're using a creative lab system or something similar, this is the right book."
2,Don't expect 5 perches!!,"I was disillusioned by the description of the product and therefore did not receive what I expected. The product is described as varying in texture and thickness, and the picture led me to believe that I'd receive a variety of perches but that the colors I receive will be random. Color is asinine, but I expected an assortment of perches in different lengths and thicknesses. I was not prompted to make a selection for a Small - XL bird perch, and the pictures are the same for all sizes, so I think the seller should tailor product descriptions and pictures to each individual perch. I felt duped when I opened my package and found one extra small perch!"
3,Manfrotto Low Angle Adapter,"Haven't had a need to use this. No instructions provided, so you just have to guess.Support from Manfrotto is very poor."
5,Love all things English,"This will give you many pleasant hours of dreaming, drooling and reading. So so much better than the American version!!"
1,country living,"It is difficult to review this magazine, after a month they have not seen fit to send any copiesI will much happier if they would at least send an old copy or somethingMaybe this reminder will help"
2,AA Road Atlas: Ireland,This atlas is inferior to the Ordnance Survey Atlas (ISBN 978-1-905511-40-2). We bought the AA atlas before our Ireland trip and found we needed the Ordnance Survey atlas once we got there.
1,Absolutely useless!,"This atlas was absolutely useless during our trip to Ireland. It did NOT provide detailed maps of the cities, and the layout and organization was horrible! The free map we got from the Rental Car Agency was of more use than this atlas. Do NOT buy this product!"
2,better concept than execution,"It's a nice concept. Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, HP Lovecraft, and Marie Leveau are part of a secret society of demon-busters dedicated to fighting incursions of the Lovecraftian mythos into our world. There are cameo appearances by famous mystics A.E Waite and Aleister Crowley. The problem is that first-time novelist Wheeler isn't really up to the task of fleshing out all of these colorful characters. Conan Doyle sort of works as a real-world incarnation of his literary creation and Houdini is not bad, but HP Lovecraft rings false as some kind of steampunk technomystic, and voodoo queen Leveau comes across surprisingly bland. There are also some serious anachronisms. At one point, Lovecraft is described as using a ""transistorized"" device. Transistors? In 1919?"
4,Not bad for a first book,"An enjoyable read for a lazy Sunday afternoon, it reminded me of those Saturday matinee adventure movies I use to watch as a kid. The cast of characters were interesting, I especially liked Houdini and Lovecraft. I would not call this book a page turner but it did hold my interest. I wish the author could have showed us more about the lost tribe of Enoch. How they survived through the ages, what and how they came to be in New York. If you like stories with a cast of characters on a quest similar to the movie League of Extraordinary Gentlemen you will enjoy this book."
2,"Too bad, Mr. Wheeler","I usually love books set in this time period. Not this one.With a cast of characters including Sherlock Holmes and Harry Houdini, I thought it would be great! Turned into a boring read. Oh, well, I'll look forward to the next Holmes novel."
2,At least I'm done reading it...,"This book had such promise! And it really did hold to that promise for about the first 100 pages... but then we are treated to about 200 pages of a chase scene that we, the reader, have no real idea about why we are chasing these creatures, what they are, etc. Way too many holes left open with unanswered questions at the end. Just plain ridiculous! I'm so glad I'm done reading this so I can get the bad taste out of my brain right away!"
1,Some tree died for this???,"This should've been called The ArcAnus--no way was this load of crap written--it had to be excreted. The literary lions it used as characters were woefully untrue to their realities, especially H.P. Lovecraft. Set in 1919, it references transistors, which weren't invented until 1948. The writer has the Winchester Mystery House in San Francisco, not San Jose where it really is. If you ever see this book, hit it with a stick."
1,A failed script becomes a failed book,This was originally a script meant to hit the silver screen. It was optioned (by Miramax I think) but never picked up. Probably because it was so hollowly written. The remedy? Turn it into an equally hollow novel. Save your money.
2,Blue Book of Acoustic Guitars,There's a lot of info in this book but there's a lot that is missing or incomplete. I feel for the price this volume should be more complete. Save your money and think about the Vintage Guitar Value Guide. It is a a handier guide if you have to carry it with you to a show or out treasure hunting.
3,Not bad,The book could really use some photos. It is a good reference book and should come in handy. I am disapointed that the book has pricing informaion for each guitar but the companion CD does not.
3,Just OK,This is the 4th version I've purchased. They used to include more research ever time. Seems like they contain less info now just cheap current guitar stuff. These used to be good. Very incomplete.
2,Inaccessible,"I found it to be a snobbish work full of obscure words and language, and boring. It is very scholarly and how brow, and a drag to read. I imagine that some persons would reason that this is appropriate for such a book, but even so, I could not finish it. It did not cast any light on the work of the stoics, not for me anyway. You might find it usefull though, but I did not."
3,One of the best ?,"Read many reviews claiming that this is one of the finest aor albums in a long time, i must admit i would not go that far, songs are quite good but i found the production of the album a little lacking, in a number of departments."
2,"Meh...nicely made, but they can't take the heat if you don't have stock headers","WARNING: If you have aftermarket headers on your car, don't waste your money on these. The straight boots will rest too close to the primaries, and they'll be misfiring in a matter of miles. Doesn't matter if you use fiber-mat protective covers, either. That was $90 down the drain."
3,Old info,"This book was written decades ago. It posed some interesting ideas that have been researched and documented since then, and some of his theories have proven correct. It documents his experiments (not for the faint of heart or for animal lovers. There wasn't a movement against animal testing when this book was written!) ad infinitum, in great detail, as well as the experiments of others in the mechanics of digestion, and was the basis for a lot of research since then. A good foundational read, to be followed by more up-to-date info."
1,"Disturbing, not for kind hearted animal lovers!","I was very excited to get this book, but it has so much description of what amounts to torture of dogs in it, that I just can't read more of it and am actually ashamed to have it.It was written by someone who doesn't seem to have any regard for the wellbeing of housepets and did horrible experiments on dogs for questionable gains. I'm not a member of PETA and am generally thick-skinned, but this one gave me nightmares.What they did to get the information isn't worth the outdated information the book contains."
3,"Had high expectations, but am a little disappointed","First of all, he looks awesome. Great detail, even the albums. His face is really good.However, I'm sad to say that he sounds horrible. I even replaced the batteries, which are not commonly found, with no improvement. It sounds like he's in slow-motion. Plus, while replacing the batteries, his head came off. Removing the head (or destroying the brain) is not supposed to happen to Shaun, only to zombies! Lucky, it kinda glued back on, but not securely. Since I'm embarassed to play the quotes from the movie (on top of the low quality, there are only 3! FAIL!), he doesn't get handled much.It's cool to look at on my shelf, but overall is quite a letdown."
3,Excellent likeness,"I was hoping for more lines. You can cycle through all four recordings pretty quickly.The batteries it shipped with were already leaking, so I have to pop for new ones.Satisfaction outweighs shortcomings by a thin margin on this one."
3,Happy with the purchase.,"Love the product, just wish the spoken parts were the funny parts! Seems they just used random sentences for this figure. Disappointing."
5,Notre Dame Game Day Scores Points With Me,"Notre Dame Game Day: Getting There, Getting In, and Getting in the Spirit is a must-read for even the most casual Notre Dame observer. Author Todd Tucker provides invaluable insight for making the most of your Notre Dame game day experience, including what to do before, during and after any Fighting Irish home contest. Even more intriguing are the anecdotes Tucker sprinkles throughout the book about Notre Dame, its history, its players and its facilities. That's where Tucker's depth of knowledge about his alma mater really shines through.Even if you're no ""Golden Domer,"" - and I'm not - you can appreciate the great traditions and spirit that Tucker ably details here. It's an easy read. I was left wanting more, including a couple of midfield seats."
1,One of the many reasons I hate rap.,"How can the kid below this review say this album can be ""great""? There is absolutely nothing ""great"" about this ""mash-up"", it's more like an ultimate mockery. Hip-hop has no place in rock or metal, and it never will, Cypress Hill isn't an exception either. How could Metallica LET these half-brained people butcher some of their greatest songs? People, honestly, if you go along with this garbage, I have three words for you, YOU ARE CRAZY!!!"
1,It was butchered!!! Cliff is turning over in his grave.,"I liked ""Mash-up"", but I love Metallica. The first 10 seconds I thought I was going to sick. SICK! I hated it. You can't mess with perfection, period! I wouldn't even give this album a single star, all the songs were butchered. Man, Cliff must be turning over in his grave."
5,Excellent Overviews in Context,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore not only the structure of Gothic cathederals but also the political, cultural, and religious context in which they were built. This is a very thorough look at all these aspects of the enterprise. The prose style makes this book a pleasure to read."
4,Good for very small jobs.,"Don't try to use this as a hedge trimmer! However, it's perfectly suited for trimming rose bushes and small hedges in a garden. Much better price than similar competing products from major home improvement stores."
3,Batteries are terrible,"Have bought two of these, one for me, one for my mom. Batteries lasted two - three years and then becam worthless. Replacement batteries not found anywhere."
2,gardener tool,not powerful enough for most shrubs or bushes in my garden. charge doesnot last long either
3,General Guide for Adoptive Parents,This book would be useful to adoptive parents who are beginning to learn about the life-long impact adoption has on adopted persons and birthparents. The book has clearly-presented practical advice.
2,Disappointing,There is nothing new in this book. Its like a collection of bits from all the other books I've read. It seems to tread carefully around the important issues in adoption.I am very disappointed with it.
5,To Fire your Soul,"This was the first full length release of Wendy. The most climatic song being the title track ""Zero"", ignited my soul. The songs on this CD are a wonderful blend of darkness and light, and one actually feels drawn into Wendy's world as each song plays through. Each song deals with a different aspect of The Craft, with Zero being a music dramatization of a magickal circle being cast. Continental Isolation indicating that we are all of one world, no matter on which shores we reside. For those looking for music dealing with The Old Religion, or for music that just plain touches your soul, Wendy is your singer. If you're looking at making your first purchase of her music, Zero is definately the one I'd recommend first."
5,One of the best,"Beautiful voice,all songs are hountimg,sweet and so true to the craft. Most of the artists are quite boring but not this one."
1,Phillip Kerr Did It Better,"So yet another British literary lion takes a stab at the gumshoe genre... Unlike Kerr's ""Berlin Noir"" trilogy, however, Amis' ""Night Train"" completely misses the mark as his plot drags, his character is unbelievable, and his attempts at American lingo and mood fail dismally. He should go back to what he's good at: modern fiction."
3,Mixed feelings,"This book offers a superbe, moving and funny portrait of a woman, but not much of a mistery. When i read mistery genre (or any other genre) i am comfortable with ambiguity, and i do not necessarily expect a conventionally clear finale. But the point is that, even if ambiguous, the plot or characters have to be ""interesting"", and Night Train, particularly the last third of the book is not."
3,A Sunday drive,"If you have no place to go and nothing better to do then you can read Night Train the way one takes a Sunday Drive. Sure it's witty and short enough to keep one's interest but it is pretty evident that it has no destination or purpose. This must be Amis' desultory genre buster, sort of like Mailer with Dead Men Don't Dance, but Mailer did a better job. I'm not sure whether Amis' has much respect for the genre or not. And what is this, ""I am a police,"" all about?"
2,Unconvincing,"Short and sour, this is a story of an unconvincing suicide mystery investigated by an unconvincing woman ""police"" in an unconvincing Chicago. That it does not convince isn't even the main problem. The withholding of information from the reader is. We are told that of all the bodies Ms. Mike O'Hoolihan has ever seen, none has stayed with her like this one. Why? That Officer O'Hoolihan finds the reason for the suicide and doesn't share it, except for a corny reference to suicide being contagious, is downright sophomoric. No mystery here, just a good writer trying to hoodwink his reading public into thinking that he is consistently a good writer. Thanks for nothin' Mr. Amis."
3,This fine horse fell at the last !,"Well for much of this book I was enraptured. Usually Martin Amis' novels don't need unpredictable, intriguing endings due to their shear wealth of literature, but do any-who (read 'Money' or 'London Fields'). However, this one did but didn't due to the fact that it seemed to build up to something which it didn't produce. Mr Amis if you read this do you not agree ? Did you churn this out unwillingly ? However, apart from that it contains for the most part an Amis story which any Amis enthustiast will enjoy to some degree."
2,Amis is way off his form and getting careless.,"This noir-wannabe mystery wasn't worth what I paid for it, and I read a library copy! Amis sets up a mystery which he doesn't explain to any degree of reader satisfaction, narrates through a completely unconvincing female character, sets it in a generic American city with no sense of authenticity in any of its details... Ah, but there's a killer photo of Amis on the dust jacket. Reading our own publicity, are we? Impressed with ourselves maybe just a skitch? London Fields this one ain't. Reread Elmore Leonard instead."
2,The ending leaves you feeling cheated,"You're set up for a ""classic whodunit"" mystery type of conclusion, but the ending leaves you feeling cheated. Fortunately, not at a great investment of time (175 pages, large print)."
1,Less Than Zero,"Some who defend Amis' book make the insulting assumption that those of us who didn't like it were simply put out by the lack of an ending, implying that we ""don't get it."" Maybe the non-ender was a problem for some, but my complaint is still that the book is terribly written and will provide an extra laugh for American readers, who could make a game of counting the out-of-place Britishisms in this putatively American-based book. If you're going to use any vehicle (such as noir) for an apparently 'modernist' experiment, you should learn to drive first....I will point everyone again to Kerr's ""Berlin Noir"" series. If you insist on reading Amis, however, please go immediately to ""The Rachel Papers,"" one of the best books ever written, or ""Time's Arrow,"" also one of the best ever, or ""Success"" or ""Money"" or...."
3,Runaway Train,"Readers who enjoyed Amis' extraordinary novel London Fields or Money may be disappointed with Night Train's brevity and its relative dilutedness. Nonetheless, the novel remains provocative and rather unsettling.Also apparently unclear to some: Night Train is more than a detective novel; it's an existential investigation into suicide; not a happy topic for many, but an edgy, engaging one for the rest of us."
4,"Not too bad, but enjoyed The Information more","Enjoyed this book, but couldn't help asking who edited the darn thing? Too many British usages and the ending needs some work. But Amis is brilliant at capturing a Nabokov-type style and that is the best reason to read him. The book yields some interesting information--I did not know that pharmacists were at high risk for suicide."
2,A disappointing recommendation,"After reading some of the original recommendations for Night Train, and after reading the sample chapters, I ordered the book and eagerly awaited a good read. What a disappointment! A good beginning slows to a slow crawl, and the ending would be a welcome finish to the whole sad mystery, except that apparently even the author could not figure out what happened to the victim, and so sort of mumbled the ending in a pretentious manner, no doubt hoping that the reader would be fooled into believing that the ending was just too clever. Sorry, Mr. Amis, but I work for 'police"", and as a detective, or even a guy on the street, you'd never make it in our department!"
2,very disappointing,"This book was among others in the amazon list of books recommended (based on other books I have read). Yuk! I found it much too stylized ...pretentiosly so. It was boring, not well written, and the bottom line is that this book is simply not at any point a ""page turner"". I had to make myslef finish it, thinking that at any time it might get good, but alas, it never did. I hate when that happens!"
2,Tin Ear Mistaken for Brilliance by Reviewers,"I never for a moment bought that this narrator was a woman or an American or ""a police."" The voice is not only phony and blaringly inconsistent, it's full of Anglicisms. If that's not enough, the end doesn't make any sense no matter how many times you read it. This may be the most over-rated so-called thriller of the last 12 months."
1,Martins line,"Martin Amis has found the ideal forum to compliment his writing in Tina Browns latest attempt to prove that she has all the lterary acumen of a Beverly Hills hair dresser, Talk magazine. Lets just hope for the sake of good writing that Suicide runs in Mr. Amis's family."
1,"Terrible, terrible book","I clicked one star because I had to click something, but the truth is that this book doesn't deserve any stars at all, or perhaps negative stars. This is the first Amis book I have read, and the last. Muddled writing, senseless plot, and a terrible grasp on anything American. I am mad at myself for wasting the time. Steer clear, and read just about anything else before you spend one minute on this garbage."
2,not the greatest thing,"Well when i got this book i thought that there was going to be more action in it. But it is just a story about a girl who did suicide (i am not done with it yet). This book also has to many swears in it, no one talks like that, only teens do (that are immature). I can't wait to be done with this book."
4,Makes an impact,"This is the type of book where I think certain life experiences add to its enjoyment. its a gritty, ugly, uncomprosing novel centered around murder (?), urban blight, alcoholism, and suicide. The story proceeds pretty much like an old Mike Hammer cop-thriller (replete with Amis' superior descriptions and style) but with an everpresent undercurrent of despair. Never knowing exactly where that feeling comes from can be credited to Amis' superb writing.A ""Night train"" evokes an image of something big and loud, screaming out of the murky darkness, only to disappear again...much like Mike, the lead character's life. What is it we learn in the final 2 paragraphs? That this first person account of a crime investigation is actually a long, sad, suicide note. Definitely worth the read, if youre in the mood."
2,Bad Ending,"Everything just fell through at the end. You'll be gripped by the story in the beginning, and then it's downhill from there. If you're not into getting some kind of answer at the end of the book, this would be for you."
2,judging a book by its cover,"Here I thought I was getting a crime story, a who dunnit, and what it turns out to be is a character study. Night train purports to be a page turner, an engaging detective story or police procedural. If it is, it's more in the style of PD James than Elmore Leonard. I suspect readers who have been disappointed by this novel would be more justified in leveling their criticism at the publisher's and bookseller's hype than at the author"
4,Unpretentious. A good read for rainy days and cool nights.,"At first read, Night Train immediately captures and hurtles you into the alcohol-and-cigarette stoned world of detective Mike Hoolihan, the (female) protagonist of the novelette. The book strikes me as being funny at times with its generous help of cop-on-the-beat jargon such as ""you're f'ing me!"" (sic), and totally unpretentious in reflecting real-world beat cops. However, one still comes away from Night Train with mixed feelings of what Amis is trying to bring across to his readers."
4,2 good points,The quality of the book is very good and what is nice as well is that it contains the preface by Juan Valera who wrote it for the second edition of the book.
3,Somewhat disappointed.,I was expecting a rollercoaster suspense novel. Instead I felt like I was reading a movie script. The novel did not really seem to have much substance.
4,A Real Holiday to read,"On my way home for the holiday, a good friend gave me this book to read on the plane. I enjoyed it very much and reccomend it highly. I haven't read anything like it, and hope to see more books by this author. It was very fast paced and left me feeling very good, it struck many feelings and many levels and will probably stick with me for a long time."
3,Fun but not blockbuster,First 100 pages seemed rather amateurish. Didn't feel that way the rest of the story. The book seemed to take off and it was pretty exciting. The story was a bit silly but the several hours spent were probably well worth it. Too early to conclude author is genius but is promising.
4,"Intrigueing, this book is a blast!",Picked this up at Mary Martin's in Adelaide-read it in two hours. I have not read a books as refreshingly exciting as greenwald's-I have read many of these reviews and many of the favourable ones are indeed correct. Greenwald is a talent that the rest of the world is entitled to
3,"Hey, give us a chance to read this book first!","There has been so much hype and hysteria, along with some real knocks, for this book which has been published in Australia but not yet in the USA--even though the author's an American! The one copy I saw must have been smuggled in from Canada, and it's a good read"
4,This is a good book to read on an airplane.,"I got a copy of this book in the Cayman Islands and read it on my home to Columbus, Ohio. It is a good book that is exciting and like watching a good movie. I read the other reviews and most of them are right except for the one that compares it to love story nineteen seventy nine. I saw that movie and this is more like an indiana jones movie. maybe that person didn't get it. reading is either homework or fun. This was fun"
4,Decent Read,There was no BS about this book. It delivered what the reviews said. I want more of this. Thank you for honest reviews.
3,Better than I expected.,I found this to be a nicely paced story with interesting surprises that revolve around the effects of a spear taken from the hull of a sunken boat. This was a compelling enough story that I have written the publisher in Australia to find out if there is a sequel and await their reply. I usually make my purchases of books after reviewing what other readers have to say on this and many of the other on-line services. Books are more expensive than they used to be and the book companies spend scads of money to sell their wares. I also thought that the cross racial relationships in the book were very good and could be offensive to some. Black and white people CAN get along.
2,So-So,"Might have been a decent plot, but charecters were pretty stereotypical, and the writing way too simplistic. Reminded me of a ""hardy boys"" book, with adult themes."
5,The best thriller I've read from the West in years!,"I picked up the Spear of Golgotha in Australia and have not read anything as enjoyable in years. It has a good, fast moving plot, great characters and really rotten bad guys. It was fun to read and the next thing I knew the plane landed and I wanted another Greenwald book."
1,This Spear A Dull Instrument,"After reading it I wonder if I read the same book that others talked about. This is one of those novels that is so bad, you end up reading it just to find out how it ends: One dimensional characters, pseudo-science, the usual Nazi occult conspiracy, a plot that gets sillier by the moment --- hell, even the Hell's Angels are in this one --- and a entirely predictable ending. In other words, Young Frankenstein meets Jane Fonda meets Austin Powers. Ironically, Mr. Greenwald writes well enough to keep the pages turning but I ended up finishing the book for the wrong reasons. Something like reading a comic book for the art. If World War II genre is what you like I would suggest John Katzenbach (Shadow Man), Loup Durand (Daddy), and anything by Alan Furst (but especially The Polish Officer)."
2,Just Okay.,It was interesting how the spear works and how it got into the hands of the Germans. It is not too different from other books in its visuals. It reads like a movie and reminded me of the Mummy. It was okay.
4,Took me by surprise,"I work for Zales jewelry store in the Dallas area, and I had to go fill in for someone else at another store while they were on vacation. I saw this watch sitting in the clearance case and just fell in love with it on sight. I've had it for six month and haven't had a problem yet. I wear it to work, about five to six days a week, and whenever I have to dress it and I get a lot of compliments about it. I do take almost fanatical care for it though. About once every other week I separate the band from the watch and then clean it. Once a month, I also take apart each piece of the band and clean all the pins separately and put it all back together. Aside from a few stratches, still looks good as new"
4,Not Just Antother Hip Coffee Table Book,Pop Art: U.S./U.K Connections 1956-1966 is a great read for those facintated with the Pop Art movement. The color plates are really good and so is the writing. It's an informative look at the parallels between the Pop Art movement in the U.S. an the U.K. The book includes the icons of the era along with some lesser known artists and works. It presents an interesting perspective suitable for both the beginner and expert art enthusiast.
3,Too Much Bass,"If you are someone who likes an unnatural amount of bass coming from your speakers, these headphones are for you! There would never be a need to add bass boost because there is already too much! It's a pity, because otherwise these are excellent headphones. I noticed that in some of the reviews (under the versions of these headphones which come in various colors) that there were complaints of too much bass. Unfortunately, I did not read those reviews until after I ordered these headphones."
2,My son likes it BUT...,"We got this video for our almost 3 year old son for Hanukah. He really likes it but I'm not crazy about it at all. I don't like it's portrayal of the Greeks and the whole thing about ""pigstachio"" ice cream is ridiculous and completely inaccurate. I don't know what the people who produced this video were thinking. The singing dreidyl is also annoying, but I can tolerate that part. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
4,Rave Reviews from a 3 year old,"My son loved this DVD and so I have to buy it because I've already spent [money] on rental fees. The puppets are very cutesy, the songs are catchy and easy to learn. Exactly the kind of entertainment the target audience craves. So OK, it's not completely historically accurate, but I think it portrays the story and spirit of Chanukah so that my 3 year old understands it. Everytime the Grandma starts singing the blessing, he brings me into the room, sits on my lap and we bond. It's touching and sweet and silly and that's enough for both of us. It might twist some facts, but it does great with bringing the spirit of the holiday home. And its way more accurate than the Rugrat's version."
1,Digital Copy is NOT worth the extra money!!!!!!,"My husband purchased this for me and I am totally excited about watching it. BUT...as I try to download the digital copy, I find out the code is EXPIRED!!!!!!!!! I've had this dvd for all of 15 minutes and yet the digital code is not any good anymore. My advice is not the bother with the extra $$ for the digital copy because it is simply a waste of money."
5,The 13th warrior is a surprising movie,I never thought Antonio Banderas would make a viking movie let alone Omar Sharif. Add a cast that look like real vikings and Michael Chrichton's story telling and you have an adventure well worth watching over and over. a favorite.
4,English Rose was a compelling follow up (in North America) to their excellent debut,"English Rose finds Fleetwood Mac adding Danny Kirwan, a third guitarist, to the line-up. Horns also appear for the first time. Other than that this LP is a natural follow up to the band's excellent Chicago blues debut. Standouts are Kirwan's Something Inside of Me and Without You and, of course, the three Peter Green classics, Love That Burns, Albatross and Black Magic Woman. As one listens to Green wail on Magic it becomes crystal clear why both BB and Eric consider him to be one of the great guitarists.Had Fleetwood Mac not morphed into a mega pop band in 1976 they would still have occupied a significant position in the history of English blues. This version of the band was a supremely talented and confident gathering of musicians and as much as I enjoyed Fleetwood Mac when it became the biggest band in the world I have more affection for the various 1968-1973 versions."
5,Mac Attack,"This excellent album offers some of the best blues and features the incredible Peter Green at the helm. His song, Black Magic Woman, is, in my opinion, far better than Santana's (which is excellent). But the crowning jewel is the closing cut, Albatross. This haunting track soared to the top of the Englih charts in it's day and still has a mystical aura. Great album !"
4,Mickey Gilley Concert,I thought this would be a recent recording since his accident. It is a good recording of his hits but not recent. I know he was making a new recording last October of 2012 and I am looking forward to that one.
2,Not the original artists,I was a little disappointed when I realized that none of the songs were sung by their original artists. I purchased the CD with hopes of playing it during the ceremony and now I don't believe I will.
2,I wish I could hear the songs before I bought them,I like to be able to hear a song before I buy it. Please make it possible to hear them. Not just for me but for the other brides and grooms out there.
1,The Most Requested Wedding Songs ~ Various Artists,I would like to be able to listen to samples before I purchase. This is one of the albums that does not allow to listen to samples?
2,3 good tracks...thats it.,"there's about 3 good tracks on this cd, which isnt bad as far as 13.99 gets you. but once you've been spoiled by oakenfold, sasha and digweed, then 3 tracks just don't cut it. this cd is just a showcase for a couple of groups with multiple tracks on the cd. the mixing isnt extraordinary. wish the music selection was better."
1,Lakmé - poor recording,Poor recording. This CD is just a plain copy of an old vinyl disk.Not recommended.
4,A good intersting serie from Osprey,"The fortress serie from Osprey is quite interesting as it covers a topic only previously browsed by specialized books (and thus expensive). The ""U-Boat Bases and Bunkers"" is a good start for whom want to know a little more about those concrete pens. 3D illustrations and present day pictures of the unbreakable survivors illustrate this book. The only drawback is that it lacks some infos about civil engineering (concrete technology, jobsites evolutions,..) and about the norvegian sites."
2,unimpressive scholarship and way-out-on-a-limb reasoning,"I see I'm clearly in the minority here, having a negative opinion of this work, but ""that's what makes a ball game,"" as they would've said in the '30s. Our humble prof has culled scant evidence from a few scratchy glyphs on a Roman coin that's more aerugo than coin and subsequently woven a richly detailed tapestry of arguments and counter-arguments. Were the author as knowledgeable in ancient numismatics (not to mention, ancient astrology) as one is led to believe, he would require a whole lot more than a ram with a vague star over one shoulder to construct so detailed an argument. What we have here is truly a silk purse woven from a sow's ear. Now, pray tell, what will the Dr. Molnar make from Mme. Hog's other ear?"
2,Not engaging,"It is of course interesting to wonder what might have been the astronomical event that was interpreted as the Star of Bethlehem. But Molnar's prose style is plodding, and I found myself losing interest. I would have preferred a livelier account."
5,science validates faith's teachings,"I found this book a fascinating explanation of what I had been taught thru faith to believe. Molnar explains how the magi came to find and follow the star that had been prophecized to lead them to a ""superKing"" By looking at the prophecy thru the eyes of ancients as they thought, one comes to understand in modern terms something that one grew up instructed to accept on faith alone. By seeing the world thru ancient eyes one can understand its modern interpretation. This is a fascinatating book for scientist, theologist and just the average reader. Secure on solid academic and historical grounds, it is nonetheless a great read!"
2,Not a very good item,Bought this for my 14 year old kid and it didn't last more than a month. Won't buy this item again.
1,Maybe the worst tech book ever,"As stated in a previous review, there are publishing errors that unforgivable. For instance layout problems make Chapter 6 almost unreadable.I got to page 62 before reading anything worthwhile. I could go on. . .I had grown to distrust this publisher, and now I remember why."
1,This book's sell-by date has long since passed,"I don't think anybody is still using Microsoft CRM version 1.0, so be sure the title you choose covers the version of CRM you need, which is probably version 3 or 4 at this date."
1,Waste for your Money,It is just wasting for the money. Nothing special about this book. you are better reading the help file which come with CRM software. Beside the help file is more organized by providing the steps in order.
3,Simplistic style; designed for beginners only,"There are some good ideas in this book, and some good examples of where to take one's writing. But, the author's style is like a combination of Mr. Rogers and Richard Simmons: Can you write fillers? Of course you can! How about a column? Let's get to it! Ever think about writing for children? Why not!It's a dizzying series of simple questions, followed by text meant to inspire and get one started in writing. There isn't a lot about the actual process of getting published; mostly, it's words of wisdom from an established author, with suggestions on what areas to dig into and what to expect from certain markets. I didn't get a lot out of this book, mostly because I already know what I want to write.If, however, you are a beginner beginner, or in high school, or simply want to write but have no idea what, then this book might be for you."
4,A great help for those who are starting to write,This book is very informative for those who want to get some ideas on what to write and how to write.I would recommend this book for people who are writing short stories or children's books.How much you get out of this book depends on your perceptions and ideas.
5,When A child Cries,"i know Jacob personly he is a great guy. He can sing reall good by his first CD. Looks and feels like it will hit it big in no time. i'm going to give it a 5 on the rating scale,and thats really good on my rating scale.Cause i am really picky on my music that i listen to.Thats why i hope they make it big.This is one of the songs that i listened to. it made me think about stuff that was happening in my life.i hope his group hits it big. i give them mad props on this song"
2,Not by who you think.,This book is not written by the famous canadian author Jane Jacobs who wrote classic _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_ but instead by an identically named individual. The book is interesting but not in the same league was the Canadian Jane Jacobs.
1,Not a wise choice,"This product is fine if you want to replace items for your Fuji gun but a far better product is found in accuspray guns. I wish I had not spent good money after bad. A 1 star is plenty when I think how this gun sprays. There is not enough control over the spray pattern like Accuspray has, at least not to my satisfaction. It's priced far too high to choose over Accuspray."
5,Laughter from the first hole to the 18th,"Hilarious quote books. It's all here--Chi Chi Rodriguez, Lee Trevino, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, John Daly, etc. Of course I'm prejudiced since I am the author, but it is a very enjoyable book. If you would like more info about this book or any of my other books, please log on to glennliebman.com. Thank you."
3,It's ok,"I found this book a bit simplistic at times. Also, I wish it was better organized.Info is useful for review, though."
5,Perfect Gift,"We bought this as a gift for somone who has everything. Everything, that is, except this plant. They absolutely LOVED it. For the price, it's pretty amazing that you can have something this nice delivered to someone's doorstep."
3,I killed it,"I watered this plant too much and transplanted it too soon. The result of such inappropiate care, killed the plant. It was beautiful when I got it. My thumb definitely isn't green!"
5,Anthurium with volcano rock,"My third of these. Stunning plant, and a wonderful addition to our home. The second was a gift to a person who loved the one in my office. The plants were well packed and in excellent shape even traveling in the cold. The new plants were blooming at the time of receipt. Thank you!!"
5,GREAT PRICE & GREAT DEAL,"Beautiful and far exceeded my expectations! Having a living plant shipped to me, I wan't sure what kind of condition it would arrive in. It arrived totally intact and beautiful right out of the box. It had 3 hearty, red ""blooms"" and about the time one of them starts to die off, another one starts to emerge. Living in Seattle, I wasn't sure how a plant from Hawaii would survive. It's not only surviving but it's absolutey thriving and with very little care. I'm thinking about having a few shipped as gifts to a couple of friends in different parts of the country. Also, the price is great. In fact, I saw this same exact red, Bonsai, lava-rock plant (same height) advertised in a catalog---for $55.00 + S&H. The picture and description was exactly the same as Amazon's. This is a great deal. Get it. You'll love it!"
2,Not as wonderful as expected,"I am a grade nine student and I feel like this book could be better. It is mainly centered on Europe and the order of the book makes it more confusing than it needs to be. For example, in one paragraph, the book will talk about a ruler that died in 645 B.C. In the next chapter, it will continue to talk about the already deceased ruler, and what he did 20 years prior. If you can handle this, order away. If just that confuses you, I'd stay away from this one."
3,Lewis and Clark,"If the author of this book left out the words LEWIS AND CLARK tbis book would have been 200 pages shorter. I nearly put this book down in the beginning because of this monotony but glad I didn't because it became an enjoyable read with lots of interesting facts and trivia about roads, motels, people and early days of travel."
2,Waste of time,"I heard the author on NPR and thought the book sounded promising. I expected to discover a wonderful family experience of four people locked for days in a car; I really wanted to know these people. I expected an enjoyable trip. Instead, Mr. Sullivan gave me a synopsis of every book he'd read about Lewis and Clark, and more trivia than I wanted to know. This author even turned a brother/sister backseat conversation about Barbie into a mindboggling trivia fact sheet. Mr. Sullivan, I wanted to know you and your family; instead, I'm afraid I learned only about you. Frankly, on a road trip, you're a bore."
2,Cross Country,"I wanted to like this book---I really did. In fact, I wanted to like it so much that I kept plodding all the way to the end despite the fact that I found it boring most of the time. I love books about cross-country travel, but this one had so much of what I considered just ""padding"" to fill pages. There were a few gems in the book, but not enough for me to recommend it to someone. It's as if he felt a compulsion to record all of his thoughts regardless of how inane they were or how meaningless they would be to the reader. The book represents a great concept poorly executed."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book because I was considering a road trip and was looking for inspiration: the 15 yrs and 90 000 miles part of the title led me to believe the author would have a lot to share. Instead I found myself wading through details too personal to empathise with (why should I care that Multnomah Falls is special to you because you once met a woman in an New York elevator wearing a Multnomah Falls belt?), underwritten by endless references to Lewis & Clark (if I'm as interested in them as you assume, wouldn't The Journals of Lewis & Clark be a better purchase?).Yes, driving for miles on road trips can be dull, but there's an art to reflecting that in an interesting way that engages the reader. Like the reviewer above notes, it's as boring as watching someone else's home movies, and indeed as annoying as a road trip that gets off at every exit."
4,Decent Book About One Man's Travels,"This book has a most eye-catching cover, but the writing does not live up to the promises made on the book flaps. Robert Sullivan has driven across the country dozens of times and writes of his experiencesThe best part of the book is the crude drawings and accompanying notations. This serves to make up for the uninspired writing that relates much about Lewis and Clark and service station coffee while not telling us the kind of interesting stories that the book flaps promised us. The writing is just so much hot air and endless details of his travels.Bottom line: Wait and see if this book makes your public library and if it does, give it a look."
2,Cross Country,The author jumped around too much in his narrative. It was hard to follow and the characters were not developed very wellI was disappointed.
1,Too many words,More thn I cared to know about the author's thoughts about himself. Needs to be cut by half.
2,"Long descriptions, short ride","I was looking forward to this book as I love driving and I loved this author's last book, Rats. The author packs his family into a rented car and drives across the continent while musing about the history of American roadtrips, starting with Louis and Clark and ending with his own. Unfortunately, it's quite a rambling book, and it would be hard to imagine anyone but a well-known writer being able to pass this off to a publisher. Frankly, most travel blogs are better written than this. Still, there's a lot of interesting trivia that he spouts while driving his family (and readers) batty with his incessent ramblings about spilt coffee and other things too minor to warrent writing a book about. I'll grant him this: don't think I'll ever look at a Holiday Inn or coffee lid the same way again."
4,Fun in Del Sol,"Only Dave Samuels knows how to tap great melodies out of those Vibraphone/Marimba sticks. The music moves from slow to fast-paced; frisky to haunting; obtrusive to subtle; creating a truly tropical holiday feel as hinted by the title ""Del Sol"". The opening track ""Conquistador"" is a great start but I specifically like ""Sand Castles"" and Samuels' duet with Andy Narell on ""Dance Class"" a real gem on this album. The title track is in a class of its own. This is an ecletic album for all seasons and will easily complement most any desired mood for the listener.Arthur A. Madonsela >> South Africa"
4,Ace the A+ exam with this book.,"I'm using Ed Tetz's book to study for my A+ exams, and I have found it to be very clear and easy to understand. The ""A+ Certification Bible"" is a fairly comprehensive technical computer book , that provides end of chapter multiple choice test questions. This book also includes simulate test questions on a CD-rom. It is also packed with pictures, diagrams, and descriptive learning objectives. This is a great book for computer owners and professional technicians alike. It has large easy to read type, is well illustrated . This is a great book to help you ""ace"" the A+ exam. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Well presented and comprehensive,"The A+ Certification Bible is an addition to the rapidly expanding bookshelf of study guides which aim to address the new A+ objectives set out by the compTIA.Each chapter within this book, targets specific objectives by providing comprehensive information on the relevant technologies, end of chapter questions, scenarios, and a number of lab exercises.By injecting an element of personality into its text, avoiding technical waffle and making liberal use of photos and diagrams, the A+ Certification Bible is as pleasurable to read as it is informative.Due to its comprehensive and accessible content I recommend this book as an essential purchase for those who want a resource which will serve as a useful reference in the future as well as providing the necessary knowledge to pass the A+ exams."
4,Worth the Money,"I bought this book, along with the A+ Passport by Mike Meyers and passed both tests with no problem. With any cert test real world experience helps but with these two books, even a complete newbe could pass. The test software with the book was pretty solid, I've seen worse."
2,not so good,"you will have to take a lot of pills just to reach the recommended dosage. you can try it, yes, but for me, it was not really effective."
1,Is for beginers,"I didn't feel more energy, I didn't lost weight, I went to the gym five times per week, and eating the same, this product don't suppress appetite; I weight 240 pounds, I had used best product than theses one, is like for beginners.This product don't work like said with out exercise, even with exercise don't work."
2,Stopped working,"My son received this for his birthday just a few weeks ago. It no longer works on a regular basis. We have replaced the batteries and it still only works occasionally, my son now thinks he ""can't do it"". I gave it two stars instead of one because my son can be hard on toys, we don't know if this toy is poorly made or just can't hold up to a three year old's rough play."
4,Very mixed feelings,"As I began to read these poems, I found the author's extensive use of parenthetical phrases to be an irritating device that made the meaning of the poem elusive. However, the same jarring use of syntax (words rather than phrases) is a significant reason that the poem The Sibyl works very well. His renderings (translations from Greek) are splendid poetry. In short, in this volume I found a range from poems I found unneccesarily opaque to absolute gems, everything from meditations on what it means to be gay and moral to studies of Greek gods. This is a book that each reader must decide for themselves if this is a book for them - some will love it, others will not - and both will be fair accessments."
5,Hilarion is a fun read,"To the four men of Linsk, having Hilarion join them from the Old Country may or may not be good news. The men of Linsk were older and wiser and used to the ways of the city but times were hard and they didn't know what to make of this cheerful young giant named Hilarion. Certainly he was lucky - for Hilarion the streets really did seem to be paved with gold. It was Hilarion who rescued the Mayor and foiled the bank robbers. Rewards awaited him, powerful friends had offers of jobs, but there was always something more important that he must do first. Was this the way for a penniless lad to behave? Why wasn't Hilarion more sensible? And yet in the end, everything did go right for Hilarion and the men of Linsk."
1,Was this a love story?,"I picked this book up in an airport to read during an international flight that lasted over 9 hours. However, the book was so shallow that it couldnt even hold my interest long enough to finish it within 9 hours. Another reviewer hit it on the head regarding the 2-dimensionalism of the characters.Shadow (the female lead) still pines away for her first love. However, the author doesnt provide any character or past detail to make this even remotely believable. Therefore, his role as an antagonist or heartfelt love is zero.Also, with this book you have to pay real close attention. Major story elements for which one would normally expect the book to elaborate on does not happen. Some examples are Shadows capture, her past with her father, her relationship with her sisters etc. etc..The author takes more time with secondary chacter relationships which are not interesting enough to be worthwhile."
1,"Not a western, just another romance novel","I was disappointed when I found this was just a romance novel dressed up in Western clothing. All the time and attention is on feelings,sex and antisapation of sex. Change the names and location and it is just like all the rest."
2,Ugh.,"This book was painful to finish. I kept hoping that it would get better (it didn't). As others have mentioned, there were too many storylines that were completely undeveloped, apparently in a deliberate attempt to get you to read prequels and sequels.However, the worst part of the book for me was the ""character"" of Bayleigh Stewart, a/k/a ""Shadow."" Her character was completely annoying, as she seemed to behave completely inconsistently and irrationally. For example, when a misunderstanding arises between Bayleigh and the hero, Long Quiet, rather than explain her situation and clear up all the problems, Bayleigh keeps ""forgetting"" to talk to him, or missing her opportunity. Very clumsily handled overall; none of the characters are believable in their motivations or behaviors.Also, no author should use the word ""manroot"" in what is intended to be a serious love scene. I actually laughed out loud."
3,Just didn't draw me in,"I tried to like this book, but I felt like I came into it with the story already half told. Perhaps I should have read Frontier Woman first, since it told of Bay's kidnapping and her history. I just didn't feel like I got to know the characters; they seemed 2 dimensional. It also didn't make sense that Long Quiet was so in love based upon his glimpse of Bay in Boston. I wanted to know why he loved her so. I found this book hard to finish."
5,Where can I meet Long Quiet?,"Loved this book. The best of the Stewart sisters books. Joan Johnston made Bay just gentle enough for not to be a weakling, just strong enough so that she is not manly and just loving enough so Long Quiet wanted no other woman. The Long Quiet character came alive on paper so that it made me want to meet him. Loved, loved it."
3,EXHAUSTING---,"More ups and downs than a roller coaster--too exhausting getting through it. Instead of thinking, ""Wow, I'm glad I read that;"" I thought, ""Wow, I'm glad that's over."""
5,Buy It!,SanDisk makes a great product! This is the third SD card I've bought. Each one for a different camera. All work great! BUY THIS!!
5,Memory card,"Very satisfied with this product. Works well, is fast and dependable. I use it in my digital camera. A good product, from a good company."
5,Pleased.,"This product arrived as promised,is exactly what I ordered. Very pleased. I will order this again when I need another memory card. Can't beat the price!"
1,DOA. Couldnt write any data,"I have never had any problems with any previous sandisk products, but this would not allow any data to be written to it without an error. Tried reformatting and various card readers, no luck."
2,Not a genuine ULTRA II Sandisk card,"Have been using this card for two months, it works well, no errors, no lost files, etc.However, the advertised speed for SD Ultra II series is around 10MB/s reading and 9MB/s writing. This card does not go over 2.85 MB/s in either case. Additionally, it doesn't look like SD Ultra II 4GB shown on Sandisk.com.At this price, I guess it is not a bad deal, however, it is as slow as my old 2GB No-name SD card."
5,Big and Fast,"For a memory card it's big and fast, just what I need for my Canon G8 camera. So far so good."
2,Too Thick,This device is too thick to use in my Canon XSi digital camera. I compared it to an older SD and it is definately thicker.
1,"Poor Quality Control, Poor Service","My SanDisk 4GB SDHC card failed after nine months (with just 47 stored pictures). Was the company apologetic and eager to honor their 5-year guarantee? Not in the least. Their website makes it hard to find the return merchandise authorization (RMA) process; I wasted 70 minutes in online chat with a clueless drone who wanted the card failure verified on a card reader; her promised call by a supervisor never came; and my subsequent RMA process by email involved several confusing, redundant messages. And, after most of them: This transaction is now closed; please fill out our customer satisfaction survey. Either the staff can't read idiomatic English or they just don't care. Maybe phone is the way to go. I did get a replacement card, but will avoid SanDisk from now on."
4,Return to Solaris 7,"It has been quiet awhile since anyone has written anything on Solaris 7 and a good break from Coleman's Capellan stories. For those of you who like The Game World this os the book to buy, the story contains many classic battle's and eventually turn's into a Steiner vs Davion battle outside the arena's and into the street where, the press treat and highlight as though it was an arena match. Overall this book is brilliant, and enjoyable and should be considered for your collection."
2,My least favorite,"I love the mechwarrior series of novels, but this one was awful. The story was ludicrous and if the main character was as good as he appears to be then he probably would never have ended up the situation he did. Let's leave the cappelans alone, and all the other filler novels, and get back to the Grey Death Legion, and Victor Davion, and the Word of Blake on Earth, and the Clans, and the Wolf's Dragoons, and Phelan Kell, and all the other fun and interesting aspects of the Mechwarrior series. To say the least, this last novel was a dissapointment!"
4,Wonderful read,"Being a great fan of the BattleTech Universe, I was hoping for a book that would grip my imagination enough to prevent me from putting it down. This book does just that. Coleman doesn't simply slap the storyline and facts down for you to plough through, he actually molds the plot and the characters throughout the book. This gives it a whole and rounded feeling. There was only one problem - it was over too quickly! I could have read another 500 pages, but they just weren't there. Bigger book next time, LC?"
5,EWF FOREVER!,"This Group is all that.Their isn't another Band Like them.The music,Production,Arrangements&Feel Good Vibe are Incredible.These Songs are Timeless.So Many Music Styles that still blows the Mind to this day Very Essential."
2,Product displayed and description was incorrect,Product was in good condition and was in original parts box from Ford. But the description said that it was a Fuel Tank Sender including level sensor and fuel pump assembly. What arrived was just the fuel level sensor part. Other than description of the part being incorrect part is in good working condition.
3,A good basic guide to negotiating the purchase of an RV,"The book does get a little bit into the basics, ex. trailer types etc... Overall, it gave some good insight into when/how to negotiate a good deal on an RV. The book motivates the RV shopper to be brave about asking for the price he/she wants. However, if you are looking for specific retail/wholesale prices, they aren't in here.There was also some good information which helps buyers to know what to look for in an RV. (ex storage, food prep areas, size of bath etc..) The checklist in the back of the book looks fairly complete and should be helpful."
1,Nothing Outstanding,"Frankly, for a book on how to buy RV's, I was disappointed. In one of his chapters on what to advoid, Don launches into a multipaged bashing of two ethnic clans that hustle unsuspecting people with sales of poorly constructed RV that are made in IN. This was not advice, it was pure racism."
1,"Buy the professional stuff instead, Gila is a waste of money","I installed professional tint from SunTek as a first time beginner and it went up well.I decided it's not that hard and wanted to save money, so I tried Gila's. What a nightmare! Gila's tint is thin and brittle, so it's very difficult to handle and when you get it installed it looks like the cheap tint that people have on old car. Go for professional tint and ask Gila and Amazon to stop selling this junk."
3,Gave up after several pages,"Spanish is not my native language, but I have read several books in Spanish. This book was impossible. There were several words on every page that weren't in my Spanish-English dictionary. Sergio Ramirez is like the Spanish William F. Buckley. I gave the book to my friend from Colombia."
1,"Unrateable , but zero stars is not an option...",Don't bother with this book. You will have better luck simply using the Help in excel. This book provides less information in an awkward and minimally informative format.
2,impulse buy,I quickly ordered 3 of these as gifts without realizing that they were only instrumental karaoke type CDs. Thank goodness that I was able to retrieve 2 out of the 3 before they were opened. I had to return them but did keep one that was opened. Disappointment!
5,"I've tried them all, and this is the best","I've tried all sorts of filter wrenches. Regular aluminum strap wrenches, one with a chain, one that slips over the filter and you use a wrench on it.... They are all fine and dandy if you can actually get them on the filter. This thing has a swiveling handle, which allows it to work fantastically on all vehicles."
4,A few too many wars,"I am a much bigger fan of tales of derring-do and individual bravery than battle overviews. While I had read or heard of many of the stories, the author provided new insights into the tales of bravery. The author has a comfortable writing style making the book not a page turner, but an easy and interesting read somewhere between the styles of Stephen Ambrose and Clay Blair. The book would have been benefited from a few changes. The maps were too few and too simplistic. The author also should have either increased the number of conflicts he drew his stories from or limited them to the World Wars. For example, I liked the stories about the Israeli armed forces, but I just felt that they didn't fit with the overwhelming focus on the two larger wars. In sum, a good but not great book."
1,Sad,"Based on this book I can tell the author had a lot of anger towards the treatment of black woman. If only she would take the time to discover that no matter how bad society or men of color will treat you, there is a way that you can still be happy in life."
2,The Angry Black Woman's Guide to Life,"I picked up the book thinking it would give me some profound insight to life as an African American woman. I finished the book thinking how much of a waste of time it was. If you're looking for a book to just make you laugh, you may be impressed. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,This Angry Black Woman Guide to Writing a Stupid Hateful Book,This book was so ridiculously stupid. I think that a white woman would've written a better book and that's sad. I don't think the women that wrote this book even graduated from high school. Do not buy this book cause it will make you even angrier.
2,Not Bad but Not Great,Thsi book was just okay. It was an easy read which was good. Take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend it. I purchased it with the intention of finding some really inspiring information to pass along to my fellow sisters. Its a good social circle book to pull out if you're gathered with your girls and want to chill and laugh a bit. A bit adolescent.
5,"""Tell Like It Is""",The authors of The Angry Black Woman's Guides To Life tell what it is really like to be a black woman and what it takes to keep an a black woman happy. Together these three write an expectantly well thought of book that encourages woman of all races & ethnics.
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap Cheap,That goes for the seller to. Got my necklace and it was so aged and tarnished I didn't even take it out of the package for fear it would crumble in my hands. Got a return number from Amazon and returned product postage verified (it was received) and seller never gave me credit. Amazaon was also unable to assist. Now I know why ebay does so much better. Was going to purchase a kindle but now that I see how bad the Amazon really feels about there customers I spend a few extra bucks for the Ipad. Will be contacting BBB LA about StarWorld Toys. Bad Company.
1,cheap product,"Not pleased at all with product. Does not look anything like picture on site. Very cheap looking. Very, very disapointed with product. Do not reccommened buying this product."
3,Spendy for what you get,"I received the Pirates of Caribbean souvenir necklace and medalion in very quick time. It just was not as impressive in real life as the photo in the ad. It's okay, just not great for the price."
2,Poor Chain,"I had one of these before but it was from another maker ofcourse, the one i had was the correct size, it had markings on both sides and the quality was waayyy better. This one feels cheap, it's too light and the chains breaks extremely fast."
5,POC replica souvenir necklace,"Good quality replica of the necklace worn by Elizabeth Swann in the Movie Pirates of the Caribbean, The Black Pearl. Great memorbilia to have if you loved the movie."
1,I wonder what could have been...,"This is damn near unlistenable. It won't ever be played again. It's like they took what might have been a good mix/mash and destroyed it on purpose by sending through some assinine chain of effects boxes. There's so much distortion and bit-rate manipulation that you can't tell what's going on underneath. And that's the problem, you can't hear the music. Art is art, whatever, but this just isn't fun to listen to. It's not thoughtful, playful, deep, or anything else, it's noise for the sake of noise.I gave Night Ripper 5 stars but I can't in good conscience recommend this whatsoever."
1,Early efforts which appear accidently recorded.,"Simply put - don't buy this CD.In a time long ago, before mash-up was anywhere close to what it was today - this may of been an intriguing album.But as all the other reviewers pointed out, different then Greg's latest efforts - this CD is basically un-listenable.I don't fault Girl Talk. Relevant to the music at the time and the glitch scene in general, this may of been an interesting listen.But today, with the hindsight we now have, this CD appears to be something that never should of been recorded and released.Save your money and support this amazing artist in a different way."
1,terrible,"All the other Girl Talk albums are awesome. This one is terrible. It sounds like a CD player skipping. I just purchased all the albums because I thought they were all as good as night ripper. This is $9 completely wasted, I'm deleting it off my computer. Terrible."
5,Feel...,"...the noise. I hope Greg comes out with another just like it only more songs. Bring on the mix (Night Ripper), bring on the glitch (Unstoppable), and bring on the noise (Secret Diary)! He does it all...SO SO SO SO well!"
1,Hard To Believe How Bad This Is,"Oh my God, I can't believe how right all the other reviews are. I'm listening to ""What If..."" right now and cringing as I write this. In fact, I'm going to have to finish this review ASAP so I can cut this track short. This album sounds like a half-finished bunch of mixes--like Girl Talk was working on it, lost interest, and just published a bunch of random nonsense that grates on your ears exactly (as a previous reviewer compared this to) like a skipping cd. Awful, awful, awful (but Night Ripper still rules). Now, where is my delete key for these terrible MP3s?"
4,bitches need to stop hatin so much,"Seriously, he is a highly experimental artist, who can blame him for his first album not being up to par to his flawless last couple albums. Of COUSE Night Ripper is better, but I like him letting his glitch side go off for a bit. You can tell his skills are not what they are now, but if you can get past the lack of melody, you have to respect this album. It was made before he was famous and it lead him into his present endeavors. The whole point is that it is not a fluid work, but choppy and experimental. Take it for what it is, don't say it sucks because it is not the same thing you initially fell in love with."
1,Messed up,"I love Girl Talk and have multiple albums. This one is messed up. I'm pretty sure it's an issue with the recording/download, but if it isn't an error, I HATE that I spent any money on this. It is impossible to listen to! I listen to Girl Talk (almost exclusively) when I workout and can't listen to anything from this album! Amazon, can you see if there is a recording error on this and allow us to redownload so that it's something that can actually be listened to?"
2,Girl Talk - Secret Diary,"SECRET DIARY is Girl Talk in embryonic form -- the mash-ups here are more akin to Kid606 than the smooth segues that Girl Talk would be known for, so things sound a little rough. 2 Unlimited's ""Get Ready for This"" crashes into on ""Let's Start This Party Right,"" while ""I Want You Back"" seems to be a grab bag of chopped vocals without much direction... at least until the MJ appears. The album is unabashedly glitchy and washes out some samples in layers of noise, such that there's barely anything recognizable on ""Ffun Have To"" or ""Time to Get Glamourous."" He does show his sense of humor in juxtaposition on ""What If..."", however, smooshing Joan Osborne with some ghetto rap. It's 50% more sacrilegious! The New Kids on the Block get similar treatment on ""The Right Stuff."" Elsewhere, the Price is Right theme gets mangled on ""Unicorn vs. Gravity"" and Destiny's Child is whupped on ""Jumpin(g)."" You can see the seeds here, but they've not yet sprouted."
3,African Instruments,"The rhythmkids musical ball is interesting, and looks okay in my collection. But the quality is very poor. I normally allow my students to play most of my instruments, but I was afraid to allow this particular one to be handled very much. Even I will have to be careful using it. I do not recommend it for kids, unless they are very well behaved and respectful of important items."
4,Introductory Econometrics,"I'm using ""Introductory Econometrics"" for review, and in that respect it's very thorough. But it can also be used, as the title asserts, as an introductory textbook.Mr. Wooldredge is very practical, as he keeps the topics at the ""applied"" level. He includes just enough theory to help in understanding how and why the model works, and he keeps repeating what every econometrician knows: econometrics is problematic in application. Keep it as a reference after you finish the class.One can also get the database that Mr. Wooldridge uses (as well as several others) by going to the Wake Forest University website and downloading a free copy of the econometric software package, ""Gretl."" Gretl will handle any econometric models in ""Introductory Econometrics."""
4,Excellent for cross-sectional but needs complements for time series,"As the author says, the book is ""aimed at undergraduates but it is adaptable to master's students"". It will provide you with excellent and extensive real life explanations. What is better about this book is that you can redo every example in the book by using the online data that it provides with. This was it is easier what happens by experimenting. In that sense this book is superior to many others where you cannot see how the results of estimations came about.There is only one thing to take into account. Although there are three parts to this book, the shortest one is time series. Its coverage will is therefore not very comprehensive if you want basic explanations like the VAR, GARCH models etc...In that case, I would recommend the book New Directions in Econometric Practice by Wojciech W. Charemza."
1,Lemon?,I bought this television right after Christmas last year (2000). Within two weeks it stopped working entirely. I returned it and got a second one. Two days ago (slightly over a year later) the second one stopped working entirely....no power...nothing.
1,Think twice,First price was steep for one piece. Second... A lil false advertising. They show you a multi-piece set and only ship you one. So please think first before you buy!
3,Decent simulation - waaaaay overpriced,"I bought this about 1 week before I took the exam and the questions were useful to the test the simulation score from the test were pretty close to what I got on the exam. However, the price of this CD is atrocious. There are comparable resources out there for way less money. But - if money is not an issue - content-wise - it is a good simulation and should give you confidence going into the exam."
5,A Reviewer,This the best available prep out there. It is bit expensive but I would definitly recommend for all those who want to score in the exam. It will allow you to understand the improvment areas as the end results are displayed by breaking the score into various knowldge areas.
4,"Generally well done, but like the subject, lagging in the en","This book was a marvelous read. The author kept my interest throughout the first two-thirds of the book. However, he does deal blandly with Grant's political career. Overall though, quite touching and well done."
5,Best litte book on Boston to date.,"I have found more terrific places from this guide,,from the Marliav restaurant to shopping tips. I can tell alot of reseach went into this comprehensive book"
5,As good as Barbara Michaels!,"I could not put this book down!If you like Barbara Michaels, you will love The Divided Child! It has the perfect blend of suspense and romance, and I couldn't figure out exactly who the villain was until the very end. To me, that makes a great story!"
5,Very Good,This cd was the perfect alumb for my mom it helped pick out the best wedding sond ever it her day special and mines as well
4,Not Getting Lost In My Backyard! Or on the Back Roads.,"Just using the electronic moving compass feature helped plot out the boundaries of my lot of land. When I found all the corners, the Lat&Long; feature let me place marker post for a fence. It would be good/better if the altitude feature was more accurate, I could use it to make a topographical map of my land too. The reading I do get are just estimates (+/-40 ft).While on trips out of town, or out of state, having been to my destination at least once in the past w/ my 310, I can use the ETA feature(Estimate Time of Arrival) for getting there or coming back home.The 100 landmarks storage memory is well enough for my use. I have added several burger and pizza places to the list for fun."
3,Get The Magellan 315 - for a few dollars more - Worth it!,"I had purchased a 310 and a 315 because they run out of the Magellan 315. What a difference! To start the batteries do not run out that often, the 315 is more accurate somehow, dont ask me why; just comapring side by side the 310 even though a bit smaller seems less ""in the Game""I gave my 310 to my son, its a godd starter GPS, if you are serious about GPS handhelds, get the Magellan 315 for a few dollars more. Worth every penny!"
3,Happy,Works fine no problems----To many option---i like the armltron watch which has a glow like face---Worth the priceWell satisfies
4,pretty good inexppensive sports watch,generally satisified with this watch.This is a plain basic watch that works well and is fairly simple to set and operate.I was a little disappointed when I saw that the watch was made in 2005 and I'm afraid the battery may be a little stale.
4,Simple and works effectively,This is a simple to use multifunction watch. The flip mode of watch does not work and the indiglo mode is ot powerful enough. But all other functions work perfectly. I am satisfied with this product.
5,Great watch,This is my second Ironman watch of this type. My first one died after a battery replacement when water got inside due to the incompatance of the place that replaced the battery. I am a mechanic and often wear the watch to work and haven't had any issues with dirt or oil getting on it or the band.The best thing I like about the watch is the ease of changing the time come daylight savings time.
3,"This is a great watch, but NOT a Flix watch.","The rating is reflective of labeling (either Timex fault for serial number or Amazon for the incorrect description/image of the product with ""Flix"" on dial.)Any Timex Ironman is a great watch. But after getting one from Amazon, realizing it doesn't have Flix, then returning it and getting another one (identical, no FLIX), I am pretty sure it has been mislabeled.If you are buying for all the features except FLIX, it is a great price, and an excellent watch. If you are buying for Flix, better choose the more expensive models. The T5H591 is not a FLIX watch."
3,timex ironman watch,I like the watch for its ease of use. I owned a previous model so I was very familiar with its operation. The only drawback is the black triathlon logo on the face. It interferes with reading the numbers on the face of watch
4,tough battery change,"I agree good watch but very difficult changing the battery.I tried, thought it was succesful until I went swimming and had a water leakthe water seal moved while I was trying to shove the lid back on.The watch is now ruined due to the water leak.Next time I will spend money going to a watch shop to change the battery."
4,Great watch. Band could last longer,"This is my second watch. It is great for the price and not to big. But, the band did not make it to 2 years. Previous Timex watches, the band lasted much longer. Usually through 2 batteries."
5,love this watch,"This watch is awsome. Never fails me i use it during practice when running, during cross country races and even at work. Its definatelty water proof and very durable."
2,Watch Band Broke in Less Than A Year,I purchased this watch for my 13-year old son and after less than a year the watch band broke. Yes he did wear it everyday but he took good care of it well and never abused it. I am disappointed with the watch as now i have to replace it.
2,Mine broke...twice,"Don't waste your time. I had two. They both fell apart in about the same time. Common symptoms to expect: face plate falls off, buttons stop working, buttons fall off, wrist band breaks, light stops working. Life span: max 1.5 years. I don't know about you, but for $50 a watch should last longer than that. Both of mine kept bad time too, and I had to keep adjusting the time so I wouldn't be late. Oh yeah, and the buttons are hard to press. Like I said, don't waste your time..."
2,dont buy!!,"the dial disappears when u tilt the watch, i have to adjust my wrist to read the dial,,, the strap wont last a month!!"
5,An awesome deal!,"I think the Timex Ironman watch was an excellent value! And, the fact that it came with a sports bottle made it even nicer! I gave it to my son-in-law for Christmas, and he was very pleased (and still is!). Thank you Amazon!!!"
2,Too too fancy,I was disappointed when I received this cookbook. It reminds me more of a free giveaway from the grocery store. It is now somewhere in the back of my cupboard or in the next yard sale.
5,Must Have,This book needs to be in every parent's library. It is a tool that every parent can use to protect their children by teaching them what is right and wrong when it comes stranger danger...
1,Terrible,"I guess if you are 12 years old and like an annoying singer/songwriter making fun of a legendary singer/songwriter, then this album would be great for you. Most of us, however, are tired of these pop punk bands that all sound the same....bad. There is a lot of great and original music out there, and this album is not part of that group."
3,Great condition,"The book was in excellent condition, but I was disappointed in the format of the book itself (no pictures). I like to see what how my recipes should look when finished."
1,I give this one star only because I have to.,"While this book had cute pictures, that's about the ONLY thing it had going for it. The book sounded much too mechanical to be enjoyed and it didn't, in any way, capture the true essence of the movie. I don't recommend buying this to read for a small child because it will be a huge disappointment."
1,How badly written can a book be?,This book is so badly written it is unbelievable! How could any publisher allow this book to be published? Didn't an editor review it? Didn't Disney hire an accomplished writer? Disney should be ashamed of itself for publishing so lousy a book. Especially when the movie was so good.
1,Absolutely Terrible!,"These were the speakers I included when I purchased new 2 new computer systems for my children, and both sets failed miserably. In both cases the problem was exactly the same - uncontrollable, LOUD, persistent static from the right speaker. As soon as they were turned on it began, like the static between AM radio stations. Sometimes it would pass after a while, but any attempt to adjust the volume only made it worse. It was so loud and so bothersome that the kids usually chose to play their games with the speakers turned off. After complaining, I got two replacement sets from the dealer but the problem was exactly the same. Even on the very rare occasion that they functioned properly, the sound quality was mediocre at best. What can you say about a product when four out of four sets fail? Don't buy them!!! In the end I threw them away and went with Creative SBS 380's on both computers (which sound terrific, btw)."
3,The Wreckers by ???,"This book is about a boy named John Spencer, 14, who goes in his father's ship for his first time. They pile up some mystery cargo and on the way back they are shipwrecked along the Cornish coast. Only John survives the wreck along with his father.My favorite part of the book is when he discovers the secret of the corpse lights. I liked the setting of this book and the character customization. The way the characters are described is excellent."
3,The Wreckers Review,"This review is for the book ""The Wreckers"". The book is a part of the series. ""The Wreckers"" is about a boy named John Spencer. He is stranded on the island of the wreckers from a ship crash. My favorite scene was at the end when he destroyed the false lights because that has the most action and dramatic impact on the story. I think it is for ages 9-12 because it is not hard to read. One literary device that the author used that was good was that he gave mystery into the book so you will want to read more. I like the book because it had drama and action in it. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it was too short."
3,interesting plot,"intreging plot,good characters. though the vocabulary was quite difficult to comprehend. im not a captain for gosh sake! overall, good but sorta ...(messed) up!"
4,This was a great book!,The Wreckers begins with 14 year-old John Spencer when he is with his father on the ship THE ISLE OF THE SKYE. Then they ship wreck off the coast of Cornwall. John thinks his father is dead so he tries to find help. You will find out a lot more when you read this wonderful and suspenseful book by Iain Lawrence.
3,Okay,"This book was okay. I thought it was very sad and discouraging. Don't give it to just any body, you should read it first, some might like it others not, for me it was okay."
5,Thrilling adventure,"Seventh grade English teacher here. I was looking for some extra reading to follow up a class read of Treasure Island. Although some of my students would have difficulty with the language in The Wreckers, I know many of them would love it. I was intrigued with the way Lawrence cast suspicion on all the characters so I didn't know who was trustworthy and who intended evil. In fact, I almost sneaked a peak at the end of the book because I was ao anxious to find out how the story ended. I'm planning to add this title to my classroom library."
4,Good not great,14 year old john and his father's crew sail the foreign areas. one dark night they are lead by false lights and crash. The area they crash on are evil families that steal the dead's possesions. i recomend this book for all ages. its a great book on a rainy day to read. this book is not perfect but it is worthwhile to try.
5,The Wreckers children's book,Saw the 3d book in this series while on the Bay Ferries to Nova Scotia. Thought my grandson would love the series but couldn't find the 1st 2 books Thanks to Amazon I was able to get the entire series for my 9 year old avid reading grandson.thanks again for the goodiesPatti
3,Bloody & morbid,"I started reading this book to my 5th grade son and although like other readers have stated, it does have the feel of a classic, it was too graphic in the handicaps of some of the characters and the murders of others. It is a rather depressing book. My son did not like it. I always enjoy learning something new, so for that fact, was glad to have read it."
2,Same Axe Grinded Endlessly,"I read 173 pages, but always it was depressing and helplessly distressing to read with the same axe to grind for page after page after page after page after page after page after page after page after page.Libertarian boolsheet spun on a single note over and over agani.319 pages"
4,Libertarian Candy,"A storeful of sweets for the libertarian mind. Every quick chapter has one nodding yep, yep, yummy, yummy. Of course I enjoyed it.However, I don't think the book is going to change the opinions of anyone who doesn't already agree with what is written within its pages. The syrup is quite thick in parts, scaring away potential converts. A little less back-patting and this would be a 5."
1,"Should be named ""Dreams Come Due: Government and Economics If Facts Are Ignored""","Read this book with Google handy. Plays fast and easy with facts. I suppose when you start with a fictitious author making up facts and quotes seems easier than all of that boring research. The writer seems to have started with theories and twisted or invented facts and quotes to support that point of view. I just wish I had thought of the idea first, great way to make money from people who want their point of view validated."
4,Another great HOPE installment,"If you want a summary, read the other reviews or the pubishers synopsis. This was a great book, as good or better than the first Hope installment. It makes great Christian statements about the results of judging people and how lives can change when love and compassion are freely given. This author is an excellent writer, has a real knowledge of Chrisian principles and a great story telling ability. I hope she keeps them coming."
5,"A Fun, Easy Read!","After reading the first book in this series I was quite anxious to find out what happened to the characters in Hope. I always feel disappointed when I get the second book in the series only to discover that it is nearly completely unrelated to the first novel. Well that was not the case with Prairie Fire. While we did get new characters, we also got to hear about the old ones we love, as well as how the town of Hope develops. If you enjoyed the first book in the series you will also love this one!"
4,I know the real town called hope.,there is a real Hope Kansas. I have trouble connecting the story to the real town which I visited from time to time while growing up in a neighboring town. But I was there in the 40's and am finding the fictional town of an earlier period fun to visit.
2,Battery charger broke.,"Everything is fine but after around six months of use, battery charger broke and I am finding it impossible to get a replacement one."
3,Eureka 96DZ Lite Upright Cordless/Bagless Vacuum,"This product is adequate for minor cleanups. Overall quality appears good. Longevity will only be determined after a period of time elapses and it is used enough. The only downside that we noted was that the vacuum required a determined effort to seat in its holder/charger to make electrical contact. A step backward from the older models! Overall, it appears to be a fair value for the modest investment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!,When I bought this vacuum I thought I was getting a great deal instead I got a piece of junk. I charged the battery and used it and it broke after two uses. It started to throw back the garbage instead of taking it inside. Next time I think I will stick to buying things from Target. At least you can return it to the store without paying any extra money for shipping it back.
4,Eureka,Great product for the money. Picks up most floor stuff in a kitchen with 2 small messy kids! Not the best for chunks or wet pieces. Good power for a cordless.
4,eureka,"Just the right size-picks up great and so easy to store and handle. Certainly beats a broom. The filter, as in every bagless cleaner, is difficult to clean and all the lint and fuzz has to be picked off by hand. A real downside to getting rid of a bag."
5,An excellent product .,This product is excellent for a quick and thorough cleanup of any type of floor that a broom can clean only better. It can clean area rugs and small mats as well. The cordless feature is good for about 15 minutes and I can clean my whole house in that time.
4,"Handy, dandy little vac","For quick pick-ups on either hard or carpeted floors, this little unit works very well. It is a cordless, so suction wise, it won't replace my central vac, BUT it works great for in-between cleanings. I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually work on carpeted floors (as this is the 4th cordless/stick vac I have tried) but it DOES! I have low - med pile carpet and it nicely picks up the cat hair and the little messes my toddler seems bent on leaving for me! You do have to bend down to turn it on/off and switch between roller off (hard floors) and on (carpet), but other than that, I have no complaints after using it for a few weeks. It is certainly A LOT lighter than my central vac or the regular vac I used to have."
2,Beware of hair,"I bought this product 2 years ago and it is overall, good at picking up all dust and crumbs, especially on carpets. However, as it picks up any hair, they immediately get rolled up in the roller. There is no easy way to get tangled hair off of the roller. I have to sit there and cut and pull off the dirty hair in order to keep the vacuum working well and the roller not full of hair. For people with short hair, I see how this wouldn't be a problem, but any woman knows that when you brush your hair you lose strands and they get caught in corners."
2,It didn`t impress me.,"I was disappointed wit this vac. Not as much suction as I would have like. And you have to hang the thing up to recharge it. The extra battery was a nice touch. For the money it might not be bad, but I wish I had spent a little more for a better vac."
2,Not made for carpet or large areas,"I had mine for two years. At the beginning it was great, but when I cleaned the whole house I had to recharge it in the middle of my cleaning. Also, even if you use it with the cord it won't work properly, it really needs to recharge for another hour or so. After the first year it would spill out the dirt on the carpet in the middle of my cleaning. I kept it clean but still it would spill out things, especially when you sit it to recharge. Concluding, it didn't work that well for me."
5,powerful and long lasting,"I admit..some of the reviews had me skeptical, but I needed a stick bagless vacuum with a power brush for my kitchen carpet. I took a chance, and WOW! I am very very pleased and would recommend this to everyone. It has awesome power for picking up the dog hair, and dirt from outside. I love this also for my steps in my living room! Very lightweight and easy to use!! The battery lasts pretty long throughout the whole cleaning of my steps and the kitchen. A+++++++++"
3,"works well, but . . .","This vacuum works well, but it doesn't hang well on the wall-mounted charger. You have to force it onto the hanger, which isn't good."
1,Disappointing suction,"It blows. It doesn't suck. Had to empty the ""dirt box"" all the time and still the suction was poor. I made sure to keep the battery well charged but the vacuum just didn't pick up the usual daily floor gromage."
5,Very Happy,We are very pleased with this product. It lived up to the advertising and we are really enjoying it.
3,it's ok for the price,"It sucks up dirt & dust ok. It seems to do fine with animal hair, but it has to be emptied constantly & it won't pick up a cheerio, period. Or a pea. Or any of the tiny food items that my baby throws on the floor which was why I bought it. So I am going to try to return it, it has been just about 90 days & I hardly even try to use it any more b/c I still have to go back over the floor with a broom &/or regular vacuum."
3,Dust everywhere when I empty it!,"It's light and convenient and cleans stairs and easy to lift up to clean upholstery even, but emptying the dust bin releases a cloud of dust everywhere. Wish I'd gotten a similar item with a bag to contain the dust!"
3,Just okay,I was hoping for more suction so that I would be able to do both the floor and the carpet under the table. It works okay on the floor but does not clean the carpet to get rid of small crumbs. It could use a much longer cord so that I would not need to unplug it and move it to do the whole room. It does do a great job for getting into the corners.
1,HORRIFIED- USED-BAG FULL OF DIRT-INOPERABLE,"Bought it 11-11-02 as Christmas gift for daughter-in-law.When she opened it last night and found it was used; bag full of DIRT, contact points burnt..VERY EMBARRASSING....TOTALLY UNHAPPY...DO NOT WANT REPLACEMENT...JUST TELL ME WHERE TO RETURN AT NO EXTRA COST AND WANT FULL REFUND PLUS ORIGINAL SHIPPING COST.C. G. MATHEWSFORT WORTH TEXAS"
2,Horrible - I don't understand high ratings,"I was tempted to leave one star just to bring down the average, but it's a two star in my experience.We bought this because we have a crawling baby on our hardwood floor and thought this would be ideal. It isn't. It's almost useless. We've boxed it up and are giving it away.Pros: light weight, two batter packs, easy to assemble, certainly picks up pretzel size and weight particles.Cons: Leaves behind lost of particles and all dust. Picks up even less if the particles are next to a wall.Will post a video if I can work it out. There's one spot along the baseboard of our entry doorway that collects larger dirty/paint/rock particles as shoes pass over it. The vacuum couldn't get one single particle up."
5,Great vacuum for the money!,I was about to go out to buy a $275 Kenmore to use in my 2 bedroom apartment. Fortunately a friend told me about the Eureka cordless she's been using for over 2 years and sent me to Amazon to check out the reviews. Well her recommendation and Amazon's saved me over $200 bucks. And the vac is just great. I'm amazed at how much dust and grit it picks up. I have mostly hardwood floors and some carpet in one BR and cover the whole place before the battery runs done. I recommend this product highly.
3,Cannot pick up a Cheerio...,"Bought this because of all the positive reviews here.This thing works FANTASTIC on carpets and mats. I really was impressed with how much dust/hair was picked up on carpet. Very good.On to bare floors....TERRIBLE. It works better with the motorized brush, but honestly it will push Cheerios around. You literally have to pick it up and set the unit directly on top of the cheerio!! I was really surprised how bad it was. I am not sure what the problem is, it seems like it is too low to the ground or something...?Great battery life, very light and great on carpets. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR BARE FLOORS. I am still searching for something that does bare floor better... But I was blown away at how good it does carpet...so overall not a bad product, just be aware of its strengths and weaknesses."
4,good litte machine,"Ordered this because of others' evaluations. Did as advertised and met my expectations. Would buy again. Good weight, easy to use. Do probably need good place to plug in and charge. Recommended."
5,Like it so much I bought one for upstairs,"First I must say this will not replace your current vacuum for its power. But, for quick clean ups this is great. I bought this primarily for cat and dog fur and the convenience of no cord. It does a great job on picking up all the fur both on furniture and carpets, bedspreads and even the dog bed.It cleans floors equally as well. Beats the broom and dust pan any day. Now vewry heavy objects like dog food do present a problem but that is not what I bought it for. It is as its name suggests for quick pick ups.I love this product and bought another for the upstairs because my arthritic knees make it hard to get up and down the stairs. I use it almost daily.The convenience of no cord and the fact that it is lightweight make it easy to taky anywhere."
1,I wouldn't waste the money.,"The only good thing about this vacuum is the option to buy a second battery, which you will need because a full charge doesn't even make it around a little 1600 sq ft area. The dust cup is easy to take out, which is also good because you will have to empty it every 5 minutes. And don't even think about emptying it inside your house, you will have dust EVERYWHERE! It loses suction very easily. All in all I wouldn't waste the money."
4,Great product!,"I got this vacuum about two weeks ago and used it twice, the amount of dust/hair/light bulb (yes all the broken pieces of a light bulb on tile floor) it picked up is impressive!"
5,Great for quick light pick ups...,"This vaccum does exactly what I need it to do. It lets me do a quick daily run through to pick up after my three kids. It works just as well on carpet as it does tile. Very easy to dump and clean. It comes with an extra battery so you are never hung out to dry when company is stopping by. It obviously wont eliminate the need to do a good deep vacuum cleaning every once in a while, but it has been a lifesaver for me, since I physically cant use our larger vacuum, and my husband isnt always home when I need it done. Its so lightweight that my 3 year old likes to use it :)"
4,Fairly satisfied...,"I have enjoyed my Eureka vacuum, but the ezine where I read about it (Tips du Jour), the lady that was touting it said that it comes with an extra, rechargable battery.I did not receive an extra battery with mine."
1,This vacuum is not for everyday use!,"Do not waste your money on this vacuum! If you plan on using this vacuum everyday and on more than one room, you will be disappointed. The materials are very cheaply made. I purchased mine about a year ago. I use my vacuum quite a bit, and have had to replace the battery (which will cost you about half the price of the vacuum itself) about every two months. The top part of the handle has broken off. This vacuum is not very good on hard floors if you are trying to pick up cat litter. You will have to go over it several times. This vacuum sounds good in the advertisements but don't be fooled!"
2,Not enough power,"I don't know, maybe it's just the one I got, but the thing doesn't really pick anything up. I mean, if you put your hand on the mouth you really feel a minimal amount of suction. This doesn't seem to agree with all the other reviews. I think I'll give Eureka a call just to see what's up."
4,"Cheap, Portable, and Simple","This vacuum is not made to work wonders such as a large full sized vacuum. It is a really quick and easy way to vacuum without having to untangle long cords. I used it more than my regular vacuum cleaner. I have a problem with crumbs and dust. After a quick pass in my room this vacuum cleaner was almost full! This is despite my other vacuum cleaner going through the area a week earlier.I also love the quick click off handle. It makes it easier to do upholstery, chairs, and the like.In the end this is a fantastic value and a simple solution for those that don't want to deal with the hassle of full sized vacuum cleaners for quick jobs."
4,Great vacuum,"Bought two of these vacuums for my kids, ages 4 & 7. They like to vacuum so Santa brought them these vacuums. Easy to use, light weight, comes with an extra battery, my kids have applied stickers to personalize and customize the glossy black plastic finish. And on top of that, the vacuum works well too. What more could I ask for?"
1,Very disapointed.,This vacuum has very little suction power. The brushes quickly became clogged up with fibers/hairs and we have no pets. Our carpet is relatively new.I don't recommend this product. Disappointing product from a company that produces the fine boss vacuum and a total waste of my money.Don't bother.
4,Good buy,"I have had several Eureka portable vacs.....this one is the best, powerful with a long battery life. A plus with the charger.....you can remove the battery and place it in the charger without putting the vac itself in."
3,6V battery doesn't last long,You only get about 10-15 minutes of cleaning time. The battery is used up quickly but works good on bare floors and short pile carpet. The battery pack has to be replaced because it won't take a charge and it's only 1 year old. I don't use it that often so I don't keep it plugged in. When I went to use it the battery was dead and it won't recharge. The cost of the battery pack is almost as much as buying a new vacuum.
5,Handy Little Picker Upper,The Eureka 96 B is the greatest little vacuum cleaner. It is so handy to have around for those quick pick-ups that always seem to need our attention and it is so easy to use. We recommend it to everyone as a essential to have in your home.
4,Easy cleanup,"I tried many different cordless stick vacuum's and this one is the best. My Hoover is just too heavy to lug up/down stairs. This little one lives right in the kitchen, where I need it most."
4,A WONDERFUL LITTLE SERVENT,I OWN THIS VACUUM AND AGREE THAT IT IS A WONDERFUL LITTLE SERVENT. THE BATTERY STAYS CHARGED A LONG TIME AND IT REALLY DOES PICK UP THE FUZZ. LIGHTWEIGHT AND HANDY!
1,No suction power for this cordless,"After reading the many positive reviews, I ordered this to replace my Dustbuster that recently died. Unfortunately, the Eureka flunked miserably on my first use due to its low level of suction. A chore of mine is picking up sattered (dry) catfood kibble from the hardwood floors and all this machine does is spread it around. Dust and lint appear to get vacuumed, but anything larger than a grain of cat litter is too much for it to handle. Since I waited too long to return it I'm back here to buy another Dustbuster which is cheaper and much more effective. The only thing positive I could offer is the long running time on a single battery charge. I'd gladly cut that in half to get more suction... it's a great design, but worthless for me."
4,Great for Cat Hair,"I bought this product a few years ago to get cat hair off of my velvet sofa. I use it to vacuum my sofa every day or every other day. It's so much more convenient than hauling out my big vacuum. It's suction isn't as great as a plug in vacuum, but it does a great job on my sofa. After a couple of years of use, the battery is not charging. I just ordered a new battery from Eureka (about $16). I do wish the filter cup was easier to get fully empty, but all together, I've been pretty happy with it"
4,Boss 96D Cordless Upright Vacuum,"I have an expensive Orek corded upright. This isn't nearly as powerful, but makes up in lightness and convenience, and is the one I use daily. Works well on tile or wood, and pretty well on carpet too. Unfortunately batteries last only about a year, and its not much more to get a new vac then a new battery. I've had these for years, they're not for heavy duty work but well worth the reasonable cost."
2,Do not last,Worked fine for a few months. The suction power began to fail until after a short time it would not pick up anything but lint. Would not buy another.
5,Terrific - especially for dog hair,"We've had this two years. Our 2 golden retrievers live in a tiled area of our home and we use this for quick dog hair pick ups. I'm always surprised by the amount of hair that is in the cup, though it's not the biggest receptical out there. It does a decent job of picking up dog hair off the sofa and since the brushes are fairly gentle I keep them on and it helps pull the hair of the surface. Some have said that after a while the vac stopped working. I use an old tooth brush to clean the dust out of the filter each time I empty it. I think as long as you keep the filter clean, it will continue to give you excellent service. When this one goes, I'll replace it immediately."
4,Quick Pickup,"For a quick pickup to ""touch up"" an area without the regular vacuum, this does a very nice job. The only disadvantage is that the battery only last for about 15 minutes, therefore, it's a good thing that it comes with two batteries."
3,Handy,"Handy little device to have near kitchenNot very robust, but price matches qualityDoes what it's supposed to do"
2,Did not live up to other reviews.,"I bought this as a result of previous reviewers who thought this was a great cleaner. Yes, it is light. However, it doesn't pick up dust that has been on the floor for a couple of weeks. It moves pieces of paper, but doesn't pick it up. I am using it in the classroom where dust is a common problem. This isn't the solution."
4,It works!,"This is a great cordless vac. It picks up dog hair, grass, dog hair, lint, dog hair, crumbs, dog hair......get my drift. No more swiffer for me. It's quick and easy. Very lightweight and yet powerful enough to touch up a carpet. I use it on ceramic tile floors and it works very well."
1,Buyers Remorse ...,I bought as a quick way to vacuum my mud room. Unfortunately it was unable to handle the smallest amounts of sand that needed picking up and instead they simply got stuck within the vacuum's wheels and scratched my floor.
1,Your basic piece of junk,Didn't even last for 6 months of light occasional use before it self-destructed - if you're considereing buying this you might as well just throw your money in the trash and save a step.
1,Hard to get replacement parts ...,"Good luck if you ever need replacement parts for Eureka Cordless Quick-Ups! They are constantly changing the ""Model numbers"" on these (96, 96D, 96F, 96DZ ...) and if you lose a filter cage from one it is difficult (so far impossible) to replace & you have to trash the entire vacuum. I was able to transfer the battery pack from one to another.I would NEVER purchase this again!"
4,A very nice little vacuum,"I'm in love with this handy little machine! Would like to give it 4 1/2 stars (not 5 since it could stand a couple of tweaks). The battery lasts about 40 minutes & it's most convenient that a second battery is included with your purchase. It's very lightweight & picks up pet hair quite well. Cons: You have to empty the dirt cup often as it doesn't hold much. Be sure to empty it over a trash can, or even outside as it kicks-up a lot of dust. I have a hard time fitting the dirt cup back on the machine, as the gasket has to be placed just so. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. I was looking for a cordless vac that has the power of an electric - this fills the bill nicely."
4,Eureka 96B a Good Buy,"I am overrall pleased with the purchase. The unit is not too noisy, the suction is good and I like the rotary brush that can be activated for carpeting. After each vacuuming, I'm surprised at how much it picks up....we have 3 cats. My only suggestion for new buyers is for them to purchase a second battery...the original one lasts about 20 minutes or so and I don't charge it until it's fully drained due to the memory retention effect of Nickel Cadmium batteries."
4,Spectacular,"This vacuum is great. I use it because of my hand problems and it is amazing. It is so light weight and it is terrific. It has great suction and is so easy to use. It really is a dream. I could not be happier. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is hard to get into corners or edges, but otherwise it is phenominal. Really a great buy!!"
3,Worked until it broke,"Worked well until it broke after just 5 months of use. I'll replace it with a different, not so cheap brand"
5,Perfect for small cleanup jobs,I have a toddler and a 1 year old. This vac is perfect for picking up crumbs. I use it all over the house.
2,where is it?,"i don't yet know if this charger will fit, as i have yet to receive it. it's always a toss up when one needs a new charger for an old phone. even if the model numbers match, the plug may not fit properly. the phone manufacturer does not keep stock in old parts, so as to encourage the purchase new a new phone. that said, this is a generous 2 stars, as i have no idea when i will receive this order. here's the deal............if someone goes to the trouble to research and order a charger for an older phone, i would think that implies that they NEED IT NOW! $1.27 order with a ship cost of $5.96 for less than one oz. weight.......suggests that this could have been sent faster than the suggested 7-10 days for snail mail from coast to coast."
5,Mandatory reading!,"I have to admit, I saw the film before reading the book, and I recommend them both. In today's climate in America, - when the police profession is considered one of the noblest by liberals and conservatives alike, and the so-called ""liberal"" press, which crossed the line into tabloid journalism awhile ago, and which still hides behind the myth/lie of ""objectivity,"" - this book is as timely and relevant today as it ever was, and should be mandatory viewing/reading."
5,Another Great Lain Trip,"Serial Experiments Lain never ceases to both amaze me and make me think. I love anime that does that. It tops Evangelion, which I thought, for a while, impossible. But beware, those of you who are otaku just looking for cute girls in sailor suits. This anime is intelligent and addictive."
5,Still A Very Good Continuation Of The Story,"First of all, to those people who give poor rating on this episode, I just want to say something. How can you assume that the story is not good if you start watching the second Disc. My suggestion for you is to get the first disc before commenting on the show.Now, to my review of the story, I still give this disc a 5 star rating because even though the plot has thickened, there are still some unanswered questions, and better still, there were new confusion added (like what happened to her sis?, Was Lain on the wired or was she in wherever she was?, etc).They began to tell us who or what is ""Knight"", what they do and what is their plan. Overall, I still think it's a very good disc. I didn't, I don't and I won't regret owning this DVD."
5,Diving deeper,"In this second volume Lain becomes aware of the strange reality of the wired network, which seems to have an existence on its own. As soon as some questions from the first volume are answered, others rise, as we get inside Lain's double life in the real and wired worlds. At the end, you will be longing for the third volume."
4,4 Stars,"Very good and very deep.I watched it dub and have no complaints, but there's the option to watch it sub and a few extras, mostly conceptual drawings and a comercial for the playstation game Lain. There are no commentaries and no offical trailer. Scenes are spaced nicely with 8 scenes per episode. Each episode contains a device (short clip of a body part) and they are all included."
2,"Ponderous, limited and confusing anime ...","This series, about a girl on the 'wired' (internet of sorts) finding intrigue and danger, is far from intriguing or dangerous. The animation is minimal and choice of shots inadequate to maximize storytelling without animation. Perhaps one of the greatest problems is the limited story carries on for far too many episodes. The coloring is too bright too often which makes the different animation levels pop out against each other in an awkward way. All the drawings are crisp and well constructed, and the designs are decently pleasing. For this price, I wouldn't recommend 'Lain'...perhaps if twice as many episodes were per DVD it would be a favorable purchase. The DVD edition is acceptable, but, as with some translated versions using no english speaking natives, there are some embarrasing grammar errors on the packaging."
2,Good program but horrible documentation,"The program works, but the documentation and support is horrible. Had I not worked with this product before I never would have been able to successfully install it. The installation instructions took up 1/2 a page in the manual and needed to be several pages long. Items such as device configuration, security on the Arcserve share and other items required to run the product were omitted. If you are a first time user, this is not for you! And don't even think of calling support unless you have a few hours to kill and like making long distance toll calls."
3,PIAA Extreme White bulbs,"I had high hopes for these bulbs, but upon installation noticed that the ""low"" filament was EXTREMELY DIM. I bought a really cheap pair of the same lights a while back, and they were identical in brightness. Great for the 7440 application, but if you use them with parking lights prepare to look at dim lights..."
1,Mislead,"I was very excited to upgrade my OEM brake/parking in my vehicle. After changing one bulb at a time and viewing the image on my white garage door, I determined that I was mislead with this purchase. Sure, this bulb has more wattage than the OEM (5/21 Watt) with the PIAA at (8/27 Watt). The bulb is covered deeply with blue paint and although it illuminates a whiter color, is is not as bright as the OEM bulb, thus a waste of money.I would not recommend this product."
5,someone please reissue the King World Music Series!!!,"if you can get it, this is a gem. sadly, hard to find. but an absolutely incredible, mind-opening disc."
5,Great Book,"Used this book for sailboat trip in Sea of Cortez. A bit dated, but very informative and worthwhile."
5,Very good watch for the true horror hounds!,"One star?!! Obviously, somebody doesn't appreciate low budget horror! New Year's Evil is one of the better ""slasher"" films of the 80s, in my opinion. I'm sure many would disagree with me, but N.Y.E. is way more interesting than the extremely overrated Friday The 13th Pt. 1, a movie so boring that I've only watched it once. I just saw N.Y.E. last week and I've already watched it twice, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make my friends watch it on New Year's Eve too! N.Y.E. isn't overly gory and it's easy to figure out who the killer is, but this movie has that charm that only 70s and 80s low budget horror films can contain. If you love ignored horror gems like Sleepaway Camp, Night Of The Creep or Rock 'N Roll Nightmare then definitely give New Year's Evil a view."
5,Quick,Highly recommend. Shipper was very fast. What can one say about a 80's Horror flick. Recommend shipper for speed and packaging.
1,waste of money,"I would not recommend this book as a resource to prepare for the CST...It definately had MANY errors and also poor organization of material. There was not one graph, chart, timeline or graphic organizer to enhance presentation of material. I also found that the material presented in the book was not true to the material covered on the actual test. A friend had used an online resource and her materials were much more accurate of determining test material."
3,For Newcomers Only,This books covers 40 years of Doctor Who but barely scratches the surface. There are however lots of nice pictures and this makes a good coffee table book for people wishing to dip in and out of the mythos. Old hands though will find nothing new.
5,Great Book,I love this book. It has some really good information in it about all the doctors up until the 9th one and their companions. I think it is one of the best and coolest books available to all Doctor Who fans.
3,"Works well if you put in the time, devours batteries","I've likely put in no less than 100 hours configuring this remote using the PC software, and this is after I reused artwork and icons from many others who share on remote central. The result is a an attractive and easy to use display which can drive everything in my home entertainment system. Unfortunately, even with all the effort babysitters may still struggle to make everything work right. This remote and its software provides you great flexibility, but you have to really put the time in (on the order of weeks and months)to set everything up nicely. I rather enjoy doing all that, but I believe most people will not.The greatest drawback with this device though is the battery life. I went through a set of 4 AAAs every few days. I therefore went to rechargables which I have to recharge every 2 days. I want to recommend this remote, but given the difficulty many will find in programming it and the battery life I have to stop short."
4,How-to guide for educators in applying for grants,"Browning gained her lengthy experience in grant-writing mostly in the field of education aiding school systems to obtain grants for various purposes. The three preliminary questions one has to ask before pursuing specific grants are where is the money? what format does the funding agency require for applying for a grant? and thirdly, just what has to be written to attract serious interest and give one a good chance of getting the grant? Then Browning elaborates on these basics in a user-friendly style advising grant applicants how to follow through on the process of identifying, assessing, and applying for the particular grant. A to-the-point handbook worth the attention of anyone involved in the competitive task of seeking a grant."
4,Great resource for teachers.,This revision toolbox is a great source to show the differences between editing and revising. The book offers strategies and suggestions that are easy to implement in the class.
4,I found it very useful with practical recipies.,I found it very useful with practical recipies. I needed to find a reliable and economical source for dog treats.
2,I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone.,"This is not a book about making your own dog treats, it's a cookbook for people who treat their dog like a human and have too much time on their hands. If you want to serve your dog pizza, muffins, pasta and fries then this book is right for you.What is ""all-natural"" about the recipes is far from me: They involve a lot of white flour, vegetable shortening, bacon, cheese, cream cheese and so on - not anything that is very healthy for humans, surely not ""natural"" for dogs either.I am very disappointed about this book, especially as it got so many good ratings. My advice: Take the look inside (which I did not do) Very disappointing."
3,3 Dog Bakery,"I only use a couple of recipes out of this book, most of them are more complex than what I was looking for."
5,Gift for dog lover,My oldest niece has a dog named Hartley that pretty much goes everywhere with her so this was Hartley's Christmas present last year and my niece was very excited to receive it.
4,For the ambitious treater,"From quick and easy to pretty elaborate, this is a good book. My dog wants me to use it more!"
1,Book has recipes containing raisins,"It's pretty elementary knowledge that raisins are bad for dogs. This book advocates adding raisins to several of the recipes. Can't the writers do a little research first before endangering dogs like this? I bought this book through Amazon, so it was too late after I discovered this huge faux pas."
4,best dog cook book around,"I am not the type to cook my dog food every day, however it is fun to occasionally spoil this member of the family (as one does the children or the husband). So whilst for treats and the like I think this is an excellent book and very recommendable, expectations should be realistic."
2,Lots of share-your-dinner recipes,"This book has many recipes that I can't ever see using. Many are meals to share with your dog. I'm uncomfortable with that.The cookie recipes are OK, but not terrific, like I'd expected."
3,Many receipes are not for gift giving.,I was looking for a few good recipes for doggie treat gift bags. I found that many of the recipes had treats that needed to be refrigerated which would not work for a treat bag. I didn't even end up trying to make any.
1,Raisins and Walnuts are toxic to dogs,Watch out for the recipes that include quite a large amount of walnuts and raisins. These are toxic to dogs!!!!
4,3 Dog Bakery Cookbook,"I like the 3 Dog Bakery cookbook -- lots of recipes. Best of all, my dogs like them!"
2,Don't use raisins,"Some of the recipes are easy biscuits which Droopy likes. Many are meals like pasta, etc. It's an interesting book but it gets major negative doggie points for including recipes with raisins -- grapes are toxic to dogs.I am also not sure I trust other aspects of their recipe development. I made pineapple cookies which Droopy did enjoy eating, but I tried giving him a plain pineapple and he would not touch it -- does this mean I'm buying a can of pineapple for the recipe just because it makes it seem more tasty to the humans making it?Some are also no brainers, e.g., turkey burgers. Well yes, dogs are going to like eating turkey burgers but they also like the hamburger sitting on your plate, too, and I didn't need to buy a dog cookbook for that.That said, the recipes I've tried so far have impressed Droopy's pals, so that's why I'm not giving this a rock bottom rating."
5,Jeb and Jake,Three Dog Bakery Cookbook arrived in great condition and was as advertised. We have enjoyedreading it and trying the receipes. Delivery was fast. A great place to order.
5,Great Recipes,I haven't made any of the recipes yet but have read them all. The ingredients are all readily available in the grocery store and the treats look fairly easy to make. I have always been a fan of the bakery and have ordered on-line and visited the stores when I travel. I especially like that there are recipes for softer treats for my 17-year old pooch.
4,Tastey Dog Treats,"I have an aged pet that has cancer. I bought this book to make homemade treats for her in an effort to help her overall health. I found the recipes to be easy to make and found most all the ingredients at my local grocery story. She loved the treats and ate them up fast.If you are a pet owner that is concerned about the type of products used in petfood and pet treats and want to do something about it, this is the book for you."
4,One important problem,"I think a lot of the recipes in this book are great, as do my dogs. But there is one very important problem with this book. There are some ingredients that dogs should not ingest, and some of those are included in these recipes! Raisins being one of them. :("
4,"Good album, but there are better.","This is a good album, and it's worth buying, but it's not some of his best tracks. MacArthur Park and L-Dopa are the best on this album. If you're a longtime Maynards fan, it's worth checking this out."
5,Great Book for Arabic Language Newbies,"Sa'id Nicola was my Arabic teacher many years ago. He used us (his students) as guinea pigs when writing this book to see how well beginning Arabic students could understand the language. We looked forward to the days when he would bring in his latest adapted pages for us to read. They were a welcome break from some of the repetitive drills that were the language teaching staple of the time.The stories are great and the vocabulary builds on itself from story to story. Best of all, the glossary features the terms as they are presented in the text. You don't have to find the three letter root in Arabic!If you are learning Arabic and want to be able to read some enjoyable material with a great glossary, this is the book for you."
3,Good but..............hard to get use to,"I have vegas 4 and i gotta tell ya the things anoyin to get use to and how to know how to use stuf on this thing.This vegas is so complicated that you cant even find the dam button to split the video in half it took me about 7 days just to find it.Well heres my final review on the item.The good:1.Good editing,and alot of files to save as when your done like mpeg 1,mpeg 2 etc.)2.I liked the fact how you can have text fly on screen with different text styles and different transtions.3.Alot of transtions to choose from you can have 35 switchs and fade black out and stuff like that.4.You can make atleast 7 little videos on one screen at once!The bad:1.It takes about a week to get use to to know how to use it.2.Im not shure but when you have text on the video it has to fade all the time.3.Takes a long long time to save a movie,like i made a video that was 3 mintues it took like 35 mintues.Well thats what i think of vegas 4 Peace out!!!!"
5,Excellence prose,"Even if you aren't a Civil War buff, this is a book to read. Excellently written - almost every sentence is artful crafted. If you are a buff, I believe this will be as close as you can come to actually being there. I have frequently reread The Black Flower."
4,Very Fine Work,"Pathos is the key ingredient here, but there is much, much more. The book conveys some truly marvelous images and personalities that are essentially and profoundly ""southern"". The only real flaw may be that, in order to truly appreciate this book, one may have to have been raised in the deep south. I found this to be a surprisingly fine book. I hope that Mr. Bahr will favor us with many more."
3,"""The Black Flower"" - Not A Classic, But.....","A wonderful story filled with mystery and intrigue during one of the most horrific battles of the American Civil War. Howard Bahr brings home the state of the Confederacy at its twilight through his main characters.Alhtough I recommend this book to Civil War fans, I find that Mr. Bahr trails off at times. For instance, there is a small section where a wasp is crawling on the body of the wounded Bushrod Carter. Mr. Bahr actually has the wasp describe it's journey along Carter's body. This part was a little much for me.Far from a classic, The Black Flower was still an enjoyable book. The sufferings from 3 1/2 years of battles, marching and starvation are evident in the struggle of the Confederacy's independence."
4,Realistic and Romantic,"I think this was what it was really like...three likable sorts hanging out together and also fighting in a war. What I liked most about THE BLACK FLOWER was the stark realism, the comradarie, and the feeling that you were really there. The men and boys who fought in the civil war are so accurately portrayed. You have a feeling of trully trancending time. I enjoyed this book even more than THE KILLER ANGELS because the focus was on human weakness and strength rather than military maneuvers.I got bogged down a bit in the boy-girl scenario, like it was added just to placate the readers who love romance. Either Anna should have known Bushrod a little longer or not have gotten so involved. The 24 hour romance was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. But I am anxious to get a hold of the authors JUBILO tale."
5,Black Flower blows Cold Mountain away!,"As a civil war buff and native of Tennessee I am always looking for works that take us beyond the dates, times, and statistics of most books on military history. This book was one of those books for me. In addition to getting you literally inside the head of the main characters, Howard Bahr takes you on amazing side trips, such as the incredible description of a wasp crawling up a man's pants leg. Compared to this riveting work, Cold Mountain is amateurish."
3,Mixed Feelings on this book.,"Some parts of the book the dialog is brilliant, but in other parts the author seems to get side track into other things. For instance, in one part of the book the author uses 2 1/2 pages to discribe the journey of a wasp crawling up a wounded soldier's body. Whats that about? It didn't seem much to have to do with anything relevant to the story. The book reminds me of an impressionist painting. The picture (story) is unclear but youcan basically understand it. Not really my style."
3,doctorgraz,"Not bad, but not the greatest novel I've read. Maybe I could exchange it for another book.............right."
3,Good Civil War Story,"I love anything about the Civil War..and this was a good story, but didn't quite grab me like others have. Can't quite put my finger on it, but I sometimes found myself getting a little antsy...and wanting to get on with it. I wanted to love this like so many other reviewers did, but it was an enjoyable read nonetheless."
4,Different than most,"The views of the civil war in this book are mostly internal and come from the meandering thoughts of the characters themselves. That does not make this a terrible read, just not quite what I was expecting. I have always been fascinated with books on this subject and this era in general, and although I found the writing in this book to be very original and interesting, there were times where I also found it confusing. There is some jumping from past to present and back to the past without much warning and that got a little confusing and made me pull away from the story a bit. What I did like about this book was the painstaking effort the author put into his descriptions. If anyone ever wondered what it was like to be one of the men fighting these battles, this book can nearly put you there. Overall I can recommend this book, but I do wish to warn people that there are some graphic portions and foul language, which add to the ambiance, but also may offend some. Pretty impressive."
5,Working great!,Slippers work great. Ordered a pair for my 5-yr old. I ordered one size larger than her regular shoe size which I had seen recommended somewhere. They fit only slightly large but are working great for her.
2,Dissapointed,Pros:-Hood looks good.-Filter system is very good and gives great surface agitation.-Really like the panel access from the top.-Great cord organization for clean install.Cons:-Plastic used is a little bit flimsy considering you just dropped $100 for a plastic box that has a reg filter and T-8 lights.-The lights on this thing are ABSOLUTE JUNK they worked barely a week and they start flickering and it was a chore to keep having to twist and mess with them. I finally gave up and retrofit some LED lights and took out the T-8 fixture.If the light fixture was better then I would have given this four stars. To get five they would have needed to use a lot better plastic OR make this $75
4,Eclipse 2 Hood,"Hood matched the original Aquarium Package purchased years ago. It is compact, it works well and it is easy to maintain."
4,Not bad.,"A sleek, fitted, and alltogether nice looking unit. The filter works surprisingly well to keep acceptable water quality and clarity. Lighting is NOT adequate for live plants.In short, if you keep fish only, and reasonable to light stocking levels, and want a super clean, neat, and very, very convenient setup, this is for you!I had one that ran for years, until the ballast went out. At the time I couldn't find replacement parts, so had to scrap the whole thing. That's ok, I desperately needed better lighting anyway."
5,First-Rate Book for Beginners,"I purchased the Nikon D-70 book from this author and this D-50 guide at the same time, this one for my wife and the D-70 book for myself. You don't really need both, as the two cameras are very similar and the pair of books covers much common ground. However, we're glad to each have a copy for our respective cameras.It really is a first-rate book for beginners who need some help in learning how to use their Nikon digital SLR."
2,Glorified Manual,"This book adds very little to Nikon's user manual--it's simply better written. So, if you're looking for expert advice on how/why/when to use the camera's more advanced features, you're going to be disappointed. There's simply very little ""value-add."" In fact, only the first 1/3 of the book pertains to the D50; the remainder contains generic information on picture taking and digital manipulation."
5,Must buy for D50 owners,"I'm one of those who puzzled over the Nikon manual furnished with the D50, and was less than thrilled over other books that purport to teach you how to use this camera. Those other books are just re-hashes of the camera manual and teach you very little about photography. This one is different. The author does not try to entirely supplant the user manual, but instead helps you understand the most important tools, controls, and options. Most of the book is devoted to showing you how to take wonderful pictures with the Nikon D50. I loved the 100 page chapter on various shooting situations with lots of information on recommended lenses, settings, setups and so forth. This book is fantastic for the new owner of a D50."
4,Great book!,"This book is a big help for the beginner to digital photography, with very easy to understand illustrations and tips. It is a good tool to keep close to your camera bag for quick and easy reference."
5,A color manual and more,"I recommend this book to those who felt the manual that came with the camera was not enough. It covers everything that is in the manual with more detail and every page is in color as well. Along with the information on how to use the camera, it also gives you simple and basic information on how to take pictures explaining exposure, metering and more. Nice book to have around for beginners."
2,"Adequate, but not great","This is an OK addition to the manual, but it seems that the author simply took his D70 field guide book and performed a search & replace D70 -> D50. At times, it's really embarassing and one wonders whether there was any kind of proof reading. As an example, the book shows a picture of the 18-70 mm ""kit"" lens of the D70, but with the caption claiming this to be the 18-55 mm D50 ""kit"" lens. The author also talks about features that the D50 simply doesn't have, such as the field-of-depth preview button, the metering mode button, etc. The book doesn't go beyond the manual at any time. One could have wished for a more rigorous treatment of subjects such as f-stops. After reading the book, I don't feel that I learned anything new about photography in general, or the Nikon D50 in particular. At least I didn't spend a lot of money on this picture book;-)"
4,Keep the Manual but Buy This Book Too!,"The D50 was my third DSLR after two Canons...a 10D and a 300D. I got this Nikon D50 and immediately liked it better than the Canons. So much so that I've already upgraded to a D70s, sold it and upgraded again to the D80. Now I'm looking for a good deal on the D300.But, back to the D50 Field manual (which I sold with the D50). Good book, clear text and nice slick pages and color photos. Sure it talks a lot to generic DSLR photography but it also addresses specific functions of the D50 in great detail. Did I like it ...yeah! How much? Well...I'm waiting for my D80 Field manual to arrive and if I ever get the D300, well I'll probably get a Field manual for it too!! This is a Good Buy!!!"
2,Owners manual in large print.,"The book is two books in one: a rehash of the owners manual, but with some errors (like referring the reader to the non-existant metering mode button); and a tutorial on basic photography.If you already know what depth-of-field is and how to compose a shot, and if you still have your owners manual from the D50, save your money and skip this book."
4,Did the job,"Is this THE perfect book to learn the operation of the D50? Probably not, but for me, it did the job. I had a limited amount of time after purchasing the D50, to learn it's operation before my sister's wedding. After looking through the owner's guide that came with the camera, I knew that wasn't the tool to do the job. This ""field manual"" had me up to speedin no time. Yes, about half the book is devoted to basic photography thatapplies to any SLR, but the meat of the book is THE tool to quick masteryof D50 operation."
4,Nikon D50 Field Guide,"Why do manufacturers of such splendid kit as the D50 supply such impenetrable manuals? It wasn't until I bought the D50 Field Guide that I was able to fathom and use many useful features. Excellent and heartily recommended. A bit big for my back pocket, but you can't have everything!"
5,Great addition!,"I actually received this book before I received my new Nikon D50. It was and continues to be a great asset. The learning curve on any new digital can be steep, but this book helps to make sense of all the features of the camera. Topics are easy to find, and just as easy to understand. I would recommend this to anyone who purchases this wonderful camera."
5,Great book for new D50 Owners,"I know it's intimidating to buy and use your first DSLR, but the Nikon D50 makes a great choice. This book is a great choice for information when you're ready to really learn how to use your D50 to take better photographs. Advice to ""read the manual"" is not useful when the manual is obtuse and contains countless cross-references. This book has it all, laid out for you in an easy to access manner.It has lots of full color pictures of the camera and its controls and then later many color photos showing the techniques of photography and composition, categorized by type of photography. This book is compact enough to carry along with you, and belongs in every photographer's bag when out in the field."
5,Much needed labor history,"The labor movement today encounters calls for patriotic sacrifice as well as threats of employer bankruptcy and government attack. We need to be educated on these issues. For example, the Railway Labor Act has recently been used to deny airline workers the right to strike. This book by Dick Roberts tells you how this package of laws was first used against labor in the 1920s, to satisfy the needs of big business. Roberts tells the story of the rail barons' greed and the bailouts they got from bought-and-paid-for politicians. He also tells the story of the great struggles by rail workers. Throughout, the government has backed the railroad companies and called on rail workers to sacrifice in the name of patriotism, just as airline workers are today being pressured in the name of Homeland Security to abandon their right to strike and continue down the slippery slope of take-backs."
5,"Creative, intelligent and odd","Imagine if Sonic Youth had jazz chops and ditched the singing and you'd have an approximation of Nels Cline's Destroy All cd. It's wonderfully inventive guitar based jazz(?) both free and the more tonally conventional kind mixed with rock propulsive muscle and an avant-gardist's love of noise and texture. Destroy All is adventurous and creative music that defies easy categorization but is rewarding for those willing to take the ride. It's some of the most unique and interesting, yet accessable improvised music I've heard in a while. They buzz, howl and generate a lot of heat."
2,Beware of sizing!,"My wife is a 7/8. She bought a 9/10 to be safe, but when she got them, I don't know if a 13/14 would have fit. Perhaps she got a mis-sized item, but be cautious..."
3,Runs Extremely Small,"I purchased these capris for a client and they run extremely small!! They are very good quality pants aside from that, and they look fabulous with appliqued patches on them."
4,CUTE CAMO CAPRI!,"These are very nice CAPRI pants. I paired mine up with some cute wedge heels.. def a GO! FYI I wear size 8.. I purchased a size 13 ,do to the other reviews and I am glad I did , because the cut is small on this style camo capri so please go up at least 2 sizes if not 3."
5,Does the Job,"There's not much to say about such a simple product. It conducts electricity, fits my wrist, and is more than sturdy enough for my occasional use. No complaints."
3,Prevented Cancer,"I was out one day riding my bike and someone told me I was in a high cancer area. I grabbed this puppy out of my fanny pack and strapped in. I managed to ride my bike safely through the cancerous region. This was confirmed but several doctors. Thank you jesus for medicaid. If I didn't have that I couldn't have had $500,000 in cancer tests done.I docked two stars though because it didn't prevent my friend from getting HIV."
3,Not quite orange,"I purchased these earrings for two reasons; I have a few which are similar with different colored briolettes and I liked the style of those earrings, and I had no padparadscha stones and I wanted that lovely orange color for some jewelry. While the earrings themselves didn't disappoint, the stones were not quite orange. Well, actually they were not at all orange, but were more of a pale pink. The color ""orange"" could in no way be used to describe the earrings. They did come in a pretty little box ""present"" box, which I liked. I kept the earrings because I like this particular earring style and didn't have any of the pale pink color that these earrings were. Maybe it is the luck of the draw, but I still wouldn't place another order for these with a padparadscha briolette."
5,Just as described: kid fun,"Enough to engage a kid for a few minutes, but not much longer.... though sometimes a few minutes is all you need, and for that, these work great."
3,"Low-priced magnets, but expensive shipping!","Do not select the ""recommended"" purchase of three sets of magnets. They are all three the same; a pair of buzz magnets in three packages. It's misleading to think you will be getting a variety of magnets. The shipping cost more than the three pairs of magnets."
2,Overpriced!,"While the product was shipped in a timely fashion, and in good condition as promised, it was (almost) drastically overpriced.""My bad,"" as the saying goes for not looking harder."
4,"You have to learn to walk before you learn to run, Excellent","Learn VB 6 in TEN MINUTES, I thought... you gotta be kidding, I must admit though, I was surprised. This was the best ten minutes I ever spent. I'm the sort of chap who would rather spend ten minutes on a quick ""how to"" book rather than wade through 40,000 pages of online help and believe me, this book helps you do just that. It is well presented, easy paced and although the ""ten minutes"" in the title is stretching it a bit (200+ pages), it starts off easy and slowly builds to describe some fairly imtimidating stuff in a way that even I could understand. I certainly recommended this title, I know I will have it by my computer as I am wading my way through pages of code."
1,good reviews fooled me into buying this book,"How can anybody (two people before me) write a good review for this book is beyond me. I have two VB 5 books, and thought this one would quickly bring me up to speed with VB 6.Instead, it made me feel stupid at first, and angry later. Poorly written, infested with errors, illustrations don't match the text. I struggled through page 30 and abandoned it in utter frustration. Will request a full refund from Amazon."
2,Not worth the read. Big letdown.,"The story starts off well enough with good strong characters--an ideal hero material and a tough yet vulnerable lady. Everything is moving nicely along until they get married. Once this happens, it's like both of their brains just shut down! Both of them easily get mad at the other's teasing comments until they can't even communicate with each other anymore. The villen wasn't what I expected either--a wus. This is the first book I've read by Ms. Dier and I shudder to try another!"
3,An Well Written Unoriginal Plot,"Here's the plot: Hero's family killed and he goes on a man-hunt for the perp(s). He finds a new love and together they are menaced by the baddies. Of course they have to run through various locales, foreign and domestic. Although this novel is well-written, the charaters solid, and the tale holds interest, this author will have to do better plot-wise to become a force in this genre. The one original twist in this book is that it introduces a note of spirituality. I'm still arguing with myself as to whether that added to, or detracted from, the story. Not a great book but a good average ""thriller."""
4,No man's land,"I think this book was a very good book because it had action and some sudden things like, A man getting shot in his bodey.However It whould be good for someone in to the civlwar,or just looking for a book that has a lot of action.The book was diffrent in a way because it showed the suffering that the men whent threw because of hunger."
3,Hey,This book has a lot of action but it's all in the end. It would be a lot better book if it had action during the whole book. It taught you how the war was from the Confederate point of view. This was an ok book.
4,Good book for beginning children's writers,"Tracey Dils takes a complex subject and breaks it down into manageable bites. While she doesn't go into great depth, she covers the chlidren's book market in detail. Her exercises lead writers from the first inklings of ideas to finding a publisher. I'd recommend this as the first book for anyone aspiring to write for children."
5,"Good, solid advice from someone who knows how","Tracey Dils has written a comprehensive, yet accessible book for anyone who's interested in breaking into children's literature. Her examples are clear, to the point, and helpful, and her exercises are dynamite, opening readers up to new ways of thinking about writing for children. She explains the various types of children's books, which helps readers learn how to identify and classify just exactly what publishers mean when they talk about leveled readers, picture books, beginning readers, chapter books, young adult literature, and all the rest. The appendices and resources are excellent, as are her tips on manuscript preparation. I recommend this book without reservation."
4,Concise Helpful Guide for Beginning Children's Writers,"Tracy E. Dils has provided a wonderful handbook for anyone who has ever enjoyed telling children's stories. Using this book will help you put your stories into print and hopefully get them published.She doesn't promise that you will be published, but she sure works hard to get you there from the very start all the way through to breaking into print.Writing a children's book is not as easy as it sounds. Most people are surprised that it is more difficult than one would expect. Dils lays out the guidelines in such a way that you almost cannot fail.Using this guide with the companion workbook will certainly help you on your way to becoming a successful children's author. A friend and I used these two books with good success. Dils got us started and she can do the same for you.You Can Write Children's Books"
3,Good!,"Wish you could make it easier for the beginner. Maybe give websites where you can see examples. For a newbie, seems like a lot to do. Can be confusing."
4,Exceptional!,"For a beginning writer of this type of genre, I found the book informational. It gives different categories for types of children's books and hints on how to write for that particular genre."
4,Love the hat,I was a little worried ordering this since there wasn't a picture of someone actually wearing the hat to get a good feel for the size but I am very happy with the way it fits. I will be using it this summer while gardening.
1,NOT THE SAME ITEM AS PICTURED!,"This was not the item I received from the company. Different colors and make. Besides that it is a SUBPAR release, and much too large for even a big guy like me, 6'1, 200lbs with larger hands. I would only advise you to buy it if you cant afford anything better or if you HAVE HUGE HANDS!! Tsk tsk sportmans guide you let me down on this one."
2,"I like Invader Zim, but...","The latest in a long line of attempts to cash in on the Invader Zim license, it seem like these DVD sets omit many of the great special features included in the initial DVD's that garnered the fan base they have now. Invader Zim is a quirky, dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from Nickelodeon because of shows like Rugrats clogging up the airwaves. Anyone who's wandered into a Hot Topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow Viacom missed out on by cutting this series short. That being said, these DVD's don't do the show justice. Do yourself a favor, and track down the initial three volume DVD release (used) to enjoy all the extras, commentaries, and animatics for episodes that were never completed."
2,"Good Cartoon, Poor Quality Product","The show is great and entertaining.This review is specifically about the poor quality of the actual product received. The DVD's skip, get stuck and pixilate. I'd recomend buying from another source. Maybe other copies were better. Wish we'd found out and returned within the return window but didn't think to try them immediately upon getting them to check for quality. Disappointed. Go find the originals instead or if you don't care about DVD ownership you can watch these episodes on Amazon On Demand for a lot less and hopefully better quality.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOB41C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img < -- :("
5,Review,"Love this but was just disappointed it didnt come when I was told it would come. But other than that, very satisfied."
1,ugh,"Yes I have seen it a few times - more than once. Just because it got cancelled is no excuse for such a poor show. And the characters with their huge ugly eyes look like voodoo dolls. It creeps me out. Thank goodness it got taken off the air. I love Nicktoons though, where did Nicktoons go wrong after Spongebob?"
1,They are NOT serious!,"This was the most demented and disturbing cartoon ever made since Aaah Real Monsters. I mean, seeing a giant ailen zit pop? What is that? I have no idea why people even like this show."
1,"Sick, twisted, violent= not for kids","It's so dark and gloomy, why would anyone want to watch this show? Honestly, I don't think it is sutitble for children."
1,One word,What kind of show is this? This show is the STUPIDEST thing ever. Nicktoons used to have good shows like Hey Arnold. Parents do not let your kids watch this show or they will think every thing is related to aliens and outer space.
5,Gorgeous Panels,"I bought the curtain panels to go with the comforter set in my european inspired guest bedroom and they look great together. At first I thought they might be too short for my high windows but they fit perfectly. They have rod pockets , but I decided to hang them with curtain clips and they look very elegant. I'm very pleased with this purchase"
3,NMH - NO WAY,"I like the cd but definately agree with what he said below""sounding like Neutral Milk Hotel and Bright Eyes, don't be fooled; that couldn't have been more off, especially the NMH part. Nothing about this band resembles arguably the most influential band on indie music.""Not sure how they were compared to NMH either. Someone needs to clean out their ears."
4,3 delights,"The three of my favorite authors give us wonderful stories. Out of the three, however, my favorite would have to be the second with all its delicious intrigue (hidden passages, odd relatives). ""Mistletoe Kisses"" just does not stay put. The other stories are still not to be passed over. Archibald, who thinks he is not worthy and yet gives a mother a most precious gift, and Lady Ann, who refuses to deal with any more gossip, find themselves in interesting and difficult situations. They manage to find the courage to overcome their difficulties with a smile on their face."
1,Good shock's bad amazon purchase,"Amazon clearly states that these shocks are for my land cruiser 1999, when i took it to the mechanic he said yes they are made for this vehicle but for the Gasoline type, I have the diesel engine type, which uses a hydraulic shock that lift's the vehicle at a certain altitude with a touch of a button inside the deck: low,normal and high, so theses shocks are just a waste of my money because of amazon's bad/short filter search, they should clearly put engine type for these cases because these parts are very expensive and to make a mistake is a real killer."
1,No better than canning wax,Basically got ripped off with this product. Received six very small cubes of wax that was no better than bees or canning wax. True jewelers wax has above average adhesion. Its strength makes it possible to use a small inconspicuous amount hold a piece of jewelry or gemstone is a display position. This product certainly does not do that!
5,Not a book on the quotidian.,"This is not to be mistaken for a book on Slimane's collections. It is, rather, a glimpse into what Slimane sees in his own environment. That he can take something as mundane as hotel curtains and Venetian blinds and render them in a seductive and physically palpable manner in a book is a reflection of his talent for design. The glamour of Slimane's collections and his life is captured in the production of the book itself, in the reflective, almost luscious materiality of the mylar pages coupled with the luxurious coloring of the photographs.It is not for every individual, but perhaps those with the vision to ""see."""
1,Horrible,"This CD is horrible. The cheap unbalanced music arrangement and the ear-scratching voices are just insane. I realize this CD is for babies, but man, they have ears too. Why torture them?"
4,"Filter shape is not hexagonal, but round, which is accurate","Just mentioning that I uploaded a picture showing the actual shape of the filter I received, which differs from the shape shown in the default product image. The filter is actually round, which matches the shape of the original filter that came with this humidifier. I don't know if the hexagonal filter currently shown for this product will fit in this unit, but I have my doubts considering the filter on this model is designed to fit inside the tank and the opening in the tank is also round... but it seems the discrepancy might be moot if all others who purchased this filter also received round filters.BTW, I gave it 4 of 5 stars only because, although I feel the humidifier works as I expect it to, I feel it's over-priced and I'd much prefer that the filter be redesigned to reduce waste, perhaps by making the plastic casing reusable."
2,Fits,"This fits mySPT SU-4010 Ultrasonic Dual-Mist Warm/Cool Humidifier with Ion Exchange Filteras it supposed to, but lasts for only a couple weeks. Maybe this is all that is to be expected with Chicago water, but I'm constantly cleaning slime and deposits from the inside of the humidifier base and mist path, sometimes only a week after replacing with a new filter... However, I don't know of any alternative in terms of an ion exchange filter replacement."
2,Too expensive!,"This is just a replacement filter for my humidifier, I am giving it a 2 star rating just because it seems to expensive, it costs almost half of what a brand new humidifier (including a filter) costs. It seems to be the same with any brand of humidifiers thou!"
5,great replacement,This replacement filter is identical to the one included with the humidifier and works just as good as the original.
4,SPT ION F-4010 Replacement Filter,"Okay, it's a replacement filter. I guess it works just fine. I will continue to purchase these because I will continue to have a need. No negatives about the product to speak of."
2,Heavy handed,"Barenboim tries to make the sound world of Schumann sound like Bruckner/Wagner. Listen to the wonderful performances of Sawallisch and you will see the difference. The 2nd symphony is dull. Listen to the sublime adagio in the hands of Karajan, it simply soars and then listen to Barenboim. It is a pity that certain critics gush over this."
2,What a waste of an incredible opportunity!,"This book made me very sad. Sad for the author, Julie Hecht, who had the most amazing access to Andy Kaufman for well over a year, at one of the peak times in his life, and did absolutely nothing with it. She didn't understand him, she didn't appreciate him and she certainly didn't think he was very funny. Hecht manages to record a lot of banal conversations with Kaufman - but very little of it is interesting, new or enlightening. The fact that it took her over 20 years to even publish what was supposed to be a short story for a magazine, illustrates how little she understood or appreciated Andy (or Bob Zmuda). Most likely this book was whipped up upon the release and success of Man On The Moon. Ms. Hecht is in dire need of a sense of humor, this book is not worth the time of anyone who already appreciates Andy Kaufman."
1,Waste of A Book,"I bought this book expecting some laughs and insight into Andy Kaufman. What I got was a self-serving book by a very annoying author who basically has nothing worthwhile to say. Andy Kaufman blew the author off for years, presumably because she was (1) annoying and (2) boring. Then, years later after he's dead, she writes a book basically setting herself up as some kind of witty side kick who gave Andy all these wonderful straight lines. No. Actually you bored Andy, were about as much fun as a wet disrag, and will bore anyone foolish enough to but this book. What a wasted opportunity. Hey Andy: you were right in not wasting too much time on the interview."
2,What's really genius,"is how anyone could manage to sell a book that is written so dryly and with so little flare about a man who was all about flare.This book, while it's interesting to read about real Andy experiences, does not do the artist any service. It's text-book dull, though fortunately not nearly as long.I believe this is a valuable book. However, it could have been executed SO much better by the author."
4,Great book!,"I got this as a gift, and I loved it. Even though I like Stegner, this isn't something I would have picked for myself, but the writing and the story had me hooked from early on. I just lent it to a friend, and so far he's giving it two thumbs up as well. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, well-written story - even if history isn't your genre of choice."
5,Entrepreneurial Adventure,"This is not a book for staid historians or energy policy wonks. Wallace Stegner's Discovery! The Search for Arabian Oil is a real life adventure chronicle casting nomads, royalty, entrepreneurs and diplomats against a backdrop of the past century's most significant resource development. And were lucky it's been under wraps until now, when we can use it as a lens with which to view the next big turn in energy."
4,Discovery!: The Search of Arab Oil,"I enjoy very much this book that presents, well documented, all the difficulties and problems faced by the group of geologist and engineers, looking for oil, who did the initial contract, exploration and evaluations in Saudi Arabia, and the efforts and ingenuity used to solve them. An excellent consultation book for earth scientists and studious of the oil industry."
3,Don't Touch Yer Wallet,"This cd is not worth the high asking price. It contains a couple of forgettable rock tunes, and a few new agey instrumentals. There is one great fusion instrumental called Darlene. A better choice would be John Mclaughlin's Electric Dreams featuring Shankar, or Zappa's YCDTOSA Vol.6 which features Shankar on the instrumentals Thirteen, and Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance."
5,Can't Put it Down Good....,Shawn Levy could write about a sack of potatos and make it interesting. I knew very little of Rubi but after reading this book I feel like went through a week by week breifing of the events of his life. Some of the details in the book are of astounding accuracy; I wonder how he did it. Bravo Bravo.
5,The Last Playboy: The High Life of Porfirio Rubirosa,"Well researched account of the life of ""Ruby."" Juicy narrative of the man married to Barbara Duke and Barbara Hutton among others, (at the time considered the wealthiest women in the world), amid the ultra high society lifestyle he pursued while maintaining a ""job"" for the Dominican Republic as a diplomat. Scandalous, sexy, fast paced...you won't want to put this one down."
2,"A little less tabloid writing, please!","The book covers a fascinating subject because Porfirio Rubirosa was among the top playboys of his day. However, the writing style of author Shawn Levy is of the tabloid variety with little to back his ever-present purported subjective hypothesis and lame attempts at humor. A straightforward biography with fleshed-out facts would have been far more appreciated by this reader than the filler that comprised most of the book."
1,Not enough,"An odd CD - much of the art was in Japanese. That's about all I remember of this purchase.Too bad, because I've been told that Bill Clement was a phenomenal piper for dancing. but there wasn't anything interesting on this disk."
2,Review?!!,"I think that the book that I had must have been different from the one the other reviewers purchased, because my ""Appleton & Lange's Practice Test for the USMLE Step 2"" had poorly written questions, with many answers that were out of date and/or incorrect. The questions were nothing like those seen on the Step 2. Questions in the book were generally 2-3 sentences long, where as on the computer based test the most of the questions were paragraphs long. The only redeaming part of the tests were that sets of questions would build on one another, forcing you to take several looks at a question. For instance- based on answer for question 'a' and 'b', what is the answer for question 'c'. This type of questioning, however, is nothing like that found on Step 2. For a quick glance at a penny store, this would be an okay book. For improving test taking skill and knowledge at it's full price tag, this one's a joke. For some much better books look at the ""Crush the Boards"" and ""NMS-tests"""
2,A HOAX,"I'm sure the Author of this book tried to make the maximum effort struggling to make a simulating test just as the USMLE 2 test. I'm sorry folks to tell you that this exam is just for good resource of a bunch of questions and answers but it is far cry from the format of the USMLE real test. The drawbacksthat I found on this test are: most of the questions are short histories WITHOUT complete labs that always come in the usmle based test. I have found some questions in the CD that do not match the answering content in the software, the answers are not 100% updated, the test frame occupy 2/3 of the screen which I found like a bad design of the test, resuming all I can tell that is complete a lie telling that REPLICATE the ctual exam, I think that this author just wanted to be lucrative instead of making a piece of work that resembles the usmle based test, I recommend to try the PrincetonReview is more accurately than this hoax."
5,great series,exactly as advertised and finished the series word word word word word word word word word word word word word
2,Not quite what you expect,"I just got the item in today after waiting almost 2weeks after I purchased it. For the price you pay its not exactly as nice as you expect. For a small jewlery box its poorly finished, on the inside you can see glue all over where they put it together and on the outside there are bubbles from what I can only assume is the nails holding the wood together. The latch on the front doest fit snug at all nor does it line up quite right. Im quite dissapointed I do not suggest this to anyone looking for a small Asian inspired jewlery box or anything of the sort."
2,"Cheap quality, mass-produced, slightly defective.","Not quite those expensive lacquer boxes you might find in import stores and boutiques. The sides seams were splitting and were coming off when it arrived, making it useless as a Christmas present. I am not sure how they're sourcing these, but you get what you pay for in this case."
3,Well made scissors,"These are nicely manufactured scissors. Easily handled and used and very sharp. After a recent back injury, they made the chore or toenail care much easier."
2,unbalanced rotor,"thought this is a quality rotor. After installed on my Sienna van, the car shakes a lot on the highway. Balanced tires twice in 1 month, and still vibrate. Before changing the rotor, car was no such problem. These rotors seem out of balance itself. Bad buy"
2,Nothing Special,"If you want to see Hudson Leick topless, Something About Sex has a better scene for that & it's a decent overall movie though she only has a bit part in it. She has a larger role in this movie but it still doesn't save the movie from mediocrity. Combined with elements of rape & drug use, I just found it hard to enjoy."
1,Does not fit,This refill does not fit the wall mounted piece. It is too large and the front piece cannot close. No instructions included.
1,Grant Seeking in an Electronic Age,"I recommend not purchasing this book. The book (purchased new for over $70 then express shipped for a grant writing course in graduate school) is literally falling apart. The quality is poor. (the publishers should be ashamed). I agree with another reviewer that the charts are poor. I feel sorry for the authors that this book is of such poor quality from the publisher because I liked the smaller chapters which were written in a clear, concise writing style. However,this book is not for an advanced researcher or writer . . . more tailored to freshmen level."
2,Horrible layout,"Although the book has useful information, I returned it due to the horrible layout. The graphs, charts, and other illustrations look like they are from a xerox in the 90s. For the price, I expect more quality."
4,From Underground to Mainstream,"I heard a few demos from the band here and there and if you are into Korn, Orgy, Deadsy or other bands like it, PMM is probably for you. It's a new breath in music today where a lot of bands are out there performing music only to make themselves look good and do it for the money. PMM is in it for the music. I heard of Tom Logan and Left-Hand Grahm through Michale Graves band/CD Web of Dharma (sorry....it's not available through stores and it is hard to find online but if you find it,...get it....and yes Michale Graves was the same guy from the Misfits) and these two guys are great players. The vocals are dark, gothic and totally cool."
3,I changed my mind,"Well, after listening to the cd a few more times, I noticed that the reason the songs stuck in my head was because they are all fairly similar to each other. I guess I jumped the gun with my initial review of this albulm. I changed my opinion a little, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's not a decent cd. I think it was worth the ten bucks I paid for it. Listen to one of their songs and if you like it, get the cd 'cause they're all alike (kinda.) Another cd I recently bought was Dog Fashion Disco, which is really good if you're a System of a Down fan. It sounds like a cross of them and a little Marilyn Manson with the singing."
2,Disappointing,I bought this cd based on a positive review of the band in METAL EDGE magazine and they've toured with a few bands that I like - but it's a big disappointment. It's hard to distinguish one song from the next because they all sound the same. The singer's voice never changes as he moans from one song to the next. The guitars are simple and boring and the overall production of the cd is poor.
2,Not really worth it...,"First off, I am not a big PMM fan. I heard their song on the End of Days Sound Track and thought it was pretty good. That song is on this CD, but as a ... with shittier production. This might be a CD a NIN fan might like, but I (as a devout follower of Godsmack and Static-X)thought it sucked."
5,Nice lights,"I'm using them as reverse lights, and wired them directly to the vehicles existing harness. I didn't use the supplied harness, but it looked like it was well done. They're quite fine for the purpose that I'm using them."
3,Interesting story about the same old topic.,I was disappointed because I have read this before in many different formats. This book does have a romance which is an unusual twist. I would not recommend it for a self-help book because this message is out there and has been for decades. Tommy Newberry's books are excellent as are Robert Kiyosaki's and they show you the steps to take.
3,Not nearly as good as The Instant Millionare,"Perhaps I'm being too critical, but this book seemed a bit too fake. _The_Instant_Millionare_ by the same author was genuine, believeable, and worthwhile. This one (although I did read it and I did enjoy it) was not a life-changing book and I have not read it over and over again like The Instant Millionaire."
1,Waste of time,"Save your money, and avoid this book.The book suffers on three counts.First, its prescriptions are nothing that cannot be found in scores of self-help and positive thinking books, most notably the works of Norman Vincent Peale.Second, the lessons are woven into a badly-written story, or ""parable"". There are a lot of these parables floating around right now. I suspect the self-help authors like them because they can be used to dispense moral maxims without the burden of supplying proof or real-life examples. But if you are going to hand people life advice, you ought to be able to back it up. It is too easy to pass out sugar-candy.Finally, there is a lot of New Age nonsense in this thing. It undermines an already mediocre whole, and it adds nothing of use. Frankly it is weird."
3,I guess at the best it was alright.,Man I don't even know why I bought it because as I said at the most it was alright.
4,"Great shoe, but the heel's a little too high","Felt true to size, were really cute and were usual Nine West quality, but the heel was too high to be at all practical (and by practical, I mean worn with the usual amount of high-heel induced discomfort--I wear heels regularly). I would only have been able to wear them for a couple hours at a time and I was looking for an all-day work heel so I had to return them. Boo-hoo."
5,Great Deal,"I purchased these shoes knowing they were going to be high, but I have been looking for a pair of bronze shoes and these came closest to the price I wanted to pay for it. What a deal, they are gorgeous!!! It's true that they are a little difficult to wear for long periods but they are not uncomfortable. Usually in Nine West I wear 7 1/2 (8 in most other brands) so that's what I orderd and the fit was good as expected."
4,This book is great! I always carry it with me!,"This is a must for any apologetics library as well as anyone interested the truth of Christianity! It has tons of great info and Kreeft writes it in a way that keeps your interest. I have 50+books by atheists and Christians, this is the one I like the most; I have given answers to many atheists from this book. I gave this book a 4 star rating because it does not go too deep into some things, but it does cover many many subjects and gives great answers/arguments on most subjects. thanks, chris"
4,"worthwhile, but definitely from a catholic perspective","This book is a worthwhile read but it is important to note that it is clearly written from a catholic perspective. For example the author claims that when people claim that they are recalling memories from a past life (reincarnation) they are actually having people in pergatory speaking through them! Interesting that he never addresses the issue of pergatory...Also, the authors spend too much time on arguments that they admit themselves are weak. For example they will state an objection to Christianity/Theism and then give 9 arguments in defense. But three of those arguments will be extremely weak and not even worth mentioning. In this way the book is less practicle and more like an encyclopedia of arguments that have been used throughout history."
5,Excellent in every way,"I know Father Tacelli from earlier days, before he was ordained, and after he was ordained. The book he and Professor Kreeft have put together is, as I expected, brilliant. I* wish father Tacelli himself would write more and give us the benefits of his truly great mind.I recommend this to all Catholics and anyone interested in intelligent theology. Clear, concise, and spiritual in every way.Buy it now."
3,Informative,"The authors are strong in their use of philosophy, logic, and some psychology in their apologetics. But they are fairly weak in their use of contemporary science and contemporary Biblical interpretation. To say, for example, that the scientific proposal of biological evolution has little empirical backing and is probably losing ground today is inaccurate. And to say that Jesus clearly and strongly claims to be literally the ""Son of God"" (apparently in the eternal-ontological sense) simply is something not found in the gospels, despite his claim to some kind of divinity in only a few verses in the last-written Gospel of John. What is needed here are a more- sophisticated analysis of the notion of mission-functional divinity compared to eternal-ontological divinity, plus an analysis of the meaning behind some of the various gospel titles of Jesus.Harvey Bollich, Ph.D."
3,"great apologetics, weak doctrine","The apologetics areas of this book are wonderful, spot on. It's when he ventures into doctinal areas that it gets shakey. Some of his doctrinal statements are even false so just be careful."
1,So bad it's laughable,"I am an atheist. Now that we've gotten that out of the way...I have been searching for *good* apologetics books. After all, as a responsible atheist, I want to know how the religious defend their views. This book had many good reviews, so I figured it offered the best of the best of apologetics.Well, either I was very wrong, or else the deeply religious simply don't think very logically. There is no argument in this book that hasn't been amply refuted, dozens of times. There is very little here that would trouble even an armchair philosopher.This book could be used to teach a course- on logical fallacies. From begging the question to slippery slope arguments, to false generalizations- they're all here."
1,"prof kreeft, please do something else!","Having read this book, I kept asking myself why Peter Kreeft presumes to answer ""hundreds"" of questions about Christianity in such a glib and complacent way. Why does he not take into account the objections of the most important atheists of the 20th Century? (I hope he knows who they are.) And why does he continue to prey on people who have never heard a fair statement of the arguments of the other side? No major publisher would publish a book like this."
1,Garbage Can Material,"You have to be in the tiny range of Protestants and Vatican II Catholics, who love the present Vatican movement to merge Catholics and Lutherans as one religion, to buy any basic premise in this book. It will not teach you one valid thing that you can use to ""christianize"" anyone, and it can only serve as an emotional warm fuzzy if you fit the stated reader profile. You will not come away with any useful ""argument,"" but you could in a self delusion find yourself with your ""arguments"" pitted against others, such as well educated fundamental Christians and Traditional Catholics who have daggers five inches long.Buyer Beware. I threw my copy in the trash can."
3,Good foundational book,"Great foundation building to Christian faith, although a tough read for the laymen person just getting their feet wet. Breaks down the defense for faith to a ""molecular level""."
3,A reprint with a coda,"As another reviewer has noted, this ""new"" Handbook of Catholic Apologetics is merely a reprint of the authors' earlier work ofecumenically oriented Christian apologeticswith a 40-page Catholic coda. As such, it's a bit misleading to give it a new name, especially when that new name suggests that this book is something that it really isn't. Ignatius Press, a fine publishing house, ought to issue a clarification in their promotional materials."
5,Excellent Book,This book is an exceptional example of how logic and reason can be used to fortify arguments in favor of Christianity. A great resource for any Christian.
2,Very technical,"Was looking for a general apologetics book, but this is more of a textbook. Not exactly for sitting down for a causal read."
2,Don't expect too much if you are non-believer,"When I bought this book I was non-believer of Christianity who expect dramatic break through about Christianity from this book and I got badly disappointed. While the author did great job on some field but overall the book contains fundamental problems of Christian apologetics such as mentioning the bible to back up his logistics. For non-believer, it wouldn't work if you choose bible as primary reference for your explanation, since non-believer do not believe the bible itself. It is like explaining gravity to someone who doesn't understand the Newton's law itself. ""Because Newton says so"" wouldn't work. To make it work the author should see things as non-believer but it is as much hard as the non-believer tries to understand the believer. It is a good book but I have a doubt if it is useful book."
2,aren't we smart?,"This is a glib romp through difficult terrain. The authors seem to answer lots of questions, but after a while their answers become predictable and increasingly superficial. No problem is so tough that they can't solve. No doubt is so deep that they can't dispel. They write as if they are the C. S. Lewis of the 21st Century. They aren't."
2,Bad,"This book is, for the most part, badly argued. I would not recommend it, although it is a good representation of black-and-white mainstream Christian apologetics. Pick this book up if you want to know more about what conservative Christianity believes and the manner in which they believe, but not for a tightly argued polemic. There are better apologists out there."
2,Nice Concept - Negative Results,"I saw this product on one of the home shopping networks and was impressed with what I saw, but once I actually got it home, I was very disappointed. Although it's hook-up is suppose to be very easy, it turned out to be a nightmare. After you install the driver, and restart your computer, you have to plug the cord into the USB port, then plug the power cord into the scanner, then into the wall. It does not work with Adobe software, or any other applications, just the software they provide with it. I was never able to get this scanner going correctly, I suspect it does not run well with Windows 2000, even with a new downloaded driver off their site. Technical support at Mustek is next to none. My advice - do not buy it!"
3,Good Budget Scanner,"Scanner was pretty easy to set up, but we had some trouble with it crashing our operating system (MS Windows), so I had to email Mustek to get a fix. They were quick with a reply, that took care of the problem, but it is always frustrating when these things don't work perfectly when you get them.My other complaint is that the scanner only works with the programs that you need to install for the scanner -- and they aren't the popular programs that you already have installed, so you need to have more clutter on your desktop and need to remember what directories you have your files stored in.On the positive side, the scanner now works very well -- is easy to make adjustments to images, and the quality is half decent.All in all, it was an OK purchase, and we probably 'got what we paid for'.It is a good 'first scanner' for people who want to dabble with scanning and image manipulation."
2,Decent scanner,"This is a ""decent"" scanner for the beginner. I am no ""D"" person, meaning I am NOT of this digital generation, it took me only about 20 minuted to instal both the drivers and the Hardware. The USB port is the greatest.They also provide you with the power outlet.The software is extremely weak, to say the least. As we all know, your system is as good as your software. Their Tech support does not have an 800# and their web page is no help. This should not be the only scanner in the house or office."
1,merlin mustek bearpaw scanner 1200,I hate it! I was ripped off when I bought this. How could I know that I would never be able to ugrade it to a new Operating System. You could at least write new drivers for Windows XP and Windows 2000.I feel cheated!Rose Mary Hughes
1,Not Accurate and Not a Translation,"I know that there are people that are fanatical about the KJV, consider it the only accurate English translation of the Bible, and condemn all modern translations. Those people are idiots. The King James Version isn't a translation at all. It's a revision of 2 previous English translations, one of them being the Great Bible. When the KJV was released, it was met with just as much hostility as modern Bibles are. Even the second edition of the KJV differed from the first edition, so which is truly the ""Authoritative Version""? The problem is that people like to hold on to things that are familiar and treat everything unfamiliar with skepticism. People also love the KJV because of the majestic-sounding language. It sounds like it could be something that was spoken by God, even if it wasn't. The KJV wasn't the first English version; it wasn't the last; it has been proven to be inaccurate. Avoid it."
1,Disappointing,This was the worst piece of fiction I've ever read. The characters were cliched and their actions were just unbelievable. A total piece of trash.
5,I weep for the 1 stars,"How I weep for the 1 stars. Breaks my heart to hear people talk who do not know our Lord and Savior or treat this like book of of fairy tales. Forgive them Father, for they no not what they do, comes to mind. The BIBLE is life's instruction book. Written by hands of men, inspired by the Lord. Some passages might seem like they contridict one another but if YOUR READ THE ENTIRE BOOK it makes perfect sense! I have seen too many miracles happen in my life and the lives of others not to believe each and every word. I used to be cynical too, I used to feel the same way some of the 1 stars do until I met JESUS! Not that life is perfect, it rains on the just and unjust but believe me, it is a lot better with God on your side. Some people need to check out Jesse Duplantis' Heaven book."
1,Wait for the movie...,"If you must read this book, just check it out from a library or borrow it- you wont pick it up again.I just couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough. This ""God"" character loves us, doesn't love us, loves us... He just needs to make up his mind. In that respect (and more) he's not a very well thought out character. Him and the Jesus fellow. I first thought he was his son, but then he turns out to be him... but still his son... It kinda seems like the author just stole that idea from ""Fight Club"" but butchered it.Just wait for the movie, hopefully the special effects will save this awful book."
1,"Makes a great doorstop, but other than that.....","I found this book to be full of inconsistencies and it seemed to be written by old hippies on LSD, as the stories sound far too fantastic to be believed. All this talk about a 'virgin birth', an ark, a ghost rising from the dead, and some dude walking on water are head shakers.I don't recommend this long-winded, large book as 'light' reading.I was bored after reading it for 15 minutes."
1,BROADEN YOUR MIND!!!,"Instead of reading this, pick up THE WISDOM OF THE VEDAS by JC CHATTERJI. It contains more ACTUAL TRUTH on any one page than the Bible does in its entirety.Of course, if you're a Bible-lover, your mind is probably as impenetrable as a rock, because you've almost certainly been indoctrinated with threats of damnation and hellfire. (Would a ""God"" really do that to his ""beloved children""?)If you're open to the truth, read the Vedas. Then do a little research into quantum physics, and you'll learn that the Vedas are the ONLY ancient religious texts which accurately described the nature of the universe--thousands of years before the development of scientific instruments powerful enough to ""reveal"" the same truths. They were actually just confirming what the ancient Hindus knew long before Christ walked the earth."
1,Too preachy!!!,"Everyone in this book is a sinner. Except for maybe one guy (more later in the review)and most the narrators spend the last quarter of the book kissing up to him (or as they would call him ""Him"") I would only recommend this to people who want to read the much better Divinci Code. I think this book is a prequel. It fills in some of the back story of Jesus (the supposed non-sinner but we know the truth), but don't give us much information on his marriage. In sum, this book lacks the compelling characters and situations of Dan Brown. I not sure who the author of this book is but he has an ego bigger than his talent."
1,I like the leather though... its sexy.,"jesus! get over jesus already! he's dead and wont return. ohh and if he does do you honestly think he wants to see you christians wearing a cross?""its kinda like going up to jacky onasis with a rifle pendant... just thinking of john jacky, just thinking of john."" ~ [...]"
1,jesus christ why dont you come save my life now?,"dont take the bible too seriously folks... history loves repeating itself... theres very little to parade about, religions rise and fall like empires. big deal."
5,Most Valued Sleep Aid for Insomniacs,"I have suffered from insomnia for decades. I've tried various remedies, both folk and prescribed, to no avail. One night when I found there was no other reading material in the house I picked up this book. It was only three pages before I dozed off. It took me years to get through Genesis.Thank you King James for providing the most dull fiction ever to help insomniacs achieve blissful sleep!"
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST............,"If you are looking for a book written more 2,000 years ago by nomadic goat-herders this book is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!! I love it!But I do have two little nit-picking points to bring up.1) The 2nd half of the book is called the NEW TESTAMENT. Seeing as how its 2,000 years old shouldn't that be ""The Most Recent Testament""?I do like theRashomon (The Criterion Collection)plot device in this part of the book. It's like having a bunch of your buddies write your life story (obviously they are not gonna get it right).2) This book is brought up constantly as supporting Family with a capital F. Yet there is no mention of the main character's extended family and very little mention of his brothers and sisters. This is very confusing to me. How can it be pro-family if it doesn't mention His family? Any help you could give me on this would be appreciated.Thanks for the feedback."
2,Alright story lacks character development,"The story on a whole is drawn out with a plot that leads everywhere except to a conclusion. The ""good book"" is anything but. There is no character development, even for the most important roles, many large parts of the characters lives are left out without explanation, and too many chapters that have no actual point with helping the plot. There rarely seems to be a direction in the plot and when one comes about, the character dies and then there is another 300 page section with no main character. No other book is like it, and there is a reason for that."
1,Take this book and burn it,"This book is a fictional work of hateful literature. A towering monster of inveracity. It proves that most people do not have the liberty of thinking for themselves and are afraid of going to ""hell"".I seethe at the thought of how many trees were cut down to create this abomination."
1,Gotta have faith,"You have to have ""faith"" to believe this book. Plus, there's way too much sex and violence. And the main character is narcissistic. Is this filed under Fiction? It should be."
1,Not as advertised,"I had bought this book for my children, everyone had told me that it had a great reputation and people were calling it ""The Good Book"". Hardly! Who wrote this thing? Try explaining to your children why god had demanded thousands of foreskin. Reading further I find this book is filled almost entirely with stories of incest, rape, murder, mutilations, animal sacrifice and genocide. It almost went as far as saying that Jesus isn't white.At first I thought this was some sick prank being played by an Amazon employee with way too much time on his hands. After some research I think I have found that this isn't a normal bible. This is for fake Christians like Mormons or something.In short, if you're looking for the Bible you grew up with hearing the wonderful stories of how God created everything and Noah's Ark etc then you need to stay away from this filth."
2,Stuffy and Overrated,"Put it right on the shelf with the rest of the fiction.Sex, Violence, persecution, discrimination, racism, incest, murders aplenty... this book has it all. On top of that it's hard to read because of the archaic use of language.Written 50 years after the alleged death of Jesus. Translated by just about anyone who wanted to. REWRITTEN by every ruler who didn't like what the older version said.Why does the bible have more sex than a daytime Soap? Because sex sells."
2,Meh,"Starts off with a bang but kinda drags towards the middle. The author needs to do some work on pacing and climactic elements. Could've used a vampire, too."
1,Boring!,"I had to read this book when I was a kid. Wow was it bad. I swear it goes on and on and on... It never really comes to any conclusions. Apparently the people (yes, people) who wrote it just like to hear themselves contradict each other.If you want to read an ancient tome, try Homer's Odyssey. It's much more exciting (which isn't saying much)."
1,Thank you,At times I found this piece of fiction entertaining. I cannot possibly explain how stupid religion is.
4,Praying worked for me!,"I'm a person who is not without means, my friends are also somewhat involved in the world community. We prayed for chaos, riches, war and increased power from the turmoil, and, with a little help from our friends (who also prayed) it came true.We've got our own private army now, more gold than you shake a stick at and almost limitless power over our citizens who are content (via our friends in the media) to let us carry on and improve our situation (more to come!).Praise be!"
1,I've read better,"I gave it one star because they didn't have a lower class. The constant contraditions. It's derritive and uninspired, it's plagerized from other scriptures. There seems to be countless amounts of violence. They lack in high quality sexual encounters. They tell people not to be violent and to accept one another, then tell of destruction because one went against ""god's"" will. They tell to kill those that do not agree with another. Overall, I find the book to be quite pitiful. That and through the entire fairy tale it appeared that ""God"" had a split personality. It's obvious he is determined to damn others to hell, where his other personality takes over. They say that Jesus never sinned yet he did committ a sin by being born human. I do not reccommend this book to anyone unless they enjoy good fairy tales that make no sense."
1,AN ABOMINATION TO MANKIND,"Someone once asked me why I was such a skeptic concerning the bible. My response was that I simply read it. All the way through. Actually it's been 6 versions now. The KJV,NIV,KJV21,YLT,KJV 1628 and CEV (all the way through). At 48 years of age with over 25+ years of intense research and introspection I am still more convinced than ever that the King James Bible represents the worst in mankind's imagination, and has been responsible for more crimes against humanity than can be counted. It's up to the reader to decide how much time and effort they want to put into this complex and controversial book. I could list many reasons why not to take this book as anything but a literary work of fiction but that would be setting-up my views to the narrow minded bigots and not convince those who don't want to deal with the bible with an open mind. My only advice is to be brave, be honest with yourself, and value the truth more than anything, even your own desire to feel safe."
1,Bad Literature,"There is no plot, no storyline, the characters are horribly one-dimensional and it is completely unbelievable. Definitely one of the top 10 worst books ever written."
3,A little disappointed,I was somewhat disappointed upon receipt of this Bible. It is advertised as having large print but it is not as large as the description leads one to believe. I purchased this Bible for my husband who needed larger print. I am still looking for another Bible.
2,Too Long,"Since I was a child, people have been talking about this book. It seems to be talked about on the news and just in general conversation. I have to be honest. I am lazy and this book is just TOO LONG. I don't have time to read a book that is over 1000 pages. And this book is sneaky. It doesn't seem like it's so long, but the writing is on these pages that are as thin as t***** paper (the paper you use to wipe feces). I am sure this is probably an okay book, but I just don't have the time to read this whole thing."
1,Parental Advisory,"This book is in very poor taste. Between the rape, torture, murder, mass murder, and latent themes of homophobia this book is not for the faint of heart.Only the mad or abusive would allow a child anywhere near this, it would scar them for life."
4,Good but could be a touch bigger.,"The book is no frills almost exactly as i expected. Only thing is, i think the book could have been a touch bigger to accommodate slightly larger font or spacing because the font is bold, the letters feel almost too close and cluttered. I've gotten used to it and i like it still."
1,Worst fantasy novel I've ever read.,"I'm a pretty big fantasy and sci-fi fan but this book is pretty low on the heap, kind of on par with L. Ron Hubbard and maybe a little sub-par when compared to Robert Jordan. I mean there's no climax really and the plot is absolutely all over the place -- and the entire thing is just so bloody preachy."
1,Original Version,I know you can't buy the 1.0 version of the Bible. But these ripoffs have been rewritten some many times they don't make any sense. Surely God could come out with a new version if we prayed for it. I'd really like to get the audio book version with God himself doing the reading
3,Booooring,"A poor read for poor people. The 'Good Book' strings together a clumsy strand of second-hand, third-rate myths, metaphors and miracles, yet has the audacity to couch its claims to truth in these self-same, credulity-bending contrivances.Plus, the protagonist has a beard and long hair. I hate hippies."
3,"Pretty Cool Stuff, but Where are the pictures?!","I like my books to have lots of pictures and this one doesn't have any. That sucks.As for the story, it is sorta discombobulated and all over the place. I liked the story about the dude and the whale. Moby Dick is definitely a classic.There are a lot of contradictions in this story, but with a story this long, I am sure the author got plenty confused along the way! I mean, a couple chicks get their dad drunk and get him in bed! Sorta like that XXX movie ""Taboo,"" but this is read in Churches and stuff.I recommend this book for people who enjoy lots of cryptic sex scenes and gory violence. It is sorta like the Arnold movie, ""Commando,"" but with a message. Instead of Arnold destroying a South American country and killing a drug kingpin, The Bible has this ""Lord"" dude who kicks some serious ass! Lots of cool supporting characters, too. Just ignore all the stuff that doesn't make any sense."
1,SPOILER ALERT,"The character Jesus is arguably the best known in this ancient epic piece. However, he lacks charater development and is rather 1 dimentional. The author (s?) ignore his entire childhood, basically skipping the formative years which would explain his motivations better.I can't decide if Yaweh is supposed to be a protagonist or antagonist; his sadistic behavior towards his children is telling, even towards his 'favorite' kid. He seems to display a classic abuser's profile with declarations of love followed by abuse, torture, and finally a new declaration of love. Over and over.The Jesus charater is murdered in the end of the story, and his sadly delusional groupies imagine they see him again and long for some city in the clouds with gold streets. Pathetic.Overall: 1/2 star."
1,BELIEVE OR DIE!!!!!,"Here is the message Christians believe. If you don't believe in THEIR god you rot and burn in hell for all eternity. If you Christians really believed that god loves us then you would know he gave us free will and a conscience mind to do with it what we wanted. I believe in god, and I don't believe he is a belligerent, angry god throwing lightning bolts either. Yes, the Bible teaches moral value. But one of the comandments is not to covet thy neibors goods. If nobody coveted there neibors goods the cycle of capitalism would fail. Our economy would fall into disarray, jobs would be lost, ohhh NOOO. How about comandment five, thou shalt kill. How many people have died throughout history to the hands of religion. Please Christians, come down off your high horse, forget your Arthurian eld tales, and stop praying for people who don't wanna be prayed for. GOD IS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE UNIVERSE AND WE ALL ARE THE UNIVERSE, the bible is BULL---ONY"
4,Red Flower Goes West,"In muted tones and spare text illustrator Dennis Nolan and author Ann Turner together create a story of one family's westward journey. ""There's gold in California and free land, A man can't let that go by... Once Pa had an idea, no one could stop him"", ""Ma tightened her lips, dug a red flower... 'where I go, this flower goes too.' Pa had nothing to say to that"". And so begins a journey of peril where Red Flower becomes more than a geranium, it becomes a symbol of survival. The soft sepia tones are punctuated by the bright red geranium flowers emphasizing the importance of Red Flower. This book leaves with you a clearer idea of how scary it would have been to be a pioneer."
4,A nice add on to your kenwood radios.,"We used a pair of these headsets with our Kenwood UBZ-LH14 FRS radios while biking in Seney National Wildlife refuge. My wife found it hard to get the microphone in just the correct place (so that I could hear her talk, but not her breathing). She also had difficulty keeping the ear-bud in her ear. Just like the radios without use of the headset, there is a short pause before they transmit, thus cutting off some of the first word you broadcast. We generally liked the headsets; I had none of the problems that my wife experienced. The VOX function is great for hands free operation."
5,Nice!!!,"I didn't know what a difference new high-end components would make in updating my vintage 1982 mountain bike! I reworked my 1982 Specialized Stump Jumper (the original model) with all new high-end components from SRAM and WOW! What a ride! Perfect, effortless shifting every time! Highly recommended!"
5,Great!,This lil kinz bear is great because it's cheap and it's loads of fun! The bear comes with a code and unlocks a really fun website for kids. This toy is really great and it's fur seems to kind of sparkle. This was a great gift.
2,Careful With This Item,I purchased this item for a 1998 Ford Taurus. I could not find the installation instructions on-line before ordering. The installation seemed initially that it would be relatively easy. But to install this heater you need to establish a seperate coolant loop with the lower connection very difficult to connect into the cooling system. The heater also has to be mounted in a vertical position which can also be difficult to accomplish in the limted space of an engine compartment. I am sure that with enough time and effort this heater could be installed correctly. I returned the item because of the complexity of the installation. I am not a full time auto mechanic but I am able to accomplish most things that I set out to do on a car.
5,"Soft Sound Quality, Quiet","I don't know of another shaker like this. If you want not just a quiet shaker, but one that has a unique soft quality to it, this shaker is the only one to buy. The plastic feels like a soft vinyl to me and the resulting sound doesn't have the slightest hint of harshness.I'm not quite sure what LP had in mind designing this in a shaker pair held together with bands. You can separate them, but they actually sound better paired.Lovely sound."
3,Soft shaker,If you really want a shaker that is super quite then this is the one you want. It was just to soft for what I needed it for.
5,does the job,Used this in a rebuild of my 1998 era Broilmaster grill. Fit perfectly. Looks like an original part. Recommend using it.
3,Illiteracy Is A Mental Disorder,"These episodes are great, but your presentation of the titles leaves some doubt in the reader's mind as to what they are buying. The title of the last offering is ""Bang! You're Dead!"", not ""Band! Your're Dead!"" Sounds like you don't like musicians or something.....Besides, who would want this selection of shows when you can buy Seasons 1 & 2 of the classic ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" for a very reasonable price?Learn to spell, for crying out loud!"
5,Bisbalmania,"Anything David Bisbal is going to be awesome. If you have heard David sing - you will love this. If you have not heard David sing - Wowzers, you are going be a happy camper - because you have discovered ""David Bisbal"" and now you learn about ""Bisbalmania""."
5,A Strong Response But Wisely Researched,"Ah the joys of this Christian debate.I only want to mention a few things. First, read this book if you are (1) a seminary student, (2) a pastor dealing with this issue in your ministry, and (3) interested in a variety of well written articles on this debate.If you are looking for easy answers, this is not the book for you.Second, I took a class with Grudem in seminary on this particular issue, and suffice it to say I am still working on this issue. It is important to say here that he does truly care about women and that this book is an out growth of that concern. I don't think anything said in this book does otherwise (regardless if you disagree with the views presented).However, I would suggest that you would also read books on the other side of the issue. Even the four views book on this topic.Be informed of all the positions' points so that you truly sort out what is your stance."
1,"Piper, you disappoint me","Certainly, people who go into reading this book believing that women have no place in ministry will feel affirmed (and perhaps a bit smug), while those (particularly women) who feel the call of God to minister in a traditionally male setting within the church are only in for more heartache. I have to say I expected more of John Piper.For those who want to explore an evangelical approach to fully participating in ministry and life I recommend the books by Rebecca Merill Groothuis."
2,Uninspiring,"I don't have anything particularly enlightened to add on the topic, but I had Carson as a graduate student at Trinity. Brilliant man in many respects, but he is about the most priggish, self-important and reactionary person I've ever encountered. His level of conceit translates into a smug dismissal of any viewpoint that doesn't conform to his own moribund views of the world."
4,"Different roles, Equal value","I haven't finished this book yet, however I'm learning a lot from it.In many ways the material confirms my own position on these matters.But the clear Scriptural references that are given are very helpful in explaining the basic thoughts.I can recommend this book and I hope it will help many people with the aspect of male leadership both in the family as well as in the church.I'm very pleased that it makes it very clear that it is not a matter of playing the boss, but instead stresses the special responsibilities the man has towards women in general and his wife and children specifically."
1,"If you have a daughter, this book will scare you.","The book's whole concentration is on subjugating females to males. It's about all the things females are to do to serve the male sex, particularly the husband. There is almost nothing about what men or husbands are supposed to do for their wives.If the material in this book is correct, why would any woman want to get married? The way husband wife relationships are described in this book is that the relation exists for the benefit of the husband, not the wife. A woman would be better off single than being in the type of marriage relationship this book describes.If the material in this book is correct why would any woman want to attend church? Her only function would be as a servant to lift up the male leaders of the church. She would be better off spending her time elsewhere where she is permitted to use all her gifts.This book is the best argument I know for why women should not marry or go to church."
1,Very disappointing.,"I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women. Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule. The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level. I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read ""Discovering Biblical Equality."" It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women."
1,Painful reading,"I read this book only because I believe in gender equality and teach on the subject. I felt it was necessary to be fully aware of the traditionalist position on women. After reading this book I do feel more equipped to teach. And I am now more determined to aid in releasing women from the bondage of male-headship(as defined in this book.) In my experience I have found that the traditionalist/complementarian views on women have done nothing but cause pain and feelings of inferiority for women.In my opinion, the authors have a poor scriptural foundation for their position. I am horrified that they would be willing to subordinate Christ eternally in order to justify the subordination of women. I encourage anyone who is studying the issue to read many books on the topic before making a quick decision.We are all called to be like Christ. Christ not only treated women with dignity but he discipled them and sent them to preach the Gospel. The best thing to do his follow the example He set."
1,Ridiculously biased,"I was very disappointed with this book. The Biblical arguments are spurious, and much of the arguments are based on culture and anecdotes."
1,Not biblical!,"This book ignores all of the biblical instances of females in leadership positions. This position in indefensible and non-biblical. Change is coming to the church and books like this stand in the way of making women full equals in the family of God, as God intended."
3,An Honest Opinion,"Men are notoriously insensitive and frequently behave in ways demeaning to women. I know this to be true because I'm describing myself. This is why a femanist will never be convicted with such a book. By means of argument, reason, and so-called ""legalism"", you can't drive a woman to believe in God-endorsed gender roles when excluding love.May the women forgive us; and may God heal the women we've hurt.I've not read this work yet, but it sounds like a great work for men of the church to share with one another, so that they may in turn share it with their wives and their daughters. Numbers 30 was written with loving intentions (Mt 22:40)."
2,Not for small dogs!,"i put this on my pug and was horrified the first time he was shocked. the ""harmless"" zap knocked him on his back. my usually happy, easy-going puggy was apprehensive and afraid to move out of his corner.maybe this collar won't affect larger dogs quite the same way, but i think i'll stick with gates and verbal corrections."
1,This is a shock coller,"Purchased item to limit our dog's access to some areas of our house.....The item description leads one to believe that it works by sound emission, but actually uses SCHOCK to harm the dog when it gets near the transmitter. Absolutely inhumane."
3,This thing stinks!,"This blade may look cool and act cool because whenever it takes a hit it goes into endurance mode, but in reality this blade stinks! It always goes out of the stadium or into penalty pockets, and has no real power! Unless your trying to complete a KAi collection (this was his original beyblade in the show) DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,crap!!,all blayblade toys are crap the game takes NO SKILLjust money and luck and if your smart dont buy this
4,A good blade,I got this blade by luck I found it!!! I have won 47 60 battles my sister has a driger f but i defeat it with out losing any spin. If you want this blade to be better just swop attack ring with Draciel or Dranzer F.By this blade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-Ben
3,THIS BLADE IS AWSOME!,This blade is so cool. I just got it today and i took a few spins with it and it spins for a really long time. This blade rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Good Info, bad format","Although this book has a lot of good information, it will take you awhile to find what you need. It is poorly organized and sometimes wordy. While at first the books unique size and silky appearance are alluring, the book is heavy, does not fit well in my bookshelf and the shiny pages can make it difficult to read."
3,WOW!,"(Written by Monica)I enjoy learning about alternative healing methods. I also like to impliment what I learn.A lot of the things in this books are very interesting, but for me, were far from practical."
2,Disappointed,"With a name like Xerox and good reviews online, I decided to replace my slow old printer with a Xerox M750. What a disappointment! It was slow, noisy, and it shook itself silly everytime it printed something. I returned it and purchased a slightly more expensive printer (not a Xerox). I guess this is another example of getting what you pay for."
2,Great... For Text...,"I bought this product it looked pretty good... 1200x1200 res. 10 pages per minute in black, up to 6 in full color and seperate ink cartriges... So I set it up and it was working great... I printed a picture with it... it came out horrible even on best with Photo Paper... The Droplets are very easy to see and the colors where always washed out... So I thought... well it's got to be something in the settings... So I enable ""Picture Logic"" which made it come out darker but, the image was still washed out... Overall I would say that this printer in overal productivity and performance and I love the Bypass Door... But, if you are looking for a printer to print nice crisp color images... Go with something a bit more expensive... Maybe, though I didn't really like the quality, a Canon S450... but, I ended up spending more and getting a Hewlett Packard 932C and it works great Maybe also check out at Hewlett Packard 832C that was my second choice for less expensive printers..."
1,Lucifer's choice!,"This printer is (was) the work of the devil!Yes, the print quality was decent enough, but unless you had all four colour cartridges loaded it would make you go through hell to print out even a single sheet. You want to print out simple black and white text? Well, if you are out of Cyan, you are out of luck - the machine will not cooperate willingly, you have to trick it into working.This machine was designed as cripple-ware, all so that Xerox can force feed you their grossly overpriced ink.Even if you are offered one free, don't touch it!The two years I suffered with this unit has made me suspicious of all Xerox products..."
3,Expensive Print Heads,The printer performed excelent for almost a year with moderate use. We then discovered an ink buildup under the plastic coating that protects the print head. Our Blue ink will no longer print and the head is damaged. Replacement costs for the color print head are [dollar amount]. Looking for new printer.
4,A bargain for sure.,"I bought this printer 2 days ago at ...for [price]. I bought it to replace the HP 1000 that has become extinct and came up with a stack overflow error that is not fixable. I print business cards and find that a resolution of 1200 by 1200 makes a finer picture. It was easy to set up with the disk on Windows ME. It did not come with a printer cable.. major problem. Isn’t that customary?? The printer does vibrate like no body’s business. I started to buy a set of ink cartridges but noticed that would set me back [price]… and the print heads (no clue how long they last) cost [price] each. With these costs in mind, I decided to buy another printer…. Extra cartridges, extra print heads, extra everything. A really smart decision. At this price, it is a steal!! And with replacement parts an inexpensive as they are (hint) a bargain!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I have wasted hours trying to get this printer to work properly.Even when it was brand new, and sort of worked, the print quality was terrible with fuzzy characters and colors that were way off. And yes, I was using the right kind of paper.I have gotten about thirty barely usable pages out of this printer. After that it began to malfunction.Xerox did its customers and itself a big disservice by ever selling this piece of junk."
2,Is fine when it works....,I bought this because of price and have been paying dearly ever sense. They do not have a service center here in the sixth largest city in the United States. You have to deal with clowns thru e-mail that want you to take off of work to pay a toll charge so they will not be inconvienced. Mine constantly has to be reset and now after about 40 resets I think it has totally died. The color quality is not that good as others. Does not work well with my ME operating system and not at all with my 2000. I am going to go buy an HP....
1,had to send it back,"This printer worked for two months, then I had to send it back. While it was working, the text and photo printing were both decent, but not was as good in quality as the HP printer I was previously using."
4,Good quality for price...,"I was so impressed by the low price and comparable print quality of the M750 that I decided to try it instead. To date, I haven't had any problems with the machine and am quite pleased with its performance. It is a great piece of equipment for a home-based business or family-owned PC."
5,This CD is the stuff!!!,"If you like HARD HOUSE, try HARD HOUSE with HARDCORE. This will keep you freaking and and battling all night long. A must have CD for the hard house freaks."
4,"People should know about Aung Sa Suu Kyi, it's the only film about her, so watch it","The Lady has more than a little educational value and deserves to be watched. It is a nice tribute to a great woman, so I plan on watching it with my daughter when she is old enough. Girls need more role models like this. The world needs more people like this."
4,Excellent Movie,"Michelle acted as the Lady very well. Most of the movies that is based on a real story when they reveal the main character in real life they are somewhat different from the movie. But this one is very close to the real one.I am very impressed with her professionalism. She also learned Burma for the public speaches. But, if you are looking for some exciting plots in the movie you will be disappointed, remember the Lady has been house rested for over a decade. But, you will appreciate the courage, the determination and the persistence shown by the movie. I enjoyed it very much"
5,Wonderful movie,This movie really moved me and what a wonderful lady she had to have been to be so patient and brave.
5,Great interpretation,I wanted to see this movie so much I ordered it from the US. I was not disappointed. Michelle Yeoh really captured the character. What a change from her usual portrayals.So sensitive.
5,BRAVO,"This film told a true story of the selfless devotion to an honest cause, the dominion over the evil that presents itself to thought, and is a tribute to the true dignity of man. I LOVED it. Oh, that it were available to purchase on DVD...the lack of that is a matter of great sorrow to me."
2,100 Boating Mistakes,"If you are thinking about buying a boat, this may be helpful.(I suggest courses from your local Power Squadron). If you are a boater already, this does not add much."
5,Must Have for Cubs Fans,"The million to one team is probably the best book ever written on the Chicago Cubs. It goes through the problems the cubs have endured throughout their history, but doesn't dwell on them. It rather shows the missed opportunities that the management has gone through, and that we, as fans, should remain hopeful. George Castle goes through the trials and tribulations of the entire cubs history, and how botched trades or failures in drafts can hurt you not only for 1-2 years, but can still be stinging 4-5 years down the line. Mr. Castle paints a picturesque scene that could have been the cubs. He shows how the upper management is to blame for this ""million to one"" streak of seasons without a world series."
3,Great View into Cubs History,"This book does a good job of getting behind the scenes of Cubs management over the last half of the 20th century. It is a good source of management history for any serious Cubs fans. At times the book is overly negative, but this is expected from serious fans that have been heartbroken by the Cubs. Also, the author should have a serious talk with his editors as there are numerous errors. Overall, not the best book around, but it definitely does do what it advertises, which is give a good history of Cubs management."
1,Incorrect samples - incorrect album?,Can't believe after all this time since amazon were first alerted that the samples are still playing the wrong album. Is the download the correct album does anyone know?
1,Flawed,"This book is essentially a series of short essays on various topics loosely related to the works of JRR Tolkien. While some of these segments are well researched with references to obscure passages in Tolkien's writings, the majority are little more than self-important ramblings and speculations. Even in the research essays the author seems most comparable to David Day in that he can't seem to differentiate between things that Tolkien actually wrote and those things which are merely his own interpretations or preferences. He casually dismisses evidence damning to his own position or simply ignores it entirely.If you are looking for 'chatty' speculations on various topics about Middle-earth and don't much care about their accuracy this may be the book for you. If you are looking for serious literary analysis or unbiased research into Tolkien's less known works - look elsewhere. Carpenter and Shippey would be a good start."
4,"Great phone, but has some drawbacks.","I have the Alltel version of the 755p. This was my choice after years of using Palm's PDA devices. It can be a lifesaver -- or the source of headaches. It's great not having to carry a PDA, phone and lockbox key. This one device covers all three, and also plays mp3s. However -- the battery dies very quickly even though I stopped all programs from automatically updating (weather, email, etc). The phone must be plugged in every day or the battery dies. What good is a phone with all these features if the battery won't last a day? Also, Alltel does not support MMS (picture messages) on this phone. But other carriers do. I was not happy when I discovered this -- after I purchased the phone, and needed to send a picture to another phone."
1,On my second replacement phone - very disappointed,"Approximately 6 months ago I purchased the Verizon Palm Treo 755p. Ten days later it began to freeze-up, I was unable to use the touch-screen. I returned it for a new one. Then again, about two months later the second phone became slow to respond. Verizon had me do a full hard re-boot, but to no avail.I was then shipped a ""pre-owned"" replacement. It works OK, but on occasion will not respond, or just black out for a minute or so and then return. Not good when you urgently need to make a call.I recently met another Verizon 755p user, who also has encountered the very same issues and also needed to get a replacement phone.Bottom line, I wanted to really like this phone, but I wouldn't recommend it. I am seriously thinking about breaking my contract and looking at another product."
1,Doesn't work with Vista 64bit,"I have a Treo 650. I just bought a new laptop that came with Vista 64bit. Little did I know that NO PalmOne product is compatible with Vista 64bit and they (by the words of one of their customer reps today)are not working on a fix. Now I'm going to have to buy a new phone if I want to be able to sync. More and more new systems are shipping with Vista 64bit and many people are caught unaware of this fact. Please know if you buy this phone, it will not work with Vista 64bit as of the date of this review."
3,Nursery Rhymes,"i really love this book. it has all the rhymes i was hoping for. its the hardback first published in 1973, so if you are looking for all the oldies , you will find it in this book"
1,no fun,"I really can't say anything good about this game. The controls are way too slow, and the models are painfully simple. I only got through 2 levels before deciding that this game was not worth my time."
